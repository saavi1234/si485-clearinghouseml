    "summary": "<p>On March 28, 2005, three female plaintiffs, who had been arrested for minor offenses and were strip searched, filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky against Franklin County, Kentucky and Franklin County Correctional Complex. The plaintiffs challenged the strip search policy of the Franklin County Correctional Complex, alleging that they were strip searched pursuant to a blanket policy which required all female pretrial detainees entering the Complex to be strip searched, without any reasonable suspicion to believe the detainees were concealing weapons or contraband. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs claimed the strip search policy violated the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs sought actual and punitive damages, attorneys&rsquo; fees, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief, enjoining the defendants from utilizing any policy that forces female detainees of minor offenses to show their genitalia for visual inspection.</p>\r\n<p>Note that this case, <em>Black v. Franklin County</em>, followed a 1997 class action lawsuit styled <a href=\"../../../../case/10001/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Wilson v. Franklin County,</em></a> KY (JC-KY-13), which also challenged the strip search policy of Franklin County Correctional Complex. The <em>Wilson </em>case settled in 1999.</p>\r\n<p>On April 6, 2005, the plaintiffs in the Black case filed a motion to certify the case as a class action. The plaintiffs later withdrew the motion pending further discovery, with the consent of the defendants, and filed an amended complaint adding 24 new plaintiffs on May 9, 2005.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on various grounds, including (1) the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were barred by the one-year statute of limitations, (2) the plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit, which is required under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (&ldquo;PLRA&rdquo;), (3) the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, and (4) the plaintiffs failed to state a claim. Additionally, on June 8, 2005, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. And then on July 18, 2005, the defendants filed a supplemental motion to dismiss the original and the amended complaints.</p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2005, Judge Joseph M. Hood granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss the original complaint, the amended complaint, and their supplemental motion to dismiss. 2005 WL 1993445.The court dismissed Franklin County Correctional Complex as a defendant since it was not a legal entity capable of being sued. The court also dismissed the claims of 11 of the plaintiffs due to the statute of limitations and PLRA exhaustion grounds. The court also dismissed the Ninth Amendment and equal protection claims of the remaining 16 plaintiffs, except for one plaintiff&rsquo;s equal protection claim.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery ensued, and the case was reassigned on January 6, 2006, to Judge Karen K. Caldwell for all further proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2006, the defendants moved to strike the class action allegations from the plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint. On March 15, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion to table the defendants&rsquo; motion to strike and/or dismiss the class action allegation. On May 4, 2006, the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment, asking the court to dismiss certain claims because they were time barred or administrative remedies were not exhausted. On September 28, 2006, Judge Caldwell denied the motion to strike, but she set a deadline for the plaintiffs to file a motion for class certification. She also granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment with respect to the time-barred and non-exhausted claims. 2006 WL 2849863.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly thereafter, on October 2, 2006, the plaintiffs moved to amend their first amended complaint.On October 27, 2006, the defendants filed another motion for summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On December 29, 2006, Magistrate Judge J. Gregory Wehrman granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to amend the first amended complaint and extended the deadline for plaintiffs to file a motion for class certification. 2006 WL 8446198.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 29, 2006, and then they moved for class certification on January 26, 2007. The defendants opposed class certification and, in turn, moved for summary judgment on May 22, 2007. On March 26, 2007, Magistrate Judge Wehrman issued a report and recommendation stating the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss claims of identified plaintiffs be granted in part and that claims of two plaintiffs be dismissed with prejudice for failure to prosecute, failure to respond to discovery, and failure to comply with this court&rsquo;s orders. 2007 WL 9751957.</p>\r\n<p>On April 16, 2007, the court ordered the voluntary dismissal of six plaintiffs with prejudice. On April 19, 2007, the defendants again filed a motion for summary judgment. Prior to the court ruling on the motion, the plaintiffs attended a settlement conference on May 22, 2007, with Magistrate Judge J. Gregory Wehrman and settled the case.</p>\r\n<p>On June 11, 2007, Judge Caldwell had dismissed several plaintiffs from the case for failing to comply with discovery orders. The remaining plaintiffs and the defendants, who settled, filed an agreed order of dismissal which the court approved on August 20, 2007. The parties agreed to pay their own costs and attorney fees. Further details of the settlement were not disclosed. The case is closed.</p>",

Mitchell and Brittney Creech, Plaintiffs,\nfile this action complaining of the egregious and unjustifiable conduct of the Defendants\nnamed in the caption above. As morespecifically set forth below, Plaintiffs, after arrests\nfor minor offenses, were unlawfully and unjustifiably strip-searched by Defendants. It is\nthe purpose of this action to recover the actual damages Plaintiffs sustained as a result of\nDefendants’ conduct, as well as any punitive damages to which Plaintiffs are entitled,\nand to insure that no citizen is ever again victimized by the blatant and malicious\nviolation of constitutional and common law rights that were endured by Plaintiffs.\nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n2. Plaintiffs seek damages from Defendants under the Civil Rights Act of\n1871, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, for gross and unconscionable violations of the rights,\nprivileges and immunities guaranteed them by the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Accordingly, this\nCourt has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331 and\n1343. Plaintiffs also seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages under the\npendant jurisdiction of this Court for negligence, gross negligence and intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress. As Franklin County, Kentucky, is the location of all\nPage 2 of 13\n\nDefendant parties to this action and the location of all acts pertinent to this suit, venue is\nproper in this Court.\nIII. PARTIES\n3. Plaintiff, Tina Michelle Black, is a resident of Lawrenceburg, Anderson\nCounty, Kentucky. She is an unmarried female, age 32 years, at the time of the offense.\n4. Plaintiff, Maureen O. Mitchell, is a resident of Lawrenceburg, Anderson\nCounty, Kentucky, who is an unmarried female, and who was 41 years of age at the time\nof the offense.\n5. Plaintiff Brittney Creech, is a resident of Frankfort, Franklin County,\nKentucky, and who is an unmarried female, 18 years of age at the time of the offense.\n6. Defendant, Franklin County, at all times mentioned herein, employed,\nwas responsible for the establishment of policies either formally or by custom for, and\nwas responsible for the employment, training, supervision and conduct of, the officers\nand employees of the Franklin County Correctional Complex.\n7. Defendant, Franklin County Correctional Complex, at all times mentioned\nherein, employed, was responsible for the establishment of policies either formally or by\ncustom for, and was responsible for the employment, training, supervision and conduct of\nthe officers and employees of the Franklin County Correctional Complex.\n8. Defendant, James Kemper, Jr., was Director of the Franklin County\nCorrectional Complex at the time of the acts complained of, and as such established\npolicies formally or by custom for, and was responsible for the employment, training,\nsupervision and conduct of the officers and employees of the Franklin County\nPage 3 of 13\n\nCorrectional Complex. Ted Hammermeister is the current Director of the Franklin\nCounty Correctional Complex.\nIF. CLASS ACTION\n9. This action is brought, pursuant to FRCP 23, and other applicable law, by\nPlaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated whose joinder\nin this action is impracticable because the class is so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable.\n10. There are questions of law and fact common to the class, all as set forth\nhereinbelow.\n11. The claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the\nclass\n12. The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests\nof the class.\nV. NATURE OF DEFENDANT’S CONDUCT\n13. Defendants, individually and in conspiracy with one another, engaged in\nthe conduct described below under color of the law of the Commonwealth of Kentucky\nand Franklin County. The individual Defendants named above knowingly participated or\nacquiesced in, contributed to, encouraged, implicitly authorized or approved of the\nconduct described below individually and in their official capacities with Franklin\nCounty and/or the Franklin County Correctional Complex. The offenses described below\nresulted from the failure of Defendants to employ qualified persons for positions of\nauthority, and/or to properly or conscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such\npersons after their employment, and/or to promulgate appropriate operating policies and\nPage 4 of 13\n\nprocedures either formally or by custom to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens\nof the Commonwealth of Kentucky, including Plaintiffs. Defendants’ conduct was\nintentional or grossly negligent, indicated active malice toward Plaintiffs or a total and\nreckless disregard for and indifference to each of their constitutional and common law\nrights, and justifies an award of punitive damages in addition to the actual damages\nwhich the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover.\nVI. FACTS\n14. There are questions of law and fact common to the class. With respect to\nthe facts, on April 21, 2004, Plaintiff, Tina Michelle Black, was arrested in Franklin\nCounty, Kentucky, for a minor, non-violent offense (contempt for failure to pay child\nsupport). Plaintiff was taken into custody in the Family Court Division of the Franklin\nCircuit Court. Plaintiff was then transported to the Franklin County Correctional\nComplex, where she was subjected to a strip-search when there was no reasonable cause\nto believe that she was carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. Specifically,\nPlaintiff was required by a Franklin County Correctional Complex employee to remove\nall of her clothing so that a visual inspection of her person could be accomplished.\nPlaintiff was granted work release on May 11, 2004 and was on work release until June\n9, 2004. Plaintiff worked six days per week. Plaintiff was strip-searched each day after\nreturning to the jail from work release. Male inmates who arc on work release are not\nstrip searched upon their return to the jail\n15.    On March 29, 2004, Plaintiff, Maureen O. Mitchell, was stopped for\nspeeding in Lawrenceburg, Anderson County, Kentucky. At the time of her aforesaid\nstop, said Plaintiff’s operator’s license was verified by the Officer and determined to\nPage 5 of 13\n\nhave been suspended, and said Officer proceeded to place said Plaintiff under arrest on\nthe charge of operating a motor vehicle on a suspended license in violation of K.R.S.\n186.620. (The said Plaintiff’s operator’s license should not have been identified as\nsuspended on her driving history record, but improperly did due to a back log of\noperator’s license entries to be made by the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s\nTransportation Cabinet.)\nThe Officer then proceeded to conduct a search of said Plaintiff’s\nautomobile and purse. The Officer found prescription medicine of Plaintiff and her\nFiancee which had been placed in the ashtray of her car, and in a pill case in her purse.\nPlaintiff was then charged with speeding, possession of a controlled substance 1st, and\npossession of a controlled substance 3r~. Said Plaintiff was then transported to the\nFranklin County Correctional Complex, where she was subjected to a strip-search when\nthere was no reasonable cause to believe that she was carrying or concealing weapons or\ncontraband. Specifically, Plaintiff was required by a Franklin County Correctional\nComplex employee to remove all of her clothing so that a visual inspection of her person\ncould be accomplished, Plaintiff Mitchell was required to spread her leg~, stoop, and\ncough vigorously, all under the direct visual observation of a jail employee.\n16. On January 15, 2005, Plaintiff, Brittney Creech, age 18 years, was arrested\nin Lawrenceburg, Anderson County, Kentucky, for a minor, nonviolent offense of\ndriving under the influence (KRS 189A.010). Plaintiff Creech was taken into custody by\nLawrenceburg Police. Plaintiff was then transported to the Franklin County Correctional\nComplex where she was subjected to a strip search when there was no reasonable cause\nto believe that she was carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. Specifically,\nPage 6 of 13\n\nPlaintiff was required by a Franklin County Correctional Complex employee to remove\nall of her clothing, so that a visual inspection of her person could be accomplished.\nPlaintiff Creech was required to spread her legs, stoop, and cough vigorously, all under\nthe direct visual observation of a jail employee. Plaintiff Creech was released from the\nFranklin County Regional Complex, after having never been placed in the general\npopulation of the inmates, and approximately five (5) hours after her initial incarceration.\nPlaintiff Creech submitted to a urine test which indicated that she had no drugs in her\nsystem. She was not asked to take an intoxilizer examination.\n17. In 1979, the United States Supreme Court held that a pretrial detainee has\nthe fight not to be searched unless the reasonableness of such search is established by\n\"balancing ...the need for the particular search against the invasion ofpersonaI rights that\nthe search entails. On April 18, 1989, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its\nopinion in Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6t~ Cir 1989), cert.denied, 493 U.S. 977,\n110 S.Ct. 503 (1989), in which it held:\nIt was clearly established on October 21, 1986, that a pretrial detainee has\nthe fight not to be searched unless the reasonableness of such search is\nestablished by \"a balancing of the need for the particular search against\nthe invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" (Citations\nomitted). It was equally clearly established that a person charged only\nwith a traffic violation or nonviolent minor offense may not be subjected\nto a strip search unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the\nparticular person might be carrying or concealing weapons or other\ncontraband.\nId. At 1257 (Emphasis in original). Masters specifically involved the strip-search of a\nperson arrested for a nonviolent minor offense by the Jefferson County Department of\nCorrections. In this case, Plaintiffs were arrested for nonviolent minor offenses. Neither\ntheir behavior nor their appearance gave Defendants any reasonable grounds for\nPage 7 of 13\n\nbelieving that they might be carrying or concealing weapons or other contraband. Under\nsuch circumstances, Defendants’ requirement that Plaintiffs expose the most private part\nof their physical person for a visual inspection was unconscionable, was an illegal strip-\nsearch by any definition, and was a flagrant violation of the balancing requirement of\nBell v. Wolfish, sul3ra.\nVII. CAUSES OF ACTION\nA. Count l\n18. Paragraphs 1-17 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this\nParagraph 18.\n19. Plaintiffs’ search, described above, was part of a continuing pattern of\nmisconduct and is the result of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, procedures,\ncustoms and practices of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Franklin County, either\nwritten or unwritten, that are systematically applied whenever an arrestee is admitted to\nthe Franklin County Correctional Complex. A judgment was recently entered against tile\nDefendants for similar misconduct and the Defendants continue to perform illegal strip-\nsearches. Such practices constitute an arbitrary use of government power, and evince a\ntotal, intentional and unreasonable disregard for the constitutional and common law\nrights of the citizens of Kentucky, including Plaintiffs and the wholesale violations of\nthose rights likely to result from the systematic pursuit of such practices.\n20.    As the result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs, through Defendants’ intentional\nor grossly negligent conduct, were deprived without due process of law of the following\nrights, privileges and immunities guaranteed to each of them by the Constitution of the\nUnited States in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983:\nPage 8 of 13\n\n(a) Their right to be secure in their persons against\nunreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendments;\n(b) Their right to privacy in their persons against\nunreasonable intrusions under the Fourth, Fifth,\nNinth and Fourteenth Amendments;\n(c) Their right to the equal protection of the law secured\nby the Fourteenth Amendment; and\n(d) Their right not to be subj coted to cruel and unusual\npunishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments.\n21. Moreover, given the preexisting law that clearly prohibited Defendants’\nconduct and the recent entry of a judgment against these same Defendants for this same\nconduct, Defendants search of Plaintiffs was intentional, wanton and malicious, and was\nindicative of Defendants’ total and reckless disregard of, indifference to the rights of, and\nrisk of harm to, Plaintiffs.\nB. Count II\n22. Paragraphs 1-21 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this\nParagraph 22.\n23. By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants intentionally and unjustifiably\ninflicted upon Plaintiffs severe mental and emotional distress.\nC. Count III\n24. Paragraphs 1-23 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this\nParagraph 24.\n25, By virtue of the foregoingD, efendants were negligent, and grossly\nnegligent, all to the damage of Plaintiffs.\nPage 9 of 13\n\nVIII. DAMAGES\n26. Paragraphs 1-25 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this\nParagraph 26.\n27. Plaintiffs were unjustifiably and unconstitutionally searched in a manner\nthat generated tremendous and overwhelming embarrassment, humiliation and mental\nand emotional distress. As a result, Plaintiffs have suffered, and are entitled to recover,\nactual damages. Furthermore, Defendants’ violations of the constitutional and common\nlaw rights of Plaintiffs were cruel, malicious, and evinced a total and reckless disregard\nfor and indifference to those rights, entitling Plaintiffs to recover punitive damages from\nDefendants in order to deter such conduct in the future.\nIX. DE CLARA TORY JUDGMENT AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n28. Paragraphs 1-27 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this\nParagraph 27.\n29. In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiffs requests that this Court issue a\ndeclaratory judgment deeming unconstitutional any and all statutes, ordinances,\nregulations, policies, procedures, customs or practices under which they were forced to\nexpose their genitalia for visual inspection, and further request that this Court\npermanently enjoin Defendants from following or enforcing such statutes, ordinances,\nregulations, policies, procedures, customs or usages.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves, and all other members of the\nclass, respectfully demand the following retief: (a) trial by jury, (b) for an award of\nactual and punitive damages, (c) that they be granted the declaratory and injunctive relief\nrequested herein, and (d) that they be awarded their costs, attorneys’ fees and all other\nPage 10 of 13\n\nrelief to which they are entitled under law or in equity.\nVERIFICATION\nI, Tina Michelle Black, Maureen O.

FACTS\n8\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 76-2     Filed 10/02/2006     Page 9 of 23(cid:10)\n49. There are questions of law and fact common to the class.  Plaintiffs reiterate each \nand every allegation contained in the original Complaint filed herein, and more specifically, \nthose allegations contained in numerical paragraphs 14, 15, and 16.\n50. With respect to the facts, on January 28, 2005, Jeffrey Curtis, was arrested in \nFranklin County, Kentucky, after having been found in contempt of court by the Franklin District \nCourt for failure to pay fines, and failure to attend classes at Kentucky Alternatives Program.  \nPlaintiff was then transported to the Franklin County Correctional Complex  where  he  was \nsubjected to a strip search when there was no reasonable cause to believe that he was carrying or \nconcealing weapons or contraband.  Specifically, Plaintiff was required by a Franklin County \nCorrectional Complex employee to remove all of his clothing, so that a visual inspection of his \nperson could be accomplished. Plaintiff Curtis was not strip searched initially when brought into \nthe jail, but was strip searched several days after his initial incarceration.\n51. Plaintiff,  Wendy  Hockensmith,  on  June  28,  2004,  was  arrested  in  Franklin \nCounty, Kentucky, and charged with improper use of electronic equipment, which charge was \nultimately dismissed.  After Plaintiff was taken into custody by police, she was transported to the \nFranklin County Correctional Complex where she was subjected to a strip search when there was \nno reasonable cause to believe that she was carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiff was required by a Franklin County Correctional Complex employee to \nremove all of her clothing, so that a visual inspection of her person could be accomplished.  \nPlaintiff Hockensmith was required to spread her legs, stoop, and cough vigorously, all under the \ndirect visual observation of a jail employee.\n52. Plaintiff, Deidra Wash, was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, \nthird offense, in Franklin County, Kentucky.  Plaintiff was incarcerated in the Franklin County \n9\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 76-2     Filed 10/02/2006     Page 10 of 23(cid:10)\nCorrectional Complex.  Initially, Plaintiff was not strip searched.  It was not until several days \nlater, on or about February 8, 2005, after having been taken to Court for a hearing on her case, \nthat Plaintiff was strip searched by the jail official, having been required to remove all of her \nclothing under the visual inspection of a jail employee.  At the time when Plaintiff was strip \nsearched, there was no reasonable cause to believe she was carrying or concealing weapons or \ncontraband.\n53. Plaintiff, Rebecca Hagan, on March 27, 2004, was charged with possession of \ndrug paraphernalia, operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicants, and possession \nof marijuana, in Anderson County, Kentucky.  Those charges are still pending.  Plaintiff Hagan \nwas taken into custody by Lawrenceburg Police, and later transported to the Franklin County \nCorrectional Complex where she was subjected to a strip search when there as no reasonable \ncause to believe that she was carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  Specifically, \nPlaintiff was required by a Franklin County Correctional Complex employee to remove all of her \nclothing, so that a visual inspection of her person could be accomplished.  Plaintiff Hagan was \nrequired to spread her legs, stoop, and cough vigorously, all under the direct visual observation \nofa jail employee.\n54. Plaintiff, Karen  Gamble,  was  charged  in  Anderson  County, Kentucky,  with \nAssault  IV.    As  a  result  of  a  plea  agreement  entered  by  her  with  the  Commonwealth  of \nKentucky, Plaintiff was required to serve 2 days in the Franklin County Correctional Complex.  \nPlaintiff reported for service of her sentence on October 27, 2004, at 6:00 p.m. at the Franklin \nCounty Correctional Complex.  After arrival, Plaintiff was instructed to go into a room where \nthere was a shower, a shelf unit with clothes and bins of flip flops.  Plaintiff was told by a jail \nemployee to strip off al of her clothing, including all under garments.  Plaintiff asked, but was \n10\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 76-2     Filed 10/02/2006     Page 11 of 23(cid:10)\nrefused, to be allowed to wear her under garments.  Plaintiff was made to stand in front of the jail \nemployee naked, raise her arms, then bend over and shake her hands through her hair.  Plaintiff \nwas made to open her mouth and raise her tongue.  After this, Plaintiff was instructed to turn \naround, facing away from the guard, bend over and spread her buttocks open for the guard to see \ninside her rectal area.  There was no reasonable cause to believe that Plaintiff was carrying or \nconcealing weapons or contraband.\n55. That Plaintiff, Angela Nesselrode, was charged in Clark County, Kentucky, and \ntransported from Clark County jail to Franklin County Correctional Complex on March 7, 2005, \non charges of contempt of court for failure to appear, and failure to pay fines.  Plaintiff was not \ninitially strip searched upon her arrival at the jail.  She was, however, on March 8, 2005, strip \nsearched by a jail employee.  On March 10, 2005, she was moved to general population, at which \ntime she was informed that jail policy is to strip search all female prisoners who are moved to the \ngeneral population.  Thus, again on March 10, 2005, Plaintiff Nesselrode was subjected to a strip \nsearch when there was no reasonable cause to believe that she was carrying or concealing \nweapons or contraband.  Specifically, Plaintiff was required by a Franklin County Correctional \nComplex employee to remove all of her clothing, so that a visual inspection of her person could \nbe  accomplished.    Plaintiff  Nesselrode  was  required  to  spread  her  legs,  stoop,  and  cough \nvigorously, all under the direct visual observation of a jail employee on each of the two (2) \noccasions when she was strip searched.\n56. Plaintiff, Penny Tillett, was arrested on March 6, 2004, for theft by deception and \ncontempt of court in Franklin County, Kentucky.  On March 8, 2004, Plaintiff Tillett had a \nhearing in Franklin District Court.  Later on March 8, 2004, when Plaintiff was back at the jail, \nshe was informed that she was being moved to back to the general population, and that she \n11\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 76-2     Filed 10/02/2006     Page 12 of 23(cid:10)\nneeded to shower in advance of the move.  The female officer who was moving her made \nPlaintiff strip off all of her clothing, including all under garments.  Plaintiff had to stand in front \nofthe jail employee naked, raise her arms, lift her breasts so that the guard could see under them, \nthen turn around, facing away from the guard, bend over and cough.  There was no reasonable \ncause to believe that Plaintiff was carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.\n57. Plaintiff, Tommy Cummins, was arrested in Franklin County, Kentucky, in May \nof 2004, on contempt for failure to pay fines. Plaintiff Cummins was taken into custody by \npolice.  Plaintiff was later transported to the Franklin County Correctional Complex where he \nwas subjected to a strip search when there was no reasonable cause to believe that he was \ncarrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  Specifically, Plaintiff was required by a Franklin \nCountyCorrectional Complex employee to remove all of his clothing, so that a visual inspection \nofhis person could be accomplished.\n58. Plaintiff, Jillian Baker, was arrested on March 19, 2005, in Franklin County, \nKentucky, on charges of failure to appear and failure to pay fines.  She was taken into custody, \nand taken to the Franklin County Correctional Complex, but was never placed into the general \npopulation.  Nevertheless, Plaintiff was subjected to a strip search when there was no reasonable \ncause to believe that she was carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  Specifically, \nPlaintiff was required by a Franklin County Correctional employee to remove all ofher clothing, \nso that a visual inspection of her person could be accomplished.  Plaintiff Baker advised the jail \nofficer that she was wearing a tampon, but was still required to bend over naked before the \nguard.  Further, the Plaintiff was required to lift her breasts in order that the guard could see \nunder them.\n12\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 76-2     Filed 10/02/2006     Page 13 of 23(cid:10)\n59. Plaintiff, Sandra  McClease,  was  arrested  August  2003  for  extortion  and  in \nNovember of 2003 for theft by deception.

In 1979, the United States Supreme Court held that a pretrial detainee has the \nright  not  to  be  searched  unless  the  reasonableness  of  such  search  is  established  by \n“balancing…the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.  On April 18, 1989, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinion in \nMasters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503 \n(1989), in which it held:\nIt was clearly established on October 21, 1986, that a pretrial detainee has the \nright not to be searched unless the reasonableness of such search is established by \n“a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal \n18\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 76-2     Filed 10/02/2006     Page 19 of 23(cid:10)\nrights  that  the  search  entails.”    (Citations  omitted).    It  was  equally  clearly \nestablished that a person charged only with a traffic violation or nonviolent minor \noffense may not be subjected to a search unless there are reasonable grounds for \nbelieving that the particular person might be carrying or concealing weapons or \nother contraband.\nId. at 1257 (emphasis in original).  Masters specifically involved the strip-search of a person \narrested for a nonviolent minor offense by the Jefferson County Department of Corrections.  In \nthis case, Plaintiffs were arrested for nonviolent minor offenses.  Neither their behavior nor their \nappearance gave Defendants any reasonable grounds for believing that they might be carrying or \nconcealing weapons or other contraband.  Under such circumstances, Defendants’ requirement \nthat Plaintiffs expose the most private part of their physical person for a visual inspection was \nunconscionable, was an illegal strip-search by any definition, and was a flagrant violation of the \nbalancing of Bell v. Wolfish, supra.\nVII.  CAUSES OF ACTION\nA.  Count I\n76. Paragraphs  1-75 above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 76.\n77. Plaintiffs’ search, described above, was part of a continuing pattern of misconduct \nand is the result of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, procedures, customs and practices \nof the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Franklin County, either written or unwritten, that are \nsystematically applied whenever an arrestee is admitted to the Franklin County Correctional \nComplex.  A judgment was recently entered against the Defendants for similar misconduct and \nthe Defendants continue to perform illegal strip-searches.  Such practices constitute an arbitrary \nuse of government power, and evince a total, intentional and unreasonable disregard for the \n19\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 76-2     Filed 10/02/2006     Page 20 of 23(cid:10)\nconstitutional and common law rights of the citizens of Kentucky, including Plaintiffs and the \nwholesale violations of those rights likely to result fromthe systematic pursuit of such practices.\n78. As  the  result  of  the  foregoing,  Plaintiffs,  through  Defendants’  intentional  or \ngrossly negligent conduct, were deprived without due process of law of the following rights, \nprivileges and immunities guaranteed to each of them by the Constitution of the United States in \nviolation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983:\n(a) Their right to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches \nand seizures under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments;\n(b) Their right to privacy in their persons against unreasonable intrusions \nunder the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments;\n(c) Their right to the equal protection of the law secured by the Fourteenth \nAmendment; and\n(d) Their right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment under the \nEighty and Fourteenth Amendments.\n79. Moreover, given the pre-existing law that clearly prohibited Defendants’ conduct \nand  the  recent  entry  of  a  judgment  against  these  same  Defendants  for  this  same  conduct, \nDefendants search of Plaintiffs was intentional, wanton and malicious, and was indicative of \nDefendants’ total and reckless disregard of, indifference to the rights of, and risk of harm to, \nPlaintiffs.\nB.  Count II\n80. Paragraphs  1-79  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 80.\n81. By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants intentionally and unjustifiably inflicted \nupon Plaintiffs severe mental and emotional distress.\nC.  Count III\n20\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 76-2     Filed 10/02/2006     Page 21 of 23(cid:10)\n82. Paragraphs  1-81 above  are  incorporated  herein  by reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 82.\n83. By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants were negligent, and grossly negligent, all \nto the damage of Plaintiffs.\nVIII.  DAMAGES\n84. Paragraphs  1-83 above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 84.\n85. Plaintiffs were unjustifiably and unconstitutionally searched  in  a  manner  that \ngenerated tremendous and overwhelming embarrassment, humiliation and mental and emotional \ndistress.  As a result, Plaintiffs have suffered, and are entitled to recover, actual damages.  \nFurthermore, Defendants’ violations of the constitutional and common law rights of Plaintiffs \nwere cruel, malicious, and evinced a total and reckless disregard for and indifference to those \nrights, entitling Plaintiffs to recover punitive damages from Defendants in order to deter such \nconduct in the future.\nIX.  DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n86. Paragraphs  1-85 above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 86.\n87. In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiffs request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment  deeming  unconstitutional any  and  all  statutes,  ordinances,  regulations,  policies, \nprocedures, customs or practices under which they were forced to expose their genitalia for \nvisual  inspection,  and  further  request  that  this  Court  permanently  enjoin  Defendants  from \nfollowing or enforcing such statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, procedures, customs or \nusages.\n21\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 76-2     Filed 10/02/2006     Page 22 of 23(cid:10)\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves, and all other members of the class, \nrespectfully demand the following relief:  (a) trial by jury, (b) for an award of actual and punitive \ndamages, (c) that they be granted the declaratory and injunctive relief requested herein, and (d) \nthat they be awarded their costs, attorneys’ fees and all other relief to which they are entitled \nunder law or in equity.\nRespectfullysubmitted,\nS.

Plaintiffs only response is to request additional\ntime,1 until October 1, 2006 “due to the number of\nplaintiffs.”  Only sixteen plaintiffs remain at this time. \nPlaintiffs are forewarned that their response does not\ndemonstrate good cause for the overdue responses. \nNevertheless, in light of the recency of the referral of this\nmotion to the undersigned and the fact that the requested\n     1As defendants note in a reply memorandum, plaintiffs’\nresponse itself was untimely.\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 71     Filed 09/08/2006     Page 2 of 7(cid:10)\nextension is just 22 days away, the court will grant the\nextension on this occasion.\nOn July 21, 2006, plaintiffs moved to compel defendants\nto produce both written records and an additional Rule\n30(b)(6) witness concerning defendants’ strip search policies. \nSpecifically, plaintiffs seek copies of all strip search forms\nfor all inmates confined between March 28, 2004 and the\npresent, as well as copies of inmate files for 56 inmates\nidentified in plaintiffs’ Rule 26(a) disclosures.2  \nDefendants object to production of any inmate records\noutside of those pertaining to plaintiffs, on the basis that\nthis case has not yet been certified as a class action and\ndefendants’ motion to strike class action allegations remains\npending before the court.  Therefore, defendants argue that\ninformation pertaining to inmates other than plaintiffs is\nirrelevant.  Defendants also cite privacy concerns, and the\nburden and expense of searching and copying the records of\nother inmates.  \n     2In a Memorandum Opinion and Order of August 16, 2005, the\ncourt  partially  granted  defendants’  motions  to  dismiss  the\nclaims of certain plaintiffs.  The court held that the claims of\nany plaintiff whose claims arose more than a year prior to the\ndate the amended complaint was filed (5-9-05)would be dismissed\nas barred by the statute of limitations, reasoning that the\nclaims of new plaintiffs do not relate back to the date the\ncomplaint was filed (3-28-05).\n2\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 71     Filed 09/08/2006     Page 3 of 7(cid:10)\nWith respect to the production of a Rule 30(b)(6)\nwitness, defendants state that they have no objection to\nproducing a witness on the subject “of the strip search\npolicies and procedures and application thereof” as requested\nby plaintiffs’ counsel via correspondence dated May 31,2006,\nbut that plaintiffs never issued a Notice of Deposition for\nsuch a representative and failed to respond to defendants’\nrequest for more detailed information concerning the subject\nmatter of the representative’s testimony.  Defendants also\ncomplain generally that, while they are willing to produce a\nRule 30(b)(6) witness, they should not be forced to produce\nwitnesses for deposition prior to being able to complete\nplaintiffs’ depositions, which have been stalled pending\nreceipt of plaintiffs’ responses to written discovery.  \nPlaintiffs filed no reply to defendants’ response.3\nPlaintiffs’ motion concerning defendants’ responses to\nwritten discovery requests will be denied absent a stronger\nshowing of relevance or class certification.  Plaintiffs’\nmotion to compel a Rule 30(b)(6) representative will be denied\n     3In their initial motion to compel, plaintiffs partially\naddress the issue of timing, noting correctly that the Federal\nRules do not permit one party to insist on production by another\nparty prior to providing discovery.  Nevertheless, plaintiffs\noffer to produce “three or four of their plaintiffs prior to or\nsimultaneously with the requested [Rule 30(b)(6)] deposition.”\n3\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 71     Filed 09/08/2006     Page 4 of 7(cid:10)\nfor failure to comply with LR 37.1 as it does not appear that\nplaintiffs have exhausted good faith extrajudicial efforts to\nschedule the Rule 30(b)(6) representative prior to bringing\nthe dispute before this court.  \nPlaintiffs have also moved for five OR six months\nextension of the pretrial deadlines agreed to by the parties\nand adopted by this court on November 14, 2005.4  Although no\nprior extensions of the pretrial scheduling deadlines have\nbeen granted, the sole basis provided for the proposed lengthy\nextension is the current discovery dispute and defendants’\nrefusal to produce the records of non-party inmates. \nDefendants oppose any extension unless the court certifies\nthis litigation as a class action.  \nWhen a motion is made after the expiration of a deadline,\n“excusable neglect” must be demonstrated for the party’s\nfailure to act in a timely manner.  Rule 6(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. \nIn this case, defendants argue that plaintiffs have failed to\nmeet this standard despite filing their motion for extension\nafter the expiration of deadlines to amend the pleadings and\nto complete Rule 26(a)(2) expert disclosures.  Defendants also\ndispute plaintiffs’ contention that they need additional\n     4For the most part, plaintiffs seek an extension of five\nmonths.    However,  plaintiffs  seek  at  least  a  six  months’\nextension of the deadline to amend their pleadings.\n4\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 71     Filed 09/08/2006     Page 5 of 7(cid:10)\ndiscovery prior to producing expert reports, noting that\ndefendants produced the strip search reports and inmate files\nfor all plaintiffs, as well as FCCC policies and procedures,\nover seven months ago.\nThe court having reviewed the pending motions, IT IS\nORDERED:\n1.  Defendants’ motion to compel discovery [DE #58] is\ngranted in part, but plaintiffs’ request for additional time\nlikewise will be granted.  Plaintiffs shall respond to the\noutstanding discovery not later than October 1, 2006.

A sixth motion, filed by defendants for summary judgment, will be submitted to the \npresiding district judge. \nBackground \nThe presiding district judge previously set forth the factual background of this litigation \nin a Memorandum Opinion and Order filed on August 16,2005: \nAll of the claims in this original complaint and amended complaint arise hom alleged \nstrip searches conducted upon Plaintiffs at the Franklin County Correctional \nComplex (“FCCC”).  Generally, the original and amended complaints allege that \npersonnel at the FCCC strip searched Plaintiffs after Plaintiffs were arrested for \nvarious minor, nonviolent offenses. ... \nPlaintiffs filed the original complaint in this case on March 28, 2005. On April 6, 2005, \nPlaintiffs filed a motion to certify class, which Plaintiffs thereafter withdrew via \nan Agreed Order with Defendants. On May 9,2005, Plaintiffs then filed an \nAmended Complaint, adding 24 new Plaintiffs. . .. \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 2 of 13(cid:10)\nDE #35 at pp. 1-2. In its Memorandum Opinion and Order, the district court granted in \npart defendants’ motion to dismiss and supplemental motion to dismiss and dismissed the claims \nof eleven plaintiffs.  The court also dismissed claims against the FCCC, the plaintiffs’ Ninth \nAmendment claims and the Equal Protection claims of all plaintiffs except for plaintiff Black. \nAs noted by the district court in a subsequent Opinion and Order filed on September 28, \n2006, “there are currently 16 Plaintiffs in this action, all of whom assert that the Defendants \nviolated their Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. In addition, Plaintiff Black asserts an \nEqual Protection claim.”  DE #72, p. 1. \nAnalysis \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend their Complaint [DE #76] \nOn October 2, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend their complaint to add 13 new \nplaintiffs. Defendants oppose plaintiffs’ motion, suggesting that this court’s prior order granting \nplaintiffs leave to amend their pleadings contemplated only the addition of new claims rather \nthan additional parties. \nAmendment of pleadings is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), which states in relevant \npart that “[a] party may amend the party’s pleading once as a matter of course . . . Otherwise a \nparty may amend the party’s pleading only by leave of court . . . and leave shall be freely given \nwhen justice requires.”  The order granting the plaintiffs an extension of time in which to amend \ntheir pleadings does not bear the restrictive interpretation ascribed to it by the defendants. In \ndeciding whether to grant a plaintiffs motion to amend their pleadings, “the court should \nconsider the delay in filing, the lack of notice to the opposing party, bad faith by the moving \nparty, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments, undue prejudice to the \n2 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 3 of 13(cid:10)\nopposing party, and futility of amendmentt.” Perkins v. Am. Electric Power Fuel Supply, Inc., \n246 F.3d 593, 605 (6” Cir. 2001). None of the Perkins factors militate against permitting the \nrequested amendment. Plaintiffs’ motion falls within the time frame prescribed by the court, and \nthere is no evidence that the plaintiffs have unduly delayed discovery. \nDefendants’ restrictive interpretation of the court’s prior order extending the time to \namend is also undermined by the court’s order of September 28,2006.  (D.E. #72).  In denying \nthe defendants’ motion to strike plaintiffs’ class allegations in that order, the court noted that \nplaintiffs’ counsel had received numerous communications from third parties complaining of \nsimilar treatment at the hands of the defendants. The court extended the discovery period to \nallow time for plaintiffs to investigate, among other things, new complaints from unknown \nplaintiffs. Judicial economy is promoted by the joining of all relevant parties.  Therefore, \nplaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint will be granted. \n2.  Defendants’ Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ Expert Witness [DE #79] \nThe defendants have moved to strike the plaintiffs’ expert pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P \n37(c)(l).  The defendants claim that the both the initial and amended expert disclosure reports \noffered by the plaintiffs fail to meet the standards laid out in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B) and were \nfiled after the October 1, 2006 deadline. Plaintiffs respond by first arguing that the original \nreport met the requisite standards, given the stage of the discovery completed at that time. \nSecond, plaintiffs assert that any deficiencies in the original report are remedied by the amended \nreport filed in opposition to defendants’ motion to strike. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B) explains the disclosure requirements for experts: \nExcept as otherwise stipulated or directed by the court, this disclosure shall, with \nrespect to a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert \n3 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 4 of 13(cid:10)\ntestimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party regularly \ninvolve giving expert testimony, be accompanied by a written report prepared \nand signed by the witness.  The report shall contain a complete statement of all \nopinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefore; the data or other \ninformation considered by the witness in forming the opinions; any exhibits to be \nused as a summary of or support for the opinions; the qualifications of the \nwitness, including a list of all publications authored by the witness within the \npreceding ten years; the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony, and \na listing of any other cases in which the witness has testified as an expert at trial \nor by deposition with the preceding four years. \nSanctions for failure to provide disclosure of experts under Rule 26 is governed by Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 37(c)(l), which states: \nA party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information \nrequired by Rule 26(a) or 26(e)(l), or to amend a prior response to discovery as \nrequired by 26(e)(2), is not, unless such failure is harmless, permitted to use as \nevidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion any witness or information not so \ndisclosed. In addition to or in lieu of this sanction, the court, on motion and after \naffording an opportunity to be heard, may impose other appropriate sanctions. In \naddition to requiring payment of reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, \ncaused by the failure, these sanctions may include any of the sanctions \nauthorized under Rule 37(b)(2)(A), (B), and (C) and may include informing the \njury of the failure to make the disclosure. \nPlaintiffs’ initial expert disclosure clearly does not comply with the strict requirements of \nRule 26(a)(2)(B). The report provides only the most general and conclusory information, stating \nthat “Mr. Rosazza will testify that there are various violations of not only the Franklin County \nJail policy and procedure, federal and state law, including basic civil rights,” and that “Mr. \nRosazza will include a comprehensive statement of the case as well as specific opinions and the \nbasis for his opinions.”  The deficiencies of the report are Substantial. \nFirst, the report fails to explain how the expert reached his conclusion that violations of law \nhave occurred. Second, none of the parties are identified in the report.  It is difficult to \nunderstand how such a report could in any way inform the course of the defendants’ subsequent \n4 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 5 of 13(cid:10)\ndeposition of the expert. Finally, the report expressly states that a comprehensive statement of the \ncase will be forthcoming. However, the place for such a statement lies in the report itself. While \nRule 26 permits supplementation of initial disclosures, such disclosures are intended to correct or \ncomplete an already satisfactory report, not bolster a facially deficient one.  For these reasons, \nplaintiffs’ initial expert disclosure report is unsatisfactory. \nThe plaintiffs filed a supplemental report on November 9,2006 as an attachment to their \nresponse to defendants’ motion to strike. In a reply in support of the motion to strike, the \ndefendants complain that the supplemental report is both untimely and fails to comply with Rule \n26(a)(2)(B).  With respect to timeliness, the court’s order of September 8,2006 granted plaintiffs \nan extension of their deadline to submit expert disclosures until October 2,2006, but warned that \nabsent a strong showing by affidavit, no further extensions would be granted. \nNoting the court’s admonition that further extensions of discovery deadlines would be \ndenied absent a strong showing of good cause, defendants argue that the supplemental report is \nuntimely because plaintiffs failed to seek an extension or to provide good cause to extend the \nOctober deadline. Therefore, defendants urge this court to strike plaintiffs’ expert. \nAlthough the court concurs with defendants’ assessment of plaintiffs’ supplemental \nreport as deficient under Rule 26(a)(2), I decline to strike plaintiffs’ expert as untimely. \nPlaintiffs’ original report was timely, despite its serious deficiencies. In this case the court will \nconstrue the supplemental report as relating back to the timely submitted original report. \nThe supplemental report indicates that the plaintiffs’ expert has been “provided with a \nnumber of. . . allegations of illegal strip andor body cavity searches which on their face would \nnot meet the requirements of the FCJ policy, would be a violation of commonly accepted \n5 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 6 of 13(cid:10)\nstandards and practices in the industry, and would be violations of constitutional standards.” \nHowever, the report fails to explain what those standards are, or to relate them to any specific \nallegations. Nevertheless, the supplemental report exhibits at least a good faith effort to comply \nwith the requirements of Rule 26 such that striking the plaintiffs’ expert would be an unduly \nharsh penalty. \nNone of the authorities cited by defendants require the imposition of the requested \npenalty as a sanction under Rule 37.l  For example, in Smith v. Botsford Gen. Hosp., 41 9 F.3d \n513 (6th Cir. 2005), the trial court struck the testimony of an expert medical witness for failing \ndisclose ex parte communications with the decedent’s relative regarding his condition and \nsymptoms. Id. at 516. The Sixth Circuit affirmed on appeal, noting that “Rule 37 \nauthorizes-indeed,  directs-exclusion  of the witness as a sanction for a Rule 26 violation.” Id. \nat 5 17. Although the defendants make much of the word “directs” in this context, closer reading \nof the opinion clarifies the Sixth Circuit’s affirmation of the lower court’s discretion to “impose \nless stringent sanction than mandatory preclusion.” This view is bolstered by the appellate \ncourt’s citation to other cases emphasizing that “‘because the district court is in the best position \nto determine whether a party has complied with discovely orders, its discretion is especially \nbroad.”’ Id. (quotingAmes v.  Vun Dyne, 100 F.3d 956 (Table), 1996 WL 662899 at *4 (6th Cir. \n1996)); see also Roberts ex. rel. Johnson v. Galen of Va., Inc., 325 F.3d 776 (6th Cir. 2002)(no \nabuse of discretion for failing to exclude expert who failed to file report). \nAlthough a greater sanction would be warranted if the failure to disclose were discovered \nIn addition to the cases discussed, the defendants cited Smith v. State Farm Fire & \nCasualty Co., 164 F.R.D. 49 (S.D.W.V. 1995). While the Smith court found certain expert \ndisclosures to be inadequate, the court merely granted the opposing party’s motion to compel. \n6 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 7 of 13(cid:10)\non the eve of trial, in this case the harsh sanction of exclusion is not appropriate.  Instead, the \ncourt will direct plaintiffs to further supplement their report, and impose a small monetary \nsanction. \n3.  Defendants’ Motion for Sanctions [DE #80] \nDefendants have also moved for sanctions pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 37(b) based upon \nthe alleged failure of certain plaintiffs to comply with this court’s order of September 8,2006. In \nthat order, the court granted defendants’ prior motion to compel discovery, directing plaintiffs to \nserve their responses by October 1,2006. Plaintiffs were explicitly warned that a failure to \ntimely submit the discovery responses could result in sanctions under Fed. R. Civ. P 37. The \ndefendants now seek dismissal of the claims asserted by eleven plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs offer several \nexplanations for their non-compliance. \nPlaintiffs’ counsel state that they have been unable to reach Mr. Curtis, Ms. Nesselrode, \nMs. Baker, Mr. Farler, Mr. Bixler, and Ms. Cornn, despite repeated attempts.  Each owes \nresponses to the defendants’ written interrogatories and requests for document production. No \nexplanation has been provided for their failure to respond other than an apparent breakdown in \ncommunication between plaintiffs and their attorneys. \nAs to Ms. Creech, Ms. McClease, Mr. McClease, and Mr. Hockensmith, plaintiffs’ \ncounsel contends that they cannot produce documents which are not in their possession. \nHowever, plaintiffs have failed to respond to the requests with any information concerning their \npossession or non-possession of the requested documents. Defendants further assert that these \nplaintiffs have failed to answer certain written interrogatories. \nUnlike other plaintiffs, Ms. Cooper has responded to defendants’ discovery requests. \n7 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 8 of 13(cid:10)\nDefendants’ only complaint is that her signature does not appear on her answers to \ninterrogatories. Plaintiffs’ counsel represents that Ms. Cooper is currently incarcerated and that \nshe will sign and verify her responses at the earliest possible time.  Likewise, Ms. Black, Ms. \nHockensmith, and Ms. Epling have all complied with the defendants’ discovery requests. \nIn considering the appropriate sanctions for failure to provide responses to discovery \nrequests under court order, the Court is guided by Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2), which provides in \nrelevant part: \nIf a party . . . fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an \norder made under subdivision (a) of this rule . . . the court in which the action is \npending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among \nother the following: \n(A) An order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other \ndesignated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in \naccordance the claim of the party obtaining the order; \n(B) An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose \ndesignated claims or defenses, or prohibiting that party form introducing \ndesignated matters in evidence; \n(C) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further \nproceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action or proceeding or \nany part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient \nparty; \n... \nIn lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the court shall \nrequire the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or \nboth to the pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by the \nfailure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that \nother circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. \nA district court has broad discretion in determining the appropriate sanction for a party \nwho has violated the court’s discovery order.  See Phillips v. Cohen, 400 F.3d 388,402 (6thC  ir. \n2005) (“The choice of what sanction to impose is vested in the court’s discretion.”); 8A Charles \n8 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 9 of 13(cid:10)\nAlan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure 3 2284 \n(2006) (“The district court may, within reason, use as many and as varied sanctions as are \nnecessary to hold the scales of justice even.”). \nNo just reason has been provided for the failure of the first group of plaintiffs to adhere \nto the court’s discovery order.  Although the extreme sanction of dismissal is not warranted at \nthis time, the court will award defendants their reasonable attorney’s fees in making the motion \nas a sanction for plaintiffs’ past non-compliance. Should plaintiffs fail again to comply with this \norder, the court will consider additional sanctions including but not limited to dismissal. \nThe court will direct the second group of plaintiffs to more fully respond to the \noutstanding discovery requests without imposing sanctions at this time.  Similarly, the court will \ndirect Ms. Cooper to sign and verify her responses as soon as possible, on a date not to exceed \nsixty (60) days from the date of this order. Any future failure to comply with this order by the \nsecond group of plaintiffs or by Ms. Cooper will almost certainly result in sanctions. \n4. Plaintiffs’ Motion to Extend Time To Certify Class [DE #90] \nThe amended complaint contains allegations which relate to plaintiffs’ intent to seek \nclass certification. Early in this litigation plaintiffs agreed to withdraw a motion to certify a class \npending an initial period of discovery. Now, some twenty-one months after the initiation of this \nlitigation, plaintiffs have yet to re-file a motion to certify a class. The court’s September 28, \n2006 Opinion denied defendants’ motion to strike all class action allegations from plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint, but directed plaintiffs to file a motion to certify promptly or face the striking of their \nclass allegations. \n9 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 10 of 13(cid:10)\nBecause the Court is unable to determine whether this action meets the \nrequirements of Rule 23 on the existing record, the Court will permit discovery to \nproceed before striking the class allegations from the Complaint. .. .. \nThe Court will, however, require that any Motion for Class Certification be file \nwithin 60 days of the entry date of this Opinion and Order. Failure to file any \nsuch motion will result in the striking of the class allegations from the complaint. \nDE #72 at p. 4. \nOn the date they were required to file their motion, plaintiffs instead moved for an \nextension of time in which to file their motion to certify a class. Plaintiffs seek an additional \nsixty days in which to file their motion “due to the state of discovery” including the overall \ndiscovery deadline of February 28, 2007. Plaintiffs argue specifically that they need further \ndiscovery “to show what point the searches have occurred in the process of \nbooking/arraigmnents, etc.,” and “on the application by the jail personnel of their own policies.” \nHowever, plaintiffs have been aware of the sixty-day deadline in which to gather any necessary \ndiscovery since September 28.  In addition, the order extending the overall discovery deadline to \nFebruary was set prior to the court’s September 28 order directing plaintiffs to file their class \ncertification motion within sixty days. Clearly, the court intended for plaintiffs to complete any \ndiscovery necessary to file the class certification motion at the outset of the discovery period. \nHowever, defendants point out that the only deposition requested by plaintiff in the last sixty \ndays has been a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of a representative most knowledgeable on the FCCC’s \npolicies and procedures, which deposition was recently cancelled by plaintiff due to a conflict. \nThe only outstanding paper discovery referenced by plaintiffs was the subject of a motion to \ncompel w-hich was denied by this court in its September 28 order. \n10 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 11 of 13(cid:10)\nRule 23 requires that class certification “shall” be decided “as soon as practicable” after \nthe commencement of an action, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(l), a fact recognized by the court in \nsetting the prior deadline. As stated, this litigation is now more than 21 months old. \nPlaintiffs argue that it would be inappropriate to rule on class certification before \nadditional plaintiffs are added by the proposed second amended complaint.  However, if a class is \ncertified, an unknown number of plaintiffs may be added. The addition of plaintiffs in the \nsecond amended complaint as potential class representatives does not preclude a decision on the \npropriety of a class under Rule 23. \nFinally, plaintiffs’ counsel represents that the sheer volume of material in this litigation \n“has prompted the undersigned counsel to consider whether our office is equipped to handle class \naction litigation, with appropriate notification to class members, etc.”  Counsel also seeks \nadditional time “to consult possible substitute counsel for that purpose.”  Again, the court can \nonly note that plaintiffs’ counsel have had more than twenty-one months - presumably including \nprior to the filing of the complaint - to determine whether counsel is equipped to handle class \naction litigation. Counsel have not demonstrated good cause for a further extension. \nDespite the lack of good cause shown, the court will in the interest of justice permit \nplaintiffs a brief extension of time in which to file their motion for class certification before \nimposing the harsh penalty of striking plaintiffs’ allegations. Although only the briefest \nextensions is warranted, due to the briefing schedule of the plaintiffs’ motion itself as well as the \ntiming of the entry of this order, the extension will result in plaintiffs having a full sixty days \nbeyond the expiration of their original November 27 deadline. \n11 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 12 of 13(cid:10)\n5.  Defendants’ Motion to Extend Time To Produce Expert Information [DE #91] \nDefendants seek to extend time to produce expert information on the new plaintiffs added \nin the second amended complaint. The extension is limited to the disclosure of Rule 26 \ninformation pertaining to the newly proposed plaintiffs. No opposition being heard and for good \ncause shown, it will be granted. \nConclusion \nThe Court having reviewed the pending motions, IT IS ORDERED: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint [D.E. #76] is granted, the court \nhaving already received plaintiffs’ second amended complaint, and the amended complaint shall \nbe filed of record; \n2.  Defendants’ motion to strike the plaintiffs’ expert [D.E. #79] is denied; \n3.  Plaintiffs shall within fifteen (1 5) days from the date of entry of this order provide \na revised expert disclosure report that more fully complies with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B) as \ndiscussed in this order.  Failure to do so may subject plaintiffs to additional sanctions under Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 37(c)(l), including precluding the expert Witness from testifying at trial; \n4.  Upon motion, defendants may extend the deadline for disclosure of their own \nexpert witness(es) until sixty (60) days after final submission of the plaintiffs’ expert report. \n5.  The defendants’ motion for sanctions [DE #&O] is granted in part and denied in \npart as follows: \na. Plaintiffs shall pay to defendants the sum of $500.00 as a monetary sanction based \nupon the fees expended by defendants in filing the motion to strike plaintiffs’ deficient expert \nreport, and defendants’ motion for discovery sanctions. \n12 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 96     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 13 of 13(cid:10)\nb.  Within ten (1 0) days of the date of this order, all plaintiffs shall fully comply with this \ncourt’s September 8,2006 order as more fully detailed in the body of this Memorandum Order. \nAny plaintiff who fails to fully comply with this order may be subject to dismissal, the court \nhaving twice directed plaintiffs to respond to discovery and having imposed in this order a lesser \nmonetary sanction for their prior noncompliance. \n6. Plaintiffs’ motion to extend time to certify a class [DE #90] is granted in part. \nPlaintiffs shall file any such motion not later than January 26,2007. NO FURTHER \nEXTENSIONS WILL BE GRANTED. A failure to timely file a motion to certify will result in \nthe class allegations being stricken from the complaint; \n7. Defendants’ motion for an extension of time in which to identify experts on the newly \nadded plaintiffs [DE #91] is granted. \nThis 29thd ay of December, 2006. \nSigned By:  1 &u \nJ.

See 28 U.S.C. §636(b). \nAs indicated in the Memorandum Order, the defendants’ motion has been to denied as to certain\nplaintiffs, but is appropriate as to plaintiffs Jillian Baker and Darren Dean Hockensmith for\nfailure to prosecute, failure to participate in discovery, and failure to comply with the prior\ndiscovery orders of this court.\nDismissal is a sanction which should be used \"if the Court concludes that the party's\nfailure to cooperate in discovery was willful, in bad faith, or due to its own fault.\"  Beil v.\nLakewood Engineering & Mf'g Co., 15 F.3d 546, 552 (6th Cir. 1994).  \"If a party has the ability\nto comply with a discovery order and does not, dismissal is not an abuse of discretion.\" \nRegional Refuse Systems, Inc. v. Inland Reclamation Co., 842 F.2d 150, 154 (6th Cir. 1988).  See\nalso Bass v. Jostens, Inc., 71 F.3d 237 (6th Cir. 1995); Bank One of Cleveland, N.A. v. Abbe, 916\nF.2d 1067 (6th Cir. 1990).\n1\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 132     Filed 03/26/2007     Page 2 of 3(cid:10)\nWhile dismissal is obviously the harshest sanction which can be imposed for discovery\nabuses, it is warranted in some cases.  However, dismissal under either Rule 37 or Rule 41(b)\nshould be imposed only after consideration of the following factors: (1) whether the party’s\nfailure to cooperate is due to willfulness, bad faith, or fault; (2) whether the adversary was\nprejudiced by the dilatory conduct of the party; (3) whether the dismissed party was warned that\nfailure to cooperate could lead to dismissal; and (4) whether less drastic sanctions were imposed\nor considered before dismissal was ordered.  See Regional Refuse System, Inc. v. Inland\nReclamation Co. 842 F.2d at 153-55.\nIn this case, all factors favor the dismissal of the two identified plaintiffs’ claims.  The\nplaintiffs’ repeated failure to respond to legitimate discovery requests violated the Civil Rules of\nProcedure and this court’s prior orders of September 8 and December 29, 2006, and can only be\nviewed as deliberate.  The defendants have been prejudiced by their inability to obtain discovery\nwithin the time frame mandated by this court and by being put to additional expense of filing\nrepeated motions.  The plaintiffs have had sufficient notice of the possibility of dismissal based\nupon their failure to respond to defendants’ discovery requests.  Not only did this court\npreviously order plaintiffs to respond, but in its order of December 29, 2006 the court\nspecifically warned plaintiffs that dismissal would be recommended should they continue to fail\nto respond. See Harmon v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 110 F.3d 364, 368 (6th Cir. 1997)(flatly\nrejecting any argument that the plaintiff lacked notice that the district court was contemplating\ndismissal, in light of the fact that the defendant had filed a motion to dismiss); Regional Refuse\nSystems,Inc.,842 F.2d at 154 (same).   Lesser sanctions were explicitly considered and imposed\nin the court’s previous order and plaintiffs were permitted time to “show cause” for their failure\n2\n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 132     Filed 03/26/2007     Page 3 of 3(cid:10)\nto respond.  Monetary sanctions are no longer a realistic alternative given plaintiffs’ complete\nfailure to participate in the discovery process and the lack of any legitimate justification for their\nrepeated failures to do so.\nACCORDINGLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT the defendants’ motion to dismiss\nthe claims of identified plaintiffs [DE #102] be granted in part and that the claims of Jillian\nBaker and Darren Dean Hockensmith be dismissed with prejudice for failure to prosecute,\nfailure to respond to discovery, and failure to comply with this court’s September 8 and\nDecember 29, 2006 orders.\nOBJECTIONS to this report and recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Court\nwithin ten (10) days of the date of service of the same or further appeal is waived.

However, because the complaints allege minor, \ndismissal of Plaintiff Karen Gamble’s (“Gamble”) and  nonviolent  offenses  and  no  reasonable  suspicion  of \nPlaintiff  Davanika  Barber’s  (“Barber”)  claims  against  contraband or weapons, the Court cannot conclude at this \nthem.  First,  any  attempt  by  Plaintiffs  to  argue  that  point that the remaining Plaintiffs cannot recover under \nGamble’s claim falls under the protection of Masters is  any  set  of  facts  consistent  with  their  allegations.

The Court finds that a \nstrip  search  in  these  situations  does  not  violate  an \nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED: \nindividual’s  constitutional  rights.

However, Defendants rely on a substantial amount of evidence to support many of their \narguments, which would result in the Court having to reserve ruling on numerous claims-the details of which the Court addresses \nlater in this Memorandum Opinion and Order. In light of this and because no discovery has yet been conducted, in the Court’s \nview, it would be more efficient and more in keeping with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to treat this motion as a facial \nattack on Plaintiff’s claims; deny the motion to the extent that it necessarily relies on extrinsic evidence; and allow Defendants the \nopportunity, after some time is allowed for discovery, to re-raise any of their arguments that necessarily relied on evidence outside \nthe pleadings. \n \n2  In response to Defendants’ argument on the physical injury requirement, Plaintiffs merely state: \nIt is clear beyond any doubt that the illegal strip searches employed by Defendants in these cases violated the Plaintiffs’ \n \nconstitutional rights. The allegation that this clearly unconstitutional conduct also caused embarrassment, humiliation and \nemotional distress does not eliminate the cause of action for Defendants’ conduct. Defendants’ conduct was actionable even \nwithout the allegation of embarrassment, humiliation and emotional distress. \n(Pls.’ Resp. to Defs’ Mot. to Dismiss First Am. Compl. at 15.) However, Plaintiffs offer no authority whatsoever for this \nseemingly conclusory argument that the physical injury requirement in § 1997e(e) does not apply in this case. \n \n3  Defendants correctly point out that they have not conceded that they actually violated Plaintiff Black’s equal protection right. The \nonly thing that Defendants have conceded is that Black’s claim, if true, constitutes an equal protection claim. Thus, at the motion to \n \ndismiss stage, such claim is not subject to dismissal. \n \n4  In response to Defendants’ argument on this issue, Plaintiff merely states, “The fundamental rights under the ‘penumbra doctrine’ \nrecognized in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) involves the right to privacy and is \n \nclearly established. Defendants thus are not entitled to qualified immunity on the Ninth Amendment claim.” (Pls.’ Resp. to Defs’ \nMot. to Dismiss First Am. Compl. at 13.) This wholly conclusory statement hardly establishes that Plaintiffs have alleged Ninth \nAmendment violations and certainly fails to show that any such Ninth Amendment right was “clearly established.” \n \n5  Defendants argue that numerous other Plaintiffs were strip searched only after returning from court and, thus, after having been \nexposed to the public. However, other than those Plaintiffs who the Court addressed above, all of Defendants’ argument \n \nnecessarily require the Court to consider evidence outside the pleadings, which the Court declines to do. Defendants may re-raise \nthese arguments, though, after Plaintiffs have been allowed time to conduct a sufficient amount of discovery to rebut Defendants’ \narguments. \n \n6  Defendant also argues that Plaintiff Brittney Creech (“Creech”) was charged with drug crimes and that her claim must be \ndismissed. However, in so arguing, Defendants necessarily rely on evidence outside the pleadings, which this Court disregards for \n \npurposes of this motion. Therefore, the Court will not at this point dismiss Creech’s claims on those grounds. \n  7 \n \n\nBlack v. Franklin County, Kentucky, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2005)   \n \n \n7  Plaintiff cites several decisions from other districts wherein courts held strip searches to be unconstitutional despite the plaintiff \nhaving been brought in on drug charges. However, the Court is of the opinion that cases from other circuits, i.e., non-controlling \n \ncase law, would not put Defendants on notice that the strip search at issue violated Plaintiff Mitchell’s constitutional rights. Thus, \neven if the Court agreed with the cases to which Plaintiff Mitchell cites and adopted their holdings, which the Court does not, such \ncases would not have been controlling in this district at the time of the alleged acts. Therefore, Defendants would be entitled to \nqualified immunity with respect to Mitchell’s claims. \n \n8  Moreover, as Defendants point out, an inmate, such as Gamble or Barber, is not entitled to the same privacy rights as \nunincarcerated persons or even pretrial detainees. Cf. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 522-26, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 \n \n(1984)(“[W]e hold that society is not prepared to recognize as legitimate any subjective expectation of privacy that a prisoner \nmight have in his prison cell and that, accordingly, the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not \napply within the confines of the prison cell.”). \n \n9  The Court recognizes that under some circumstances it would be appropriate to find that, despite Plaintiff having alleged a \nconstitutional violation, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. However, this is not one such case. Because the law at issue \n \nis clearly established and is directly on point with the allegations, Masters, 872 F.2d at 1255, if Defendants violated such law by \nstrip searching Plaintiff in violation of Masters, then Defendants would not be entitled to qualified immunity. See Brosseau, 125 \nS.Ct. at 599; Lyons, slip op. at 10. Because the Court finds that there is a set of facts that Plaintiff Black could prove consistent \nwith the allegations of the complaint that would entitle her to relief, and because such law is clearly established, Defendants are not \nat this point entitled to qualified immunity. \n \n10  Specifically, the relevant Plaintiffs and the crimes with which they were charged are as follows: Creech-driving under the \ninfluence; Jeffrey Curtis (“Curtis”)-contempt of court for failure to pay fines and failure to attend classes; Angela Nesselrode \n \n(“Nesselrode”)-contempt of court for failure to pay fines and failure to appear; Tommy Cummins (“Cummins”)-contempt for \nfailure  to  pay  fines;  Jillian  Baker  (“Baker”)-contempt  for  failure  to  pay  fines  and  failure  to  appear;  Linda  Epling \n(“Epling”)-violation of probation for failure to maintain automobile insurance; Joe Farler (“Farler”)-contempt of court and/or \nalcohol intoxication; Natalie Elizabeth McClease (“N.McCLease”)-unlawful transaction with a minor as a result of truancy; Tony \nRay McClease (“T.McClease”)-unlawful transaction with a minor as a result of truancy; Jonathan Cox (“Cox”)-operating a motor \nvehicle on a suspended license; Cooper-contempt of court on underlying convictions of driving on a suspended license and driving \nunder the influence; and Julie Ann Corn (“Corn”)-misdemeanor theft by unlawful taking. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  8 \n ",

This action is brought, pursuant to FRCP 23, and other applicable law, by \nPlaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated whose joinder \nin this  action is impracticable because the  class is  so  numerous that joinder of  all \nmembers is impracticable. \n32.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, all as set forth \nhereinbelow. \n33.  The claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims ofthe \nclass \nPage 6 of 31 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 11     Filed 05/09/2005     Page 7 of 31(cid:10)\n34.  The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the class. \nK  NATURE OF DEFENDANT’S CONDUCT \n35.  Defendants, individually and in conspiracy with one another, engaged in \nthe conduct described below under color of the law of the Commonwealth of Kentucky \nand Franklin County.  The individual Defendants named above knowingly participated or \nacquiesced in,  contributed to,  encouraged, implicitly authorized or  approved of the \nccjnduct  described  below  individually  and  in  their  official  capacities with  Franklin \nCounty and/or the Franklin County Correctional Complex.  The offenses described below \nresulted  from the failure of Defendants to employ qualified persons for positions of \nauthority, and/or to properly or conscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such \npersons after their employment, and/or to promulgate appropriate operating policies and \nprocedures either formally or by custom to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens \nof the  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky,  including Plaintiffs.  Defendants’  conduct was \nintentional or grossly negligent, indicated active malice toward Plaintiffs or a total and \nreckless disregard for and indifference to each of their constitutional and common law \nrights, and justifies an award of punitive damages in  addition to the actual damages \nwhich the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover. \nm. \nFACTS \n36.  There are questions of  law  and  fact  common to the  class.  Plaintiffs \nreiterate each and every allegation contained in the original Complaint fled herein,  and \nmore specifically, those allegations contained in numerical paragraphs 14,15, and 16. \nPage 7of 31 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 11     Filed 05/09/2005     Page 8 of 31(cid:10)\nI \n37.  With respect to the facts, on  January 28,  2005, Jefiey Curtis, was \narrested in Franklin County, Kentucky, after having been found in contempt of court by \nthe Franklin District  Court  for failure to pay  fines,  and  failure to attend  classes at \nKentucky Alternatives Program.  Plaintiff was then transported to the Franklin County \nCorrectional Complex where he was subjected to a  strip search when there was no \nreasonable cause to believe that he was carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. \nSpecifically,  Plaintiff  was  required  by  a  Franklin  County  Correctional  Complex \nemployee to remove all of his clothing, so that a visual inspection of his person could be \naccomplished.  Plaints Curtis was not strip searched initially when brought into the jail, \nbut was strip searched several days after his initial incarceration. \n38.  Plaintiff, Wendy Hockensmith, on June 28,2004, was arrested in Franklin \nCounty, Kentucky, and charged with improper use of electronic equipment, which charge \nwas ultimately dismissed.  After Plaintiff was taken into custody by  police,  she was \ntransported to the Franklin County Correctional Complex where she was subjected to a \nstrip search when there was no reasonable cause to believe that she was carrying or \nconcealing weapons or contraband.  Specifically, Plaintiff was required by  a Franklin \nCounty Correctional Complex employee to remove all of her clothing, so that a visual \ninspection of her person could be accomplished.  Plaintiff Hockensmith was required to \nspread her legs, stoop, and cough vigorously, all under the direct visual observation of a \njail employee. \n39.  Plaintiff, Deidra Wash, was charged with driving under the influence of \nalcohol, third offense, in Franklin County, Kentucky.  Plaintiff was incarcerated in the \nFranklin County Correctional Complex.  Initially, Plaintiff was not strip searched.  It was \nPage8of 31 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 11     Filed 05/09/2005     Page 9 of 31(cid:10)\nnot until several days later, on or about February 8, 2005, after having been taken to \nCourt for a hearing on her case, that Plaintiff was strip searched by  the jail official, \nhaving been required to remove all of her clothing under the visual inspection of a jail \nemployee.  At the time when Plaintiff was strip searched, there was no reasonable cause \nto believe that she was carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. \n40.  Plaintiff,  Rebecca  Hagan,  on  March  27,  2004,  was  charged  with \npossession  of drug  paraphernalia,  operating a  motor vehicle under the  innuence of \nh€oXicants, and possession of marijuana, in Anderson County, Kentucky.  Those charges \nare still pending.  Plaintiff Hagan was taken into custody by Lawrenceburg Police, and \nlater transported to the Franklin County Correctional Complex where she was subjected \nto a strip search when there was no reasonable cause to believe that she was canying or \nconcealing weapons or contraband.  Specifically,  Plaintiff was required by a Franklin \nCounty Correctional Complex employee to remove all of her clothing, so that a visual \ninspection of her person could be accomplished.  Plaintif€ Hagan was required to spread \nher legs,  stoop, and cough vigorously, all under the direct visual observation of a jail \nemployee. \n41.  Plaintiff, Karen  Gamble, was  charged in  Anderson County,  Kentucky, \nwith Assault IV.  As a result of a plea agreement entered by her with the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky, Plaintiff was required to serve 2 days in the Franklin County Correctional \nComplex. Plaintiffreported for service of her sentence on October 27, 2004, at 600 p.m. \nat the Frankliin County Correctional Complex.  After arrival, Plaintiff was instructed to \ngo into a  room where there was a shower, a shelfunit with clothes and bins of flip flops. \nPlaint8 was told by a jail employee to strip off all of her clothing, including all under \nPage 9 of 31 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 11     Filed 05/09/2005     Page 10 of 31(cid:10)\ngarments.  Plaintiffasked, but was refused, to be allowed to wear her under garments. \nPlaintiff was made to stand in fiont of the jail employee naked, raise her arms, then bend \nover and shake her hands through her hair.  Plaints was made to open her mouth and \nraise her tongue.  After this, Plaintiff was instructed to turn around, facing away fiom the \nguard, bend over and spread her buttocks open for the guard to see inside her rectal area. \nThere was no reasonable cause to believe  that Plaints was  carrying  or  concealing \nweapons or contraband. \n42.

The Plaintiff was \ninformed by the guard that the jail personnel has the right to “strip search anybody we \nwant, anytime we want to.”  Plaintiff Farler was subjected to a strip search when there \nwas  no  reasonable  cause to believe  that  he  was  carrying or concealing weapons  or \ncontraband. \n50.

In 1979, the United States Supreme Court held that a pretrial detainee has \nthe right not to be searched unless the reasonableness of such search is established by \n“balancing ..  .the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that \nthe search entails.  On April  18,  1989, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its \nopinion in Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6* Cir 1989), cert.denied, 493 U.S. 977, \nIf0 S.Ct. 503 (1989), inwhichit held: \nIt was clearly established on October 21, 1986, that a pretrial detainee has \nthe right not to be searched unless the reasonableness of such search is \nestablished by “a balancing of the need for the particular search against \nthe  invasion  of  personal  rights  that  the  search  entails.”  (Citations \nomitted).  It was equally clearly established that a person charged only \nwith a t r a c  violation or nonviolent minor offense may not be subjected \nto a strip search unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the \nparticular  person  might  be  carrying or concealing weapons  or  other \ncontraband. \n-Id.  At  1257 (Emphasis in original).  Masters specifically involved the strip-search of a \nperson arrested for a nonviolent minor offense by the Jefferson County Department of \nCorrections. In this case, Plaintiffs were arrested for nonviolent minor offenses.  Neither \ntheir  behavior  nor  their  appearance gave  Defendants  any  reasonable  grounds  for \nbelieving that they might be carrying or concealing weapons or other contraband. Under \nsuch circumstances, Defendants’ requirement that Plaintiffs expose the most private part \nof their physical person for a visual inspection was unconscionable, was an illegal strip- \nsearch by  any definition, and was a flagrant violation of the balancing requirement of \nBell v. Wolfish,  .-\nPage 18 of 31 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 11     Filed 05/09/2005     Page 19 of 31(cid:10)\n,  ‘ .  \nWL CAUSES OF ACTION \nA.  CountI \n62.  Paragraphs 1-61 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 62. \n63.  Plaintiffs’ search, described above, was part of a continuing pattern of \nmisconduct  and is the result of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, procedures, \ncustoms and practices of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Franklin County, either \nwiitten or unwritten, that are systematically applied whenever an arrestee is admitted to \nthe Franklin County Correctional Complex. A judgment was recently entered against the \nDefendants for similar misconduct and the Defendants continue to perform illegal strip- \nsearches.  Such practices constitute an arbitrary use of government power, and evince a \ntotal,  intentional and  unreasonable disregard for the constitutional and  common law \nrights of the citizens of Kentucky, including Plaintiffs and the wholesale violations of \nthose rights likely to result from the systematic pursuit of such practices. \n64.  As the result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs, through Defendants’ intentional \nor grossly negligent conduct, were deprived without due process of law of the following \nrights, privileges and immunities guaranteed to each of them by the Constitution of the \nUnited States in violation ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983: \n(a)  Their right to be secure in their persons against \nunreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments; \n(b)  Their right to privacy in their persons against \nunreasonable intrusions under the Fourth, Fifth, \nNinth and Fourteenth Amendments; \nPage 19 of 31 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 11     Filed 05/09/2005     Page 20 of 31(cid:10)\n(c)  Their right to the equal protection of the law secured \nby the Fourteenth Amendment; and \n(d)  Their right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual \npunishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments. \n65.  Moreover, given the preexisting law that clearly prohibited Defendants’ \nconduct and the recent entry of a judgment against these same Defendants for this same \nconduct, Defendants search of PlaintiEs was intentional, wanton and malicious, and was \nindicative of Defendants’ total and reckless disregard of, indflerence to the rights of, and \nrisk of harm to, Plaintiffs. \nB.  CountII \n66.  Paragraphs 1-65 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 66. \n67.  By  virtue  of  the  foregoing,  Defendants intentionally  and  unjustifiably \ninflicted upon Plaintiffs severe mental and emotional distress. \nC. Count IU \n68.  . Paragraphs 1-67 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 68 \n69.  By  virtue  of  the  foregoing,  Defendants  were  negligent,  and  grossly \nnegligent, all to the damage of Plaintiffs. \nWIL DAMAGES \n70.  Paragraphs 1-69 above are incorporated herein by reference and made this \nParagraph 70. \nPage 20 of  31 \n\nCase 3:05-cv-00018-KKC     Document 11     Filed 05/09/2005     Page 21 of 31(cid:10)\n71.  Plaintiffs were unjustitiably and unconstitutionally searched in  a manner \nthat generated tremendous and overwhelming embarrassment, humiliation and  mental \nand emotional distress.  As a result, Plaintiffs have suffered, and are entitled to recover, \nactual damages.  Furthermore, Defendants' violations of the constitutional and common \nlaw rights of Plaintiffs were cruel, malicious, and evinced a total and reckless disregard \nfor and indifference to those rights, entitling Plaintiffs to recover punitive damages from \nDefendants in order to deter such conduct in the fiture. \n- \nAK  DECZARATORYJUDGiKWTAND PERMANEhTINJUNCTION \n72.
