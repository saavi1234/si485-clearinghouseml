Our information on this case is limited to the entries on the PACER docket.</p><p>On November 10, 1997, the District Court (Judge Joseph M. Hood) certified the case as a class action. As 68 of the potential class members were identified as juveniles, the Court established special handling procedures for their claims, including ordering that their booking records be placed under seal.</p><p>Discovery and settlement talks continued through 1998 and 1999.  In early 1999, the Court bifurcated the issues of liability and damages and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  By order dated April 6, 1999, the District Court (Judge Hood) entered summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants.  Shortly thereafter, settlement talks resumed and the case was ultimately settled.</p><p>The parties' Joint Stipulation of Settlement was preliminarily approved by the District Court (Judge Hood) on December 28, 1999 and the case was set for a fairness hearing, after which the settlement was formally approved.  The District Court appointed a guardian ad litem on behalf of the potential claimants who were identified as juveniles.  The terms of the settlement were not recorded in the docket entries and are therefore unknown.</p>",
