      "title": "Defendants' Memorandum in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment",
      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\nAntonia DeToledo, and\nLiana Williams,\nPlaintiffs,\nV.\nCivil Action No. 03-CV-10834-RGS\nCounty of Suffolk, Lt. Angelo Rao,\nSgt. Janet Sinclair, Sgt.Owen Julius\nDpty. Sylvia Thomas,\nDefendants.\nDEFENDANTSโ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiffs Liana Williams and Antonia DeToledo filed suit against the County of Suffolk\nand John Doe in Suffolk Superior Court, Docket No.SUCV2001-01297 on or about June 13,\n2001. After a period of discovery, the Superior Court allowed the Plaintiffsโ Motion to Amend\ntheir complaint. The Amended Complaint added four Sheriffโ s Department employees and\nincluded counts under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983. Defendants removed the case to Federal Court. The\nPlaintiffsโ claims arise from incidents that occurred when they visited the Suffolk County House\nof Correction on July 26, 1998. The parties agreed to voluntarily dismiss Counts XIII through\nXVI against Defendant Owen Julius and Counts IX, XXI, XVII, and XIX claims of Plaintiff\nAntonia DeToledo against Defendants Sinclair and Thomas, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41\n(a)(l).\nThe remaining individual Defendants now state that there are no issues of material fact\nwith regard to the remaining claims against them and that they are entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law. The Counts addressed in the instant Motion include the State and Federal Claims\nof both Plaintiffs against Defendant Rao, and the State and Federal Claims of Williams against\nDefendants Sinclair and Thomas.\nII. FACTS\nDefendants rely on the Statement of Undisputed Material Facts submitted in conjunction\nwith the instant motion pursuant to Local Rule 56.1.\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nIn order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment, the moving party must show that\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact. See F~D. R. Cir. P. 56(c); Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n317 (1986). For purposes of Summary Judgment, an issue is genuine if \"the evidence is such\nthat a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty\nI~obbยฅ, Inc. 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A fact is material if it is one that has \"the potential to\naffect the outcome of the suit under applicable law. Nerieda-Gonzalez v. Yirado-Del~ardo, 990\nF.2d 701,703 (1~t Cir. 1993).\nAs the moving party on this motion for summary judgment, it is the Defendantsโ burden\nto show the absence of evidence to support the non-moving partyโs case. Garside v. Osco Drug,\nInc., 895 F.2d 46 (lst Cir. 1990). Thereafter, \"[a] party opposing summary judgment must\npresent definite, competent evidence to rebut the motion.\" Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-\nRodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (lst Cir. 1994), quoting Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d\n816, 822 (lst Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985 (1992). \"Brash conjecture, coupled with\nearnest hope that something concrete will eventually materialize, is insufficient to block\nsummary judgment.\" Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581, quoting Dow v. United Brotherhood of\nCarpenters, 1 F.3d 56, 58 (lst Cir. 1993). Moreover, merely discrediting the moving partyโs\n2\n\ntestimony is not normally sufficient to defeat the moverโs motion for summary judgment; instead,\nthe non-mover must submit affirmative evidence. First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities\nService Co., 391 U.S. 253 (1968).\nIV. ARGUMENT\n1. THE PLAINTIFFSโ COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM\nAGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, AS THERE WAS NO\nVIOLATION OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.\nThe Plaintiffs assert that their liberty interests were violated by the actions of the\nDefendants in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution. Defendant Rao made the determination to detain DeToledo and to arrest\nWilliams. Rao was the shift commander on duty and the other officers involved in the detention\nand arrest were acting pursuant to his commands. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment provides: \"[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property\nwithout due process of law.\" U.S. Const. Amend. XVI, ยง 1. Plaintiffs allege the actions of the\ncorrection officers in escorting them to another section of the House of Correction violated their\nconstitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. The Plaintiffs aver:\nOn or about July 26, 1998, the defendant interfered with the plaintiffโs right to be\nfree from excessive and/or unreasonable force and the plaintiffโs right to be free\nfrom deprivation of liberty without due process of law by physically removing\nplaintiff from the waiting area of the South Bay House of Corrections to a holding\ncell within the facility. (Complaint ~l ยถ 46, 50, 63, 67, 97, 101)\nThe Supreme Court has made abundantly clear that ยง1983 is not in itself a source of\nsubstantive right, but merely provides a method of vindicating federal rights elsewhere\nconferred. Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 393-94 (1989).\n\nTitle 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides in relevant part:\nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or\nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to\nbe subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the\njurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an\naction at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in\nany action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such\nofficerโs judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless declaratory\ndecree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\nAt the time of the incidents giving rise to the Complaint, the Defendants were acting\nunder color of law. Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff DeToledo was detained for about four\nminutes, and that Plaintiff Williams was placed under arrest. Both were subjected to a loss of\nliberty. However, the loss of liberty did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The Supreme Court addressed a sit~aation comparable to the instant case in Baker v.\nMcCotlan, 443 U.S. 137 (1979). The Plaintiff in Baker was arrested in error after his brother\nused his identity when arrested. Baker was held in custody for eight days despite his\nprotestations that he was not the person identified in the warrant. The Court found no\nConstitutional deprivation stating:\n\"Section 1983 imposes liability for violation of rights protected by the\nConstitution, not for violations of duties of care arising out of tort law. Remedy\nfor the latter type of injury must be sought in the state court under traditional tort-\nlaw principals. Just as medical \"malpractice does not become a constitutional\nviolation merely because the victim is a prisoner, Estelle v. (]amble, 429 U.S. 97,\n106, 97 S. Ct 285,292, 50 L. Ed 2d 251 (1976), false imprisonment does not\nbecome a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment merely because the defendant is\na state official.\" Id at 145.\nThe Court recognized that the Constitution does not guarantee that only the guilty will be\narrested. Baker, 433 U.S. at 145. The law is clearly established that an individual arrested by\nmistake based on a facially valid warrant has no (:laim under the Due Process Clause. Brady v.\nDill, 187 F.3d 104 (1st Cir. 1999).(No Due Proce,,;s violation where the plaintiff was arrested on\n4\n\nwarrant issued to another individual that used hiโ.s name.); Hill v. California, 40l U.S. 797, 1971\n(When police have probable cause to arrest the first party but reasonably mistake the second\nparty for the first party, arrest of the second partly is valid.)\nThe situation in the instant case differs in that it was discovered subsequent to the arrest\nthat the warrant was not a valid warrant. At the time the arrests were made, however, Rao\nbelieved the warrant to be an active warrant. There is nothing to suggest Rao was acting with any\nmalice or intent to cause harm to either Plaintiff: In addressing a Due Process claim of a\nprisoner, the Supreme Court stated:\nThe Due Process Clause was intended to secure an individual from an abuse of\npower by government officials. Far from an abuse of power, lack of due care,\nsuch as respondents alleged negligence here, suggests no more than failure to\nmeasure up to the conduct of a reasonable person. To hold that injury caused by\nsuch conduct a depriwttion within the meaning of the Due Process Clause would\ntrivialize the centuries-old principals of due process of law. Daniels v. Williams,\n474 U.S. 327, 328 (1986).\nRaoโs actions, although arguably negligent were not an \"abuse of power\" under the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nEvaluating Plaintiffsโ claims under cases that address warrant-less arrests, there still is no\nbasis for a deprivation of a constitutional fight. Probable cause is required to make an arrest.\nWong Sun v. United States. 3โ71 U.S. 471,479 (11963). Probable cause to arrest exists if at the\nmoment of the arrest, the fact~,; and circumstances within the relevant actorsโ knowledge and of\nwhich they had reasonably reliable information were adequate to warrant a prudent person in\nbelieving that the subject had iperpetrated or was poised to perpetrate an offense. Roche v. John\nHancock, 81 F. 3d 249, 354 (1st Cir. 1996), citing Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964). Further,\nthe inquiry into the existence of probable cause is not to be taken from the prospective of\nhindsight, but from the prospective of the reasonable man standing in the shoes of the individual\n\nwhen he made the decision to arrest. Id. Courts must ask whether a reasonable person would rely\non a particular piece of information, not whether the information was unquestionably accurate in\nmaking the probable cause deIermination. Roche, 81 F.3d at 255.\nIn Thompson v. Olson, 798 F.2d 552, (1~t Cir. 1986) a diabetic blind man was arrested\nbecause the arresting officers believed the man to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs and\nhe would not exit a bus upon request. His medical condition was not made known to the\narresting officers. The Appeals Court reversed the District Courtโs finding of a violation of\nยง 1983, opining that the conduct of the arresting officers did not \"shock\" the conscience, the\nstandard adopted by the Court in ruling on Due Process claims. Thompson, 798 F.2d at 554. The\nCourt found at most, the arresting officers conduct may rise to the level of negligence. Id. Mere\nnegligence does not trigger the protection of the Due Process Clause. Daniels v. Williams, 474\nU.S. 327, 328 (1986). Where a government officialโs causing injury to life, liberty or property is\nmerely negligence, \"no procedure for compensation is constitutionally required\" Daniels, 474\nU.S. at 333 citing Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 584 (1981).\nGovernment officials may be liable for conduct that reflects a reckless or callous\nindifference to an individualโs, rights. Germany ~,. Vance, 868 F. 2d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 1989). The\ncrux of the inquiry is the intel~tion of the actor. I f a person acts with the desire to cause harm or\nwith the belief that harm is cel~ain to result, the action is \"intentional\". Conversely, if the actor\nhas no such desire or belief, b~at acts unreasonable in light of the risks, his behavior is labeled\n\"negligent\" see Germany, 868 F.2d at 18, n. 10. Rao was neither callous nor indifferent with\nregard to his actions on July 26, 1998. His lack of callousness is evidenced by his acquiesces in\nWilliamsโ request not to be handcuffed in front of her children. Also, he was genuinely\napologetic to Williams when she returned to the House of Correction. The facts of Torres\n\nRamirez v. Bermudez Garcia, 898 F. 2d 224 (1~ Cir. 1990) are strikingly similar to what\ntranspired at the House of Co~Tection on July 26, 1998. The Plaintiff in Torres Ramirez was\narrested on a vacated warrant and brought suit against the Puerto Rico officials allegedly\nresponsible for the arrest, Luna and Bermudez. The Defendants appealed the jury verdict against\nthem. One basis of the appeal was that the actiolas of the marshals in failing to withdraw the\nwarrant, or noting that it was previously served, was merely negligence and did not give rise to a\nDue Process claim. The Court agreed with respe,zt to Defendant Bermudez, but found the jury\ncould have believed that Defendant Luna knowingly processed an invalid warrant or that he\nrecklessly acted with disregard for the probability a ultimate illegal arrest. Id at 227. The record\nreflects that another officer, not Rao, was aware that the warrant had been recalled. Raoโs\nconduct, like that of Defendant Bermudez did nc~t rise to the level of recklessness necessary to\nconvert a negligent act to a constitutional violation. Finding a due process violation under these\nfacts would trivialize the protection of the Due Process clause, an action the Supreme Court\nwarned against in Daniels.\nMore recently the Appeals Court address,ed another similar situation in Pena-Borrero v.\nEstremeda, 365 F. 3d 7 (1st Cir. 2004). The Coul~t reversed the District Courtโs dismissal of a\ncivil rights complaint brought by an individual who was arrested at his home at 3:30 a.m. on a\nvacated warrant. In that case the plaintiffpresented to the arresting officers a copy of the\nexecuted arrest warrant and a copy of the receipt for bond. The Court determined that Plaintiff\nplead sufficient facts to survive a Motion to Dismiss. The Court recognized that the arresting\nofficers may have been simply negligent. I__d at 13. The existence of facially authentic\ndocumentary evidence that the warrant was no longer effective, and the failure of the officers to\nfollow precautionary procedures to assure its vitality provided a sufficient basis for a claim under\n\nthe Fourth Amendment. I~. The case is not controlling with regard to Raoโs actions because of\nthe factual distinctions, including the conduct of the arresting officers, and the standard of review\napplied by the Court. Plaintiffsโ Co~nplaint alleges a violation of Due Process. Therefore, the\nstandard of revie~v is \"reckless or callous\" as opposed to the reasonable standard applied under\nthe Fourth Amendment. The summary judgment record does not support a finding that Rao\nacted in a reckless or callous tnanner with regard to the short detention of DeToledo or the arrest\nof Williams. Raoโs reliance on the Departmentโs computer system and his tnisreading of the\nwarrant provided him a good :faith basis to believe he was executing a valid arrest warrant.\nAdditionally, under Due Process claims, the intent of the actor controls. See Germany v~\nVance, 868 F.2d 9, 18 n. t0. Raoโs intent was to comply with his obligations as Shift\nCommander. The officers in Pena-Borrero arrived at Plaintiff house in the middle of the night;\nused force against him resulting in injury; and caused his children to be driven away. It was the\naffirmative acts of the officers; that precipitated the civil rights claim. Conversely, Rao did not\naffirmatively seek to arrest anyone. Williams appeared at the House of Correction. Rao believed\nhe had no option but to arrest her. (Rao Dep. p. 56 ) Again, Raoโs actions under the\ncircumstances ~vere not an abuse of the power he is afforded as a law enforcement official. He\nwas merely trying to do his job.\n1. The Detention of Antonia DeToledo Was Not in Violation of Her Due\nProcess Rights.\nPlaintiff Antonia DeToledo was mistaken for Liana Williams when she exited the\nrestroom at the House of Correction. She was held a matter of minutes and was released\nimmediately when the mistake was discovered. Her continued presence in the booking area was\ndue to her medical condition and attempts to cahn her down by medical personnel. She was in\nhandcuffs approximately 4 minutes. Any restraint on her liberty ended when it was determined\n\nthat she was not the proper person and the handcuffs were removed. She was free to go at that\npoint, but remained in the area until EMS arrived for her o~vn protection. Rao reasonably\nbelieved DeToledo was Williams. He mistakenly believed DeToledo was the subject of a valid\narrest ~varrant and effectuated her detention for ~Lpproximately five minutes. Given the\ncircumstances, Raoโs actions with regard to Plai~atiffDeToledo were reasonable. He had been\nadvised that the subject of the warrant had taken the key for the ladies room. DeToledo exited\nthe ladies room. Rao had no reason to believe anyone else was present in the ladies room since\nonly one person would be in tlhe ladies room at a time. Rao compared the photo ID to the women\nexiting the ladies room and believed them to be l~,he same person, albeit with a different hair cut,\nand possibly an old picture. When asked if she u~as Liana Williams, she responded affirmatively.\nWhen asked a second time, she again responded affirmatively. It was only after her confirmation\nthat she was Williams that she indicated she did not understand English. A Spanish-speaking\nofficer tried to explain to her what was happening. Rao made an identification error. It was\nimmediately corrected when discovered.\nIn determining whether a plaintiffhas suffered a Due Process violation the Court looks to\nthe length of detention, the behavior of police, and source and quality of information before\nthem. Brady v. Dill, 187 F.3d 104, 115 (1 ~t Cir. 1999). Applying those factors to the short\ndetention of DeToledo, she cannot establish a cognizable due process claim against Rao.\nAdditionally, law enforcement officials do not necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment by\napproaching suspects, questio:ning them, or detaining them. Terrw. Ohio, 392 U.S. l, 19-20\n(1968). There is evidence in the record that DeToledo was under the influence of alcohol. (See\nEx. 10 ). She was informed she was being detained for identification purposes. Given her stated\n9\n\ninability to remember any conversation with Sheriffโs Department staff or medical personnel, an\ninvestigatory stop, including a brief detention to determine her identity was not unreasonable.\n2. The Detention of Liana Williams Was Not in Violation of Her Due\nProcess Rights.\nPlaintiff Williams was the subject of the recalled warrant. She was detained, searched and\ntransported to the Nashua Stre, et Jail where it was determined that the warrant had been recalled.\nShe alleges violation of her Due Process Rights. As indicated with PlaintiffDeToledo, Raoโs\nactions with respect to Willioans were reasonable in light of the information known to him at the\ntime. When advised that the Departmentโs tracking system computer indicated a warrant for\nLiana Williams, Rao inquired of the visiting supervisor if there was any information on Williams\nin the office. The incident took place on a Sunday evening. On the previous Friday, the recaI1\nwas printed and forwarded to Sergeant Ruplis. (Lewis report). She failed to take the restriction\noffthe computer screen. (Ruplis report). Had Ruplis removed the restriction, as she should have,\nthe events of July 26, 1998 would not have occurred. Rao was aware of a restriction on the\ncomputer screen and that there was paperwork with Williamsโ name on it in the visitor\nsupervisorsโ office. It was reasonable for him to assume that warrant was good, since if it was\nrecalled, the restriction should have been removed. As noted above, the inquiry is, was it\nreasonable for him to rely on the information contained in the Departmentโs computer system\nthat indicated Williams had an outstanding warrant. See Roche 81 [:. 3d at 255. His actions with\nrespect to Williams may have been negligent, however his conduct did not rise to the level of\nrecklessness or callousness necessary to find a violation of Due Process.\n10\n\n3. The Plaintiffโs Cannot State A Claim For Excessive Force.\nIn addition to the deprivation of liberty claim, the Plaintilgfs also claim the Defendants\ninterfered with their right to be free from excessive and/or unreasonable force. Where an\nexcessive use of force claim arises in the context of an arrest it is most properly characterized as\none invoking the protections of the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees citizens \"to be secure\nin their persons.., against unreasonable.., seizures of the person.\" J arrett v. Yarmouth, 331 F. 3d\n140, 148 (1~ Cir. 2003) There is no allegation in the Complaint, and the summaryjudgrnent\nrecord does not establish that any force was used other than that necessary to effect an arrest on\neither plaintiff. Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized the right to make an arrest\nor investigatory stop necessavly carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion.\nGraham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 386 (1989). The \"reasonableness\" of the force used must be\njudged by an objective standard. In the instant case, there was no excessive force used. The only\nforce used was the applicatiol~ of restraints. In light of the facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe incidents, the use of restraints was objectively reasonable. Additionally, Rao agreed to\nwithhold placing restraints on Williams until she was out of sight of her children.\nTo the extend Williams claims her strip-search was a use of excessive force, the\nDefendants are immune from suit as outlined below.\n2. SUMMARY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE GRANTED TO THE\nINDIVIDUAL, DEFENDANTS, AS THEY ARE IMMUNE FROM SUIT.\nDefendants Angelo Rao, janet Sinclair, and Sylvia Thomas are immune from suit as\ngovernmental employees entitled to qualified immunity from claims against them in their\nindividual capacity. See, Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986). Qualified immunity is an\nentitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation. Mitchell v. Forsyth 472 U.S.\n51 I, 526 (1985). The privilege is an immunity fi-om suit, not merely a defense to liability, id.\nI1\n\nThe immunity may only be overcome by a showing that they participated personally in depriving\nthe plaintiff of a clearly establ.ished constitutional right. See, Febus-RodriCuez v. Betancourt-\nLebron, 14 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.1994). The U.S. Supreme Court has determined that at two-part\ntest should be employed where Defendantsโ seek qualified immunity. See Saucier v. Katz, 533\nU.S. 194, 201 (2001). The initial inquiry must be: taking in the light most favorable to the party\nasserting the injury, do the fac, ts show the officersโ conduct violated a constitutional right? Id.\nSecond, if such a violation is established, the next question is whether the fight was clearly\nestablished, analyzed \"in ligh! of the specific context of the case, not as a broad proposition.\" Id.\nThe inquiry undertaken is that of reasonableness in light of the surrounding circumstances of the\nparticular case. Jarrett v. Yarmouth, 331 F. 3d 140, 148 (1st Cir. 2003). As discussed above,\nDefendants contend in the instant case that there was no constitutional violation. However, if the\nCourt were to find a violation of the Plaintiffsโ Due Process fights, the individually named\nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity and thus entitled to Judgment as a matter of Law.\n1. Captain Raoโs Actions With Regard To Plaintiff DeToledo Were\nReasonable And Therefore Protected By Qualified Immunity.\nQualified immunity \"provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or\nthose who knowingly violate the law.\" See, Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury 112 F.3d 19, 22 (1 ~t\nCir. 1997), citing Malley.v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335,341 (1986). The Defendants do not dispute\nthat the Plaintiffs have a fight :not to be deprived of liberty without the due process of Iaw.\nWhether the right was clearly established depends upon whether it would be clear to a reasonable\nofficer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.\n194, 202 (2001 ). All actions taken by Defendant Rao with regard to Plaintiff DeToledo were\nreasonable. If the warrant had been an active wa~:rant, Rao would clearly be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity. See Hill v. Califomia_, 401 U.S. 797 (1971). However, the absence of a valid\nwarrant does not strip Rao of the protection of q~aalified immunity if he acted in an objectively\nreasonable manner with regard to DeToledoโs brief detention for identification purposes. Saucier\nat 202. The constitutionality of conduct is not tl~e determining factor in whether a public official\nis entitled to qualified immunity. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.635,641 (1987). As indicated\nabove, Captain Rao acted reasonably in detaining DeToledo for a very short period of time. He\ncannot be stripped of protection when the actionโs were reasonable, even if mistaken. \"[L]aw\nenforcement officials will in some cases reasonably but mistakenly conclude that [their conduct]\nis [constitutional] and ... that ... those officials --like other officials who act in ways they\nreasonably believe to be lawful -should not be held personally liable.\" He,arty v. Somerset\nCount2, 53 F.3d 1367, 1373 (1l~t Cir. 1995), citing, Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.635,641\n(1987).\nCaptain Rao, Deputy Thomas And Sergeant Sinclairโs Actions With\nRegard To Plaintiff Will Jams Were Reasonable And Therefore\nProtected By Qualified Immunity.\nPlaintiff Williams was arrested on a warrant that had been recalled. Captain Rao\nacknowledged that he made ar~ error in reading the warrant paperwork. The Defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity for both the detention of Williams and the resulting strip search.\nA. Defendants Are Entitled To Qualified Immunity For The Arrest Of\nWilliams.\nIn her Complaint, Plai~ttiff does not allege any violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n(Exhibit 1) She alleges her right to liberty without due process was violated. As such, the\ndetermination of the lawfulness of her detention lies in the analysis as listed above. Raoโs\ndecision to place her in custody may have been negligent, however, it did not rise to the level of\n13\n\na due process violation. The a,:tions of all Defendants were reasonable with regard to the\ndecision to place Williams under arrest. Thoma,โ; and Sinclair ~vere standing by and obeying the\norders of their supervisor. There is nothing in the record to show Thomas or Sinclair contributed\nin anyway to the decision to arrest Williams. Rao made a mistake in reading the warrant. The\nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\nA fundamental justification for the qualified immunity defense is that public employees\nare free to perform discretionary functions withc~ut fear of punitive litigation except when they\nfairly can anticipate that their conduct will give rise to liability for damages. Savard v. Rhode\nIsland, 338 F. 3d 23, 28 (1~t Cir. 2003). Captain Rao was simply performing his duties as shift\ncommander on July 26, 1998. Sinclair and Thomas were following orders. A string of\nunconnected unfortunate events lead to the detention of DeToledo and the arrest of Williams.\nThere was no way for the Defendant Sinclair or Thomas to anticipate that performing their duties\nin the course of their employment on July 26, 1998 would result in the instant litigation.\nArguably, Captain Rao, as the., commanding officer assumes some risk with in conjunction with\nthe responsibility of his position. The same risk !is not borne by Sinclair and Thomas.\nAdditionally, qualified immunity exists not only to protect public officials from money\ndamages, but also to also prevent the distraction from their official duties, prevent the cost of\nlitigation and the deterrence of able-bodied people from public service. Guzman-Rivera v. Rivera\nCruz, 98 F. 3d 664, 665 (.1~t Cir. 1996) citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald ,457 U.S. 800, 816 (1982).\nDenying the Defendants qualified immunity in this case, where an accumulation of missteps\nsnowballed to cause any injuries alleged would have a chilling effect on maintaining able bodied\nindividuals from seeking employment with the S.heriffโs Department. Such is true especially with\nregard to Thomas and Sinclair. Neither made the, decision to arrest Williams, nor did they have\n14\n\nthe authority to make such a decision. Neither actually saw the warrant. And finally, neither\nacted outside the scope of their employment or what they had been trained to do. The Summary\nJudgment record is void of any indication that either Sinclair or Thomas were plainly\nincompetent or knowingly violated the law thus they should be afforded qualified immunity.\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335,341 (1986). If the law did not put Sinclair or Thomas on notice\nthat their conduct would clearly be unlawful, summary judgment based on qualified immunity is\nappropriate. Saucier v. Katz, 5;33 U.S. 194, 202 (2001).\nB. The Defendants Are Entitled To Qualified Immunity For The Search\nOf Williams.\nWilliams was strip-searched incident to her arrest. There is an issue of fact pertaining to\nwho conducted the strip search of Plaintiff Williarns, Sinclair or Thomas. At this stage, the fact is\nnot material, however, as regardless of which officer conducted the search, she is entitled to\nqualified immunity. The search of Williams was conducted according to Sheriffโs Department\nPolicy in effect at the time. The Officer that conducted the search believed that Williams was in\nthe lawful custody of the Department. Strip-searches of pretrial detainees, such as the Plaintiff\nare not per se unconstitutional Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).\n\"Qualified immunity specially protects public officials from the specter of damages\nliability for judgment calls made in a legally uncertain environment.\" Ryder v. United Sates, 515\nU.S. 177, 185 (I995), citing l~[arlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S 800, 806 (1982). At the time of\nPlaintiffโs search, July 26, 19981 the law was unclear with regard to searches on arrestees such as\nthe Plaintiff. The Courtsโ decision in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997) dealt with\n~ The class action strip- search case against the County tbr searches conducted at the jail was filed after the search at\nissue here. Consequently, the officer that conducted the search would have no reason to doubt the lawfulness of the\nsearch.\n15\n\nan arrestee at a police station held on a very minor offense. Williamsโ charges while not violent,\ncannot be said to be minor.\nActions are to be measured by a standard of objective legal reasonableness in light of the\nlegal rules that were established at the time [they] were taken. St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71\nF.3d 20, 24 (1S~. Cir. 1995) ci~.ing, Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S~ 635,639 (1987). The First\nCircuit Court does not \"require public officials to foretell the course of constitutional law with\nabsolute accuracy in order to obtain the bairn of qualified immunity. Savard v. Rhode Island, 338\nF. 3d 23, 33-34 (1s~ Cir. 2003). See also, Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603,618 (1999), (\"[i]f\njudges thus disagree on a con~,titutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money damages\nfor picking the losing side of the controversy.\")\nThe Courtโs discussion in Roberts vb Rhode Island 239 F.3d 107, (1~ Cir. 2001) and the\naftermath of that case demonstrates the uncertai~tty of the law in the area o f custodial strip-\nsearches. The Roberts case prompted additional litigation against Rhode Island prison officials\nby subsequent Plaintiffs held on minor offenses that were searched pursuant to the policy struck\ndown in Roberts. See, Savard v. tkhode Island, 338 F. 3d 23, (1 โ~ Cir. 2003). Recently, the First\nCircuit Court of Appeals granl;ed qualified immunity to prison officials in Rhode Island for the\nstrip-searches of Plaintiffs arrested for \"non-viol.~nt, non-drug related minor offenses\". Id. The\nCourt found that it was not clearly established that blanket strip-searches of misdemeanant\narrcstees conducted without particularized suspicion at a maximum-security prison were\nunconstitutional. Id. at 33-34.\nThe relevant dispositive inquiry in determining if a right has been clearly established for\npurposes of qualified immunity is ~vhether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that her\nconduct was unlawful in the situation confronted. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.So 194, 202 (2001). At\n16\n\nthe time Williams was searched, whether Sinclair of Thomas conducted the search, the officer\nwould not consider the search unlawful. Therefore, the officer that conducted the search is\nentitled to qualified immunity,\n3. DEFENDANTS .4~RE IMMUNE FROM SUIT FOR THE STATE CIVIL\nRIGItTS CLAIMS.\nThe Counts against the individual defendants aver identical causes of action. Claims\nagainst the individuals under the Mass Civil Rights Statute state:\nOn or about July 26, 1998, the defendant:z, while in the course of his employment\nwith the County of Suffolk created a threatening, intimidating and coercive\nenvironment at the South Bay House of Correction.

Defendant Rao was at all times relevant to the Plaintiffsโ complaint acting \nwith official discretion with an objectively reasonable belief that his \nactions were lawful and not in violation of any clearly established \nstatutory or constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have \nknown.  \n \n13.  At all times Defendant Rao acted in accordance with the laws of the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts and the Constitution of the United \nStates and therefore is immune because of good faith.  \n  \n14.  Plaintiff Williams has failed to assert facts sufficient to state claim against \nDefendant Rao under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. \n \n15.  Plaintiffsโ claims are barred by their own unclean hands.  \n \n16.  The Defendants hereby give notice that they intend to rely upon such other \nand further defenses as may become available or apparent during \ndiscovery proceedings in this action and hereby reserves the right to \namend its answer and to assert any such defense by  appropriate motion. \n \n \n \nJURY DEMAND \n \nDefendants demand trial by jury as to all issues of this case.  \n \n \n              Respectfully Submitted for \n              County of Suffolk, Angelo Rao \n              By,  \n               \n              /s/ Kathleen M.

Parker, Parker Scheer LLP, Boston, MA, for Antonia Detoledo, Liana Williams, Plaintiffs.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nSTEARNS, District Judge.\nPlaintiffs Antonia DeToledo and Liana Williams allege to have been unlawfully arrested, detained, and in Williams'\ncase, subjected to an illegal strip search on July 26, 1998, during a visit to the South Bay House of Corrections\n[1]\n(South Bay). Defendants Captain Angelo Rao,  Sergeant Janet Sinclair, and Deputy Sylvia Thomas are South\nBay corrections officers employed by defendant Suffolk County. The Complaint was originally filed on June 13,\n2001, in Suffolk Superior Court, where it resided for two years before being removed to the United States District\nCourt. The Complaint seeks to establish personal liability on the part of the individual defendants for violation of\nthe plaintiffs' civil rights and vicarious liability on the part of Suffolk County under G.L. c. 258 (the Massachusetts\nTort Claims Act) for defendants' alleged negligence. The defendants deny that any right secured by federal or\n[2]\nstate law was violated. The individual defendants move for summary judgment on all claims.\n141 BACKGROUND\n*141\nIn the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the facts are as follows. On Friday evening, July 24, 1998, Liana Williams\nsought to visit her fiance, Michael Etheridge, then a detainee at South Bay. When Sergeant Elaine Ruplis, the\nvisitors' supervisor, ran a routine computer check, she discovered that Williams was the subject of an outstanding\nwarrant. Investigating further, Ruplis learned from Donald Lewis, a records officer, that the warrant had been\nrecalled. Lewis printed out the recall notice and gave it to Ruplis. Ruplis, however, neglected to enter the\n[3]\ncorrection into South Bay's computer system.\nOn July 26, 1998, Williams returned to South Bay to visit Etheridge. When she arrived at the visitor's area,\nAntonia DeToledo was already present. The two women did not know one another. While processing Williams,\nOfficer Robert Rowland came upon the warrant listing. He immediately notified Captain Rao, the shift\ncommander. Rao asked Sergeant Sinclair to retrieve a copy of the warrant. While doing so, Sinclair discovered\n[4]\nthe recall notice that Lewis had given to Ruplis. Sinclair delivered the notice and a copy of the warrant to Rao.\nRao reviewed the paperwork and mistakenly determined that the warrant was active. In his deposition, Rao\n[5]\ntestified that he did not have his prescription glasses with him and was unable to read the warrant.  Rowland\ntold Rao that Williams had asked for the key to the ladies' room and had left her driver's license as a deposit.\nRowland gave the driver's license to Rao. Williams, however, had not gone to the ladies' room but had given the\n[6]\nkey to her stepson so that he could visit the men's room.\n\nRao proceeded to the restroom area of the lobby. As a woman emerged from the ladies' room, Rao compared her\nlikeness to the picture on Williams' driver's license. Rao testified that while the similarities were not obvious (the\nhairstyles were different), he thought that the picture might be dated. The woman was in fact DeToledo. Rowland\ntestified that he knew that the wrong woman had been singled out \"but opted not to say anything until the officers\nentered the Booking Area ... to avoid a scene in front of the other visitors.\" DeToledo, whose native language is\nPortugese and who speaks only limited English, was confronted by Rao and other uniformed officers. DeToledo\n142 testified *142 that she was so shaken by the confrontation that she does not recall any conversation. Both Rao\nand Rowland testified that when DeToledo was asked if she was Liana Williams, she nodded affirmatively. The\nquestion was repeated and DeToledo answered \"yes.\" When the officers informed her of the arrest warrant,\nDeToledo indicated that she did not understand what they were saying. She was handcuffed and escorted\n[7]\ntowards the booking area.  The procession came to halt a minute or two later when Rowland told Rao about the\nmistake in identity. Before the handcuffs could be removed, DeToledo began to have difficulty breathing. Medical\npersonnel were summoned and an ambulance transported DeToledo to the Boston Medical Center.\nRao meanwhile located Williams in the lobby where she was standing with her six-month old baby and her\nstepson. Rao told Williams that she was being arrested on an outstanding warrant. Williams protested repeatedly\nthat the warrant had been recalled and that documentary proof that the warrant was invalid could be found in her\nvisitor's locker. Rao refused Williams' requests to retrieve the documents.\nWilliams asked the officers to summon a friend to take custody of her children. She also asked that they not\nhandcuff her in the children's presence. The officers complied with both requests and handcuffed Williams only\nafter she had passed through the metal detector leading to the sallyport. Once inside, Williams was taken to a\n[8]\n\"shake down\" room where either Sinclair or Deputy Thomas conducted a strip and visual body cavity search.\nBefore and during the strip search, Williams told Thomas and Sinclair that she had proof that the warrant had\nbeen recalled. Williams was forced to remove all of her clothing, bend over and separate her buttocks, and open\nher mouth for visual inspection.\nAfter the search, Williams was confined for several hours in a holding cell. At approximately 9:00 p.m., she was\nshackled and transported to the Nashua Street Jail. Upon arrival at Nashua Street, the admitting officer, after\nexamining the papers, told the transportation officers that the warrant was invalid. Williams was returned to South\nBay at approximately 11:00 p.m. She eventually arranged for a friend to meet her and drive her home.\nAlmost three years later, Williams and DeToledo filed this joint lawsuit against Suffolk County and \"John Doe\" in\nthe Suffolk Superior Court. After a period of discovery, plaintiffs amended the Complaint to add the individual\ndefendants and claims under the federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. The defendants thereafter removed\nthe case to the federal district court.\nThe Amended Complaint is framed in twenty counts. Plaintiffs eventually agreed to voluntarily dismiss defendant\nOwen Julius (Counts XIII through XVI). DeToledo also dismissed her civil rights claims against Sinclair and\nThomas (Counts XVII and XIX). The remaining counts allege federal and state civil rights violations on the part of\nRao (both plaintiffs, Counts V through VIII) and Sinclair and Thomas (Williams only, Counts X, XII, XVIII, and XX).\n143 DeToledo and Williams also assert claims under the Massachusetts *143 Tort Claims Act against Suffolk County\n(Counts I through IV).\nDISCUSSION\nSummary judgment is appropriate only when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\nand that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The movant has the\n\"`initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions' of the\nrecord showing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact.\" See Bates v. Mackay, 321 F.Supp.2d 173, 178\n(D.Mass.2004),quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).\nThe Civil Rights Claims\n\nDeToledo asserts against Rao a Fourteenth Amendment due process-deprivation of liberty claim (the brief\ndetention that occurred when Rao mistook her for Williams) and a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim (the\n[9]\napplication of handcuffs).  Williams alleges identical claims against Rao, as well as an excessive force claim\n[10]\n(the strip search) against Sinclair and Thomas.  Government officials may be held liable under ยง 1983 for a\ndeprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law if their conduct amounts to a reckless or callous\nindifference to an individual's constitutional rights. Germany v. Vance, 868 F.2d 9, 21 (1st Cir.1989). \"We have\nemphasized time and again that `[t]he touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary\naction of government,'... whether the fault lies in a denial of fundamental procedural fairness, ... or in the exercise\nof power without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective....\" County of\nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845-846, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998). To be actionable under\nthe Due Process Clause, misconduct by state actors must exceed a high threshold of allowance for human\nshortcomings in managing the intricate processes of government. \"[T]he Constitution does not guarantee due\ncare on the part of state officials; liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of\nconstitutional due process.... It is, on the contrary, behavior at the other end of the culpability spectrum that would\nmost probably support a substantive due process claim; conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by\nany government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level.\" Id., at\n849, 118 S.Ct. 1708. See also Davidson v. Cannon, 474 U.S. 344, 347-348, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677\n(1986) (a merely negligent deprivation of life, liberty, or property, \"simply does not approach the sort of abusive\ngovernment conduct that the Due Process Clause was designed to prevent.\").\nIn Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 334 n. 3, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), the Supreme Court\nacknowledged that \"something less than intentional conduct, such as recklessness or `gross negligence,' [could\n144 be] enough to trigger the *144 protections of the Due Process Clause.\" Cf. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 836\nn. 4, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (\"Between the poles [of negligence and purpose or knowledge] lies\n`gross negligence' too, but the term is a `nebulous' one, in practice typically meaning little different from\nrecklessness as generally understood in the civil law.\"). In the wake of Daniels, the \"less than intentional\"\nstandard came to be defined as one of \"deliberate indifference,\" that is, a state of mind reflecting a conscious\ndisregard or callous indifference to an individual's rights, sufficiently egregious to \"shock the conscience.\" See \nWood v. Ostrander, 879 F.2d 583, 588 (9th Cir.1989) (officer's \"deliberate indifference\" and \"callous disregard\" for\nthe physical safety of a woman whom he left stranded in a dangerous neighborhood); White v. Rochford, 592\nF.2d 381, 383 (7th Cir.1979) (officers' callous disregard for the safety of children who were left unattended on the\nshoulder of a busy freeway after their parents' arrest). See also Miga v. City of Holyoke, 398 Mass. 343, 351-352,\n497 N.E.2d 1 (1986) (officers manifested \"deliberate indifference\" in leaving an intoxicated, semi-conscious, and\nsuicidal detainee alone despite warnings from other prisoners about her erratic behavior).\nThat both DeToledo and Williams were undisputedly innocent detainees is not dispositive of the deprivation of\nliberty claim.\nRespondent's innocence of the charge contained in the warrant, while relevant to a tort claim of false\nimprisonment in most if not all jurisdictions, is largely irrelevant to his claim of deprivation of liberty without due\nprocess of law. The Constitution does not guarantee that only the guilty will be arrested. If it did, ยง 1983 would\nprovide a cause of action for every defendant acquitted 00 indeed, for every suspect released.\n97\nBaker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 145, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979). DeToledo's claim is the easier to\naddress. At most, DeToledo was the victim of a negligent case of mistaken identity. Having been told by Rowland\nthat Williams had asked for the bathroom key, Rao made the reasonable assumption that Williams was using the\nladies' room. He attempted to verify Williams' identity by consulting, however ineptly, the picture on Williams'\ndriver's license. He also elicited what he reasonably believed was a confirmation by DeToledo that she was in\nfact Williams before placing her under arrest. Alerted to the mistake by Rowland, Rao immediately rescinded the\narrest. That DeToledo suffered an apparent anxiety attack is unfortunate, but \"[t]he Due Process Clause is simply\nnot implicated by a negligent act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty or property.\" \nDaniels, 474 U.S. at 328, 106 S.Ct. 662. Consequently, DeToledo's deprivation of liberty claim will be dismissed.\n[11]\n\nWilliams' deprivation of liberty claim presents a closer issue. An officer who reasonably believes that he has\nprobable cause to make an arrest has no duty to investigate a suspect's claims of innocence. Baker, 443 U.S. at\n146, 99 S.Ct. 2689. See also Sanchez v. Swyden, 139 F.3d 464, 468, n. 8 (5th Cir.1998). To the contrary, the law\ndiscourages officers from taking it upon themselves to make such determinations. \"[A] police officer's initial\nfinding of probable cause justifies not only arrest, but a reasonable period of continued detention for the purpose\n145 of bringing the *145 arrestee before a magistrate.... Generally, once the arrest has been properly effected, it is\nthe magistrate and not the policeman who should decide whether probable cause has dissipated to such an\nextent following arrest that the suspect should be released.\" Thompson v. Olson, 798 F.2d 552, 556 (1st\nCir.1986). See Brady v. Dill, 187 F.3d 104, 114 (1st Cir.1999) (an inverse rule would have \"the potential of turning\npolice stations into tribunals for making preliminary determinations of guilt or innocence.\").\nThe First Circuit, however, has identified an exception to the general rule. In Torres Ramirez v. Bermudez Garcia,\n898 F.2d 224 (1st Cir.1990), the general marshal of the Guayama Court ordered the execution of an aging\nwarrant without first checking readily accessible court records that showed that the warrant had been vacated.\nThe Court of Appeals, in reversing a grant of summary judgment, held that a trier of fact could find that the\nmarshal had acted recklessly in failing to verify the validity of the warrant. Id.,898 F.2d at 227. In Pena-Borrero v.\nEstremeda, 365 F.3d 7 (1st Cir.2004), the Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion with respect to officers\nwho persisted in executing a warrant despite being offered conclusive documentary evidence by the arrestee that\n[12]\nthe warrant had been withdrawn. Id. at 13. Rao's actions cannot be meaningfully distinguished from those of\nthe officers in Pena-Borrero. It may be that he had no duty to retrieve the documents from Williams' locker,\nalthough there was no impediment to his doing so or to his assigning the task to another officer. But there was no\nneed to consult the documents in the locker. Rao was holding proof that the warrant was invalid in his own hands.\nIt may be that Rao's vision was impaired because his glasses were \"in the shop,\" as he testified at his deposition.\nThat, however, is all the more reason why his failure to ask another officer to verify the meaning of the black line\nscratched over the face of the warrant, particularly in light of Williams' repeated protestations, could be found by\na trier of fact to have crossed the line separating excusable neglect from reckless obstinacy and deliberate\nindifference to a another's rights. Consequently, the motion to dismiss Williams' deprivation of liberty claim will be\n[13]\ndenied.\n146 The purpose of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA) is to provide *146 under state law a remedy\n\"coextensive with 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 except that the Federal statute requires State action whereas its State\ncounterpart does not.\" Batchelder v. Allied Stores Corp., 393 Mass. 819, 822-823, 473 N.E.2d 1128 (1985). The\nMCRA is remedial in nature. It creates no substantive rights. Mouradian v. General Electric Co., 23 Mass.App.Ct.\n538, 543, 503 N.E.2d 1318 (1987). Thus, in order \"to seek redress through [the MCRA as under its Federal\nanalog, 42 U.S.C.] ยง 1983 ... a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal [or State] right, not merely a violation\nof federal [or State] law.\" Perkins v. Commonwealth, 52 Mass.App.Ct. 175, 181, 752 N.E.2d 761 (2001),quoting \nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 137 L.Ed.2d 569 (1997). Moreover, in deference to the\nLegislature's concern that the MCRA not be interpreted to create \"a vast constitutional tort,\" the Act is \"explicitly\nlimited\" to situations \"where the derogation of secured rights occurs by threats, intimidation or coercion\" involving\na harm \"directed toward a particular individual or class of persons.\" Bally v. Northeastern University, 403 Mass.\n713, 718-719, 532 N.E.2d 49 (1989).\nFor purposes of the MCRA, \"a `threat' ... involves the intentional exertion of pressure to make another fearful or\napprehensive of injury or harm.... `Intimidation' involves putting in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring\nconduct.... [`Coercion' involves] `the application to another of such force, either physical or moral, as to constrain\n[a person] to do against his will something he would not otherwise have done.'\" Planned Parenthood League of\nMassachusetts, Inc. v. Blake, 417 Mass. 467, 474, 631 N.E.2d 985 (1994). While the MCRA does not require\nproof of specific intent it operates \"almost entirely within the realm of `intentional' behavior.\" Breault v. Chairman\nof the Bd. of Fire Comm'rs of Springfield, 401 Mass. 26, 36, 513 N.E.2d 1277 (1987). Thus, negligence by itself is\ninsufficient to establish the element of \"threat, intimidation or coercion\" as by definition negligence \"excludes\nintentional conduct.\" Deas v. Dempsey, 403 Mass. 468, 471, 530 N.E.2d 1239 (1988).\nApplying these principles, DeToledo's claim under the MCRA must be dismissed as the most that she can show\nis negligence on Rao's part. On the other hand, while I am not aware of a case under the MCRA specifically\n\nequating recklessness with intentional conduct, I infer from the Supreme Judicial Court's repeated admonitions\nthat the Act is intended to provide relief coextensive with that offered by ยง 1983, that the state of mind 00\n97\ndeliberate indifference 00 sufficient to establish liability under ยง 1983 would also serve to establish liability under\n97\nthe MCRA. Thus, the motion to dismiss Williams' MCRA claim, to the extent that it alleges a deprivation of liberty,\nwill be denied.\nQualified Immunity\nSinclair and Thomas claim that they are entitled to a grant of qualified immunity for their actions in strip searching\nWilliams. Qualified immunity attaches to discretionary conduct of government officials that \"does not violate\nclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). \"[T]he qualified immunity inquiry ... allows\n... for the inevitable reality that `law enforcement officials will in some cases reasonably but mistakenly conclude\nthat [their conduct] is [constitutional], and ... that ... those officials 00 like other officials who act in ways they\n97\n147 reasonably believe to be lawful 00 should*147not be held personally liable.'\" Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53\n97\nF.3d 1367, 1373 (1st Cir.1995),quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d\n523 (1987). \"The qualified immunity standard `gives ample room for mistaken judgments' by protecting `all but\nthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.'\" Rivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d 259, 263 (1st\nCir.1992),quoting Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 229, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991) (per curiam).\nIn deciding whether qualified immunity attaches, \"a court must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a\ndeprivation of an actual constitutional right at all.\" Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290, 119 S.Ct. 1292, 143\nL.Ed.2d 399 (1999). Stated more formally, the \"threshold\" question is this: \"Taken in the light most favorable to\nthe party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right? ... If\nno constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further\ninquiries concerning qualified immunity.\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272\n(2001). Only if a violation of a right is found does the court proceed to answer the two remaining questions: was\nthe right clearly established when the plaintiff suffered the constitutional injury; and if so, \"whether a reasonable\nprison official, situated similarly to the defendants, would have understood at the time that the policy in place ...\n[14]\ntransgressed the Constitution.\" Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir.2003).\nCourts share the consensus view that a strip and visual body cavity search is a severe and degrading intrusion\ninto personal privacy and bodily integrity, and if conducted without some reasonable basis, violates the Fourth\nAmendment. Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 110, 113 (1st Cir.2001). Thus, the first step in the Saucier\nsequential analysis \"need not detain us.\" Savard, 338 F.3d at 27. The second step requires a determination of\nwhether the right of a person arrested for a nonviolent crime to be free of a suspicionless strip search incident to\nincarceration was clearly established on July 26, 1998. In Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F.Supp.2d 131\n(D.Mass.2001), a case challenging the identical strip search policy at issue here, Judge Gertner concluded that\nthe right to be free of such searches was established on June 25, 1997, when the Court of Appeals in Swain v.\nSpinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997), held that a strip search of an arrestee \"ordinarily\" requires a reasonable\nsuspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband, weapons, or evidence on her person. Savard, 338 F.3d at\n29.\n148 *148 There is a longstanding tension in the law between the rights of pretrial detainees and the imperative\ndemands of institutional security. In 1979, the Supreme Court made clear that the Constitution imposed no\ncategorical bar to the strip searching of persons jailed while awaiting trial, nor did the law require probable cause\nfor such searches, so long as the actions of prison officials were reasonable in scope, manner, and purpose. Bell\nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558-560, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). As the law developed after Wolfish,\nmore stringent standards came to govern strip searches of pretrial detainees than those applicable to convicted\ninmates. Courts also drew distinctions among pretrial detainees depending upon the nature of the crime for which\nthey were arrested and the type of institution in which they were held. In Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 887-888\n(1st Cir.1983) (Breyer, J.), the First Circuit gave wide berth to a prison policy subjecting inmates to indiscriminate\nstrip searches. \"We reasoned that because the searches involved the most dangerous of prisoners as they\ndeparted from, and entered into, a particularly sensitive area of a maximum security prison, security concerns\nprovided a compelling justification for the ... policy.\" Savard, 338 F.3d at 29 (discussing Arruda). On the other\n\nhand, courts generally rejected the application of blanket strip search policies to detainees arrested for petty\ncrimes and non-violent misdemeanors, while condoning blanket strip searches of persons arrested for violent\ncrimes and drug-related offenses. See Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 801-803 (2d Cir.1986) (finding\nunconstitutional a policy mandating the strip search of all traffic offenders and misdemeanor arrestees); Stewart\nv. Lubbock County, Texas, 767 F.2d, 153, 155-157 (5th Cir.1985) (misdemeanors punishable only by fines); \nChapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395 (10th Cir.1993) (all arrestees). Compare Thompson v. City of Los\nAngeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir.1989) (upholding mandatory strip searches of all persons arrested for\ncrimes \"associated with violence\"); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989) (same).\nThat Swain settled the strip search issue in this Circuit with respect to pretrial detainees, as Judge Gertner\nthought in Ford, is thrown into doubt by subsequent First Circuit cases. The arrestee in Swain was held in\nisolation in a temporary holding facility where there was no risk of contact with other prisoners. That fact, and the\ndifference in magnitude between security concerns in a holding cell and those in a prison, led an equally divided \nen banc Court in Savard to conclude that neither Swain (nor Arruda) gave definitive guidance with respect to\npretrial detainees.\nIn the end, we recognize that both Swain and Arruda offer valuable insights, but that neither is a very exact\nmatch. While Swain makes clear that strip searches ought not lightly to be indulged, the factual context of the\ncase presented rather minimal security concerns. And while Arruda makes clear that institutional security needs\nmay require intrusive measures in a maximum security setting, that case dealt not with persons arrested for\nrelatively innocuous misdemeanors, but, rather, with hardened criminals. So long as the facts in these cases are\ndistinguishable in a fair way from the facts at hand 00 and we believe that they are 00 then neither of them can be\n97 97\nsaid to have clearly established the law for purposes of a qualified immunity determination in the instant case.\nSavard, 338 F.3d at 30. Savard left standing a district court grant of qualified immunity to defendants who had\n149 implemented *149 a policy mandating strip and visual body cavity searches of all persons admitted to a facility\nhousing pretrial detainees, convicts in protective custody, and newly sentenced felons.\nI will assume without deciding that by July 26, 1998, the law was reasonably clear in banning strip searches in a\ncase like this one (although Swain did not address the issue of the reasonableness of a policy mandating strip\n[15]\nsearches of persons like Williams who are arrested for serious non-violent felonies).  Thus, the remaining step\nin the Saucier analysis requires a determination of whether a reasonable corrections officer in the position of\nThomas (or Sinclair) would have known that her actions in carrying out a strip search in accordance with\ninstitutional policy would violate Williams' Fourth Amendment rights. At the time, the women officers were acting\npursuant to a written directive promulgated by the general counsel of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department on\nbehalf of their ultimate superior, the Sheriff. The policy had been in place in one form or another since at least\n1991. See Ford, 154 F.Supp.2d at 135 n. 6. Neither woman held a policymaking position or was imbued with the\ndiscretionary authority to dispense with the strip search of a prisoner, even had the policy permitted the exercise\nof such discretion. Under the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to conclude that a similarly situated line\nofficer would have believed that compliance with a long-established policy directive emanating from the\nleadership of the Department involved a violation of a prisoner's constitutional rights. That the defendants are\nexcused from liability by virtue of \"following orders\" is not intuitively appealing, but also not shocking in a\ncorrectional environment strongly influenced by military values of hierarchy and obedience to orders. A ruling\nencouraging low-ranking officers to second-guess the constitutionality of policies and procedures mandated by\ntheir superiors would appear neither constitutionally wise nor institutionally desirable. Nor does elemental fairness\ncounsel holding rank-and-file officers liable while letting those who formulated and implemented an\n[16]\nunconstitutional policy go scot free.  Consequently, both Sinclair and Thomas are entitled to a grant of\n[17]\nqualified immunity.\n150 ORDER\n*150\nFor the foregoing reasons, the motion for summary judgment as to DeToledo's claims against Rao as set out in\nCount V (MCRA) and Count VII (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) of the Complaint is ALLOWED. The motion for summary\njudgment as to Williams' federal and state deprivation of liberty claims against Rao as set out in Count VIII and\n\nCount V of the Complaint is DENIED. The claims of DeToledo and Williams that the use of handcuffs constituted\nthe use of excessive force are DISMISSED. The motion for summary judgment as to Williams' claims against\nSinclair and Thomas is ALLOWED. The Clerk will assign a trial date on the remaining claims.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] In the Amended Complaint, Rao's rank is given as lieutenant, although it is apparent from the pleadings that\nhis actual rank was that of Captain.\n[2] No motion has been brought on behalf of Suffolk County.\n[3] Ruplis refused permission for Williams to visit Etheridge that evening after Williams' stepson became unruly.\n[4] The warrant had been issued on September 28, 1995, returnable on complaints alleging receipt of stolen\nproperty, larceny, forgery, and uttering. The latter two offenses are felonies under Massachusetts law. If the value\nof stolen property exceeds $250, receiving stolen property and larceny are also felonies. From the face of the\nwarrant Williams was charged with the felony crimes. The warrant had been recalled on January 13, 1997.\n[5] Specifically, Rao testified that he \"looked down and I could barely make out the letters on the social security\nnumber and the name. I could see the name. I could barely see the social security number. Later on when I was\nin my office writing my report, I looked down and I was looking for the docket number and I couldn't see it. I didn't\nhave my glasses. They were in the shop. So I went down to my locker room and I took out a pair of Osco glasses\nand I came back in and I put them on. And I looked at it at that time and that's when I saw these lines now that\nsay recalled warrant where originally they looked like a black line going across the paper.\"\n[6] The key opened the door to both the mens' and the womens' restrooms. Jail rules permitted only one person\nto be in either bathroom at any given time.\n[7] Sinclair applied the handcuffs on Rao's orders.\n[8] The record is unclear as to which officer performed the search. Thomas testified that Sinclair conducted the\nstrip search while she stood outside the \"shake down\" room. Stephen Jacobs, the Deputy Sheriff who\ninvestigated the incident, quoted Thomas as saying \"that she did the strip search.\"\n[9] Plaintiffs recognize that a false arrest claim is not viable under ยง 1983. See Reid v. New Hampshire, 56 F.3d\n332, 336 n. 8 (1st Cir.1995).\n[10] While the Amended Complaint is somewhat muddled, it is clear from the opposition filed to the motion for\nsummary judgment that both women attribute responsibility for the handcuffing to Rao, while Williams seeks to\nhold Thomas and/or Sinclair liable for the strip search.\n[11] DeToledo, on the other hand, may have a viable cause of action under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act for\nany negligence on Rao's part that resulted in her detention. The proposition is not tested as Suffolk County has\nnot challenged the claim.\n[12] Although Pena-Borrero\npostdates the events underlying the Amended Complaint, the First Circuit in that case rejected a qualified\nimmunity argument, finding that the pursuit of an arrest in the face of unambiguous evidence that a warrant was\nunenforceable was objectively unreasonable and a violation of a plaintiff's clearly established Fourth Amendment\nrights. Id. at 14. Cf. Duckett v. City of Cedar Park, Texas, 950 F.2d 272, 279 (5th Cir.1992) (a suspect arrested\npursuant to a warrant must be released if police determine beyond a reasonable doubt that their warrant is\ninvalid).\n[13] Neither DeToledo nor Williams has a viable excessive force claim arising from the application of handcuffs.\nHandcuffing a detainee is a standard police practice. Absent evidence that the handcuffs were incorrectly applied,\nor were applied so as to cause physical injury, their use does not constitute excessive force. Neague v. Cynkar,\n258 F.3d 504, 508 (6th Cir.2001); Brumfield v. Jones, 849 F.2d 152, 156 (5th Cir.1988) (plaintiff's complaint that\nhandcuffing caused him \"discomfort\" was insufficient to sustain an excessive force claim); (\"[I]n the context of\n\nplacing an individual under arrest, use of handcuffs alone cannot amount to excessive force.\"); McDermott v.\nTown of Windham, 204 F.Supp.2d 54, 67-68 (D.Me.2002) (policy and custom of handcuffing all arrestees did not\nsupport a claim that a municipality condoned the use of excessive force). See also Muehler v. Mena, ___ U.S.\n___, 125 S.Ct. 1465, 1470, 161 L.Ed.2d 299 (2005).\n[14] \"The right in question, ... cannot be simply a generalized right, like the right to due process.... It must be\nclearly established in a `particularized' sense, so that `the contours of the right' are clear enough for any\nreasonable official in the defendant's position to know that what the official is doing violates that right.\" Danese v.\nAsman, 875 F.2d 1239, 1242 (6th Cir.1989). As a rule, a right is \"clearly established\" when it is enunciated by a\ncourt of controlling authority in the defendant's jurisdiction in a case sufficiently similar in its facts \"that a\nreasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 617, 119\nS.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999). See also Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto, 253 F.3d 137, 144-145 (1st Cir.2001)\n(relevant state, as well as federal decisions should be considered). While \"general statements of the law are not\ninherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning,\" they do so only if their application to a specific set of facts is\nclear. United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 271, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997).\n[15] In Roberts, 239 F.3d at 113, the Court of Appeals found a blanket strip search policy unconstitutional insofar\nas it applied to minor offenses. The Court defined \"minor offenses\" as \"misdemeanors involving minor offenses or\ntraffic violations.\" Id. at 112 (emphasis added).\n[16] A political entity that causes a constitutional injury by implementing a constitutionally unsound policy may be\nheld liable for money damages under ยง 1983. Bd. of County Commissioners of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S.\n397, 404, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997). The same is true of a supervisor. Maldonado-Denis v.\nCastillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581-582 (1st Cir.1994). For reasons that are not explained, Williams has not\nnamed either Suffolk County or the Suffolk County Sheriff as defendants in her ยง 1983 claim. Rather she has\nnamed the County on a theory of respondeat superior under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G.L. c. 258, ยง 1 \net al. The County has not moved for summary judgment, although under the Tort Claims Act liability extends only\nto ordinary and gross negligence, McNamara v. Honeyman, 406 Mass. 43, 46, 546 N.E.2d 139 (1989), or in\nsome cases to wanton and reckless conduct, Molinaro v. Northbridge, 419 Mass. 278, 279, 643 N.E.2d 1043\n(1995). The conduct of Sinclair and Thomas, on the other hand, is alleged to have been intentional. For such\nconduct, Suffolk County, as the public employer, is not liable. MacLean v. Delinsky, 407 Mass. 869, 878 n. 6, 556\nN.E.2d 60 (1990).\n[17] The grant of immunity also extends to the claims brought against Sinclair and Thomas under the MCRA as\nits immunity provisions are patterned after and consistent with federal ยง 1983 law. See Duarte v. Healy, 405\nMass. 43, 46-47, 537 N.E.2d 1230 (1989); Rodriques v. Furtado, 410 Mass. 878, 881-882, 575 N.E.2d 1124\n(1991).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
