The plaintiff was arrested on a two-year-old outstanding warrant for driving with an expired inspection sticker and for failing to appear in court. During intake, she was strip searched and, while naked, required to squat and cough. This procedure was repeated after a visit from her husband. She and her husband sued the officers involved, the county, the town and the sheriff.</p><p>Plaintiffs' motions for sanctions resulting from discovery disputes (and for default judgment against the county) were referred to the Magistrate (Mag. Judge Eugene W. Beaulieu) who recommended, and the Court (Judge George Z. Singal) agreed, that Defendants' counsel personally satisfy a $2500 sanction.</p><p>On  August 30, 1999, the Court (Judge Brody) granted Defendants' motions for summary judgment as to the Fourth Amendment claims, finding that the multiple strip searches were completely unjustified, but that none of the Defendants could be held liable, due to qualified immunity and the absence of municipal and supervisory liability. The Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs' pendent state claims. </p><p>On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the Court overturned the District Court's grant of summary judgment as to the arresting officer's liability, and held that factual issues regarding the Sheriff's involvement precluded summary judgment the claim against the County.

Lamoreau.\n[*]\nBefore TORRUELLA, Chief Judge, LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, and SCHWARZER,  Senior District Judge.\n10 *10 SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.\nThe pivotal issues before us are whether qualified immunity protected Rockport Officer Brent Davis when he\narrested plaintiff Carmen Miller on a restricted warrant and whether Sheriff Daniel Davey and Knox County can\nbe held liable for permitting her to be subjected to unreasonable strip searches.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nMiller's ordeal began on Saturday afternoon (of the three day Patriots' Day weekend), April 13, 1996, when Davis\nstopped her in Rockport, Maine, for driving with an expired inspection sticker. A routine warrant check disclosed a\ntwo-year-old outstanding warrant in Kennebec County for failure to appear in court and to pay a $235 fine. The\nRockport dispatcher relayed to Davis the information received from the Kennebec County dispatcher that the\nwarrant required Miller be taken \"before a judge immediately\" and that it specified $235 cash bail. Davis\nacknowledged the information. He then arrested Miller. He directed her to park her car in a nearby parking lot,\nplaced her six-year-old passenger in the front seat and Miller in the back seat of his police car, and proceeded to\nMiller's residence where he left the child with Miller's husband, Lawrence Miller. Lawrence Miller told Davis that\nthe fine had been paid and that he had a canceled check to prove it, but Davis did not wait and instead\nproceeded to the Knox County jail where Rockport detained arrestees.\nOn arrival at the jail, a sergeant from the Knox County Sheriff's Office spoke by phone with the Kennebec\ndispatcher who explained that \"on the top of the warrant, it says . . . this warrant to be executed by bringing\ndefendant immediately before a sitting Judge.\" The sergeant replied, \"So, he shouldn't [have] brought her to the\njail, he should've taken her to a judge.\" Davis then got on the phone. The dispatcher again told him, \"This warrant\nis to be executed by bringing defendant immediately before a sitting judge.\" Davis replied, \"Okay, I got, on mine,\nit's got Active warrant of arrest, then it says bail $235, to be taken to a judge.\" The dispatcher elaborated,\n\"They've got it printed in big letters on top of the actual warrant,\" and added that it \"means that it can only be\nexecuted Monday through Friday or unless you can find a Judge available today,\" and Davis acknowledged,\n\"Yeah, right.\" Though no party recollects the substance of the conversation, Davis claims he also spoke by phone\nwith Kennebec County Assistant District Attorney James Mitchell who advised him to detain Miller until Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, as part of the intake process at the jail, Carmen Miller was required to submit to a strip search and,\nwhile naked, to squat and cough. She was then placed into a cell adjacent to male inmates. After visits from her\nhusband and from her in-laws, she was again subjected to strip searches and required to squat naked and\ncough. On Monday, April 15, after several calls by Miller's attorney, her husband was permitted to bail her out.\nThe district court granted summary judgment for all defendants. Miller challenges the judgment dismissing her\nclaims (1) against Officer Davis, the Town of Rockport, Kennebec County, and Sheriff Bryan Lamoreau for\nwrongful arrest, and (2) against Sheriff Daniel Davey and Knox County for unreasonable searches. Jurisdiction\narises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Review of the summary judgment is de novo. See Whiting v. Kirk, 960 F.2d 248,\n251 (1st Cir.1992).\nDISCUSSION\nI. LIABILITY FOR WRONGFUL ARREST\nA. Officer Davis\nThe district court held that Davis was entitled to qualified immunity. The court assumed that it is clearly\n11 established that an arrest supported only by an arrest warrant must be conducted within the constraints *11 of\nthat warrant. It then held that the warrant in this case was ambiguous and that Davis acted reasonably in light of\nthe warrant's confusing commands. The court thought that the direction to \"bring[] defendant immediately before\na sitting judge\" contradicted the words in the body of the warrant directing the officer to \"arrest said defendant\nand bring her before the court.\" It also thought that the provision for bail suggested that the defendant could be\nbrought to jail rather than to the court. It noted that the disagreement between the Kennebec County dispatcher's\ninterpretation and that of Assistant District Attorney James Mitchell confirmed the warrant's ambiguity.\nOur analysis of a qualified immunity claim has two components. First, we ask whether \"the right asserted by the\nplaintiff was `clearly established' at the time of its alleged violation.\" Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 235 (1st\nCir.1990). If it was, we will \"assume that the right was recognized by the defendant officials.\" Id. Second, \"we will\ndeny the immunity claim if a reasonable officer situated in the same circumstances should have understood that\nthe challenged conduct violated that established right.\" Id. at 235-36; see also Napier v. Town of Windham, 187\nF.3d 177, 182 (1st Cir.1999).\nThe first prong of the analysis is readily dispatched. While there is no case law directly relating to arrest warrants,\nit is self-evident that a seizure conducted pursuant to an arrest warrant must conform to the terms of that warrant.\nCf. United States v. Upham, 168 F.3d 532, 536 (1st Cir.1999) (\"It is settled law that the search and seizure\nconducted under a warrant must conform to the warrant.\").\nTurning to the second prong, we see no ambiguity in this warrant nor can we find as a matter of law that Davis\nacted reasonably in executing it. The explicit direction that \"this warrant [is] to be executed by bringing defendant\nimmediately before a sitting judge\" told the arresting officer precisely the scope of the warrant and of his authority\nunder it. Moreover, taking into account the fact that it was not a felony warrant but a bail warrant for nonpayment\nof a fine with bail set at $235, a reasonably competent officer would not execute it by depositing an arrestee in jail\nfor a long weekend stay. That the restriction on this warrant may have been novel to Davis and the dispatcher\ndoes not alter our conclusion. A reasonable officer in Davis's position would have at least attempted to comply\nwith the warrant's terms by seeking out a judge, the county clerk, or the county bail commissioner. Davis made\nno attempt whatever. Instead, after having been repeatedly told by the dispatcher that the warrant required Miller\nto be taken before a judge immediately, he spoke with an assistant district attorney (the content of this\nconversation is unknown) who had never seen the warrant and did not know that Miller claimed to have paid the\nfine.\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Miller, there is a question of fact whether Davis's arrest and\ndetention of Miller on a warrant requiring that she be taken before a judge immediately was objectively\n\nreasonable. See Torres-Ramirez v. Bermudez Garcia, 898 F.2d 224, 228 (1st Cir.1990). Davis was therefore not\nentitled to qualified immunity.\nB. Kennebec County and Sheriff Bryan Lamoreau\nMiller contends that Kennebec County can be held liable for failing to train its personnel in the proper handling,\ninterpretation and verification of arrest warrants. The district court dismissed the claim against Kennebec County\nbecause no Kennebec employee inflicted a constitutional injury on Miller. We agree. Miller cannot prevail on a §\n1983 claim against a municipality \"absent a constitutional violation by its [employees].\" Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d\n1033, 1039-40 (1st Cir.1996). There is no evidence that training given by Kennebec County Sheriff Bryan\n12 Lamoreau *12 was constitutionally deficient. Kennebec County dispatcher Hatch did not cause an\nunconstitutional seizure of Miller because he offered the correct interpretation of the warrant. The most the\nevidence shows in this case is that Kennebec County personnel negligently failed to recall the warrant after the\nfine had been paid, but Miller does not contend that this omission rises to constitutional dimensions.\nMiller also seeks to impose liability on Kennebec County for the unreasonable advice allegedly given to Davis by\nAssistant District Attorney Mitchell. Because there is no evidence as to just what advice was given or that Mitchell\nhad the authority to act as a policy maker for the County, the claim was properly dismissed. See Monell v.\nDepartment of Social Services of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).\nC. Town of Rockport\nMiller claims that the Town of Rockport can be held liable for failing to train its police officers in the proper\nexecution of arrest warrants. Miller fails to offer any evidence, however, of an unlawful custom or of deliberate\nindifference that would bring her allegations within Monell, 436 U.S. at 690-95, 98 S.Ct. 2018, or City of Canton v.\nHarris, 489 U.S. 378, 388-89, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989).\nII. LIABILITY FOR STRIP SEARCHES\nA. Knox County\nThe district court found that there was ample evidence from which a jury could find that the repeated strip\nsearches to which Miller was subjected during her three-day detention in the Knox County jail were not justified\nby a reasonable suspicion that she was concealing contraband or weapons, particularly because the offense for\nwhich she was detained00failure to pay a fine00gave rise to no such suspicion. See Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1,\n97 97\n6 (1st Cir.1997). We agree. The court concluded, however, that none of the defendants could be held\nresponsible. It held that assuming Sheriff Davey was the policy maker responsible for the Knox County jail, there\nwas no evidence that he had actual knowledge that strip and body cavity searches were being conducted in\ncontravention of the County's written policy or that the practice was so widespread that Davey should have\nknown.\nMiller must meet two requirements to maintain a § 1983 claim grounded upon an unconstitutional municipal\ncustom or practice. First, the custom or practice must be attributable to the municipality, i.e., it must be \"so well\nsettled and widespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality can be said to have either actual or\nconstructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice.\" Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1156 (1st\nCir.1989). Second, the custom must have been the cause of and \"the moving force\" behind the deprivation of\nconstitutional rights. Id. at 1157.\nThere was sufficient evidence for a jury to find the existence of a practice to strip search arrestees without regard\nto whether there was a reasonable suspicion that they concealed weapons or contraband. Jeffrey Fuller, a\ncorrections officer assigned to the jail, testified without contradiction that, contrary to the County's written policy\nwhich conformed to constitutional standards, all arrestees unable to make bail are strip searched. Moreover,\n\nMiller's own experience being strip searched is undisputed by Knox County on summary judgment. See id. at\n1156 (\"Additional support for the existence of such a practice can be inferred from the event itself.\").\nAlthough there is no direct evidence that Sheriff Davey, as the responsible Knox County official, had actual\nknowledge of the jail's practice of strip searching all arrestees unable to make bail, his knowledge may be\n13 inferred. Miller offered undisputed evidence that the jail held no *13 more than 59 arrestees, that all persons\nunable to make bail were routinely strip searched regardless of whether they were suspected to have weapons or\ncontraband, and that she herself was strip searched repeatedly during her forty-eight hour detention. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise a triable issue that the strip search practice was \"so widespread or flagrant that in\nthe proper exercise of their official responsibilities, the municipal policy makers should have known of [it].\" Id. at\n1157 (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted). Moreover this practice of strip searching all\narrestees unable to make bail was the moving force behind the unreasonable searches of Miller. We agree with\nthe district court, and it is not disputed, that there was no reasonable suspicion that Miller was concealing\nweapons or contraband.\nB. Sheriff Davey\nTo impose supervisory liability on Davey, Miller must establish that his conduct or inaction amounts to \"reckless or\ncallous indifference\" of her constitutional rights and that an \"affirmative link\" existed between the constitutional\nviolation and his acts or omissions. Gutiérrez-Rodríguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir.1989). Because\nthe evidence is insufficient to meet that standard, we affirm the summary judgment for Davey.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment for Brent Davis and Knox County and remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. We vacate the order declining jurisdiction over the supplemental claims\nagainst those two defendants without prejudice. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.\nCosts to be assessed against Officer Davis and Knox County. See Fed.

Maine.\nAugust 30, 1999.\n76 *76 Dale Thistle, Newport, ME, for Plaintiff.\nWilliam Fisher, Portland, ME, for Kennebec Defendants.\nEdward Benjamin, Jr., Portland, ME, for Rockport Defendants.\nORDER AND MEMORANDUM OF DECISION\nBRODY, District Judge.\nThis civil rights action arises out of the arrest and subsequent incarceration of Plaintiff Carmen Miller (\"Ms.\nMiller\") in connection with an outstanding warrant for failure to appear and failure to pay a fine. Defendants are\nthe Town of Rockport and Rockport Police Officer Brent Davis; Kennebec County, Kennebec County Sheriff\n77 Bryan T. Lamoreau, and Jane Doe of Kennebec *77 County; and Knox County, Knox County Sheriff Daniel G.\nDavey, and Knox County Corrections Officer Jeffrey Fuller (\"Defendants\"). Ms. Miller and her husband, Lawrence\nMiller (\"Plaintiffs\"), allege generally that her arrest and imprisonment violated the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and\n[1]\nFourteenth Amendments of the Constitution as well as various provisions of state tort law.  Plaintiffs seek\ncompensation for pain and suffering, emotional distress, medical expenses, lost wages, and loss of consortium,\nas well as punitive damages and attorney's fees. Before the Court are two motions for summary judgment: one\nsubmitted by Davis and Rockport, the other filed on behalf of all other defendants. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, both Motions for Summary Judgment are GRANTED.\nI. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nSummary judgment is appropriate in the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact and when the moving\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). An issue is genuine for these purposes if \"the\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A material fact is one that has \"the\npotential to affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law.\" Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990\nF.2d 701, 703 (1st Cir. 1993). Facts may be drawn from \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). For the purposes of summary judgment,\nthe Court views the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See McCarthy v. Northwest\nAirlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir.1995).\nII. BACKGROUND\nOn April 13, 1996, the Saturday of the Patriot's Day long weekend, Ms. Miller was operating a motor vehicle with\nan expired inspection sticker on Route 90 in Rockport, Maine. She was stopped by Rockport Police Officer Brent\nDavis (\"Davis\") at 1:19 P.M. Davis radioed Rockport dispatch and requested that it run a check on Ms. Miller for\noutstanding warrants. According to the teletype printout for the Maine Wanted list received by Rockport\nDispatcher Jessika Tassinari (\"Tassinari\"), Ms. Miller had an outstanding arrest warrant in Kennebec County\n\n78 arising out of her failure to appear in court and failure to pay a fine.[2] In a telephone *78 conversation with\nTassinari, Kennebec County Dispatcher Kenneth Hatch (\"Hatch\") confirmed the existence of the warrant and\nadvised her that a notation on the top of the warrant indicated that it was to be executed \"by bringing the\n[3]\ndefendant immediately before a sitting judge.\"  Hatch told Tassinari that this notation meant that the person\nnamed in the warrant was subject to arrest Monday through Friday during the day.\nTassinari advised Davis by radio of the outstanding warrant and told him that the warrant required that Ms. Miller\n[4]\nbe taken \"before a judge immediately,\" and that it specified $235 cash bail.  Davis acknowledged receipt of\nTassinari's message and told her that he was taking Ms. Miller to the Knox County jail and that she should\nrequest Kennebec County to fax written confirmation of the outstanding warrant to that facility.\nAfter speaking with Tassinari, Davis informed Ms. Miller that she was under arrest for an unpaid fine. Davis\ndirected Ms. Miller to park her car in a nearby parking lot, then placed her, unhandcuffed, in the back seat of the\npolice car. Davis seated Ms. Miller's passenger, a young girl, in the front seat of the police car and proceeded to\nMs. Miller's residence where he dropped the child off with Ms. Miller's husband, Lawrence Miller (\"Mr. Miller\").\nDavis told Mr. Miller that his wife's arrest was based on an outstanding Superior Court warrant for failure to pay a\nfine. Mr. Miller told Davis that the fine had been paid and that he had the canceled check to prove it. Davis did not\nwait for Mr. Miller to produce the canceled check, but instead transported Ms. Miller to the Knox County Jail.\nSince the Town of Rockport (\"Rockport\") has no jail facilities of its own, persons arrested by Rockport police\nofficers are held at the Knox County jail. Davis claims that bail is handled by the Knox County Sheriff's Office.\nPlaintiffs dispute this and contend that bail is handled by a Bail Commissioner or by the Court.\nUpon arriving at the Knox County Jail, Davis had two conversations with Kennebec County Dispatcher Hatch. In\nthe first conversation, Hatch told Davis that the warrant could be executed only on Monday through Friday during\nthe day and that the subject must be brought before a sitting judge. Hatch admitted, however, that he was\nunfamiliar with this type of warrant and did not know its purpose. Hatch then consulted fellow dispatcher Mark\nGraham (\"Graham\") who said that in his one experience with this type of warrant, law enforcement waited to\n79 arrest the person during the week.[5] Davis told Keith *79 that he was considering contacting a Bail\nCommissioner to get further guidance.\nDuring his second call to Hatch, Davis asked for and was given contact numbers for several on-duty assistant\ndistrict attorneys in Kennebec County. Davis then phoned Kennebec County Assistant District Attorney James\nMitchell (\"ADA Mitchell\"), who advised Davis that Ms. Miller should remain in custody until a judge was available\n[6]\non the following Tuesday.  Davis did not tell ADA Mitchell that Mr. Miller claimed that the fine had been paid.\nDavis departed the Knox County jail at approximately 3:00 P.M. after speaking with ADA Mitchell, leaving Ms.\nMiller at the jail in the custody of the Knox County Sheriff's Department. Around this time, a Kennebec County\ndispatcher told Sargent Daniel of the Knox County Sheriff's Office that Ms. Miller's warrant indicated that she was\nto be taken directly to a judge. No one at the Knox County Jail called Desjardin, Clerk of the Kennebec County\nSuperior Court, for guidance as to the meaning of the warrant's language.\nLater that day, Mr. Miller arrived at the Knox County jail bearing the canceled check proving that his wife's fine\nhad been paid. He told an unidentified Knox County deputy that he had the canceled check and he was there to\nbail out his wife. The deputy told Mr. Miller that there was no bail regardless of the canceled check. Mr. Miller left,\nbut later called the Knox County jail and again attempted to arrange bail. An unidentified Knox County corrections\nofficer told him that his wife could not be freed on bail.\nAs part of the intake process at the Knox County jail, Ms. Miller was required to shower and submit to a strip\nsearch. While naked, Ms. Miller was further required to squat and cough. She then was placed in a maximum\nsecurity cell. Male inmates in the two adjoining cells taunted her throughout her stay. After a visit from her\nhusband and another from her in-laws, Ms. Miller was subjected to strip searches and required to squat and\ncough. The Policies and Procedures Manual of the Knox County Jail (\"Manual\") authorizes strip searches of pre-\ntrial inmates who are being held for murder, and Class A, B or C crimes or when there is reasonable suspicion to\nbelieve that an inmate is concealing contraband and is about to come in contact with other inmates of the facility.\n\nBody cavity searches are authorized only when there is probable cause to believe an inmate is concealing\ncontraband or evidence inside a body cavity, and then only with a warrant, unless there are exigent\ncircumstances. Jeffrey Fuller (\"Fuller\") was a corrections officer on duty at the Knox County jail on Saturday, April\n13, 1996. Daniel G. Davey (\"Davey\") was the Sheriff of Knox County during the time relevant to Plaintiffs' claims.\nFollowing several calls on Ms. Miller's behalf by Attorney Pamela Ames, Mr. Miller was allowed to bail out his wife\non Monday, April 15, 1996 with the condition that she appear in Kennebec County Superior Court the next day.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nAs specified above, Plaintiffs' Complaint asserts that Defendants violated Ms. Miller's rights under several\ndifferent constitutional amendments. In their (Corrected) Response to Defendants' Motions for Summary\nJudgment, however, Plaintiffs concede that \"for purposes of liability under Section 1983, this case should be\n80 analyzed under the Fourth amendment standards governing unreasonable searches *80 and seizures as applied\nto the States through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" ((Corrected) Resp. Defs.'\nMots. Summ. J. at 6.) The Court therefore will confine itself to an examination of the Fourth Amendment liability of\n(1) Davis and Rockport arising out of Ms. Miller's arrest, (2) Lamoreau, Jane Doe, and Kennebec County for their\nrole in Ms. Miller's arrest and incarceration at the Knox County Jail, and (3) Davey, Fuller, and Knox County for\nevents at the jail. Following its analysis of the Fourth Amendment claims, the Court briefly will address Plaintiffs'\ntort claims.\nA. Fourth Amendment\n1. Liability of Davis and Rockport\na. Davis\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons ... against\nunreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. Plaintiffs correctly assert that Ms. Miller was\nseized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when Davis informed her that she was under arrest, placed\nher in the back seat of a police car, and transported her to the Knox County Jail. They claim that this seizure was\nunreasonable because it contravened the arrest warrant specifying that the subject must be taken immediately\nbefore a judge.\nDavis contends that he acted reasonably on the basis of a facially valid arrest warrant and that, in any case, he is\nentitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable officer would not have known that what he was doing violated\nclearly established law.\nWhile objective reasonableness is the standard by which a court determines both substantive liability under the\nFourth Amendment and qualified immunity under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Supreme Court has recognized that a\npolice officer who violates the Fourth Amendment nevertheless may enjoy qualified immunity. See Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 643, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). In this case, since the Court is satisfied\nthat Davis is entitled to qualified immunity, it need not reach the question of whether his conduct constituted a\nFourth Amendment violation.\nTo assess a claim of qualified immunity a court must determine (i) whether the plaintiff has alleged the violation of\na clearly established right, and (ii) whether a reasonable, similarly situated defendant would have understood that\nthe challenged conduct violated that clearly established right. See Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1997); \nComfort v. Town of Pittsfield, 924 F.Supp. 1219, 1227 (D.Me.1996). Davis argues that a reasonable officer would\nnot have believed that an arrest of Ms. Miller was unreasonable under the circumstances. As evidence of the\nreasonableness of his conduct, Davis points to the undisputed fact that the arrest warrant for Ms. Miller was\nfacially valid. Davis also claims that the language of the arrest warrant itself was ambiguous. He contends that he\nacted reasonably in the face of such ambiguity by seizing Ms. Miller, consulting with ADA Mitchell as soon as\n\npossible after the seizure, and following his advice. Davis further claims that he was under no reasonable\nobligation to rely on the Kennebec County dispatcher's interpretation of the warrant.\nWhile \"an arrest executed pursuant to a facially valid warrant generally does not give rise to a cause of action,\" \nFair v. Fulbright, 844 F.2d 567, 569 (8th Cir.1988) (citing Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61\nL.Ed.2d 433 (1979)), Plaintiffs maintain that the seizure of Ms. Miller violated the Fourth Amendment because\nthat it exceeded the scope of the warrant. According to Plaintiffs, the warrant unequivocally mandated that Ms.\nMiller immediately be brought before a sitting judge. Because Davis was aware that there was no judge available\nuntil the Tuesday, his seizure of Ms. Miller on Saturday was unauthorized by the warrant and therefore\nunreasonable.\n81 *81 Plaintiffs provide no support for the proposition that arrests which exceed the scope of the warrant are per se\nunreasonable. Nevertheless, generalizing from case law concerning the execution of search warrants, the Court\nassumes that an arrest supported only by a warrant must be conducted within the constraints of that warrant. See\nUnited States v. Upham, 168 F.3d 532, 536 (1st Cir.1999) (observing that \"[i]t is settled law that the search and\nseizure conducted under a warrant must conform to the warrant\"). The Court does not accept, however, Plaintiffs'\nargument that the language on the particular warrant at issue in this case was unambiguous. For one thing, the\nheading of the warrant directing the arresting officer to \"bring[] defendant immediately before a sitting judge\"\narguably is contradicted by language in the body of the warrant commanding the officer to \"arrest said defendant\nand bring her before the court,\" as well as by language regarding bail which suggests that the defendant could be\nbrought to jail rather than to court. Moreover, the evidence indicates that even between Kennebec County\ndispatcher and ADA Mitchell there was disagreement as to the meaning of the warrant.\nFortunately, the Court does not need to construe the language of the warrant to decide the issue at hand. It is\nenough to find that when confronted with this ambiguity, Davis did everything a reasonable officer could be\nexpected to do. After confirming the existence of the warrant with Kennebec County via the Rockland dispatcher,\nDavis certainly was not unreasonable in rejecting the advice of the Kennebec County dispatcher and deciding to\ntake custody of Ms. Miller pending further clarification of the warrant's language since the dispatcher had no\nsupervisory authority over him and no legal training. Moreover, though Davis could have elected to wait at the\nMiller residence until Mr. Miller produced the canceled check, he was not unreasonable in declining to do so. See\nBaker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 145-46, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979) (finding that police officer\n\"executing an arrest warrant is not required to investigate every claim of innocence\"); Whiting v. Kirk, 960 F.2d\n248, 252 (1st Cir.1992). Davis also was not unreasonable in abiding by the advice of ADA Mitchell, the most\n[7]\nqualified person available to interpret the language of the warrant. See Arnsberg v. United States, 757 F.2d\n971, 981-82 (9th Cir.1985) (finding that \"it would be plainly unreasonable to rule that the arresting officers ... must\ntake issue with the considered judgment of an assistant United States Attorney and the federal magistrate\"); \nLavicky v. Burnett, 758 F.2d 468, 476 (10th Cir.1985) (\"If the sheriff's duty is unclear, it should be a defense that\nhe relied upon the advice of the prosecuting attorney's office.\"). Though Davis did not tell ADA Mitchell about Mr.\nMiller's claims that the fine had been paid and that he had the canceled check, Davis had not seen the check or\nany other document confirming Ms. Miller's claims of innocence when he spoke to Mitchell.\nThe First Circuit's opinion in Torres Ramirez v. Bermudez Garcia, 898 F.2d 224 (1st Cir.1990), cited by Plaintiffs,\ncan be distinguished on its facts. In Torres Ramirez, the First Circuit held that the district court did not err in\nfinding that the defendant was not entitled to qualified immunity because there was evidence that the defendant\nprocessed an arrest warrant that he knew or should have known had been vacated. See Torres Ramirez, 898\nF.2d at 228. Here, Davis had no reason to know that the warrant should have been recalled, nor had he reason to\nknow how it was to be executed.\n82 *82 The Supreme Court has held that qualified immunity is designed to protect \"all but the plainly incompetent or\nthose who knowingly violate the law\" from liability for money damages in civil rights actions. Hunter v. Bryant, 502\nU.S. 224, 229, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991). On the record in this case, no reasonable jury could find\nthat Davis knowingly violated the law when he arrested Ms. Miller nor could it characterize his actions as\nincompetent under the circumstances. The Court therefore grants Davis's Motion for Summary Judgment as to\n[8]\nCount III.\n\nb. Rockport\nA municipality may incur liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 when its official policies or customs cause a\nconstitutional deprivation. See Comfort v. Town of Pittsfield, 924 F.Supp. 1219, 1233 (D.Me. 1996). To prevail on\na municipal liability claim, a plaintiff must show (1) a municipal custom or policy, and (2) that this custom or policy\nwas \"the cause of and the moving force behind the deprivation of constitutional rights.\" Bordanaro v. McLeod,\n871 F.2d 1151, 1156 (1st Cir.1989). \"[T]he inadequacy of police training may serve as the basis for § 1983\nliability\" against a municipality but \"only where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights\nof persons with whom the police come in contact.\" City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103\nL.Ed.2d 412 (1989).\nAssuming for the sake of argument that Davis's arrest of Ms. Miller constituted a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment, Plaintiffs have presented no evidence whatsoever that Rockport promulgated any policy or tolerated\nany custom that encouraged or condoned unconstitutional arrests of this type by its police officers. There also is\nno evidence that such any such custom or policy, as opposed to the individual judgment exercised by Davis, was\nthe moving force behind the assumed constitutional deprivation. Likewise, beyond the bare fact that the arrest\noccurred, there is no evidence that Davis's training with respect to the execution of warrants was inadequate or\nresulted in the arrest of Ms. Miller. See Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1159-60 (1st Cir. 1989) (upholding\njury finding that city was liable for policy regarding training and supervision of police officers because \"jury was\nnot asked to infer the existence of this policy based solely on [the particular incident giving rise to the suit]\").\nRockport's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted as to Count II.\n2. Liability of Lamoreau, Jane Doe, and Kennebec County\nIt is undisputed that an employee of the Kennebec County Superior Court failed to recall the arrest warrant for\nMs. Miller after she paid her fine and that Kennebec County dispatchers as well as ADA Mitchell conferred with\nDavis as to the proper execution of the arrest warrant. There is no evidence, however, that any Kennebec County\n83 employee, including Jane Doe,[9] affected a Fourth Amendment *83 seizure of Ms. Miller. Because no employee\nof Kennebec County inflicted a constitutional injury on Ms. Miller, Plaintiffs' claims of supervisory and municipal\nliability against Kennebec County and its employees pursuant to section 1983 claim must fail. See City of Los\nAngeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 799, 106 S.Ct. 1571, 89 L.Ed.2d 806 (1986) (holding that municipality cannot be\nheld liable under Fourth Amendment if there is no underlying constitutional violation by individual officer); Evans\nv. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1039-40 (1st Cir.1996); Natal v. City of New Bedford, 37 F.Supp.2d 74, 75\n(D.Mass.1999) (\"If ... this Court grants [police officer's] summary judgment motion on the issue of liability rather\nthan qualified immunity, [plaintiff's] claims against the City and [the mayor and the chief of police] are moot.\").\nThe Court grants summary judgment in favor of Lamoreau and Jane Doe as to Count II and in favor of Kennebec\nCounty as to Count III.\n3. Liability of Fuller, Knox County, and Davey\nPlaintiffs allege that Ms. Miller's Fourth Amendment rights were violated when she was forced to endure multiple\nstrip searches and body cavity searches during her three day stay at the Knox County Jail. Defendants deny this\nallegation and argue, in the alternative, that if the searches did occur, they were constitutionally sound.\nThe First Circuit and other courts have recognized that strip searches and visual body cavity searches \"constitute\nan extreme intrusion upon personal privacy as well as an offense to the dignity of the individual.\" Wood v.\nClemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1996) (referring to strip searches); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\nCir.1997) (discussing strip searches and visual body cavity searches). For this reason, the Fourth Amendment\nrequires that \"strip and visual body cavity searches must be justified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the\narrestee is concealing contraband or weapons.\" Swain, 117 F.3d at 7. In the present case, there is ample\n\nevidence from which a jury could conclude that the strip and body cavity searches to which Ms. Miller was subject\nwhile in the custody of the Knox County jail were not supported by the requisite level of suspicion. Most\nsignificant is the fact that the nature of the offense for which Ms. Miller was detained 00 failure to pay a fine 00 gave\n97 97\njail personnel absolutely no grounds to suspect that she possessed contraband or weapons. The issue here,\nthen, is not whether the searches violated Ms. Miller's constitutional rights, but whether any of the defendants\n[10]\nnamed in the Complaint can be held responsible for the violation.  The Court finds that they cannot.\na. Fuller\nIn his deposition, Fuller acknowledges that he was working as a corrections officer at the Knox County Jail when\nMs. Miller was brought there on April 13, 1996. There is no evidence, however, that Fuller was personally\ninvolved in the strip search or visual body cavity search of Ms. Miller on that day at any other time during her\ndetention. There also is no allegation that Fuller participated in the searches in any type of supervisory capacity.\nThus, section 1983 provides no basis upon which to find Fuller liable for the deprivation of Ms. Miller's\n84 constitutional rights. The Court *84 grants summary judgment in favor of Fuller on Count IV.\nb. Knox County\nAs set forth above in Part III.A.1.b, a municipality is subject to liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 when its policies or\ncustoms cause a constitutional deprivation. To the extent that Plaintiffs' claim against Knox County is based on\nthe deposition testimony of Fuller that the Knox County Jail had a policy of strip searching anyone who could not\nmake bail, the Court finds that this policy (if it existed) is not attributable to Knox County.\nLiability for an unconstitutional policy or custom may be attributed to a municipality only if it is \"so well settled and\nwidespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality can be said to have either actual or constructive\nknowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice.\" Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1156 (1st Cir.1989).\nEven assuming that Davey could be classified as a policymaker for these purposes, there is no evidence that he\nhad actual knowledge that strip and body cavity searches were being conducted in contravention of Knox\nCounty's written policy and pursuant to the unwritten custom to which Fuller alludes. In addition, Plaintiffs have\nproduced no evidence of similar searches from which a jury could infer that \"`the practices have been so\nwidespread or flagrant that in the proper exercise of [his] official responsibilities [Davey] should have known of\nthem.'\" Id. (reciting standard for constructive knowledge) (quoting Spell v. McDaniel, 824 F.2d 1380, 1387 (4th\nCir.1987)); see also Altman v. Kelly, 36 F.Supp.2d 433, 435 (D.Mass.1999) (\"The law is exceedingly clear ... that\nsuch a policy or custom cannot be established on the basis of a single event alone.\") (citing Mahan v. Plymouth\nCounty House of Corrections, 64 F.3d 14, 16-17 (1st Cir.1995)).\nThe Court therefore grants summary judgment in favor of Knox County as to Count II.\nc. Davey\nDavey was the Sheriff of Knox County during the period relevant to Plaintiffs' claims. As supervisor of the Knox\nCounty Jail, Davey is potentially liable for constitutional violations perpetrated on pre-trial detainees such as Ms.\nMiller. To demonstrate a supervisor's liability under Section 1983 for the constitutional violation of a subordinate,\na plaintiff must show that (i) \"the supervisor's conduct or inaction amounts to either deliberate, reckless or callous\nindifference to the constitutional rights of others,\" and that (ii) \"an affirmative link exists between the street-level\nconstitutional violation and the acts or omissions of the supervisory officials.\" Comfort v. Town of Pittsfield, 924\nF.Supp. 1219, 1231 (D.Me.1996) (citing Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir.1989)).\nIn this case, Plaintiffs rely on the theory that employees were not adequately trained. Specifically they state,\n\"although Knox County has written policies with respect to strip searches in the jail, apparently staff was given no\n[11]\npractical training with respect to the application of those policies since they were not followed in this case.\"\n85 (Pls.'s Resp. Defs.'s Mot. *85 Summ. J. at 16.) Such an inference is entirely unwarranted. See Colon v. Rivera,\n846 F.Supp. 156, 162 (D.P.R.1993) (finding no supervisory liability for officers' use of force where there was no\n\nevidence of any prior civilian complaints against officers nor any other evidence that officers were prone to\nmisconduct). Plaintiffs not only have failed to adduce direct evidence concerning the training of the particular\nemployee or employees who performed the searches at issue, they have failed to put forth evidence tending to\nshow a deficiency in the training of any Knox County Jail employee. Without such evidence, a reasonable jury\ncould not possibly conclude that there was a causal link between the acts or omissions of Davey and the\nconstitutional violations.\n[12]\nThe Court grants summary judgment in favor of Davey as to Count III.\nB. Tort Claims\nPlaintiffs have asserted claims against one or more Defendants for negligence, negligent and intentional infliction\nof emotional distress, and loss of consortium. In light of the fact that the Court has granted summary judgment in\nfavor of Defendants on Plaintiffs' constitutional claims, the Court declines to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction\nover these remaining state law claims. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); see also Mercado-Garcia v. Ponce Federal\nBank, 979 F.2d 890, 896 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Once the court dismissed some of the federal claims and resolved the\nothers before trial by summary judgment, it had the discretion also to dismiss the pendent state claims.\"); \nMartinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 990 (1st Cir.1995) (\"once the court determined so far in advance of trial that no\nlegitimate federal question existed, the jurisdictional basis for plaintiff's pendent claims under Puerto Rico law\nevaporated\"). Plaintiffs may pursue these claims in state court.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, Defendant's Motions for Summary Judgment are GRANTED as to Counts II and\nIII. The Court declines to exercise its jurisdiction over the remaining state claims.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Plaintiffs' seven-count Complaint is not a model pleading. As far as the Court can determine, it asserts the\nfollowing claims: (1) negligence on the part of Davis, Lamoreau, Fuller, and Jane Doe (Count 1); (2) municipal\nliability on the part of Kennebec County, Knox County, and the Town of Rockport pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n(Count II); (3) violations by all Defendants of the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United\nStates Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count III); (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress by all\nDefendants (Count IV); (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress by all Defendants (Count V); (6) loss of\nconsortium (Count VI); and (7) a violation by all Defendants of the Maine Civil Rights Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. title\n5, § 4681 (Count VII). \nThe Court notes in passing that while the Plaintiffs' Complaint refers to the \"City of Rockport,\" Rockport is\napparently a town. (Davis & Rockport Mot. Summ. J. Ex. G.)\n[2] In 1988, Ms. Miller was convicted of operating under the influence and was ordered to pay a fine of $350.00\nwithin 90 days of the date of her sentencing. As of May 18, 1994, Ms. Miller had failed to pay some $235 of that\nfine. On that date, Kennebec County Superior Court issued a Motion and Order to Appear, a copy of which was\nsent to Ms. Miller by regular mail. Ms. Miller claims that she never received this order and that it was returned to\nthe Kennebec County Superior Court and is currently in her file. In any event, Ms. Miller failed to appear at the\nJune 1994 hearing as directed by the Order and a warrant for her arrest was issued on September 13, 1994. \nOn March 24, 1995, the Kennebec County Superior Court issued a second Motion and Order to Appear ordering\nMs. Miller to appear in court on April 25, 1995. Ms. Miller paid the outstanding balance of the fine on April 20,\n1995. The Kennebec County Superior Clerk's Office, however, failed to recall the warrant. Thus, as of April 13,\n1996, there existed a facially valid warrant for Ms. Miller's arrest.\nNancy Desjardins, Clerk of the Kennebec County Superior Court, was named as a defendant in this case. By\norder dated June 22, 1998, the Court granted Desjardins unopposed Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n[3] The words \"this warrant to be executed by bringing defendant immediately before a sitting judge\" do, in fact,\nappear in capital letters and bold type across the top of the warrant. The body of the warrant directs law\nenforcement to \"arrest said defendant and bring her before the court, forthwith at Kennebec County, so that s/he\nmay show cause why s/he should not be sentenced to be imprisoned for nonpayment.\" The bottom of the warrant\ncontains the following notation with respect to bail: \"$235 cash only, (defendant to contact court.)\" (Statement of\nMaterial Facts in Support of Mot. Summ. J. by Knox and Kennebec County Defs. Ex. A-2.)\n[4] Plaintiff claims that Tassarini told Davis exactly what Hatch told her, that is, that the warrant could be executed\nonly during the day on Monday through Friday. The transcript of the conversation between Tassarini and Davis\nreveals, however, that Tassarini relayed to Davis only that \"according to the paperwork at Kennebec, as soon as\nthat paperwork is served the subject needs to be brought before a Judge immediately.\" (Pls.' Resp. Ex. C at call\n1.)\n[5] Kennebec County Sheriff Bryan T. Lamoreau (\"Lamoreau\") was the sheriff of Kennebec County at all times\nrelevant to these events. Lamoreau has at least some responsibilities with respect to the training of dispatchers.\nThere are no training manuals for Kennebec County dispatchers concerning the execution of warrants.\n[6] Shortly before or after his conversation with Davis, ADA Mitchell told a Kennebec County dispatcher that he\nbelieved the phrase \"be brought immediately before a judge\" printed on the warrant meant \"immediately within a\nreasonable time period.\"\n[7] Plaintiffs cite Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991) to support the proposition\nthat police misconduct is not immunized from liability even when it is based on erroneous legal advice. The issue\nin Burns, however, was whether a prosecutor was entitled to absolute or qualified immunity from liability for\nerroneous advice he gave police. See Burns, 500 U.S. at 496, 111 S.Ct. 1934.\n[8] The Court also grants summary judgment in favor of Davis on Count I to the extent that it states a Fourth\nAmendment claim for the use of excessive force since Ms. Miller herself admits that she was not so much as\nhandcuffed during the arrest. \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs have not provided evidence that Davis had the power or the responsibility to arrange bail for\nMs. Miller, nor have they explained how a denial of bail might constitute a Fourth Amendment violation.\n[9] The Court also has no personal jurisdiction over Jane Doe as Plaintiffs have not made any progress in\nlocating or serving her in the 16 months since this suit was filed. See Figueroa v. Rivera, 147 F.3d 77, 82-83 (1st\nCir.1998) (\"under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m), a district court may dismiss a complaint without prejudice as to a particular\ndefendant if the plaintiff fails to serve that defendant within 120 days after filing the complaint\"); Glaros v. Perse,\n628 F.2d 679, 685 (1st Cir.1980) (holding that district court prepared to act on dispositive motions is not \"obliged\nto wait indefinitely for [plaintiff] to take steps to identify and serve `unknown' defendants\").\n[10] Though the deadline for completion of discovery in this case was April 20, 1999, Plaintiffs have failed to\npresent any evidence as to the identity of the person or persons who conducted the strip and body cavity\nsearches of Ms. Miller. For purposes of deciding these motions, however, the Court is willing to infer that whoever\nconducted the searches was an unidentified Knox County employee, but the Court cannot impose liability for a\nclear violation of constitutional rights when there is no evidence presented us as to who violated those rights.\n[11] At least insofar as they were applicable to Ms. Miller, the Court finds constitutional Knox County's policy on\nstrip and body cavity searches. The Knox County Policy and Procedure Manual provides in relevant part: \n3. Strip searches will NOT be conducted at the time of arrest or admission on pretrial inmates charged with class\nD, E, or other misdemeanor offense unless the officer has REASONABLE SUSPICION to believe that an inmate\nis concealing contraband and is about to come in contact with other inmates of the facility....\n4. BODY CAVITY SEARCHES, other than searches of the mouth, shall be conducted in compliance with the\nfollowing rules:\n\na. ONLY when authorized by the Jail Administrator when there is PROBABLE CAUSE to believe an inmate is\nconcealing inside a bady [sic] cavity contraband or evidence of a crime; and\nb. Conducted pursuant to a warrant issued upon probable cause. The warrant may be dispensed with, however,\nin cases of consent (in writing or witnessed by two officers), or exigent circumstances;\n(Pls.'s Statement of Material Facts Ex. D.)\n[12] Since Plaintiffs have articulated no legal theory whatsoever as to how the failure of Knox County to release\nMs. Miller on bail violated her Fourth Amendment rights, the Court declines to speculate on this issue.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
