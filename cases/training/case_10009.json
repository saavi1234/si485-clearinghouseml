      "text": "602 F.Supp. 124 (1984)\nFrances KATHRINER, Plaintiff,\nv.\nCITY OF OVERLAND, MISSOURI, et al., Defendants.\nNo. 82-1579-C (4).\nUnited States District Court, E.D. Missouri, E.D.\nSeptember 4, 1984.\n125 *125 Alan E. DeWoskin, St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff.\nNorman A. Selner, Selner, Glaser, & Komen, St. Louis, Mo., for defendants.\nORDER\nCAHILL, District Judge.\nThis matter is before the Court on defendants' motion for a new trial and stay of execution.\nThe central issue in this 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 action was the constitutionality of plaintiff Frances Kathriner's being\nstrip searched pursuant to the policy of the City of Overland. Defendants Poeschel, Nelson, and Myers were\nbefore the Court because of their part in implementing this policy. The policy complained of, strip searching all\ndetainees without regard to probable cause for such a search, was in effect on March 10, 1980, when Kathriner's\ncause of action arose.\nThe City of Overland's policy of strip searching all persons to be detained in a cell, regardless of how short the\ndetention period and regardless of whether probable cause existed to believe that person may possess\ncontraband or weapons, violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. While\nthe City of Overland may detain any person charged with any crime or ordinance violation, it may not strip search\nthose persons charged only with misdemeanors or ordinance violations unless there is reasonable cause to\nbelieve that such detainees possess weapons or contraband. Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.1979),\naff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983).\nBecause strip searches are a particularly demeaning invasion of privacy they must only be used when less\nintrusive means of discovering weapons or contraband cannot be used and the particular circumstances warrant\nsuch a search. In the case at bar the evidence shows, and the defendants admit, that no one believed Frances\nKathriner to possess contraband or weapons. Neither did the particular circumstance of her arrest and detention\nwarrant such an intrusive search. Furthermore, the Court found that Kathriner's strip search was distinguishable\nfrom the strip search of federal pretrial detainees after contact visits, held constitutional in Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Accordingly, because the City of Overland cannot assert the\ndefense of good faith immunity, Owen v. City of Independence, Mo., 445 U.S. 622, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d\n673 (1980), plaintiff's motion for a directed verdict against the City of Overland was granted.\nQualified or good faith immunity generally shields public officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their\nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The law, however, was\nnot clearly established at the time of plaintiff's strip search. At the time of plaintiff's arrest and strip search on\nMarch 10, 1980, the most recent applicable pronouncement of law was that of the United States Supreme Court\nin Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In Bell the Supreme Court held that visual\nbody cavity strip searches at a detention facility could be conducted on less than probable cause despite the\n126 significant *126 privacy interests of the inmates. 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. At first glance this holding\nappears consistent with the defendants' policy of strip searching all persons to be detained in a cell and would\n\nnot have put the City on notice that their policy was unconstitutional. Insofar as defendants Poeschel and Myers'\nconduct did not violate clearly established rights and the plaintiff had neither alleged nor submitted evidence that\nthey had a malicious intent to deprive her of her rights, they were shielded from liability by good faith immunity.\nAccordingly, defendants Poeschel's and Myers' motion for a directed verdict was granted.\nOn the other hand, plaintiff alleged, and arguably the evidence supported, that defendant Nelson intended to\npunish her. The Court, for purposes of this motion, interpreted this allegation as a charge that Nelson intended to\ndeprive plaintiff of her rights or otherwise injure her. The question of defendant Nelson's subjective intent was left\nfor the jury, which decided in his favor.\nThe Court has reviewed the defendants' arguments in support of a new trial and denies them on their merits. The\nCourt does not find, as suggested by the plaintiff, that this motion is untimely. The motion was mailed to the\nplaintiff on the tenth day after judgment. \"Service by mail is complete upon mailing.\" Fed.R. Civ.P. 5. Accordingly,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that defendants' motion for a new trial is DENIED.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants' motion to stay execution of the judgment pending consideration of\nthe motion for a new trial is DENIED as MOOT.\nSO ORDERED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
