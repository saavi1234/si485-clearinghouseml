    "summary": "<p>On May 5, 2006, an individual who had been arrested on a minor criminal charge filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Mercer County Sheriff's Department had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all individuals who entered the Mercer County Jail, regardless of the criminal charge or absence of reasonable suspicion. Plaintiffs claimed that the practice violated the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary and punitive damages, and class certification on behalf of thousands of similarly situated individuals. The County and the Sheriff answered by generally denying the allegations.</p><p>The case was assigned to Chief Judge Garrett E. Brown, Jr., who referred the case to Magistrate Judge Tonianne J. Bongiovanni to oversee discovery.  On August 2, 2007, Magistrate Judge Bongiovanni referred the case to mediation and stayed all proceedings. </p><p>In November 2008, a settlement agreement was finalized between the parties and given preliminary approval by Judge Bongiovanni. On April 20, 2009, Judge Bongiovanni released an order granting final approval of the class action settlement. The settlement provided that the case be dismissed with prejudice and the claims against the defendants be dropped in exchange for a settlement amount of $1.8 million for plaintiff and those of his class. Plaintiff himself was to receive $20,000 for the trouble he took to bring the lawsuit; the rest of his class was to receive a pro rata share of the settlement fund; plaintiff attorneys received $540,000 in attorney fees. </p><p>Additionally, Mercer County asserted that it changed its policy on strip searches on August 17, 2006, as a result of this litigation. The new policy ended the practice of strip searching detainees on a blanket basis, as well as the practice of strip searching non-indictable detainees in the absence of reasonable suspicion. Mercer County further asserted that beginning on August 17, 2006, all corrections officers had been trained in the new policy. </p>",

Lesser, one of the Class Counsel, in support of the Settlement, having received \nevidence at the hearing, having heard arguments from Class Counsel and the Defendants, \nand having considered all matters heretofore had in this case, now makes the following: \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1.  This action was commenced on May 5, 2006, as a class action. \n\n'  '  Case 3:06-cv-02065-TJB   Document 44   Filed 04/20/09   Page 2 of 8 PageID: 365\n2.  After  several  years  of intensive  litigation,  including  extensive  discovery  and \nmotion practice, and as a result of intensive, arm's length negotiations between Class \nCounsel  and  Defendants,  including  settlement conferences  before  former  Magistrate \nJudge Joel  Rosen,  the parties have reached  accord with respect to a Settlement that \nprovides substantial benefits to Settlement Class Members, in return for a release and \ndismissal  of the  claims  at  issue  in  this  case  against  the  Defendants  (\"Settlement \nAgreement\").  The resulting Settlement Agreement was preliminarily approved by the \nCourt on November 20, 2008. \n3.  As  part of the  Order  Granting  Preliminary  Approval,  this Court approved  a \nproposed  Notice  Plan  and  Class Notice,  which  provided  Settlement Class  Members \nnotice of the proposed settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an opportunity for Class \nMembers to  file  objections to  the  Settlement,  and  an  opportunity to  opt-out of the \nSettlement. \n4.  As of the deadline for the filing of objections, no objections were filed.  Given the \nsize of this Settlement, and the Notice Plan described above, this Court finds that the \ncomparatively low number of objections is indicative of the fairness, reasonableness and \nadequacy of the Settlement with the Defendants.  Following the deadline date, a single \nobjection,  not  filed  or  served  in  compliance  with  the  Order  Granting  Preliminary \nApproval and the terms of the Notice, was received from a Class Member who did not \nprovide any substantive basis for his objection, only that he thought he should receive a \ngreater amount. \n5.  Class Counsel has filed with the Court an affidavit from The Garden City Group \ndeclaring that the mailing of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan, \n\nCase 3:06-cv-02065-TJB   Document 44   Filed 04/20/09   Page 3 of 8 PageID: 366\nhas been completed. \n6.  The  Court finds  that the published notice,  mailed notice and  Internet posting \nconstitute the best practicable notice of the Fairness Hearing, proposed Settlement, Class \nCounsel's application for  fees  and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class \nNotice and Short Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient \nnotice to all members of the Settlement Class, and complied fully with the requirements \nof Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, \nthe laws of New Jersey and any other applicable law. \n7.  Any  persons who  wished  to  be  excluded  from  this action were  provided an \nopportunity to \"opt-out\" pursuant to the Notice.  One individual has excluded himself, \nHerman Smith. \n8.  Settlement Class Members, aside from Mr. Herman Smith are bound by the: \nSettlement, Settlement Agreement, releases contained within the Settlement Agreement, \nand the Final Order and Judgment.  Settlement Class Members do not have a further \nopportunity to opt-out of this Action. \n9.  Any Class Member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to \nthe Settlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiffs \nClass  Counsel's  application  for  fees,  costs,  and  expenses,  in  accordance  with  the \nprocedure set forth in the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary \nApproval  of Settlement,  is  deemed  to  have  waived  any  such  objection  by  appeal, \ncollateral attack, or otherwise. \n10.  On the  basis of all  of the  issues  in this  litigation,  and  the provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable \n\n'  '  Case 3:06-cv-02065-TJB   Document 44   Filed 04/20/09   Page 4 of 8 PageID: 367\nand adequate compromise of the claims against the Defendants in this case, pursuant to \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the \nCourt has considered in affirming this Settlement, including: \na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nb.  This Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class Members now, \nwithout  further  litigation,  under  circumstances  where  the  liability  issues  are  still \nvigorously contested among the parties to this litigation and among the parties to the \nindividual  litigation.  This  Settlement  provides  Class  Members  with  a  substantial \nmonetary benefit. \nc.  This Settlement is clearly a product of hard-fought litigation between the \nparties, and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or Counsel for the \nDefendants. \n11.  The  claims  procedure  established  under  the  Settlement  Agreement  is  fair,  a \nsimplified process, and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work \nout any unanticipated problems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS \nOF  FACT  AND  THE  COURT  HEREBY  MAKES  THE  FOLLOWING \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW: \n12.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  and  the  subject  matter  of this \nproceeding. \n13.  Pursuant to  Rule  23  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  the  following \nSettlement Class is certified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll persons who were placed into the custody of the Mercer County Correctional \nFacility after being charged with disorderly person's offenses, violations of Title 39 \n(traffic  offenses),  Municipal  Ordinance  infractions  and  other  non-indictable \n\nCase 3:06-cv-02065-TJB   Document 44   Filed 04/20/09   Page 5 of 8 PageID: 368\noffenses  and  were  strip  searched  upon  their  entry  into  the  Mercer  County \nCorrectional  Facility  pursuant to  the  custom  and  practice  of the  Mercer County \nSheriffs Department and the County of Mercer. The class period commences on May \n5, 2004 and extends until August 17, 2006.  Specifically excluded from the class are \nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees.  For purposes of class defmition, multiple entries \ninto the Facility shall be viewed as a single entry. \n12.  The Court finds that, for the purpose ofthis Settlement, the requirements of Rule \n23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a class action is an \nappropriate method for resolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for \nclass certification under Rule 23 are present.  The Class Members are ascertainable and \ntoo numerous to be joined.  Questions of law and fact common to all Class members \npredominate over individual issues and should be determined in one proceeding with \nrespect to all Class members.  The Class Representative's claims are typical of those of \nthe Class.  The Class action mechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating \nand resolving this action. \n13.  The  Settlement Class  Representative,  Trafford  Boiselle,  is  entitled  to  and  is \nhereby awarded a payment of $20,000, in recognition of the efforts he undertook in \nconnection  with  this  lawsuit.  All  Class  Members  who  have  made  claims  on  the \nsettlement  are  entitled  to  receive  their pro  rata  share  of the  settlement  fund  after \nadministrative expenses, attorneys' fees and expenses, and incentive awards are deducted \nfrom the fund. \n14.  Class Counsel are  qualified,  experienced,  and  have aggressively  litigated this \ncase, thereby demonstrating their adequacy as counsel for the Settlement Class.  Seth \nLesser, Esquire, of Klafter Olsen &  Lesser, LLP, Rye Brook, New York;  Charles J. \nLaDuca, Esquire, of Cuneo Gilbert &  LaDuca, LLP,  Washington, DC; Elmer Robert \nKeach, III, of the Law Offices of Elmer Robert Keach, III, Amsterdam, New York; and \n\n. \n' \nCase 3:06-cv-02065-TJB   Document 44   Filed 04/20/09   Page 6 of 8 PageID: 369\nWilliam A. Riback of William Riback, LLC, are hereby appointed as Counsel for the \nSettlement Class.  11. Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendants \ntheir application for reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses consistent with the \nterms of the Settlement Agreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request \nand hereby grants the request.  The Court finds that final approval of attorneys' fees in \nthe amount of $540,000 is warranted.  The Court finds that this amount is justified by the \nwork performed, skill, risks taken and the results achieved by Class Counsel.  The Court \nalso finds that approval of the $19,236.49 attorneys' costs application is warranted, based \non Plaintiffs counsel's out-of-pocket expenses as demonstrated by the Certification of \nSeth R. Lesser and that approval of payment of such other incidental expenses, not to \nexceed $500, as may have been incurred or will be incurred in connection with the Final \nApproval Hearing and the finalization of the Settlement is also warranted. \n15.  The Court finds that the payment of the incurred and anticipated expenses ofthe \nClaims Administrator, the Garden City Group, as set forth in the Certification of Seth R. \nLesser is reasonable and justified. \n16.  The  Court grants  final  approval  of the  Settlement Agreement,  as  being  fair, \nreasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS \nOF  FACT  AND  CONCLUSIONS  OF  LAW,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED, \nADJUDGED AND DECREED AS FOLLOWS: \n1.  The motion for Final Approval of the proposed Settlement is GRANTED. \n2.  The  Settlement Class  Representative,  Trafford  Boiselle,  is  entitled  to  and  is \nhereby awarded a payment of $20,000 in recognition of the efforts he undertook in \n\n•  •  '  J  Case 3:06-cv-02065-TJB   Document 44   Filed 04/20/09   Page 7 of 8 PageID: 370\nconnection with this lawsuit. All Class Members who have made claims on the settlement \nare entitled to receive their pro rata share of the settlement fund after administrative \nexpenses, attorneys' fees and expenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the fund. \n3.  The Class Counsel's application for attorneys' fees and expenses is granted in the \namount of$540,000 in fees and $19,236.49 for expenses, as well as such other incidental \nexpenses,  not  to  exceed  $500,  as  may  have  been  incurred  or  will  be  incurred  in \nconnection with the Final Approval Hearing and finalization of the Settlement and the \nClaims Administrator is ordered upon Final Approval to pay such amounts to Seth R. \nLesser ofKlafter Olsen & Lesser LLP for disbursement to the Class Counsel's law firms. \n4.  The costs and expenses incurred to date or hereafter incurred for finalization of \nthe Settlement by the Claims Administrator, estimated to be $500,000, but not to exceed \n$525,000 without leave of Court and subject to approval by Class Counsel, are granted \nfor payment and the Garden City Group can disburse to itself from the Settlement funds \nsuch funds, upon approval by Class Counsel. \n4.  This Action and all claims against the Settling Defendant are hereby dismissed \nwith prejudice, but the Court shall retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction of the \nAction, all Parties, and Settlement Class Members, to interpret and enforce the terms, \nconditions and obligations of this Settlement Agreement. \n5.  All Class Members who have not timely filed an opt-out request are barred and \nenjoined from commencing and/or prosecuting any claim or action against the \n\n•  \"  '  I  Case 3:06-cv-02065-TJB   Document 44   Filed 04/20/09   Page 8 of 8 PageID: 371\nDefendants.

For at least the  past 2  years,  the  Mercer County \nSheriffs Department and Mercer County Department of Corrections have had a policy of \nstrip-searching all individuals who enter the Mercer County Jail and are placed in jail \nclothing, regardless of the crime upon which they are charged.  Upon information and \nbelief, this policy is, in part, derived from the written procedures of the Mercer County \nSheriffs  Department  and  Mercer  County  Department  of  Corrections,  and  was \npromulgated by senior Department officials; specifically, Defendants Kevin C.  Larkin, \nMichael D. Gerasimowicz, Dennis J. Tobolski, Michael B. Gerald, John A. Kemler, John \nJ. McEwan, Shirley Tyler and Roy Hendrick \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged  with  misdemeanors  or  minor  violations  cannot  be  strip-s.earched  absent \nparticularized suspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of \nMercer County and the Mercer County Sheriffs Department to force those charged with \nminor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Mercer \nCounty Jail is clearly illegal. \nTrafford Boisselle bring this action on behalf of himself, and on behalf of a class \nof thousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to \nvindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their civil rights and those of the class \nmembers  they  propose  to  represent.  Plaintiff was  charged  with  misdemeanor  and \nviolation  offenses,  and  subject  to  a  strip  search,  in  violation  of his  right  against \n2 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1 - T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P3a ogfe 2 32 (cid:10)of 22\nunreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \nPlaintiff seeks monetary damages for himself and each member of the proposed class, a \ndeclaration that the  Sheriffs Department's  and  Correction's Department policies  are \nunconstitutional,  and  an  injunction  precluding  Mercer  County,  Mercer  County \nCorrections and the Mercer County Sheriffs Department from continuing to violate the \nrights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiff Trafford \nBoisselle complains as follows: \nJURISDICTION \nI.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§§  1331,  1341  &  1343  because  it is  filed to  obtain compensatory damages,  punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C.  §§  1981  &  1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.

Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b) (I), 23(b )(2) and 23(b )(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals who were charged with misdemeanors (disorderly persons offenses) or minor \ncrimes and were strip searched upon their entry into the Mercer County Jail. \n17. The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nMercer County Jail after being charged with non indictable offenses \nsuch as misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, \ntraffic infractions, civil commitments, warrants for child support or \nother minor crimes and were or will be strip searched upon their \nentry into the Mercer County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and \npractice of the Mercer CoUI1ty Sheriffs Department and the County \nof Mercer.  The  class  period  commences  on  May  5,  2004  and \nextends  to  the  date  on  which  the  Mercer  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment  and/or  the  County  of Mercer  are  enjoined  from,  or \notherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom of conducting  strip  searches  absent reasonable  suspicion. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all \nof their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, \nemployees or assignees. \n18. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n19. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors, \ntraffic warrants child support and other violations which do not support probable cause to \nsearch, who are placed into the custody of the Mercer County Jail every month - all of \nwhom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the \nproposed class totals at least 5,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights \nviolated on multiple occasions. \n8 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1 - T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P9a ogfe 2 92 (cid:10)of 22\n20. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the  large  number of class members  and  the  fact  that  class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Mercer County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon \ninformation and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may not \nspeak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n21. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants' \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Mercer \nCounty Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the established law in this \njudicial circuit. \n22. Plaintiff's  claims  are  typical  of the  claims  of the  members  of the  Class. \nPlaintiff and  all  members of the  class  sustained  damages  arising  out of Defendants' \n·course of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n23. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff \nhas no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n24. Plaintiff has retained counsel who have substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiff is being \nrepresented by William Riback; Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & \nLaDuca, LLP; Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Locks Law Firm, PLLC; Elmer Robert \n9 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a0g oef  1202 (cid:10)of 22\nKeach, III; and Gary E.  Mason, Alexander E.  Barnett and Nicholas, Migliaccio of The \nMason Law Firm, PLLC. \n25. William Riback is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who \nhas successfully litigated class actions in both state and federal  courts in a number of \njurisdictions across the country. \n26. Jonathan W. Cuneo and Charles J. LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, \nhave  extensive  experience  in state  and  federal  trial  and appellate  courts,  before  law \nenforcement authorities and in proceedings before the United States Congress.  Cuneo \nand  LaDuca  have  successfully  prosecuted  complex  class  actions,  including  cases \ninvolving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer protection and products liability \nin state and federal courts throughout the United States. In addition to this experience, \nCuneo and LaDuca are co-counsel in several strip-search class actions, with Mr. Keach, \none of which was recently certified in the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of New York against the County of Schenectady and other related Defendants. \n27. Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Locks Law Firm with offices in Cherry \nHill and New York City, are both experienced civil rights and class action attorneys.  Mr. \nLesser is one of this country's premier class action attorneys having successfully litigated \ncivil rights, consumer protection and products liability class actions against Fortune 500 \ncompanies  in courts across the  country, including both New Jersey state and  federal \ncourts. Ms. Rudich has litigated scores of individual and class action civil rights cases \nagainst a number of Defendants in over ten jurisdictions throughout the United States. \n28. Mr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who has \nlitigated a wide variety of civil rights actions, and has litigated class action lawsuits in \nstate and federal courts in five states.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated strip search \n10 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a1g oef  1212 (cid:10)of 22\ncases against the Troy City Police Department and the Schenectady School District, and \nwas lead counsel in the Rensselaer County Jail strip search class action which recently \nsettled. \n29. Gary E.  Mason is one of this country's premier class action attorneys, with \noffices in Washington, DC.  Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against \nFortune  500 companies in both state and  federal  court in over a dozen jurisdictions, \nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of \n$ 950 million dollars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high \nprofile class actions,  including  In Re The Exxon Valdez,  In Re  Diet  Drugs  Product \nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation. \n30. In  short,  Plaintiff's  counsel  has  the  resources,  expertise  and  experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against Mercer County, the Mercer County Sheriffs \nDepartment, Department of Corrections and the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for \nPlaintiff knows of no conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and \nmembers of the class. \n31. This  action,  in part,  seeks declaratory and  injunctive relief.  As  such, the \nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Mercer County \nJail.  In short, the County of Mercer, the Mercer County Sheriffs Department, the Policy \nMaking  Defendants  and  Gloucester  County  Corrections  Officers  acted  on  grounds \ngenerally applicable to all class members. \n32. In  addition  to  certification  under  Rule  23(b )(2),  and  m  the  alternative, \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n11 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a2g oef  1222 (cid:10)of 22\n33. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants' written and/or de facto policy of strip \nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to \nthe Mercer County Jail is a violation of.the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de facto  policy existed \nduring the class period. \n34. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over a  large  geographical  area.  Furthermore,  the  expense  and  burden  of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass  to  redress  the wrongs  done  to  them.  The  cost  to  the  federal  court· system  of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also  magnify the  delay  and  expense to  all  parties  and  the  court  system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n35. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the past 2 \nyears. \n12 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a3g oef  1232 (cid:10)of 22\n36. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n37. The  Fourth  Amendment  of the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  in· this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers  they  supervise,  from  performing  strip  searches  of arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged  with  misdemeanors  (disorderly persons  offenses)  other minor crimes,  traffic \noffenses, warrants for child support, or other non-indictable offenses, unless the officer \nhas  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  arrestee  is  concealing  a  weapon  or \ncontraband. \n38. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  County  of Mercer,  the  Mercer  County \nSheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or \nde facto  policy,  custom  or practice  of strip  searching  all  individuals  who  enter  the \ncustody of the Mercer County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the \nnature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n39. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  County  of Mercer,  the  Mercer  County \nSheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or \nde facto  policy, custom or practice of conducting visual  body cavity searches (visual \ninspection of the vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of \nthe Mercer County Jail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their \ncharged crime.  For purposes of this  Complaint,  strip  and visual cavity searches are \ncollectively referred to as \"strip searches.\" \n13 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a4g oef  1242 (cid:10)of 22\n40. The  County  of Mercer,  the  Mercer  County  Correctional  Facility  and  the \nMercer County Sheriff's Department, and the Policy Making Defendants know that they \nmay not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy or practice of conducting \nstrip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion.  Upon information and belief, \nthe Mercer County's written policy was based on the policy promulgated by the Mercer \nCounty Sheriff's Department or the Correctionallnstitution. \n4!. The  Defendants'  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n42. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n43. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  County  of Mercer,  the  Mercer  County \nSheriff's  Department  Mercer  County  Department  of Corrections  and  Policy  Making \nDefendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written \nand/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all individuals placed into the \ncustody of the Mercer County Jail and placed into jail clothing without any requirement \nof reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto \npolicy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the \noffense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular \narrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip \nsearches. \n14 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a5g oef  1252 (cid:10)of 22\n44. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy,  each member of the Class, \nincluding every named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Mercer County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable  suspicion,  and  in fact  were  not supported  by  reasonable \nsuspiciOn.  Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \noffenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n45. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches-\neach member of the class, including every named Plaintiff - has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \nA  TRAFFORD BOIS SELLE \n46. Trafford Boisselle was arrested on  January 2, 2006 on open warrants relating \nto driving offense and one disorderly persons offense. \n47. Upon arrival of the Mercer County Correctional Facility Mr.  Boiselle was \nrequired to undress  in the  shower area in the  presence  of an observing Correctional \nOfficer and other inmates.  Mr. Boisselle was required to bend down and cough in a state \nof full undress, in the presence of Correctional Staff and other inmates. \n48. Defendants  strip  searched  him  according  to  policy  without  reasonable \nsuspicion of drug or weapon possession. \n49. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Boisselle \n15 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a6g oef  1262 (cid:10)of 22\nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n--Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law--\n50. Plaintiff incorporates  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs I through 49. \n51. The Fourth Amendment of the United  States  Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable  searches  by  law enforcement  officers,  and  prohibits officers  from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual  in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n52. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs rights under the \nUnited  States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Mercer \nCounty Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiff and Class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the \nPolicy Making Defendants to order/direct Mercer County Corrections Officers to conduct \nsuch searches. \n53. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the County of Mercer, the Mercer County Correctional Facility and the Mercer County \n16 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a7g oef  1272 (cid:10)of 22\nSheriff's Department.  As such, the County of Mercer is directly liable for the damages of \nthe named Plaintiff and members of the Class. \n54. Upon  information  and  belief,  Sheriff Larkin,  Undersheriff Gerasimowicz, \nUndersheriff Tobolski, Undersheriff Gerald, Officer Kemler, Officer McEwan, Warden \nTyler and Deputy Warden Hendrick are  responsible for  establishing the  policies  and \nprocedures to be utilized in the operation of the Mercer County Jail, and are responsible \nfor the implementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, \nLarkin,  Gerasimowicz,  Tobolski,  Gerald,  Tyler  and  Hendrick  are  each  individually \nresponsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the Class. \n55. Sheriff  Larkin,  Undersheriff  Gerasimowicz,  Undersheriff  Tobolski, \nUndersheriff  Gerald,  Officer  Kemler,  Officer  McEwan,  Warden  Tyler  and  Deputy \nWarden  Hendrick  knew  that  the  MCJ's  strip  search  policy  was  illegal,  and  acted \nwillfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n56. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n57. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff has been irreparably injured. \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL \nDEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment--\n58. Plaintiff incorporates by  reference and  realleges  each and  every allegation \nstated in paragraphs I through 57. \n17 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a8g oef  1282 (cid:10)of 22\n59. The policy, custom and practice of the Mercer County Sheriff's Department, \nthe County of Mercer and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in \nthat  these  entities  and  individuals  are  directing/conducting  the  strip  searches  of all \nindividuals placed into the Mercer County Jail without any particularized suspicion that \nthe individuals in question have either contraband or weapons. \n60. Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Mercer and the \nMercer County Sheriffs Department to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n61. Plaintiff incorporates  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 59. \n62. The policy, custom and practice of the Mercer County Sheriff's Department, \nthe County of Mercer and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in \nthat  these  entities  and  individuals  are  directing/conducting  the  strip  searches  of all \nindividuals placed into the Mercer County Jail without any particularized suspicion that \nthe individuals in question have either contraband or weapons. \n63. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Mercer \nCounty Jail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff. \n64. The  continuing  pattern  of strip  searching  individuals  charged  with  mmor \ncrimes (and less) will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of \nthe Class, an adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n18 \n\nCase C3a:0s6e- c3v:3-032-a0v6-50-0G0E0B1-  T  J DB o  c u Dmoecnutm 4e  n  t  F1i l e  d   F0i5le/0d5 0/250/0056/ 2  0  0P6a g  e   P1a9g oef  1292 (cid:10)of 22\n65. Plaintiff demands that the County of Mercer, the Mercer County  Sheriffs \nDepartment, the  Policy  Making Defendants  and  Mercer  County  Corrections  Officers \nimmediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of the Mercer \nCounty Jail  absent any particularized  suspicion that the individuals  in question  have· \neither contraband or weapons, and  seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction \nfrom this Court ordering as much .. \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n66.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n67. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Mercer and the \nMercer County Sheriffs Department have no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary \nto  punish  the  Policy  Making  Defendants,  and  to  send  a  message  to  them  that the \nrequirements of the  United  States  Constitution also  apply  to  government  officials  in \nMercer County. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n68. The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Trafford Boisselle, on behalf of himself and on behalf of \na class of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable  Court grant them the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.
