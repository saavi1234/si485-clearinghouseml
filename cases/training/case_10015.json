Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that jail officials had subjected him to mandatory strip searches, denied him access to legal phone calls and interfered with his mail, and committed sanitary violations relating to footwear and mattresses. </p><p>The plaintiff was a pretrial detainee. He alleged that he was subject to daily, mandatory strip searches from August 30 to September 8th, 2005, from March 14 to March 17, 2006, and from March 20 to March 25, 2006. Plaintiff claimed the sole purpose of these searches was to humiliate him.</p><p>On August 26, 2006, the Court (Judge Dennis Cavanaugh) dismissed several of the claims sua sponte as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). The Court allowed the strip search and interference with legal mail claims to proceed.  </p><p>On June 8, 2007, Judge Cavanaugh, after converting the Defendants' motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, and the case was closed. </p><p></p>",

The statute no longer \nprOVides for waiver of court filing fees for prisoners who are granted leave to proceed in forma \ngaugerls.

This obligation to pay the filing fee \ncontinues even if the prisoner Is transferred to another prison.  Therefore, before submitting \nthis application to the Clerk of the Court, a prisoner should con&ider carefully whether he or \nshe wishes to go forward with the action. \nThe PLRA obligates prisoners who are granted in forma pauperis status to pay the entire filing \nfee in the following manner, regardless of the outcome of the litigation.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1) \nand (2).  The agency having custody over the prisoner shall deduct from the prisoner's \ninstitutional account and forward to the Clerk of the Court (1) an initial partial filing fee equal to \n20% of the greater of the average monthly deposits to the prisoner's account or the average \nmonthly balance in the prisoner's account for the six-month period immediately preceding the \nfiling of the complaint, and (2) payments equal to 20% of the preceding month's income \ncredited to the prisoner's Institutional account each monlh the amount in the account exceeds \n$10.00, until the $150.00 filing fee is paid.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1) and (2).  Howeller, a \nprisoner who has no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee will not \nbe prohibited from bringing a civil action.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(4). \nEach prisoner plaintiff who desires 10 proceed ill fI'l.an.Il ploll.I[;lfirili must submit the following to \nthe Clerk of the Court: \na.  a completed, signed, and daled application to proceed ill fim:rulIlilJJI2~ris \n(attached hereto); and \nb.

If you cannot prepay the $150.00 filing fee, you may request permission to proceed ill ~ \npauperis in accordance with the procedures set forth below.  (If there is more than one \nplaintiff, ru!.Qh plaintiff must separately request permission to proceed in. forma pauperis.) \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (UPLRA\"), effective April 26, 1996, has made \nsignificant changes to the in fonna pauperis statute, 28 U.S.C, § 1915.  The slatute no longer \nprovides for waiver of court filing fees for prisoners who are granted leave to proceed in forma \ngaygeris.  A prisoner who is granted leave to proceed in fQrr:rn! pauperis is not required to pay \nthe filing fees in advance, but the prisoner is obligated to pay the entire filing fee in installment \npayments regardless of the outcome of the proceeding.  This obligation to pay the filing fee \ncontinues even if the prisoner is transferred to another prison.  Therefore, before submitting \nthis application to the Clerk of the Court, a prisoner should consider carefully whether he or \nshe wishes to go forward with the action. \nThe PLRA obligates prisoners who are granted in fil.c!!!.i pauperis status to pay the entire filing \nfee in the following manner, regardless of the outcome oflhe litigation,  28 U.S,C. § 1915(b)(1) \nand (2).  The agency having custody over the prisoner shall deduct from the prisoner's \n,  institutional account and forward to the Clerk of the Court (1) an initial partial filing fee equal to \n20% of the greater of the average monthly deposits to the prisoner's account or the average \nmonthly balance in the prisoner's account for the six-month period immediately preceding the \nfiling of the complaint, and (2) payments equal to 20% of the preceding month's income \ncredited to the prisoner's institutional account each month the amount in the account exceeds \n$10.00, until the $~Q filing fee is paid.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1) and (2).  However, a \nprisoner who has~ass'ets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee will not \nbe prohibited from bringing a civil action.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(4). \nEach prisoner plaintiff who desires to proceed in forma pauperis must submit the following to \nthe Clerk of the Court:  . \na.  a completed, signed, and dated application to proceed in forma pauperis \n(attached hereto); and \nb.  a certified copy of your prison account statement for the 6-month period \nimmediately preceding submission of this application, listing the account \nbalance and all deposits into the account.  A prison account statement must be \nobtained from the appropriate official of each prison at which you are or were \nconfined during the preceding 6 months. \n7.  If your application to proceed in forma pauperis does not conform to these instructions, you \nwill be notified by letter of the nature of the deficiencies.  If these deficiencies are not cured \nwithin 120 days of the date of the letter, the complaint will be deemed withdrawn, the Clerk's \nfile will be closed, and no fees will be assessed against you, \n8.  If you are given permission to proceed in forma Qauperis, the Clerk will prepare and issue a \ncopy of the summons for each defendant.

These  two  district  C011rts  llavc  also  noted  that  jail \npopu.1ations  are  Ilot,ab.Ly  tY'ansitor:y,  mokinq  joint  litiCJatlon \ndifficult.  A  £j.na1  consideration  for  the  District  Court  for  the \nDistrict of  Montana  was  the  possibility  that  ·coercio!.,  subtle  or \nnot,  freqnently  plays  a  roJe  in  relations  between  inmates.\" \nSwenson,  2006  W1  240233,  *1. \nThis  Court  finds  the  reasoning  oi  these  district  courts \np8rsuAsive.  Prisoner's  ClL'C  not.  in  the  some  ::; 'j tuat.ion  as  non \nprisoner  joint plaintiffs;  prisoners'  circumstances  make  joint \nli.tigation exceptional.lY  difficult. \nIn  addi.tion.  Plaintiffs  here  have  as~crLcd claims  that \nrequire  individualized  scn)cni.ng  pursuant  lo  78  U.S.C. \n2  1915(e) (2).  For  eXcullpJe,  Plaintiffs  chalJenge  the  failure  to \npost  a  law  library sclledule  and  to  provide  adequate  access  to \nfederal  case  law.  The  Court  construes  this  as  an  attempt  to \nstate  a  claim  for  violatioll  of  the  right  of  acccss  to  the  courts. \nTo  ~\"'Late  such  a  claim,  however,  a  prisoner  must.  show  that  prison \noff icials  caused  him  past  or'  imminent  \"ac Lua.L  :i nj ury.\"  See  Lewis \n518  U.S.  343,  348-~~ and  n.3  (1996);  Olivcr  v.  Fauver, \n118  F. 3d  17~,  J77-78  (3d  Cir.  1991).  Thus,  each  prisoner  must. \n1  injury  to  him  in  order  t.o  state  a  claim.  Joinder  of  their \nclaims,  howcver,  would  permit  all  Plalntiffs  to  avoid  the  risk of \na  ·strike\"  undcr  §  1915(g)  if even  one  Plaintiff  states  a  claim, \nbecause  §  1915(g)  13  a  stxike  only  if tll8  cnLl.re  action  is \n4 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-02461-DMC-MF     Document 2      Filed 06/05/2006     Page 5 of 5\ndismissed.  For  all  of  the  foregoing  reasons,  joi.nder  is  not \nappropriate. \nRule  21  provides  Lhat  -[plerties  mny  bc  dropped  [from  n \ncasel  on  such  terms  as  are  just.\"  It would  not  bc  just \nmerely  to  dismiss  all  but  the  lead  Plaintiff  from  this  casco \nInstead,  this  Court  will  direct  the  Clerk  to  open  a  separate  case \nfor  each  of  the  other  Plaintiffs  in  this  action.  Each  of  the \nP.laintiffs  will be  grented  leave  to  fi.l.e  an  amended  complaillL \nasserting  his  individual  ~leims. \nNothing  in  Lh.i 6  Opinion  should be  construed  as  precluding \nany  or  all  of  the  Plaintiffs  from  cooperating  to  the  extent  thaL \nthey  ere  able  or  16  preventing  consolidation  of  these  cases  for \ntrial  if th~t becomes  appropriate  at  a  laLe(  da~e. \nIII.
