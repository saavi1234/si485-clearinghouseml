Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, alleged that the policy was unconstitutional in that it violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  Plaintiff sought monetary and injunctive relief, as well as certification of a plaintiff class consisting of all individuals who were strip searched upon their entry into the Correctional Facility after being arrested on misdemeanor, traffic, or other minor charges.  </p><p>Defendants answered Plaintiff's complaint by generally denying the charges.</p><p>The PACER docket reflects that, during 2006 and 2007, the parties engaged in discovery and attended numerous status conferences before Magistrate Judge Joel Schneider.  At the time of this summary, the case was still active, and no substantive motions were pending before the court.</p>",

Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for himself and each member of the \nproposed class who have suffered from the wrongful actions ofthe Defendants described \nherein; a declaration that the Defendants' policies are unconstitutional; and, an injunction \nprecluding the Defendants from continuing to violate the rights of those placed in their \ncustody or detention. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff, William Suggs (\"Suggs\") is, and at all times relevant hereto has \nbeen, a resident of the State of New Jersey.

Defendant Cumberland County Correctional Facility (the \"Correctional \nFacility\") is a political subdivision created through the County of Cumberland, State of \nNew Jersey. At all times relevant hereto, the Correctional Facility, together with the \nCounty, was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all \nCorrectional Facility personnel working in the Correctional Facility. In addition, at all \ntimes relevant hereto, Defendant Correctional Facility, together with the County of \nCumberland, was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Correctional Facility and for \nensuring that Correctional Facility personnel employed in the Correctional Facility \nobeyed the Constitution and the laws of the United States and of the State of New Jersey. \n6.  The Cumberland County Sheriff's Department (the \"Sheriff's Department\") is \n. a County of Cumberland political subdivision, organized and existing under the laws of \nNew Jersey. At all times relevant hereto, the Sheriff's Department, together with the \nCounty of Cumberland, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, \nimplementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Sheriff's Department, and \nwas responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriff's \nDepartment personnel and that they obey the Constitution and the laws of the United \nStates and of the State of New Jersey. \n7.  Defendant Glenn Saunders (\"Warden Saunders\") is the Warden of the \nCorrectional Facility and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 4 of 18\npretrial and other detainees over which the Correctional Facility exercises custodial or \nother control. Warden Saunders is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual \nand official capacities. \n8.

Collectively, Warden Saunders, Assistant Warden Walker, Captain Lamcken, \nSheriff Barruzza, and Undersheriff Elliott, will be referred to as the \"Policy Making \nDefendants\". \nJURISDICTION \na.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.c. §§1331, 1341 and 1343 because it was filed to obtained compensatory damages, \npunitive damages and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the \nrights of citizens of the United States secured by the United States Constitution and by \nfederal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§1981 and 1983. This Court also has jurisdiction over \nthis action under the provisions of28 U.S.C. §2201, as it was filed to obtain declaratory \nrelief relative to the Constitutionality of the policies of a local government. \nb.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 139 I (e)(2) because the events \ngiving rise to the Plaintiff s claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this \njudicial district. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n14.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(I), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of himself and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who were arrested for misdemeanors or other petty crimes or minor \nviolations and who were unlawfully detained and strip-searched upon their entry into the \nCorrectional Facility. \n5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 6 of 18\n15.  The Class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined of: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into custody of the Cumberland \nCounty Correctional Facility after being charged and arrested within the County \nof Cumberland for misdemeanors, violations, traffic infractions, failing to make \npayment on outstanding traffic violations, failing to make payment on outstanding \nfines or other minor crimes or violations and were or will be strip-searched upon \ntheir transfer and entry into the Cumberland County Correctional Facility. \nThe Class period commences on or about January 9, 2004 and extends to the date on \nwhich the Municipal Defendants are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their \nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip-searches absent \nreasonable suspicion. Specifically excluded from the Class are Defendants and any and \nall of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or \nassignees. \n16.  This action may be brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n17.  The members of the Class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nThere are and have been hundreds of people who have been arrested for misdemeanors, \nviolations, traffic infractions, failing to make payment on outstanding traffic violations, \nfailing to make payment on outstanding fines or other minor crimes who were strip-\nsearched under the circumstances described herein. \n18.  Joinder of all these individuals is impracticable because of the large number \nof Class members and the fact that Class members are likely dispersed over a large \ngeographical area, with some members, residing outside of Cumberland County and this \nJudicial District. Furthermore, many members of the Class are low-income persons, may \n6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 7 of 18\nnot speak English, may not know of their rights and likely would have great difficulty in \npursuing their rights individually. \n19.  Common questions oflaw and fact exist as to all members of the Class that \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  The \npredominant common questions oflaw and fact include, without limitation, the common \nand predominate question of whether the Defendants' written and/or de facto policies of \nstrip-searching individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or violations when \ntransferred to and placed into the custody of the Correctional Facility violate the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a \nwritten and/or de facto policy existed during the Class period. \n20.  PlaintiffSugg's claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class. \nPlaintiff and all members of the Cjass  have sustained damages arising out of Defendants' \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered \nby the Class. \n21.  The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nofthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff \nhas no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members oftheClass. \n22.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nClass is impracticable given the large number of Class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed over a large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nClass to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \n7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 8 of 18\nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnifY the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n23. The named Plaintiff has retained counsel with substantial experience and \nsuccess in the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  Plaintiff Suggs is \nbeing represented by William Riback; Jonathan W. Cuneo and Charles J. LaDuca of \nCuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP; Elmer Robert Keach, III; and Seth Lesser and Fran \nRudich ofthe Locks Law Firm, PLLC. \n24. William Riback is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who \nhas successfully litigated class actions in both state and federal courts in a number of \njurisdictions across the country. \n25. Jonathan W. Cuneo and Charles J. LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, \nhave extensive experience in state and federal trial and appellate courts, before law \nenforcement authorities and in proceedings before the United States Congress.  Cuneo \nand LaDuca have successfully prosecuted complex class actions, including cases \ninvolving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer protection and products liability \nin state and federal courts throughout the United States. In addition to this experience, \nCuneo and LaDuca are co-counsel in several strip-search class actions, with Mr. Keach, \none of which was recently certified in the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of New York against the County of Schenectady and other related Defendants. \n8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 9 of 18\n26. Mr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who has \nlitigated a wide variety of civil rights actions and has litigated class action lawsuits in \nstate and federal courts in five states.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated strip search \ncases against the Troy City Police Department and the Schenectady City School District, \nand was lead counsel in the Rensselaer County Jail strip search class action that recently \nsettled in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. \n27. Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Locks Law Firm with offices in Cherry \nHill and New York City, are both experienced civil rights and class action attorneys,. \nMr. Lesser is one of this country's premier class action attorneys having successfully \nlitigated civil rights, consumer protection and products liability class actions against \nFortune 500 companies in courts across the country, including both New Jersey state and \nfederal courts. Ms. Rudich has litigated scores of individual and class action civil rights \ncases against a number of Defendants in over ten jurisdictions throughout the United \nStates. \n28. In short, Plaintiffs counsel have the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against the Defendants.  Counsel for the Plaintiff is not \naware of any conflicts among members of the Class, or between counsel and members of \nthe Class. \n29. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip-search regimen for at least the past \nseveral years. \n9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 10 of 18\n30. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, Plaintiff \nseeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip-searches of individuals \ncharged with misdemeanor or minor crimes that were transported to and placed \ninto the custody of the Correctional Facility.  In short, the Municipal Defendants \nand the Policy Making Defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to all \nClass members. \n31.  In addition to, and in the alternative, Plaintiff seeks certification under Rule \n23(b)(3) or seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n32.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials, such as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the employees they \nsupervise, from performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with \nmisdemeanors or other minor crimes or violations unless there is reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n33.  Cumberland County, the Sheriff's Department, the Correctional Facility, and \nthe Policy Making Defendants have, nonetheless, instituted a written and/or de facto \npolicy, custom or practice of strip-searching all individuals who enter the custody of the \nCorrectional Facility regardless of the nature oftheir charged crime and without the \npresence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon \nor contraband. \n34.  Further, Cumberland County, the Sheriff's Department, the Correctional \n10 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 11 of 18\nFacility, and the Policy Making Defendants have also instituted a written and/or de facto \npolicy, custom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of \nthe vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the \nCorrectional Facility, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their \ncharged crime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are \ncollectively referred to as \"strip-searches.\" \n35.  Cumberland County, the Sheriffs Department, the Correctional Facility, and \nthe Policy Making Defendants know or should know,that they may not institute, enforce \nor permit enforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip-searches without \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion \n36.  The Defendants' written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom \nmandating wholesale strip-searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n37.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip-search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n38.  Cumberland County, the Sheriff's Department, the Correctional Facility, and \nPolicy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to \nrectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip-searching all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Cumberland County Correction Facility \nwithout any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This \nwritten and/or de facto policy made the strip-searching of pre-trial detainees routine; \n11 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 12 of 18\nneither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the \ncircumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, \npractice and custom of routine strip-searches. \n39.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facIo policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff was the victim of a routine strip-search upon their entry into \nthe Correction Facility.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable \nsuspicion. Strip-searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among other \ninnocuous offenses such as, traffic violations, outstanding traffic fines and other minor \nfines. \n40.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip-searches \n- each member of the Class, including the named Plaintiff - has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n41. Mr. Suggs' experience is representative of the Class. \n42.  On or about July 9, 2005 at approximately 6:00 p.m. Plaintiff was \ntransported to the Cumberland County Correctional Facility and detained on a \nchild support warrant. \n43.  Plaintiff was immediately brought to a holding cell with other detainees. \nPlaintiff was called out of said cell at approximately 6:30 p.m.  by a male \nCorrectional Officer.  Plaintiff was brought to private room in direct vicinity \nof the holding cell.  Plaintiff was directed to pull his pants down, and at that \n12 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 13 of 18\ntime a visual cavity search was conducted.  Plaintiff was then visually \ninspected from the front by said Correctional Officer. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n(Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies \nTo Avoid Constitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law) \n44.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 42. \n45. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip-searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations abscnt \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n46. The actions of all Defendants as detailed above, violated Plaintiffs and the \nClass' rights under the United States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively \nreasonable for Correctional Facility personnel to strip-search Plaintiff and the members \nof the Class based on their arrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not \nobjectively reasonable for the Policy Making Defendants to order/direct Correctional \nFacility personnel to conduct such searches or to have a police or practice permitting such \nsearches. \n13 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 14 of 18\n47. These strip-searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of Cumberland County, the Sheriff's Department, and the Correctional Facility. \nAs such, these Defendants are directly liable for the damages of the Class. \n48. Upon information and belief, Cumberland County, the Sheriff's Department, \nand the Correctional Facility are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures \nto be utilized in the operation of the Correctional Facility and are responsible for the \nimplementation of the strip-search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, \nCumberland County, the Sheriff's Department, and the Correctional Facility are each \nindividually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the \nClass. \n49.  Cumberland County, the Sheriff's Department, and the Correctional Facility \nkllew that the above-described strip-search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, \nknowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff and members of the Class of their \nConstitutional rights. \n50. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n51.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and the Class have been irreparably injured. \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOR PLAINTIFF AND THE CLASS AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nDemand for Declaratory Judgment \n52.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 50. \n14 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 15 of 18\n53. The policy, custom and practice of the Defendants is unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip-searches of all individuals \nplaced into the Correctional Facility without particularized suspicion that the individuals \nin question have either contraband or weapons. \n54.  Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip-search policies of the Defendants to be \nunconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOR PLAINTIFF AND THE CLASS AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nDemand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction \n55.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 53. \n56. The policy, custom and practice ofthe Defendants are unconstitutional, in \nthat these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip-searches of all \nindividuals placed into the Correctional Facility without particularized suspicion that the \nindividuals in question have either contraband or weapons. \n57. This policy is currently in place at the Correctional Facility, with new and/or \nprospective members of the Class subjected to the harms that have already been inflicted \nupon the named Plaintiff. \n58. The continuing pattern of strip-searching individuals charged with minor \ncrimes or violations will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members \nof the Class and an adequate remedy does not exist at law. \n59. Plaintiff demands that the Defendants immediately desist from strip searching \n15 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 16 of 18\nindividuals placed into the custody of the Correctional Facility absent any particularized \nsuspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and seek \nboth a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n60. The actions of the Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that they \ncontinue to propagate an illegal strip-search policy even though they know for a fact that \ntheir actions are unconstitutional. \n61. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants have no respect for the civil \nrights of individual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive \ndamages is necessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to \nthem that the requirements ofthe United States Constitution also apply to government \nofficials in Cumberland County. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n62.  The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff William Suggs, on behalf of himself and on behalf of a \nClass of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23 with Mr. Suggs as Class representative. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs \nFirst Cause of Action detailed herein, awarding Compensatory Damages to \n16 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 01/09/2006     Page 17 of 18\nnamed Plaintiff Suggs and each member of the proposed Class in an amount \nto be determined by a Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class \nwide basis. \nC.  A judgment against Policy Making Defendants on Plaintiffs First Cause \nof Action for punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial. \nD.  A declaratory judgment against Cumberland County, the Sheriffs \nDepartment, and the Correctional Facility declaring their policy, practice and \ncustom of strip and visual cavity searching all detainees entering the \nCorrectional Facility, regardless of the crime charged or suspicion of \ncontraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nE.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants \nCumberland County, the Sheriffs Department, and the Correctional Facility \nfrom continuing to strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with \nmisdemeanors or minor crimes and violations absent particularized, \nreasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the search is concealing \nweapons or other contraband. \nF.  A monetary award for attorney's fees and the costs of this action, pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ.

This action was commenced on January 9, 2006, as a class action. \n2.  After two years of intensive litigation, including extensive discovery and motion \npractice, and as a result of intensive, arm's length negotiations between Class Counsel \nand Defi:ndants, including settlement conferences betbre fom1ef Magistrate Judge Joel \nRosen,  the  parties  have  reached  accord  with  respect  to  a  Settlement  that  provides \nsubstantial benefits to Settlement Class Members, in return for a release and dismissal of \nthe claims at issue in this case against the Defendants (\"Settlement Agreement\").  TIle \nresulting Settlement Agreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on August 19, \n20011. \n3.  As  part  of the  Order  Granting  Preliminary  Approval,  this  Court  approved  a \nproposed Notice  Plan and  Class  Notice,  which  provided  Settlement Class  Members \nnotice of the proposed settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an opportunity for Class \nMembers  10  file  objections  to  the  Settlement,  and  an  oppOliunity  to  opt-out  of Ihe \nSettlement. \n4.  As of the deadline for  the filing of objections, no  objcction~ or opt-outs were \nJiled.  Given the size of this Settlement, and the Notice Plan described above, thi~ Court \nfinds that the lack of objections and opt-outs is indicative of Ihe faimess, rea~on..'tblencss \nand adequacy of (he Settlement with the Defendants. \n5.  The settling parties have filed with the Court an affidavit iTom The Garden City \nGroup declaring that the mailing of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice \nPlan, has been completed. \n6.  The COllrt  finds  that  the  published  notice,  nlailed  notice  and  [ntemel posting \n2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS   Document 48   Filed 11/25/08   Page 3 of 7 PageID: 548\nconstitute the best practicable notice of the fairness Hearing, proposed Settlement, Class \nCounsel's application for  fees  and  expenses,  and  other matters set forth  in the  Class \nNotice and Short Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient \nnotice to all members of the Settlement Cla~s, and complied fully with (he reqllirements \nof Rule 23 ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, \nthe laws of New Jersey and any other applicable law. \n7.  Any  persons  who  wished  he  e:».cluded  .trom  this  action were  provided  an \n\\(1 \nopportunity  to  \"opt-out\"  pursuant to  the  Notice.  However,  no  individuals  opted  to \nexclude themselves from this action. \nS.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the:  Settlement, Settlement Agreement, \nthe tenng llf th\", releases contained within the Settlement Agreement, and the Final Order \nand Judgment.  Settlement Class Memoors do not have a rurther opportunity to opt-out or \nthis Action. \n9.  Any Class Member who did not timely  file and serve an objection in writing to \nthe Settlement Agreement, to  the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiff's \nClass  Counsel' $  application  for  fees,  costs,  and  expenses,  in  accordance  with  the \nprocedure set forth in the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary \nApproval  01'  SeUJement,  is  deemed  to  have  waived  any  such  o~jection hy  appeal, \ncollateral attack, or othen'Vise. \n10.  On  the  basis or all  of the  issues in this  litigation,  and  the  provisions  of the \nSettlen1ent Agreement, the Court is of' the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable \nand adequate compromise of the claims agaillBt the Defendants in this case, pursuant to \nRule 23 of'the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS   Document 48   Filed 11/25/08   Page 4 of 7 PageID: 549\nCourt has considered in aflirming this Settlement, including: \na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nb.  TIlis Settlement has the benefit of providing reJiei'to Class Members now, \nwithout  further  litigation,  under  circumstances  where  the  liability  issues  are  still \nvigorously eontc$ted among the patties to  this litigation and among the parties to the \nindividual  litigation.  This  Settlement  provides  Class  Members  with  a  substantial \nmonetary bene!l!. \nc.  This Settlement is clearly a byproduct of hard-fought litigation between \nthe parties, and not a result or any collusion on the part of Class Counselor Counsel for \nthe Defendants. \n11.  Class  Counsel  submitted  to  the  Court  and  served  on  the  Defendants  their \napplication I(lt reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses consistent with (he krms \nof the Settlement Agreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request and \nhereby grants the request. \n12.  The  claims  procedure  established  under  the  Settlement  Agreement  is  fair,  a \nsimplified process, and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work \nout any unanlicipallold probllolms. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OJ!' THE .FOREGOING FINDINGS \nOF  FACT  AND  THE  COURT  HEREBY  MAKES  THE  FOLLOWIN(i \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW: \n13.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  and  the  subject  matter  of this \nproceeding. \n14.  Pursuant  to  Rule  23  of (he  Federal  Rules  or Civil  Procedure,  the  fI:JlIowing \n4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00087-RMB-JS   Document 48   Filed 11/25/08   Page 5 of 7 PageID: 550\nSettlement Class is certitied lor Plll'POSCS of finlll settlement: \nAll  persons who have been or will be  placed  into the custody of the Cumberland \nCounty Corr~ctional Facility after being charged and arrested witbin th~ County of \nCumberland  for  misdemeanors,  violations,  tramc  infractions,  tailing  to  make \npayment on  outstllnding lrallie violations, failing to make payment on outstanding \nfines or other minor crimes or violations and Were or will be strip s~archcd upon their \ntransfer and entry  into Cumberland COllnty Correctional Facility.

Specifically \nexcluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their respective atlliiatcs, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employe~s or assignees. \n15.  The Court finds that, for the purpOStl of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule \n23  of the  Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure IIrt: satisfied, and that a class action is an \nappropriate method for resolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for \nclass eertitication under Rule 23 are present.  The Class Membtlr8 are asecrlainabltl and \ntoo numerous to be .j oined.  Questions of law and fact common to all Class members \n. \npredominate over individual issues and should be determined in one proceeding with \nrespect to all Class member:;,  The Class Represtlntative's claims are lypical of those or \nthc Class.  The Class action mechanism is superior to altenlative means for udj udicating \nand resolving this action. \n16.
