    "summary": "<p>On August 22, 2005, a female plaintiff represented by attorneys Mark E. Merin of Sacramento, California, Andrew C. Schwartz of Walnut Creek, California, and Robert R. Rothstein of Santa Fe, New Mexico, filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the United States District Court for New Mexico, challenging the strip search and visual body cavity search policy in effect at the Lincoln County Detention Center.  The policy at issue required that all persons housed in the Detention Center undergo strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned and without reasonable suspicion that the searches would produce contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff maintained that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as state constitutional provisions and tort law, and sought monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and class certification.  Named as defendants were Cornell Companies, Inc. and/or Correctional Systems, Inc. (\"CSI\") (the company that had contracted to operate the Detention Center), the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners, and past and present Lincoln County Sheriffs.  A First Amended Complaint, filed on June 28, 2006, added individuals defendants associated with Cornell/CSI and deleted the county sheriffs as defendants.</p><p>Almost immediately after the suit was filed, Cornell issued revised strip search policies for the Lincoln County Detention Center. </p><p>The parties engaged in extensive discovery, which included exchange of documents, interrogatories, and depositions.  The parties took a statistical sampling of the files of approximately 3,000 persons booked at Lincoln County Detention Center during the period from August 22, 2002, until August 31, 2005 and estimated that  approximately 1,200 persons who were arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, were strip searched.</p><p>On July 12 and 13, 2006, the parties participated in mediation and arrived at an agreed Stipulation of Settlement.  Under the Stipulation, the settlement class was defined as: \"all persons arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, on or between August 22, 2002, and August 31, 2005, who were strip searched at the Lincoln County Detention Center prior to arraignment.\"  Defendants agreed to pay $1.6 million for settlement of the class claims.  Of that fund, $750,000 was earmarked for distribution to qualified claimants that submitted a claim form.  The named plaintiff was to receive $100,000.  $600,000 was allocated for attorneys' fees and $150,000.00 to cover the costs of claims administration. </p><p> </p><p>The District Court (District Judge William P. Johnson) granted preliminary approval of the class action settlement and conditionally certified the settlement class.  Following a fairness hearing on November 29, 2007, the settlement was approved.</p><p></p>",

On or ahout May 26, 2005, plaintiff SHAROJ\\ A LLlSOl\\ (hereinaftcr referred to \nas \"plaintiff') was arrested allegedly on an outstanding wammt for issuing a worthless S 16.36 \ncheck in Alamogordo, New Mexico.

Plaintiffwas coerced, forced, and \ncompelled to disrobe for the strip search in an area that could be ohserved by persons who were \nnot participating in the search and who wcre of the opposite sex. \n17.  Within ninety (90) days of the aforesaid strip search, plaintifffi1cd a group \nGm'ernmcnt Tort Claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of said claim is \nattached hereto as Exhibit ;'A\", and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by this reference). \nPlaintiJls group claim \"as denied on or about July 8, 2005, allowing the filing of this class \naction complaint to include claims for state constitutional violatiolls. \n18.  Plaintiffis infornlcd and believes, and therefore alleges, that defendants routinely \nfollow their policy, practice, and custOlll of subjecting pre-arraignmcnt detainees, including \nplaintiff, and all those she represents, to strip and visual body cavity searches without tirst \nhaving, and recording in writing, a reasonahle suspicion that the search will be productive of \ncontraband or weapons. \n7 \n\n19.  Plaintiff is infonned and believes. and thereon alleges. that defendants have the \nahility to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, speciticallythose who, while in \ndefendants' custody, at the LINCOLN County Jail within threc (3) years prior to the filing of this \nComplaint, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to \narraignmcnt without defendants first having. and recording. a reasonable suspicion that the \nsearches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n20.  Defendants LIKCOLN COUNTY, COR'-'ELL, CSI. and VIRDE)l are personally \nresponsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy. practice, and custom \npursuant to which plaintift~ and those she represents. were subjected to strip searches. \n21.  As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, plainti ff. \nand each orthe persons similarly situated. suffered physical. mental, and emotional distress. \ninvasion of privacy. and violation of due process of law and state and federal statutory and \nconstitutional rights, and are entitled to recover damages according to proof. \nIV. \nCLASS CLAIMS \n22.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintift~ and all those similarly \nsituated. were subjected were perfollned pursuant to policies. practices, and customs of \ndefendants LINCOLN COUNTY, CORNELL, CSI. and VIRDEN. the individual SHERIFF'S \nDEPUTIES sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 50. and the individuals whose !lanleS \narc not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES I through 20.  The \nsearches complained of herein were perfonncd without regard to the nature of the alleged \nofrens~s for which plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, had been arrested. without regard to \nwhether or not plaintiff. and those she represents. were eligible for being cited and released. \n8 \n\nwithout regard to whether or not plaintiff, and those similarly situat~d, were eligible for andior \nwere released on his or her own recognizance, or on bail.  FurthemlOre. the searches complained \nof herein were perfonned without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintitl or any \nof those similarly situated, so searched possessed wcapons or ('ontraband, and those facts being \narticulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.  And the searches complained of \nherein were perfomled without defendants taking reasonable precautions to make certain that \nplaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, were not observed by others not involved in the \nsearch. \nPlainti ff brings this action on her own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly \nsituated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n24.  The class of plaintiffs is defined to include all persons arrested on charges not \ninvolving violence. drugs or weapons who, in thc period from and including three (3) years for \nFederal Claims and two (2) years for State Claims prior to the filing of this Complaint. and \ncontinuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices complained of herein cease, were \narrested and subjected to a pre-arrai!;'lU11ent strip and/or visual body cavity searches at the \nLl~COL,\\ County Jail without defendants first having. and recording in writing, a reasonable \nsuspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or \",'capons. \n25.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 23(a). the members of \nthe class are so numcrous that joinder of all members is impracti('al.  Plainti ff docs not kno\\\\' tbe \nexact number of dass membcrs.  Plaintiff is informed and be.lie\\'es. and thereupon alleges, that \nthere are more than 10 pcrsons per day who are arrested by defendants andior are in the custody \n9 \n\nof de fendants who are and have been subjected to thc searches complained of hcrein as a result of \ndefendants' policy, practice. and custom relating to said searches. \n26.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is \ninfonned and believes. and thereupon alleges, that therc are many questions of fact common to \nthe class including. but not limited to: (I) whether defendants routinely subject all persons \narrested to visual body cavity searches prior to arrai!,'Il1l1ent if they intend such persons to be \nhoused in the LIKCOLN County lail; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual \nbody cavity searches prior to arraignment without there bcing any reasonable suspicion, based on \nspecific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrcstee has concealed drugs, weapons, \nand/or contraband in hodi Iy cavities which could be detected by means of a strip and'or visual \nbody cavity search; (3) whether the strip andlor visual hody cavity searches are conducted in an \narea of privacy so that thc searches calIDot be observed by persons not participating in the \nsearches; and, (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches arc reasonably related to \ndefendants' penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and whether or not there arc \nless intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n27.  In accordance with Federal Rules ofCivill'rocedure, Rule 23(a). plaintiffis \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that therc are many questions of law cOlllmon to \nthe class including. but not limited to: (I) whether defendants may pcr[onn strip and/or visual \nbody cavity searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion. based \non specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular prearraignment detainee has conc.ealed \ndrugs. weapons and/or contraband which would likely be disco\\\"CTed by a strip and/or visual body \ncavity search: (2) whether defendants may perfoml strip and/or visual body cavity searches on \n10 \n\npersons without first reasonably relating the strip search of the subject to defendants' penological \ninterest to maintain the security of the jail and detemlining if there is a less intrusive method to \nprotect that interest; (3) whether strip and/or visual body cavity searches may be conducted in \nareas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating \nplaintiffs' State and Federal constitutional rights and plaintiffs State statutory rights; (4) whether \nor not defendants' strip search policy and procedure is in accordance w'ith the State and/or \nFederal Constitution; (5) whether or not plaintiffs state claims are barred by the provisions of \n~ew Mexico Tort Claims Act; and, (6) whether or not defendants have an immunity defense to \nplaintiffs claims under Section 41-4-12 of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act. \n28.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the \nrepresentative plaintiffis typical of the class.  Plaintiffw<\\s arrested on a minor olTense not \ninvolving violence, drugs or wcapons and was searched, prior to arraignment, without defendants \nhaving a reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, \nweapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in \na supcrvisor-approved writing).  Representative plainti rfhas the same interests and suffered the \nsame type of injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiirs claims arose because of defendants' \npolicy, practice, and custom of suhjecting arrestees to strip aI1lUor visual body cavity searches \nbefore arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the \nsearch would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Each class member suffered actual \ndamages as a result of being SUbjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search.  The actual \ndamages suffered hy the representative plaintiff is similar in t~ve and amount to the actual \ndamages suffered by each class member. \n11 \n\n29.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 23(a). the \nreprescntative plail1liffwill fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs interests \nare consistent with and not al1lagonistic to the interests of the class. \n30.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Ciyi I Procedure. Rule 23(b)( I )(A). \nprosecution of separate actions by individuall1lembers of the class would create a risk that \ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to indi,idualmcmbers of the class would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the panies opposing the complaint. \nJ 1.  In accordance with Federal Rules or Civil Procedure. Rule 23(b)( 1 )(B), \nprosecution of separate actions by indiyidualmembcrs of the class \\\\'ould create a risk of \ninconsistent adjudications with respect to individual mcmbers orthe class which would. as a \npractical matter. suhstantial1y impair or impede the interests of the other mcmbers orthe class to \nprotect their interests. \n32.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffis \ninformed and believes, and thereupon al1cges, that defendants have acted on grounds general1y \napplicable to the class. therehy making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with \nrespect to the class as a whole. \n33.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3). this class \naction is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the \ncontra,usy between the parties.  Plaintiff is infonned and believes, and thereupon alleges. that \nthe interests ofmemhers of the class in individually controlling the proscclition of a separate \naction is low, in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at \nall.  Plaintiff also is infol111ed and believes. and thereupon alleges. that the amounts at stake for \n12 \n\nindividuals are so small that separate suits would be impracticahle.  Plaintiff is infol111cd and \nbelie\\'es. and thereupon alleges, that most members of the class will not he ahle to find counsel to \nreprcsent them.  Plainti ff is in[ol111ed and believes. and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to \nconcentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the c1ainls arise in the same location; i.e., \nthe LI:-.ICOLN County Jail.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions \nof law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts. \n34.  PlaintilT does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff is \ninformed and belie\\cs. and thereupon alleges. that the identities of the class members may be \nascertained from records maintaincd by defendants L1NCOI.N COUI\\TY. COR'i'ELL CSI. \nVIRDE:-.I and the LINCOLl'\\ COUJ\\TY SHERIFF'S DEPARTME:-.IT.  PlaintilTis infoI111ed and \nbclie\\es, and thereupon alleges, that defendants' records reflect the identities, including \naddresses and telephonc numhers. of the persons who have heen held in custody in the \nLINCOL~ County .Tails.  I'laintiffis informed and nelieves. and thereupon alleges. Ihat records \nof, and maintained by defcndants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity \nsearch. when the search occurred, where the search occurred. \\\\'hether any reasonable sllspicion \nfor the search existed and was recorded in a supervisor-appro\\'<!d writing. whether the search \\\\'as \n\\'ideotaped, when persons search cd were arraigned. and the charges on which such persons were \narrested.  Plaintiff is informed and believes. and thereupon alleges, that all orthe foregoing \ninfonnation is contained in defendants' computer system and that the information necessary to \nidentify the class members, by last known addresses. and the dates and reasons for their arrests \nandior release from custody. is readily available from said computer systcm. \n13 \n\n35.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Proccdure, Rule 23(c)(2)(b), class \nmembers must bc furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including \nindividual notice to all members who can bc identified through r~asonable effort.  Plaintiffis \ninformed ami helieves, and thereupon alleges, that defendants' computer records contain a last \nknown address for class memhers.  Plaintiff contemplates that individual notice will be given to \nclass memhers at such last known address by first class mail.  Plaintiff contemplates that the \nnotice will infonTI class memhers of the following: \nJ.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class: \n11.  The nature of the action: \nIII.  Their right to \"opt ouC of the action within a givcn time, in which event \nthey will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \nTheir right. if they do not \"opt out,\" to be represented by their own counsel \n1\\'. \nand to enter an appearance in the case: otherwise they wi II be represented \nby the named class plaintiff and the named class plaintiffs counsel; and \nv.  Their right, ifihcy do not \"opt out,\" to share in any rccovery in favor of \nthe class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common \nissues ad\\'erse to the class. \nV. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTIO:'ti \n(Civil Rights Violations Under 42 USC ยง 1983) \n36.

Plaintiff, for herself and all those in the\nclass of similarly situated persons, seeks an order declaring illegal Defendantsโ policy of\nsubjecting detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they are\narraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of\ncontraband. \nDefendantsโ strip search and visual body cavity search policies, practices, and customs\nviolate those rights of Plaintiff, and all those she represents, which are secured by the Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and which entitle Plaintiff, and\nall those similarly situated, to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.\nยง 1983.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiff includes, on behalf of herself and on behalf of all those she\nrepresents, supplemental claims under New Mexico state law against Defendants for\nviolation of the State constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures\nas defined in the New Mexico Constitution, Art.

During his tenure as\nWarden, Holm was the immediate supervisor of Defendants Peter Morales, Lucy Vega and\nDoes 1 - 50.  In addition, at all times material hereto, Holm was a law enforcement officer\n-5-\n\nand public employee as those terms are defined in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, ยงยง41-4-\n3 (D) and (F) NMSA 1978, as amended, and was acting within the course and scope of his\nduties as well as under color of law.  In regard to Plaintiffโs ยง1983 claims, Holm is sued in\nboth his individual and official capacities.   \n8. Defendant Roger Jeffers (โhereinafter referred to as โJeffersโ), upon\ninformation and belief, is now and at all times material hereto was a resident of Lincoln\nCounty.  Commencing on or about April 1, 2005, Jeffers was employed by CSI and/or\nCornell as the Warden of LCDC.  In that capacity, he was responsible for assuring that\nLCDCโs policies and procedures complied with constitutional standards and correctional\npractices.  In particular, he was responsible for the preparation, promulgation and\nimplementation of LCDC policies and procedures regarding searches of detainees and\ninmates, including those policies and procedures regarding searches which had been\nformulated by Holm which Jeffers continued to enforce and implement and which remained\nin force and effect at the time of the detention of Plaintiff and others similarly situated. \nDuring his tenure as Warden, Jeffers was the immediate supervisor of Defendants Peter\nMorales, Lucy Vega and Does 1through 50.

Defendant Peter Morales (hereinafter referred to as โMoralesโ), upon\ninformation and belief, is now and at all times material hereto was a resident of Lincoln\nCounty.  At all times material hereto, Morales was an employee of CSI and/or Cornell who,\nas part of his duties at LCDC, subjected Plaintiff, and others whom she represents, to pre-\narraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in\nwriting, a reasonable suspicion that such searches would be productive of contraband or\nweapons.  In addition, at all times material hereto, Morales was a law enforcement officer\nand public employee as those terms are defined in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, ยงยง 41-\n4-3 (D) and (F) NMSA 1978, as amended, and was acting within the course and scope of his\nduties as well as under color of law.  \n10. Defendant Lucy Vega (hereinafter referred to as โVegaโ), upon information\nand belief, is now and at all times material hereto has been a resident of Lincoln County.  At\nall times material hereto, Vegas was an employee of CSI and/or Cornell who, as part of her\nduties at LCDC, subjected Plaintiff, and others whom she represents, to pre-arraignment strip\nand/or visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable\nsuspicion that such searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.  In addition, at\nall times material hereto, Vega was a law enforcement officer and public employee as those\nterms are defined in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, ยงยง 41-4-3 (D) and (F) NMSA 1978,\nas amended, and was acting within the course and scope of her duties as well as under color\nof law.  \n-7-\n\n11. Defendants LCDC Corrections Officers Does 1 - 50 are, or were, natural\npersons whose identities are not known who were employed as corrections officers by CSI\nand/or Cornell at LCDC during the relevant time period.  As part of their duties, Does 1 - 50\nsubjected Plaintiff, and/or those she represents, to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body\ncavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the\nsearches would be productive of contraband or weapons.  All such persons were law\nenforcement officers and public employees as those terms are defined in the New Mexico\nTort Claims Act ยงยง 41-4-3 (D) and (F) NMSA 1978, as amended, and were acting within the\ncourse and scope of their duties as well as under color of law.  \n12. Defendant Roes 1 - 20 are natural persons whose identities are not known and\nwho are sued by the fictitious names of Roes 1 - 20.  Such persons were agents and/or\nemployees of Lincoln County, CSI and/or Cornell who participated in formulating,\npromulgating, implementing and/or condoning the policies under which the searches of\nPlaintiff and others whom she represents took place.  In addition, Defendants include agents\nand/or employees of Lincoln County, CSI and/or Cornell who ordered, condoned, authorized,\ncovered up, or were otherwise associated with the implementation of the illegal and\nunconstitutional policies and practices of LCDC relating to strip searches complained of\nherein.   \n-8-\n\n13. At all material times mentioned herein, all Defendants were acting under the\ncolor of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and\nusages of the State of New Mexico and/or Lincoln County. \n14. Lincoln County, Cornell, CSI, Holm and/or Jeffers were responsible for the\nscreening, hiring, training, monitoring, supervision and disciplining of subordinate\nemployees of LCDC, and were the authorities empowering LCDC to incarcerate persons \nunder the jurisdiction of Lincoln County.  Lincoln County, Cornell, CSI, Holm and Jeffers\nwere responsible for administering LCDC and for formulating, overseeing, and implementing\nthe policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the LCDC. \n15. Plaintiffโs allegations against Lincoln County are based on acts and omissions\nof Cornell, CSI, Holm, Jeffers and their employees, agents and representatives, as well as on\nacts and omissions of persons who are Lincoln County employees, and on Lincoln Countyโs\nbreach of its duty to protect Plaintiff, and all those she represents, from the wrongful conduct\nof said persons and employees.\n16. Lincoln County, Cornell, and CSI also maintained or permitted an official\npolicy or custom of causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained\nof herein, which wrongs damaged Plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.\n17. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period\nbeginning three years before the filing of the original Complaint herein on August 22, 2005,\nand continuing to this date, were subjected by Defendants to pre-arraignment strip and/or\n-9-\n\nvisual body cavity searches without Defendants having, and recording in writing, a\nreasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.  \nIII.\nFACTS\n18. On or about May 27, 2005, Plaintiff was arrested by New Mexico State Police\nOfficer Samuel Houston near Carrizozo, New Mexico, allegedly on an outstanding warrant\nfor issuing a worthless $16.36 check in Alamogordo, New Mexico.  Plaintiff was transported\nby Officer Houston to LCDC.  Upon arrival at LCDC, and prior to any appearance before a\njudge and without there being any reasonable suspicion that she was concealing contraband,\nPlaintiff, pursuant to policies, practices, and procedures of Defendants, and each of them, was\nsubjected to a strip search and visual body cavity search in violation of the Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 10 of the\nConstitution of the State of New Mexico.  Plaintiff was coerced, forced, and compelled to\ndisrobe for the strip search in an area in which she was observed while naked by persons who\nwere not participating in the search and who were of the opposite sex. \n19. Within ninety days of the aforesaid strip search, Plaintiff submitted a notice\nunder the New Mexico Tort Claims Act for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a\ncopy of said notice is attached hereto as Exhibit โAโ, and incorporated herein to the extent\nrelevant by this reference).  Plaintiffโs group claim was denied on or about July 8, 2005,\nallowing the filing of this class action complaint to include claims against public employees\nfor which immunity has been waived under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.\n-10-\n\n20. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendants\nroutinely followed their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees,\nincluding Plaintiff and all those she represents, to strip and visual body cavity searches\nwithout first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would\nbe productive of contraband or weapons.\n21. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendants have\nthe ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in\nDefendantsโ custody, at LCDC within three years prior to the filing of the original Complaint\nherein on August 22, 2005, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity\nsearches prior to arraignment without Defendants first having, and recording, a reasonable\nsuspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n22. Lincoln County, Cornell, CSI, Holm and/or Jeffers are personally responsible\nfor the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom\npursuant to which Plaintiff, and those she represents, were subjected to strip searches.\n23. As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein,\nPlaintiff, and each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional\ndistress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and state and federal\nstatutory and constitutional rights, and are entitled to recover damages according to proof.\n-11-\n\nIV.\nCLASS CLAIMS\n24. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiff, and all those\nsimilarly situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and\ncustoms of Defendants.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard\nto the nature of the alleged offenses for which Plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, had\nbeen arrested, without regard to whether or not Plaintiff, and those she represents, were\neligible for being cited and released, without regard to whether or not Plaintiff, and those\nsimilarly situated, were eligible for and/or were released on their own recognizance, or on\nbail.  Furthermore, the searches complained of herein were performed without Defendants\nhaving a reasonable belief that Plaintiff, or any of those similarly situated, possessed weapons\nor contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved\ndocument.  The searches complained of herein were performed without Defendants taking\nreasonable precautions to make certain that Plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, was\nnot observed by others not involved in the search.\n25. Plaintiff brings this action on her own behalf and on behalf of all persons\nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n26. The class of plaintiffs is defined to include all persons arrested on charges not\ninvolving violence, drugs or weapons who, in the period from and including three years for\nfederal and New Mexico common law claims and two years for New Mexico Tort Claims\nAct claims prior to the filing of the original Complaint herein on August 22, 2005, and\n-12-\n\ncontinuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices complained of herein cease, were\narrested and subjected to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches at LCDC\nwithout Defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the\nsearches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n27. In accordance with Rule 23(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the members\nof the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiff does not\nknow the exact number of class members.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon\nalleges, that there are three to ten persons per day who were taken into the custody of\nDefendants and who were subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of\nDefendantsโ policy, practice, and custom relating to said searches.  \n28. In accordance with Rule 23(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff is\ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact common\nto the class including, but not limited to:  (1) whether Defendants routinely subjected all\npersons arrested to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment if\nthey intended such persons to be housed in LCDC; (2) whether persons were subjected to\nstrip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment without there being any\nreasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee\nhad concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected\nby means of a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (3) whether the strip and/or visual body\ncavity searches were conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches would not be\n-13-\n\nobserved by persons not participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the strip and/or visual\nbody cavity searches were reasonably related to Defendantsโ penological interest in\nmaintaining the security of the jail and whether or not there were less intrusive methods for\nprotecting any such interest. \n29. In accordance with Rule 23(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff is\ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law common\nto the class including, but not limited to:  (1) whether Defendants may perform strip and/or\nvisual body cavity searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable\nsuspicion based on specific or articulable facts to believe any particular prearraignment\ndetainee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely be discovered\nby a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (2) whether Defendants may perform strip and/or\nvisual body cavity searches on persons without first reasonably relating the strip search of the\nsubject to Defendantsโ penological interest in maintaining the security of the jail and\ndetermining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether strip and/or\nvisual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the search can be observed by\npeople not participating in the search without violating plaintiffsโ state and federal\nconstitutional rights and plaintiffsโ state statutory or common law rights; (4) whether or not\nDefendantsโ strip search policies and procedures are in accordance with the state and/or\nfederal constitutions; (5) whether or not plaintiffsโ state claims are actionable under the\nprovisions of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act; and, (6) whether or not New Mexico has\n-14-\n\nwaived any immunity defense for claims of this type when brought pursuant to the provisions\nof the New Mexico Tort Claims Act. \n30. In accordance with Rule 23(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the claims of\nPlaintiff are typical of the class.  Plaintiff was arrested on a minor offense not involving\nviolence, drugs or weapons and was searched, prior to arraignment, without Defendants\nhaving a reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs,\nweapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated\nin a supervisor-approved writing).  Plaintiff has the same interests and suffered the same type\nof injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiffโs claims arose because of Defendantsโ\npolicy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches\nbefore arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the\nsearch would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Each class member suffered actual\ndamages as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search.  The actual\ndamages suffered by Plaintiff is similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by\neach class member.  \n31. In accordance with Rule 23(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff will\nfairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffโs interests are consistent with and\nnot antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n32. In accordance with Rule 23(b)(1)(A),  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nprosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that\n-15-\n\ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would\nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the complaint.  \n33. In accordance with Rule 23(b)(1)(B),  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nprosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of\ninconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a\npractical matter, substantially impair or impede the ability of other members of the class to\nprotect their interests.\n34. In accordance with Rule 23(b)(2),  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff\nis informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendants have acted on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.  \n35. In accordance with Rule 23(b)(3), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this class\naction is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the\ncontroversy between the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges,\nthat the interests of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a\nseparate action is low, in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute\nany action at all.  Plaintiff also is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the\namounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate suits would be impracticable. \nPlaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that most members of the class will\nnot be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and\n-16-\n\nthereupon alleges, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of\nthe claims arose in Lincoln County.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the\ncommon questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.\n36. Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff is\ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the identities of the class members may be\nascertained from records maintained by Defendants.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and\nthereupon alleges, that Defendantsโ records reflect the identities, including addresses and\ntelephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in LCDC.  Plaintiff is\ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records maintained by Defendants reflect\nwho was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search occurred, where\nthe search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and was\nrecorded in a supervisor-approved writing, whether the search was videotaped, when persons\nsearched were arraigned, and the charges on which such persons were arrested.  Plaintiff is\ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that all of the foregoing information is\ncontained in Defendantsโ computer system and/or in paper files maintained by Defendants\nand that the information necessary to identify the class members, by last known addresses,\nand the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily available\nfrom said computer system and/or documents.  \n37. In accordance with Rule 23(c)(2)(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, class\nmembers must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances,\n-17-\n\nincluding individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. \nPlaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Defendantsโ records contain a\nlast known address for class members.  Plaintiff contemplates that individual notice will be\ngiven to class members at such last known address by First Class U.S. mail.  Plaintiff\ncontemplates that the notice will inform class members of the following:\ni. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class;\nii. The nature of the action;\niii. Their right to โopt outโ of the action within a given time, in which\nevent they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\niv. Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to be represented by their own\ncounsel and to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be\nrepresented by the named class Plaintiff and the named class Plaintiffโs\ncounsel; and \nv. Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to share in any recovery in favor of\nthe class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common\nissues adverse to the class.  \nV.\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Civil Rights Violations Under 42 USC ยง 1983)\n38. Plaintiff incorporates by reference into this cause of action the allegations in\neach of the preceding paragraphs, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein.\n-18-\n\n39.  Defendantsโ policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual\nbody cavity searches complained of herein violated Plaintiffโs, and all those similarly\nsituatedโs, clearly established rights under the Fourth Amendment to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures, violated Plaintiffโs, and all those similarly situatedโs,\nclearly established rights to due process and privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, and\ndirectly and proximately damaged Plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged,\nentitling Plaintiff, and all class members, to recover damages for said constitutional\nviolations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief, for herself and for all persons similarly\nsituated, as hereunder appears.\nVI.\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Claims Arising Under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act\non behalf of Plaintiff and all persons similarly situated)\n \n40. Plaintiff incorporates by reference into this cause of action each of the\nallegations in the preceding paragraphs, as fully as if realleged and set forth herein.\n41. The conduct, policies, practices, and customs of Defendants, described above,\nresulted in personal and bodily injury to Plaintiff, and those she seeks to represent, in that the\nstrip and visual body cavity searches complained of herein violated the rights of Plaintiff, and\nall those similarly situated, to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as secured by\nArticle II, Section 10 of the New Mexico Constitution and directly and proximately damaged\n-19-\n\nPlaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, as herein alleged, entitling said Plaintiff, and\neach of those she represents, to recover damages.  \n42. Holm and Jeffers, as Wardens of LCDC, had the duty in any activity actually\nundertaken by each of them to exercise for the safety of others that care ordinarily exercised\nby a reasonable, prudent, and qualified corrections supervisor in light of the nature of what\nwas being done.  In addition, Holm and Jeffers had a duty to properly screen, hire, train,\nmonitor, supervise, and/or discipline those working at LCDC, including Morales and Vega. \nHolm and Jeffers knew or reasonably should have known of the information described\nherein.\n43. Holm and Jeffers breached the foregoing duties by failing to properly screen,\nhire, train, monitor, supervise, and/or discipline personnel employed at LCDC, and by failing\nto adopt appropriate policies, procedures, and protocols, by failing to implement appropriate\nsupplemental training, by failing to appropriately discipline subordinate officers, and by\nfailing to take other appropriate and usual supervisory actions to correct the problems and to\nprevent the harm which resulted to Plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as a result of the\nacts and omissions of Defendants complained of herein.\n44. Lincoln County is the governmental entity which had immediate supervisory\nresponsibility over the actions of employees and agents of Lincoln County, including, but not\nlimited to, Holm, Jeffers, Morales and Vega.  Therefore, Lincoln County is jointly and\n-20-\n\nseverally liable for all injuries and damages caused by the negligence of any of its municipal\nofficials, employees, or agents under the doctrine of vicarious liability.\n45. The conduct of Defendants, and each of them, was a direct and proximate\ncause of the injuries and damages to Plaintiff, and those she seeks to represent.\n46. All of the acts and/or omissions which constitute the basis for liability herein\ncome within the scope of the waivers of immunity contained within the New Mexico Tort\nClaims Act.\n47. To the extent required, Plaintiff has given written notice of the claims\ncontained herein in compliance with the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, ยง 41-4-16 NMSA\n1978, as amended.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief for herself and for all persons similarly\nsituated, as hereunder appears.\nVII.\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Claims Arising Under New Mexico Common Law\non behalf of Plaintiff and all those similarly situated)\n48. Plaintiff incorporates by reference into this cause of action the allegations in\neach of the preceding paragraphs, to the extent relevant, as fully as if realleged and set forth\nherein.\n49. The acts and omissions of Holm, Jeffers, Morales and Vega, as set forth above,\ngive rise to liability based on assault, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of\nemotional distress.\n-21-\n\n50. The acts and omissions of Holm, Jeffers, Morales and Vega, as set forth above,\noccurred within the course and scope of their employment.  Therefore, Cornell and CSI are\nvicariously liable for all such acts and omissions as well as the resultant injuries and\ndamages. \n51. As a direct and proximate cause of Defendantsโ conduct, Plaintiff, and all those\nsimilarly situated, were damaged as set forth herein.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief for herself and for all persons similarly\nsituated, as hereunder appears.\nVIII.\nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n(Declaratory and Injunctive Relief)\n52. Plaintiff incorporates by reference into this cause of action the allegations in\neach of the preceding paragraphs, to the extent relevant, as fully as if realleged and set forth\nherein.\n53. Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and the members of the class, seeks a judgment\ndeclaring that Defendantsโ strip search policies and procedures violate constitutional rights\nunder the federal and New Mexico constitutions, declaring that Defendants must cease the\nactivities described herein and enjoining Defendants from any further strip searches of pre-\narraignment detainees without individualized reasonable suspicion.\n-22-\n\n54. The constitutional violations alleged herein arise from official policies and\npractices sanctioned by Defendants.  The harm which Plaintiff and the members of the class\nhave sustained are directly traceable to these officially sanctioned policies and procedures.\n55. Plaintiff and members of the class do not have a plain, adequate, speedy, or\ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs alleged herein, and they will suffer irreparable\ninjury as a result of Defendantsโ misconduct unless injunctive and declaratory relief is\ngranted.  Plaintiff and members of the class are in real and immediate danger of sustaining\nfuture, direct injury as a result of Defendantsโ official policies and practices that are ongoing\nat the time of this suit.\n56. No cognizable burden will be placed on Defendants by requiring that no strip\nsearches be undertaken without individualized reasonable suspicion.  The public interest\nwould be greatly enhanced by enforcement of policies and practices which adhere to the\nrequirements of the state and federal Constitutions.  Absent injunctive relief, there is no\nguarantee that the Defendants will permanently cease their illegal policies and practices as\nalleged herein.\n57. By reason of the foregoing, Plaintiff and members of the class are entitled to\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief as set forth above.\nIX.\nDAMAGES\n58. The above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth\nin this paragraph.\n-23-\n\n59. As a direct and proximate result of the wrongful and unlawful actions of\nDefendants, described above, Plaintiff and the members of the class were injured and have\nsuffered and continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to emotional distress,\nanguish, suffering, humiliation, deprivation of constitutional rights, and other incidental,\nconsequential, and special damages.\n60. Defendantsโ acts and omissions, as set forth herein, were malicious, reckless,\nwanton, oppressive, and/or fraudulent, justifying an award of punitive damages under the\nFirst Cause of Action herein against Holm, Jeffers, Morales and Vega, in their individual\ncapacities, and against Cornell and CSI for the purpose of punishment and to deter there\nDefendants and others from the commission of like offenses.  In addition, for the same\nreasons and purposes, said acts and omissions justify an award against Holm, Jeffers,\nMorales, Vega, Cornell and CSI under the Third Cause of Action herein.\nX.\nPRAYER\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and on behalf of the members of the\nclass represented herein, respectfully prays for and demands judgment against Defendants as\nfollows:\n(a) For judgment against Defendants for compensatory damages, special\ndamages, consequential damages and incidental damages under any or\nall of the causes of action, in an amount to be determined at the trial of\nthis cause;\n(b) For judgment declaring the rights of the parties;\n-24-\n\n(c) For injunctive relief;\n(d) For reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs incurred herein pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1988;\n(e) For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest in amounts to be\ndetermined according to law;\n(f) For an award of punitive and exemplary damages in an amount to be\ndetermined at the trial of this cause; and\n(g) For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\nJURY TRIAL REQUEST\nCOMES NOW Plaintiff Sharon Allison, by and through her counsel, below-listed, on\nher own behalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, and hereby demands\ntrial by jury pursuant to the terms and conditions of Rule 38, Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, in regard to all issues in the above-referenced cause.\nRespectfully submitted,\nLAW OFFICE OF MARK E.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO \n                           \nSHARON ALLISON, on behalf of herself\nand the class of similarly situated persons;\nPlaintiffs,\nvs. Civil No. 05-881 WJ/WDS\nLINCOLN COUNTY BOARD OF\nCOMMISSIONERS; CORNELL COMPANIES,\nINC., a Delaware Corporation; CORRECTIONAL\nSYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware Corporation; MIKE\nHOLM, individually and in his official capacity;\nROGER JEFFERS, individually and in his official\ncapacity; PETER MORALES, individually and in\nhis official capacity; LUCY VEGA, individually and\nin her official capacity; LINCOLN COUNTY\nDETENTION CENTER CORRECTIONS\nOFFICERS DOES 1 THROUGH 50 and ROES 1\nTHROUGH 20, inclusive,\nDefendants.\nORDER GRANTING PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\nOF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AND\nCONDITIONALLY CERTIFYING THE CLASS\nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court pursuant to the partiesโ Joint Motion for\nPreliminary Approval of Class Settlement (Doc. 51).  The Court has considered the facts and legal\nauthorities set forth in the motion, the exhibits to the motion and the Supplemental Memorandum\nin Support of Join Motion (Doc. 55).  The Court has also considered the representations of\ncounsel at a hearing conducted on January 30, 2007.  In light of the representations of the parties\nand the relevant law, I conclude with reservations that there is good cause for preliminary\napproval of the class action settlement and for conditionally certifying the class.\n\nPreliminary approval of a proposed class settlement is the first step of a two part process\nrequired for class action settlement.  Manual for Complex Litigation Fourth ยง 21.632 (Fed. Jud.\nCtr. 2004) (hereinafter โManualโ).  While the court must make a fairness determination for\npreliminary approval, at the preliminary stage a court does not undertake a full and complete\nfairness review.  Inter-Op Hip Prosthesis Liability Litigation, 204 F.R.D. 330, 350 (N.D. Ohio\n2001) (citing Manual ยง 30.41 at 236-37 (3rd ed. 1995)).  Generally, a court grants preliminary\napproval โwhere a proposed settlement appears to be the product of serious, informed, non-\ncollusive negotiations, has no obvious deficiencies, does not improperly grant preferential\ntreatment to class representatives or segments of a the class, and falls within the range of possible\n[final] approval.โ  In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litigation, 176 F.R.D. 99, 102\n(S.D.N.Y. 1997) (citing Manual ยง 30.41 (3rd ed. 1995)).  โIn making a preliminary assessment of\nthe fairness of the proposed settlement agreement, the Courtโs intrusion upon what is otherwise a\nprivate consensual agreement negotiated between the parties to a lawsuit must be limited to the\nextent necessary to reach a reasoned judgment that the agreement is not the product of fraud or\noverreaching by, or collusion between, the negotiating parties, and that the settlement, taken as a\nwhole, is fair, reasonable and adequate to all concerned.โ  Inter-Op Hip Litigation, 204 F.R.D. at\n350.  When a settlement is the result of extensive negotiations by experienced counsel, the Court\nshould presume it is fair.  Id. at 351 (citing Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 923 (6th Cir.\n1983); Duhaime v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 177 F.R.D. 54, 68 (D. Mass. 1997); In re\nOrthopedic Bone Screw Prods. Liab. Litig., 176 F.R.D. 158, 184 (E.D. Pa. 1997)).  \nI have carefully reviewed the Stipulation of Settlement, attached to the Joint Motion as\nExhibit A, and the full contents of the record in this case.  In light of the above principles of law, I\n2\n\nconclude that the settlement is the result of informed, serious, arms-length negotiations between\nthe parties with no overreaching, fraud or collusion.  I also conclude that the proposed settlement\nhas no obvious deficiencies and falls within the range of possible final approval.1  Accordingly, I\nwill grant the parties motion for preliminary approval of the settlement.  \nI have also carefully reviewed the proposed Settlement Notices.  The parties propose to\nsend individual notice in English and Spanish to persons identified as potential class members. \nThe parties also propose to publish notice in local newspapers and provide radio announcements\nin both English and Spanish.  This notice meets the due process requirements because it is\nresaonably calculated to reach interested parties, and, to the extent the identity of individual\nparties is known, notice is being mailed individually.  See Mullane v. Hanover Bank & Trust Co.,\n339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950); Dejulius v. Sprint Corp., 429 F.3d 935 (10th Cir. 2005).  The contents\nof the notice inform potential class members of the terms of the class settlement and the options\nof potential class members in a manner that may be understood by the average class member. \nAccordingly, I will approve the proposed settlement notices and authorize their dissemination.\nThe parties have proposed deadlines for publication and mailing of notice to the potential\nclass, for allowing potential class members to opt out of the class, for the filing by potential class\nmembers of objections to settlement, for filing by potential class members of claims and for the\nfairness hearing.  I find these deadlines reasonable and will herein adopt them.  \n1At the hearing on this matter, I ruled that the parties had made a prima facie showing\nsufficient for preliminary approval with regard to the basic settlement agreement and the\nattorneysโ fees provision.  However, I ordered supplemental briefing on the issue of the incentive\naward for the class representative.  While I continue to have reservations about the proposed\nincentive award, there is no obvious deficiency for purposes of the preliminary analysis. \n3\n\nWith regard to conditional certification of the class, a class must meet the following\nprerequisites under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) for certification: โ(1) the class is so numerous that\njoinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;\n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the\nclass; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\nclass.โ  Lopez v. City of Santa Fe, 206 F.R.D. 285, 288 (D.N.M. 2002); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).\nThe proposed Settlement Class in this case consists of approximately 1,200 individuals. \nJoinder of this many persons would be impracticable, and I conclude that the numerosity\nrequirement is met.  The commonality requirement is met if putative class membersโ grievances\nshare a common question of law or fact.  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 288.  The claims on behalf of the\nclass share several common questions of fact and law, and this case is dominated by the common\nissue whether Defendants policies and procedures with regard to strip searches of pre-arraignment\ndetainees violated the rights of the members of the proposed Settlement Class.  Resolving the\nissues with regard to each member of the class would depend largely upon common evidence. \nAccordingly, I conclude that the commonality requirement is met with respect to the proposed\nSettlement Class.\nWith regard to typicality, a plaintiffโs claim is typical โif it arises from the same event or\npractice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and if his or her\nclaims are based on the same legal theory.โ  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. 289.  In this case, the proposed\nclass representative brings claims based on her allegations that, when she was a pre-arraignment\ndetainee at the Lincoln County Detention Center, she was strip searched in violation of her rights. \nShe brings these claims on behalf of the proposed class of persons who were subjected to the\n4\n\nsame practices and course of conduct that gave rise to the alleged class-wide injury at issue. \nAccordingly, the typicality requirement is met.  \nThe purpose of the adequacy requirement is to protect the legal rights of absent class\nmembers.  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 289.  โIn order to adequately represent the class, two\nrequirements must be met: (1) the class representative must not have interests antagonistic to\nthose of the class; and (2) the attorneys representing the class must be qualified, experienced, and\ngenerally able to conduct the proposed litigation.โ  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 289-90.  There is no\nconflict and no antagonistic interests between the proposed class representative and the members\nof the class.  She alleges the same harm arising from the same course of conduct as the members\nof the proposed class.  Based on the record in this case it is clear that proposed class counsel are\nhighly qualified and experienced.  Accordingly, I conclude that the adequacy requirement is met.\nBased on the above, I conclude that the proposed settlement class with the proposed class\nrepresentative meets the requirements Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  Having found this, I must now\nproceed to determine whether the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b) have been met.  Class\ncertification under Rule 23(b) is appropriate when โquestions of law or fact common to the\nmembers of the class predominateโ and โa class action is superior to other available methodsโ of\nadjudicating the controversy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In this case, Plaintiffโs claim meets both\nthe predominance and superiority requirements.  As already noted, the claims of the proposed\nclass all arise from the alleged practice of the Defendants with regard to conducting strip searches\nof pre-arraignment detainees.  The common legal issue whether this conduct violated the rights of\nthe proposed class members predominates in this case, and a common trial of this issue is superior\nto conducting hundreds or even more than a thousand trials over this issue.  Accordingly, I\n5\n\nconclude that the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b) are met and I will conditionally certify the\nclass, appoint Plaintiff as the class representative, and appoint Plaintiffโs counsel as class counsel.\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT:\n1. The Court preliminarily approves the Stipulation of Settlement as fair, reasonable\nand adequate.  Neither this preliminary order of approval nor the Stipulation of Settlement is a\nfinding or an admission by Defendants of any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever.\n2. The Court concludes that (1) the Settlement Class (as that term is defined in the\nStipulation of Settlement) is so numerous that joinder of all member is impracticable, (2) there are\nquestions of law and fact common to the Settlement Class, (3) the claims of the Plaintiff Sharon\nAllison (โPlaintiffโ) are typical of the claims of the Settlement Class, (4) the Plaintiff will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the Settlement Class, (5) the questions of law and fact common\nto the members of the Settlement Class predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and (6) a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\nadjudication of this controversy.\n3. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and the Stipulation of Settlement, the Court hereby\nconditionally certifies a Settlement Class as that term is defined in Paragraph 14 of the Stipulation\nof Settlement.\n4. The Court appoints Sharon Allison as Class Representative.\n5. The Court appoints Mark E. Merin of the Law Office of Mark E. Merin, Andrew\nC. Schwartz of Casper, Meadows Schwartz and Cook, and Robert R. Rothstein of Rothstein,\nDonatelli, Hughes, Daholstrom, Schoenburg & Bienvenu, LLP as Class Counsel.\n6\n\n6. The Court approves the Administrator, as that term is defined in the Stipulation of\nSettlement, to be stipulated to by the parties or to be determined by further order of the Court,\nand authorizes the Administrator to perform those duties as defined in the Stipulation of\nSettlement.\n7. The Court approves the Class Notice in the form attached to the Stipulation of\nSettlement as Exhibit 4.  The Court approves the Claim Form attached to the Stipulation of\nSettlement as Exhibit 3.\n8. Within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, the Defendants shall provide to\nthe Administrator and Class Counsel the โDatabaseโ as that term is defined in Paragraph 8 of the\nStipulation of Settlement and shall transmit by wire transfer or certified funds the Settlement Fund\n(as defined in Paragraphs 27-28 of the Stipulation of Settlement) to the Administrator or the\nAdministratorโs designee for deposit in an interest-bearing qualified settlement fund.\n9. The Administrator is directed to mail the Class Notice and Claim Form (โNotice\nPackageโ) to all members of the Settlement Class as set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement. \nThe Administrator is further directed to publish the Notice as set forth in the Stipulation of\nSettlement and to ensure that announcements are made on the radio as set forth in the Stipulation\nof Settlement.\n10. Such dissemination of the Class Notice is the best notice practicable under the\ncircumstances, within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B).\n11. The Court shall conduct a Final Approval Hearing on  November 1, 2007 at 9:00\na.m. to determine whether the Stipulation of Settlement should be finally approved as fair,\n7\n\nreasonable and adequate to the Settlement Class, and whether judgment should be entered\naccordingly.\n12. Any Settlement Class member who so desires may object to the proposed\nsettlement, or the proposed form of Final Approval, provided that the Class member refrains from\nopting out of the Settlement Class and otherwise complies with the procedures described in the\nClass Notice.\n13. The Final Approval Hearing may be continued or adjourned by order of the Court\nwithout further notice to the Class.\n14. If the Stipulation of Settlement is finally approved by the Court, then upon the\noccurrence of the effective date, all Settlement Class members who do not timely exclude\nthemselves from the Settlement Class โ whether or not they file a timely and valid Claim Form, or\nany claim at all โ shall be barred and enjoined from asserting any of the claims released in the\nStipulation of Settlement, shall conclusively be deemed to have released any and all such claims,\nand shall be subject to and bound by the provisions of the Stipulation of Settlement and the Final\nJudgment.\n15. Until the Court finally determines whether the Stipulation of Settlement should be\napproved, no member of the Settlement Class who has not timely and validly opted out of the\nsettlement may commence or prosecute any action or proceeding in any forum asserting any of\nthe claims that are the subject of the Stipulation of Settlement.\n                                                                      \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n8",

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nSHARON ALLISON, on behalf of herself and the\nclass of similarly situated persons; \nPlaintiffs,\nv. NO. CV 05-881 WPJ/WDS\nLINCOLN COUNTY BOARD OF\nCOMMISSIONERS; CORNELL COMPANIES,\nINC., a Delaware Corporation; CORRECTIONAL\nSYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware Corporation; MIKE\nHOLM, individually and in his official capacity;\nROGER JEFFERS, individually and in his official\ncapacity; PETER MORALES, individually and in\nhis official capacity; LUCY VEGA, individually\nand in her official capacity; LINCOLN COUNTY\nDETENTION CENTER CORRECTIONS\nOFFICERS DOES 1 THROUGH 50 and ROES 1\nTHROUGH 20, inclusive;  \nDefendants.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF JOINT MOTION\nFOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT\nCOMES NOW Plaintiff Sharon Allison (โPlaintiffโ), by and through her counsel,\nbelow-listed, and in response to the Courtโs direction at the hearing on January 30, 2007,\nhereby provides the following supplemental authority in support of the Joint Motion for\nPreliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement.  The Court specifically requested that\nPlaintiff provide additional briefing on the proposed class representative incentive payment\nto Plaintiff in the amount of $100,000.  \n\nClass representative incentive awards are intended to recognize the significant time\nand efforts expended by class representatives on behalf of the class and the risks that they\nundertook in bringing a lawsuit.  Ingram v. The Coca Cola Co., 200 F.R.D. 685, 694 (N.D.\nGa. 2001)(awarding incentive awards of $300,000 to each plaintiff and holding that โcourts\nroutinely approve incentive awards to compensate named plaintiffs for the services they\nprovide and the risks they incurred during the course of the class action litigationโ (quoting\nIn re Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, 175 F.R.D. 270, 272 (S.D. Ohio 1997)); see also,\nHuguley v. Gen. Motors Corp., 128 F.R.D. 81, 85 (E.D. Mich. 1989) (โNamed plaintiffs and\nwitnesses are entitled to more consideration than class members generally because of the\nonerous burden of litigation that they have borne.โ).  In considering incentive awards, the\nCourt may consider the risk to the class representative, financial and otherwise; the personal\ndifficulties encountered by the class representative; the amount of time and effort spent on\nlitigation; the duration of the litigation; and the personal benefitโor lack thereofโenjoyed\nby the class representative as a result of the litigation.  Van Vranken v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,\n901 F. Supp. 294, 299 (N.D. Cal. 1995).  \nIn the present case, these factors weigh in favor of the agreed-upon incentive award\nfor Plaintiff.  She was willing to allow her name to appear on the complaint, which she knew\nwould receive significant publicity.  She made personal sacrifices in order to pursue this case\non behalf of the class.  Plaintiff had a particularly strong individual case that would likely\nhave resulted in a significant award if her case had been pursued individually.  Instead,\n-2-\n\nPlaintiff chose to pursue a recovery that, while less beneficial to her, provided a benefit to\nhundreds of others. \nPlaintiff was required to submit to deposition and other public scrutiny into\nembarrassing details of her personal life, including her arrest.  In addition, she spent hours\nreviewing information provided in discovery, providing information to counsel, participating\nin depositions, answering written discovery, attending mediations, and assisting counsel in\ncountless other ways in the pursuit and eventual settlement of this case. Ultimately, pressures\nassociated with the lawsuit were an important factor in Plaintiffโs decision to move away\nfrom Lincoln County.\n  In addition to the discussion of the class representative incentive award set forth at\npages 9-10 of the Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement [Doc.\nNo. 51], Plaintiff submits the following additional authority in support of the proposed\npayment in this case:\n1. Bull, et al. v. Sacramento County, et al., (Sacramento County Superior Court\nNo. 01 AS 01545, Order and Judgment of Dismissal entered on 10/22/2004). \nIn this class action lawsuit challenging the Sacramento County Jailโs strip\nsearch policies, Plaintiff Mary Bull received a class representative incentive\npayment of $150,000.  A description of the case is set forth in the Affidavit of\nMark Merin, Exhibit โ1\" hereto, and a copy of the Superior Courtโs Order is\nattached as Exhibit โAโ to Mr. Merinโs Affidavit.  The case involved an\n-3-\n\noverall settlement in the amount of $4,924,406.25 and provided for an average\nper claimant payout of $1,499.06. \n2. Haney, et al. v. Miami-Dade County, et al., (United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Case No. 04-20516 CIV,\nAgreed Order and Judgment of Dismissal entered on October 6, 2005).  This\ncase involved a class action challenging the strip search policies of the Miami-\nDade County Corrections and Rehabilitation Department.  Class representative\nMary Haney received a court-approved incentive payment of $135,000.  The\noverall settlement amount of the case was $3,287,740.00 with an average per\nclaim award of $2,515.49.  The case is discussed in Mr. Merinโs Affidavit,\nExhibit โ1\" hereto at page three and a copy of the Courtโs Agreed Order and\nJudgment of Dismissal is attached as Exhibit โBโ to Mr. Merinโs Affidavit.  \n3. Katie Kelley Mareau, et al. v. Regents of the University of California, et al.,\n(First Judicial District Court (County of Santa Fe), No. SF 96-2430 (C), Order\nof January 25, 2002).  This class action arose from State law challenges to the\npractice of Los Alamos National Laboratory in performing autopsies on\ndeceased laboratory employees and other persons without consent of next of\nkin.  Class representative Katie Kelley Mareau received a court-approved\npayment of $75,000 as a class representative.  A copy of the Courtโs Order\nApproving Allocation and Distribution of Settlement Amounts and Award of\n-4-\n\nAttorneys Fees, Litigation Expenses and Incentive Awards is attached hereto\nas Exhibit โ2\".\nAs can be seen from the foregoing examples and the material previously provided to\nthe Court, the sum of $100,000 which has been agreed upon by all parties as part of the\noverall settlement of this case is not without precedent and is justified by the unusual\ncircumstances involved in Plaintiffโs services as class representative in this case.  In addition\nto the information previously provided to the Court, and in supplementation of the points\nraised at the hearing on preliminary approval on January 30, 2007, Plaintiffโs counsel Mark\nE. Merin has set forth additional factors regarding Plaintiffโs service in this case which make\nthe proposed payment of $100,000 reasonable and justified.  That information is set forth in\nMr. Merinโs Affidavit, Exhibit โ1\" hereto at pages 3-5.  As the Court observed at the hearing,\nit took particular courage for Plaintiff to agree to be the sole class representative in what was\na controversial and potentially unpopular cause.\nWHEREFORE, for all of the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that\nthis Court enter its order granting the Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action\nSettlement, including the class representative incentive payment.\n-5-\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nLAW OFFICE OF MARK E.

INTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiff Sharon Allison, representing herself and all others similarly situated in an action \nfiled as a class action, and Defendants LINCOLN COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, \nCORNELL COMPANIES, INC., CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS, INC., MIKE HOLM, ROGER \nJEFFERS, PETER MORALES, and LUCY VEGA, (the Plaintiff and Defendants are referred to \n\ncollectively as โthe Partiesโ), by and through their respective counsel, jointly move the Court for \npreliminary approval of their agreement to settle this case.   \n  The Parties specifically request that this Court enter an Order (1) preliminarily approving \nthe Partiesโ Stipulation of Settlement (attached as Exhibit A) (2) conditionally certifying the \nproposed Settlement Class, (3) appointing the named Plaintiff as Class Representative, (4) \nappointing counsel for Plaintiff as Class Counsel, (5) approving the form and manner of Notice \nto be sent to Settlement Class Members and the Summary Notice to be published in various \nmedia, (6) approving the Claim Form, (7) setting deadlines with respect to, claims, opt outs and \nobjections, and (8) setting a date for a final fairness hearing.   Judicial preliminary approval is \nappropriate where a case settles as a class action before certification.  (Manual for Complex \nLitigation, 4th Ed., ยถ 21.132.)  \n  II.  STATEMENT OF FACTS/HISTORY OF LITIGATION \nA.  Facts \n  On August 22, 2005, Plaintiff Sharon Allison, on behalf of herself and all persons \nsimilarly situated, filed a Complaint in the above-captioned matter in which she challenged, \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and New Mexico state law, certain practices of Defendants \nincluding the strip search of certain detainees at the Lincoln County Detention Center, prior to \narraignment, and sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.  The Complaint was \nsubsequently amended to add additional named Defendants discovered following the filing of the \ninitial Complaint.  The First Amended Complaint was filed on June 28, 2006.   \n  2\n\n  As a result of discovery initiated by the Parties which included exchange of documents, \ninterrogatories, and depositions, it was discovered that, until Defendant Cornell issued revised \npolicies for the Lincoln County Detention Center on August 31, 2005, correctional officers \nworking at the Lincoln County Detention Center routinely strip searched all pre-arraignment \ndetainees before admitting those detainees to the secure portion of the facility.    From a \nstatistical sampling of the files of approximately 3,000 persons booked at Lincoln County \nDetention Center during the period from August 22, 2002, until August 31, 2005, the Parties \nestimate that approximately 1,200 persons who were arrested on charges not involving violence, \ndrugs or weapons, were strip searched prior to arraignment during their booking at the Lincoln \nCounty Detention Center  \n  On July 12 and 13, 2006, the Parties participated in a mediation, presided over by Paul \nBardacke of the firm Sutin, Thayer & Browne, PC, and, following mediation, arrived at an \nagreed Stipulation of Settlement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  That \nStipulation of Settlement defines the โSettlement Classโ and provides a method to notify \nmembers of the class of the terms of the proposed settlement and their entitlement to receive \ncompensation under the settlement, to object to the settlement at a fairness hearing before this \nCourt, or to opt out of the settlement.   \nB.  Terms Of The Settlement \n  The terms of the settlement, fully described in the Stipulation of Settlement attached \nhereto as Exhibit A, are summarized as follows. \n \n  3\n\n1.  Certification Of The Class \n    The Settlement Class is defined in the Stipulation of Settlement as โall persons \narrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, on or between August 22, 2002, \nand August 31, 2005, who were strip searched at the Lincoln County Detention Center prior to \narraignment.โ  The Parties estimate that there are approximately 1,200 Settlement Class \nMembers (โSCMsโ).   The Parties agree that the action should be conditionally certified as a \nclass action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23.   \n2.  Monetary Relief To Settlement Class Members (SCMs) \na.  Payment to the Settlement Class   \n  The Stipulation of Settlement provides that Defendants will deposit a settlement fund of \n$1,600,000.00 into an interest earning qualified settlement fund account within 30 days of the \ndate of this Courtโs preliminary approval.  At least $750,000.00 will be available for distribution \nto qualified claimants with the possibility that additional funds will be added to those available \nfor distribution if the cost of claims administration is less than the $150,000.00 allocated to cover \nthe costs of such administration.  The Claims Administrator will pay out of the Settlement Fund \nto each SCM who submits a valid and timely Claim Form a pro-rata share of the amount of the \nSettlement Fund available for payment of claims, determined by the Claims Administrator after \nthe submission of all qualified claims.  If 25% of those persons eligible for payment submit a \nClaim Form, each claimant will receive approximately $2,300.00.   \n \n \n  4\n\nb.  Incentive Payment \n  Under the Stipulation of Settlement, the Class Representative will receive $100,000.00 \nfor her contribution to the investigation and prosecution of this case which also includes payment \nfor the particular emotional distress she experienced as a result of being strip searched at the \nLincoln County Detention Center.   Defendants have agreed not to oppose this request.  \n   c.  Equitable Relief \n  The Parties have agreed that the strip search policies at the Lincoln County Detention \nCenter were changed after Plaintiff filed this lawsuit and, therefore, Plaintiffโs  request for \nequitable relief is moot. (A copy of the revised strip search policies is attached as Exhibit 1 to the \nStipulation of Settlement). \n   d.  Attorneysโ Fees & Costs \n  Under the Stipulation of Settlement, $600,000.00 of the Settlement Fund will be allocated \nto pay Plaintiffsโ attorneysโ fees, gross receipts tax on fees and litigation expenses, subject to \napproval of the Court.   Defendants have agreed not to oppose this request.  \n   e.  Release of Claims \n  The Plaintiff and SCMs who do not opt out of the settlement will release the Defendants \nfrom any and all claims which are based upon or could be based upon or arise from the facts \nalleged in this lawsuit.  The full terms of the release are set forth in paragraph 19 of the \nStipulation of Settlement. \n \n \n  5\n\n    f.  Notice and Opt Out Procedures \n  The Stipulation of Settlement provides for a detailed Notice to be sent by mail to all \nSCMs informing them (in English and Spanish) of their rights under the Stipulation of \nSettlement and for a summary Notice (in English and Spanish) to be published in local \nnewspapers informing SCMs of the settlement and directing them to sources of additional \ninformation.  In addition, announcements summarizing the settlement are to be made in English \nand Spanish on local radio stations.   \n  The Stipulation of Settlement provides that SCMs have two options for responding to the \nNotice.  An SCM may (1) remain an SCM and be eligible to submit a Claim Form or (2) request \nexclusion from the Settlement Class and opt out.  SCMs who request exclusion from the \nSettlement Class and opt out will not be deemed to have released the Defendants from any \nclaims and may pursue any claims they have against the Defendants, but will not receive any \npayments from the Settlement Fund.  SCMs who do nothing will be deemed to have released \ntheir claims but will receive  no payment from the Settlement Fund.  SCMs who submit claims \nwill be eligible to receive payments from the Settlement Fund as specified in the Stipulation of \nSettlement and as calculated by the Claims Administrator.  SCMs who do not elect to opt out \nmay also present objections to the Court at the final fairness hearing.   \n   g.  Claims Administration \n  Up to $150,000.00 will be allocated to cover the costs of claims administration, including \nlocating members of the class, providing notice to the class,  and processing/paying the SCMsโ \n  6\n\nclaims.  Any unused amount of this $150,000.00 shall revert to the Settlement Fund benefiting \nSCMs and be distributed to them, pro-rata.   \n  III.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Settlement Agreement Merits Preliminary Approval \n  Preliminary approval of a proposed settlement is part of a two-step process required \nbefore a class action can be settled.  Manual for Complex Litigation Fourth (hereinafter \nโManualโ) ยง 21.632 (Fed. Jud. Ctr. 2004).  In considering preliminary approval, courts make a \npreliminary evaluation of the fairness of the settlement.  โWhere the proposed settlement appears \nto be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations, has no oblivious deficiencies, \ndoes not improperly grant preferential treatment to class representatives or segments of the class \nand falls within the range of possible approval, preliminary approval is granted.โ  In re NASDAQ \nMarket-Makers Antitrust Litig., 176 F.R.D. 99, 102 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); see also Manual ยง 21.632.  \nโOnce preliminary approval is bestowed, the second step of the process ensues: notice is given to \nthe class members [of the terms of the proposed settlement and of a hearing] at which class \nmembers and the settling parties may be heard with respect to final court approval.โ  NASDAQ, \n176 F.R.D. at 102; Manual at ยงยง 21.633-34.  \n  In considering whether to grant a motion for preliminary approval of a proposed \nsettlement agreement, the Court utilizes a โthreshold inquiryโ intended merely to reveal \nconspicuous defects.  In re Inter-Op Hip Prosthesis Liability Litig., 204 F.R.D. 330, 337-38 \n(N.D. Ohio 2001).  Ultimately, of course, before a settlement can be fully approved, the Court \nmust determine that a settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Jones v. Nuclear Pharmacy, \n  7\n\nInc., 741 F.2d 332, 324 (10th Cir. 1984).  At the preliminary approval stage, however, the Court \nshould evaluate, based on the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, the contents of the record, \nand the controlling legal authority whether โthe proposed settlement is sufficiently reasonable, \nadequate, fair and consistent with the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 to warrant notice . . . to \nthe class members and a fairness hearing.โ  Marcus v. Kan. Depโt of Revenue, 206 F.R.D. 509, \n513 (D. Kan. 2002). \n  Considering the issues, evidence, and nature of the settlement negotiations, preliminary \napproval is appropriate in this case.  First, the proposed settlement was the culmination of a \nseries of informed, non-collusive negotiations.  Settlement discussions began during the \ndiscovery process, were adversarial in nature, and involved all of the parties with varying \ninterests.  After the matter was referred to mediation, the parties prepared mediation briefs and \nspent two days negotiating settlement with the assistance of a very experienced mediator, Paul \nBardacke of the firm Sutin, Thayer and Brown, P.C.  Following mediation, the parties and their \nrepresentatives continued negotiations until they arrived at the agreed Stipulation of Settlement.  \nThe course of settlement negotiations rises well above the threshold for preliminary approval.   \n  Second, the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate to \nresolve the dispute.  Liability was serious contested.  Both sides developed evidence to support \ntheir claims and defenses.  Plaintiff believes her class would have been certified.  Defendants \nbelieve they would have defeated class certification and, in any event, would have been \npermitted to defend claims on an individual basis.  All Parties predicted protracted litigation.  \nMost courts, in considering approval of a class action settlement, note the advantages of avoiding \n  8\n\nlengthy and expensive litigation.  See, e.g., Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268, \n1276 (9th Cir. 1992) (recognizing โthe strong judicial policy that favors settlements, particularly \nwhere complex class action litigation is concernedโ); Wald v. Wolfsom (In re United States Oil \nand Gas Litig.), 967 F.2d 489, 493 (11th Cir. 1992) (โComplex litigation . . . can occupy a courtโs \ndocket for years on end, depleting the resources of the parties and the taxpayers while rendering \nmeaningful relief increasingly elusiveโ).  The Parties here recognized the advantages of \nsettlement over continued litigation. \n  The Settlement Fund established here is a meaningful benefit to SCMs.  Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel, who are experienced in this type of litigation, believe the Class Membersโ chances of \nobtaining better results by continuing the litigation or by pursuing separate claims are uncertain \nat best.  (Exhibit B, Merin Affidavit.)  Duhaime v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 177 F.R.D. \n54, 69 (D. Mass 1997) (approving settlement agreement and noting that settlement โprovides \nclass members with timely relief without having to risk the uncertainty of outcome, duration, and \nexpense inherent in continuing the litigationโ). \n  Finally, the Stipulation of Settlement does not grant unduly preferential treatment to the \nClass Representative or segments of the class.  NASDAQ, 176 F.R.D. at 102.  In this instance, \nthrough non-collusive negotiation, the Stipulation of Settlement includes an incentive award of \n$100,000 to the Class Representative.  Plaintiff submits that the proposed incentive award is \nreasonable and is intended to recognize the significant time and efforts expended by Plaintiff \nSharon Allison on behalf of the Class and the risks she undertook in bringing this lawsuit.  \nIngram v. The Coca Cola Co., 200 F.R.D. 685, 694 (N.D. Ga. 2001) (โCourts routinely approve \n  9\n\nincentive awards to compensate named plaintiffs for the services they provide and the risks they \nincurred during the course of the class action litigationโ, quoting In re Southern Ohio \nCorrectional Facility, 175 F.R.D. 270, 272 (S.D. Ohio 1997)).  The Class Representative \ncontributed substantial time and energy in support of the action, including extensive participation \nin discovery, case strategy, case management, and mediation.  Van Vranken v. Atlantic Richfield \nCo., 901 F.Supp 294, 299 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (in considering an incentive award, the court may \nconsider the risk to the class representatives, both financial and otherwise: the personal \ndifficulties encountered by the class representatives; the amount of time and effort spent on \nlitigation; the duration of the litigation; and the personal benefit โ or lack thereof โ enjoyed by \nthe class representative as a result of the litigation).  Given her contribution throughout this \nlitigation, Plaintiff contends that the individual payment to Sharon Allison of $100,000 is not \nexcessive.  Cf. Ingram, 200 F.R.D. at 694 (approving $300,000 incentive award to each named \nplaintiff).  The Defendants have agreed not to oppose the amount proposed to be paid to Plaintiff \nAllison as an incentive.   \nB.  The Court Should Appoint Class Representative And Class Counsel And \nConditionally Certify The Class \n \n  The instant case, which alleges that the Defendantsโ practices affected a large group of \nindividual detainees in the Lincoln County Detention Center is exactly the sort of dispute that \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23 is designed to remedy.  For that reason, the Parties urge the Court to appoint \nClass Representative and Class Counsel, and to conditionally certify the Class under Rule 23.  \nCourts have regularly certified classes of a similar nature.  See, e.g., Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 \n  10\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004) (upholding certification of class of arrestees challenging countiesโ alleged \npolicies of conducting routine strip searches of all pre-arraignment detainees); Blihovde v. St. \nCroix County, Wis., 219 F.R.D. 607 (W.D. Wis. 2003) (certifying class of persons strip searched \nat county jail); Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000) (certifying class of pre-\narraignment detainees to strip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion); Bull v. San \nFrancisco, USDC, N.D. C 03-1840 CRB (Order of 6/10/04) (certifying class of persons strip \nsearched and/or placed in safety cells at county jail); Gallagher v. San Mateo, USDC, N.D. C 04-\n0448 SBA (Order of 10/31/05) (certifying class of persons strip searched at county jail); Leyba v. \nSanta Fe County Board of Commissioners, USDC, D.N.M. CIV-05-0036 BB/ACT (Order of \n7/24/06) (certifying class of persons strip searched prior to arraignment at county jail).  Because \nPlaintiff meets all of the technical requirements of Rule 23, and because it is fair and efficient to \nresolve all claims together, the Court should conditionally certify the Class in this case. \n1.  The Court Should Appoint The Class Representative And Class Counsel \n  This Motion seeks appointment of named Plaintiff Sharon Allison as the Class \nRepresentative.  She is an appropriate representative because she was subjected to the same \npolicy and practices that allegedly violated the rights of all of the other Class members.  \nFurthermore, Plaintiff has acted in the best interest of the Class and has no conflict of interest \nwhich would preclude her from serving as the Class Representative. \n  The Motion also seeks appointment of Mark E. Merin of the Law Office of Mark E. \nMerin, Andrew C. Schwartz of the law firm of Casper, Meadows, Schwartz & Cook, and Robert \nR. Rothstein of the firm Rothstein, Donatelli, Hughes, Dahlstrom, Schoenburg & Bienvenu, \n  11\n\nLLP, as Class Counsel.  These lawyers are all experienced in the areas of civil rights law and \nclass action litigation of strip search cases, and none has any conflict of interest which would \npreclude him from serving as Class Counsel.  All of these lawyers have been involved in this \nlitigation from the time the lawsuit was filed, and all have participated in the negotiations that led \nto the Stipulation of Settlement.  (Exhibit B, Affidavit of Mark Merin; Exhibit C, Affidavit of \nAndrew C. Schwartz; Exhibit D, Affidavit of Robert R. Rothstein.) \n2.  The Proposed Settlement Class Meets The Requirements Of Rule 23(A) \n  A class must have the following prerequisites in order to be certified under Fed.R.Civ.P. \n23(a): โ(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are \nquestions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative \nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.โ  Lopez v. City of Santa Fe, 206 F.R.D. \n285, 288 (D.N.M. 2002) (certifying settlement class); Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a).  Here the proposed \nClass clearly satisfies all of the Rule 23(a) requirements. \na.  The Class Is So Numerous That Joinder Is Impracticable \n  The Settlement Class in this case is estimated to include approximately 1,200 individuals.  \n(See Exhibit B, Merin Affidavit.)  Joinder of so many individual members would be \nimpracticable, and accordingly, this Court should find that the numerosity requirement of Rule \n23(a) is satisfied in this case.  See 1 H. Newberg & A. Conte, Newberg on Class Actions ยง 3.5, at \n246 (4th ed. 2002) (in most cases where class size numbers in the hundreds, numerosity is not an \nissue). \n  12\n\n   b.  There Are Questions Of Law And Fact Common To The Class \n  The commonality requirement is met if putative class membersโ grievances share a \ncommon question of law or fact.  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 288.  โCommonality requires only a \nsingle issue common to the class, and the fact that the claims of individual class members may \ndiffer factually should not preclude certification under Rule 23(b)(2) of a claim seeking the \napplication of a common policy.โ  Id. at 289 (internal quotations marks & citations omitted); see \nalso Adamson v. Bowen, 855 F.2d 668, 676 (10th Cir. 1988). \n  The claims on behalf of the Class before the Court share numerous common questions of \nfact and law.  Most importantly, the case is dominated by the factual and legal questions of \nwhether the Defendantsโ policies and procedures with respect to strip searches of pre-\narraignment detainees violated the rights of the SCMs.  Resolving these questions would depend \nin large part upon evidence that would apply to the Settlement Class as a whole.  Thus, the Rule \n23(a)(2) commonality requirement is satisfied. \nc.   Plaintiffsโ Claims Are Typical Of The Settlement Class And There  \nAre No Conflicts \n \n  The proposed Class Representative presents claims that are typical of those of the \nSettlement Class.  โA . . . plaintiffโs claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or \ncourse of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and if his or her claims are \nbased on the same legal theory.โ  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 289 (internal quotation marks & citations \nomitted); see also In re American Medical Systems, Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1082 (6th Cir. 1996) \n(citing Newberg on Class Actions ยง 3.13, at 3-76 (3d. ed 1992). \n  13\n\n  In this case, the proposed Class Representative claims that she was strip searched in \nviolation of her rights.  (Amended Complaint ยถ 18.)  These claims are also brought on behalf of \nthe Settlement Class.  (Amended Complaint ยถยถ 24-26.)  The Amended Complaint alleges that \nnamed Plaintiff Sharon Allisonโs claims arise out of the same events, practices and course of \nconduct that give rise to the alleged class-wide injury at issue.  (Amended Complaint at ยถยถ 28-\n30.)  As such, it is manifest that the typicality requirement is met. \nd.  The Class Representative Has Fairly And Adequately Protected The  \nInterests Of The Settlement Class \n \n  The purpose of the adequacy of representation requirement is to โprotect the legal rights \nof absent class members.โ  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 289 (internal quotation marks & citations \nomitted); see also Kirkpatrick v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 827 F.2d 718, 721 (11th Cir. 1987).  โIn \norder to adequately represent the class, two requirements must be met: (1) the class \nrepresentative must not have interests antagonistic to those of the class, and (2) the attorneys \nrepresenting the class must be qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed \nlitigation.โ  Lopez, 206 F.R.D. at 289-9; see also Retired Chicago Police Assโn v. City of \nChicago, 7 F.3d 584, 598 (7th Cir. 1993); Cross v. Natโl Trust Life Ins. Co., 553 F.2d 1026, 1031 \n(6th Cir. 1977). \n  The first requirement, an absence of any conflict between the Class Representative and \nthe Settlement Class, is satisfied because both the Class Representative and the SCMs allege they \nhave been harmed by the Defendantsโ allegedly unlawful practices.  Because the Class \nRepresentative and the SCMs have allegedly suffered harm as a result of the Defendantsโ \n  14\n\npractices, there are no antagonistic or conflicting interests that would prevent the Class \nRepresentatives from safeguarding the rights of absent SCMs. \n  The second requirement is also met.  Counsel for the Plaintiffs are qualified and \nexperienced in class action and civil rights litigation.  (Exhibits B, C & D, Merin, Schwartz & \nRothstein Affidavits.)  Class Counsel have diligently pursued this case on behalf of the Named \nPlaintiff and absent SCMs and are continuing to do so.  Thus, the adequacy requirement is met. \n  3.  The Proposed Settlement Class Satisfied The Rule 23(B) Requirements \n  Once the Court finds that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, the Court must \ndetermine whether or not the action is maintainable as a class action under one or more \nprovisions of Rule 23(b).  See, e.g., Senter v. Gen. Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 525 (6th Cir. \n1976).)  Class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate when โquestions of law or fact \ncommon to the members of the class predominateโ and โa class action is superior to other \navailable methodsโ of adjudicating the controversy.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3); Wilfong v. Rent A \nCenter, Inc.,  2001 WL 1795093 (S.D. Ill. 2001) at *7-8.  Here, Plaintiffโs claim is properly \ncertified under Rule 23(b)(3) because Plaintiff satisfies both the โpredominanceโ and the \nโsuperiorityโ requirements.  To satisfy the predominance requirements.  Plaintiff must show that \none or more common issues predominate over individual issues and that one trial of common \nissues is superior to conducting literally hundreds or thousands of separate trials.  Fed.R.Civ.P. \n23(b)(3).  The primary purpose of Rule 23(b)(3) is to promote efficiency and to take advantage \nof the economy that results from jointly adjudicating a large number of claims that share one or \nmore common questions.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 Advisory Committee Notes, 1966 Amendments; see \n  15\n\nalso Sterling v. Velsicol Chemical Corp., 855 F.2d 1188, 1196 (6th Cir. 1988) (goal of Rule \n23(b)(3) is โto achieve the economies of time, effort, and expenseโ). \nโCommon issues predominate within the meaning of Rule 23(b)(3) when they constitute \na significant part of the litigation.โ  Wilfong, 2001 WL 1795093 at *8; see also Jenkins v. \nRaymark Industries, Inc., 782 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir. 1986).  The predominance requirement \naddresses efficiency by making certain that class wide issues outweigh individual issues.  See \nSterling, 855 F.2d at 1197.  The claims in the present case are based on what Plaintiff alleges to \nbe a single course of conduct: the Defendantsโ policy of strip searching all pre-arraignment \ndetainees without individualized reasonable suspicion.  Thus, Plaintiffs face a common set of \nfactual and legal issues and a common cause of injury that predominates over individual \nquestions. \n  Moreover, since all SCMs have the right to opt out of the settlement, there is nothing that \nprevents any Plaintiff from continuing to prosecute his or her claim for monetary relief \nindividually.  See, e.g., In re Inter-Op Hip Prosthesis Liab. Litig., 204 F.R.D. 330, 347 (N.D. \nOhio 2001); Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)(A).  Further, the relief provided in the Stipulation of \nSettlement would not be available in the absence of the class treatment.  See Hip Prosthesis, 204 \nF.R.D. at 347-48.   \nC.  The Court Should Approve The Proposed Settlement Notices And Authorize Their \nDissemination \n \n  โ[I]n any proceeding [that] is to be accorded finality,โ due process requires that interested \nparties be provided with โnotice reasonably calculated, under . . . the circumstances, to apprise \n  16\n\n[them] of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.โ  \nMullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).  The notice must be \nreasonably calculated to reach interested parties and where the names and addresses of the \ninterested parties are known, due process requires mailed notices.  Id. at 318-19; Dejulius v. \nSprint Corp., 429 F.3d 935 (10th Cir. 2005). \n  The contents of class notice must โfairly apprise the . . . members of the class of the terms \nof the proposed settlement and of the options that are open to them in connection with [the] \nproceedings.โ  Maywalt v. Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co., 67 F.3d 1072, 1079 (2d Cir. 1995) \n(quoting Weinberger v. Kendrick, 698 F.2d 61, 70 (2d Cir. 1982)).  Class notice is sufficient if it \nโmay be understood by the average . . . class member.โ  In re Nissan Motor Corp. Antitrust \nLitig., 552 F.2d 1088, 1104 (5th Cir. 1997); see also Churchill Village LLC v. Gen. Elec., 361 \nF.3d 566, 575 (9th Cir. 2004) (โnotice is satisfactory if it generally describes the terms of the \nsettlement in sufficient detail to alert those with adverse viewpoints to investigate and to come \nforward and be heard.โ) (internal quotation marks & citation omitted). \n  Here, the proposed notices (Exhibits 3 and 4 to the Stipulation of Settlement attached \nhereto as Exhibit A) and their method of dissemination provided in paragraphs 6, 49, 50 and 51 \nof the Stipulation of Settlement meet these requirements.  The proposed notices clearly and \nconcisely inform SCMs of all the relevant aspects of the litigation: (a) the Class definition and \nstatement of claims; (b) the litigation history; (c) the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement; (d) \nthe binding effect of any judgment approving the Settlement on those who do not opt out; (e) the \nright to object to the Settlement and the procedure for doing so; (g) whom to contact to obtain \n  17\n\nadditional information regarding the Settlement or the litigation; (h) the amount of compensation \nrequested for the Class Representative to compensate her for her services to the Class; and (i) the \namount requested for reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs.  Thus, the notices provide all the \ninformation necessary for SCMs to make an informed decision with respect to whether to remain \nin or opt out of the Settlement Class or whether to object to the proposed Settlement.  Further, \ndelivery by first class mail to the SCMsโ last known addresses is designed to reach the members \nin the most expeditious and economical way.  In addition, summary notice of the Settlement will \nbe published in local newspapers and will be broadcast on three radio stations in order to notify \nSCMs who are not notified of the Settlement through other means. \nD.  The Court Should Schedule A Fairness Hearing And Approve The Proposed \nSchedule For The Mailing Of Settlement Notices, The Return Of Opt Outs, And The \nFiling Of Objections \n \n  The Parties propose the following sequence of events and deadlines, assuming the Court \ngrants this Motion for Preliminary Approval: \n  Publications and Mailing of     Within thirty (30) days after preliminary approval \nNotice Package to Class:    of the Stipulation of Settlement \n \n  Opt Out Deadline:      120 days after preliminary approval of the \nStipulation of Settlement  \n \n  Objections to Settlement:    120 days after preliminary approval of the \nStipulation of Settlement  \n \n  Claims Deadline:     120  days after preliminary approval of the \nStipulation of Settlement \n \n  Fairness Hearing:     At  least 150 days after preliminary approval of the \nStipulation of Settlement \n \n  18\n\n  IV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Parties respectfully request that the Court issue its Order, \nsubstantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E. \n(1)  Preliminarily approving the Stipulation of Settlement; \n(2)  Conditionally certifying the proposed Settlement Class; \n(3)  Appointing Named Plaintiff as Class Representative; \n(4)  Appointing counsel for Named Plaintiff herein as Class Counsel; \n(5)  Approving the form and manner of Notice to be sent to SCMs and Summary \nNotice to be published in various media in accordance with the Stipulation of \nSettlement; \n(6)  Approving the Claim Form and setting deadlines with respect to, claims, opt outs, \nand objections; and \n(7)  Setting a date for a formal fairness hearing. \nDATED:  October 25, 2006  Respectfully submitted,     \n \nLAW OFFICE OF MARK E.
