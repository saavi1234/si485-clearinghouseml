The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for damages for Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment violations stemming from a compulsory strip search and alleged false arrest. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that he was touched by the searching officer, and was unlawfully arrested during a traffic stop.</p><p>On January 30, 1997, Plaintiff was driving with a passenger who was the owner of the car when he was pulled over by a state trooper in Brewster, New York.  Narcotics and hypodermic needles were found in the trunk of the car, and both occupants denied ownership. The Plaintiff and passenger were both arrested and taken back to a New York State Police Barracks, where Plaintiff was strip searched, and the arresting officer ordered him to spread his buttocks, while another officer probed him.  Thereafter the passenger claimed the narcotics and hypodermic needles were his.  Plaintiff was released, and he was never charged with a crime.</p><p>On January 18th and 19th, 2000, a jury trial was held. The court granted Judgment as a Matter of Law on the false arrest claim at the close of the plaintiff's case.  The jury returned a verdict against the defendant for $125,000.</p><p>On March 23, 2000, the Court (Judge McMahon) ruled on the Defendant's post trial motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and Remittitur.  The Court found that while JMOL was inappropriate, the verdict was excessive and remitted the damages to $25,000. The case was closed on September 5, 2000. </p><p></p>",

New York.\nMarch 23, 2000.\n355 *355 Solomon Abrahams, Lawyers Legal Service Plan, P.C., Attorney for Plaintiff, White Plains, NY, for Plaintiff.\n356 Stacy Sabbatini, AAG, Charles Sanders, AAG, Office of Attorney General of the *356 State of New York, White\nPlains, NY, for Defendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR\nJUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW AND GRANTING DEFENDANT'S\nMOTION FOR REMITTITUR OF THE JURY AWARD OR, IN THE\nALTERNATIVE, A NEW TRIAL.\nMcMAHON, District Judge.\nPlaintiff, Eugene Kelleher, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for damages he sustained as a result of a strip\nsearch conducted by the Defendant, Denzil Fearon, a New York State Trooper. The case was tried to a jury on\nJanuary 18-19, 2000. The jury found that the Defendant was liable under Section 1983 for the deprivation of\nPlaintiff's constitutional rights and that Defendant was not entitled to qualified immunity. The jury awarded Plaintiff\n$125,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress.\nDefendant has moved for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial or remittitur.\nFactual Background\nPlaintiff commenced this action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for alleged violations of his civil rights guaranteed by the\nFourth Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that defendant, acting under color of\nstate law, violated his constitutional right to be free from unlawful search and seizure during a 1997 vehicle traffic\nstop and automobile search, and the resulting arrest and subsequent strip search of the Plaintiff. Prior to the trial,\nall but Plaintiff's claims of false arrest and unlawful strip search were dismissed and/or dropped from the case.\nThe case was tried to a jury on January 18 and 19, 2000. Plaintiff called three witnesses: Plaintiff; Reza Kusani;\nand Dr. Philip Barone. Defendant called two witnesses: Defendant and Trooper George Pearce, the other state\ntrooper present at the traffic stop and search.\nKelleher's Testimony\nMr. Kelleher testified that, on January 30, 1997, he was riding in the passenger seat of a car owned and driven by\nhis friend, Reza Kusani, when the car was pulled over by a New York State Trooper patrol car on Route 6 in\nBrewster, New York. Trooper George Pearce was the first officer on the scene. He asked for Mr. Kusani's\nidentification. Mr. Kusani complied. Trooper Pearce took Mr. Kusani's identification back to the patrol car, during\nwhich time a second trooper arrived. That trooper was Defendant, Denzil Fearon.\n\nMr. Kelleher testified that, while he was still seated in Mr. Kusani's car, Trooper Fearon approached him while he\n(Kelleher) was sitting in Kusani's car and asked for identification. Trooper Pearce asked Kusani to step out of the\nvehicle, and Trooper Fearon asked Kelleher to step out of the vehicle. After Plaintiff stepped out of the vehicle,\nTrooper Fearon walked over to Trooper Pearce, who was standing at the rear of Kusani's vehicle. The two\nTroopers remained at the rear of Kusani's vehicle for a couple of minutes. Then Trooper Fearon walked back to\nwhere Plaintiff was standing and placed him in handcuffs.\nPlaintiff testified that the handcuffs were too tight, and that he experienced pain in his arms and back when he\nwas placed in the back of the patrol car while wearing the handcuffs. Defendant Fearon transported plaintiff to the\nNew York State Police Barracks in Brewster, New York. At the barracks, Trooper Fearon conducted a strip search\nof the plaintiff in a bathroom. Complying with the Trooper's request, Plaintiff disrobed. Trooper Fearon went\nthrough plaintiff's clothing, including his pockets. Trooper Fearon put on surgical gloves, asked Plaintiff to bend\nover and spread his \"rectum cheeks.\" Plaintiff stated that when he complied with Fearon's request, Fearon\n357 touched him and \"he kind of spread it a little further.\" *357 Plaintiff said that during the strip search he felt\n\"violated,\" \"humiliated\" and \"scared.\"\nPlaintiff testified that when the strip search was over, Fearon said, \"Get dressed and get out of here.\" Plaintiff was\nnever charged with a crime.\nPlaintiff did not suffer from any physical trauma as a result of the strip search. He testified that he suffered from\nemotional injuries, including headaches and loss of sleep for an unspecified period. He further testified that for\nsome time after the strip search he \"was an emotional wreck.\" A few days after the strip search, Plaintiff sought\nmedical treatment at Putnam Hospital Center Emergency Room. He complained to the emergency room\nphysician of a persistent headache and pain in his shoulders, upper back and neck. On cross-examination,\nPlaintiff admitted that he had sought medical treatment for headaches prior to the date of the strip search. Plaintiff\nadmitted also that he never sought or received any professional treatment for his alleged emotional distress,\neither from a professional therapist or from a member of the clergy.\nKusani's Testimony\nPlaintiff's second witness was Reza Kusani, whose deposition was read in to the record at trial because he was\nunavailable. Kusani testified that, after he was pulled over, two troopers searched his car. He testified that\nTrooper Pearce, the first officer, began the search, and that the second officer assisted him in the search. Kusani\ntestified that it was Fearon, the second officer at the scene, who discovered a hypodermic needle in the trunk. It\nwas after the needle was discovered that he was placed under arrest. The car search continued and the officers\nturned up a pouch with narcotic substances (pills), also in the trunk. He further testified that after the items were\ndiscovered, the officers continued to search his car for about thirty minutes before he was taken to the barracks.\nKusani testified that all of the medications that were in the trunk of his car were prescribed to him, with the\nexception of some pills he had purchased in Turkey for the treatment of diarrhea. Kusani testified that Trooper\nPearce asked him about the needle and the narcotics. He testified that he told Pearce that everything in the car\nbelonged to him and that \"Mr. Kelleher had nothing to do with whatever was inside of the vehicle.\" (Tr. 123.)\nKusani testified that he discussed with Pearce the nature of the pills in the pouch and that he had been using the\nhypodermic needle for treating a cyst in his mouth. Kusani testified that he made these statements at the scene,\nbefore he and Plaintiff were taken to the barracks.\nDr. Barone's Testimony\nPlaintiff's third witness, Dr. Philip Barone, is Plaintiff's chiropractor. He testified that Plaintiff suffered from pains in\nhis neck and back, which the Doctor testified he had diagnosed as resulting from the handcuffing during\nKelleher's arrest Dr. Barone testified that Plaintiff did not tell him of any previous medical history with respect to\nthe same injuries. Plaintiff testified at trial that he had been to Phelps Memorial Hospital 20 days before the\narrest, and the medical records from that visit indicated that Plaintiff conveyed physical complaints to the\n\nemergency room staff, similar to those he had raised to Dr. Barone. However, none of Dr. Barone's testimony\nconcerned emotional trauma, nor did he testify that Plaintiff conveyed to him that he suffered the physical injuries\nas a result of the strip search.\nRule 50 Motion\nAfter plaintiff rested, defendant moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 50 on the ground that\nPlaintiff had failed to make a prima facie case on either the false arrest claim or the unlawful strip search claim.\nThe Court dismissed the false arrest claim as a matter of law, finding that Trooper Fearon had probable cause\n358 under New York law to arrest Plaintiff for unlawful possession of *358 narcotics and hypodermic needles, under\nthe so-called auto presumption of the New York Penal Law ยง 220.25, which provides:\nThe presence of a controlled substance in an automobile, other than a public omnibus, is\npresumptive evidence of knowing possession thereof by each and every person in the automobile\nat the time such controlled substance was found.\nDefendant's Case\nThe defense put on two witnesses: Trooper George Pearce and Defendant, Trooper Denzil Fearon.\nPearce's Testimony\nTrooper Pearce stopped a vehicle heading eastbound on Route 6 after observing the driver, Reza Kusani,\ncommit 3 traffic infractions. Pearce asked Kusani for his driver's license and registration, and returned to his\npatrol vehicle to run a check to determine the status of both the driver and the vehicle. Trooper Pearce received a\ntransmission back from his base, Brewster Barracks, that Kusani's license had been revoked. Trooper Pearce\nthereupon radioed Brewster Barracks to send a second trooper as backup, as the car contained two occupants\nand Pearce expected that the vehicle might have to be impounded, searched and inventoried.\nTrooper Pearce then approached the driver's side of the vehicle and asked the driver to step out of the vehicle.\nAfter further inquiry, Trooper Pearce discovered that Kusani's license had been revoked. He arrested Kusani for\nAggravated Unlicensed Operation of a Vehicle in the third degree. He conducted a patdown of Kusani's clothing,\nhandcuffed him, and escorted him to his trooper vehicle. After Trooper Fearon arrived as back-up, Trooper\nPearce conducted an inventory search of the car. He found narcotics and hypodermic needles in the trunk.\nWhen Pearce asked Kusani about the drugs and needles, Kusani professed to know nothing about them. On\ncross-examination, Pearce elaborated:\nQ. Did you ask [Kusani about the items found]?\nA. Yes, I did.\nQ. And what was his answer?\nA. He said he didn't know what I was talking about.\nQ. So, he neither admitted it or denied it was his?\nA. I asked him if he had any knowledge of the needles and the pills that were found in the fanny\npack, in the trunk of the vehicle, and he said, \"I do not know what you're talking about.\"\nQ. And that was shown to him?\nA. Eventually, yes, it was.\nQ. And he still maintained, \"I don't know what you're talking about?\"\n\nA. Until we got him back to the station, yes.\nQ. And was he, in your mind, denying those items existed?\nA. Yes. (Tr. at 180-181.)\nPearce told Trooper Fearon that Kusani had denied knowledge of the drugs. Pearce further testified that it was\npolice procedure that \"if neither one or any of the occupants are taking responsibility [for items found in the car],\nit's presumed that they all knew about it, and that they are jointly in possession.\" (Tr. 183.)\nThis was a matter of some importance since, according to Pearce, if Kusani had admitted at the scene that the\n359 drugs were his, Plaintiff would have been released immediately.[1] There was a direct conflict *359 between\nPearce 00 who stated that Kusani denied responsibility for the drugs until he arrives at the Barracks 00 and Kusani\n97 97\n00who claimed that he absolved Plaintiff at the scene of the stop. This difference, as will be seen, is critical.\n97\nPearce testified that, after he learned that the drugs were Kusani's, he informed Fearon, who had Plaintiff in\ncustody at the Barracks.\nFearon's Testimony\nTrooper Fearon testified that Pearce showed him the drugs and needles and said that Kusani had denied\nownership of the drugs. Fearon then asked Plaintiff about the items. Plaintiff denied that the drugs and needles\nbelonged to him. Fearon placed Plaintiff under arrest. He then took Plaintiff to the Brewster Barracks, where he\nstrip searched Plaintiff.\nFearon testified that it was not police policy to strip search all suspects. He testified that Mr. Kelleher was strip\nsearched because he was under arrest for criminal possession of a controlled substance and \"we had to make\nsure that he didn't have any further controlled substances on his person.\" (Tr. 211.)\nFearon denied that he touched Plaintiff during the strip search, in direct contradiction to Plaintiff's testimony. He\ntestified that he wore surgical gloves during the entire exam, even while he searched Plaintiff's clothing. When\nasked why he wore the gloves, Fearon testified:\nA. The reason gloves are worn, is to keep anything that he might have at this body, blood, any sort\nof contaminant, so it wouldn't get on me. Also, I mean, if I might have a cut or contaminant on my\nfinger, I don't it to get on him, on his clothing. (Tr. 214.)\nThis contradicted Mr. Kelleher's testimony that Fearon wore the gloves only after he had searched through\nKelleher's clothes.\nPearce testified that Kusani informed him that the drugs were his after they were back at the Barracks. Troopers\nPearce and Fearon both testified that Pearce then informed Trooper Fearon 00 after he emerged from the\n97\nbathroom with Mr. Kelleher 00 that Kusani had taken responsibility for possession of the drugs and needles and\n97\nthat Mr. Kelleher could be released. Plaintiff's testimony that Fearon told him he was free to go while they were\nstill in the bathroom contradicted Fearon's and Pearce's testimony.\nFearon confirmed Pearce's statement that Plaintiff never would have been arrested or searched if Kusani had\ntaken responsibility for the drugs at the scene. Thus, on direct examination, Trooper Fearon testified as follows:\nQ. Trooper Fearon, had Mr. Kusani admitted at the roadside that the drugs and the needles were\nhis, would Mr. Kelleher have been arrested for this crime?\nA. No. (Tr. 217.)\nAnd on cross-examination, Trooper Fearon was asked:\n\nQ. Let's suppose someone 00 there are two people in the car. Contraband is found. One says \"It's\n97\nmine,\" and based on that statement, you accept that as being true?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Okay. (Tr. 234.)\n360 *360 He further testified that \"if Mr. Kusani had claimed ownership when he was initially asked, then\n[2]\nMr. Kelleher would have been able to leave.\" (Tr. 297.)\nJury Charge\nBecause the Court dismissed the unlawful arrest claim as a matter of law at the close of Plaintiff's case, the only\nclaim left for the jury was whether Plaintiff was strip searched, pursuant to a lawful arrest, in violation of his\nconstitutional right to be free from unreasonable search. The jury was instructed on the New York law governing\nunlawful possession of hypodermic needles and unlawful possession of controlled substances and the law\nconcerning the circumstances under which a strip search may be conducted incident to a lawful arrest. They\nwere further instructed on qualified immunity and proximate cause. (Tr. 327-338.)\nThe jury returned a verdict for the Plaintiff and awarded him $125,000 in compensatory damages.\nMotion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\nDefendant moves here under Rule 50(b) for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial or\nremittitur. Rule 50(b) allows the Court to enter a judgment notwithstanding the jury's verdict whenever the law so\nrequires. \"Judgment as a matter of law may not properly be granted under Rule 50 unless the evidence, viewed\nin the light most favorable to the opposing party, is insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find in her favor.\" \nGaldieri-Ambrosini v. National Realty & Develop. Corp, 136 F.3d 276, 289, (2d Cir.1998). Thus, in deciding such a\nmotion, the court must give deference to all credibility determinations and reasonable inferences of the jury. The\ncourt may not itself weigh the credibility of witnesses or consider the weight of the evidence. See, id. \"JMOL\nshould not be granted unless (1) there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the\njury's findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture, or (2) there is such an\noverwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded [persons] could not\narrive at a verdict against [it].\" Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., 148 F.3d 149, 161 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing Cruz v. Local\nUnion No. 3 of the Int'l B'hood of Electrical Workers, 34 F.3d 1148, 1154 (2d Cir.1994)).\nDefendant is not Entitled to Qualified Immunity\nSince Defendant admitted strip searching Plaintiff, the only issue was whether Trooper Fearon was entitled to\n361 qualified immunity. The jury specifically found that Trooper Fearon was not entitled to qualified *361 immunity.\nDefendant argues here that he was entitled to qualified immunity and, as a matter of law, that the judgment\nagainst him should therefore be vacated.\nWhere the plaintiff alleges the violation of a clearly established right 00 as was the case here 00 qualified immunity\n97 97\nprotects a police officer from civil liability for violating a plaintiff's constitutional rights only if \"`a reasonable officer\ncould have believed' his action to be lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information he possessed.\" \nWeyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, 857 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534,\n116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991)) (emphasis added). Trooper Fearon would have been entitled to qualified immunity if, at\nthe time of the challenged action, it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his behavior did not violate\nthe plaintiff's clearly established rights. Lennon v. Miller, 66 F.3d 416, 418 (2d Cir.1995) (citing Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)). The test is objective; the Trooper's\n\nsubjective belief is irrelevant. See Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998). \nSee also, Simms v. Village of Albion, 115 F.3d 1098, 1108 (2d Cir.1997).\nPlaintiff had a right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. A strip search is permitted as a reasonable\nmethod of discovering evidence of a crime and deterring the smuggling of contraband into prison facilities. Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 588, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979). Detainees who are lawfully incarcerated may be required to\nexpose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search where an objectively reasonable\nsuspicion exists that they are carrying contraband, weapons, means of escape or evidence of a crime. Id. at 588,\n99 S.Ct. 1861 (emphasis added). Whether an objectively reasonable suspicion exists arises from the nature of\nthe charge and the circumstances of the arrest. In accordance with the guidance from the Supreme Court, the\nNew York State Trooper manual states:\nDo not conduct a strip search or body cavity search without reasonable suspicion that the prisoner\nmay be concealing weapons or contraband. Reasonable suspicion may be based on the nature of\nthe charge, such as weapons or narcotics violations or assault, the nature and conduct of the\narrestee, or the particular circumstances of the arrest.\nNew York State Police Policy, ยง 31 E(2).\nIt is well established that it is within the province of the jury to decide factual issues with respect to the defense of\nqualified immunity. See Kim v. Hurston, 182 F.3d 113 (2d Cir.1999). The existence of reasonable suspicion\njustifying a strip search is a factual issue to be decided by the jury. See Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st\nCir.1997).\nThe evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the finding that Trooper Fearon had no objectively\nreasonable suspicion to strip search Plaintiff, even though Trooper Fearon had probable cause to arrest Plaintiff\nfor possession of narcotics based on the automobile presumption. Kusani testified that he told Trooper Pearce\nthat the needles and pills belonged to him at the time of the stop, before either he or Mr. Kelleher were placed in\nthe patrol cars and taken to Brewster Barracks. Trooper Pearce testified that Kusani did not claim possession of\nthe drugs until after he was brought back to the barracks. Ordinarily, this discrepancy would be of little moment.\nBut in this case, it assumes critical proportions. Why? Because both troopers testified that it is standard police\npractice that, where one occupant of an automobile claims ownership of drugs found in a common area of the\ncar, all other persons found in the car who deny ownership of the drugs are free to leave immediately, New York's\ncar presumption notwithstanding. This testimony may seem incredible to anyone with experience in law\n362 enforcement, but that does not include the jurors. And if the jurors *362 chose to believe Kusani's account of their\nconversation over Pearce's, they could infer that Plaintiff should have been allowed to leave the scene without\neven going to the Barracks 00 and without being strip searched.\n97\nIf Fearon and Pearce had never spoken at the scene, there would have been no evidence from which the jury\ncould have inferred that Fearon knew that Kusani had claimed responsibility for the drugs. If they had not spoken,\nFearon would have been entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law on the basis that Kelleher was under\narrest for possession or narcotics, a charge under which New York State Police Policy authorizes strip searches.\nHowever, the jury had a basis for inferring that Fearon knew what Pearce knew and conducted the strip search\nanyway. The evidence showed that the two officers met and spoke at the rear of Kusani's car after Pearce\nconfronted Kusani with the items from the trunk and after Kusani confessed to owning the drugs (relying on the\nversion the jury must have believed). The troopers testified that this was when Pearce told Fearon that the drugs\nwere not his, but since the jury necessarily adopted Kusani's version of the Pearce/Kusani conversation, they\nmust have rejected this testimony. Following the Troopers' conversation, Defendant took Kelleher to the Barracks\nand strip searched him. Viewing the evidence most favorably to the Plaintiff, immediately after the search, Fearon\ntold Kelleher to get dressed and go, without ever having another conversation with Pearce. Since it was not\nnecessary for Kelleher to have drugs on his persons for Pearce to hold plaintiff for criminal possession of a\ncontrolled substance, the only logical inference is that Fearon was told, before the strip search, that Kusani had\nalready confessed to owning the drugs and had therefore (in the troopers' interpretation of the law) overcome the\nautomobile presumption. Otherwise, he would have no basis to \"unarrest\" Kelleher (Trooper Pearce's evocative\nword) immediately upon the conclusion of the strip search.\n\nDefendant argues that, even if the jury believed Kusani's testimony that he admitted ownership of the drugs and\nneedles, Trooper Fearon's decision to conduct a strip search of the Plaintiff was still objectively reasonable as a\nmatter of law. Defendant's argument rests on the fact that Plaintiff was found in a vehicle in which controlled\nsubstance and hypodermic needles were discovered. The contraband was found in the trunk of the car, not in the\npersonal possession of either the Plaintiff or the driver of the car. Defendant contends that these facts, together\nwith the automobile presumption, give rise to an objectively reasonable suspicion that Plaintiff carried\ncontraband, and thus justified the strip search. Further, Defendant notes that even if Trooper Fearon subjectively\nbelieved that Plaintiff was not carrying contraband, the strip search would be justified.\nDefendant is correct that the test for an objectively reasonable suspicion looks to what a reasonably objective\nofficer would do under the same circumstances. However, it is for this very reason that the jury's findings of fact\non the question of immunity must be upheld is this case. The only evidence before the jury of what a reasonably\nobjective officer would have done in the circumstances of this case was the Troopers' testimony that, given the\nfacts posited by the Plaintiff's witnesses, Kelleher should never even have been taken back to the barracks, let\nalone strip searched. This removes any rationale for conducting a strip search.\nI therefore find as a matter of law that Defendant was not entitled to qualified immunity.\nMotion for New Trial or Remittitur\nDefendant argues that, even if he was not entitled to qualified immunity, the jury award was excessive, and he\n363 moves for a new trial or remittitur of the jury award. A district court may grant a *363 new trial if the jury has\nreached a seriously erroneous result or if the jury's verdict is a miscarriage of justice. See Sorlucco v. New York\nCity Police Dep't, 971 F.2d 864, 875 (2d Cir.1992). For the purposes of determining whether a new trial is\nappropriate, the court may weigh the evidence on its own, and need not view it in a light most favorable to the\nnon-movant. See Song v. Ives Laboratories Inc., 957 F.2d 1041, 1047 (2d Cir.1992). A new trial may be ordered\neven where there is substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict, see id., and a new trial may be ordered on\nall or only some of the issues at the first trial.\nRemittitur is the \"process by which a court compels a plaintiff to choose between reduction of an excessive\nverdict and a new trial.\" Earl v. Bouchard Transp. Co., 917 F.2d 1320, 1328 (2d Cir. 1990). Remittitur is proper\nwhere \"the award is so high as to shock the judicial conscience and constitute a denial of justice.\" Ismail v.\nCohen, 899 F.2d 183, 186 (2d Cir.1990). The doctrine of remittitur recognizes that, although it is within the jury's\ndiscretion to compute damages, there is an upper limit, and whether that has been surpassed is a question of\nlaw, not fact. Mazyck v. Long Island R. Co., 896 F.Supp. 1330, 1336 (E.D.N.Y.1995) (citing Dagnello v. Long\nIsland R.R. Co., 289 F.2d 797, 806 (2d Cir.1961)). A jury \"may not abandon analysis for sympathy for a suffering\nplaintiff and treat and injury as though it were a winning lottery ticket.\" Scala v. Moore McCormack Lines, Inc.,\n985 F.2d 680, 684 (2d Cir. 1993). Here, even if the jury found that Plaintiff's rights had been violated as a result of\nthe strip search, a new trial or remittitur might be appropriate if this Court deems the damages award excessive.\nThe jury here made an award to Plaintiff in the amount of $125,000 for compensatory damages for his emotional\ndistress. At no point in the trial did Plaintiff produce any evidence of medical treatment or other professional\nexpenses related to his claim of emotional distress. In fact, the only evidence of medical treatment was the\ntestimony of his chiropractor, which was limited to the physical injuries Plaintiff alleged he sustained as a result of\nthe handcuffing 00 not the result of the strip search. At no point did Plaintiff put on any evidence 00 save his own\n97 97\ntestimony 00 to corroborate his concluding statement that the headaches, sleeplessness and the general\n97\nemotional distress he claimed to have suffered resulted from the strip search.\nIn Annis v. County of Westchester, 136 F.3d 239 (2d Cir.1998), the Second Circuit described the evidence\nnecessary to establish damages for emotional distress, and held that where a plaintiff does not allege any\nphysical manifestations of an emotional injury, fails to introduce evidence to corroborate a claim that he needs or\nhas had counseling, and does not suffer and job detriment, compensatory damages are inappropriate. Id. at 239.\nIn Annis, a female former police officer sued under Section 1983 alleging sex discrimination during her\nemployment with the Mount Vernon and Westchester county police departments. The jury awarded Anis\n\n$541,001 in compensatory and punitive damages. The district court denied defendant's motion for judgment as a\nmatter of law, but granted defendant's the motion for remittitur or a new trial, reducing the damage award to\n$225,001. The Second Circuit vacated and remanded the entire award on the basis that the jury had no grounds, \ninter alia, that the plaintiff presented no evidence 00 apart from her own testimony 00 to support her claim of\n97 97\nemotional distress.\nThe facts here are similar to those in Annis. Mr. Kelleher has alleged, but has provided no proof 00 beyond his\n97\nown testimony 00 to support his claim for damages. Notwithstanding the Defendant's liability, Mr. Kelleher has\n97\nsimply failed to prove an injury.\n364 This does not mean that I must throw out the damage award altogether. *364 In determining whether a jury award\nis excessive a court may consider jury awards in similar cases. See Martell v. Boardwalk Enterprises, Inc., 748\nF.2d 740, 752-53 (2d Cir.1984). Defendant argues that the verdict of $125,000 is excessive and wholly\ninconsistent with the compensatory damages awarded in similar cases involving strip searches. See, e.g., \nKennedy v. Los Angeles Police Department, 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir.1989) (awarding $5,000 against each of the\noffending officers); Abshire v. Walls, 830 F.2d 1277 (4th Cir.1987) (awarding $500 and $1,000 in compensatory\ndamages against each defendant involved in strip search); Joan W. v. City of Chicago, 771 F.2d 1020 (7th\nCir.1985) (ordering remittitur from $112,000 to $75,000 where plaintiff suffered emotional distress plus\naggravating circumstances such as the officers threatening plaintiff, using vulgar language, and laughing at her;\nnoting that jury awards in 8 other unlawful strip search cases in the Northern District of Illinois ranged from\n$3,300 to $60,000).\nThe award of $125,000 is clearly excessive given the lack of corroborating medical testimony concerning\nPlaintiff's emotional distress. However, an unlawful strip search, in and of itself, is an egregious violation of\nPlaintiff's constitutional right to be free from unwarranted government intrusion of his person. Moreover, Plaintiff\ntestified that he was touched during the search by Trooper Fearon, which is contrary to State Police policy for\nconducting a strip search. I therefore cannot find that Plaintiff is entitled to no damages.\nIn light of the above, I order remittitur in the amount of $25,000. If Plaintiff is unwilling to accept that amount, I will\nschedule a new trial on the question of damages.\nThis constitutes the decision and order of this court.\n[1] Pearce testified: \nQ. Okay. Now, when he was arrested, he was arrested for possession of these items, the plaintiff here?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And your statement was, once someone takes a position that it is theirs, you leave the other ones alone?\nA. Yes. They are unarrested. They are released, the charges.\nQ. What about at the scene? Let's say the same situation, Mr. Kusani says \"They're mine.\" Would you at that\ntime let him go, [Mr. Kelleher] go home?\nA. Yes. [objection made after answer and overruled]\nQ. Okay. So the question now is whether Mr. Kusani said, \"They're mine,\" at the scene, is that correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So if he said it, then the plaintiff would be allowed to go home?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So it is your position he never said, \"It was mine\"; is that correct?\nA. Not at the scene, no. (Tr. 184-185.)\n\n[2] Fearon testified: \nQ. Did you hear [Trooper Pearce] state that the purpose of determining ownership was to find out who the owner\nwas and so that the other person would be allowed to leave?\nA. When conducting an investigation, we have to determine who owns the items. If in 00 if in the case which\n97\nhappened in this case, if neither person claims ownership, then under the law both subjects are presumed to\npossess the items, in this case, the drugs.\n...\nQ. Related to this case 00 if Mr. Kusani claimed ownership, would Mr. Keller be allowed to go home or leave?\n97\nA. That depends on what time Mr. Kusani claimed ownership.\nQ. Why is the time important?\nA. It's very important. If Mr. Kusani had claimed ownership when he was initially asked, then Mr. Kelleher would\nhave been able to leave.\nQ. So, if Mr. Kusani at the scene said, \"I'm the owner,\" then there would be no need for a strip search; would that\nbe correct?\nA. Which he didn't.\nCOURT: Just answer the question that you are asked trooper.\nQ. Please, please. All I'm asking you, if at the scene Mr. Kusani stated, \"I am the owner,\" then, a that point, Mr.\nKelleher would be allowed to go home?\nA. Yes. (Tr. 297.)
