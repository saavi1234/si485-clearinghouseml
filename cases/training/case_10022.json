Keach, Esq., for plaintiffs; Frank Gaglione, Esq., James Domagalski, Esq., Thomas D'Agostino, Esq., Assistant County Attorney Kristin Klein Wheaton, for defendants.Status Conference held on 8/3/2005. Parties discussed status of discovery relative to class certification motion and plaintiffs' desire to extend deadline for class certification as well as their intention to move to compel disclosure. Schedule for defendants' pending motion to compel 16 was also discussed. Plaintiffs stated that claims remain against defendant Gallivan in his individual capacity. Plaintiffs complained about the conduct of depositions, and defendants complained about ex parte communication by plaintiffs' investigator with Erie County Sheriff's deputies (an investigator who was serving subpoenaes upon the deputies). Plaintiffs finally complained that they have not received correspondence sent by defense counsel to the Court. Defendants finally mentioned scheduling issues in the ongoing depositions of defendants' staff.The Court admonished counsel to make motions to seek redress raised in this conference and in correspondence leading to this conference. Any such motions are due by 8/10/2005. The Court then will issue a scheduling Order for briefing of those motions, including a schedule for defendants' motion to compel 16 . The class certification motion deadline remains as schedule absent an motion or stipulation requesting a change.All counsel for the parties who have not filed formal notices of appearance (including registration with ECF) must do so in order to receive notices from the Court.

    "summary": "<p>On October 31, 2003, three plaintiffs represented by private attorneys with law firms in New York and Washington, D.C., filed this class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. They alleged that the Erie County Sheriff's Department had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all individuals who entered either the Erie County Holding Center (ECHC) or the Erie County Correctional Facility (ECCF), regardless of the crime charged and without reasonable suspicion that the individuals were concealing weapons or contraband. The plaintiffs alleged that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and class certification.</p>\r\n<p>The parties engaged in contentious discovery, resulting in numerous discovery motions and request for sanctions. District Judge John T. Curtin and Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott made numerous unpublished rulings on these issues. See, e.g., 2006 WL 1455484; 2006 WL 2927852 (order relating to the deposition of an Assistant County Attorney). Additionally, the judges issued opinions regarding discovery of e-mails sent by a former Assistant County Attorney to individual defendants and other Sheriff's Department officials regarding the Sheriff's Department's evolving policies regarding inmate strip searches. See, e.g., 2006 WL 3858475; objections overruled by 2006 WL 3872844; vacated and remanded by 473 F.3d 413. On remand, the district court found that dissemination of attorney's advice did not waive attorney-client privilege. 2007 WL 1703832. On reconsideration, the court found that the defendants waived the attorney-client privilege with respect to the disputed e-mails by placing the information in those communications \"at issue\" in the litigation. 2007 WL 3232096.</p>\r\n<p>In September of 2009, the plaintiffs sought class certification of the class of &ldquo;all persons who have been placed into the custody of the Erie County Correctional Facility and/or the Erie County Holding Center after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry into the Erie County Correctional Facility and/or the Erie County Holding Center pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Erie County Sheriff's Department and the County of Erie.&rdquo; The plaintiffs requested that the court certify this action as a money damages class action under Rule 23(b)(3). In the alternative, the plaintiffs sought issue certification under Rule 23(c)(4). The court, finding that ECHC and ECCF had different procedures in place, certified two separate classes&ndash;&ndash;one for each facility. 269 F.R.D. 213, 219.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, in 2012, the Supreme Court decided <em>Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders</em>, 566 U.S. 318, and held that suspicionless strip searches, regardless of the crime charged, did not violate the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments. In response, the plaintiffs in this case submitted a brief distinguishing this case from Florence. The plaintiffs argued that the strip searches in Florence were private, individual searches, while the searches in this case were in groups. (In ECHC, class members were searched in groups of three in a shower area, and in ECCF, class members were searched in larger groups in a large common room.) The plaintiffs further argued that the Florence decision was limited to the facts addressed in that case.</p>\r\n<p>The court instructed the parties to provide a joint submission regarding the procedural posture of this action based on <em>Florence</em>, but the parties did not reach an agreement. Instead, on May 23, 2012, the plaintiffs requested that the court allow the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>After a change of attorneys in 2016 and inaction on the part of the plaintiffs, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on August 25, 2017. The plaintiffs requested a stay of briefing on the motion for summary judgment pending the plaintiff&rsquo;s filing of a motion for voluntary discontinuance of the action and decertification of the class. The plaintiffs acknowledged that in light of <em>Florence</em>, their claims were no longer viable as a federal issue and instead asserted their intent to renew the issue under New York State law in the New York Court of Appeals.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants objected to the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for voluntary discontinuance and urged the court to decide the issue on the merits They argued that the plaintiffs had ample opportunity during the thirteen years of litigation, and particularly in the five years post-<em>Florence</em> before the defendants filed for summary judgment, to amend their complaint to include issues of state law&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In February 2018, the court granted the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion to decertify the class but denied their motions for voluntary discontinuance and to amend. 2018 WL 1036165. The court granted defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment against two of the three named plaintiffs. Judgment sought against the third named plaintiff and any member of the now-decertified class was denied as moot.</p>",

The plaintiffs alleged that the Erie County Sheriff's Department had an unconstitutional policy and practice of strip-searching prisoners when they entered the county facilities. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar strip search policy was constitutional in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders. The plaintiffs in this case argued that their case was distinguishable from Florence but never filed an amended complaint. After years of taking no action, the defendants filed for summary judgment based on the holding of Florence, and the court denied the plaintiffs’ request for voluntary dismissal because their years of inaction was prejudicial to the defendants.",

Hugh B. Scott \n                                                  Plaintiffs,\n04CV534C\nOrder\nv.    \nTHE COUNTY OF ERIE, et al.,\n                                                  Defendants.\nBefore the Court is a continuation of the various discovery and other pretrial motions\nrecently decided.  Here, the Court ordered all parties to submit applications to recover their\nrespective reasonable motion costs (including attorneys’ fees) relative to their discovery motions\n(see Docket No. 52, Order).  Familiarity with that Order is presumed.  The parties then entered\ninto a Stipulation (Docket No. 55) and seek an Order confirming their agreement not to move for\ncosts for their respective motions.\nBACKGROUND\nPrevailing Parties on the Discovery Motions--Defendants\nThe County Defendants1 sought from plaintiffs initial disclosures and responses to their\ndocument demands and interrogatories (Docket No. 16), seeking costs (Docket No. 17, County\n1Former Sheriff Gallivan, current Sheriff Howard, Sheriff’s Department officials Huggins\nand Livingston, and the County of Erie.\n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 56   Filed 10/11/05   Page 2 of 8\nDefs.’ Atty. Aff. at 12).  This Court granted that motion where plaintiffs have not produced\n(Docket No. 52, Order, at 7-10).  The Court awarded them their reasonable motion expenses (id.\nat 10-12, 14-15, 35).\nDefendant Gipson also moved for document production from plaintiffs as well as answers\nto his interrogatories (Docket No. 22), also seeking motion costs (Docket No. 23, Def. Atty. Aff.\nat 5).  This Court noted that Gipson made no effort to show his good faith effort to resolve this\nissue short of motion practice and, while granting production where it had not been performed,\ndenied Gipson fees (Docket No. 52, Order, at 10-12).  But Gipson later joined in the County\nDefendants’ motion regarding initial disclosures.  All defendants sought evidentiary preclusion as\na sanction for plaintiffs’ failure to furnish initial disclosures, but this Court denied that extreme\nform of relief, granting instead the limited relief of awarding motion costs as to plaintiffs’ initial\ndisclosure (Docket No. 52, Order, at 13-15).\nThe Court denied in part, granted in part, the County Defendants’ motion for a protective\nOrder against plaintiffs’ ex parte communication with Sheriff’s Department employees (Docket\nNo. 40), allowing plaintiffs to contact ex parte rank and file Sheriff’s deputies and employees but\nnot officers ranked at sergeant and above (Docket No. 52, Order at 32-33, 34).  The Court then\ndetermined that each party should bear their own motion costs for this motion (id. at 34).\nPrevailing Parties on Discovery Motions--Plaintiffs\nPlaintiffs filed an omnibus motion, seeking (among other relief) compelled production of\nseveral forms of discovery from defendants (Docket No. 25), seeking relief the Court deemed\njust, proper and equitable (id. at 2).  This Court granted plaintiffs limited production of the\nbooking sheets and in camera inspection of the privilege log documents (Docket No. 52, Order at\n2\n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 56   Filed 10/11/05   Page 3 of 8\n16-18, 21-23, 36), while denying their motion for interrogatory answers regarding a former cross-\nclaim against Gipson and a protective order on the conduct of depositions (id. at 18-21, 36).  The\nCourt determined that plaintiffs prevailed over one-third of the discovery motions they made,\nhence they should recover one-third of the costs for the motion or the actual costs of the portions\nof the omnibus motion in which they prevailed (id. at 22-23).  Similarly, the County Defendants\n(and not Gipson, see id. at 23 n.7) should prevail on one-third of their motion costs in responding\nto the unsuccessful discovery portions of plaintiffs’ omnibus motion (id. at 23).\nSeptember 26 Order and Briefing Schedule\nThe Order granting (and denying) these discovery motions set forth a schedule for parties\nto submit their respective motion expense application affidavits within five (5) business days of\nthe entry of that Order (Docket No. 52, Order at 12, 36, see id. at 15), or by October 3, 2005. \nResponses (without replies) were due five (5) business days from service of these affidavits (or\nas late as Tuesday, October 11, 2005), and the applications were deemed submitted as of this\nlatter date.  The Order also states that counsel, and not their clients, are to be responsible for the\nmotion expense awards made herein (Docket No. 52, Order at 34-35, 36).  \nBut on September 30, 2005, the parties entered into a stipulation agreeing that all parties\nwould bear their own respective costs for their motions and not move for costs under this Court’s\nSeptember 26, 2005, Order (Docket No. 55).  They seek that stipulation confirmed as an Order.\nDISCUSSION\nThe purpose of discovery sanctions under Rule 37 is to enforce full discovery “for the\njust, speedy and inexpensive determination of the lawsuit.”  Robison v. Transamerica Ins. Co.,\n368 F.2d 37, 39 (10th Cir. 1966) (Murrah, J.).  They also provide a general deterrent to parties\n3\n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 56   Filed 10/11/05   Page 4 of 8\nand counsel in other cases as well as remedying the situation in the particular case, see\n8A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§ 2284, at 618 & n.21 (quoting National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc.,\n427 U.S. 639, 643 (1976)), 640 (Civil 2d ed. 1994).  Courts have discretion to impose an\nappropriate sanction order to make “the punishment fit the crime,” see 8A Federal Practice and\nProcedure, supra,§ 2284, at 640, 614.  These sanctions are limited to the reasonable expenses\nincurred in connection with the motion.  7 Moore’s Federal Practice § 37.23[6] (3d ed. 2001). \nThese sanctions, however, are not to create a source for ancillary litigation.  The sanctions within\nRule 37 are mandatory whenever a party is compelled to move to obtain discovery or is forced to\ndefend such a motion and prevails in that defense.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4)(A), (B).  (See Docket\nNo. 52, Order at 11.)  That rule is intended to compensate the party for the cost it incurred in\nseeking discovery, ultimately having to resort to judicial intervention to receive that which\nshould be produced voluntarily.  See J.M Cleminshaw Co. v. City of Norwich, 93 F.R.D. 338,\n350-51, 351-60 (D. Conn. 1981) (Cabranes, D.J.).  In J.M. Cleminshaw Co., the court found that\ncounsel repeatedly failed to respond to plaintiff’s discovery demands and court discovery orders,\nimposing not only plaintiff’s modest motion costs but also a fine paid to the Court as a further\nsanction, id.  There is a rebuttable presumption in favor of imposing an expense shifting sanction\non the party against whom a motion to compel is resolved.  7 Moore’s Federal Practice, supra, §\n37.23[1], at 37-41.  The clients paid for counsel to make the motion to secure this discovery or to\nresist its production.  As prevailing parties, the clients are entitled to this compensation.\nUnder Rule 37(a)(4), the movant is entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.  “If\nthe court determines to award expenses and fees, it is for the court to decide what amount is\n4\n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 56   Filed 10/11/05   Page 5 of 8\nproper.”  8A Federal Practice and Procedure, supra,§ 2288, at 666-67; see also Addington v.\nMid-American Lines, 77 F.R.D. 750, 751 (W.D. Mo. 1978).\nIn this case, rather than precluding evidence as defendants wished (see Docket No. 52,\nOrder, at 12-15), the Court ordered as sanction that plaintiffs pay defendants’ motion costs (id. at\n14-15).  Non-compliant parties were also sanctioned for the reasonable motion costs (id. at 22-\n23).  The Court also imposed the sanction solely upon plaintiffs and defense counsel, and not\ntheir respective clients (id. at 34-35).  See 8A Federal Practice and Procedure, supra, § 2284, at\n639 & n.51.  The Court enjoys broad discretion to issue orders as are just under Rule 37.  Id. at\n614.\nAt issue here is whether the very counsel who would be required to pay costs to the\nopposing party can stipulate to agree to not move for those sanctions (or to waive those costs\npreviously sought).  While an attorney may “exercise professional judgment to waive or fail to\nassert a right or position of the client,” DR 7-101(B)(1)2; 22 N.Y.C.R.R. § 1200.32(b)(1), or even\nacceding to reasonable requests of opposing counsel “which do not prejudice the rights of the\nclients,” DR 7-101(A)(1); 22 N.Y.C.R.R. § 1200.32(a)(1),  such a waiver should not occur where\nthe attorneys have a vested interest in the right being waived.  “After accepting employment, a\nlawyer carefully should refrain from acquiring a property right or assuming a position that would\ntend to make his or her judgment less protective of the interests of the client.” New York State\nCode of Prof’l Resp. EC 5-2; see also id. EC 5-7 (lawyer generally should not have financial\ninterest in outcome of litigation), 5-1 (the lawyer’s personal interest should not be permitted to\n2See Docket No. 52, Order, at 28-29, accepting New York State Code of Professional\nResponsibility as guidelines.\n5\n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 56   Filed 10/11/05   Page 6 of 8\ndilute the lawyer’s loyalty to the client), Canon 9 (“a lawyer should avoid even the appearance of\nprofessional impropriety”)).  Except for a lien to secure an attorneys’ fee or a contingent fee\narrangement, a lawyer is not to have a proprietary interest in the subject matter of litigation the\nlawyer is conducting for a client, id., DR 5-103(A); 22 N.Y.C.R.R. § 1200.22(a).  “A lawyer\nshall not . . . continue employment if the exercise of professional judgment on behalf of the client\nwill be or reasonably may be affected by the lawyer’s own financial, business, property, or\npersonal interests, unless a disinterested lawyer would believe that the representation of the client\nwill not be adversely affected thereby, and the client consents to the representation after full\ndisclosure of the implications of the lawyer’s interest.”  22 N.Y.C.R.R. § 1200.20(a); see N.Y.S.\nCode of Prof’l Resp. DR 5-101(A).  \nThe counsels’ stipulation to waive imposing fees owed to their opponents (and to their\nown clients) places the lawyers’ individual interests (pecuniary liability) in conflict with their\nrespective clients’ interests (in recovering the costs of prosecuting these discovery motions).  See\nalso Calloway v. Marvel Entertainment Group, 854 F.2d 1452, 1475 (2d Cir. 1988) (where\ncounsel represented client in Rule 11 proceeding which cited client and counsel, court held that\nthe Rule 11 proceeding was tainted by the continued representation by that counsel). While the\nDisciplinary Rules recognize certain professional courtesies as punctuality and “avoiding\noffensive tactics” as exceptions from the requirement of zealous advocacy for the client, DR 7-\n101(A)(1); 22 N.Y.C.R.R. § 1200.32(a)(1), self-exoneration by mutual agreement is not a\nprofessional courtesy or offensive tactic avoidance that warrants acting contrary to the distinct\ninterests of the client.  There is no indication in the record that the clients were advised of this\npotential conflict by their attorneys entering into this stipulation or that the clients offered\n6\n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 56   Filed 10/11/05   Page 7 of 8\ninformed consent.3  It is not the place for counsel to waive recovery of their clients’ costs merely\nbecause counsel would have to pay them.\nThis conflict is heightened on both sides of this case.  On the plaintiffs’ side, since they\nare seeking class status, this stipulation would have the two or three named plaintiffs agree\n(assuming they were informed and made such an agreement) to waive recovery of their motion\ncosts and attorneys’ fees and yet still purport to represent a class of similarly situated persons\nwhile depriving the potential class of recovery of some of the expenses incident to this action. \nOn the defense side, a fiscally challenged municipality like the County of Erie (which is paying\nmost of the defense costs for the defendant officials as well as its own) cannot readily agree to\nwaive (in effect) reimbursement of its motion expenses incurred by its successful outside counsel\nmerely because that counsel agreed with opposing counsel not to press the issue against each\nother. \nExpense shifting sanctions are the ‘“mildest’ of sanctions authorized by Rule 37,” J.M.\nCleminshaw Co., supra, 93 F.R.D. at 349 (quoting Cine Forty-Second St. Theatre v. Allied\nArtists, 602 F.2d 1062, 1066 (2d Cir. 1979)).  Here, counsel are trying to avoid even this mild\nsanction by stipulating to waive their clients’ expenses.  This cannot be tolerated.  While\nminimizing ancillary motion practice regarding sanctions and entering into stipulations generally\noften are laudable (see Docket No. 52, Order at 21), the Court’s previous Order is clear. \nSanctions are to be imposed and to be imposed upon counsel.  The Court required the parties to\nengage in the exercise of providing their reasonable motion costs and award sanctions not only to\n3Given Erie County’s current fiscal woes, it is unlikely that the county would consent to\nwaive part of its outside counsel costs if paid by opposing counsel.\n7\n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 56   Filed 10/11/05   Page 8 of 8\nmake the respective parties whole (for either failing to produce or requiring material that should\nnot be provided) but also the deterrence this remedy has upon other parties and the bar in general. \nCounsel should not be disqualified, however, because of this stipulation; rather, to avoid the\nconflict, the stipulation should not be given effect.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court declines to enter an Order adopting counsels’\nstipulation (Docket No. 55).  The parties shall submit to the Court their respective motion costs\nby October 21, 2005, and respond to those submissions by October 28, 2005.  Failure to submit\nsuch costs will compel the Court to make its own determination as to the amount of the sanction\nto be imposed.  Following this exchange of applications and responses, the Court will issue an\nOrder setting forth the costs each counsel is responsible for (see Docket No. 52, Order at 36, 34-\n35).\nSo Ordered.\n                       s/HBS                \nHon.

The current scheduling Order in this\ncase had plaintiffs’ expert disclosure due by July 17, 2006; defendants’ expert disclosure due by\nAugust 15, 2006; all expert disclosure to be completed by September 1, 2006; and fact discovery\nto be completed by September 12, 2006 (Docket Nos. 103, 1041).  Dispositive motions then were\ndue on or before December 27, 2006 (id.).  The Orders setting this schedule clearly indicated that\nthe Court would not entertain further extensions of the dates (id.).\nAs the parties are well aware, this case is a potential class action with the motion to\ncertify that class pending (Docket Nos. 131, 133, 139).  Plaintiffs’ counsel noted that the\nremaining fact discovery is dependent upon the decision on the class certification issue.  They\nrequested a thirty-day extension of the fact discovery deadline and extension of the expert\n1Also scheduled is a settlement conference on Wednesday, October 11, 2006, at\n10:15 am, Docket Nos. 138, 139.\n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 141   Filed 08/30/06   Page 2 of 3\ndeadlines (which the parties stipulated to occur after the fact discovery deadline) (LaDuca letter). \nPlaintiffs argue that “the type of experts the parties may require for trial of this case depends\nlargely on the ruling on class certification” (id.).  The Court agrees.\nThe determination of the class certification motion potentially is a two-step process.  A\nReport & Recommendation will be rendered on this motion, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), (B),\nthat any party may file a timely objection to.  Ultimately, the final decision of this motion will be\nrendered by Judge Curtin.  Given the uncertainty when these decisions will be entered, fact\ndiscovery may have to be extended numerous times until these decisions become final in this\nCourt.  To avoid further multiple motions or stipulations to extend time (cf. Docket Nos. 27, 28,\n52, 75, 82, 97, 98, 102, 103, 104, 6 (stipulated extension for Local Civil Rule 23(d) deadline for\nclass certification motion)), the case-in-chief fact discovery deadlines, including those for expert\ndisclosures, and the deadline for dispositive motions will be held in abeyance pending\nresolution of the class certification issue, rather than setting (and potentially resetting) new\ndeadlines as the parties await Court decisions.

This Court issued an\nOrder (Docket No. 52, Sept. 26, 2005, familiarity with which is presumed) granting in part that\nmotion (see Docket No. 52, Order at 17-18).  That Order announced that a Protective Order\nwould be entered regarding dissemination of information from these booking sheets to retain\nconfidentiality, see Marriott v. County of Montgomery, No. 03CV531, Tr. Dec. 18, 2003, at 36-\n37 (N.D.N.Y.) (Peebles, Mag. J.) (see Docket No. 25, Ex. H, hereinafter “Marriott”); McDaniels\nv. County of Schenectady, No. 04CV757, Protective Order, Jan. 11, 2005, at 2-6 (N.D.N.Y.)\n(Treece, Mag. J.) (see Docket No. 25, Ex. K, hereinafter “McDaniels Ex. K”), see also Docket\nNo. 25, Ex. J, McDaniels, supra, Order, Jan. 10, 2005, at 3-5 (Treece, Mag. J.) (hereinafter\n“McDaniels Ex. J”).  (Docket No. 52, Order at 17-18.)  What follows is that protective Order.\n\nDISCUSSION\nErie County and Sheriff’s Department officials Howard, Livingston, and Huggins, and\nformer sheriff Gallivan (hereinafter collectively “County Defendants”)1 objected to production of\nthe booking sheets on privacy grounds (Docket No. 29, County Defs. Memo. at 3-11).  Since the\nparties strenuously disagreed upon production of these booking sheets and could not agree upon a\nconfidentiality agreement to obviate the need for plaintiffs’ motion, the Court decided to enter its\nown protective Order.  The Court was guided by the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of New York and its protective orders in similar cases.  See McDaniels Ex. K; see also\nMarriott.  This Order addresses the concerns raised by the County Defendants (see Docket\nNo. 29, County Defs. Memo. at 3-6, 8-11), especially the privacy issues arising from New York\nCriminal Procedure Law § 160.50.\nI. Method of Production\nDefendants are to produce the bookings sheets with redactions or produced in summary\nform identifying only the name, address, telephone number, date of birth, arresting charge, and\ndate of arrest, see Marriott, supra, Tr. at 36, for those arrestees who were arrested from July 2001\nto present, but excluding those arrested who (a) were ultimately not convicted or (b) were\nconvicted of felony offenses (see Docket No. 29, County Defs. Memo. at 11).  (Docket No. 52, at\n17-18).  (Hereinafter the booking sheets, any summaries of these sheets, and the data therefrom\nwill be referred to collectively as the “booking sheets” despite the manner ultimately provided by\n1Remaining defendant Gipson, at oral argument on September 20, 2005, joined in the\narguments of co-defendants.  Since the booking sheets are presumed to be under the control of\nthe Sheriff, production will be assumed to be from the County Defendants.\n2\n\ndefendants.)  Defendants are to explain any coding or shorthand in booking sheets produced so\nthat plaintiffs, and ultimately the Court, can decipher what has been produced.\nII. Confidentiality and Its Preservation\nInformation contained in the booking sheets shall be deemed confidential and subject to\nthis protective Order.  See McDaniels Ex. K, supra.  Access to the data contained in the booking\nsheets shall be limited to counsel and those working directly with counsel on this case. \nPlaintiffs’ counsel shall maintain a list of those to whom this data has been disclosed, with this\nlist available to the Court upon request of any person   See Marriott, supra, Tr. at 37.  Any person\nto whom information provided under this Order is disclosed must sign a statement agreeing to be\nbound by this protective Order.  The signed statement, as annexed hereto as Exhibit A, shall\ncontain a recital that the signatory has read and understands this Order, and that the signatory\nunderstands that unauthorized disclosures of the stamped “CONFIDENTIAL” documents (or\ninformation therefrom) constitutes contempt of court.  See McDaniels, Ex. K, supra, at 4, Ex. A. \nAnyone who is permitted access to stamped “CONFIDENTIAL” booking sheets pursuant to this\nOrder shall use the information only for preparation and the trial (itself) of this litigation and\nshall not use such information for any other purpose.  Id. at 6.\nPrior to defendants’ actual disclosure to plaintiffs of the booking sheets and information\ncontained therein, these documents shall be marked “CONFIDENTIAL” in a manner that will\nnot interfere with their legibility.  Except with the prior written consent of the individual\narrestee(s), individual stamped “CONFIDENTIAL” booking sheets may not be disclosed to any\nperson (including the named plaintiffs) except for the attorneys for the parties and those\nemployees and agents working directly with the attorneys, for use only in connection with this\n3\n\naction.  Should an arrestee become a plaintiff to this action or is interviewed by either party, that\narrestee may be shown his or her personal booking sheet or booking information derived from\nthat sheet only.  McDaniels Ex. K, supra, at 3-4.\nTo the extent that these booking sheets may be used at any one witness or party’s\ndeposition as it may relate to this litigation, said booking sheets remains subject to this protective\nOrder.  Counsel must, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of any deposition transcript, designate\npages of the transcript and/or exhibits thereto as confidential if related to disclosure of the\nbooking sheets; until the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period, the entire deposition will be\ntreated as subject to this protective Order.  If counsel do not timely designate the confidential\ninformation in a deposition relating to a booking sheet, then the entire transcripts and its exhibits\nwill be treated as confidential until such time this Court may lift the protection provided by this\nOrder.  Parties, however, need not re-designate as confidential a document previously so\ndesignated.  Id. at 4-5.\nThe booking sheets that have been marked as “CONFIDENTIAL” pursuant to this Order\nshall continue to be treated as confidential information at trial.  The trial court may determine\nhow this information and/or documents shall be kept confidential at trial.  Id. at 5.\nThe stamped “CONFIDENTIAL” booking sheets, or corresponding pages of deposition\ndeemed confidential, shall not be filed with the Clerk, or submitted for filing by electronic case\nfiling system, except when required in connection with motions under Rule 56 or other matters\npending before the Court.  If required to be filed, said documents shall be filed under seal and\nshall remained sealed so long as they retain their status as stamped “CONFIDENTIAL”\ndocuments.  Id.\n4\n\nNothing in this Order shall prevent or otherwise restrict counsel from rendering advice to\ntheir actual client(s), in the course thereof, relying generally on examination of stamped\n“CONFIDENTIAL” booking sheets, provided, however, that in rendering such advice and\notherwise communicating with such client(s), counsel shall not make specific disclosure of any\nitem so designated, except to have the client adhere to the procedures set forth above.  Id. at 6.\nIII. Duration of Order\nThe provisions of this Order shall not terminate at the conclusion of this action.  Within\nthirty (30) days after final conclusion of all aspects of this litigation, which may include an\nappeal, stamped “CONFIDENTIAL” booking sheets and all copies of the same (other than\nunsealed exhibits of record) shall be returned to defendants or, at the option of defendants,\ndestroyed.  All counsel of record shall make certification of compliance herewith and shall\ndeliver the same to counsel for the County Defendants not more than sixty (60) days after final\ntermination of this litigation.  Id. at 9.\nAll attorneys of record are responsible for employing reasonable measures to control,\nconsistent with this Order, duplication of, access to, and distribution of copies of stamped\n“CONFIDENTIAL” documents.  Id.\nSo Ordered.\n                       s/HBS                \nHon. Hugh B. Scott\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nDated: Buffalo, New York\nSeptember 26, 2005\nATTACHED: Sworn Statement\n5",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nADAM PRITCHARD, \nEDWARD ROBINSON, \nJULENNE TUCKER, \nboth individually and on behalf of a class of \nothers similarly situated, Hon. Hugh B. Scott \n                                                  Plaintiffs,\n04CV534C\nOrder\nv.    \nTHE COUNTY OF ERIE, et al.,\n                                                  Defendants.\nBefore the Court is plaintiffs’ latest motion to compel, namely the continued deposition\nof certain County Defendants’1 witnesses and of defendant H. McCarthy Gipson2, as well as the\ndeposition of two new County Defendants’ witnesses and the costs for their continued\nexaminations (Docket No. 86).  Plaintiffs subsequently moved for extensions of time to complete\nclass certification discovery, case-in-chief discovery, and the motion return date for the class\ncertification motion (Docket Nos. 97, 983).\n1As previously described in other Order, former Sheriff Gallivan, current Sheriff Howard,\nSheriff’s Department officials Huggins and Livingston, and the County of Erie. \n2Defendant Gipson (and not “Gibson” as plaintiffs repeatedly refer to him as, cf. Docket\nNo. 86) was an administrator in the Sheriff’s Department, separately represented in this action;\nhe is now the City of Buffalo’s Police Commissioner.\n3Filed due to ECF error with earlier motion.\n\nBACKGROUND\nThis is an action alleging that Erie County and its Sheriff’s Department conducted\nunconstitutional strip searches of non-felony detainees, including plaintiffs, without reasonable\ncause.  Plaintiffs are three individuals who allegedly were so searched in 2003 and 2004, and\nnow claim that they represent a class of similarly situated persons who were illegally searched\nfrom July 2001 to the present.\nMotion to Compel\nPresently, plaintiffs move to compel either continued examinations or to allow new\nexaminations of Sheriff’s Department personnel, essentially as follow up to document demands\n(including privileged documents, see Docket Nos. 78, 79, 80, 84) (Docket No. 86, Pls. Atty.\nAffirm. ¶ 6), and recently produced documents (see Docket No. 86, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 3-5). \nThis case has had extensive motion practice, in particular surrounding discovery4.  Currently\npending are the County Defendants' objection to this Court's Order to compel production of\ncertain privileged documents, Docket No. 79, see Docket No. 78, Order.\nThe Court established the briefing schedule for this motion, with responses due by\nFebruary 28, 2006, and any reply by March 7, 2006, with the motion then deemed submitted\nwithout oral argument on March 7, 2006 (Docket No. 89).\nMotion for Extensions of Time\nThe Court issued a Scheduling Order on February 23, 2005 (Docket No. 13), which set\ndeadlines for two types of discovery.  First, class certification discovery was to be completed (as\n4See Docket Nos. 16, 22, 25, 40, 79, 80 (motions); see also Docket No. 70; cf. Docket\nNos. 52, 53, 78, 84 (orders).  Included with this motion practice was ancillary motion practice\nsurrounding motion costs for some of the discovery motions, Docket Nos. 55-62, 65, 71.\n2\n\nsubsequently amended) by January 30, 2006 (Docket No. 75), and second, regular case-in-chief\nfact and expert discovery, to be completed by April 6, 2006 (Docket No. 13).  Good cause was\nshown for this extended discovery schedule (Docket No. 13).\nInitially, class certification discovery was to be completed by August 23, 2005, with the\nclass certification motion filed by September 23, 2005, Docket No. 13, Scheduling Order ¶ 2. \nWhile the parties’ first round of discovery motions were pending (see Docket Nos. 16, 22, 25),\nthe parties stipulated to extend the time for the class certification motion, to October 27, 2005\n(Docket No. 27).  The Court’s Order that ruled on the first round of discovery motions also\nextended the class certification motion to December 20, 2005, as the final extension of that\ndeadline (Docket No. 52, Order at 26).  The Court expressly stated that the December 20\nextension was “generous enough to make the motion [for class certification] while not dependent\nupon the vagaries of document production.  This, however, will be the last extension of the class\ncertification deadline” (id.).  The Court concluded that “whatever plaintiffs glean from the\nbooking sheets they receive (and other discovery they obtain) should be sufficient to put together\na motion to certify their proposed class.”  (Id.) \nUnfortunately, that did not turn out to be the case; further extensions were granted.  The\nparties jointly stipulated to extend the class certification discovery and filing of the certification\nmotion (Docket No. 75).  The former was due by January 30, 2006 (the current deadline), and the\nlatter by February 2, 2006 (Docket No. 75).  Plaintiffs wrote on January 30, 2006 (see Docket\nNo. 91, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. Ex. B), seeking a further extension of the deadline for their\nclass certification motion.  The Court granted that request, giving plaintiffs forty-five days to\nmake their motion, or by Monday, March 20, 2006 (Docket Nos. 82, 83).  The deadline to file a\n3\n\nclass certification motion was further extended by one day, to Tuesday, March 21, 2006 (Docket\nNo. 102, Order of Friday, March 17, 2006).\nAt first, no party following plaintiffs’ present motion to compel moved to extend the\ndiscovery for the case-in-chief deadline, although the County Defendants suggest in their\nresponse that this deadline may need to be changed in light of the extensions granted for\nplaintiffs’ class certification motion (see Docket No. 91, County Defs. Atty. Decl. ¶ 28) and\nplaintiffs in reply also indicated that they may so move (Docket No. 93, Pls. Atty. Reply Affirm.\n¶ 9).  \nPlaintiffs now move for the extension of the class certification discovery and the class\ncertification motion deadlines making these dates dependent upon when Judge Curtin rules on\nthe County Defendants’ objections to the privilege Order, with class certification discovery to be\ncompleted within thirty days after Judge Curtin rules, and the class certification motion due\nwithin sixty days of that Decision & Order (Docket Nos. 97, 98).  Plaintiffs also request that\ndiscovery in the case-in-chief conclude by August 6, 2006.  Plaintiffs’ counsel notes defense\nobjections to these extensions (Docket No. 97, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 2; see generally Docket\nNo. 100, County Defs. Atty. Reply Affirm.; Docket No. 101, Gipson Atty. Affirm.), but plaintiffs\nmake this motion to complete their discovery in light of pending discovery regarding the sought\nprivileged documents and the depositions sought in the motion to compel (Docket No. 97, Pls.\nAtty. Affirm. ¶¶ 4-9).  \nAll defendants strenuously object to granting plaintiffs additional time, given plaintiffs’\ndelay in conducting discovery and the impact of prior Orders concluding class certification\n4\n\ndiscovery (see generally Docket No. 100, County Defs. Atty. Reply Affirm.; Docket No. 101,\nGipson Atty. Affirm.).\nRather than delay this decision by a lengthy briefing schedule, and given the\ninterrelationship between the discovery motion and the motion to extend time, the motion for\nextension of time was considered with plaintiffs’ motion to compel and defendants were given\nuntil March 16, 2006, to respond (Docket No. 99), which they did (Docket Nos. 100, 101).\nDISCUSSION\nI. Motion to Compel Depositions\nPlaintiffs contend that this discovery is for both their class certification motion and for the\ncase-in-chief, making their demands timely as main discovery requests.  Defendants argue that\nplaintiffs had conducted little to no discovery related to their class certification motion in the last\nfew months and that this Court’s Order extended the deadline for that motion and expressly did\nnot extend the discovery for it (Docket No. 91, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 7, -8, 26; Docket\nNo. 92, Gipson Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 4-7).  Since the January 30, 2006, deadline for class certification\ndiscovery has passed, all defendants conclude that plaintiffs’ present motion is time barred\n(Docket No. 91, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 26; Docket No. 92, Gipson Atty. Affirm. ¶ 7).  The\nCounty Defendants contend that no one was expected to complete discovery in the case-in-chief\nat the deadline set, with extensions for the class certification motion to be now just one month\naway (Docket No. 91, County Defs. Atty. Decl. ¶ 28).\nPlaintiffs contend that these depositions are tied to documents either that defendants\nbelatedly produced or refused to produce as part of their claimed privilege (currently subject to\nappellate objections pending before Judge Curtin) (e.g., Docket No. 93, Pls. Atty. Reply Affirm.\n5\n\n¶¶ 4-7).  They argue that defendants claim that Judge Curtin’s order staying discovery relative to\nthe privilege documents on appeal (Docket No. 84; see Docket No. 80, County Defendants’\nmotion seeking stay of discovery pursuant to this Court’s order, Docket No. 78, relative to the\nprivilege log documents) was a global stay of factual discovery in this case (see Docket No. 93,\nPls. Reply Affirm. ¶¶ 7, 9; cf. Docket No. 92, Gipson Atty. Affirm. ¶ 27, Ex. C).  There was no\ngeneral stay of discovery (either fact discovery or “post-certification discovery” as termed by\ndefendants (cf. Docket No. 92, Gipson Atty. Affirm. ¶ 31; see also Docket No. 91, County Defs.\nAtty. Affirm. ¶ 29 (arguing that fact discovery should only occur after decision on a class\ncertification motion)), or class certification or “pre-certification” discovery) issued by the Court5.\nThe Court, when it issued the initial Scheduling Order, noted that good cause existed for\nthe extended discovery schedule imposed in that Order and declared that further extensions of\nthat generous schedule would not be granted even for good cause shown (Docket No. 13, Order\nof Feb. 23, 2005, at 1, 2).  Note, plaintiffs are represented by four out of town law firms plus\nlocal counsel; defendants are ably represented by some of the larger firms in this city, with\nseparate counsel for one defendant.  The discovery required for the case-in-chief could have been\ncompleted within the deadline set (even if the parties show good cause for an extension), in part\nbecause much of it was produced in response to the class certification issue.  But, as previously\nnoted, discovery has been dragged out and contentious.\n5The Court in setting the Scheduling Order in this case did not distinguish between pre-\ncertification and post-certification discovery nor did it contemplate that the parties would engage\nexclusively in class certification discovery or not conduct other discovery (whether or not\nplaintiffs move successfully for class certification).\n6\n\nA. Compel Continued Deposition\nPlaintiffs seek to continue the examinations of defendants Gipson, Livingston6, and\nHoward, and Glenn Isch (or Ishe, as identified by plaintiffs, see Docket No. 86, Pls. Atty. Affirm.\n¶ 8), a lieutenant in the Sheriff’s Department.  Defendants argue that the original class\ncertification schedule closed discovery days after plaintiffs sought to resume these examinations. \nPlaintiffs reply that these depositions were held off while parties negotiated a possible settlement\n(Docket No. 97, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 8).\nThe Court originally did not extend the discovery deadline relative to plaintiffs’ class\ncertification motion.  But plaintiffs request for additional time for the class certification motion\n(see Docket No. 91, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. Ex. B) was based upon pending discovery not\nbeing available to include in their motion (Docket No. 93, Pls. Atty. Reply Affirm. ¶ 8). \nPlaintiffs’ discovery here also goes to the case-in-chief, which concluded in April 2006.  The\noriginal Scheduling Order anticipated overlapping discovery for the case-in-chief and for class\ncertification.  But, given this Order’s extension of both class certification and main discovery,\ndefendants’ arguments about timeliness is moot and plaintiffs’ motion is granted.\nDefendants argue that plaintiffs were dilatory in seeking to conclude these depositions\n(see Docket No. 91, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 19- 21, 26).  Plaintiffs countered that\ndefendants revealed documents belatedly that lead to this renewed interest in questioning the\nparties and witnesses (Docket No. 93, Pls. Atty. Reply Affirm. ¶¶ 4-8).  This argument does\n6Plaintiffs now withdraw their request to continue defendant Livingston’s examination,\nDocket No. 93, Pls. Atty. Reply Affirm. ¶ 12 n.2, but reserved the right to reopen this request\nfollowing the Court’s decision on defendants’ objections to the order compelling production of\nthe privilege log documents.\n7\n\nsuggest that the time to conduct these examinations should be brief.  Therefore, within the time\nfor completing discovery set forth in this Order, plaintiffs have forty-five (45) days to conduct\nthese examinations.  Neither party should wait until the last day to commence these examinations\neither to preclude them or to drag out this part of the discovery process.\nB. Compel New Deposition\nPlaintiffs served deposition notices for Jeffrey Hartman, Robert Huggins, and Gerry\nKowalsczyk, Sheriff’s Department employees (Docket No. 86, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 8). \nDefendants object that plaintiffs had not identified these witnesses before, and now do so out of\ntime under the earlier schedule for class certification discovery.  As stated above for the\ncontinued depositions, with this Order’s new deadlines for completing discovery (see infra),\nplaintiffs’ notices of these new witnesses are timely.  Plaintiffs’ motion as to these witnesses are\ngranted.\nII. Costs for Continued Depositions\nPlaintiffs also seek the expenses associated with continuing the examinations of the\nCounty Defendants’ witnesses (such as court reporters, travel costs and other reasonable\nexpenses) (Docket No. 86, Pls. Atty. Affirm. first ¶ 13).  Plaintiffs cite no authority for such\nrelief, save defendants’ agreement to pay these expenses following the late disclosure of three e-\nmail documents.  Rule 37(a)(4)(A) allows a successful movant to recover its motion expenses\nwhen it has to make a motion to compel; there is no provision for awarding the movant what\nwould be its costs in continuing the deposition.  But the parties stipulated to have defendants pay\nthe costs of the continued examinations based upon defendants’ belated production of\ndocuments.  The County Defendants expressed their willingness to “incur reasonable costs with\n8\n\nany additional testimony related to Isch, Howard or [Gipson] as they relate to” three documents\nlately produced to plaintiffs (Docket No. 86, Pls. Atty. Affirm. Ex. SIX, letter of Domalgalski to\npls. counsel, Nov. 14, 2005, at 2).  If the parties wish to agree to this cost shifting (to avoid, for\nexample, a further motion for sanctions for failure to produce the belated documents) that is up to\nthem.  But absent such a written stipulation, cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 29, the Court cannot impose those\nexpenses; plaintiffs’ motion on this point is denied.\nIII. Extensions of Time\nWhen the Court extended time for the class certification motion and agreed to the parties’\nearlier stipulation regarding that schedule, it was anticipated that the parties would complete\nclass-based discovery and plaintiffs then would proceed to make their motion.  Particularly, the\nFebruary 2, 2006, Order (Docket No. 82, see Docket No. 83) presumed that discovery related to\nthe class certification motion was near completion and did not require the time for full blown\ncase-in-chief discovery.  But that Order did not expressly reject plaintiffs’ request to extend class\ncertification discovery.\nThe discovery issues arising in a class certification motion, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), (b),\non the commonality of claims, the typicality of claims of class members and by the representative\nclass members, numerosity of class members, the common action of defendants against plaintiff\nclass members, common questions of law or fact predominate, should have been addressed by\nthe documents and other evidence produced.  The outstanding items, the privilege log documents\nand the further depositions at issue in the present motion to compel and the objections before\nJudge Curtin, certainly could add to the motion to certify the class but were not essential.  The\n9\n\nclass certification motion is determining the existence of a class as of the date that motion is\nconsidered, a snapshot of whether a class exists and, if so, its composition.\nThe Court possesses the authority to decertify or modify a class that proves\nunmanageable, see In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practices Litig., 148 F.3d 283, 321 (3d\nCir. 1998); In re Safety Components, Inc. Secs. Litig., 166 F. Supp. 2d 72, 91 (D.N.J. 2001),\nhence further discovered material may change the nature, composition or even the existence of a\nclass.  Plaintiffs, as parties invoking Rule 23, have the burden of showing that all class\nprerequisites have been met.  See 7A Charles A.. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane,\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 1759, at 122 (Civil 3d ed. 2005); W.D.N.Y. Loc. Civ. R. 23(f);\nsee also Marriott v. Montgomery County, 227 F.R.D. 159, 171 (N.D.N.Y. 2005), aff’d by\nsummary order, No. 05-1590, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 25428 (2d Cir. Nov. 22, 2005); McBean v.\nNew York City, 228 F.R.D. 487, 491-92 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), but the factual allegations in the\nComplaint (including the class allegations) are treated like a motion to dismiss and deemed to be\ntrue, see Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).  “However, plaintiff\nis not required to make an extensive evidentiary showing.”  Marriott, supra, 227 F.R.D. at 171;\nVerdow v. Sutkowy, 209 F.R.D. 309, 311 (N.D.N.Y. 2002).  Further, as noted by the Northern\nDistrict of New York court in Marriott, “courts are implored to construe liberally the Rule 23\nrequirements,” Marriott, supra, 227 F.R.D. at 171, citing Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 391 F.2d\n555, 563 (2d Cir. 1968); Verdow, supra, 209 F.R.D. at 311.  Thus, the February 2, 2006,\nScheduling Order on this point (Docket Nos. 82, 83) intended plaintiffs to go forward with what\nthey have to establish as the existence and scope of their purported class and not upon every\nconceivable piece of evidence available to support their class claims.\n10\n\nDefendants vigorously argue that plaintiffs time to conduct discovery had run, that this\nCourt’s scheduling Orders were law of the case on plaintiffs repeated request to extend class\ncertification discovery (e.g., Docket No. 101, Gipson Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 3, 7, 20). They express the\nfrustration in having plaintiffs move forward and make their class certification motion and\nmaking motions to extend at the eleventh hour (see Docket No. 100, County Defs. Atty. Reply\nAffirm. ¶¶ 12, 11).  They point out that plaintiffs had conducted no class-based discovery from\nNovember 2005 to January 30, 2006 (id. ¶ 14; Docket No. 101, Gipson Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 11, 21). \nThe County Defendants also note that plaintiffs have not supplemented their initial Rule 26(a)\ndisclosure until very recently with their present motions (Docket No. 100, County Defs. Atty.\nAffirm. ¶¶ 16-20).\nDespite the brief era of good feelings and cooperation following the possibility of\ndiscovery sanctions upon counsel in the earlier round of discovery and disclosure motions, see\nDocket No. 58, new disputes have arisen or have been revived (including the present motion and\nthe privilege documents objections and the County Defendants’ objection to plaintiffs’ failure to\ntimely supplement their initial disclosure) that have delayed the anticipated speedy completion of\ndiscovery (both for the class certification and the case in general).  The parties will require time\nonce this Court decides these outstanding matters before a motion for class certification or case-\nin-chief fact discovery can be concluded.  Plaintiffs have moved for extensions of time to push\nback discovery and the motion deadline in light of these disputes (Docket No. 97).  Plaintiffs\nhere are not “cavalierly disregard[ing]” this Court’s Scheduling Orders, see Johnson v.\nMammoth Recreations, Inc., 975 F.2d 604, 610 (9th Cir. 1992) (cf. Docket No. 101, Gipson Atty.\n11\n\nAffirm. ¶ 7), rather they seek extensions of those Orders at the eleventh hour, despite indications\nthat no extensions will be given.\nThe Court must balance upholding its Orders and the schedule they impose with doing\njustice to the parties, especially with putative class members.  Plaintiffs should not be rewarded\nby their counsel apparently sitting on their hands for months at a time not conducting necessary\ndiscovery or apparently readying class certification motion papers.  But the reasons stated for the\nextension (Docket No. 97, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 5-7) go to the discovery issues that are the\nsubject of plaintiffs’ motion to compel, as well as defendants’ pending objections.  Rather than\nhave claims potentially be dismissed as untimely sought and not reaching the underlying merits\ndue to pending discovery disputes7, an extension of time will be granted to (1) complete class\ncertification discovery, in light of the disputes raised in this motion and in the privilege log\nobjections; (2) complete discovery in the case-in-chief; (3) set the dates for motion for class\ncertification; and (4) for dispositive motions.  Plaintiffs’ requested dates (cf. Docket No. 97),\nhowever, will not be adopted.  Rather than tie the dates to when Judge Curtin decides the\noutstanding objections as plaintiffs seek (Docket No. 97, Notice of Motion ¶¶ 1-2), definitive\nextension dates will be set, which are more generous that what plaintiffs sought.\nClass certification discovery shall be completed by May 1, 2006.  Class certification\nmotion shall be filed on or before July 10, 2006.  All discovery (fact and expert in the case-in-\nchief) shall be completed by September 12, 2006; plaintiffs shall identify any experts by\n7If plaintiffs’ motion for extension of time were denied and they failed to file a timely\nclass certification motion by March 20, 2006, they could appeal that denial of class certification,\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f), and possibly further delay reaching the merits as to the individual\nplaintiffs if this Court or the Second Circuit were to stay this action pending that appeal, see id.\n12\n\nJuly 17, 2006, defendants shall identify their experts by August 15, 2006, and all expert\ndiscovery shall conclude by September 1, 2006.  Thus, ample time is given for completion of\nboth classes of discovery (more than plaintiffs sought for case-in-chief discovery) as well as to\nfile a class certification motion.  The Court expects all discovery to be conducted simultaneously. \nDispositive motions shall be filed on or before December 27, 2006.  Enough time has been\nprovided here to complete discovery and whatever motion practice is necessary to reach the\nmerits of plaintiffs’ individual and class claims.  As a result, and as previously stated, there shall\nbe NO FURTHER EXTENSION OF THESE DEADLINES.  Obviously, if the parties can\nperform these activities before these deadlines (such as filing the class certification motion on the\npresent state of the discovery) then so much the better to reaching the merits expeditiously.  This\nOrder is not an invitation for parties to delay further or wait until the eve of deadlines to act or\nseek yet another delay on the now false assumption (based upon past practice) that, if sought,\nmore time will be given by stipulation or Order.  Given the warning in this Order, the Court will\nexpect going forward timely completion of discovery and motion practice and ultimately\nprogressing this case to its merits (see Docket No. 52, Order of Sept. 26, 2005, at 35, concluding\nthat “this case needs to get to its merits”).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, plaintiffs’ motion to compel (Docket No. 86) is granted, as\nconditioned by the terms of this Order.  Plaintiffs’ motion for extensions of time (Docket\nNos. 97, 98) is granted in part, denied in part, with the following dates so ordered.  Class\ncertification discovery shall be completed by May 1, 2006.  Class certification motion shall be\nfiled on or before July 10, 2006.  All discovery (fact and expert in the case-in-chief) shall be\n13\n\ncompleted by September 12, 2006; plaintiffs shall identify any experts by July 17, 2006,\ndefendants shall identify their experts by August 15, 2006, and all expert discovery shall\nconclude by September 1, 2006.  Dispositive motions shall be filed on or before December 27,\n2006.  All previous Scheduling Order deadlines not amended by this Order remain in full effect. \nNO FURTHER EXTENSION OF THESE DEADLINES SHALL BE GRANTED. \nPlaintiffs’ motion for recovery of their costs for continuing the examinations of certain parties\nand witnesses is denied.\nSo Ordered.\n                /s/ Hugh B.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nADAM PRITCHARD, et al.,\n                                                  Plaintiffs,\nHon. Hugh B. Scott \nv.     04CV534C\nOrder\nTHE COUNTY OF ERIE, et al.,\n                                                  Defendants.\nThis is a follow up to a recent series of discovery motions pending before the Court. \nFirst, County Defendants1 moved for a protective Order, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c),\nagainst disclosure of documents “relating to non-strip search related incidents including assaults\nand attempted suicides and unrelated non-strip search e-mail/documents” (Docket No. 116,\nNotice of Motion at 1); second, plaintiffs moved to compel to produce all documents designated\nby defendants as “felony” documents, and to allow plaintiffs to inspect the original documents\nresponsive to their demands (Docket No. 120).\nFollowing a truncated briefing schedule (Docket Nos. 117, 121), on June 26, 2006, this\nCourt ordered the County defendants to produce an “objections” log, describing the documents\nthey declined to produce to plaintiffs and the reasons for that declination, within twenty (20)\n1The “County Defendants” consist of Erie County, its former and present Sheriffs and\nnamed Sheriff’s Department officials who were allegedly responsible for the Erie County\nHolding Center and the Erie County Correctional Facility, all of the defendants in this action save\ndefendant Gipson (who is separately represented).\n\ndays; plaintiffs were to respond to the contents of this log within ten (10) business days (Docket\nNo. 129).  The County Defendants’ motion for a protective order (Docket No. 116) was denied in\npart, granted in part and plaintiffs’ cross-motion (Docket No. 120) was granted in part (Docket\nNo. 129).  Familiarity with this Order is presumed.\nThe County Defendants produced their objections log (Docket No. 134) describing about\n500 documents.  Plaintiffs then filed an attorney’s affirmation (Docket No. 136) which concedes\nthat a vast majority of the documents identified are not relevant to this action (id. ¶ 1), but sought\nin camera inspection of four sets of e-mails.\nDISCUSSION\nCurrently at issue are four sets of e-mails plaintiffs wish the Court to inspect in camera\nfor possible production.  As identified in the County Defendants’ objection log, EC-C 1188 and\nEC-C 1211-1215 involve sexual harassment training by upper management of the Sheriff’s\nDepartment.  Plaintiffs seek these documents to show the level of enforcement by the County\nDefendants of departmental policies, albeit a policy unrelated to strip searches.  The other two\ndocuments, EC-C 1189 and EC-C 1220, are e-mail cover sheets from former Assistant County\nAttorney Kristin Baudo Machelor, apparently from her office e-mail address to her home e-mail\naddress.\nFollowing review of the County Defendants’ objections log and plaintiffs’ asserted\nreasons for seeking these documents (Docket Nos. 134, 136), the Court declines to review these\ndocuments in camera and will now decide upon whether they should be produced.\n2\n\nI. Sexual Harassment Training E-Mails\nAccording to the County Defendants’ log, EC-C 1188 is a memorandum from or for a\nmeeting of Sheriff’s Department administrators regarding sexual harassment training.  From the\nlog, there is nothing indicating the implementation of the policy (or the training) and all this\ninvolves the Sheriff’s sexual harassment policy, far afield from the policy for conducting\ndetainee searches.  The documents identified as EC-C 1211 to 1215 are a string of e-mails\nbetween Sheriff’s officials and the County Attorney’s office regarding the sexual harassment\npolicy, medical records authorization forms and HIPAA forms and compliance (Docket No. 134,\nCounty Defs. log).  Defendants also assert attorney-client privilege for these documents (id.).\nPlaintiffs fail to establish how documents regarding another Sheriff’s Department policy\n(or even its implementation) is relevant to the claims raised regarding searches of inmates and\nadherence (or not) to the departmental policy therefor.  Nor do plaintiffs address the attorney-\nclient privilege asserted for EC-C 1211-15.  Thus, the documents sought regarding the Sheriff’s\nDepartment sexual harassment policy, EC-C 1188, EC-C1211-1215, should not be produced.\nII. Machelor Transmission E-Mails\nThese documents appear to be e-mail transmission cover sheets sent by former Assistant\nCounty Attorney Machelor between her home and work e-mail addresses.  Plaintiffs intend to use\nthese documents to establish that Machelor used her home e-mail address as well as her office e-\nmail address.  (Docket No. 136, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 2.)  While it is not initially clear what\nrelevance the fact that an attorney uses her home and work e-mail addresses, it may lead to\ndiscovery of admissible evidence, cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  Absent objections by the County\n3\n\nDefendants on privilege grounds (which they have not asserted) and the fact that these covering\ndocuments do not have whatever attachments to them, they should be produced.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above and as previously determined (Docket No. 129), the County\nDefendants’ motion for a protective order (Docket No. 116) is granted in part, denied in part;\nnamely, that defendants are to produce EC-C 1189, EC-C 1220, but may withhold EC-C 1188,\nEC-C1211-1215 as well as the other documents plaintiffs now concede are beyond the scope of\nthis litigation.  As a result, plaintiffs’ motion to compel (Docket No. 120) is granted in part in\nso far an the “objections” log will be created, but denied in part in so far as not obtaining the\nwithheld documents.\nSo Ordered.\n                /s/ Hugh B.

Defendants responded, and filed a\ncross-motion (Item 247) to strike certain matters from plaintiffs’ certification motion\npapers.  The Court heard oral argument of these motions on March 24, 2010.  For the\nreasons stated, plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is granted, and defendants’\ncross-motion to strike is granted.\nBACKGROUND\nThis action was filed in July 2004 by proposed representative plaintiffs Adam\nPritchard and Edward Robinson1 seeking injunctive relief, money damages and attorneys'\nfees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, individually and on behalf of a putative class of\n1 Julenne Tucker was also named as a class representative.  However, plaintiff’s\ncounsel has moved to discontinue the claims of plaintiff Tucker and to withdraw as Mr. Tucker’s\ncounsel.  Because the certification motion seeks representative status on behalf of only Adam\nPritchard and Edward Robinson, and in the absence of any showing with regard to Mr. Tucker’s\nadequacy as a class representative or any objection to this motion by defendants, the motion to\ndiscontinue Mr. Tucker as class representative is now granted, as is counsel’s request to\nwithdraw from his representation of Mr. Tucker on an individual basis.\n\npost-arraignment pre-trial detainees charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes\nwho entered the Erie County Holding Center in downtown Buffalo (ECHC) or the Erie\nCounty Correctional Facility in Alden (ECCF) between July 22, 2001 and May 1, 2004. \nPlaintiffs allege that, beginning in 2001, the Sheriff's Department implemented a policy to\nconduct an invasive strip search of every such detainee at the time they changed from\nstreet clothes to a prison uniform (a procedure called \"change-out\"), without regard for the\nseverity  of  the  offense  alleged  and  without  individualized  reasonable  suspicion  of\npossession of weapons or contraband, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Named as\ndefendants are the County of Erie; Patrick Gallivan, former Erie County Sheriff; Timothy\nHoward, former Undersheriff; Donald Livingston, Superintendent of the ECCF; Robert\nHuggins, former Deputy Superintendent of the ECCF; and H. McCarthy Gipson, former\nSuperintendent of the ECHC.\nThe County, along with individual defendants Gallivan, Howard, Livingston, and\nHuggins (referred to collectively as the “County defendants”), filed an answer generally\ndenying the existence of a policy to conduct strip searches without regard to individualized\nsuspicion or the offense alleged, and asserting several affirmative defenses.  Defendant\nGipson filed a separate answer with the same or substantially similar denials and defenses.\nBy their renewed motion, plaintiffs seek certification of the following class:\nAll persons who have been placed into the custody of the Erie County\nCorrectional Facility and/or the Erie County Holding Center after being\ncharged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole,\ntraffic infractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and were strip\nsearched upon their entry into the Erie County Correctional Facility and/or\nthe Erie County Holding Center pursuant to the policy, custom and practice\nof the Erie County Sheriff's Department and the County of Erie.  The class\nperiod commences on July 22, 2001 and extends until May 1, 2004. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their\n-2-\n\nrespective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or\nassignees.\n(Item 239, pp. 1-2).  Plaintiffs request that the Court certify this action as a money\ndamages class action under Rule 23(b)(3).  In the alternative, plaintiffs seek partial\ncertification under Rule 23(c)(4).\nDefendants respond that a class cannot be certified in this case because plaintiffs\nhave failed to come forward with proof that the County's facially valid search policy was\nunconstitutional.  Defendants also argue that the proposed representative plaintiffs are\ninadequate and atypical of the proposed class because Mr. Pritchard (the only proposed\nclass representative searched at the ECCF) was a parole violator, which carries a different\nlegal status than an arrestee on a misdemeanor or other minor crime, and that Mr.\nRobinson (the only proposed representative searched at the ECHC) was searched outside\nthe class period (see Item 245).2\nThe County defendants have also filed a cross-motion (Item 247) seeking an order\nstriking certain exhibits and unsupported allegations from the plaintiffs' motion papers. \nEach motion is discussed in turn.\n2\nDefendant Gipson adopts the factual statements, arguments, and other matters put forth by the\nCounty defendants (see Item 250).  It is noted that defendants did not seek Court approval prior to filing\ntheir 40-page responding memorandum of law, well in excess of the 25-page limit of Local Rule 7.1(f).\n-3-\n\nDISCUSSION\nI. Motion for Class Certification\nA. Applicable Law\nThe certification of class actions is governed by Rule 23, which provides in pertinent\npart: \n(a) Prerequisites. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as\nrepresentative parties on behalf of all members only if:\n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable;\n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;\n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class.\n(b) Types of Class Actions. A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a)\nis satisfied and if:\n* * * \n(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final\ninjunctive  relief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief  is\nappropriate respecting the class as a whole; or\n(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to\nclass members predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members, and that a class action is superior to other\navailable methods for fairly and efficiently 5 adjudicating the\ncontroversy.  The matters pertinent to these findings include:\n-4-\n\n(A) the class members' interests in individually\ncontrolling  the  prosecution  or  defense  of\nseparate actions;\n(B)  the  extent  and  nature  of  any  litigation\nconcerning the controversy already begun by or\nagainst class members\n(C)  the  desirability  or  undesirability  of\nconcentrating the litigation of the claims in the\nparticular forum; and\n(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class\naction.\n(c) Certification Order; Notice to Class Members; Judgment; Issues Classes;\nSubclasses.\n* * *\n(4) Particular Issues.  When appropriate, an action may be\nbrought  or  maintained  as  a  class  action  with  respect  to \nparticular issues.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23.\nMost courts that have addressed class certification in the context of prison strip\nsearches have proceeded under Rule 23(b)(3).  See, e.g., In re Nassau County Strip\nSearch Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 225 (2d Cir. 2006); Williams v. County of Niagara, 2008 WL\n4501918 (Sept. 29, 2008); Mitchell v. County of Clinton, 2007 WL 1988716 (N.D.N.Y. July\n5, 2007).  \nTo achieve class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs must (1) satisfy the\nfour requirements of Rule 23(a) (numerosity, typicality, commonality, and adequacy of\nrepresentation); (2) demonstrate that common \"questions of law or fact\" predominate over\n\"any questions affecting only individual members;\" and (3) establish that the class action\nmechanism is \"superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of\n-5-\n\nthe controversy.\"  In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 225 (internal\nquotations and citation  omitted) (reversing district court's denial of class certification\nmotion in jail strip search case).\nB. Numerosity\n The numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1) is satisfied by a showing that, due to\nthe number of potential class members, joinder of individual members as named plaintiffs\nwould be impracticable.  See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473,\n483 (2d Cir. 1995).  In this case, the numerosity of plaintiff's proposed class is supported\nby  defendants’  production  of  booking  records  indicating  that  approximately  45,000\nindividuals were admitted to the ECHC or ECCF during the class period from July 2001 to\nMay 2004.  Plaintiffs' counsel reasonably estimates that the class size is, at a minimum\n30,000 individuals.  Accepting as true the allegation that these detainees were all subjected\nto the strip searches during the change-out procedure upon their admission, this class size\nis more than adequate to meet the numerosity requirement.  See, e.g., Mitchell, 2007 WL\n1988716, at *2 (numerosity established in strip search class action where class would\nnumber \"well into the hundreds, very likely over a thousand\"); Williams v. County of\nNiagara, 2008 WL 4501918, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. September 29, 2008) (numerosity established\nin  strip  search  class  action  where  plaintiffs  estimated  class  size  to  be  over  8,000\nindividuals).\n-6-\n\nC. Commonality and Typicality\nUnder Rule 23(a)(2), plaintiffs must show commonality, that is, that the action raises \n\"questions of law or fact common to the class.\"  Under 23(a)(3), plaintiffs must also show\nthat “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or\ndefenses of the class.”  As explained by the Second Circuit, these requirements “tend to\nmerge into one another, so that similar considerations animate analysis of Rules 23(a)(2)\nand (3).”  Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 376 (2d Cir. 1997) (citing General Tel. Co.\nof Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n. 13 (1982)).  The commonality requirement\nis met if plaintiffs' claims share a common question of law or of fact.  Id.; see also  In re\nAgent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d 145, 166-67 (2d Cir. 1987). The typicality\nrequirement “is satisfied when each class member's claim arises from the same course of\nevents, and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant's\nliability.”  In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc., 960 F.2d 285, 291 (2d Cir. 1992).\nIn this case, there is ample proof in the documents and testimony presented to the\nCourt to support the claim that a significant number of detainees admitted to the ECHC and\nECCF during the class period were subjected to a strip search at change-out.  However,\nthe proof also indicates that the two facilities had different procedures.  As to ECCF,\nplaintiff’s allege that a written policy existed directing strip searches for all detainees,\nincluding those charges with minor crimes.  In contrast, plaintiff’s allege that ECHC had a\nuniform practice (as opposed to a written policy) of conducting strip searches for all\ndetainees, including those charged with minor crimes.  In light of the existence of two\ndifferent strip search procedures conducted at different facilities, the Court finds that it is\n-7-\n\nappropriate to divide each group into a different subclass, as defined below.  Dividing the\ngroups into subclasses will enhance the commonality and typicality requirements as to\neach subclass. As divided, the claims of each subclass raise factual and legal questions\nthat are common to the class, requiring the same or similar arguments to prosecute their\nclaims  as  would  be  made  by  members  of  the  proposed  class.    Accordingly,  the\ncommonality and typicality requirements are met.\nE. Adequacy of Representation\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the class representatives “fairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class.” Adequate representation depends on two factors: (a) the\nplaintiffs' attorney must be qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the\nproposed litigation; and (b) the class members must not have interests antagonistic to one\nanother.  In re Joint Eastern and Southern Dist. Asbestos Litigation, 78 F.3d 764, 778 (2d.\nCir. 1996). \nWith regard to the first factor, there is no question that plaintiffs’ counsel have\nextensive experience in this type of complex class litigation, requiring more than a working\nknowledge of the applicable law.  See, e.g., Williams, 2008 WL 4501918, at * 4; Mitchell,\n2007 WL 1988716, at *6; see also Kelsey v. County of Schoharie, 2007 WL 603406\n(N.D.N.Y. February 21, 2007), rev’d, 567 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. May 22, 2009) (process for\nexchange of personal clothing for prison clothing under observation of corrections officer\nin the manner described by plaintiffs does not fall within prohibitions established by Circuit\nprecedents relating to strip searches).  Counsel have also adequately demonstrated that\nthey have done a significant amount of work in identifying and investigating potential\n-8-\n\nclaims, and there can be no question that they have already committed substantial\nresources to representing the class.  See, e.g., In re County of Erie (Erie I), 473 F.3d 413\n(2d Cir. 2007);  In re County of Erie (Erie II), 546 F.3d 222 (2d Cir. 2008).   Rule 23(g)(1)\nrequires the Court to consider the following factors in appointing class counsel:  (i) the work\ncounsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action; (ii) counsel's\nexperience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of claims\nasserted in the action; (iii) counsel's knowledge of the applicable law; and (iv) the\nresources that counsel will commit to representing the class.  The Court finds that the\nrequirements of Rule 23(g)(1) have been met and counsel is competent to adequately\nlitigate this matter on behalf of the class.\nWith regard to the adequacy of the class member-representatives, there is no\nindication that the class members would have interests antagonistic to one another. \nDefendants contend that Pritchard — the only proposed class representative searched at\nthe ECCF — is inadequate because his search occurred following his arrest for a parole\nviolation.  Defendants contend that parole is a unique legal custodial status not carrying\nthe same constitutional protections against unreasonable searches enjoyed by the rest of\nthe proposed class.  There is ample precedent from courts within the Second Circuit,\nincluding this Court, indicating that a violation of parole status does not in and of itself\nprovide justification for a strip search upon admission to a correctional facility.  Cf. Marriott\nv. County of Montgomery, 426 F. Supp.2d 1 (N.D.N.Y. 2006) (awarding summary judgment\nto class of pretrial detainees, including parole violators, who were subjected to blanket strip\nsearch policy); Dodge v. County of Orange, 209  F.R.D. 65, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (finding no\nbasis to conclude that admission to correctional facility upon violation of probation or parole\n-9-\n\nin and of itself provides individualized reasonable suspicion for strip search); Black v.\nAmico, 387 F. Supp. 88, 90-92 (W.D.N.Y. 1974) (parole status of visitor to ECHC did not\nprovide justification for strip search).  In addition, in a similar class action brought by\npre-trial detainees challenging strip search policies and practices at the Niagara County\nJail, this Court recently certified a class which included individuals admitted to the jail after\nbeing charged with violations of the conditions of parole or probation.  See Williams, 2008\nWL 4501918, at *5.  Accordingly, defendants’ challenge to the adequacy of plaintiff\nPritchard is denied. \nWith respect to Robinson — the only proposed representative searched at the\nECHC — defendants contend that the search took place on May 15, 2004, outside the\nproposed class period from July 22, 2001 through May 1, 2004.   Contrary to the\ndefendants’ contention, however, Robinson has testified that he was strip searched at\nECHC on at least two occasions during the class period - once on February 17, 2002 and\na second time on July 5, 2002.  He further asserts that both of those searches occurred \nafter being arrested on misdemeanor charges.  In light of that testimony, the Court finds\ndefendants’ challenge to the adequacy of plaintiff Robinson also without merit. \n  F. Predominance and Superior Method\nHaving found that plaintiffs have met the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), the court must\nnext determine whether plaintiffs have adequately demonstrated that common questions\npredominate over questions affecting individual plaintiffs, and that a class action is the best\nmethod of adjudicating this case.  To meet the predominance requirement, plaintiffs must\nshow that the issues in the action that are subject to generalized proof, and applicable to\n-10-\n\nthe class as a whole, predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized\nproof.  See In re Visa Check/Master Money Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 136 (2d Cir.\n2001).\nThe Court has little difficulty concluding that the questions raised by plaintiffs\nregarding the existence of the alleged strip search policies at ECCF and ECHC, the\nconstitutionality of those practices and policies, and the ultimate liability of the County and\nthe individual defendants, are common to all potential class members and are subject to\ngeneralized, class-wide proof.  These issues predominate over those issues that are\nsubject to individualized proof.  See In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at\n228.  As noted by the Second Circuit in that case, “when plaintiffs are allegedly aggrieved\nby a single policy of defendants, such as the blanket policy at issue here, the case\npresents precisely the type of situation for which the class action device is suited since\nmany nearly identical litigations can be adjudicated in unison.”  Id. (internal quotations and\ncitation omitted).  The division of the proposed class into two subclasses heightens the\npredominance as to issues common to the subclass members.  See Williams, 2008\nWL4501918, at * 3-4. \nMoreover, as in Williams and Mitchell, the circumstances of this case make it highly\nunlikely that many members of the class would have the resources to pursue their claims\nindividually in separate actions, or that separate actions would result in better outcomes\nfor the claimants.  “In light of the nature of the issues and the flexibility accorded to courts\nin handling class actions, it is unlikely that the management of this case as a class action\nwill present inordinate difficulties.” Mitchell, 2007 WL 1988716 at *5.\n-11-\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that common questions predominate over questions\naffecting individual plaintiffs, and that a class action is superior to other available methods\nfor the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\n \nG. Rule 23(c)(4)\nHaving determined to certify the class under Rule 23(b)(3), the Court need not\nconsider whether partial certification under Rule 23(c)(4) would also be appropriate.  In re\nNassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 230 n. 4.\nH. Subclasses Defined\nHaving determined that all of the requirements for class certification have been met,\nthe Court hereby certifies the class as follows: \nAll persons who have been placed into the custody of the Erie County\nCorrectional Facility and/or the Erie County Holding Center after being\ncharged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole,\ntraffic infractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and were strip\nsearched upon their entry into the Erie County Correctional Facility and/or\nthe Erie County Holding Center pursuant to the policy, custom and practice\nof the Erie County Sheriff's Department and the County of Erie.  The class\nperiod commences on July 22, 2001 and extends until May 1, 2004. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their\nrespective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or\nassignees;\nSubclass A\nAll class members who were placed in the custody of the Erie County\nHolding Center during the class period; \nSubclass B\n-12-\n\nAll class members who were placed in the Erie County Correctional Facility\nduring the class period. \nII. Motion to Strike\nDefendants have also filed a motion to strike certain matters contained in plaintiffs’ \nsubmissions offered in support of the renewed motion for class certification.  Specifically\ndefendants request that the Court issue an order striking from the record Exhibit Y attached\nto Item 236 (Keach Affidavit In Support of Renewed Motion), which is a memorandum of\nlaw from plaintiffs’ prior motion to compel.  The prior motion sought production of privileged\ne-mail communications which the Second Circuit has since held to be protected by the\nattorney-client privilege and not subject to any waiver.  See Erie I and Erie II, supra.\nDefendants also request that the Court strike from plaintiffs’ memorandum of law in support\nof the renewed motion statements suggesting that Sheriff's Department Officer Lisa\nJenkins  coached deputies to testify at their depositions that no strip searches were being\nconducted at the ECHC.\nNotwithstanding ample opportunity to do so, plaintiffs have not responded to\ndefendants’ motion to strike.  Accordingly, the motion is granted.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated herein, the Court grants plaintiffs' renewed motion for class\ncertification (Item 235), and it is therefore\nORDERED that the following class is certified pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3):\nAll persons who have been placed into the custody of the Erie County\nCorrectional Facility and/or the Erie County Holding Center after being\ncharged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole,\n-13-\n\ntraffic infractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and were strip\nsearched upon their entry into the Erie County Correctional Facility and/or\nthe Erie County Holding Center pursuant to the policy, custom and practice\nof the Erie County Sheriff's Department and the County of Erie.  The class\nperiod commences on July 22, 2001 and extends until May 1, 2004. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their\nrespective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or\nassignees;\nSubclass A\nAll class members who were placed in the custody of the Erie County\nHolding Center during the class period; \nSubclass B\nAll class members who were placed in the Erie County Correctional Facility\nduring the class period;  \nand it is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs' attorneys of record are appointed as class counsel\npursuant to Rule 23(g); and it is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs shall have 60 days from the date of this Order to identify\nand move for the addition of another representative of the class members who were\nsearched upon admission to the Erie County Correctional Facility, in particular, one who\nwas not on parole at the time; and it is further\nORDERED that defendants’ unopposed cross-motion (Item 247) to strike certain\nportions of the submissions made by plaintiffs is granted.  The Clerk of the Court is\ndirected to take the steps necessary to remove from the record Exhibit Y attached to Item\n236, and to remove from the record Item 249 (Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’\nRenewed Motion for Class Certification) in its entirety, and plaintiffs are directed to re-\n-14-\n\nsubmit Item 249 deleting any reference to Sheriff's Department Officer Lisa Jenkins; and\nit is further \nORDERED that this case is referred back to Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott for all\npretrial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 636(b)(1)(A) and (B), all pre-trial\nmatters in this case are referred to the above-named United States Magistrate Judge,\nincluding but not limited to: (1) conduct of a scheduling conference and entry of a\nscheduling order pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16, (2) hearing and disposition of all\nnon-dispositive motions or applications, (3) supervision of discovery, and (4) supervision\nof all procedural matters involving the aforementioned or involving the preparation of the\ncase or any matter therein for consideration by the District Judge. The Magistrate Judge\nshall also hear and report upon dispositive motions for the consideration of the District\nJudge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 636(b)(1)(B) and (C). \nSO ORDERED.\ns/ Richard J.

Hugh B.

This case was referred to the undersigned with full pretrial authority (Docket\nNo. 5).\n1Plaintiffs misidentify defendant Gipson as “Gibson.”  Cf. Docket No. 33, Pls. Atty.\nAffirm. ¶ 2.\n2This motion substitutes for an earlier motion, Docket No. 38, that defendants attempted\nto file.  That earlier motion was garbled in transmission and was terminated from the motion list.\n\nBACKGROUND\nDefendants here are Erie County, its former Sheriff Patrick Gallivan, present Sheriff\nTimothy Howard, and various Sheriff’s Department officials responsible for the Erie County\nHolding Center and Erie County Correctional Facility.  Note, currently no Sheriff’s deputy or\nlower ranked officer is a party in this action.  Plaintiffs currently are three persons formerly\nincarcerated in either facility for non-felony violation, misdemeanor or traffic infractions.  They\nallege that they were strip searched while in County custody in 2003-04 (Docket No. 1, Compl.\n¶¶ 3-5).  Plaintiffs allege a class consisting of others who were similarly strip searched, from\nJuly 22, 2001, while entering either the Holding Center or the Correctional Facility regardless of\nthe offense charged against them (see Docket No. 1, Compl. at 1-2, ¶ 15), although the named\nplaintiffs allege being searched later.  By stipulation, the motion for class certification has been\nadjourned to October 21, 2005 (see Docket No. 28; see also Docket No. 13, Scheduling Order\n(setting motion to certify class deadline to Aug. 28, 2005)).3\nDefendants answered (Docket No. 3, Gallivan, Howard, Huggins, Livingston, Erie\nCounty; Docket No. 4, Gipson), alleging cross-claims against each other.  On June 23, 2005,\nthese defendants entered into a stipulation to dismiss these cross-claims (Docket No. 15).\nPlaintiffs announce in these motion papers that claims by plaintiff Julenne Tucker as a\nclass representative (Docket No. 25, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 10 n.1) and generally (see Docket\nNo. 33, Pls. Atty. Aff. ¶ 10) may be dismissed upon counsel contacting Tucker.\n3The Scheduling Order in this case closed discovery on class certification on August 23,\n2005; closes fact and expert discovery by April 6, 2006, and scheduled dispositive motions by\nAugust 15, 2006, Docket No. 13, Feb. 23, 2005.\n2\n\nDefendants’ Motions to Compel\nThe County Defendants seek an Order compelling plaintiffs to respond to their discovery\ndemands, seeking as a sanction preclusion of evidence at trial (Docket No. 16).  They objected to\nthe initial disclosures made by plaintiffs, contending that they failed to fully identify witnesses\n(id., County Defs. Atty Aff. ¶¶ 5-19, Exs. B, C), provide witness statements (id. ¶ 20), or a\ncomputation of their damages (id. ¶¶ 21-23).  They also seek plaintiffs document production (id.\n¶¶ 28-29, Exs. D, E), in particular documents related to the allegations in the Complaint;\nstatements by County employees past or present; documents regarding the arrests of plaintiffs\nRobinson and Tucker (id. ¶ 39, Ex. D, document requests 1, 2, 13, 14).  They further seek\nanswers to their Interrogatories (id. ¶¶ 40-41, Ex. F, E), in particular queries about plaintiffs\nRobinson and Tucker (id. ¶¶ 44, 45).   These defendants outlined their conferences with plaintiffs\nin an attempt to obtain this material (id. ¶¶ 53-55).\nDefendant Gipson also moves for an Order to compel plaintiffs, seeking to preclude\nadmission of evidence for plaintiffs’ failure to produce (Docket No. 22).  Gipson claims that\nplaintiffs failed to produce any documents to him or answer his Interrogatories (Docket No. 23,\nGipson Atty. Aff. ¶¶ 6, 11).\nPlaintiffs’ Omnibus Motion\nPursuant to the status conference held on August 3, 2005 (Docket No. 21), the Court gave\nthe parties until August 10, 2005, to file any additional motions on subjects discussed during that\nconference.  Plaintiffs then moved for several forms of relief (to compel production of booking\nsheets and answers to interrogatories regarding the dismissal of cross-claims against defendant\nGipson, to obtain a protective order against speaking objections during depositions, to grant them\n3\n\nleave to intervene two additional parties as plaintiff-representatives (Docket No. 25)).  But\nplaintiffs filed this motion a day after the deadline set by this Court’s direction (see Docket No.\n21) and also without filing any proof of service.  This is striking since (as noted during the\nAugust 3, 2005, conference, cf. Docket No. 21) plaintiffs objected to defendants sending\ncorrespondence to the Court without copying all of plaintiffs’ counsel. Plaintiffs, thus, needed to\nfile proof of service of this motion.  Upon instruction from chambers, plaintiffs did file\ncertificates of service for the motion papers filed (Docket Nos. 36, 37)4.  In order to not delay this\naction further, this motion was governed by the briefing schedule described below for the defense\nmotions.\nCounty Defendants’ Motion for Protective Order\nAt the August 3, 2005, conference, defense counsel for the County Defendants raised\ntheir objection to plaintiffs’ counsel contacting certain County Sheriff’s department employees\noutside of defense counsel’s presence (see Docket No. 21).  Plaintiffs then replied that they only\nspoke to Sheriff’s department employees to serve them with subpoenas.  The County Defendants\n4Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(d) requires that a certificate of service be filed with a\ncopy of the served paper.  See 4B Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 1150, at 458 (Civil 3d ed. 2002).  The Court may deny a motion because no\ncertificate of service was attached to it.  See Evans v. Port Auth. of N.Y. and N.J., 246 F. Supp.\n2d 343, 344 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); Marbly v. Home Properties of N.Y., 183 F. Supp. 2d 950, 954\n(E.D. Mich. 2002).  Even with the Court’s Electronic Case Filing system parties are still required\nto file proof of service.  See W.D.N.Y. Admin. Procedures Guide ¶ 2(f)(ii), at 6 (June 2004). \nPlaintiffs’ counsel assumed that this District’s rule was similar to his understanding of the\nNorthern District of New York’s rule that the Electronic Case Filing notice of filing also served\nas proof of service without requiring filing a separate document, but cf. N.D.N.Y. Gen. Order 22,\nAdmin. Procedures for Electronic Case Filing 5.3 (Dec. 3, 2004) (court still requires certificate of\nservice). \nNevertheless, defendants have responded to plaintiffs’ motion (Docket Nos. 31, 33)\nwithout raising an objection to the lack of proof of service.  The Court will consider plaintiffs’\nomnibus motion and their response to defendants’ motions.  \n4\n\napparently dropped the matter (Docket No. 41, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 10).  But plaintiffs\nrenewed their intention to question as witnesses Sheriff’s department employees, contending that\nthey are not represented by defense counsel (id. Ex. B), and the County Defendants renewed their\nobjection (id. ¶¶ 11, 12, Ex. D).  Despite this Court’s Order (Docket No. 28; see Docket No. 44)\ncalling for motions on issues raised on August 3, 2005, to be filed by August 10, 2005, the\nparties stipulated to the County Defendants making their motion for a protective order by August\n22, 2005 (Docket No. 41, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 12-13).  The County Defendants’ last\nmotion (Docket No. 40) obviously was beyond the August 10, 2005, motion deadline, but that\nmotion alleged actions by plaintiffs after that deadline that require the Court to consider this\notherwise late motion (see Docket No. 44).\nBriefing Schedules\n In order to expedite this matter, the parties entered into stipulations to a filing and\nbriefing schedule for these motions (letter of James Domagalski to chambers, Aug. 9, 2005). \nPursuant to the parties’ stipulated schedule, responses to all motions then pending were due on or\nbefore August 17, 2005, and any reply was due on or before September 1, 2005.  As for the\nCounty Defendants’ motion for a protective order, responses were due by September 1, 2005, and\nany reply was due by September 16, 2005 (Docket No. 44).  Oral argument for all motions was\nheld on September 20, 2005, and the motions then were deemed submitted and the Court\nreserved decision.  (Docket Nos. 28, 34, 44, 51.)\nDISCUSSION\nThe tenor of the moving papers in this action (e.g., Docket No. 47, Pls. Reply Affirm.\n¶ 2), argument of these motions, and prior submissions to and appearances in this Court, indicate\n5\n\na rancor and vitriol that is contrary to the spirit of the discovery and pretrial rules in this Court.  \nCounsel have accused each other of stonewalling (Docket No. 29, County Defs. Memo. at 1;\nDocket No. 45, County Defs. Reply Affirm. ¶ 3), making frivolous or unsubstantiated discovery\nrequests or claims (e.g., Docket No. 30, County Defs. Affirm. ¶¶ 4-6; cf. Docket No. 47, ¶ 2). \nOne part of plaintiffs’ omnibus motion (Docket No. 25, Pls. Motion Affirm. ¶ 19) and\ndefendants’ response to that motion (Docket No. 30, County Defs. Affirm. ¶¶ 67-73) address\nhow depositions were conducted, alleging conduct that may violate Rule 30.  This atmosphere of\nlitigation has resulted in multiple motions and acrimony where it is not required.  If necessary,\nthe Court may take a more hands-on approach to managing discovery in this action.  As parties\nare aware, such an approach is time consuming and potentially expensive for all concerned.  It is\nhoped that future conduct of this case will not warrant such extreme judicial intervention in\nprocesses that are designed to run without such participation.\nI. Motions to Compel\nA. Standard\nDiscovery under the Federal Rules is intended to reveal relevant documents and\ntestimony, but this process is supposed to occur with a minimum of judicial intervention.  See\n8A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§ 2288, at 655-65 (Civil 2d 1994).  “Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not\nprivileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party, including the existence,\ndescription, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible\nthings and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  Initial disclosure includes producing “a copy of, or a description by\n6\n\ncategory and location of, all documents . . . that are in the possession, custody, or control of the\nparty and that the disclosing party may use to support its claims . . . .”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 26(a)(1)(B).  Evasive or incomplete disclosure is to be treated like a failure to disclose.  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 37(a)(3).\nAll defendants move to compel and for other relief under Rule 37(a)(2)(A) (failure to\nproduce initial disclosure), (B) (failure to respond to document demands or interrogatories), or\n(c)(1) (failure to disclose initial disclosure precludes use of material not disclosed as evidence),\n(2) (failure to respond to admit to genuineness of document), although Gipson does not complain\nabout plaintiffs’ initial disclosure.  (Docket No. 16, County Defs.’ Notice of Motion at 1; Docket\nNo. 22, Gipson’s Notice of Motion at 1.)  Failure to produce and compelling the opponent to\nseek an order compelling discovery exposes the party (and/or its attorney) to sanctions.  See\ngenerally id. R. 37.  Even if the party produces discovery in the face of a motion to compel, that\nparty remains subject to Rule 37 sanctions, see id. R. 37(a)(4)(A).  \nB. Application\nFirst, none of the moving defendants complain that plaintiffs failed to admit to the\ngenuineness of a document or to any fact, hence relief under Rule 37(c)(2) is not applicable here.\n1. County Defendants\na. Initial Disclosure\nThe County Defendants seek initial disclosure identifying the potential class members\nand witnesses as well as discovery demands and interrogatories to flesh out the arrest histories of\nplaintiffs Robinson and Tucker.  During oral argument, they asserted that plaintiffs did not reveal\ninformation about two witnesses who eventually were deposed and were the apparent source of\n7\n\nplaintiffs’ contention of a de facto strip search policy.  As for the initial disclosure, plaintiffs\nobject to providing the names and addresses of individuals they interviewed since they now\ndeclare that the do not intend to call them as witnesses and that production of the list would be\nrevealing attorney work product (Docket No. 33, Pls. Memo. at 1).  The County Defendants reply\nthat they seek only the witnesses to the alleged strip searches, not those plaintiffs’ counsel\ninterviewed (Docket No. 45, County Defs. Reply Affirm. ¶ 21), also arguing that even if they\nsought counsel’s interview notes they would not constitute attorney work product (id. ¶ 27).\nPlaintiffs probably undertook this effort to identify possible class members as well as\npotential witnesses to strip searches.  Rule 26(a)(1)(A) calls for disclosure of names and (if\nknown) addresses and telephone numbers of “each individual likely to have discoverable\ninformation that the disclosing party may use to support its claim . . . identifying the subjects of\ninformation.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 2000 Adv. Comm. Notes\n(2000) (hereinafter “2000 Advisory Notes”).  If plaintiffs intend to stay with their position, they\nmay be precluded at a latter time from using any undisclosed persons, even at a pretrial stage. \nSee 2000 Advisory Notes at 731.  Under Rule 26(a), parties are to disclose known witnesses.\nTherefore, plaintiffs are to produce initial disclosure as known to plaintiffs to date.  See\nalso Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e) (duty to supplement).  Namely, plaintiffs are to disclose individuals\nlikely to have discoverable information that they intend to use during the course of this action\n(including potential parties and witnesses as well as other uses), with the caveat that plaintiffs\nwill not be allowed to use known but undisclosed persons.  This eliminates plaintiffs’ expressed\nconcern about revealing attorney work product because plaintiffs identify only those persons they\nintend to use during the course of this litigation and this need not be all of the people contacted\n8\n\nby plaintiffs’ counsel.  Plaintiffs thus would have to make a judgment now as to whom they\nintend to use.  This disclosure is especially pertinent to identifying the potential scope of the class\nalleged, its numerosity, commonality of facts and claims, and other characteristics leading to the\ndetermination of the existence of a class here.  Therefore, the County Defendants’ motion is\ngranted.\nb. Discovery Demands and Interrogatories\nAs for the County Defendants’ discovery demands, plaintiffs respond that, where\ndocuments exist, they will supplement their responses within one week of their moving papers\n(Docket No. 33, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 3-10).  As for Interrogatory 1, plaintiffs complain that it\nrequires them to identify the class members who number in the thousands and is an example of\noppression by interrogatory and grossly overbroad (id. ¶ 8).  Plaintiffs also consider\nInterrogatory 8 overbroad because it calls for describing the searches of thousands of persons\n(id.).\nThe County Defendants respond, in particular, that plaintiffs have not produced materials\nplaintiff Robinson stated in his deposition that he would attempt to locate (Docket No. 45,\nCounty Defs. Reply Affirm. ¶¶ 29-33) and no materials were produced for plaintiff Tucker (id.\n¶¶ 37-38).  If plaintiffs intended to withdraw claims by Tucker, they either should do so promptly\nor produce his materials (id.).\nGiven plaintiffs’ promise to produce or supplement, the County Defendants’ motion is\ngranted in part, modified in part, and otherwise deemed moot where plaintiffs have pledged\nto produce.  Plaintiffs are to answer Interrogatory 8 regarding facts of the alleged strip searches,\nand may do so generally (such as describing a typical search as well as atypical examples, as well\n9\n\nas the purported searches conducted upon the named plaintiffs).  If plaintiffs fail to produce, or if\ntheir production is unsatisfactory, the County Defendants may renew their motion.  As for\nplaintiff Tucker, plaintiff should either produce materials sought as to him or formally\nwithdraw his claim within thirty (30) days of entry of this Order.\n2. Defendant Gipson\nSeparately, defendant Gipson contends that plaintiffs have not produced any documents\nhe requested and have not answered his interrogatories (Docket No. 23).  Plaintiffs respond that\nthey will provide responses to Gipson’s demands within one week of that response (Docket\nNo. 33, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 2), stating in oral argument on September 20, 2005, that responsive\nproduction was completed.  The motion to compel is thus moot.  Again, if plaintiffs fail to\nproduce as promised (or their production is somehow incomplete or unsatisfactory), Gipson may\nrenew his motion.\n3. Sanctions\na. Motion Expenses Sanction\n“The administration of the rules lies necessarily within the province of the trial court with\npower to fashion such orders as may be deemed proper to vouchsafe full discovery for the just,\nspeedy and inexpensive determination of the lawsuit.”  Robison v. Transamerica Ins. Co.,\n368 F.2d 37, 39 (10th Cir. 1966) (Murrah, J.); see 8A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &\nRichard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2284, at 614 & n.6 (Civil 2d ed. 1994).\nRule 37 requires the movant to certify that it conferred (or attempted to confer) with the\nrecalcitrant party in good faith to secure discovery.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(2)(B); see W.D.N.Y.\nLocal Civ. R. 37.  The County Defendants allege good faith attempts to try to resolve their\n10\n\ndisclosure and discovery issues with plaintiffs’ counsel prior to this motion (Docket No. 17,\nCounty Defs. Atty. Aff. ¶¶ 53-56) which plaintiffs do not dispute.  Gipson makes general\nallegations at his attempts to confer with plaintiffs’ counsel to obtain the discovery sought\n(Docket No. 23, Gipson Atty. Aff. ¶¶ 19-20).  He does not provide specific instances of contact\nwith plaintiffs’ counsel.  A single letter from counsel, for example, has been found to not\nsufficiently satisfy the duty to confer under Rule 37.  Williams v. Board of County Comm’rs of\nUnified Gov’t of Wyandotte County & Kansas City, Kan., 192 F.R.D. 698, 699-700 (D. Kan.\n2000); see Pulsecard, Inc. v. Discover Card Servs., 168 F.R.D. 295, 302 (D. Kan. 1996); Time\nInc. v. Simpson, No. 02 Civ. 4917, 2002 WL 31844914, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2002) (denying\ncosts where movant failed to meet and confer).  In Time Inc., the court noted that the failure to\nmeet and confer forgoes the opportunity for the parties to narrow the issues before seeking court\nintervention, although the court considered the merits of plaintiff’s motion to compel.  2002 WL\n31844914, at *2. \nPlaintiffs argue that Gipson did nothing to secure his entitlement to production and that\nwhat would be produced is duplicative of materials produced to the County Defendant (Docket\nNo. 33, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 2).  But under Rule 37 even if the party produces discovery in the\nface of a motion to compel, that party remains subject to Rule 37 sanctions, see Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 37(a)(4)(A).  If a motion to compel is granted or if a party (like plaintiffs here) provides\ndisclosure after a motion to compel is filed, the court “shall” require the opposing party (and/or\ncounsel advising that party) to pay to the moving party their reasonable motion expenses, unless\nthe Court finds that the refusal to produce was substantially justified or other circumstances\nmakes an award of expenses unjust.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4)(A).\n11\n\nThe County Defendants sufficiently showed good faith efforts to resolve short of motion\npractice to warrant sanction for their motion and their motion for sanctions (Docket No. 16) is\ngranted.  Gipson in his motion (Docket No. 22), however, has not sufficiently alleged such good\nfaith efforts, merely making his motion as the other defendants did without making the effort to\nfirst request production.  As a result, Gipson will be denied recovery of his motion costs as a\nsanction.  As detailed in the Conclusion of this Order, the County Defendants are to file an\naffidavit of their reasonable costs associated with their motion (Docket No. 16) within five (5)\nbusiness days (see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) (calculation of time for less than ten day period));\nplaintiffs may file a responding affidavit within five (5) business days of service of that applying\naffidavit.  No reply papers will be accepted on the fee applications.  The Court will deem the\nmotion submitted as of the time for plaintiffs’ responding paper.\nb. Preclusion\nThe County Defendants alternatively move for evidence preclusion under Rule 37(c)(1)\nand (2) for plaintiffs’ failure to make mandatory disclosures (Docket No. 16).  The dismissal of a\nclaim, defense or preclusion of evidence for failure to respond to a discovery request is a drastic\nremedy.  Burnett v. Venturi, 903 F. Supp. 304, 309 (N.D.N.Y. 1995); see National Hockey\nLeague v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, 427 U.S. 639, 643 (1976) (per curiam) (hereinafter\n“NHL”) (dismissal as severest sanction).  Rule 37(c)(1) provides that if a party refuses to disclose\ninformation required by Rule 26(a) (unless such refusal is harmless) is not permitted to use as\nevidence at trial, at a hearing, or on a motion, any witness or information not disclosed.  “In\naddition to or in lieu of this sanction, the court, on motion and after affording an opportunity to\nbe heard, may impose other appropriate sanctions,”id., including paying reasonable motion\n12\n\nexpenses caused by the failure, sanctions authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A) (facts established), (B)\n(refusing to allow disobedient party to support claim or defense), or (C) (striking pleadings), or\ninforming the jury of the failure to disclose.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).  Subsection (2) does not\napply here, since it involves a party refusing to admit to the genuineness of a document or to the\ntruth of a requested admission under Rule 36.  Such preclusion ultimately may be dispositive and\nbeyond the authority of the undersigned to order (as opposed to recommending in a Report &\nRecommendation, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), (B).\nGipson also seeks preclusion under Rule 37(c)(1) and (2).  (Docket No. 22; Docket\nNo. 23, Def. Atty. Aff. ¶ 2.)  He seeks preclusion for plaintiffs’ failure to produce documents\n(Docket No. 23, Def. Atty. Aff. ¶ 9) or answer his Interrogatories (id. ¶ 16).  At oral argument,\nGipson joined the County Defendants in their motion regarding Rule 26 disclosure, although\ntheir motion papers only mentioned document production and interrogatories and do not state\nwhether plaintiffs produced initial disclosure to Gipson, or not, or Gipson’s efforts to request\nsuch disclosure.  \nRule 37(c) does not apply to the latter forms of discovery; as just stated it is limited to\nfailures to make initial disclosures or admissions under Rule 36 or admit to the genuineness of a\ndocument.  Rule 37(b), which authorizes evidence or issue preclusion, see Fed. R. Civ. P.\n37(b)(A), (B), (C), applies to a party’s disobedience with a Court Order to compel production of\nsome sort.  Absent such an Order, a movant is not entitled to Rule 37(b) sanctions.  See\n8A Federal Practice and Procedure, supra, § 2289, at 669; United States v. Kattar, 191 F.R.D. 33,\n35 (D.N.H. 1999) (quoting R.W. Int’l Corp. v. Welch Foods, Inc., 937 F.2d 11, 15, 16 (1st Cir.\n1991)).  Sanctions (such as recovery of motion costs) are available under Rule 37(a)(4) only if a\n13\n\nparty prevails at least in part, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4)(A), (C), or gains discovery in the face\nof the motion.\nGipson essentially seeks a sanction for failing to obey an Order to compel, Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 37(b)(2)(A)-(C), without an Order being entered.  The relief available when a party fails to\nrespond to a discovery demand is an Order to compel and sanctions of the reasonable costs\nassociated with the motion to compel, Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(2)(B), (4)(A).  The enhanced\nsanction of Rule 37(b) arises because the party disregards both the discovery demand and the\nCourt’s subsequent Order compelling production.  See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(D) (in lieu of\nforegoing order, party could be held in contempt of court for failing to obey discovery order). \nGipson’s request for relief could be construed as anticipating the breach of an Order to compel,\nbut at this stage such anticipatory relief is not available.  \nBut even if such an Order existed, rather than the extreme sanction of evidence\npreclusion, see NHL, supra, 427 U.S. at 643, the appropriate sanction here is awarding the\nsuccessful movants the limited costs for this motion.  See, e.g., Fisher v. Harris, Upham & Co.,\nInc., 61 F.R.D. 447, 451 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (reduced monetary sanction imposed rather than\nstriking answer and imposing three times greater monetary sanction), dismissed, 516 F.2d 896\n(2d Cir. 1975).   As for all defendants, evidentiary preclusion for plaintiffs’ failure to disclose\nmandatory disclosure at this stage is an extreme sanction.  While plaintiffs’ counsel may have\nbeen aware of the two witnesses defense counsel cited in oral argument, the other witnesses were\nunknown to plaintiffs (in fact, the County Defendants were in a better position to identify these\npotential witnesses, either present or former Sheriff’s Department employees, or arrestees\nprocessed at the Holding and Correctional Centers).  The better sanction, rather than preclusion,\n14\n\nis awarding of costs relative to plaintiffs’ failure to make Rule 26(a) disclosure and that portion\nof defendants’ motion seeking relief for this omission.  For failure to disclose, defendants shall\nsubmit affidavits as to their reasonable motion expenses relative only to plaintiffs’ failure (and\nnot other aspects of their motions, which were dealt with above).\nII. Plaintiffs’ Omnibus Motion\nPlaintiffs filed this omnibus motion seeking five forms of relief.  First, plaintiffs seek\nproduction of the booking sheets in order to identify possible class members and witnesses to\nstrip searches.  Second, they seek answers to their interrogatories regarding the stipulated\ndismissal of the cross-claim against defendant Gipson, contending that Gipson had admitted\nliability prior to the stipulated dismissal.  Third, plaintiffs want an order directing defendants not\nto make speaking objections during depositions.  Fourth, they seek leave to amend the Complaint\nto allege two additional plaintiff-representatives, Travis McNamara and Douglas Stanley,\nalthough the last day to amend pleadings or add parties was June 1, 2005 (see Scheduling Order,\nDocket No. 13).  Finally, fifth, plaintiffs seek enlargement of time beyond the stipulated\nextension of October 21, 2005, to give them 90 days from when defendants produce the booking\nsheets in order to make the class certification motion.  Defendants also note that plaintiffs seek in\ncamera inspection of documents noted in their privilege log; defendants argue that plaintiffs are\nnot entitled to in camera inspection of those documents (Docket No. 30, County Defs.’ Atty.\nAffirm. ¶¶ 57-66, Ex. D; cf. Docket No. 25, Pls. Atty. Aff. ¶ 16, Exs. M, N).\nGipson only objects to the extension of the deadline for filing a motion to certify the\nplaintiff class beyond the stipulated date of October 21, 2005 (Docket No. 31, Gipson Atty. Aff.\n¶¶ 2-10), while the County Defendants object to other remedies plaintiffs seek.\n15\n\nA. Plaintiffs’ Discovery Motions\n1. Compelling Production of Booking Sheets\nPlaintiffs want production of booking sheets at the Erie County Holding Center from July\n22, 2001, to the present, to identify potential class members or witnesses to instances of strip\nsearches.  They tied this production request to their ability to make an initial disclosure of\nwitnesses (Docket No. 33, Pls. Memo. at 2).  An example of the booking sheets is plaintiff\nEdward Robinson (Docket No. 25, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 13, Ex. L).  They note that the United\nStates District Court for the Northen District of New York has ordered production of these sheets\nin numerous cases.   Bruce v. County of Rensselaer, No. 02CV847, Order, Feb. 3, 2003 (Homer,\nMag. J.) (see Docket No. 25, Ex. G, hereinafter “Bruce”); Marriott v. County of Montgomery,\nNo. 03CV531, Tr. Dec. 18, 2003, at 36-37 (Peebles, Mag. J.) (see Docket No. 25, Ex. H,\nhereinafter “Marriott”); McDaniels v. County of Schenectady, No. 04CV757, Order, Jan. 10,\n2005, at 3-5 (Treece, Mag. J.) (see Docket No. 25, Ex. J), Protective Order, Jan. 11, 2005, at 2-6\n(Treece, Mag. J.) (see Docket No. 25, Ex. K, hereinafter collectively “McDaniels”); see also id.\nEx. I (argument of McDaniels motion)).\nThe County Defendants object to this production because of their relevance (or relevance\nof portions of information on the sheets) and the privacy rights of the subset of those listed on\nthese sheets who were not convicted.  Under New York Criminal Procedure Law § 160.50 arrest\nrecords (such as booking sheets) of those not convicted of an offense are to be sealed.  The\nCounty Defendants contend that the United States District Court for the Northern District of New\nYork did not consider the privacy concerns these defendants are now raising before this Court. \nThey argued in oral argument that plaintiffs had other means to seek this information and, after a\n16\n\nyear’s investigation prior to filing this action and a year’s worth of discovery, did not investigate\nshort of this drastic measure.  Under defendants’ view, if produced at all, the booking sheets\nshould be redacted to reveal information about those convicted of misdemeanors or violations,\nand not reveal information about those convicted of felonies (as irrelevant to plaintiffs’ claims)\nor all those found not guilty of any offense.  Note, defendants have not discussed the burden\nimposed by producing these records.  Plaintiffs seek information not to stigmatize arrestees\nidentified in the booking sheets, especially those arrestees who were ultimately not convicted (cf.\nDocket No. 30, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 17; Docket No. 25, Ex. H, Marriott Tr. at 14\n(plaintiffs’ counsel arguing that they do not intend to violate arrestees’ privacy rights in seeking\nthis production)) but to identify potential witnesses to strip searches and potential claimants.  \nBut the Northern District of New York did consider privacy concerns under\nCPL § 160.50, among other privacy issues raised about the interests of the arrestees discussed in\nthese records.  (See, e.g., Docket No. 25, Ex. I, McDaniels Tr. at 46-48, Ex. H, Marriott, Tr. at\n19-23 (defense arguing for prior notice to arrestees before releasing records)).  But even if that\ncourt did not consider the impact on CPL § 160.50 to the extent that the County Defendants now\ndesire, this Court has considered that provision in the arguments raised herein.  This Court has\nweighed the centrality of the information contained in these booking sheets to plaintiffs\nidentifying potential witnesses and class members with the privacy interests identified by\ndefendants under CPL § 160.50 and concludes that, with redaction as to be described, plaintiffs\nshould receive access to these records.\nTherefore, defendants are to produce redacted version of the booking sheets, either\nredacted sheets or a summary chart containing information from the sheets.  The redactions\n17\n\nshould exclude information (1) of those convicted of felonies; (2) for those whose charges were\nadjudicated but were not convicted.  Defendants do not object to redaction of these booking\nrecords being onerous  or burdensome.  Plaintiffs’ motion for production of these booking sheets\nis granted in part as follows:  information from these sheets shall be redacted or produced in\nsummary form identifying the name, address, telephone number, date of birth, arresting charge,\nand date of arrest, see Marriott, supra, Docket No. 25, Ex. H, at 36, for those arrestees who were\narrested from July 2001 to present, but excluding those arrested who (a) were ultimately not\nconvicted or (b) were convicted of felony offenses (see Docket No. 29, County Defs. Memo. at\n11).  The Court will enter a Protective Order regarding dissemination of information from these\nbooking sheets to retain confidentiality, see Marriott, supra, Docket No. 25, Ex. H, Tr. at 36-37;\nMcDaniels, supra, Docket No. 25, Ex. K.  The Court declines the County Defendants’ suggestion\nto have plaintiffs notify individuals listed in the produced redacted booking sheets (cf. Docket\nNo. 29, County Defs. Memo. at 11).\n2. Interrogatories Regarding Dismissed Gipson Cross-Claims\nThe County Defendants initially alleged a cross-claim against Gipson that \n“upon information and belief, any injuries or damages sustained by the plaintiffs\nas alleged in the Complaint, if not caused by reason of the negligence,\ncarelessness or other culpable conduct of the plaintiff, were caused or contributed\nto by the negligence, carelessness or other culpable conduct of the defendant,\nGIPSON.  Upon information and belief, some of that conduct may have occurred\noutside the scope of GIPSON’s employment.”  \n(Docket No. 3, County Defs. Ans. ¶ 32; see Docket No. 25, Pls. Atty. Aff. ¶¶ 5, 7, Ex. C). \nDefendant Gipson in his Answer asserted a parallel cross-claim against the County Defendants\n(Docket No. 4, Gipson Ans. ¶¶ 48-49).  The defendants then entered into a stipulation dismissing\n18\n\ntheir respective cross claims (Docket No. 15).  Plaintiffs now want discovery about the factual\nbasis for the cross-claim against Gipson.  They claim that Gipson sent a memorandum to his\nsubordinates which they allege admits to the existence of a blanket strip search policy prior to\nSeptember 2003 (Docket No. 25, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 5; Ex. D) and that Gipson’s deposition\ntestimony made further admissions (id. Affirm. ¶ 5).  Plaintiffs, however, did not include\nportions of Gipson’s transcript to show these admissions or paraphrase those admissions in their\nvoluminous motion papers.  The memorandum in question, dated August 27, 2003, stated that\n“routine or universal strip searches of newly admitted inmates” was found to be unconstitutional\nand effective immediately “no routine or universal strip searches are to be administered to any\nnewly admitted inmate.”  The memorandum then outlines the circumstances when such strip\nsearches could occur.  (Id. Ex. D.)\nThe County Defendants5 argue that the cross-claim was filed upon information and belief\nwithout any prior factual determination of the accuracy of plaintiffs’ underlying claim (Docket\nNo. 30, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 48).  They explain the August 27, 2003, memorandum as\npart of “a continuing effort to advise Sheriff’s Department employees of their responsibilities\nwith respect to strip searches and the fact that blanket strip searches could not be conducted.” \n(Id. ¶ 53.)  They denied the existence of blanket strip searches (id. ¶ 54).6\n5Interestingly, defendant Gipson does not comment about this portion of plaintiffs’\nmotion, cf. Docket No. 31, Def. Atty. Affirm., although during oral argument he joined in the\narguments of the County Defendants.\n6The counsel for the County Defendants make various disparaging remarks about\nplaintiffs’ contentions in this portion of his affirmation, Docket No. 30, ¶¶ 52 (“far-fetched\nallegations,” “unsubstantiated hyperbole generated regularly by the plaintiffs”), 54 (plaintiffs’\n“unilaterally spin a single memo out of context” as “typical” of their approach).  As noted at the\noutset of the Discussion in this Order, such advocate hyperbole needs to cease.\n19\n\nThe cross-claim seems to be the standard allegation among multiple defendants,\npreserving the right of the alleging defendants against a codefendant in the event plaintiff\nprevails against any of them to ensure indemnification or, in this instance, to allow the municipal\ndefendant to disclaim indemnification of one of its officials if it is later determined that the\nindividual defendant caused the injuries (see id. ¶ 49).  Therefore, plaintiffs’ motion to compel\nanswer to their interrogatories on this issue is denied.\n3. Speaking Objections and Conduct of Depositions\nPlaintiffs moved for a protective order regarding the manner of the conduct of depositions\n(Docket No. 25, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 19).  Defendants contend that they will adhere to the Rules\nalready in place regarding speaking objections (Docket No. 29, County Defs. Memo. at 14-15),\nnoting that plaintiffs’ counsel disrupted depositions (id. at 15-16; Docket No. 30, County Defs.\nAtty. Affirm. ¶¶ 67-69, Ex. E), but did not formally move for an order to sanction such conduct.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(d)(1) states that objections during an examination are\nto be “stated concisely and in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive manner.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 30(d)(1).  Cf. Hall v. Clifton Precision, 150 F.R.D. 525 (E.D. Pa. 1993).   Rule 30(d)(3)\nprovides that “if the court finds any impediment, delay, or other conduct has frustrated the fair\nexamination of the deponent, it may impose upon the person responsible an appropriate sanction,\nincluding the reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred by any parties as a result thereof.”  \n Defendants request (but have not formally cross-moved) that all counsel be admonished\nto follow the Rules (Docket No. 29, County Defs. Memo at 16).  The Court agrees; all counsel\nare reminded and admonished to follow those rules and not make suggestive objections, speaking\nobjections or other actions that would frustrate the conduct and completion of depositions, see\n20\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 30(d)(1), (d)(3); cf. 28 U.S.C. § 1927; compare DirecTV v. Rowland, Case\nNo. 04CV297, Docket No. 45 (W.D.N.Y. May 27, 2005) (Scott, Mag. J.) (sanctioning defense\ncounsel for conduct during client’s deposition).  As a result, plaintiffs’ motion is denied in part,\nsince a protective order (and its award of expenses under Rules 26(b) and 37(a)(4)) will not be\nissued, and granted in part, that all parties are reminded of their continuing obligations under\nthe Federal Rules.  As stated in the introduction to the discussion of this Order, if necessary, the\nCourt will engage in more aggressive supervision of discovery in this case, including monitoring\nof depositions.\nAs of now, neither party will be awarded sanctions for this portion of the motion.  If\nparties deviate from this particular rule, the Court may entertain a motion for sanctions or, as\nindicated previously, take a more active supervision of the completion of discovery in this case. \nBut, given the tenor of this litigation to date, the Court is not issuing an invitation for the parties\nto find reasons or create cause for further ancillary motion practice over sanctions and potentially\nsanctionable conduct.\n4. In Camera Inspection of Privilege Log Items\nPlaintiffs also seek Court review of documents identified in defendants’ privilege log to\nmake sure that they are appropriately designated as attorney-client documents (Docket No. 25,\nPls. Atty. Aff. Exs. M, N; Docket No. 30, County Defs. Atty. Affirm. Ex. D).  Defendants object\nto in camera inspection of items listed in their privilege log (Docket No. 30, County Defs. Atty.\nAffirm.).  The amended log itself (Docket No. 25, Ex. N, Docket No. 30, Ex. D) identifies\ndocuments either seeking legal advice by defendants or communication from attorneys to\ndefendants (setting up meetings or rendering legal opinions and analysis).  \n21\n\nAt argument, the County Defendants offered to submit an in camera affidavit apparently\noutlining the contents of the privilege log documents to justify the privilege asserted.  During\nargument, the Court questioned the role of the County Attorney’s office in this matter, noting its\ndual role as legal advisor and advocate in the pending action and its role as policy advisor.  The\nCourt raised concerns that the log did not sufficiently identify attorney-client communication or\nparticularize the contents of the claimed items, especially communications between the County\nAttorney’s office and the Sheriff’s Department prior to commencement of this action, given the\ndual role of advocate/advisor and policy advisor the County Attorney has.  Therefore, plaintiffs’\nmotion for in camera inspection is granted.  The Court will review the privileged log documents\nand determine if the asserted privilege appropriately applies to each of the documents.\n5. Sanctions under Rule 37\nThe prevailing party in a motion to compel is entitled to its reasonable expenses.  Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 37(a)(4).  Here, plaintiffs prevail in obtaining redacted version of the information from\ndefendants’ booking sheets and in camera inspection of the privilege log documents, but do not\nprevail in their motion for answers to their interrogatory regarding the dropped cross-claim\nagainst Gipson.  Accordingly, plaintiffs are entitled to recover some of their reasonable motion\nexpenses as to that portion of the motion to compel in which they prevailed.  Similarly,\ndefendants in successfully resisting parts of the omnibus motion to compel are entitled to their\nreasonable motion expenses.  Determining these amounts, however, should not start a cottage\nindustry of ancillary litigation. \nHere, plaintiffs sought six forms of relief, but only four of which are governed by Rule 37\nand are subject to discovery sanctions.  Since plaintiffs prevailed at two of the four forms of\n22\n\nrelief sought where discovery sanctions are available (the release of redacted information from\nthe booking sheets and in camera inspection), plaintiffs counsel should reduce any reasonable\nmotion costs either to one-third (two-sixths) of the omnibus motion’s costs or to the actual costs\nfor the prevailing portion of the motion.  Similarly, the County Defendants7 prevailed on two of\nthe four discovery sub-motions (of the six total motions for various forms of relief), their\nreasonable motion costs should be calculated either one-third of the costs to respond to the\nomnibus motion or the actual costs for arguing the prevailing objections to that omnibus motion. \nAt the schedule set forth below, the prevailing parties should submit their respective\nreasonable costs associated with the portions of plaintiffs’ motion in which they prevailed.\nB. Other Relief Sought by Plaintiffs\n1. Motion for Leave to Amend to Allow Intervention\nPlaintiffs seek to leave to have two additional representative plaintiffs, McNamara and\nStanley, two persons allegedly strip searched while in Erie County custody, intervene in this\naction as possible class representatives (Docket No. 25, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 20, 21, Exs. Q, R). \nPlaintiffs state that plaintiff Tucker may no longer be representative of the class (Docket No. 25,\nPls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 10 n.1).  Although the proposed Amended Complaint alleges instances when\nMcNamara and Stanley were arrested on petty offenses and were strip searched (id. Ex. R,\nproposed Amended Compl. ¶¶ 6, 7, 66-70, 71-74), and plaintiffs’ counsel affirms that McNamara\nwas strip searched several times during the proposed class period (id. ¶ 20), there is no separate\nsworn statement by the two proposed plaintiffs in support of their intervention in this action.\n7Defendant Gipson did not object to the production issues raised by plaintiffs in their\nomnibus motion, hence he is not entitled to recover his costs in responding to plaintiffs’ motion.\n23\n\nPlaintiffs argue that their motion to intervene is timely under Rule 24.  Defendants were\nput on notice about these possible intervenors on June 14, 2005 (id. ¶ 20, Ex. P).  Plaintiffs\nsubmitted with their motion a proposed Amended Complaint adding McNamara and Stanley as\nclaimants (id. Exs. Q, R).  Plaintiffs argue that defendants are not prejudiced by adding these\nparties.  Plaintiffs state that they learned of Stanley shortly before the deadline to add parties or\namend pleadings but knew of McNamara months beforehand.  They argue that the County\nDefendants’ delay in producing booking sheets has hindered plaintiffs from making a more\ntimely motion to intervene or for leave to amend (Docket No. 47, Pls. Reply Affirm. ¶¶ 9, 10). \nPlaintiffs do not detail when they learned of Stanley as a potential representative plaintiff.  They\ndo not explain why they failed to move to add McNamara as a plaintiff although conceding that\nthey were aware of him months before learning of Stanley.\nThe County Defendants object to the timing of request, noting that McNamara and\nStanley have not moved to intervene (Docket No. 29, County Defs. Memo. at 11-12).\nUnder the current Scheduling Order in this case (Docket No. 13), the deadline for\nmotions to join parties and to amend pleadings was June 1, 2005.  Plaintiffs provided initial\nnotice of these potential intervenors on June 14, 2005, suggested intervention on the record at the\nAugust 3, 2005, conference, and made their motion on August 10, 2005.  The County Defendants\nargue that there was no showing of good cause to justify an untimely amendment or motion for\nleave to add parties under Rule 16(b) and the Scheduling Order (Docket No. 29, at 11-12).  See\nCarnite v. Granada Hosp. Group, 175 F.R.D. 439, 446 (W.D.N.Y. 1997) (Foschio, Mag. J.)\n(Report & Recommendation), adopted, 175 F.R.D. at 441 (Arcara, J.); see also In re Milk\nProducts Antitrust Litig., 195 F.3d 430 (8th Cir. 1999).  Defendants view this request as a veiled\n24\n\nmotion for leave to amend the Complaint (see also Docket No. 25, Exs. Q, R, proposed Amended\nComplaint).  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) amendment of pleading after the time\nto do so as of right requires either consent of all parties (not present here) or by leave of the\nCourt.  Under Rule 15(a) motions for leave to amend the complaint are to be freely given when\njustice requires.  Granting such leave is within the sound discretion of the Court.  Foman v.\nDavis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321,\n330 (1971).  “In the absence of any apparent or declared reason--such as undue delay, bad faith or\ndilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments\npreviously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the\namendment, futility of amendment, etc.--the leave sought should, as the rules require, be ‘freely\ngiven.’”  Foman, supra, 371 U.S. at 182 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)).  Carnite addressed\nplaintiff’s failure to move to amend the Court’s scheduling order and his failure to raise “even [a]\nfacially persuasive reason” to grant relief.  Carnite, supra, 175 F.R.D. at 448 (Foschio, Mag. J.,\nR&R). Rule 24(b) intervention has to be timely to be granted and determining whether a motion\nto intervene is timely is within this Court’s sound discretion, United States v. Pitney Bowes,\n25 F.3d 66, 70 (2d Cir. 1994).\nHere, plaintiffs seek to have new parties intervene months after the deadline for such an\nintervention without a reasonable basis for excusing the lateness, having been aware of at least\none of them within the time for a motion to add parties or for leave to amend the Complaint. The\nfact that plaintiffs have yet to receive defendants’ booking sheets does not explain their tardiness\nin seeking leave to add these potential representative plaintiffs.  The absence of any statement\nfrom these parties themselves is also striking; aside from plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration the\n25\n\nCourt has no indication that these potential intervenors are interested in being plaintiffs, much\nless potential class representatives.  Therefore, this portion of plaintiffs’ omnibus motion is\ndenied.\n2. Enlargement of Time to Move for Class Certification\nThe parties entered into a stipulation agreeing to extend the time for a motion to certify\nthe class to October 21, 2005 (Docket No. 27), which this Court so ordered (Docket No. 28). \nMeanwhile, plaintiffs move to extend that deadline to 90 days from when defendants produce the\nbooking sheets (Docket No. 25, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 22), later stating at oral argument that the\ndeadline should start when all booking sheets were produced.  Defendants oppose this further\nextension (Docket No. 31, Gipson Atty. Affirm.; Docket No. 30, County Defs. Atty. Affirm.\n¶¶ 92-95).\nOnce plaintiffs begin to receive data from the booking sheets, they will be in a better\nposition to describe the potential class.  The time stipulated by the parties, to October 21, 2005, is\nnot adequate for plaintiffs to move to certify the class.  Therefore, this portion of their omnibus\nmotion is granted in part, but rather than set the start from when production of the booking\nsheets is complete (which is highly indefinite and, if defendants refuse to comply may delay\ncertification indefinitely), the Court will set a deadline sixty (60) days from the stipulated\nOctober 21, 2005, date, to December 20, 2005, generous enough to make the motion while not\ndependent upon the vagaries of document production.  This, however, will be the last extension\nof the class certification deadline.  Whatever plaintiffs glean from the booking sheets they\nreceive (and other discovery they obtain) should be sufficient to put together a motion to certify\ntheir proposed class.\n26\n\nIII. Ex Parte Communications with Sheriff’s Deputies\nFinally, the County Defendants complain that plaintiffs’ counsel have contacted County\nSheriff’s deputies ex parte whom defense counsel represents in this action.  The County\nDefendants seek a protective order against such contacts (Docket No. 40), citing Disciplinary\nRule 7-104(a)(1), 22 N.Y.C.R.R. § 1200.35(a)(1), and its restriction on counsel contacting\nrepresented parties in that manner, as well as the New York State Court of Appeals decision in\nNiesig v. Team I, 76 N.Y.2d 363, 559 N.Y.S.2d 493 (1990), and its definition of who is a\ncorporate “party” under DR 7-104 that opposing counsel must avoid contacting.  They argue that\nthe lieutenants and sergeants plaintiffs seek to contact are supervisory personnel and the booking\ndeputies have decision-making authority that should preclude ex parte communications (Docket\nNo. 42, County Defs. Memo. at 3).  Any admission by the deputies, sergeants or lieutenants\nwould impute liability to the defendant County, therefore they should be beyond ex parte\ncommunication (id.).  The County Defendants take the position that the booking deputies and\nthose in the booking process are also parties and are represented by the County Defendants’\ncounsel, given plaintiffs’ claim of a de facto strip search policy (id. at 4, 1) and that these\ndeputies are policy makers each time they implement the County’s intake policies (Docket\nNo. 49, County Defs. Reply Atty. Affirm. ¶¶ 3-6).  Plaintiffs reply that the sheriff’s deputies\nsought are rank and file officers who were witnesses and, under Niesig, are available for ex parte\ninterviews by plaintiffs’ counsel (Docket No. 48, Pls. Memo. at 1, citing Niesig, supra,\n76 N.Y.2d at 375, 559 N.Y.S.2d at 498-99).\nUnder Rule 26(c), the Court has power to protect against abuses in discovery.  Seattle\nTimes Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 34 (1984).  The appropriateness of a protective order is a\n27\n\nbalance of the litigation needs of the requesting party and the protect able interests of the party\nfrom whom discovery is sought.  Mitchell v. Fishbein, 227 F.R.D. 239, 245 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). \nThis Court has broad discretion in issuing such a protective order.  Seattle Times, supra, 467 U.S.\nat 36.\nA. New York Disciplinary Rule 7-104(a)(1)\nNew York State Lawyer’s Code of Professional Responsibility Disciplinary Rule 7-104\nprovides that “during the course of the representation of a client a lawyer shall not:  communicate\nor cause another to communicate on the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer\nknows to be represented by a lawyer in that matter unless the lawyer has prior consent of the\nlawyer representing such other party or is authorized by law to do so.”  DR 7-104(a)(1),\n22 N.Y.C.R.R. § 1200.35(a)(1).  The issue, then, is who is a “party” governed by this disciplinary\nrule.\nB. Scope of Disciplinary Rule\nPreliminarily, this motion raises an issue of whether the Code of Professional\nResponsibility is binding in federal Court.  Cf. Niesig, supra, 76 N.Y.2d at 369, 559 N.Y.S.2d at\n495 (Code of Professional Responsibility does not have force of law).  This Court is not bound\nby the Code of Professional Responsibility promulgated by the New York State Bar Association\n(or the Model Rules of Professional Conduct promulgated by the American Bar Association), but\nviews its ethical considerations and disciplinary rules as a source of guidance.  See Kubin v.\nMiller, 801 F. Supp. 1101, 1114 n.9 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); but cf. W.D.N.Y. Local Civ. R. 83.1(b)(6)\n(applicant attorneys agree to adhere faithfully to the Code of Professional Responsibility), (5)(G)\n(attorneys seeking admission to practice before this Court must have read and be familiar with\n28\n\nCode of Professional Responsibility as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit, and this Court).  Other federal courts in this state, which require\nadherence to the Code of Professional Responsibility, have applied DR 7-104.  See Miano v.\nAC&R Advertising, 148 F.R.D. 68, 74 75 (S.D.N.Y.) (Katz, Mag. J.), adopted, 834 F. Supp. 632\n(S.D.N.Y. 1993) (Sand, D.J.); Katt v. New York City Police Dep’t, No. 95 Civ. 8283, 1997 WL\n394593, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 14, 1997); Kennedo v. United States, No. CV-94-2252, 1995 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 21451 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 1995); see also Docket No. 42, County Defs. Memo. of\nLaw at 3, 4; Docket No. 48, Pls. Memo. of Law at 2, attachments.  The district court in Katt\nnoted that the admissibility of employee statement is broader in federal court than New York\ncourts.  Katt, supra, 1997 WL 394593, at *4 (applying Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D)).\nAs the Court of Appeals in Niesig, this Court will apply the Code of Professional\nResponsibility here “as guidelines to be applied with due regard for the broad range of interests at\nstake,” 76 N.Y.2d at 369-70, 559 N.Y.S.2d at 495.\nC. Niesig\nIn Niesig, plaintiff’s counsel sought to interview corporate defendant’s employees who\nwitnessed an accident, raising the question of which corporate employees are considered the\n“party” for DR 7-104(1)(A) purposes.  76 N.Y.2d at 367, 559 N.Y.S.2d at 494.  Plaintiff fell\nfrom a scaffolding at a construction site while employed by the corporate third-party defendant. \nPlaintiff sued and then sought to interview other employees as witnesses to the incident, id. at\n367, 559 N.Y.S.2d at 494-95.  The third-party defendant corporation resisted the ex parte\ninterviews, citing DR 7-104.  The lower courts answered that the employees were automatically\n29\n\nthe “parties” under DR 7-104 and could not be contacted ex parte by opposing counsel.  Id. at\n368, 559 N.Y.S.2d at 494.  \nThe New York Court of Appeals disagreed, holding (as to current employees) that both a\nblanket ban on employee contact or restricting contact to “control group” of officials or\nemployees do not achieve the goals of that disciplinary rule.  See id. at 371-73, 559 N.Y.S.2d at\n496-98.  The court adopted a test that a corporate “party” includes “corporate employees whose\nacts or omissions in the matter under inquiry are binding on the corporation (in effect, the\ncorporation’s ‘alter egos’) or imputed to the corporation for purposes of its liability, or\nemployees implementing the advice of counsel.  All other employees may be interviewed\ninformally.”  Id. at 374, 559 N.Y.S.2d at 498.  As noted by the court, “in practical application,\nthe test we adopt thus would prohibit direct communication by adversary counsel ‘with those\nofficials, but only those, who have the legal power to bind the corporation in the matter or who\nare responsible for implementing the advice of the corporation’s lawyer, or any member of the\norganization whose own interests are directly at stake in a representation.’” Id. at 374, 559\nN.Y.S.2d at 498 (quoting Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics, § 11.6, at 613 (Practitioners’ ed.\n1986)).  In Niesig, the Court of Appeals held that the employees that plaintiff wished to interview\nfell into the category of all other employees that may be interviewed, since they were merely\nwitnesses to the event for which the corporate defendant was sued, id. at 375, 559 N.Y.S.2d at\n498-99, allowing ex parte interviews of non-managerial employees, id. at 376, 559 N.Y.S.2d at\n499.  Judge Bellacosa, in concurring in Niesig, noted that the bar on ex parte communication\nfrom DR 7-104 also applies if the corporate employee retained counsel.  Id., at 378, 559\nN.Y.S.2d at 500-01.  \n30\n\nThe County Defendants here emphasize that defense counsel also represents the sheriff’s\nemployees that plaintiffs seek to question, having obtained waivers from their union\nrepresentation (Docket No. 42, County Defs. Memo. at 2; Docket No. 49, County Defs. Reply\nAtty. Affirm. ¶¶ 10-12, see id. ¶¶ 7-9, Exs. A, B (regarding the steps from County Attorney’s\nrepresentation to retain firm’s representation of the County Defendants)).\nD. Application\n1. Niesig\nAt issue under DR 7-104 as construed in Niesig is whether the Sheriff’s Department\nemployees plaintiffs wish to contact are alter ego policy makers for the County and County\nDefendants or whose actions can be imputed to these defendant or who can bind the County. \nThese employees currently are not parties in this action, although defense counsel for the County\nDefendants claims that it represents them.  At oral argument, the County Defendants attempted to\ndistance themselves from Niesig, distinguishing the private sector facts in that case from the\npublic sector implicated here.  The County Defendants, however, cite no authority distinguishing\nthe public as opposed to private sector for corporate parties under DR 7-104.  Niesig, in fact, was\napplied in public sector cases.  E.g., Matter of Rahn v. Town of Greece, 226 A.D.2d 1105,\n642 N.Y.S.2d 825 (4th Dep’t 1996) (town defendant cannot prohibit petitioner or his counsel\nfrom interviewing town employees who voluntarily agreed to be interviewed); Quintana v. City\nof N.Y., 259 A.D.2d 296, 689 N.Y.S.2d 408, 409 (1st Dep’t 1999) (not improper under DR 7-\n104 for plaintiff’s investigator to interview superintendent, low-level official in defendant’s\nagency).\n31\n\nThus, there is a fact issue as to the role of the deputies plaintiffs intend to contact and\nwhether they are policy makers or alter egos for the County.  Do the deputies that conduct inmate\nintake or conduct a strip search (or those who witnesses such conduct) bind the County?  The\nCounty Defendants’ position is akin to the blanket ban on contact of all employees rejected by\nthe Court of Appeals in Niesig, merely by arguing that all employees plaintiffs wish to interview\nare “policymakers” and that their decisions in processing arrestees and inmates constitutes policy\nmaking.  The line deputies that plaintiffs seek to interview certainly make decisions (such as how\nto conduct processing of arrestees, whether to search them and to what extent) but that does not\nmake them “policymakers” that bind the County Defendants by their decisions.  Defense counsel\nis not arguing that these deputies were acting upon the advice of counsel (be it theirs or the\nCounty Attorney’s office).\nAs a result, the actual rank and file Sheriff’s Department officers who conducted searches\nare not policy makers and, under Niesig and DR 7-104, should be available for plaintiffs to\nconduct ex parte interviews.  The officers, absent a subpoena, are free to decline to speak with\nplaintiffs’ counsel or condition the interviews as the officers see fit; in turn, plaintiffs counsel\nmay seek to depose these employees or seek subpoenas to examine them.  \nOfficers at the rank of sergeant or lieutenant and above, however, have administrative and\nmanagement functions that could be policymaking imputed to the County or the Sheriff (such as\ndirecting certain actions be undertaken that could be construed as County policy).  These officers\nshould not be contacted ex parte by plaintiffs.  Again, this does not preclude any contact by\nplaintiffs with sergeants or lieutenants or higher ranking sheriff’s department officers and\n32\n\nofficials; it merely requires plaintiffs to seek interviews on notice and coordination with defense\ncounsel, or by deposition upon notice or subpoena.\n2. Claimed Representation of Individual Employees\nThe fact that the County Defendants’ counsel claims to represent these non-parties is not\nmaterial.  The defense and indemnification provisions of state and local law, N.Y. Pub. Off. Law\n§ 18; Erie County Charter § 602 (see Docket No. 49, County Defs. Atty. Reply Affirm. Ex. A),\nonly apply if the public employee is sued or is otherwise made a party in the action.  DR 7-104\nprohibits communication with a “party” known to be represented by counsel on that matter; here,\nthe rank and file deputies are not “parties” or known to be represented on this case, save defense\ncounsel’s declaration and union acquiescence.  This differs from the result in Pauling v.\nDepartment of the Interior, 964 F. Supp. 117, 118-19 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (cf. Docket No. 42,\nCounty Defs. Memo. at 4), where the court sanctioned plaintiff from ex parte communication\nwith a government employee that plaintiff’s counsel knew (and conceded) was represented by the\ngovernment’s attorney.  While the deputies’ union in this case may have authorized the County\nAttorney and his retained outside counsel to represent the deputies in this action, each deputy\ncould have declined that representation (cf. Docket No. 48, Pls. Atty. Affirm. ¶ 4, Ex. C, current\nemployee “told” that defense firm would represent her and she was denied option of retaining her\nown counsel).  Further, since these deputies are not parties, the only possible notice to plaintiffs\nthat these employees were represented is the statements by defense counsel leading to this motion\nfor a protective order.  See also McHugh v. Fitzgerald, 280 A.D.2d 771, 773, 719 N.Y.S.2d 785,\n786-87 (3d Dep’t 2001) (prohibition in DR 7-104 does not apply before representation begins\nand adversary must be aware of representation in order to have prohibition take effect).\n33\n\nHence, the County Defendants’ motion is granted in part as to Sheriff’s Department\nemployees at the rank of sergeant or higher, but denied in part as to lower ranking Sheriff’s\nDepartment employees.\nE. Reasonable Expenses\nUnder Rule 26(c), if a protective order is granted at least in part, the Court applies\nRule 37(a)(4) standards to determine if sanctions are warranted.  Under the latter rule, if a motion\nis granted in part and denied in part, the court may, after affording an opportunity to be heard,\napportion the reasonable expenses to the motion among the parties and persons in a just manner. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4)(C).  Included in the argument of these motions was discussion of the\nreasonable costs for this motion.  The Court finds that each party should bear its own costs for\nthis motion.  See Payne v. Howard, 75 F.R.D. 465, 472 (D.D.C. 1977) (neither side took position\nso unjustified as to warrant imposition of costs, ordering each party to bear its own costs).\nIV. Source of Sanctions\nThe discussion above indicated instances when sanctions should be paid either for having\na prevailing discovery motion or having successfully resisting such motions.  The next issue is\nwho has to pay this sanction, the clients or counsel.  Courts have imposed discovery sanctions\nagainst attorneys for their conduct that lead to discovery motions, see 8A Federal Practice &\nProcedure, supra, § 2288, at 662 & n.23, including against government attorneys, see, e.g., U.S.\nv. Sumitoma Marine & Fire Ins., 617 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir. 1980).  As noted at the beginning of the\nDiscussion in this Order, counsel have proceeded with rancor and vitriol in the conduct of this\ncase, in particular in the conduct of discovery and the motion practice surrounding discovery. \nThere is no indication that this was done at the express urging of the clients.  The three named\n34\n\nplaintiffs and the taxpayers of Erie County should not bear the results of the unreasonable and\nvexatious conduct, cf. 28 U.S.C. § 1927, to date of their counsel.  Therefore, counsel shall be\nresponsible for any sanction imposed by this Court and shall not pass this costs to their clients.\n(cid:105) (cid:105) (cid:105) (cid:105)\nThis Order ends as it began.  Parties are reminded that the Court will no longer\ncountenance the acrimony and bitterness in which pretrial matters have been handled.  The\nsniping, sparring, and gamesmanship8 must stop.  If it persists, however, the Court may resort to\nvarious devices under the Rules and within its inherent supervisory authority to control the\nconduct of the parties and counsel in this case, for example micro management of discovery or\nsanctions under Rules 11, 16(f), 37, and 28 U.S.C. § 1927 for unreasonable and vexatious\nconduct by counsel.  This case needs to get to its merits and not dwell on arguments for the sake\nof vexatious litigation.  Continuing down the current path of this action will inevitably lead to\nfurther delays, added expense, and ultimately justice denied.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, defendants County of Erie, Gallivan, Howard, Livingston,\nand Huggins’ (the “County Defendants”) joint motion to compel (Docket No. 16) is granted in\npart, as modified, and with costs; defendant Gipson’s motion to compel (Docket No. 22) also is\ngranted, with some costs, as described in detail above.  In particular, plaintiffs either are to\nproduce discovery responses as to plaintiff Julenne Tucker or formally withdraw Tucker’s\nclaims within thirty (30) days of entry of this Order.\n8Or, as succinctly and colorfully described at oral argument, “the crap.”\n35\n\nThe County Defendants’ motion for a protective order (Docket No. 40) is granted in\npart, denied in part as described above, without costs to any party, cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c),\n37(a)(4)(C).\nPlaintiffs’ motion for various forms of relief (Docket No. 25) is granted in part as\ndescribed in detail above (namely production of booking sheets and ordering in camera\ninspection of defendants’ privilege log documents, and extending time beyond the stipulated\ndeadline for a motion for class certification, as described more fully above) and denied in part\n(namely interrogatory answers regarding the former cross-claim against defendant Gipson, an\norder of protection regarding the conduct of depositions; leave to amend the Complaint to add\ntwo additional plaintiffs).  Plaintiffs have until December 20, 2005, in which to file their class\ncertification motion; this is the final extension of the class certification deadline.\nAs for the reasonable discovery motion costs sanctions associated with the prevailing\nparties to these several motions, the prevailing parties (as identified above and as limited above)\nare to file and exchange affidavits of their respective reasonable motion costs within five (5)\nbusiness days from entry of this Order; the opposing parties then may file a response within five\n(5) business days of service of that affidavit.  No reply papers will be accepted on the fee\napplications.  The Court then will deemed the fee applications submitted as of the latter date and\nwill issue an Order awarding costs. Once determined, such sanctions shall be paid by the\nrespective counsel responsible for the expense.\nSo Ordered.\n                       s/HBS                \nHon. Hugh B. Scott\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n36\n\nDated: Buffalo, New York\nSeptember 26, 2005\n37",

Rozger, Beranbaum Menken Ben-Asher &\nBiermam LLP, New York, NY, for Plaintiffs-Respondents.\nBefore JACOBS, Chief Judge, CARDAMONE and MINER, Circuit Judges.\nDENNIS JACOBS, Chief Judge.\nIn the course of a lawsuit by a class of arrested persons against Erie County (and certain of its officials) alleging\nthat they were subjected to unconstitutional strip searches, the United States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of New York (Curtin, J.) ordered the discovery of e-mails (and other documents) between an Assistant\nErie County Attorney and County officials that solicit, contain and discuss advice from attorney to client. The\nCounty defendants petition for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to vacate that order. The writ is\navailable because: important issues of first impression are raised; the privilege will be irreversibly lost if review\nawaits final judgment; and immediate resolution of this dispute will promote sound discovery practices and\ndoctrine. Upon consideration of the circumstances, we issue the writ ordering the district court: to vacate its order,\nto determine whether the privilege was otherwise waived, and to enter an interim order to protect the\nconfidentiality of the disputed communications.\nI\n416 On July 21, 2004, plaintiffs-respondents Adam Pritchard, Edward Robinson and *416 Julenne Tucker\ncommenced suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, individually and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated,\nalleging that, pursuant to a written policy of the Erie County Sheriff's Office and promulgated by County officials,\nevery detainee who entered the Erie County Holding Center or Erie County Correctional Facility (including\nplaintiffs) was subjected to an invasive strip search, without regard to individualized suspicion or the offense\n[1]\nalleged, and that this policy violates the Fourth Amendment.  They sued the County of Erie, New York, as well\nas Erie County Sheriff Patrick Gallivan; Undersheriff Timothy Howard; the acting Superintendent of the Erie\n\nCounty Correctional Facility, Donald Livingston; the Deputy Superintendent, Robert Huggins; and the\nSuperintendent of the Erie County Holding Center, H. McCarthy Gibson (collectively, the \"County\").\nDuring the course of discovery, the County withheld production of certain documents as privileged attorney-client\ncommunications; a privilege log was produced instead, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and\nLocal Civil Rules for the Western District of New York. In August 2005, plaintiffs moved to compel production of\nthe logged documents, almost all of which were e-mails. The County submitted the documents to Magistrate\nJudge Hugh B. Scott for inspection in camera. In January 2006, Judge Scott ordered production of ten of the\n[2]\nwithheld e-mails,  which (variously) reviewed the law concerning strip searches of detainees, assessed the\nCounty's current search policy, recommended alternative policies, and monitored the implementation of these\npolicy changes.\nJudge Scott reasoned that:\n00 These communications \"go beyond rendering `legal analysis' [by] propos[ing] changes to\n95\nexisting policy to make it constitutional, including drafting of policy regulations\";\n00 The \"drafting and subsequent oversight of implementation of the new strip search policy\n95\nventured beyond merely rendering legal advice and analysis into the realm of policy making and\nadministration\"; and\n00 \"[N]o legal advice is rendered apart from policy recommendations.\"\n95\nJudge Scott ordered the County to deliver these ten e-mails to the plaintiffs.\nAfter considering the County's objections to this order, the district court independently reviewed the disputed e-\nmails in camera and, applying a \"clearly erroneous\" standard, overruled the objections, and directed production.\nThis petition for a writ of mandamus followed.\nII\nOrdinarily, pretrial discovery orders involving a claim of privilege are unreviewable on interlocutory appeal, \"and\nwe have expressed reluctance to circumvent this salutary rule by use of mandamus.\" In re W.R. Grace & Co.,\n984 F.2d 587, 589 (2d Cir.1993). At the same time, the writ is appropriate to review discovery orders that\npotentially invade a privilege, where: (A) the petition raises an important issue of first impression; (B) the privilege\n417 will be lost if review must await final judgment; and (C) immediate resolution *417 will avoid the development of\ndiscovery practices or doctrine that undermine the privilege. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. Turner & Newall\nPLC, 964 F.2d 159, 163 (2d Cir.1992); In re Long Island Lighting Co., 129 F.3d 268, 270 (2d Cir. 1997). (Although\nthe County argues that any single showing is enough, the test sprouts three prongs; in any event, the County\nprevails on all three.)\n(A) This petition raises an issue of first impression: whether the attorney-client privilege protects communications\nthat pass between a government lawyer having no policymaking authority and a public official, where those\n[3]\ncommunications assess the legality of a policy and propose alternative policies in that light.  The issue is not\nunimportant.\n\"[T]here is little case law addressing the application of the attorney-client privilege\" in the government context. In\nre Grand Jury Investigation, 399 F.3d 527, 530 (2d Cir.2005); see also Ross v. City of Memphis, 423 F.3d 596,\n601 (6th Cir.2005) (same). The issue of first impression here concerns policy advice rendered by a government\nlawyer, and the distinction between (on the one hand) attorney-client privileged recommendations designed to\nachieve compliance with the law or reduce legal risk, and (on the other) recommendations made for other\n[4]\nreasons, which advice may not be privileged.\n(B) Post-judgment relief would be inadequate to protect the privilege, if it exists; this consideration \"justifies the\nmore liberal use of mandamus in the context of privilege issues.\" In re Long Island Lighting Co., 129 F.3d at 271; \nsee also In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d 94, 99 (2d Cir. 1987).\n\nA motions panel of this Court denied the County's motion for a stay pending appeal, so the communications at\nissue are already in plaintiffs' hands. Plaintiffs argue that the dispute is now moot because \"the risks associated\nwith the development of discovery practices . . . undermining the privilege . . . have already been realized.\"\nIssuing the writ \"cannot unsay the confidential information that has been revealed.\" In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d at\n99. In the circumstances presented, the privilege can nevertheless be vindicated by preventing the use of the\ndocuments during further discovery (including, for example, in depositions, interrogatories, document requests\nand pretrial motions) and at trial.\n(C) To await resolution of this issue pending final judgment risks the development of discovery practices and\ndoctrine that unsettle and undermine the governmental attorney-client privilege. See Chase Manhattan, 964 F.2d\n418 at 164. To \"encourage full and frank communication *418 between attorneys and their clients,\" Upjohn Co. v.\nUnited States, 449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981), lawyers and clients need to know which\nof their communications are protected. \"An uncertain privilege . . . is little better than no privilege.\" In re von\nBulow, 828 F.2d at 100. The \"potentially broad applicability and influence of the privilege ruling\" weighs heavily in\nfavor of adjudicating the dispute now. In re Long Island Lighting Co., 129 F.3d at 271.\nIII\nThe attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between client and counsel made for the\npurpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance. United States v. Const. Prod. Research, Inc., 73 F.3d 464, 473\n(2d Cir.1996). Its purpose is to encourage attorneys and their clients to communicate fully and frankly and\nthereby to promote \"broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.\" Upjohn, 449\nU.S. at 389, 101 S.Ct. 677; see also In re John Doe, Inc., 13 F.3d 633, 635-36 (2d Cir.1994). \"The availability of\nsound legal advice inures to the benefit not only of the client who wishes to know his options and responsibilities\nin given circumstances, but also of the public which is entitled to compliance with the ever growing and\nincreasingly complex body of public law.\" In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Sept. 15, 1983, 731\nF.2d 1032, 1036-37 (2d Cir.1984).\nAt the same time, we construe the privilege narrowly because it renders relevant information undiscoverable; we\napply it \"only where necessary to achieve its purpose.\" Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403, 96 S.Ct. 1569,\n48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976); see In re Grand Jury Investigation, 399 F.3d at 531. The burden of establishing the\napplicability of the privilege rests with the party invoking it. In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d 175, 182 (2d\nCir.2000); United States v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of Am., AFL-CIO,\n119 F.3d 210, 214 (2d Cir.1997).\nIn civil suits between private litigants and government agencies, the attorney-client privilege protects most\nconfidential communications between government counsel and their clients that are made for the purpose of\n[5]\nobtaining or providing legal assistance. In re Grand Jury Investigation, 399 F.3d at 532; see, e.g., Ross v. City\nof Memphis, 423 F.3d 596, 601 (6th Cir.2005) (\"[A] government entity can assert attorney-client privilege in the\ncivil context.\"); In re Lindsey, 148 F.3d 1100, 1107 (D.C.Cir.1998) (per curiam) (noting the existence of \"a\ngovernment attorney-client privilege that is rather absolute in civil litigation\"); cf. Proposed Fed. R.Evid. 503(a)(1),\nreprinted in 56 F.R.D. 183, 235 (1972) (describing a client, for the purpose of defining the attorney-client privilege,\nas a \"person, public officer, or corporation, association, or other organization or entity, either public or private\")\n(emphasis added).\n419 The attorney-client privilege accommodates competing values; the competition is *419 sharpened when the\nprivilege is asserted by a government. On the one hand, non-disclosure impinges on open and accessible\ngovernment. See Reed v. Baxter, 134 F.3d 351, 356-57 (6th Cir.1998). On the other hand, public officials are\nduty-bound to understand and respect constitutional, judicial and statutory limitations on their authority; thus, their\naccess to candid legal advice directly and significantly serves the public interest:\nWe believe that, if anything, the traditional rationale for the [attorney-client] privilege applies with\nspecial force in the government context. It is crucial that government officials, who are expected to\nuphold and execute the law and who may face criminal prosecution for failing to do so, be\n\nencouraged to seek out and receive fully informed legal advice. Upholding the privilege furthers a\nculture in which consultation with government lawyers is accepted as a normal, desirable, and\neven indispensable part of conducting public business. Abrogating the privilege undermines that\nculture and thereby impairs the public interest.\nIn re Grand Jury Investigation, 399 F.3d at 534. Access to legal advice by officials responsible for formulating,\nimplementing and monitoring governmental policy is fundamental to \"promot[ing] broader public interests in the\nobservance of law and administration of justice,\" Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 389, 101 S.Ct. 677. At least in civil litigation\nbetween a government agency and private litigants, the government's claim to the protections of the attorney-\nclient privilege is on a par with the claim of an individual or a corporate entity.\nIV\nA party invoking the attorney-client privilege must show (1) a communication between client and counsel that (2)\nwas intended to be and was in fact kept confidential, and (3) was made for the purpose of obtaining or providing\nlegal advice. Const. Prod. Research, Inc., 73 F.3d at 473. At issue here is the third consideration: whether the\ncommunications were made for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice, as opposed to advice on\n[6]\npolicy.\nThe rule that a confidential communication between client and counsel is privileged only if it is generated for the\npurpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance is often recited. The issue usually arises in the context of\ncommunications to and from corporate in-house lawyers who also serve as business executives. See, e.g., MSF\nHolding, Ltd. v. Fiduciary Trust Co. Int'l, No. 03 Civ. 1818, 2005 WL 3338510, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2005); Bank\nBrussels Lambert v. Credit Lyonnais (Suisse), 220 F.Supp.2d 283, 286 (S.D.N.Y.2002); U.S. Postal Serv. v.\nPhelps Dodge Refining Corp., 852 F.Supp. 156, 160 (E.D.N.Y.1994). So the question usually is whether the\ncommunication was generated for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice as opposed to business\nadvice. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Sept. 15, 1983, 731 F.2d at 1036-37.\nFundamentally, legal advice involves the interpretation and application of legal principles to guide future conduct\nor to assess past conduct. See generally 1 Paul R. Rice, Attorney Client Privilege in the United States § 7:9 (2d\ned.1999). It requires a lawyer to rely on legal education and experience to inform judgment. Ball v. U.S. Fid. &\n420 Guar. Co., No. M8-85, 1989 *420 WL 135903, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.8, 1989) (reasoning that legal advice \"involve\n[s] the judgment of a lawyer in his capacity as a lawyer\"). But it is broader, and is not demarcated by a bright line.\nWhat Judge Wyzanski observed long ago applies with equal force today:\nThe modern lawyer almost invariably advises his client upon not only what is permissible but also\nwhat is desirable. And it is in the . . . public interest that the lawyer should regard himself as more\nthan [a] predicter of legal consequences. His duty to society as well as to his client involves many\nrelevant social, economic, political and philosophical considerations. And the privilege of\nnondisclosure is not lost merely because relevant nonlegal considerations are expressly stated in\na communication which also includes legal advice.\nUnited States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 89 F.Supp. 357, 359 (D.Mass.1950). We consider whether the\npredominant purpose of the communication is to render or solicit legal advice. United States v. Int'l Bus. Machs.\nCorp., 66 F.R.D. 206, 212 (S.D.N.Y. 1974); see also In re Buspirone Antitrust Litig., 211 F.R.D. 249, 252-53\n(S.D.N.Y. 2002) (employing the \"primary purpose\" standard in assessing whether the attorney-client privilege\nprotects certain documents); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, No. M-11-198, 2001 WL 1167497, at *25 (S.D.N.Y.\nOct.3, 2001) (same); Armstrong v. Brookdale Hosp., No. 98 Civ. 2416, 1999 WL 690149, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 28,\n[7]\n1999) (same); U.S. Postal Serv., 852 F.Supp. at 163 (applying a \"dominant purpose\" standard).\nThe complete lawyer may well promote and reinforce the legal advice given, weigh it, and lay out its ramifications\nby explaining: how the advice is feasible and can be implemented; the legal downsides, risks and costs of taking\nthe advice or doing otherwise; what alternatives exist to present measures or the measures advised; what other\npersons are doing or thinking about the matter; or the collateral benefits, risks or costs in terms of expense,\npolitics, insurance, commerce, morals, and appearances. So long as the predominant purpose of the\n\ncommunication is legal advice, these considerations and caveats are not other than legal advice or severable\nfrom it. The predominant purpose of a communication cannot be ascertained by quantification or classification of\none passage or another; it should be assessed dynamically and in light of the advice being sought or rendered,\n421 as well as the *421 relationship between advice that can be rendered only by consulting the legal authorities and\n[8]\nadvice that can be given by a non-lawyer.  The more careful the lawyer, the more likely it is that the legal advice\nwill entail follow-through by facilitation, encouragement and monitoring.\nV\nThe County asserts that the Assistant County Attorney whose advice was solicited could not have been\nconveying non-legal policy advice because the Erie County Charter (§ 602) confines her authority to that of a\n\"legal advisor,\" and because \"only the County Sheriff and his direct appointees ha[ve] policy-making authority for\nthe [Sheriff's] department.\" This argument does not assist the analysis much. A lawyer's lack of formal authority to\nformulate, approve or enact policy does not actually prevent the rendering of policy advice to officials who do\npossess that authority. A similar consideration may be useful in different circumstances. When an attorney is\nconsulted in a capacity other than as a lawyer, as (for example) a policy advisor, media expert, business\nconsultant, banker, referee or friend, that consultation is not privileged. In re Lindsey, 148 F.3d at 1106 (citing 1\nMcCormick on Evidence § 88, at 322-24 (4th ed.1992); Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers § 122\n[9]\n(Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 1996)).  In the government context, one court considered relevant the fact that the\nattorney seeking to invoke the privilege held two formal positions: Assistant to the President (ostensibly non-\nlegal) and Deputy White House Counsel (ostensibly legal). In re Lindsey, 148 F.3d at 1103, 1106-07. The same is\ntrue in the private sector where \"in-house attorneys are more likely to mix legal and business functions.\" Bank\nBrussels Lambert, 220 F.Supp.2d at 286; accord Hercules, Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 434 F.Supp. 136, 147\n(D.Del.1977). In short, an attorney's dual legal and non-legal responsibilities may bear on whether a particular\ncommunication was generated for the purpose of soliciting or rendering legal advice; but here, the Assistant\nCounty Attorney's lack of formal policymaking authority is not a compelling circumstance.\nThe predominant purpose of a particular document00legal advice, or not00may also be informed by the overall\n97 97\nneeds and objectives that animate the client's request for advice. For example, Erie County's objective was to\nascertain its obligations under the Fourth Amendment and how those requirements may be fulfilled, rather than to\nsave money or please the electorate (even though these latter objectives would not be beyond the lawyer's\nconsideration).\nVI\nAfter reviewing in camera the documents listed on the County's privilege log, Judge Scott determined that the ten\n422 e-mails at issue here are not privileged. These e-mails, dated between December *422 23, 2002 and December\n11, 2003, passed between the Assistant County Attorney and various officials in the Sheriff's Office (primarily\npetitioners). The ten e-mails are an amalgam of the following six broad issues:\n(i) The compliance of the County's search policy with the Fourth Amendment (EC-C-0014, EC-\nC-0060, EC-C-00119, EC-C-00126 and EC-C-00161);\n(ii) Any possible liability of the County and its officials stemming from the existing policy (EC-\nC-0014, EC-C-0060, EC-C-00119 and EC-C-00126);\n(iii) Alternative search policies, including the availability of equipment to assist in conducting\nsearches that comply with constitutional requirements (EC-C-14, EC-C-0060, EC-C-00108, EC-\nC-00119, EC-C-00126, EC-C-00161-79, EC-C-00180 and EC-C-00227);\n(iv) Guidance for implementing and funding these alternative policies (EC-C-14, EC-C-0060, EC-\nC-00119, EC-C-00126, EC-C-00161, EC-C-00180, EC-C-204-20 and EC-C-00227);\n(v) Maintenance of records concerning the original search policy (EC-C-00225); and\n\n(vi) Evaluations of the County's progress implementing the alternative search policy (EC-\n[10]\nC-00204-20 and EC-C-00223-25).\nThe judge reasoned (inter alia) that because these e-mails \"propose[d] changes to existing policy to make it\nconstitutional\" and provided guidance \"to executive officials within the Sheriff's Department to take steps to\nimplement the new policy . . . no legal advice is rendered or rendered apart from policy recommendations.\"\nBecause the e-mails \"go beyond rendering legal analysis,\" the judge concluded that they were not privileged. We\ndisagree.\nIt is to be hoped that legal considerations will play a role in governmental policymaking. When a lawyer has been\nasked to assess compliance with a legal obligation, the lawyer's recommendation of a policy that complies (or\nbetter complies) with the legal obligation00or that advocates and promotes compliance, or oversees\n97\nimplementation of compliance measures00is legal advice. Public officials who craft policies that may directly\n97\nimplicate the legal rights or responsibilities of the public should be \"encouraged to seek out and receive fully\ninformed legal advice\" in the course of formulating such policies. In re Grand Jury Investigation, 399 F.3d at 534.\nTo repeat: \"The availability of sound legal advice inures to the benefit not only of the client . . . but also of the\npublic which is entitled to compliance with the ever growing and increasingly complex body of public law.\" In re\nGrand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Sept. 15, 1983, 731 F.2d at 1036-37. This observation has added\nforce when the legal advice is sought by officials responsible for law enforcement and corrections policies.\nWe conclude that each of the ten disputed e-mails was sent for the predominant purpose of soliciting or rendering\nlegal advice. They convey to the public officials responsible for formulating, implementing and monitoring Erie\nCounty's corrections policies, a lawyer's assessment of Fourth Amendment requirements, and provide guidance\n423 in crafting and implementing alternative *423 policies for compliance. This advice 00 particularly when viewed in\n97\nthe context in which it was solicited and rendered-does not constitute \"general policy or political advice\"\nunprotected by the privilege. In re Lindsey, 148 F.3d at 1120 (Tatel, J., dissenting).\nAlthough the e-mails at issue were generated for the predominant purpose of legal advice, we remand for the\ndistrict court to determine whether the distribution of some of the disputed e-mail communications to others within\nthe Erie County Sheriff's Department constituted a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. Cf. In re Horowitz, 482\nF.2d 72, 81-82 (2d Cir.1973); see also United States v. DeFonte, 441 F.3d 92, 94-95 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).\nConclusion\nThe writ of mandamus is granted; the district court's April 17, 2006 order is vacated; the district court is instructed\nto determine whether the attorney-client privilege was nonetheless waived; pending adjudication, the district court\nis directed to enter an order protecting the confidentiality of the disputed e-mails.\n[1] We intimate no view as to the underlying merits.\n[2] Certain of these e-mails are better characterized as e-mail chains, because they contain the initial e-mail as\nwell as subsequent responses. Because the chains concern the subject of the original e-mail, for simplicity's\nsake, we use the term \"e-mail\" to encompass the entire e-mail \"conversation.\"\n[3] The parties have not raised the applicability of the deliberative process privilege. See Nat'l Council of La Raza\nv. Dep't of Justice, 411 F.3d 350, 356 (2d Cir.2005) (\"[T]he deliberative process privilege [is] a sub-species of\nwork-product privilege that covers documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\" (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n[4] Respondents assert that this issue is not novel and that it was raised in Mobil Oil Corp. v. Dep't of Energy, 102\nF.R.D. 1 (N.D.N.Y. 1983). Mobil Oil is useful; but it applies the familiar requirement that a factual communication\nsent to an attorney is protected by the attorney-client privilege only if the communication was generated for the\npurpose of securing legal assistance. Id. at 9-10. Because in that case it was \"impossible to determine\" whether\n\ncertain factual memoranda were sent to government lawyers primarily for the purpose of securing legal\nassistance, the government did not discharge its burden to prove that the privilege applied. Id.\n[5] Certain limitations to the government attorney-client privilege, not implicated here, may render an otherwise\nprotectable communication unprotected.

However, because the\nCourt held that the corporation had waived the privilege (and because there was cause to believe that the crime-\nfraud exception applied), the issue was not further considered.

For the past several years, the Erie County\nSheriff’s Departmem has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who emer either\nthe Erie County Holding Center and/or the Erie County Correctional Facility, regardless\n\nof the crime upon which they are charged. Upon information and belief, this policy is, in\npart, derived from the written procedures of the Erie County Sheriff’s Department, and\nwas promulgated by senior Department officials; specifically, Defendants Sheriff Patrick\nGallivan, Undersheriff Timothy Howard, Acting Superintendent Daniel J. Livingston,\nDeputy Superintendent Robert Huggins, and Superintendent H. McCarthy Gibson.\nIt has been welt established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals\ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized\nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband. In short, the policy of Erie County\nand the Erie County Sheriff’s Department to force those charged with minor crimes to\nundergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Erie County Holding Center\nand/or the Erie County Correctional Facility is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive\nand unnecessary.\nAdam Pritehard, Edward Robinson, and Julenne Tucker bring this action on\nbehalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class ot\" thousands of others who were strip\nsearched after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary\nviolation of their civil rights and those of the class members they propose to represent.\nAll three of these individuals were charged with misdemeanor and/or violation offenses,\nand all were subject to strip searches, in violation of their right against unreasonable\nsearches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. They seek\nmonetary damages for themselves and each member of the proposed class, a declaration\nthat the Sheriff’s Department’s policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding\nErie County and the Erie County Sheriff’s Department from continuing to violate the\n2\n\nrights of those .placed into their custody. With this as a background, Plaintiffs Adam\nPritchard, Edward Robinson~ and Julenne Tucker complain as follows:\nJURISIJlCTION\n1. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the previsions of 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive\ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state taw, of the rights\nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983. This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the\nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government.\n2. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise\nto Plaintiffs’ claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial\ndistrict.\nPARTIES\nPlaintiff Adam Pritchard (\"Pritchard\") is 37 years old and resides in Erie\nCounty. Pritchard was arrested on or about May 13, 2003 and placed into the Erie\nCounty Correctional Facility on a Violation of Parole for leaving Erie County without\nauthorization and using a cell phone.

Mr. Pritchard\nwas on parole after being convicted of the crime of Attempted Assault in the Second\nDegree, a Class E Non-Violent Felony offense.\n\n4. Plaintiff Edward Robinson (\"Robinson\") is 20 years old and resides in Erie\nCounty, New York. Robinson was arrested on or about May 14, 2004 and transported to\nthe Erie County Holding Center on charges of failing to pay a fme related to a traffic\ninfraction (driving with a suspended license). Upon information and belief, Mr.\nRobinson was held in the Erie County Holding Center on one additional occasion during\nthe class period.\n5. Plaintiff Julenne Tucker (\"Tucker\") is 33 years old and resides in Cook\nCounty, Illinois. On or about June 1, 2004, Tucker was arrested and placed in the Erie\nCounty Holding Center on charges Trespassing in the First Degree (a class A\nmisdemeanor).\n6.

Collectively, Sheriff Gallivan, Undersheriff Howard, Superintendent\nLivingston, Deputy Superintendent Huggins and Superintendent Gibson will be referred\nto as the \"Policy Making Defendants.’\"\n7\n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n14. Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated\nindividuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip\nsearched upon their entry into the Erie County Holding Center and the Erie County\nCorrectional Facility.\n15. The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows:\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the Erie\nCounty Correctional Faeitity and/or the Erie County Holding Center after\nbeing charged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or\nparole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and\nwere or will be strip .searched upon their entry into the Erie County\nCorrectional Facility and/or the Erie County Holding Center pursuant to\nthe policy, custom and practice of the Erie County Sheriff’s Departmerrt\nand the County of Erie. The class period commences on July 22, 200t and\nextends to the date on which the Erie County Sheriff’ s .Department and/or\nthe County of Erie are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their\nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip searches\nabsent reasonable suspicion. Specifically excluded from the class are\nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal\nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.\n16. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action\nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy\nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).\n17. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.\nUpon information and beliet~ there are thousands of people arrested for misdemeanors\nand violations who are placed into the custody of the Erie County Correctional Facility\nand/or the Erie County Holding Center every month - all of whom are members of the\nproposed class. Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed class totals at least\n8\n\n20,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple\noccasions.\n18. Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is\nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class\nmembers are tikely dispersed over a large geographical area, with some members\npresently residing outside of Erie County and this Judicial District. Furthermore, upon\ninformation and belie1; many members of the class are low-income persons, may not\nspeak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually.\nt9. Common questions of law and fact exist as to atl members of the Class, in that\nthey all had their right to be free t~om unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’\nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion. A11 members of the class were\ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Erie\nCounty Correctional Facility and/or the Erie County Hotding Center, and all were\nillegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established law in this judicial circuit.\n20. Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.\nPlaintiffs and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’\ncourse of conduct. The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered\nby the class members.\n21. The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the\noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.\nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class.\n22. Plaintiffs have retained counsel who has sub~antial experience and success in\nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights iitigatiorL The named Plaintiffs are being\n9\n\nrepresented by Elmer Robert Keach, III; Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger of Berenbaum\nMenken & Ben-Asher, LLP; Gary E. Mason and Charles Schneider of The Mason Law\nFirm, PLLC; and Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuea of Cuneo Waldman & Gilbert,\nLLP. Mr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who has litigated\na wide variety of civil rights actions in federal courts, and has litigated class action\nlawsuits in state and federal courts in five states. Mr. Keach has successfully litigated\nstrip search cases against the Troy City Police Department, the Rensselaer County\nSheriff’s Department and the Schenectady City School District, and is lead counsel in\nseveral strip search class actions pending before the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of New York.\n23. Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger are both experienced civil rights attorneys\nfrom New York City, having litigated scores of civil rights cases against a number of\nDefendants, including one prison brutality case presemly pending in this District. Mr.\nMenken and Mr. Rozger have successfully represented many victims of iltegal strip\nsearches, including several who opted out of the recent class action litigation against the\nCity of New York. Mr. Menken and Mr. Rozger have both served as co-counsel in\nsimilar class action litigation pending before the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of New York.\n24. Gary E. Mason is one of this cotmtry’s premier class action attorneys, with\noffices in Washington, DC. Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against\nFortune 500 companies in both state and federal court in over a dozen jurisdictions,\nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of\n$ 950 million dollars. Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high\n\nprofile class actions, including In Re The Exxon Valdez, In Re Diet Drugs Product\nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation~ In\naddition to his extensive experience as a class action and environmental lawyer, Charles\nSchneider is a former trial attorney with the U.S, Department of Justice’s Civil Rights\nDivision and has successfully litigated a series of cases.involving corrections misconduct.\nMr. Mason and Mr. Schneider have both served as co-counsel in similar class action\nlitigation pending before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York.\n25. Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuea ofCuneo Waldman & Gilbert, LLP have\nextensive experience before state and federal trial arid appellate courts, before law\nenforcement authorities and in proceedings before the United States Congress. Cuneo\nand LaDuca have successfully prosecuted several complex class actions, including cases\ninvolving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer protection and products liability\nin state and federal courts throughout the United States. Mr. Cuneo and Mr. LaDuca\nhave both served as co-counsel in a similar class action pending before the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern Distrief of New York.\n26. In short, Plaintiffs\" counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to\nsuccessfully prosecute this action against ErCieounty, the Erie County Sheriff’s\nDepartment and the Policy Making DefendantsC. ounsel for Plaintiffs knows of no\nconflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class.\n27. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, the\nPlaintiffs’ seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members\nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged\nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Erie County Jail.\nI1\n\nIn short, the County of Erie, the Erie County Sheriffs Department, the Policy Making\nDefendants and Erie County Corrections Officers acted on grounds generally applicable\nto all class members.\n28. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative,\nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).\n29. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and\npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class. These\ncommon questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and\npredominate question of whether the Defendants\" written and/or de facto policy of strip\nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to\nthe ECCF and/or the ECHC is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe United States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed\nduring the class period.\n30. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the\nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are\ndispersed over a large geographical area. Furthermore, the expense and burden of\nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the\nclass to redress the wrongs done to them. The cost to the federal court system of\nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous. Individualized litigation\nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system. By\ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer\n12\n\nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and\nprotects the rights of each member of the Class.\n31. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the\nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though\nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the past\nseveral years, with the practice being declared unconstitutional in this judicial circuit in\n1986.\n32. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also\nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).\n1.3\n\n¯\nFACTS\nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally\n33. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state\nofficials, such as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections\nOfficers they supervise, from performing strip searches of arrestees who have been\ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes unless the officer has reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is coneealing a weapon or contmband.\n34. Upon information and belief, the County of Erie, the Erie County Sheriff’s\nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto\npolicy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the\nECCF and/or the ECHC, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the\npresence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon\nor contraband.\n35. Upon information and belief, the County of Erie, the Erie County Sheriff’s\nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto\npolicy, custom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of\nthe vaginal and reetaI cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the ECCF\nand/or the ECHC, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their\ncharged crime. For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are\ncollectively referred to as \"strip searches.\"\n36. The County of Erie, the Erie County Sheriff’s Department, and the Policy\nMaking Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a\npolicy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable\n14\n\nsuspicion. This judicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may not strip\nsearch individuals charged with misdemeanors or violations absent particularized,\nreasonable suspicion, with this principle being clearly established in 1986 by Weber v.\nDell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986).\n37, The Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom\nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been\npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established\nlaw.\n38. Upon information and belief, not only is the policy of strip searching illegal,\nbut the manner in which individuals are searched is also impermissible. For example,\nupon information and belief, individuals are strip searched in the presence of corrections\nofficers, jail employees and/or other arrestees, some of whom are of the opposite gender.\n39. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the\nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged,\nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances oft he arrest.\n40. Upon information and belief, the County of Erie, the Erie County Sherift\" s\nDepartment and the Individual Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced,\nand/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip\nsearching all individuals placed into the custody of the Erie County Jail without any\nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort. This written and/or\nde facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature\nof the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a\n\nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of\nroutine strip searches.\n41. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class,\nincluding every named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry\ninto the ECCF and/or the ECHC. These searches were conducted without inquiry into or\nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable\nsuspicion. Strip searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among other\ninnocuous offenses, traffic violations and Trespassing.\n42. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted\npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches -\neach member of the class, including every named Plaintiff- has suffered or will suffer\npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs\nA. Julenne Tucker\n43. Mr. Tucker’s experience is representative. On or about June 1, 2004, Mr.\nTucker was charged with Criminal Trespassing in the First Degree, a Class A\nmisdemeanor. Mr. Tucker subsequently resolved these Charges by pleading guilty to\nCriminal Trespassing in the Second Degree, a Class B Misdemeanor, and received 17\ndays incarceration as a penalty (time served to the date of his first appearance). Mr.\nTucker is presently 33 years old.He was taken into custody by the Town of Hamburg\nPolice Department.\n44. At approximately 1:30 PM on or about June 2, 2004, Mr. Tucker was\ntransported to the Erie County Holding Center on $250.00 bail. Approximately three\n16\n\nhours later, Mr. Tucker was moved into a homing cell in the intake area of the HoMing\nCenter and ordered to remove his clothingA. s Corrections Officers watched, Mr. Tucker\nremoved his clothing.\n45. A Corrections Officer then instructed MriTucker to turn his back to them,\nsquat and spread the lobes of his buttocks to allow for a visual inspection of his rectum.\nMr. Tucker was subsequently instructed to lift his feet, turn around and ii_ft his testicles.\nAfter a Corrections Officer later inspected his mouth and hair, Tucker was provided with\na jail uniform.\n46. This search was conducted in the presence of three other detainees, who were\nalso being strip searched at the same time as Mr. Tucker. Three Corrections Officers\nwere present during this search, and were themselves searching other detainees.\n47. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that\nMr. Tucker was concealing a weapon or other contraband. Indeed, no inquiry was made\nof Mr. Tucker that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. Moreover,\nbecause Mr. Tucker had already been in the custody of police officers from the Town of\nHamburg, the Corrections Officers in question knew or should have known that Mr.\nTucker had already been subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed\nany weapons or contraband.\n48. Mr. Tucker has three previous felony convictions, and k likely that he could\nbe arrested again and placed in the custody of the Erie County Sheriff.\n49. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted\npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Tucker has\nI7\n\nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental\nanguisl~\nB. Edward Robinson\n50. Mr. Robinson’s experience is representative as well. On or about May 14,\n2004, Mr. Robinson was arrested on a bench warrant, the basis for the warrant being that\nhe had failed to pay a $200.00 fine assessed after a conviction for driving on a suspended\nlicense (a traffic infraction). Mr. Robinson subsequently resolved the bench warrant by\nserving four days in the Erie County Holding Center. Mr. Robinson is presently 20 years\nold. Mr. Robinson was taken into custody by the Town of Lackawanna Police\nDepartment.\n51. At approximately 12i00 PM on May 15, 2004, Mr. Robinson was transported\nto the Erie County Holding Center. Approximately 5 minutes alter arriving, Mr.\nRobinson was moved into a room in the intake area and told to face \"the eyes\" on the\nwall, He was then instructed to remove all of his clothing. As a Corrections Officer\nwatched, Mr. Robinson removed his clothing with the exception of his underpants. Mr.\nRobinson was then instructed to pull the waist band of his undershorts forward,\nwhereupon the Corrections Officer inserted a gloved hand into Robinson’s underpants\nand physically examined his groin, including the sides of his testicles. Mr. Robinson was\nthen instructed to lower his underpants, bend over and \"spread your cheeks.\" Mr.\nRobinson complied, and the Corrections Officer then conducted a visual inspection of\nMr. Robinson’s rectal cavity.\n52. Mr. Robinson then put his street clothes back on, and was moved to a holding\narea known as \"’the bullpen.\"\n18\n\n53. This initial search was conducted in the presence of his transporting officer\n~om the Town of Lackawanna and a female Corrections Officer, both of whom had a\nclear view of the area where Mr. Robinson was searched.\n54. Several hours later, Mr. Robinson was strip searched again upon receiving his\njail uniform.\n55. Upon information and belief, Mr. Robinson was admitted to the Ere County\nHolding Center on another occasion during the class period, and was also subjected to a\nstrip search at that time.\n56. There was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Robinson was\nconcealing a weapon or other contraband. Indexxl, no inquiry was made of Mr. Robinson\nthat could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.\n57. As a direct and proximate result of this unlawfifl strip search conducted\npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Robinson\nhas suffered and cominues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental\nanguish.\nC. Adam Pritchard\n58. Mr. Pritchard’s experience is represemative as well. On or about May 13,\n2003, Mr. Pritchard was charged with violating the conditions of his parole - namely, he\nwas violated for leaving Erie County without permission and for using a cell phone in\ncontradiction to the conditions of his parole. Mr. Pritehard was taken into custody by a\nNew York State Parole Officer.\n59. At approximately 4:00 PM on the day of his arrest, Mr. Pritehardwas\ntransported to the Ere County Correctional Facility. Soon thereafter, Mr. Pritchard was\n19\n\nmoved into a small room in the intake area where a Corrections Officer sat at a desk. At\nthe time of Mr. Pritchard’s admission, there were two Corrections Officers and three\ndetainees (\"intake workers\") present in the small room. The Corrections Officer\ninstructed Mr. Pritchard to remove each piece of his clothing separately while Pritchard\nstood in front of him, including Pritchard’s underpants. The room where the search was\nperformed is in plain view of the chairs utilized for intake of new detainees, and is also in\nplain view of the facility control room where female Corrections Officers are sometimes\nassigned.\n60. The Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Prichard to \"lift\" his testicles,\nthen. litt his penis separately from his testicles. Pritchard then was instructed to turn\naround, place his hands against the wall, and lifi his feet. He was then required bend at\nthe waist and spread the lobes of his buttocks to allow the Corrections Officer to visually\nexamine his rectum. Pritchard then was required to open his mouth for an inspection, and\nsubsequently received the jail uniform.\n61. Without stating or implying that Mr. Pritchard is a habitual criminal, Mr.\nPritchard has been arrested on a number of occasions in the past. Consequently, there is a\npossibility beyond mere speculation that he will be rearrested in the future, making it\nlikely that he will again be subjected to the same illegal search procedure.\n62. There was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Pritchard was\nconcealing a weapon or other contraband. Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Pritchard\nthat could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. Moreover, because Mr.\nPritchard had already been in the custody of a Parole Officer of the New York State\nDivision of Parole, the Corrections Officer in question knew or should have known that\n2O\n\nMr. Pritehard had already been subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have\nrevealed any weapons or comraband.\n63. As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted\npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Pritchard\nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental\nanguish.\n21\n\nCAUSES OF ACTION\nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law\n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid\nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law --\n64. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation\nstated in paragraphs 1 through 63.\n65. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens\nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from\nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent\nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or\nweapons.\n66. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the\nUnited States Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Erie County\nCorrections Officers to strip search Plaintiffs and class members based on their arrests for\nmisdemeanor/violation charges. It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy\nMaking Defendants to order/direct Erie County Corrections Officers to conduct such\nsearches.\n67. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice\nof the County of Erie and the Erie County Sheriffs Department. As such, the County of\nErie is directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of the Class.\n68. Upon information and belie£ Sheriff Gallivan, Undersheriff Howard,\nSuperintendent Livingston, Deputy Superintendent Huggins and Superintendent Gibson\nare responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to he utilized in the operation\n\nof the Erie County Correctional Facility and the Erie County Holding Center, and are\nresponsible for the implementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.\nAs such, Gatlivan, Howard, Livingston, Huggins and Gibson are each individually\nresponsible for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of the Class.\n69. Sheriff Galtivan, Undersheriff Howard, Superintendent Livingston, Dept~ty\nSuperintendent Huggins, and Superintendent Gibson knew that the ECCF and ECHC’s\nstrip search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to\ndeprive Plaintiffs and members of the Class of their Constitutional rights.\n70. This conduct on the part ofalI Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law.\n71. As a direct and proximate result of the uneonstitutional acts described above,\nPlaintiffs have been irreparably injured.\n23\n\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n72. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation\nstated in paragraphs 1 through 71.\n73. The policy, custom and practice of the Erie County SherifFs Department, the\nCounty of Erie and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional in that these\nentities and individuals are dkecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals\nplaced into the ECCF and/or the ECHC vckhout any particularized suspicion that the\nindividuals in question have either contraband or weapons. . .\n74. Plaintiffs and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory\njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Erie and the Erie\nCounty Sheriff s Department to be UlmOnstitutional.\nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSL OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n75. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation\nstated in paragraphs 1 through 74.\n76. The policy, custom and practice of the Erie County Sheriff’s Department, the\nCounty of Erie and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that these\nentities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals\nplaced into the ECCF and/or the ECHC without any particularized suspicion that the\nindividuals in question have either contraband or weapons.\n\n77. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the ECCF and\nthe ECHC, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the\nharms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs.\n78. The cominuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor\ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class,\nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law.\n79. Plaintiffs demand that the County of Eriteh,e Erie CountySheriff’s\nDepartment, the Policy Making Defendants and Erie County CorrectioOnfsficers\nimmediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of the ECCF\nand/or the ECHC absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have\neither contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction\nfrom this Court ordering as much.\n25¯\n\n... DEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n80. The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in\nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a\nfact that their actions are unconstitutional.\nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY\n81. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nW$tEREFORE, Plaimiffs Adam Pritchard, Edward Robinson and Julenne Tucker,\non behalf of themselves and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated, request that\nthis Honorable Court grant them the following relief:\nA.       An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Cir. P. 23.\nB.       A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs\" First\nand Fourth Causes of Action detailed herein, awarding Compensatory Damages to each\nnamed Plaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by\na Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis.\nC. A judgment against Defendant Patrick Gallivan on Plaintiffs’ First Cause of\nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages.\nD. A judgmem against Defendant Timothy Howard on PIaimiffs’ First Cause of\nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages.\nE. A judgment against Defendant Donald J.

A judgment against Defendant H. McCarthy Gibson on Plaintiffs’ Fh-st Cause\nof Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages.\nH. A declaratory judgment against all Defendants deelaring the County of Erie\nand the Erie County Sheriff’s Department’s policy, .practice and custom of strip and\nvisual cavity searching all detainees entering the ECCF and/or the ECHC, regardless of\nthe crime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper.\nI. A preliminary and permanem injunction enjoining Defendants from\ncontinuing to strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or\nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the\nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband.\nJ.

      "text": "Case 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 294   Filed 05/23/12   Page 1 of 3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n \n____________________________________ \n            : \nADAM PRITCHARD and       : \nEDWARD ROBINSON, both individually  : \nand on behalf of a certified class of    : \nsimilarly situated individuals,     : \n            : \n      Plaintiffs,    : \n            : \n  v.          :   No. 04-CV-0534 (RJA/HBS) \n            : \nTHE COUNTY OF ERIE, et. al.,     : \n            : \n      Defendants.    : \n___________________________________ : \n \nPLAINTIFF’S SUBMISSION REGARDING PROCEDURAL POSTURE OF PRESENT \nACTION \n \n  The Court instructed the parties to provide a joint submission regarding the procedural \nposture of this action, and to try and reach agreement regarding what motions should be filed.  \nThe  Plaintiffs  have  been  unable  to  reach  an  agreement  in  this  regard,  their  best  efforts \nnotwithstanding.    In  their  letter  to  Plaintiffs’  counsel  representing  their  effort  to  “confer,” \nattached hereto as Exhibit A, and in their submission to the Court, the Defendants maintain that it \nis they, rather than the Plaintiffs, that should be able to dictate the terms by which the Court \nconsiders their conduct in this action.  The Defendants also, by claiming that the Plaintiffs are \nengaging “in a blatant attempt to avoid the implications of the Florence decision,” ignore the \ndifferences in their admissions procedures compared to the limited factual scenario addressed by \nthe United States Supreme Court.  Florence does not provide corrections officials with carte \nblanche to do as they please, and other Federal courts have ruled that group strip searches violate \nthe constitutional rights of pre-trial detainees.  The Defendants essentially propose that the Court \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 294   Filed 05/23/12   Page 2 of 3\nshould  not  consider  the  totality  of  their  conduct,  including  their  admitted  procedure  of \nconducting group strip searches, but should instead give the Plaintiffs no ability to raise this \nissue.     \n  The Plaintiffs have acknowledged the impact of the Florence decision on the strip search \nclaims raised in this litigation, and do not plan to burden the Court’s time contesting that the bulk \nof the allegations raised by the Class have been disposed of by this binding precedent.  Instead, \nthe Plaintiffs will present the Court with one concise legal issue:  Can corrections officials, in the \nabsence of any justification, conduct humiliating group strip and visual cavity searches of pre-\ntrial detainees.  The Plaintiffs propose that the easiest way to raise this issue would be for them \nto be provided with leave to file an amended complaint, which would include revised class \ndefinitions, detailing their claims of group strip searches at both the Erie County Holding Center \nand the Erie County Correctional Facility.  (See, Exhibit B, Email from Keach to Domagalski).  \nThe Defendants could then file a Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c) motion regarding this amended \ncomplaint, which would squarely address the legal issue detailed above.  Should the Court grant \nthe Defendants’ motion, that would obviate the need for decertification of the class or a factually \ncomplicated motion for summary judgment.  Should the Court deny the Defendants’ motion, \nthan this litigation can proceed accordingly.   \n  This is exactly the procedure to which class counsel has agreed in other strip search \nlitigation, including a state wide class action against the State of West Virginia.  This procedure \nwill  efficiently  address  the  central  issue  remaining  in  this  litigation  absent  the  need  for  a \nvoluminous,  and  contested,  summary  judgment  motion  addressing  thousands  of  pages  of \ndeposition transcripts and other documents, or feuding over potentially tangential issues such as \ndecertification or continuing discovery.  The Plaintiffs request that the Court enter a schedule \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 294   Filed 05/23/12   Page 3 of 3\nallowing for the Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, and then detailing a briefing schedule \nfor the Defendants to file a motion against that complaint.       \n            Respectfully Submitted By: \n            /s Elmer Robert Keach, III \n                 __________________________________ \nDated: May 23, 2012       Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire \n            LAW OFFICES OF ELMER ROBERT \n               KEACH, III, PC \n            1040 Riverfront Center \n            P.

McCARTHY GIBSON, both individually  \nand as Superintendent of the Erie County Holding Center,2 \n \n      Defendants. \n_________________________________________ \n \nDEDRICK WILLIAMS, MARQUESSA PAGE, and \nCAMILE SMITH, individually and on behalf of a certified \nclass of others similarly situated, \n \n      Plaintiffs,            06-CV-291-A \n                   DECISION AND ORDER \n    v. \n \nTHE COUNTY OF NIAGARA; THOMAS BEILEIN, both \nindividually and in his official capacity as Sheriff of the  \nCounty of Niagara; SAMUEL MUSCARELLA, both  \nindividually and as Undersheriff of the County of Niagara;  \nand JOHN SAXTON, both individually and as Major in  \nthe Niagara County Sherriff’s Office, \n                                            \n1  Julenne Tucker was a Plaintiff in the Erie action when the case was filed.  The Court, however, granted \ncounsel’s motion to withdraw from representing Plaintiff Tucker, and the Court also declined to make \nPlaintiff Tucker a class representative.  See Docket No. 264 at 1 n.1.  In addition, this case was brought on \nbehalf of a putative class that the Court eventually certified.  For the reasons discussed below, the Court \ndecertifies the class.  Thus, the only Plaintiffs who remain in case 04-CV-534-A are Adam Pritchard and \nEdward Robinson, and both proceed only on their own behalf.   \n \n2  Each of the individual Defendant’s successors-in-office “is automatically substituted as a party” for all \nofficial-capacity claims against the individual Defendants.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). \n1 \n \n\n \n      Defendants.  \n_________________________________________ \n \n  These class actions challenge alleged policies in Erie County and Niagara County \nrequiring strip searches of detainees held in the Erie County Holding Center (ECHC), the \nErie County Correctional Facility (ECCF), and the Niagara County Jail (NCJ).  The \nPlaintiffs in both cases allege that Erie County and Niagara County, together with the \nindividual Defendants—high-ranking officials in each County’s Sheriff’s Office—maintain \npolicies requiring that all new detainees at the ECHC, the ECCF, and the NCJ be strip-\nsearched,  regardless of  the  crime  with  which  the detainee  has been  charged, and \nregardless of whether reasonable suspicion exists to believe the detainee has contraband \non his or her person.3  The Court eventually certified classes in both cases.   \nThe Plaintiffs’ claims in both cases are significantly impacted by the Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, \n566 U.S. 318 (2012), which was decided during the pendency of these cases.  In light of \nFlorence, the Erie Plaintiffs acknowledge that their claims are no longer viable.  They \ntherefore seek to amend their complaint.  In the alternative, the Erie Plaintiffs seek to \ndecertify the class and to voluntarily dismiss their case.  The Erie Defendants oppose \neach of these motions.  Instead, the Erie Defendants seek summary judgment.  In the \nNiagara action, both parties have moved for partial summary judgment, and the Plaintiffs \nhave moved to amend.   \n                                            \n3  The Erie action and the Niagara action are brought on behalf of different plaintiffs and are different in \nseveral material respects.  Both cases, however, have been brought and defended by the same counsel; \nboth cases raise identical procedural issues; and both cases turn on the same Fourth Amendment \nprinciples.  The Court therefore addresses both cases together in this Decision and Order.  When \nnecessary, the parties in either case will be identified as the Erie Plaintiffs, the Erie Defendants, the Niagara \nPlaintiffs, or the Niagara Defendants. \n2 \n \n\nFor the reasons stated below, the Court denies the Erie Plaintiffs’ motion to amend; \ndecertifies the Erie class; denies the Erie Plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss this case; \nand grants the Erie Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  In addition, the Court \nconcludes  that  Niagara  Plaintiff  Dedrick  Williams  is  no  longer  an  adequate  class \nrepresentative; modifies the definition of the Niagara class to exclude detainees who were \narrested as part of an unusual mass arrest on March 11, 2005; and defers ruling on the \nNiagara Plaintiffs’ motion to amend and the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.  \nThe Court will decide those motions once the parties address whether the Niagara class \nmembers should receive notice of their membership in the class.    \nDISCUSSION \nA. Legal standards \na.  The standard for summary judgment \nThe summary judgment standard is well settled.  A party is entitled to summary \njudgment if the party shows “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and \nthe [party] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  A fact is \n“material” if it “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  And a dispute over a material fact is \n“genuine” if “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the \nnonmoving party.”  Id.  Thus, a court’s role in deciding a summary judgment motion is “not \n. . . to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether \nthere is a genuine issue for trial.”  Id. at 249.  When considering a summary judgment \nmotion, “[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences \nare to be drawn in his favor.”  Id. at 255.   \n3 \n \n\nWhen a party seeks summary judgment on a constitutional challenge to a prison \npolicy—where, as discussed below, the law mandates a degree of deference to the \njudgment of prison officials—a court “must distinguish between evidence of disputed facts \nand disputed matters of professional judgment.  In respect to the latter, [a court’s] \ninferences must accord deference to the views of prison authorities.”  Beard v. Banks, \n548 U.S. 521, 530 (2006).  “Unless a prisoner can point to sufficient evidence regarding \nsuch issues of judgment to allow him to prevail on the merits, he cannot prevail at the \nsummary judgment stage.”  Id.   \nb.  Standards for individual and municipal liability under § 1983 \nBoth the Erie Plaintiffs and the Niagara Plaintiffs bring their claims under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983.  None of the Plaintiffs brings a claim against the sheriff’s deputies who allegedly \nstrip-searched  them.    Instead,  each  set  of  Plaintiffs  brings  their  claims  against, \nrespectively, Erie and Niagara Counties, and against the supervisory officials in charge \nof the ECHC, the ECCF, and the NCJ.  The Plaintiffs allege that the individual Defendants \nare responsible for implementing or enforcing unconstitutional strip-search policies.  See \nErie Docket No. 1 ¶ 13 (referring to individual Defendants as “Policy Making Defendants”); \nNiagara Docket No. 1 ¶ 9 (same).  The standards for individual and municipal liability \nunder § 1983 are different, and the Court therefore briefly addresses each standard. \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n\n1.  Individual-capacity liability4  \n“In order to establish individual liability under § 1983, a plaintiff must show (a) that \nthe defendant is a ‘person’ acting ‘under the color of state law,’ and (b) that the defendant \ncaused the plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right.”  Back v. Hastings on Hudson Union \nFree School Dist., 365 F.3d 107, 122 (2d Cir. 2004).5  Section 1983 does not allow \ngovernment  officials  to  “be  held  liable  for  the  unconstitutional  conduct  of  their \nsubordinates under a theory of respondeat superior.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n676 (2009).  Instead, “[t]o establish a section 1983 claim” against a government official in \nhis  individual  capacity,  “‘a  plaintiff  must  establish  a  given  defendant’s  personal \ninvolvement in the claimed violation.’”  Warren v. Pataki, 823 F.3d 125, 136 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(quoting Patterson v. Cnty. of Oneida, N.Y., 375 F.3d 206, 229 (2d Cir. 2004)).  “A plaintiff \nmay establish such personal involvement by making any one of five showings . . .:  \n(1) the defendant participated directly in the alleged constitutional violation, (2) the \ndefendant, after being informed of the violation through a report or appeal, failed \nto remedy the wrong, (3) the defendant created a policy or custom under which \nunconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed the continuation of such a policy or \ncustom, (4) the defendant was grossly negligent in supervising subordinates who \ncommitted the wrongful acts, or (5) the defendant exhibited deliberate indifference \nto  the  rights  of  [the  plaintiffs]  by  failing  to  act  on  information  indicating  that \nunconstitutional acts were occurring. \n                                            \n4  Each of the individual Defendants is sued in both his official and individual capacities.  “[A] § 1983 suit \nagainst a municipal officer in his official capacity is treated as an action against the municipality itself.”  Coon \nv. Town of Springfield, Vt., 404 F.3d 683, 687 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Brandon v. Holt, 469 U.S. 464, 471-73 \n(1985)).  See also Baines v. Masiello, 288 F. Supp. 2d 376, 384 (W.D.N.Y. 2003) (“[A] suit against a \nmunicipal officer in his or her official capacity is functionally equivalent to a suit against the entity of which \nthe officer is an agent.  Therefore, . . . it would be redundant to allow the suit to proceed against the City of \nBuffalo and the individual city officials in their official capacity.”) (citations omitted).  None of the individual \nDefendants moved to dismiss the official-capacity claims against them, but because those claims are \nduplicative of claims against Erie and Niagara Counties, they are, in effect, merged into the municipal-\nliability claims.  Thus, the Court need not consider the Plaintiffs’ official-capacity claims separately from the \nPlaintiffs’ municipal-liability claims. \n \n5  There is no question whether the Defendants in both cases are “person[s]” acting “under color of state \nlaw” within the meaning of § 1983.   \n \n5 \n \n\n \nId. (quoting Colon v. Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 873 (2d Cir. 1995)).6 \n2.  Municipal liability  \n  The principles governing liability for Erie and Niagara Counties are somewhat \ndifferent  than  the  principles  governing  liability  for  the  individual  Defendants.    “A \nmunicipality may be liable under § 1983 only ‘if the governmental body itself ‘subjects’ a \nperson  to  a  deprivation  of  rights  or  ‘causes’  a  person  ‘to  be  subjected’  to  such \ndeprivation.’”  Cash v. Cnty. of Erie, 654 F.3d 324, 333 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Connick v. \nThompson, 563 U.S. 51, 60 (2011) and Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 692 \n(1978)).  A municipality, in other words, “cannot be held ‘vicariously liable under § 1983 \nfor [its] employees’ actions.’”  Id. (quoting Connick, 563 U.S. at 60) (quotation marks \nomitted).  Rather, “to establish municipal liability under § 1983, a plaintiff must prove that \n‘action pursuant to official municipal policy’ caused the alleged constitutional injury.”  Id. \n(quoting Connick, 563 U.S. at 60).   \nc.  The Fourth Amendment as applied to prison strip searches \nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures.”  As its \ntext makes clear, “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness.’”  \nBrigham City, Utah v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 403 (2006).  “The test of reasonableness \nunder  the  Fourth  Amendment,”  however,  “is  not  capable  of  precise  definition  or \nmechanical application,” and, “[i]n each case it requires a balancing of the need for the \n                                            \n6  The Second Circuit has repeatedly declined to consider what impact, if any, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662 (2009), had on the Second Circuit’s decision in Colon.  See, e.g., Shaw v. Prindle, 661 F. App’x 16, 18 \nn.2 (2d Cir. 2016).  Because neither party raises the issue, the Court assumes that Colon remains an \naccurate statement of the law in the Second Circuit. \n6 \n \n\nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.”  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979).7   \nThe context in which a Fourth Amendment “search” occurs helps inform the \nsearch’s reasonableness.  As a general matter, a court considering a Fourth Amendment \nclaim must “consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.”  Id.  \nSearches  of  the  sort  at  issue  in  these  cases  present  two  often  countervailing \nconsiderations: Detention facilities are “unique place[s] fraught with serious security \ndangers,” id., but, at the same time, it is difficult to “underestimate the degree to which \n[such] searches may invade the personal privacy of inmates.”  Id. at 560.  Balancing those \nconsiderations can be difficult, because while “inmates do not enjoy the full range of \nconstitutional rights possessed by unincarcerated individuals, the Fourth Amendment still \nrequires that searches—even those in the prison context—be reasonable.”  Hodges v. \nStanley, 712 F.2d 34, 35 (2d Cir. 1983) (citing Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285 \n(1948)).   \nThese principles underlie the Supreme Court’s decision in Florence v. Board of \nChosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, 566 U.S. 318 (2012).  Florence involved \na challenge to a jail policy requiring “strip searches” of all detainees, regardless of the \nseriousness of the detainee’s alleged offense, and regardless of whether any reason \nexisted to suspect that the detainee posed a danger or might be smuggling contraband.8  \n                                            \n7  Of course, subject to several “specific exception[s],” Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 2482 (2014), \n“reasonableness generally requires the obtaining of a judicial warrant.”  Veronia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, \n515 U.S. 646, 653 (1995).  No Plaintiff has suggested that a warrant is required for a non-contact prison \nstrip search. \n \n8  The Court noted that the term “strip search” “is imprecise.”  Id. at 325.  For instance, the term “may refer \nsimply to the instruction to remove clothing while an officer observes from a distance of, say, five feet or \n7 \n \n\nThe plaintiff in Florence was arrested based on a warrant that was later found to be \ninvalid.  After his arrest, the plaintiff was taken to a county detention center, where he was \nheld for six days; he was then taken to a county correctional facility, after which he was \nreleased.  Regulations at the first facility “required every arrestee to shower with a \ndelousing agent,” and “[o]fficers would check arrestees for scars, marks, gang tattoos, \nand contraband as they disrobed.”  Id. at 323.  The plaintiff “claim[ed] he was also \ninstructed to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and lift his \ngenitals.”  Id. \nThe second facility to which the plaintiff was taken had similar requirements.  “[A]ll \narriving detainees passed through a metal detector and waited in a group holding cell for \na more thorough search.”  Id. at 324.  “When they left the holding cell, they were instructed \nto  remove  their  clothing  while  an  officer  looked  for  body  markings,  wounds,  and \ncontraband.  Apparently without touching the detainees, an officer looked at their ears, \nnose, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits, and other body openings.”  Id.  The \nPlaintiff also “allege[d] [that] he was required to lift his genitals, turn around, and cough in \na squatting position as part of the process.”  Id.  The plaintiff was then required to shower, \nafter which he was allowed to enter the facility.  Id.  No corrections officer at either facility \ntouched any part of the plaintiff’s unclothed body.  Id. at 325.   \nFlorence’s  analysis  began  by  recognizing  the  “establish[ed]”  principle  that \n“correctional officers must be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect \n                                            \nmore; it may mean a visual inspection from a closer, more uncomfortable distance; it may include directing \ndetainees to shake their heads or to run their hands through their hair to dislodge what might be hidden \nthere; or it may involve instructions to raise arms, to display foot insteps, to expose the back of the ears, to \nmove or spread the buttocks or genital areas, or to cough in a squatting position.”  Id. As used in Florence, \nhowever, the term “strip search” did “not include any touching of unclothed areas by the inspecting officer.”  \nId. \n8 \n \n\nand deter the possession of contraband in their facilities.”  Id. at 328.  Moreover, the Court \nobserved, “[t]he task of determining whether a policy is reasonably related to legitimate \nsecurity  interests  is  ‘peculiarly  within  the  province  and  professional  expertise  of \ncorrections officials.’”  Id. (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 548).  Thus, the bottom-line rule from \nthe Court’s prison-search cases is that “deference must be given to the officials in charge \nof a jail unless there is ‘substantial evidence’ demonstrating their response to the situation \nis exaggerated.”  Id. at 330 (quoting Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 584-85 (1984)). \nIn light of these principles, the Court rejected the plaintiff’s argument that “more \ninvasive search procedures” were unconstitutional as applied to detainees who were held \nfor  less-serious  offenses,  and  for  whom  there  was  no  “reasonable  suspicion  of  a \nconcealed weapon or other contraband.”  Id.  The Court began by observing that “[t]he \nadmission of inmates creates numerous risks for facility staff, for the existing detainee \npopulation, and for a new detainee himself or herself.”  Id.  These risks include the \nintroduction of lice or contagious infections, the risk “posed by the increasing number of \ngang members who go through the intake process,” and the “most serious responsibility” \nof  “[d]etecting  contraband  concealed  by  new  detainees.”   Id. at  331-32.    Providing \nanecdotal evidence of the problem of prison contraband—even from the most benign \nitems, such as chewing gun or a pen case9—and observing that it “often takes little time \nand effort” to conceal contraband, the Court concluded that “[i]t is not surprising that \ncorrectional officials have sought to perform thorough searches at intake.”  Id. at 333. \n                                            \n9  “Chewing gum can block locking devices,” while “an overlooked pen case can pose a significant danger”: \n“Inmates commit more than 10,000 assaults on correctional staff every year and many more among \nthemselves.”  Id. at 332-33 (quotation marks omitted). \n9 \n \n\nWith  these  considerations  in  mind,  the  Court  observed  that  “[t]he  record”  in \nFlorence provided “evidence that the seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who \nhas contraband,” and the record also demonstrated “that it would be difficult in practice \nto determine whether individual detainees fall within” the plaintiff’s “proposed exemption” \nfor detainees who had been arrested for less serious crimes.  Id. at 334.  This was true \nfor several reasons:  First, “[p]eople detained for minor offenses can turn out to be the \nmost devious and dangerous criminals.”  Id. at 334-35 (providing anecdotal examples).  \nSecond,  “[e]xperience  shows  that  people  arrested  for  minor  offenses  have  tried  to \nsmuggle prohibited items into jail, sometimes by using their rectal cavities or genitals for \nthe concealment.”  Id. at 335.  Third, “[e]ven if people arrested for a minor offense do not \nthemselves wish to introduce contraband into a jail, they may be coerced into doing so \nby others”—“for example, [if] a person arrested and detained for unpaid traffic citations is \nnot subject to the same search as others, this will be well known to other detainees with \njail experience.”  Id. at 336.  And fourth, “[i]t . . . may be difficult, as a practical matter, to \nclassify inmates by their current and prior offenses before the intake search.”  Id.  Intake \nofficials “would be required, in a few minutes, to determine”—on pain of possible liability, \n“or even . . . charges of discriminatory application”—“whether any of the underlying \noffenses were serious enough to authorize the more invasive search protocol.”  Id. at 337.   \nThus, Florence held that “courts must defer to the judgment of correctional officials \nunless  the  record  contains  substantial  evidence  showing  their  policies  are  an \nunnecessary or unjustified response to problems of jail security.”  Id. at 322-33.  Doing so \nin Florence meant that “every detainee who will be admitted to the general population \nmay be required to undergo a close visual inspection while undressed.”  Id. at 322. \n10 \n \n\nFlorence  emphasized,  however,  that  its  holding  does  not  apply  to  every \nconceivable prison strip search.  Specifically, the Court noted that it was not asked “to \nrule on the types of searches that would be reasonable in instances where, for example, \na detainee will be held without assignment to the general jail population and without \nsubstantial contact with other detainees.”  Id. at 338-39.  The Court also noted that it was \nnot asked to consider the case of “an arrestee whose detention has not yet been reviewed \nby a magistrate or other judicial officer, and who can be held in available facilities removed \nfrom the general population.”  Id. at 339.  See also id. at 340 (Roberts, C.J., concurring) \n(“[I]t is important for me that the Court does not foreclose the possibility of an exception \nto  the  rule  it  announces.    Justice  Kennedy[’s  majority  opinion]  explains  that  the \ncircumstances before it do not afford an opportunity consider that possibility.”); id. (Alito, \nJ., concurring) (“join[ing] the opinion of the Court but emphasiz[ing] the limits of [its] \nholding”); In re Nassau Cnty. Strip Search Cases, 639 F. App’x 746, 750-51 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(“[T]he  Supreme  Court  [in  Florence]  indicated  that  categorically  strip-searching  the \nfollowing two classes of detainees may not pass constitutional muster: (1) detainees \ncharged with misdemeanors and segregated alone from the general population; and (2) \ndetainees charged with misdemeanors and segregated with other detainees charged with \nmisdemeanors from the general population.”) (emphasis in original). \n*  *  * \n  With these background principles in mind, the Court now addresses the pending \nmotions in the Erie action and the Niagara action. \n \n \n11 \n \n\nB. The Erie action (04-CV-534) \nThe Erie action is, procedurally, more complex than the Niagara action.  The Erie \nDefendants, as noted, have moved for summary judgment.  Rather than opposing that \nmotion, however, the Erie Plaintiffs filed several motions of their own.  First, the Erie \nPlaintiffs moved to amend their complaint, seeking (1) to allege that a purported policy of \ngroup strip searches violates the Fourth Amendment, even after Florence; and (2) to bring \na claim under the New York State Constitution.  See Docket No. 303-9.  After the Erie \nDefendants  responded  to  that  motion,  the  Erie  Plaintiffs  moved  (1)  for  an  order \ndecertifying the Erie class; and (2) for an order voluntarily dismissing this case pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2).  In their motion to decertify and for voluntarily \ndismiss, the Erie Plaintiffs “acknowledge that they cannot assert claims under the Federal \nconstitution under Florence for the searches they endured.”  Docket No. 315-1 ¶ 4.  The \nCourt addresses each motion in turn. \na.  The Erie Plaintiffs’ motion to amend \nThe  Erie  Plaintiffs  first  move  to  amend  their  complaint  to  add  (1)  a  Fourth \nAmendment claim based on an alleged “group” strip search policy; and (2) a claim under \nthe New York State Constitution.  The Erie Defendants oppose this motion. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) provides that, as applicable here, a party \n“may amend its pleading only with . . . the court’s leave.  The court should freely give \nleave when justice so requires.”  It is well settled that this is a “permissive standard,” \nintended to promote the “strong preference for resolving disputes on the merits.”  Williams \nv. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 212-13 (2d Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted).  But this \ndoes not mean that “every request to amend must be granted.”  Panther Partners Inc. v. \n12 \n \n\nIkanos Commc’ns, Inc., 347 F. App’x 617, 620 (2d Cir. 2009).  Among the “grounds to \ndeny leave to amend [are] ‘undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the \nmovant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue \nprejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of the \namendment, etc.’”  Stiller v. Colangelo, 221 F.R.D. 316, 317 (D. Conn. 2004) (quoting \nFoman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). \nThe Erie Defendants argue that leave to amend should be denied because (1) the \nproposed new claims would be futile; (2) the Erie Plaintiffs waited too long to seek leave \nto amend; and (3) the Erie Defendants would suffer “substantial prejudice” if leave to \namend were granted.  Docket No. 305 at 12.  The Court offers no opinion on whether the \nPlaintiffs’ proposed amendments would be futile, particularly in light of the fact that the \nErie Plaintiffs’ proposed state law claim raises apparently novel issues of New York \nconstitutional law, over which the Court would likely decline to exercise supplemental \njurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(1). \nThe Court instead denies the Erie Plaintiffs’ motion to amend because the Plaintiffs \nwaited too long to file the motion, and because the Erie Defendants would be unduly \nprejudiced by the proposed eve-of-judgment amendment.  A court “plainly has discretion \n. . . to deny leave to amend where the motion is made after an inordinate delay, no \nsatisfactory explanation is offered for the delay, and the amendment would prejudice the \ndefendant.”  Cresswell v. Sullivan & Cromwell, 922 F.2d 60, 72 (2d Cir. 1990).   \nThis  case  was  filed  in  2004.    The  Erie  Defendants  represent—and  the  Erie \nPlaintiffs do not dispute10—that “[a]ll of the thirty-three depositions in this case were \n                                            \n10  The Court’s scheduling order (Docket No. 300) provided that the Erie Plaintiffs “may reply to Defendants’ \nresponse” to the Plaintiffs’ motion to amend.  The Erie Plaintiffs did not file any response. \n13 \n \n\ncompleted by December 2006.”  Docket No. 305 at 18.  The Court raised the issue of \nFlorence with the parties in 2011.11  The record does not show that the Erie Plaintiffs \nsought to raise group-search or state-law claims at any time during the seven-year period \nbetween when the complaint was filed and when the Court stayed this case in anticipation \nof Florence.  To be sure, the Erie Plaintiffs’ proposed group-search claims likely did not \ntake on particular resonance until Florence largely foreclosed individual-search claims.  \nBut the Erie Plaintiffs offer no reason why they could not have raised group-search claims \nor state-law claims prior to Florence.  Those claims were as available fourteen years ago \n(when this case was filed) as they were seven years ago (when the Court stayed this \ncase in light of Florence).  And because those claims were available well before Florence, \nthe Erie Plaintiffs have not offered a sufficient reason to excuse their delay in moving to \namend.  Cf. Cresswell, 922 F.2d at 72 (observing that, in considering a late-filed motion \nto amend, “the court is free to conclude that ignorance of the law is an unsatisfactory \nexcuse”).    \nThis  unexplained  delay  also  caused  at  least  some  prejudice  to  the  Erie \nDefendants.  See State Teachers Retirement Bd. v. Fluor Corp., 654 F.2d 843, 856 (2d \nCir. 1981) (“Mere delay, . . . absent a showing of bad faith or undue prejudice, does not \nprovide a basis for a district court to deny the right to amend.”); Evans v. Syracuse City \nSchool Dist., 704 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 1983) (“[T]he longer the period of an unexplained \ndelay, the less will be required of the nonmoving party in terms of a showing of prejudice.”)  \n                                            \n11  In deciding that the Erie Plaintiffs’ motion to amend was unduly delayed, the Court does not consider the \nperiod of time that has passed since Florence was decided.  The Erie Plaintiffs proposed amending their \ncomplaint following Florence, but the Court did not act on the Plaintiffs’ proposal.  Although the Erie Plaintiffs \ndid not seek any action from the Court during the intervening period—or simply move to amend—the Court \nalso shares some of the blame for failing to manage this case more aggressively. \n14 \n \n\n(quotation marks omitted).  The Erie Defendants assert—quite reasonably—that group-\nsearch claims were “never a focus of discovery,” and that, at this late stage, “all but one \nof the named individual defendants . . . are either retired or have moved on to other \nendeavors.”  Docket No. 305 at 20.  Moreover, there is obvious prejudice in asking \nwitnesses to recall events that occurred, at the most recent, nearly fourteen years ago.   \nThe Erie Plaintiffs attempt to downplay this prejudice, pointing to evidence from \ndiscovery  suggesting  that  at  least  some  detainees  were  subjected  to  group  strip \nsearches.  But even if this is true, it does not mitigate the prejudice to the Erie Defendants.  \nThe Fourth Amendment question in this case “requires a balancing of the need for the \nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.”  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979).  The Fourth Amendment question is, therefore, very \nfact dependent, and no matter the theory of liability, it cannot be answered solely on the \nbasis of testimony from the individual Plaintiffs or other class members.  To take one \nexample, the Erie Defendants may have focused their discovery on different issues if they \nanticipated having to argue that group strip searches and individual strip searches were \nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.   \nGiven the Erie Plaintiffs’ delay in seeking to add group-search and state-law \nclaims, the Erie Defendants have shown sufficient prejudice such that the Plaintiffs’ \nmotion to amend should be denied.  Thus, the Erie Plaintiffs’ motion to amend is denied. \nb.  The Plaintiffs’ motion to decertify the class \nThe Erie Plaintiffs next move to decertify the class.  The Court previously granted \nthe Erie Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and certified a class pursuant to Federal \n15 \n \n\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).  See Docket No. 264.  Specifically, the Court certified \nthe following class: \nAll persons who have been placed into the custody of the Erie County \nCorrectional Facility and/or the Erie County Holding Center after being \ncharged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, \ntraffic infractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and were strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Erie County Correctional Facility and/or \nthe Erie County Holding Center pursuant to the policy, custom, and practice \nof the Erie County Sheriff’s Department and the County of Erie.  The class \nperiod  commences  on  July  22,  2001  and  extends  until  May  1,  2004.  \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their \nrespective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees, or \nassignees.12 \n \nThe Erie Plaintiffs, as noted, have moved to decertify the class.  Rule 23(c)(1)(C) \nprovides that “[a]n order that grants . . . class certification may be altered or amended \nbefore final judgment.”  The obvious effect of decertification “is to allow the absent class \nmembers to avoid being bound by the decision [on the merits].”  7AA Charles Alan Wright \n&  Arthur  R.  Miller,  Federal  Practice  &  Procedure  §  1785.4,  at  487  (3d  ed.  2005) \n(hereinafter “Wright & Miller”).  The resulting inequity is equally obvious: “If the class has \nlost on the merits, this result may be inappropriate when the opponent has devoted the \ntime and resources necessary to defend a class suit and now finds that only the named \nplaintiffs are bound and the same issues may have to be retried.”  Id. \nDespite the possible inequities of decertification, the Court has “‘an affirmative \nobligation to ensure’ that class certification remains appropriate throughout the litigation.”  \nMendez v. The Radec Corp., 260 F.R.D. 38, 42 (W.D.N.Y. 2009) (quoting Wu v. MAMSI \n                                            \n12  The Court also certified two subclasses: one for class members “who were placed in the custody of the \nErie County Holding Center during the class period,” and a second for class members “who were placed in \nthe Erie County Correctional Facility during the class period.”  Id. at 13-14. \n \n16 \n \n\nLife & Health Ins. Co., 256 F.R.D. 158, 162-63 (D. Md. 2008)).  This is because a \njudgment in a class action binds absent class members.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(3).  Courts \nare therefore “‘required to reassess their class rulings as the case develops.’”  Boucher \nv. Syracuse Univ., 164 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 1999) (quotation marks omitted).  See also \nMazzei v. Money Store, 829 F.3d 260, 266 (2d Cir. 2016) (observing that a district court \nhas the “affirmative duty of monitoring its class decisions in light of the evidentiary \ndevelopment of the case”) (quotation marks omitted). \nThe fundamental question a court must answer when deciding a decertification \nmotion is whether, in light of post-certification events—such as changes in the law or facts \nunderlying a decision to certify a class—“‘it appears that the requirements of Rule 23 are \nnot in fact met.’”  Id. (quoting Sirota v. Solitron Devices, Inc., 673 F.2d 566, 572 (2d Cir. \n1982)).  Thus, an intervening change in the law provides a basis to decertify when, had \nthe law been different at the time of certification, certification would not have been \nappropriate.  See Doe v. Karadzic, 192 F.R.D. 133, 136 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (decertifying \nclass where intervening Supreme Court case law “provide[d] the Court with a new starting \npoint for determining the appropriateness of class certification”).  In other words, a change \nin the law governing the merits of a class action is not necessarily a sufficient reason to \ndecertify a class; rather, a change in the law must affect whether certification remains \nproper in light of the requirements of Rule 23.   \nThe  Erie  Plaintiffs  do  not  explain  how  Florence  affects  the  Court’s  class \ncertification order: that is, they do not show how Florence affects the Court’s consideration \nof any of Rule 23(a)’s class-certification prerequisites, nor do they show how Florence \nchanges the Court’s analysis under Rule 23(b)(3).  Rather, they merely assert that \n17 \n \n\ndecertification is appropriate “[g]iven this change in the law, and the fact that notice was \nnot sent to the class given the pendency and aftermath of the Florence decision.”  Docket \nNo.  315-1  ¶  4.    But  Florence  does  not  appear  to  affect  the  class’s  numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, or the adequacy of the class’s representation.  See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a).  Likewise, Florence has no apparent bearing on whether “questions of law or \nfact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual \nmembers,” nor does it change whether “class action is superior to other available methods \nfor fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  Instead, \nFlorence  simply  means  that  the  entire  Erie  class—rather  than  just  the named Erie \nPlaintiffs—are likely to lose on the merits.  The Erie Plaintiffs have not provided authority \nfor the proposition that the likelihood of success on the merits has any relevance to a \ndecision to certify (or, as here, decertify) a class.13 \nThe Court, however, must be cognizant of the fact that, if it does not decertify the \nclass, judgment will be entered against the entire class, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(3), and that \njudgment could have res judicata effect that the Court cannot predetermine.  See Advisory \nCommittee Note (ACN) to 1966 Amendment to Rule 23(c)(3) (“[S]ubdivision (c)(3) does \nnot  disturb  the  recognized  principle  that  the  court  conducting  the  action  cannot \npredetermine  the  res  judicata  effect  of  the  judgment;  this  can  be  tested  only  in  a \nsubsequent action.”); 7AA Wright & Miller § 1789, at 553-554 (“It is well settled that the \ncourt adjudicating a dispute cannot predetermine the binding effect of its own judgment; \n                                            \n13  Indeed, it is unclear whether a court can decertify a class or modify a certification order for reasons other \nthan a failure to comply with Rule 23.  See 7AA Wright & Miller § 1785.4, at 481-82 (“The reasons given by \nthe courts for altering certification orders are similarly diffuse and have included lack of numerosity, lack of \ncommonality, the inadequacy of the named plaintiffs as class representatives, inadequacy of counsel and \na lack of manageability.”) (footnotes omitted). \n18 \n \n\nthat can be tested only in a subsequent suit.”)  The problems this presents are heightened \nin this case because—despite this case’s vintage—class members have not yet received \nnotice of their membership in the class.  As a result, a decision not to decertify the class \nwould possibly extinguish any claims the absent class members might have—under a \ngroup-search Fourth Amendment theory, under State law, or otherwise—and it would do \nso without ever giving those class members notice that their potential claims had been \nextinguished.   \nThe result is an obvious due process problem.  Rule 23(c)(2) requires notice for a \nRule 23(b)(3) class.  That requirement is “‘not . . . discretionary’”—indeed, it “‘is designed \nto fulfill requirements of due process to which the class action procedure is of course \nsubject.’”  Eisen v. Carlisle and Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 173 (1974) (quotation marks \nomitted).  See also 7AA Wright & Miller § 1786, at 492-95 (“Without [Rule 23(c)(2)’s] \nnotice requirement it would be constitutionally impermissible to give the judgment binding \neffect against the absent class members. . . .  In light of [Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank \n& Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950) and other cases] it seems clear that effective notice \nmust be provided in a Rule 23(b)(3) action as a prerequisite to binding the absent \nmembers of the class.”) \nGiven the serious due process concerns raised by entering judgment against a \ncertified  Rule  23(b)(3)  class  whose  members  have  not  received  notice,  the  Court \ndecertifies the Erie class.  Of course, the Court’s concern about entering judgment against \nthe class may ultimately end up being academic: Although the class is quite large—\npotentially including 30,000 detainees, Docket No. 264 at 6—it is also limited to those \npeople who were detained at any time during a roughly three-year period that ended on \n19 \n \n\nMay 1, 2004.  Thus, it is possible that the former class members’ claims may largely be \ntime-barred.14  But the Court is not in a position to evaluate the practical effects that \ndecertification  would  have  on  absent  class  members.    Those  questions  must  be \nanswered, if ever, in a subsequent action.  The Court’s concern at this time is simply \nwhether the Due Process Clause allows the Court to enter judgment against a class \nwhose members have not received the notice required by Rule 23(c)(2).  Because the \nanswer to that question is “no,” the Court grants the Erie Plaintiffs’ motion to decertify.15  \nThis  case  will  therefore  proceed  only  as  to  Plaintiffs  Adam  Pritchard  and  Edward \nRobinson in their individual capacities.16 \nc.  The Erie Plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss this case \nInstead of opposing the Erie Defendants’ summary judgment motion, the Erie \nPlaintiffs move to voluntarily dismiss their case pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2).  That Rule \nprovides that, except in circumstances not present here, “an action may be dismissed at \nthe plaintiff’s request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.”  The \nErie Plaintiffs seek voluntary dismissal because, they claim, they have “well-founded and \ncompelling claims against Erie County under the New York State Constitution,” which \n                                            \n14  The Court offers no opinion on this question. \n \n15  “[N]otice of decertification is required only to the extent necessary to reach those potential class members \nwho received notice of certification and relied on being included in the class.”  Hervey v. City of Little Rock, \n787 F.2d 1223, 1230 (8th Cir. 1986).  Because the class members in this case have not received notice of \ntheir membership in the class, the Court does not believe that it is necessary to notify the class members \nthat the class has been decertified.  Cf. Daisy Mountain Fire Dist. v. Microsoft Corp., 547 F. Supp. 2d 475, \n486 (D. Md. 2008) (noting that state rule, which was substantively identical to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2), is \n“concerned with ensuring that class members’ individual claims are not later barred by res judicata without \nhaving first notified them of this danger,” rather than with ensuring that class members have notice of “when \nclass action tolling ended”).  But see Barnett v. Experian Information Solutions, Inc., 236 F.R.D. 307, 308 \n(E.D. Tex. 2006) (ordering notice of decertification even though “there is no indication that any absent class \nmember is even aware of these proceedings”).   \n \n16  All future references to “the Erie Plaintiffs” in this Decision and Order will refer only to Plaintiffs Pritchard \nand Robinson. \n20 \n \n\nthey intend to bring in state court, and which they hope to have “relate back to the date \nof the original filing of this class action.”  Erie Docket No. 315-1 ¶ 6. \nWhether to grant a Rule 41(a)(2) motion to dismiss “is within the district court’s \nsound discretion.”  Cantanzano v. Wing, 277 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir. 2001).  “Generally,         \n. . . a voluntary dismissal without prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2) will be allowed if the \ndefendant will not be prejudiced thereby.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  In deciding \nwhether to grant a Rule 41(a)(2) motion, a court should consider: \n[1] the plaintiff’s diligence in bringing the motion; [2] any undue vexatiousness \non plaintiff’s part; [3] the extent to which the suit has progressed, including the \ndefendant’s  effort  and  expense  in  preparation  for  trial;  [4]  the  duplicative \nexpense of relitigation; and [5] the adequacy of plaintiff’s explanation for the \nneed to dismiss. \n \nId. at 110 (quoting Zagano v. Fordham Univ., 900 F.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir. 1990)). \n  The first and third factors weigh strongly in favor of denying the Erie Plaintiffs’ \nmotion.  The Supreme Court decided Florence in April 2012, but the Erie Plaintiffs waited \nto file their motion for voluntary dismissal—in which they admit that Florence forecloses \ntheir federal law claims—until five years later.  In other words, at no time during this period \ndid the Erie Plaintiffs seek to voluntarily dismiss what they now acknowledge are almost \ncertainly losing claims.  This factor weighs heavily in favor of denying the motion.   \nTo  be  sure,  the  “duplicative  expense  of  relitigation,”  id.,  would  likely  not  be \nenormous, given that most, if not all, of the discovery obtained from this case could likely \nbe used in a state case.  And the fact that the Erie Plaintiffs seek to dismiss this case so \nthat they may bring a separate, somewhat overlapping state case is a neutral factor—\n“[t]he mere prospect of a second lawsuit or some tactical disadvantage is not sufficient \nlegal prejudice to prevent a Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal.”  Jaskot v. Brown, 167 F.R.D. 372, \n21 \n \n\n373 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).  In other words, although the Erie Defendants would be prejudiced \nby a voluntary dismissal, that prejudice would not be severe.   \nNonetheless, the Erie Plaintiffs offer no explanation for their lengthy delay in \nseeking voluntary dismissal.  To be sure, the Court should have managed this case more \naggressively following Florence; doing so may have resulted in a more timely motion for \nvoluntary dismissal.  But the Erie Plaintiffs still waited an inordinate amount of time to file \ntheir motion, going so far as to allow the Erie Defendants to file a motion for summary \njudgment  before  moving  to  dismiss.    The  evidence  on  which  the  Erie  Defendants’ \nsummary judgment motion is based was surely also available to the Erie Plaintiffs for the \npast five years.  In other words, the basis for the Erie Plaintiffs’ motion—that is, the likely \nfutility of continuing their federal law claims—has been available for half-a-decade.  The \nErie Plaintiffs’ failure to move for voluntary dismissal during this time frame is dispositive \nof their motion.  The Erie Plaintiffs’ motion for voluntary dismissal is therefore denied. \nd.  The Erie Defendants’ motion for summary judgment  \nThe Court now addresses the Erie Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. \n1.  The effect of the Erie Plaintiffs’ failure to oppose the Erie \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment \n \nThe Erie Plaintiffs acknowledge that, in light of Florence, “they cannot assert claims \nunder the Federal constitution . . . for the searches they endured.”  Docket No. 315-1 ¶ 4.  \nThus, the Erie Plaintiffs do not oppose the Erie Defendants’ summary judgment motion.  \nThe Court may not, however, grant a motion for summary judgment simply because it is \nunopposed.  See Vermont Teddy Bear Co., Inc. v. 1-800-Beargram Co., 373 F.3d 241, \n242 (2d Cir. 2004) (“Even when a motion for summary judgment is unopposed, the district \n22 \n \n\ncourt is not relieved of its duty to decide whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.”)   \nBut the Erie Plaintiffs’ failure to oppose the Erie Defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment does mean that the Court may consider the Erie Defendants’ Statement of \nMaterial Facts to be “undisputed for purposes of the motion.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2).  \nSee  also  L.R.  Civ.  P.  56(a)(2)  (“Each  numbered  paragraph  in  the  moving  party’s \nstatement of material facts may be deemed admitted for purposes of the motion unless it \nis specifically controverted by a correspondingly numbered paragraph in the opposing \nstatement.”)  Given the Erie Plaintiffs’ ample opportunity to oppose the Erie Defendants’ \nsummary judgment motion; the Erie Plaintiffs’ decision to respond to the Erie Defendants’ \nsummary judgment motion with a motion to amend and a motion to decertify; and the Erie \nPlaintiffs’ acknowledgement that their claims cannot survive Florence, the Court will deem \nthe  Erie  Defendants’  Statement  of  Material  Facts,  where  supported  by  the  record, \nundisputed only “for purposes of th[is] [summary judgment] motion.”  Id.  See 2010 ACN \nto Rule 56(e) (“The fact is considered undisputed only for purposes of the motion.”); \nBetterson v. HSBC Bank, USA, N.A., 139 F. Supp. 3d 572, 582 (W.D.N.Y. 2015) (“The \nCourt is cognizant that it has discretion to excuse a party’s failure to file a statement of \nfacts, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that a district court should \nnot deem unopposed facts to [b]e admitted when those facts are unsupported by the \nrecord.”) (citing Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., 258 F.3d 62, 73-74 (2d Cir. 2001)). \n2.  Undisputed facts relevant to the Erie Defendants’ motion \nfor summary judgment \n \nErie County operates two facilities that are at issue in this case: the Erie County \nCorrectional Facility (ECCF) and the Erie County Holding Center (ECHC).  The ECHC “is \n23 \n \n\na traditional holding center or lockup,” which “served as the principle intake point for \nindividuals arrested by the Erie County Sheriff, the City of Buffalo Police, and other police \nagencies” throughout Erie County.  Erie Docket No. 301-1 (Erie Statement of Material \nFacts (SMF)) ¶ 17.  Part of the ECHC is also used as a jail for sentenced inmates.  Id.  In \ncontrast, the ECCF is “a traditional correctional facility or ‘jail,’” at which inmates are \nhoused after they begin serving a period of incarceration.  Id. ¶ 16.  The ECCF may, \nhowever, also house “overflow prisoners from the ECHC,” who are transferred to the \nECCF “after being processe[d] and housed at the ECHC.”  Id. ¶ 18. \nBy January 1997, a revised search strip-search policy became effective at the \nECHC.  See Erie Docket No. 301-5.17  As relevant to this case, the policy provided a \nlengthy  explanation  of  when,  and  why,  strip  searches  were  permitted  or  required.  \nBecause it is central to the issues in this case, the Court recites the relevant parts of the \npolicy in full.  (All underlining and typographical errors are contained in the original policy.) \nIMPORTANT: \n \n  Due to a decision handed down from the New York State of Appeals \n[sic], (Dell v. Weber), regarding strip searches, the following procedure(s) will \nbe followed: \n \n  Those arraigned individuals booked in the facility on a violation or \nmisdemeanor charge will not be strip-searched unless a *reasonable, justifiable \nsuspicion exists  that this  individual may  be  secreting  contraband  on  their \nperson.  If this suspicion exists, this individual will be secured in an Isolation \nUnit  in  Booking  and  the  Supervisor  will  be  notified.    It  will  then  be  the \nresponsibility of the Supervisor to determine whether this reasonable suspicion \nwarrants a strip-search.  any such decisions to strip-search will be thoroughly \ndocumented in the Booking and Supervisor/s Log Books and an informational \n                                            \n17  The policy filed as part of the Erie Defendants’ summary judgment motion states that the policy became \neffective in April 1986 and was revised in April 1991 and January 1997.  The policy does not state, however, \nwhat changes were made at those times.  \n24 \n \n\nsheet, outlining the  search and  the  reasons for  authorizing  same,  will  be \nforwarded to the Superintendent’s Ofc. \n \n* Reasonable suspicion will include the circumstances of the individual’s \ncrime (drug raid, weapons’ possession); the individual’s prior criminal history \n(weapons  or  drug  charges),  if  known,  the  individual’s  behavior \n(violent/assaultive or threatening); or the individual’s overt possession of drugs \nor weapons.  All arraigned inmates booked into the facility on felony charges \nwill be strip-searched. \n \n  All arraigned individuals booked into the facility will be required to be \nshowered and changed into facility issued clothing consistent with facility health \nrequirements.  If the above criteria is not present to warrant a strip-search, care \nmust be taken to ensure that his inmate’s privacy interests are not violated. \n \nStrip searches are mandatory at the following times and will be conducted in \nan area which will ensure the privacy of the inmate being searched: \n1.  Upon admission for those arraigned inmates charged with a felony. \n2.  After a contact visit.  This strip-search will be conducted in the Search Rooms \nadjacent to the visiting room. \n3.  After an inmate’s return to the facility from the outside, i.e., Court, hospital, \nclinic, etc. \n4.  If an inmate is leaving on a long distance trip to another facility, the Transporting \nDeputies will conduct a strip search prior to leaving the facility. \n5.  At any time a Supervisor feels that this type of search is warranted during a \nshakedown instead of a pat search. \n \nId. at 5-6. \n \nThe policy defined a “strip search” as “a search during which an inmate is required \nto remove his/her clothing.”  Id. at 2.  The policy then instructed sheriff’s deputies on how \nto conduct a strip search, but the policy made clear that a “strip search” did not include a \nbody cavity search.  Id. at 6-7.18 \n                                            \n18  Rather, the policy provided that a “[b]ody cavity search may be authorized only in circumstances where \nthere are compelling reasons to believe that an inmate or inmates to be searched have secreted in a body \ncavity contraband the nature of which constitutes a clear threat to the safety and security of the facility \nand/or persons therein.”  Id. at 7.  The policy further required that a body cavity search would be performed \n25 \n \n\nAn almost identically-worded policy became effective at the ECCF by October \n2002.19  Erie Docket No. 301-6.  Thus, by January 1997, policy at the ECHC prohibited \nstrip  searches  (absent  reasonable  suspicion)  for  those  arraigned  on  violations, \nmisdemeanors, or other minor crimes, and by October 2002, policy at the ECCF was the \nsame.    By  contrast,  all  newly-arriving  detainees  charged  with  a  felony  were  strip-\nsearched, and strip searches were required when, for instance, an inmate left and \nreturned to a facility. \nPolicy at both the ECHC and the ECCF changed again in September 2003.  See \nErie Docket No. 301-7.  This new policy limited the use of strip searches even further: It \nstated that “strip searches shall not be performed on inmates, except as prescribed [in \nanother section of the policy], or where Individualized Reasonable Suspicion exists \nthat the inmate possessed contraband.”  Id. at 11 (emphasis in original).  The September \n2003 policy contained largely the same exceptions as those contained in the previous \npolicy, with the primary difference being that the September 2003 policy did not require \nstrip searches for those arraigned on felony charges.  Id.20  Finally, the 2003 policy \n                                            \n(1) only with “THE EXPLICIT AUTHORITY OF THE SUPERINTENDENT”; (2) “PURSUANT TO A COURT \nORDER”; and (3) at a hospital by a “QUALIFIED PHYSICIAN.”  Id. (emphases in original). \n \n19  The policy filed as part of the Erie Defendants’ summary judgment motion states that it was updated in \nApril 1991, in January 1997 (when the ECHC policy was updated), and in October 2002.  The Erie \nDefendants’ Statement of Material Facts states that the ECCF policy was the same as the ECHC policy “by \nJanuary 1997, at the latest.”  SMF ¶ 25.  The ECCF policy, however, does not support this claim, because \nthe policy does not show what changes were made to the policy in 1991,1997, and 2002.  Although it may \nbe reasonable to infer that the Erie County Sherriff’s Department made identical changes to both facilities’ \npolicies at the same time, the record does not clearly support such a conclusion.  Because the summary-\njudgment standard requires the Court to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Erie Plaintiffs, \nthe Court cannot, for purposes of this motion, credit the Erie Defendants’ claim that strip-search policies at \nboth facilities were identical by January 1997.   \n \n20    The  new  policy  contained  several  other  exceptions.    It  required  strip  searches:  (1)  “[p]rior  to \nadministrative or disciplinary segregation”; (2) “[u]pon recapture following escape or absconding”; (3) “[p]rior \nto admission to constant supervision pursuant” to a suicide prevention plan; (4) “[d]uring scheduled area \nsearches (shakedowns) or any other area search, when strip searches are ordered by a supervisor”; and \n26 \n \n\nexpanded the criteria to be considered when deciding whether reasonable suspicion \nexisted for a strip search,21 and the new policy imposed additional reporting and review \nrequirements before a reasonable suspicion-based strip search could be conducted. Id. \nIn the face of these policies, the Erie Plaintiffs identify eight people who testified \nthat they were subjected to, witnessed, or conducted strip searches.22  Those people are \nthe remaining individual Plaintiffs—Adam Pritchard and Edward Robinson—four other \nformer detainees, and two former Erie County Sheriff’s Deputies.  Because the Erie \nPlaintiffs did not file an opposition to the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and \nbecause the Court has considered the Erie Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts \nundisputed for purposes of this motion, the Court’s decision is based solely on the facts \ncontained in the Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts.  In other words, if discovery \nrevealed any further evidence of strip searches consistent with the evidence that the Erie \nDefendants identify, the Court has not considered that evidence when deciding this \nmotion. \n                                            \n(5) “[f]ollowing any major incident or disturbance involving violence, weapons, hostages, narcotics, escape, \nabsconding, or following any other incident when strip searches are ordered by a supervisor.”  Id.   \n \n      The Erie Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts does not suggest that the Erie Plaintiffs were strip \nsearched at any time other than when they were admitted to the ECHC or the ECCF.  Thus, the Court offers \nno opinion on the constitutionality of strip searches conducted pursuant to one of the exceptions to the \nECHC and ECCF’s general no-strip-search policy.  \n \n21  For instance, reasonable suspicion could be supported by a deputy’s observations, by a detainee’s \n“[k]nown institutional  history of  possessing contraband,” and  or by “[i]nformation received from co-\ndefendants other inmates [sic] in the immediate proximity.”  Id. at 11-12. \n \n22  At several points in their motion, the Erie Defendants attack the credibility of, or attempt to impeach, the \nindividuals who testified consistently with the Erie Plaintiffs’ theory of the case.  See, e.g., Erie SMF ¶ 56 \n(“Adam Pritchard is a career felony criminal whose extensive rap sheet includes violent crimes such as \nassault and sexual abuse.”); id. ¶ 59 (“Edward Robinson has also had several run ins with the law, has \nbeen arrested numerous times, and was remanded to the ECHC on several occasions.”); Docket No. 301-\n29 at 8 (arguing that two sheriff’s deputies who testified on the Plaintiffs’ behalf “were poor employees with \nmultiple issues that ultimately led to resignation/termination”).  It is black-letter law, of course, that a court \nmay not weigh a witness’s credibility on a summary judgment motion. \n27 \n \n\nAs noted, the Erie Defendants identify eight people who might support the Erie \nPlaintiffs’ claims.  First, one of the individual Erie Plaintiffs, Adam Pritchard, claimed that, \nafter being remanded to the ECCF for a parole violation, he was directed to remove his \nclothing, “lift his genitals, bend over and spread his buttocks, and then place his hands \non the wall and expose the soles of each foot.”  Erie SMF ¶¶ 57-58.  The other Erie \nPlaintiff, Edward Robinson, claimed that he was subjected to a similar search.  Id. ¶¶ 61-\n63.  Likewise, the Erie Plaintiffs identify two former Erie County Sheriff’s Deputies who \ndescribed a strip-search procedure similar to that described by the Erie Plaintiffs.  Id. ¶ \n67.  Both of these former deputies, however, had limited involvement in jail intake (where \nsearches would be performed).  Id. ¶¶ 66, 73-74.   \nFinally, the Plaintiffs identify four other detainees who testified that they were strip \nsearched.  One detainee testified that a deputy “put his hand vertical and pushed it right \nin my crack, the buttocks, all the way in, and then he took his forefinger and thumb and \nreached in and pulled the underwear out.”  Id. ¶ 79.  Another detainee testified that he \nwas subjected to a less invasive search that was similar to the searches described by \nErie Plaintiffs Pritchard and Robinson.  Id. ¶ 80.  The next detainee testified that she was \nstrip searched in a room with a group of other women.  According to her testimony, one \nwoman “had to remove her feminine product and throw it on the floor,” and each of the \nwomen was required to bend over, cough, and have her hair searched.  Id. ¶ 81.  Finally, \nanother detainee testified that he was subjected to a strip search, together with five or six \nother men, that required him “to step up to [a] line, bend over, and perform other tasks so \nthat the guard could check him.”  Id. ¶ 82. \n28 \n \n\nThe evidence described above, viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, \nis insufficient to support a § 1983 claim against Erie County or the individual Defendants \nin their official capacities.  As an initial matter, the evidence—even when viewed entirely \nin the Erie Plaintiffs’ favor—shows that the Erie Defendants did not have an official policy, \nduring the time period when the Erie Plaintiffs were strip searched, of strip-searching new \ndetainees  charged  with misdemeanors,  violations,  and  other minor  crimes.  To  the \ncontrary,  the  record  shows  that  the  Erie  Defendants  had  a  policy  prohibiting  such \nsearches as a matter of course, and permitting them only in limited circumstances.23 \nThus, to defeat the Erie Defendants’ summary judgment motion, the Erie Plaintiffs \nmust rely on several isolated claims of strip searches.  When this evidence is viewed in \nthe light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the evidence shows only that several sheriff’s \ndeputies conducted strip searches, and that they did so—possibly—in contravention of \npolicy prohibiting such searches.  Because this is the Erie Plaintiffs’ only viable theory of \nliability, it is important to remember the identities of the Erie Defendants: The Plaintiffs \nhave not sued the sheriff’s deputies who they claim strip searched them; they have \ninstead sued Erie County and several supervisory officials.24 \n                                            \n23  As noted at note 19, the record does not support the Erie Defendants’ claim that, by January 1997, policy \nat the ECCF prohibited strip searches of detainees arrested for minor offenses.  This issue, however, is \nimmaterial to the Court’s resolution of the Erie Defendants’ summary judgment motion.  Plaintiff Pritchard \ntestified that he was strip searched at the ECCF on May 13, 2003, see Docket No. 301-19 at 10—that is, \nat a time when it is undisputed that ECCF policy prohibited strip searches for non-felony detainees.  Plaintiff \nRobinson, by contrast, testified that he was strip searched at the ECHC, where, the record shows, policy \nprohibited intake strip searches during the time at issue. \n \n24  The Erie Defendants argue that judgment should be entered in their favor because, even assuming that \nthe searches were conducted as alleged, the searches “fall directly within the ambit of what the Supreme \nCourt held was permissible under Florence.”  That claim, however, is only true as to some of the individuals \nwho allege that they were strip searched.  Florence took care to note that “[t]here [were] no allegations that \nthe detainees [in Florence] were touched in any way as part of the searches.”  566 U.S. at 325; id. at 339 \n(while describing the limits of Florence’s holding, noting that “[t]here also may be legitimate concerns about \nthe invasiveness of searches that involve the touching of detainees”).  By contrast, the Erie Defendants \nidentify several individuals who allege that sheriff’s deputies did touch them—in one instance, quite \n29 \n \n\nAs to Erie County and the individual Erie Defendants in their official capacities, \nsummary judgment must be granted in favor of the Defendants.  As noted, during the time \nperiod at issue, Erie County Sheriff’s Department policy prohibited intake strip searches \nfor all but felony detainees (absent reasonable suspicion), and it later prohibited all intake \nstrip searches (again, absent reasonable suspicion).  The record contains evidence—\nassumed to be true for purposes of this motion—that at least some sheriff’s deputies \nconducted strip searches in violation of this policy.  But even with this evidence, and \nbased on the limited factual record before the Court, municipal liability may not attach to \nErie County or the individual Defendants in their official capacities.   \nIn the ordinary case, “municipal liability ‘under Section 1983 does not arise out of \nthe allegedly unconstitutional acts of an employee that are contrary to a municipality’s \nalleged policy.’”  Maldonado v. Schriro, 15 Civ. 3409 (PAE), 2017 WL 2633578, at *2 \n(S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2017) (quoting Zargary v. City of New York, No. 00 Civ. 897 (RJH), \n2010 WL 329959, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2010)) (emphasis in Maldonado).25  Although \nthere may be cases where an employee’s (or, more likely, employees’) unconstitutional \n                                            \ninvasively—as part of a strip search.  See, e.g., Erie SMF ¶¶ 63 (Plaintiff Robinson), 79 (another detainee).  \nThe limits of Florence’s holding, combined with these allegations, make it difficult to resolve the Erie \nDefendants’ summary judgment motion by simply holding that these allegations, even if true, are legal \nunder Florence.  Thus, by granting summary judgment for the Erie Defendants, the Court does not suggest \nany opinion on whether the strip-search allegations made by each person identified in the Erie Defendants’ \nStatement of Material Facts, if true, are constitutional after Florence.   \n \n25  See also City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 387 (1989) (observing that, where a municipality \nhas a policy that is constitutional, “without more,” the municipality would not “automatically be liable under \n§ 1983 if one of its employees happened to apply the policy in an unconstitutional manner, for liability would \nthen rest on respondeat superior”); City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 127 (1988) (“When an \nofficial’s discretionary decisions are constrained by policies not of that official’s making, those policies, \nrather than the subordinate’s departures from them, are the act of the municipality.”); Sullivan v. City of New \nYork, 690 F. App’x 63, 67 (2d Cir. 2017) (“[Plaintiff] provides insufficient evidence that any alleged violation \nresulted from a policy or custom.  In fact, [plaintiff] himself undermines his allegations of a policy or custom \nby contending that the arresting officers acted ‘contrary to the policy of the NYPD regarding potential \ndomestic violence matters’ when they arrested him.”) (citation omitted). \n \n30 \n \n\nactions can give rise to municipal liability despite the existence of a valid municipal policy, \nthe record in this case, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, does \nnot support such a claim.  Instead, the most that the evidence shows is that several \nsheriff’s deputies acted contrary to municipal policy.  Thus, summary judgment must be \ngranted to Erie County and the individual Defendants in their official capacities.26 \nAs to the individual Defendants in their individual capacity, the question is whether \nthe facts stated in the Erie Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts—assuming that they \nallege strip searches that are, for some reason, unconstitutional—are sufficient to allow \na reasonable jury to find that the individual Defendants are personally liable for their \nsubordinates’ wrongdoing.  Section 1983, as noted, does not allow liability to be imposed \non a respondeat superior basis.  Instead, “‘a plaintiff must establish a given defendant’s \npersonal involvement in the claimed violation in order to hold that defendant liable in his \nindividual capacity.’”  Warren v. Pataki, 823 F.3d 125, 136 (2d Cir. 2016) (quotation marks \nomitted).  “A plaintiff may establish such personal involvement by making any one of five \nshowings . . .:  \n(1) the defendant participated directly in the alleged constitutional violation, (2) the \ndefendant, after being informed of the violation through a report or appeal, failed \nto remedy the wrong, (3) the defendant created a policy or custom under which \nunconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed the continuation of such a policy or \n                                            \n26  Because the Erie Plaintiffs have not proffered any theory of municipal liability in opposition to the Erie \nDefendants’ summary judgment motion, the Court need not, and does not, consider alternate theories of \nmunicipal liability, such as ratification or failure to train.  See, e.g., Harris, 489 U.S. at 387 (holding that, “if \na concededly valid policy is unconstitutionally applied by a municipal employee,” “there are limited \ncircumstances in which an allegation of a ‘failure to train’ can be the basis for [municipal] liability under          \n§ 1983”); Amnesty Am. v. Town of W. Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 126 (2d Cir. 2004) (discussing ratification of \nconstitutional violations).  In other words, this Decision and Order is not meant to suggest that, if a \nmunicipality has a written policy prohibiting unconstitutional conduct, then the municipality cannot still have \na de facto policy that is unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Barcume v. City of Flint, 819 F. Supp. 631, 655 (E.D. \nMich. 1993) (“Even with the existence of an anti-discrimination policy, where that policy is allowed to be \nignored it may create a policy or custom contrary to that which was officially promulgated.”)  The Court’s \ndecision, as noted several times, is based solely on the facts contained in the Erie Defendants’ Statement \nof Material Facts, and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts.   \n31 \n \n\ncustom, (4) the defendant was grossly negligent in supervising subordinates who \ncommitted the wrongful acts, or (5) the defendant exhibited deliberate indifference \nto  the  rights  of  [the  plaintiffs]  by  failing  to  act  on  information  indicating  that \nunconstitutional acts were occurring. \n \nId. (quoting Colon v. Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 873 (2d Cir. 1995)). \n  The  Erie  Defendants’  Statement  of  Material  Facts,  viewed  in  the  light  most \nfavorable to the Erie Plaintiffs, does not raise a genuine dispute over any fact that is \nmaterial to the individual Erie Defendants’ liability under any of the five theories listed \nabove.  As noted, there is no evidence—and the Erie Plaintiffs have never suggested—\nthat the individual Erie Defendants personally conducted unconstitutional strip searches.  \nLikewise, nothing in the Erie Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts suggests that the \nindividual  Erie  Defendants  were  ever  “informed  of”  their  subordinates’  alleged \nunconstitutional strip searches.  Nothing in the Erie Defendants’ Statement of Material \nFacts suggests that the individual Erie Defendants “created” an unconstitutional policy—\nthe record, as noted several times, is plainly to the contrary.  And nothing suggests that \nany  of  the  individual  Erie  Defendants  “knew  or  should  have  known”  of  alleged \nunconstitutional strip searches, such that they may be found to be “grossly negligent.”  \nRaspardo v. Carlone, 770 F.3d 97, 117 (2d Cir. 2014).  Finally, nothing in the Erie \nDefendants’ Statement of Material Facts—even when viewed in the light most favorable \nto  the  Plaintiffs—suggests  that  the  individual  Erie  Defendants  were  provided  with \n“information indicating that unconstitutional acts were occurring.”  In short, the Erie \nDefendants’ Statement of Material Facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the Erie \nPlaintiffs, does not support a claim for individual liability under § 1983 against any of the \nindividual Erie Defendants. \n32 \n \n\nThe Court therefore grants the Erie Defendants’ motion for summary judgment \nagainst Adam Pritchard and Edward Robinson.27   \nC. The Niagara action (06-CV-291) \nUnlike the Erie action, the Plaintiffs in the Niagara action do not concede that \nsummary judgment against them is appropriate.  Instead, before Florence, both the \nNiagara Plaintiffs and the Niagara Defendants moved for partial summary judgment.  \nFollowing Florence, the Niagara Defendants renewed their motion for summary judgment, \nwhile the Niagara Plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint. \nBefore resolving these motions, however, the Court must address whether the \ncertified class may be maintained in its current form.28  The Court does so, because, as \nnoted above, courts are “required to reassess their class rulings as the case develops,”  \nBoucher v. Syracuse Univ., 164 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 1999) (quotation marks omitted), \n                                            \n27   Individual Erie Defendant H. McCarthy Gibson, who is represented by separate counsel, did not file a \nmotion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56.  He did, however, file a brief arguing that, after Florence, \n“even if Plaintiffs could prove that Defendants implemented the strip search policy alleged, Plaintiffs cannot \nsucceed in this action, and the Plaintiffs’ Class Action Complaint is subject to summary dismissal.”  Docket \nNo. 291 at 5.  A court may “grant summary judgment for a nonmovant” “[a]fter giving notice and a \nreasonable time to respond.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(1).  The Erie Plaintiffs have been on notice for some \ntime that judgment would likely be entered in favor of all the Erie Defendants, and they have provided no \nreason why judgment should not be entered in favor of Defendant Gibson.  Moreover, Defendant Gibson \nwas the superintendent of the ECHC, and strip-search policies at the ECHC have been thoroughly litigated \nin this case.  Given these facts, Defendant Gibson’s request for dismissal, the amount of time this case has \nbeen pending, and the Erie Plaintiffs’ post-Florence litigation strategy, it is appropriate to grant summary \njudgment for Defendant Gibson.  See 10A Wright & Miller § 2720.1, at 370-71 (“The practice of allowing \nsummary judgment to be entered for the nonmoving party in the absence of a formal cross-motion is \nappropriate.  It is in keeping with the objective of Rule 56 to expedite the disposition of cases and, somewhat \nmore remotely, with the mandate of Rule 54(c) requiring the court to grant the relief to which a party is \nentitled ‘even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.’”) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(c)) \n(footnotes omitted). \n \n28  The Court certified two classes in the Niagara action, but “Class Counsel was unable to secure a \nrepresentative Plaintiff” for one of the classes “and also declined to pursue” that class’s claims “given [class \ncounsel’s] further investigation into Niagara County’s practices.”  Docket No. 80 at 6.  Thus, the Court’s \ndiscussion of the “class” in the Niagara case only refers to Class One, which concerns detainees subjected \nto the NCJ’s Policy 1109.  See Docket No. 51 at 2-3 (describing Policy 1109). \n33 \n \n\nand the parties’ summary judgment briefing brings into question the propriety of the class \nas it is currently certified.   \na.  Whether Plaintiff Williams is an adequate class representative \n \nThe Court first addresses whether Plaintiff Dedrick Williams remains an adequate \nclass representative.  Summary judgment briefing revealed that, as to Plaintiff Williams, \nthere is a genuine dispute over a very material fact: whether Plaintiff Williams was ever \nstrip searched at the NCJ.  Plaintiff Williams testified that he was strip searched, but the \nNiagara Defendants claim that he was not, and that he has changed his story.  See \nDocket No. 88 ¶¶ 74-82.   \nBecause there is a substantial discrepancy over such a basic question, Plaintiff \nWilliams is no longer an adequate class representative.  Questions about his credibility \non a fundamental question would likely “unduly burden the class by diverting attention \nfrom the substance of the basic claim advanced on behalf of the class.”  Kronfeld v. Trans. \nWorld Airlines, Inc., 104 F.R.D. 50, 52 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).  See Savino v. Computer Credit, \nInc., 164 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 1998) (affirming finding that individual would not be an \nadequate class representative because he “offered differing accounts about the letters \nthat form the very basis of his lawsuit,” which would “surely . . . create serious concerns \nas to his credibility at any trial”); Darvin v. Int’l Harvester Co., 610 F. Supp. 255, 257 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1985) (“[I]nconsistent [deposition] testimony could create serious problems with \nrespect to plaintiff’s credibility and could become the focus of cross examination and \nunique defenses at trial, to the detriment of the class.  These credibility problems are a \nbasis for denying plaintiff’s motion to be named class representative.”)  Compare Lapin \nv. Goldman Sachs & Co., 254 F.R.D. 168, 177-78 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (collecting cases for \n34 \n \n\nthe proposition that “[im]material” discrepancies in a proposed representative’s testimony \n“do not foreclose a finding of adequacy”).    On or before March 16, 2018, the parties are \ntherefore directed to file proposals for how the Court should resolve Plaintiff Williams’s \nclaims, e.g., by dismissing or severing them.   \nb.  Whether the class should include detainees arrested on March 11, \n2005 \n \nThe circumstances surrounding Plaintiff Williams’s claims also call into question \nwhether the definition of the class remains proper.  Plaintiff Williams was apparently \narrested in what the Niagara Defendants rightly characterize as a “bizarre incident” in \nNiagara Falls City Court.  Docket No. 84-2 ¶ 74.  Neither party disputes that, on March \n11, 2005, the presiding judge in that court “arrested an entire courtroom.”  Docket No. 88 \n¶¶ 74-75.  Specifically, both parties agree that Plaintiff Williams “was in court as part of \n[a] domestic violence program.  He stated that someone’s wristwatch went off.  The judge \nbecame upset because he thought it was a cell phone and demanded that the person \nwho had the cell phone stand up.  When no one stood up, the judge ordered that everyone \ngo to jail.  The judge called each person in court up to the bench and revoked their bail.  \nEveryone who did not make bail was then sent to the NCJ.”  Id. ¶ 75.   \nAssuming that Plaintiff Williams, together with everyone else who was arrested \nfollowing the March 11, 2005 incident in Niagara Falls City Court, was strip searched, the \ncircumstances surrounding the searches are, to say the least, unusual.  Rule 23(a)(2)’s \ncommonality requirement asks whether a question of law or fact is “capable of classwide \nresolution—which means that its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 350 (2011).  “The claims for relief need not be identical for them to be common; \n35 \n \n\nrather, Rule 23(a)(2) simply requires that there be issues whose resolution will affect all \nor a significant number of the putative class members.”  Johnson v. Nextel Commc’ns \nInc., 780 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir. 2015).  This means that, “‘[w]here the same conduct or \npractice by the same defendant gives rise to the same kind of claims from all class \nmembers, there is a common question.’”  Id. (quoting Suchanek v. Sturm Foods, Inc., 764 \nF.3d 750, 756 (7th Cir. 2014)).29   \nThe fundamental question the Court must answer in this case is whether searches \nconducted pursuant to Policy 1109 are “reasonable” within the meaning of the Fourth \nAmendment.    Answering  that  question  requires  deferring,  to  some  degree,  to  the \njudgment of correctional officials.  That deference, however, may be unwarranted if “the \nrecord  contains  substantial  evidence  showing  their  policies  are  an  unnecessary  or \nunjustified response to problems of jail security.”  Florence, 566 U.S. at 322-23.  Assuming \nthat those arrested on March 11, 2005 were strip searched (and the record is not clear \non whether they were), it is far from certain that strip searching those arrestees was, \nunder the strange and unique circumstances of the arrests, reasonable.30  In other words, \nwhile a strip search may be “reasonable” in the case of the typical arrest and booking—\nfor instance, the arrest described in Florence, or the arrest and booking to which the vast \nmajority  of  NCJ  detainees  are  surely  subjected—whether  a  strip  search  would  be \n                                            \n29  The question of commonality “may sometimes overlap with merits issues, though the determination as \nto a Rule 23 requirement is not binding on the trier of fact in its determination of the merits.”  Id. at 138.  \nThus, the Court’s comments about claims arising from the March 11, 2005 arrests do not mean that the \nCourt has pre-formed any views about the merits of such claims. \n \n30  Cf. id. at 340 (Roberts, C.J., concurring) (“[I]t is important for me that the Court does not foreclose the \npossibility of an exception to the rule it announces.  Justice Kennedy[’s majority opinion] explains that the \ncircumstances  before  the  Court  do  not  afford  an  opportunity  to  consider  that  possibility.    Those \ncircumstances include the facts that [the plaintiff] was detained not for a minor traffic violation but instead \npursuant to a warrant for his arrest, and that there was apparently no alternative, if [he] were to be detained, \nto holding him in the general jail population.”) (citation omitted). \n36 \n \n\nreasonable in the circumstances presented by the March 11, 2005 group arrests is a \ndifferent question.   \nAs a result, answering the question whether Policy 1109 is reasonable in the mine-\nrun of cases would not “resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the \nclaims in one stroke.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350.  That is, it would not necessarily resolve \nwhether alleged strip searches resulting from the March 11, 2005 group arrests were \nreasonable.  And while the circumstances surrounding the arrest of every NCJ detainee \nare obviously unique, nothing in the record suggests what those differences are or why \nthe  differences  are  constitutionally  significant.    By  contrast,  the  circumstances \nsurrounding the March 11, 2005 arrests are highlighted in the record, and they have the \npotential to be constitutionally significant. \nThe Court therefore modifies the class definition in this case to exclude any person \nwho became a class member by virtue of being arrested on March 11, 2005 for being \npresent in a Niagara Falls City Court courtroom in which the entire courtroom was \narrested.  On or before March 16, 2018, the parties shall file proposals addressing how \nthe Court should resolve claims against those class members.   \nc.  Whether the class members should be notified before the Court \nresolves the pending motions \n \nThe last issue the Court must address with regard to the class is notification.  As \nwith  the  Erie  class,  the  Niagara  class  members  have  not  received  notice  of  their \nmembership in the certified class.  But unlike the Erie class, the Niagara Plaintiffs moved \nto provide notice to the class members.  Docket No. 73.  That motion, however, has not \nbeen resolved.   \n37 \n \n\nNotice is mandatory for a Rule 23(b)(3) class.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B).  \nAnd notice should be given “‘well before the merits of the case are adjudicated.’”  Brown \nv. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 613 F.3d 44, 51 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting \nSchwarzschild v. Tse, 69 F.3d 293, 295 (9th Cir. 1995)).  Here, however, both parties \nmoved for summary judgment before seeking resolution of the motion to provide notice \nto the class.31   \nThe  Court,  however,  cannot  resolve  the  parties’  cross-motions  for  summary \njudgment without first addressing whether the class members should receive notice of \ntheir membership in the class.  “Notice is crucial to the entire scheme of Rule 23(b)(3)”: \nnotice “serves to inform absentees who might otherwise not be aware of the proceeding \nthat  their  rights  are  in  litigation  so  that  they  can  take  whatever  steps  they  deem \nappropriate to make certain that their interests are protected.  In this way, it guarantees \neach class member an opportunity to have a day in court or, at least, to oversee the \nconduct of the action by the representatives.”  7AA Wright & Miller § 1786, at 492-94.  \nThe Court cannot, then, consider the parties’ summary judgment motions—which may \nresult in judgment being entered for or against the class—without at least considering \n                                            \n31  The Second Circuit does not appear to have addressed this issue, but other courts of appeals have held \nthat, where the defendant files a motion for summary judgment before the class receives notice, the \ndefendant “effectively waive[s] [its] right to have such notice circulated to the class” and that, “in such cases, \nthe district court’s decision binds only the named plaintiffs.”  Schwarzschild v. Tse, 69 F.3d 293, 297 (9th \nCir. 1995).  See, e.g., Postow v. OBA Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 627 F.2d 1370, 1382 (D.C. Cir. 1980); Katz \nv. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d 747, 759 (3d Cir. 1974) (en banc).  The situation here is different, however, \nbecause the Niagara Defendants moved for summary judgment only after the Niagara Plaintiffs did so, and \nafter the Niagara Plaintiffs moved to notify the class.  Under these circumstances, the Niagara Defendants \ncannot be said to waived their right to have the class members notified of their membership in the class.   \n \n38 \n \n\nwhether the class members should be given an opportunity to enter an appearance or \nrequest exclusion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2).32 \nThus, on or before March 16, 2018, the parties should advise the Court whether \nthe members of the Niagara class should receive notice of their membership in the class \nbefore the Court considers the pending motions to amend and for summary judgment.  If \nthe Court ultimately does not notify the class members, the Court will decertify the Niagara \nclass for the same reasons the Court decertified the Erie class.33    \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the pending motions in these cases are resolved as \nfollows: \nIn Pritchard, et al. v. The County of Erie, et al., 04-CV-0534: \n(1) The Plaintiffs’ motion to decertify the class (Docket No. 315) is granted; \n(2) The Plaintiffs’ motion for voluntary discontinuance (Docket No. 315) is denied; \n(3) The Plaintiffs’ motion to amend (Docket No. 303) is denied; and \n(4) The Defendants’ motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 301) is granted to \nthe extent it seeks judgment against Plaintiffs Adam Pritchard and Edward \nRobinson.  To the extent the Defendants seek summary judgment against \nformer-Plaintiff Juleen Tucker, or against any member of the now-decertified \nclass, that motion is denied as moot.  As to Plaintiffs Adam Pritchard and \nEdward  Robinson,  the  Clerk  of  Court  shall  enter  judgment  in  favor  of \n                                            \n32  Out of an abundance of caution, the Court will also defer decision on the Niagara Plaintiffs’ motion to \namend until issues concerning class notification are resolved. \n \n33  The Court resolves the Niagara case in this way, rather than by sua sponte decertifying the class, \nbecause neither party has addressed the pending motion to notify the Niagara class.  The Niagara action \nis therefore different from the Erie action because, in the Erie action, both parties moved to decertify the \nclass.  See Erie Docket No. 293 at 1; Docket No. 315-1 ¶ 4. \n39 \n \n\nDefendants The County of Erie; Patrick M. Gallivan, in both his individual and \nofficial capacities; Timothy Howard, in both his individual and official capacities; \nDonald Livingston, in both his individual and official capacities; Robert G. \nHuggins, in both his individual and official capacities; and H. McCarthy Gibson, \nin both his individual and official capacities.  \n(5) The Clerk of Court shall take all steps necessary to close this case. \n \nIn Williams, et al. v. The County of Niagara, et al., 06-CV-0291: \n(1) Plaintiff Dedrick Williams is removed as a class representative; \n(2) The Court modifies the definition of Class One to exclude any person who \nbecame a class member by virtue of being arrested on March 11, 2005 for \nbeing present in a Niagara Falls City Court courtroom in which the entire \ncourtroom was arrested; \n(3) The Court defers decision on the pending motions to amend and for summary \njudgment until issues concerning class notification are resolved; and  \n(4) On or before March 16, 2018, the parties shall: \na.  Propose how Plaintiff Williams’ claims should be resolved;  \nb.  Propose how the Court should resolve claims by class members who \nwere arrested on March 11, 2005 as a result of their presence in Niagara \nFalls City Court; and \nc.  Advise the Court whether the members of the Niagara class should \nreceive  notice  of  their  membership  in  the  class  before  the  Court \nconsiders the pending motions to amend and for summary judgment. \n40 \n \n\n \nSO ORDERED.   \n \nDated: February 22, 2018            __S/Richard J.

I am, together with co-counsel, counsel for Adam Pritchard, Edward Robinson, and the certified class in this \naction. I serve as lead counsel for the class. By recent order, the Court directed that the Plaintiff respond to the \nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment by today, October 6, 2017.  \n  2. By this motion, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court stay briefing on this Motion pending the Plaintiffs \nfiling a Motion for Voluntary Discontinuance of this action without prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2). \nSpecifically, the Plaintiff acknowledges that their claims, and the claims of the certified class, are no longer [*2]  \nviable after the United States Supreme Court's decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders. Furthermore, \nthe Plaintiffs further acknowledge that they cannot sustain a class regarding group strip searches given the factual  \n  1  \n  record in this case, which is inconsistent on this issue. The Plaintiffs have filed a motion for leave to amend their \ncomplaint to plead state law claims against Erie County. The Plaintiffs further acknowledge that issues of comity \nand  supplemental  jurisdiction  counsel  against  this  Court  asserting  jurisdiction  over  New  York  State  law \nconstitutional claims that will likely represent issues of first impression for the New York Court of Appeals. Given \nthat the Plaintiffs intend to seek permission from the Court to discontinue this action without prejudice, and will also \nbe seeking to decertify the class in this case with leave to renew before a different forum, the Plaintiffs respectfully \nsuggest that the Court stay briefing on the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment so that the Plaintiffs can \nbring an appropriate motion to resolve this case here.  \n\nPage 2 of 2\n2017 U.S. DIST. CT. MOTIONS LEXIS 102243, *2\n  3. The Plaintiffs will file a Motion for Discontinuance and to Decertify the Class on or before October [*3]  13, 2017.  \n  4. The Plaintiffs have sought the consent of Defendants for this request, and the Defendants have not provided \ntheir consent.  \n  5. Plaintiffs respectfully suggest that good cause exists for this request. In short, it makes little sense to have the \nCourt consider briefing on a case that will likely be discontinued. Should the Court not agree, the Plaintiff requests \nan extension of time to respond to this motion commensurate with the Court's discretion.  \n  6. The Plaintiffs anticipate that the Court will address this request by way of a text order. Should a proposed order \nbe required, one will be promptly submitted to the Court.  \n  Respectfully Submitted By:  \n  /s Elmer Robert Keach, III  \n  Dated: October 6, 2017 Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire  \n  LAW OFFICES OF ELMER ROBERT  \n  KEACH, III, PC  \n  One Pine West Plaza, Suite 109  \n  Albany, NY 12205  \n  Telephone: _ 518.434.1718  \n  Facsimile: 518.770.1558  \n  Electronic Mail:  \nbobkeach@keachlawfirm.com \n  ATTORNEY FOR PLAINTIFFS  \n  [SEE ATTACHMENT IN ORIGINAL]\nEnd of Document",

MOTIONS LEXIS 102173 *\nPritchard et al v. The County of Erie et al\nType: Motion\nJudges\nRichard J. Arcara\nTitle\nRESPONSE IN OPPOSITION\nText\n [*1]   DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR VOLUNTARY \nDISCONTINUANCE  \n  Defendants County of Erie (\"County\"), Patrick M. Gallivan, Timothy Howard, Donald Livingston and Robert \nHuggins (collectively referred to herein as \"Defendants\") submit this response in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion \n(Docket No. 315) which seeks an order of the Court granting Plaintiffs voluntary dismissal of the case pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. Pro. (\"FRCP\") 41(a)(2).  \n  1. Defendants respectfully request that the Court deny this motion and proceed with determining the pending \nmotions on their merits.1  \n  1 Defendants hereby incorporate by reference their summary judgment motion (Docket No. 301), their opposition \nto Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint (Docket No. 305), and their response (Docket No. 311) to \nPlaintiffs' initial request for leave to file this motion (Docket No. 310) - on which the Court did not rule before Plaintiff \nonce again decided to ignore the Court's direction and simply file the present motion. Defendants respectfully refer \nthe Court to those submissions for a full recitation of the relevant background, facts, and law applicable to this \nmatter.  \n  2. Plaintiffs' [*2]  representations to this Court that they now seek voluntary dismissal of this action as some good \nfaith recognition of the ultimate invalidity of their claims is the height of disingenuousness. This is nothing more than \nthe last desperate and improper attempt by Plaintiffs to circumvent what should be the definitive and inevitable \nconclusion to the case that they commenced over thirteen (13) years ago.  \n  3. As stated in Defendants' summary judgment motion (Docket No. 301), opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for leave \nto amend their complaint (Docket No. 305), and opposition to Plaintiffs' request for a further stay of the summary \njudgment briefing (Docket No. 310), when the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in 2012 in Florence \nv. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, 566 US 318, 132 S. Ct 1510 (2012), it was abundantly \nclear that Plaintiffs' claims in this action were without merit.  \n  4. Yet, Plaintiffs did nothing at that time and insisted that their claims still had merit.  \n\nPage 2 of 5\n2017 U.S. DIST. CT. MOTIONS LEXIS 102173, *2\n  5. Five years later, this Court conducted a conference during which the Defendants again reiterated that Florence \nbarred the Plaintiffs' claims in this matter. Plaintiffs still insisted that their claims had merit and that they should be \nentitled to the opportunity to \"amend\" [*3]  their complaint to reflect the purportedly still-meritorious aspect of their \nclaims.  \n  6. As a result of Plaintiffs' conduct, Defendants were required to file an extensive summary judgment motion \nrehashing the voluminous discovery that was conducted in this matter over a decade ago. See Docket No. 301.2  \n  7. Plaintiffs also proceeded (past the Court's deadline) to file their motion for leave to amend their complaint, \nasserting theories of liability that (a) could have been asserted when  \n  2 Defendants filed their motion pursuant to the Court's scheduling order and have otherwise complied with every \ndeadline set by the Court. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, have not met one deadline set by the Court and have \nrepeatedly sought extensions at the 11th hour and/or proceeded without direction from the Court.  \n  this matter was filed thirteen (13) years ago in 2004 and (b) were without merit in any event based on well-settled \nlaw. See Docket No. 303.  \n  8. Defendants opposed Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend, demonstrating the utter lack of merit to Plaintiffs' \nproposed amendments as well as demonstrating the undue delay on the part of Plaintiffs in failing to seek timely \namendment [*4]  of their complaint and the prejudice that would result to Defendants if Plaintiffs were permitted to \nfile (an albeit baseless) amended complaint thirteen years after this action was commenced and over ten years \nafter discovery was completed. See Docket No. 305.  \n  9. Plaintiffs had five years after Florence in which they could have decided that their case was without merit. They \ndid absolutely nothing during that time to either prosecute or dismiss their claims. Instead, they let this action sit and \nwhen Defendants asserted that the case should be dismissed based on Florence, Plaintiffs insisted that their claims \nwere still meritorious and required the Defendants, and the Court, to expend additional time and resources on this \nmeritless action.  \n  10. Plaintiffs admit that they now seek to have the Court dismiss this action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. (\"FRCP\") \n41(a)(2) so that they can avoid the statute of limitations bar and commence a totally new action in New York State \ncourt asserting an entirely new claim pursuant to the New York State Constitution - a claim that was never \npreviously asserted in this action.  \n  See Extebank v Finkelstein, 188 AD2d 513, 513 (2d Dept 1992) (holding that a dismissal by court order pursuant \nto FRCP Rule [*5]  41(a)(2) does not constitute a \"voluntary discontinuance\" under New York CPLR §) 205(a), \nthereby allowing a plaintiff a six month grace period under New York law to file a new action); Censor v Mead \nReinsurance Corp., 176 AD2d 600, 601 (1st  \n  Dept 1991)(same).  \n  11. The point is worth reiterating - in the thirteen (13) years that this case has been pending, Plaintiffs never \nsought to raise any claims under New York state law until they filed their motion for leave to amend their complaint \nless than a month ago.  \n  12. Plaintiffs could have asserted a state law claim at the time they filed their complaint in 2004, after discovery \nwas substantially completed in 2006, or at any time during the eight years that this action was pending before \nFlorence.  \n  13. Plaintiffs chose not to include such a claim when they filed this action and chose not to amend their complaint \nwhen they had ample opportunity to do so.  \n  14. The law and the facts of this case do not, and should not, afford Plaintiffs the ability to avoid the consequences \nof their decisions.  \n\nPage 3 of 5\n2017 U.S. DIST. CT. MOTIONS LEXIS 102173, *5\n  15. As an initial matter, as discussed in detail in Defendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend \ntheir complaint (Docket No. 305), the state law claims that Plaintiffs [*6]  now seek to assert are without precedence \nor merit. No New York court has made any ruling concerning strip searches of inmates being admitted to a \ncorrectional facility.  \n  16. Rather, the vast body of case law that has developed in this area has been in the federal arena - and, with and \nfollowing Florence, that body of law has been significantly clarified.  \n  17. Regardless, a dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) is left to the Court's discretion and it is not in any way \nautomatic. See Shady Records, Inc. v. Source Enters., 371 F. Supp. 2d 394 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); Hinfin Realty Corp. v. \nPittston Co., 206 F.R.D. 350 (E.D.N.Y. 2002); Manners v. Fawcett Publications, Inc., 85 F.R.D. 63 (S.D.N.Y. 1979).  \n  18. More particularly, as stated in Hinfin, \"[t]he decision whether to grant a motion for voluntary dismissal rests \nwith the sound discretion of the trial court.\" 206 F.R.D. at 355, citing, inter alia, Catanzano v. Wing, 277 F.3d 99, \n109 (2d Cir. 2001).  \n  19. The motion should not be granted where it would result in prejudice to the defendant. Id. In considering \nwhether the defendant would be prejudiced, the court can consider a number of factors, including: (1) the plaintiff's \ndiligence in bringing the motion; (2) any \"undue vexatiousness\" on the plaintiff's part; (3) the extent to which the \ncase has progressed, including the defendant's efforts and expense in preparation for trial; (4) the duplicative \nexpense of relitigation; and, (5) the [*7]  adequacy of the plaintiff's explanation for a need to dismiss.\" Id. citing \nCatanzano, 277 F.3d at 100; D'Alto v. Dahon California, Inc., 100 F.3d 281, 283 (2d Cir. 1996); Zagano v. Fordham \nUniv., 900 F.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir. 1990).  \n  20. Applying these factors to this action demonstrates that Plaintiff's motion should absolutely be denied, and the \nCourt should proceed with determining the pending motions (Defendants' motion for summary judgment and \nPlaintiffs' motion for leave to amend its complaint) on their merits.3  \n  21. Plaintiffs were not diligent in bringing this motion. As stated above, Plaintiffs had five years since Florence to \nbring this motion. Not only did Plaintiffs not bring the motion during those five years, but, even when Defendants \ninsisted that Florence resolved this matter,  \n  3 Resolution of these motions should be simple and straightforward given that Plaintiffs have now admitted that \ntheir claims are without merit. However, in the unlikely event that the Court is inclined to grant Plaintiffs' motion for \nvoluntary dismissal, Defendants respectfully request that the Court also award Defendants their costs and fees \nassociated with the defense of this matter. See Hinfin, supra, at 357 (\"Where a plaintiff successfully dismisses a suit \nwithout prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2), courts often [*8]  grant the defendant an award of costs or fees...The \npurpose of such awards is generally to reimburse the defendant for the litigation costs incurred, in view of the risk \n(often the certainty) faced by the defendant that the same suit will be refiled and will impose duplicative expenses \nupon him.\") (internal citations omitted). While, for all of the reasons set forth herein, the Court should deny this \nmotion and proceed with a substantive determination dismissing this actions on its merits, should the Court decided \nto grant the motion, Defendants request that the Court set a separate date for Defendants to submit an application \ndetailing their costs and fees of this litigation to be reimbursed.  \n  Plaintiffs insisted that their claims had merit and forced Defendants to file not only a motion for summary judgment \nbut also opposition to their motion for leave to amend their complaint. This is the opposite of diligence, and also \nleads directly to the second factor.  \n  22. Plaintiffs' conduct is vexatious and harassing. Again, rather than concede the inevitable consequences of \nFlorence five years ago, Plaintiffs persisted in a course of action that caused Defendants to expend substantial [*9]  \nadditional time and resources defending claims that Plaintiffs knew were without merit. Because of such conduct by \nthe Plaintiffs, over the past four months, Defendants have had to scour through the immense record in this matter \n(over 30 depositions and thousands of pages of records) to prepare a summary judgment motion and opposition to \nPlaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint.  \n\nPage 4 of 5\n2017 U.S. DIST. CT. MOTIONS LEXIS 102173, *9\n  23. All of this additional time and effort could have been avoided if the Plaintiffs had been diligent and reasonable \nfive years ago when the Court directed the parties to determine the impact of Florence and agree on a path forward. \nAgain, Plaintiffs would not agree to dismiss their claims at that time and insisted that they should be permitted to \nproceed with the litigation.  \n  See Docket Nos. 293 and 294.4  \n  24. The third factor - the extent to which the case has progressed including the defendants' efforts and expense in \npreparing for trial - also weighs against voluntary dismissal.  \n  Discovery is complete - and has been complete since 2006. Defendants have filed their motion for summary \njudgment - again, as a direct result of Plaintiffs' conduct and insistence on pursuing their claims. [*10]  Defendants \nhave expended substantial time and resources in preparing this matter for disposition over the course of years of \nactive and heavy litigation.  \n  4 These submissions were made at the request of the Court in the aftermath of Florence and the Plaintiffs \ncertainly could have agreed to dismiss their claims at that time - especially since absolutely nothing has changed in \nterms of this case and the directly applicable law since then. However, Plaintiffs refused to do so and insisted that \nthe matter should proceed.  \n  25. The fourth factor - expense of relitigation - also weighs against granting the motion. Plaintiffs admit that they \nintend on using the voluntary dismissal of this action as a means to avoid the statute of limitations and commence a \nnew action in New York State court.  \n  This would require Defendants to expend further significant time and resources to defend the new action.5 This is \nparticularly relevant in this case because, as previously stated, Plaintiffs could have included a state law cause of \naction in their original complaint in 2004. They did not, and are now attempting to use this motion to circumvent their \nlack of diligence.  \n  26. The final factor - [*11]  adequacy of Plaintiffs' explanation - also weighs against the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' \nexplanation is disingenuous and hollow. Plaintiffs are not seeking dismissal based on their timely and good faith \nassessment that their claims lack merit. Plaintiffs are only seeking voluntary dismissal as a last ditch effort to abuse \na New York law loophole so that they can bring a completely new state court action based on a claim that they \nnever asserted in the 13 years this matter has been pending.  \n  27. As stated above and set forth in detail in Defendants' opposition to Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend \n(Docket No. 305), Plaintiffs could have asserted a claim based on the New York State Constitution when this action \nwas commenced in 2004 or at any time thereafter.  \n  There has been no change in New York law or in the facts of this matter that somehow made the New York State \nConstitution relevant now rather than in 2004.  \n  28. Rather, the Plaintiffs' sole purpose in seeking voluntary dismissal now - after Defendants have moved for \nsummary judgment and after Defendants have submitted their  \n  5 As also set forth in Defendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint, [*12]  \nDefendants would suffer gross and significant prejudice if they were forced to defend a new lawsuit based on a new \ntheory when the events occurred well over a decade ago and witnesses have, in some instances, moved on, \nretired, or died. See Docket No. 305, and more specifically, Docket No. 305-2, which is an affidavit from Defendant \nTimothy Howard discussing the numerous witnesses who are no longer available.  \n  opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend - is so that Plaintiffs can abuse the grace period of CPLR 205 to \nbring a meritless and untimely action in New York State Court.  \n  29. Based  on  all  of  the factors  identified  above,  Plaintiffs  should not  be  permitted to  abuse a  procedural \ntechnicality to avoid an ultimate, and necessary, conclusion to this over a decade-old litigation.  \n\nPage 5 of 5\n2017 U.S. DIST. CT. MOTIONS LEXIS 102173, *12\n  30. Indeed, New York law does not countenance this sort of abuse of CPLR 205: \"The restorative provisions of \nCPLR 205(a)...reflect the idea that a diligent litigant who commenced a timely action but who failed on some \ngenerally technical ground, deserves an adjudication on the merits.\" See, e.g., Matter of Winston v Freshwater \nWetlands Appeals Bd., 224 AD2d 160, 164 (2d Dept 1996).  \n  31. Plaintiffs' claims here are not subject to dismissal \"on some generally technical ground.\" [*13]   \n  32. Rather, Plaintiffs' claims in this action are subject to dismissal on the merits based on the now-settled law from \nthe United States Supreme Court and the extensive record developed over the course of more than a decade of \nlitigation.  \n  33. Defendants have spent years and substantial resources defending this matter and, after 13 years, are entitled \nto their adjudication of these claim ON THE MERITS to finally put to rest the claims that Plaintiffs brought against \nthem. Defendants are entitled to an adjudication that will end this matter once and for all, and that will not permit the \nPlaintiffs to disingenuously pursue an entirely new action in New York State Court over thirteen years after the \nevents at issue in this matter.  \n  34. Plaintiffs are not and have not been the \"diligent litigants\" that either FRCP Rule 41(a) or CPLR §)205(a) are \nintended to protect.  \n  35. The Court should refuse to countenance Plaintiffs' gamesmanship and determine, on the merits, Defendants' \npending motion for summary judgment and Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint on the merits.  \n  36. The Plaintiffs should not be rewarded for further unpermitted and unnecessary delay.  \n  37.

Huggins (hereinafter the \"Defendants\"), will and hereby do move for an order of the Court \ngranting them summary judgment and dismissing the Plaintiffs' Complaint in its entirety as a matter of law.  \n  The Defendants' are entitled to judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56 \nand the United States Supreme Court's decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of \nBurlington, 566 US 318, 132 S. Ct 1510 (2012), which overruled the very legal theory upon which Plaintiffs' action \nwas based. Defendants' policies and practices at issue - concerning \"strip searches\" of detainees arrested for \nmisdemeanors and other minor crimes upon their admission to the County correctional facilities -were constitutional \nas a matter of law prior to Florence. However, even accepting as true the evidence and allegations relied upon by \nPlaintiffs, Florence made clear that it is constitutionally permissible to conduct a \"strip search\" of a detainee upon \nadmittance to a correctional facility  \n  regardless of the criminal charges asserted against the detainee. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs' claims are without \nbasis in fact or in law, [*2]  and must be dismissed.  \n  This motion is based on this Motion, Defendants' Rule 56 Statement of Facts, dated August 25, 2017, the \nAppendix to Defendants' Rule 56 Statement of Facts with Exhibits A through 25, dated August 25, 2017, and \nMemorandum of Law, dated August 25, 2017.  \n  DATED: August 25, 2017  \n  Respectfully submitted,  \n  BARCLAY DAMON LLP  \n  By:  \n  /s James P.

Board  of  Chosen \nFreeholders, 132 S.Ct. 1510 (2012), on the present litigation.  The Plaintiffs acknowledge, and \nare willing to stipulate, that the Supreme Court’s decision in Florence has a major effect on this \nlitigation and the claims raised by the certified class.  The strip search regimen put in place by \nthe Erie County Sheriff’s Department falls squarely within the confines of the Florence decision, \nwith one major exception.  Specifically, Erie County only strip searched individuals that were \nadmitted into the Erie County Holding Center (“ECHC”) and Erie County Correctional Facility \n(“ECCF”) after they had been arraigned and held for a significant period of time to enable them \nto post bail.  The strip searches in question were done when individuals entered the general jail \npopulation, similar to those addressed in Florence. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 289   Filed 05/14/12   Page 2 of 4\n  The one issue for the Court to address now, however, is not insignificant.  Unlike the \nsearches addressed in Florence, Erie County’s searches where done in a group setting.  In the \nECHC, class members were searched in groups of three in a shower area.  In the ECCF, class \nmembers were searched in larger groups in a large common room.  One class member deposed in \nthis case was strip searched in front of two other women while she menstruated.   Two former \nErie County employees admit conducting these searches in groups.  Another District Court has \nfound that group strip searches are unconstitutional even after the Ninth Circuit ruled, like \nFlorence,  that  blanket  searches  of  misdemeanor  pre-trial  detainees  were  permissible.    See, \nRoadhouse v. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Dep’t, No. 2:09-CV-33, 2010 WL 3154550, * 2 \n(August 6, 2010, D. Nevada) (“The second contention underlying the Fourth Amendment claim \nstates a plausible right to relief.  The privacy afforded a detainee during a strip search may be a \nsignificant factor in determining the procedure’s constitutionality”).   \n  The Supreme Court expressly limited its holding to the exact facts addressed in the \nFlorence action, and further detailed that the holding did not address “concerns about instances \nof officers engaging in intentional humiliation and other abusive practices.”  Florence, 132 S.Ct. \nat 1523.  The concurrences from Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito further detailed that \nDistrict Courts should carefully consider the Florence holding to “leave open the possibility of \nexceptions.”  Id. (concurring opinion) (Robert, CJ).   The Florence decision does not provide \ncorrections officials with carte blanche to do as they please.  Instead, it is addressed to a limited \nset of circumstances that did not consider the legality of group strip searches.  For most class \nmembers, being strip searched legally is bad enough; being forced to disrobe and manipulate \nyour genitals in front of other detainees in the absence of any privacy is the hallmark of \nunreasonableness – especially when one is charged with a misdemeanor or other minor crime.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:04-cv-00534-RJA-HBS   Document 289   Filed 05/14/12   Page 3 of 4\nThe Plaintiffs note for the Court that even state prisons, which house individuals convicted of \nserious felony offenses, many of which involve violence, provide inmates with privacy when \nconducting otherwise permissible strip searches.  \n  The Plaintiffs had hoped to work with the Defendants to address the most direct way, \nprocedurally, to get these issues before the Court.  Rather than work with the Plaintiffs in this \nregard, the Defendants chose to make lengthy arguments, many of which are unnecessary, in the \nabsence of an appropriate record or motion practice.  The Plaintiffs will not reciprocate.  Instead, \nthe Plaintiffs seek a conference with the Court to address procedural issues in this action, and the \nmechanism by which the remaining issues in this case can be promptly and efficiently considered \nby the Court.  The Plaintiffs respectfully suggest that a short period of discovery, addressed only \nto group searches, followed by cross-motions for leave to file an amended complaint, for leave to \namend the class definition, and for summary judgment is the appropriate course that this action \nshould take going forward.   \n  The Plaintiffs did not consider the Court’s request for a brief submission on these issues \nto be a call for full motion submissions.  The Plaintiffs respectfully request that any action taken \nby the Court be the subject of appropriate motion practice to ensure them a full opportunity to be \nheard, and a full factual record.  The Plaintiffs thank the Court for its consideration of this \nsubmission.     \nRespectfully Submitted By: \n            /s Elmer Robert Keach, III \n            ______________________________ \nDated:  May 14, 2012       Elmer Robert Keach, III \n            LAW OFFICES OF ELMER ROBERT \n                KEACH, III, PC \n            1040 Riverfront Center \n            P.
