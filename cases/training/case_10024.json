Oklahoma.\nDecember 17, 1991.\n1554 *1554 Norman P. McDonald, Oklahoma City, Okl., for plaintiff.\nReginald D. Gaston, Jamie J. McGraw, Dist. Attorney's Office, Norman, Okl., John M. Jacobsen, Dist. Attorney's\nOffice, Oklahoma City, Okl., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nCAUTHRON, District Judge.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAt issue is defendant John Walsh's motion for summary judgment filed November 19, 1991. Plaintiff Dacre Beth\nDraper responded on November 27, 1991. This case involves allegations of an illegal strip search of plaintiff\nfollowing her arrest for public intoxication and subsequent detention at the Cleveland County Detention Center.\nThis case is set on this Court's March 1992 trial docket.\nII. STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nThe facts presented to the court upon a motion for summary judgment must be construed in a light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Board of Educ. v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 864, 102 S.Ct. 2799, 2806-07, 73\nL.Ed.2d 435 (1982); United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962). If there can\nbe but one reasonable conclusion as to the material facts, summary judgment is appropriate. Only genuine\ndisputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the\nentry of summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202\n(1986). Finally, the movant must show entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Ellis v. El Paso Natural Gas\nCo., 754 F.2d 884, 885 (10th Cir.1985); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).\nAlthough the Court must view the facts and inferences drawn from the record in a light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party, \"even under this standard there are cases where the evidence is so weak that the case does\nnot raise a genuine issue of fact.\" Burnette v. Dow Chem. Co., 849 F.2d 1269, 1273 (10th Cir.1988). As stated by\nthe Supreme Court, \"[s]ummary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as a disfavored procedural\nshortcut, but rather as an integral part of the Federal Rules as a whole, which are designed `to secure the just,\nspeedy and inexpensive determination of every action.'\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327, 106 S.Ct.\n2548, 2555, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 1).\nThe Supreme Court articulated the standard to be used in summary judgment cases, emphasizing the\n\"requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 248,\n106 S.Ct. at 2510 (emphasis in original). A dispute is \"genuine\" \"if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\nnonmoving party.\" Id. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510. The Court stated that the question is \"whether the evidence\n\npresents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party\n1555 must prevail as a matter of law.\" Id. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. at 2512. \"The mere existence of a scintilla of *1555\nevidence in support of the [party's] position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could\nreasonably find for the [party].\" Id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512.\nIII. UNDISPUTED FACTS\nRule 14(B) of the Western District of Oklahoma provides a framework for determining undisputed facts at the\nsummary judgment stage. The Rule provides:\nThe brief in support of a motion for summary judgment (or partial summary judgment) shall begin\nwith a section that contains a concise statement of material facts as to which movant contends no\ngenuine issue exists. The facts shall be numbered and shall refer with particularity to those\nportions of the record upon which movant relies. The brief in opposition to a motion for summary\njudgment (or partial summary judgment) shall begin with a section which contains a concise\nstatement of material facts as to which the party contends a genuine issue exists. Each fact in\ndispute shall be numbered, shall refer with particularity to those portions of the record upon which\nthe opposing party relies, and, if applicable, shall state the number of the movant's fact that is\ndisputed. All material facts set forth in the statement of the movant shall be deemed admitted for\nthe purpose of summary judgment unless specifically controverted by the statement of the\nopposing party.\nW.D.Okla.R. 14(B).\nA review of Walsh's brief and Draper's response reveals that the following facts are undisputed within the\nmeaning of Rule 14(B) for the purposes of this motion only:\n1. Probable cause existed to arrest Dacre Beth Draper on or about February 23, 1990, on the charge of public\nintoxication while she was an occupant in a vehicle being operated in the county of Cleveland County, State of\nOklahoma.\n2. Draper is not contesting the fact that there was probable cause for her arrest on or about February 23, 1990.\n3. Subsequent to Draper's arrest, she was brought to the Cleveland County Detention Center in Cleveland\nCounty, State of Oklahoma, at approximately 1:30 a.m., February 23, 1990.\n4. Draper was unable to post bond in her own behalf when she was brought to the Cleveland County Detention\nCenter.\n5. Draper was given the opportunity while at the Cleveland County Detention Center to place two phone calls.\nOne call was completed. Records indicate that the call was placed approximately 8:17 a.m. on February 23,\n1990. Records also indicate that Draper refused to place a second call, although given the opportunity.\n6. When an arrestee is placed in the Cleveland County Detention Center, precautions are taken to insure the\nsafety of the arrestee, along with jail personnel and other detainees in the Center. The precaution may involve\nstrip searching the arrestee in order to maintain the security of the Center and insure the safety of all persons\nconfined in the facility and the jail personnel.\n7. The procedure for strip searching arrestees who are brought into the Cleveland County Detention Center and\ncannot post immediate bond for a bondable offense entails having only female jail personnel conduct strip\nsearches of female arrestees, in an area segregated from view of all other arrestees, with no touching of the\narrested person by jail personnel.\n8. The strip search policy of the Cleveland County Detention Center is designed to maintain security in the facility\nand is conducted in a manner involving the least amount of personal intrusion, in a segregated place involving\njust the person being searched and jail personnel of the same gender.\n\n9. Because of the relatively long period of detainment of Draper in the Center, such being approximately seven\nand a half hours, it became necessary to process her into the facility, classify her, and begin the procedure to\nmove her upstairs to an area intermingling pretrial detainees and convicted persons.\n1556 10. Prior to moving an individual from the booking area to the upstairs holding *1556 cells, strip searches are\nconducted in order to maintain security of the facility and insure the safety of jail personnel, the person being\nmoved upstairs, and other detainees.\n11. At all times connected with this lawsuit, Sheriff John Walsh was functioning in his official capacity as Sheriff of\nCleveland County, State of Oklahoma.\n12. At no time did Walsh personally participate in the actual arrest, booking, search, or detainment of Draper.\n13. At no time did Walsh act with ill will, malice, or a desire to injure plaintiff's constitutional rights.\n14. Kenneth Zane, Cleveland County Detention Center Jail Administrator, has attested that during his\nemployment at the Center, various items of contraband have been brought into the Center by arrestees and\nfound during security checks.\n15. Records kept by the Cleveland County Detention Center in the normal course of business operation indicate\nand detail that contraband has been concealed and carried into the Center by arrestees and in many occasions,\ncontraband is found on the persons or inside the Center. Walsh's brief at 1-3 (Nov. 19, 1991); Draper's response\nbrief at 1-2 (unnumbered) (Nov. 27, 1991).\nIV. ANALYSIS\nWalsh moves for summary judgment based on a qualified immunity defense. See Snell v. Tunnell, 920 F.2d 673,\n696-97 (10th Cir.1990) (discussing qualified immunity defense), cert. denied sub nom.,___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct.\n1622, 113 L.Ed.2d 719 (1991); Coen v. Runner, 854 F.2d 374, 377 (10th Cir.1988) (discussing standard for\ngranting summary judgment based on qualified immunity). The Court's task is a fact-specific legal inquiry: \"Do the\nfacts alleged by the plaintiff[] support a violation of clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\nreasonable person would have known.\" Snell v. Tunnell, 920 F.2d at 696; see Meade v. Grubbs, 841 F.2d 1512,\n1533 (10th Cir.1988) (the issue is whether the law was clearly established when the conduct complained of\noccurred). The facts in this case were not disputed by Draper pursuant to W.D.Okla.R. 14(B) as noted in the\nprevious section. However, the Court sua sponte finds some genuine disputes of material facts as fully developed\nbelow. After considering these facts the Court finds that the law was clearly established at the time Draper was\nstrip searched on February 23, 1990, that a reasonable official would know under the circumstances that her\nsearch violated her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. U.S. Const. amends. IV & XIV. The Fourth\nAmendment only prohibits unreasonable searches; however, with certain exceptions \"[w]arrantless searches are \nper se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\" United States v. Lopez, 777 F.2d 543, 550 (10th Cir.1985)\n(citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)). Walsh must show\nthat his actions were objectively reasonable in light of the law and the information he possessed at the time. \nCoen v. Runner, 854 F.2d at 377.\nSeven years ago the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals found 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 liability when a detainee was strip\nsearched after being jailed for an unpaid speeding ticket and violation of a driver's license restriction. Hill v.\nBogans, 735 F.2d 391, 392-95 (10th Cir.1984); see generally Annotation, Fourth Amendment As Prohibiting Strip\nSearches Of Arrestees Or Pretrial Detainees, 78 A.L.R.Fed. 201, 216-19, ยง 6[b] (1986) & Supp. at 8-9 (1990).\nThe Tenth Circuit found that there were no circumstances in that case that indicated the detainee might possess\neither a weapon or drugs, and that intermingling with the prison population was only one factor to consider in\njudging the constitutionality of a strip search. Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d at 394.\nIn the present case the Cleveland County Detention Center has instituted a policy of indiscriminate strip\nsearching of all prisoners with total disregard to the constitutional mandates of the Fourth Amendment, which\ncondones only reasonable searches. See Walsh's brief at Ex. A, p. 4, ยถ 11 (Nov. 19, 1991) (Cleveland County\n\n1557 Sheriff's Department *1557 Admissions Procedure, No. 24.01 (Aug. 1, 1982)) (Detention Deputy \"[w]ill inspect\nprisoner and prisoner[']s clothing for contraband while conducting unclothed body search.\") (emphasis supplied).\n[1]\nAt the motion to dismiss stage, prior to the introduction of any evidence, this Court was undecided whether\nDraper's charge of public intoxication could be included as an offense where strip searching is per se permissible\nsuch as those associated with the concealment of weapons or contraband in a body cavity. See Order Granting\nMotion To Dismiss And Denying Motion To Strike at 2 (W.D.Okla. Sept. 4, 1991); see also Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520, 523-24, 558-59, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1866, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (finding that visual body cavity\nsearches of correctional inmates did not violate the Fourth Amendment because of serious security dangers and\nthe smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband among inmates with more serious offenses than\nminor traffic offenses who were unable to make bail, awaiting trial for substantial periods, and who were returning\nfrom contact visits outside the institution).\nHowever, in Hill v. Bogans the Tenth Circuit noted that it agreed with the analysis of the Fourth Circuit in Logan v.\nShealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981),cert. denied sub nom.,455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653\n(1982). The Tenth Circuit quoted Logan v. Shealy for its analysis in holding unconstitutional the practice of strip\nsearching a detainee charged with driving while intoxicated:\n\"On the undisputed and stipulated evidence, Logan's strip search bore no such discernible\nrelationship to security needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the ultimate\ninvasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably be thought justified. At no time would\nLogan or similar detainees be intermingled with the general jail population; her offense, though not\na minor traffic offense, was nevertheless one not commonly associated by its very nature with the\npossession of weapons or contraband; there was no cause in her specific case to believe that she\nmight possess either; and when strip-searched, she had been at the Detention Center for one and\none-half hours without even a pat-down search. An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely\napplied to detainees such as Logan along with all other detainees cannot be constitutionally\njustified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security consideration.\"\nHill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d at 394 (emphasis supplied) (quoting Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d at 1013). The Tenth\nCircuit embraced the quoted analysis in Logan v. Shealy, which found that driving while intoxicated is not an\noffense that, without more, permits indiscriminate strip searching. Therefore, this Court concludes that public\nintoxication by alcohol, which is a less serious offense than driving while intoxicated, is likewise an offense not\n1558 commonly associated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband.[2]Cf. Lusby v. T.G.*1558\n& Y. Stores, Inc., 749 F.2d 1423, 1434 (10th Cir.1984) (\"A strip search is not improper when a suspect is going to\nbe placed in the general jail population and has been charged with a drug offense such as possession of\nmarijuana.\") (emphasis supplied), vacated sub nom. and remanded for reconsideration on other grounds, Lawton\nv. Lusby, 474 U.S. 805, 106 S.Ct. 40, 88 L.Ed.2d 33 (1985),reaffirmed on remand, 796 F.2d 1307, 1313 (10th\nCir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 884, 107 S.Ct. 275, 93 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986).\nMoreover, while the Fourth Circuit in Logan v. Shealy was persuaded in part by the fact that the detainee in that\ncase was not intermingled with the general detention center population that included convicted offenders, the\nTenth Circuit in Hill v. Bogans, as noted above, did not find that factor to be conclusive as to whether strip\nsearching was permissible, but rather \"only one factor to consider in judging the constitutionality of a strip\nsearch.\" Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d at 394; see Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d at 1013 (quoted above). It is undisputed\nin this case that Draper was taken to an area in the Detention Center where detainees are intermingled with\n[3]\nconvictees.  The Court's task is to balance the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal\nrights that the search entails. This consideration involves the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in\nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. Hill v. Bogans, 735\nF.2d at 393-94.\nDraper was subjected to a visual strip search, and it is undisputed that it was conducted in a manner involving the\nleast amount of personal intrusion, in a segregated place involving just the person being searched and jail\n\npersonnel of the same sex and not in the view of any other arrestees, with no touching of the arrested person by\n[4]\njail personnel.  The place of the search was proper.\nHowever, with regard to the manner of the search, Walsh contends that the strip search was dignified. This\ncharacterization offends the Court's sensibilities. Second only to body cavity searches, strip searches are the\nmost debasing indignities to which American citizens are subjected by the government. In quick passing, a strip\n1559 search sounds innocuous enough, but on closer scrutiny it involves involuntary *1559 exposure and close\ninspection of the breasts, genitalia, and buttocks, as well as the unwelcome revelation of medical and other highly\n[5]\npersonal physical secrets to a cold stranger. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 558 n. 39, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 n. 39\n(\"If the inmate is a male, he must lift his genitals and bend over to spread his buttocks for visual inspection. The\nvaginal and anal cavities of female inmates also are visually inspected.\").\nThe visual strip search is not as intrusive as the body cavity search where the investigator penetrates the body\nsurface probing for contraband, but is certainly something less than the medical examinations in a clean, sterile\nenvironment to which Americans have become accustomed, and where privacy, confidentiality, and personal trust\nare respected and protected by law and professional licensing ethics. Strip searches can be described by a\nnumber of adjectives, but being dignified is not one of their number. Compare Levoy v. Mills, 788 F.2d 1437, 1439\n(10th Cir.1986) (body cavity searches are demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying,\nunpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, and signify degradation and submission; and perhaps are the greatest\npersonal indignity searching officials can visit upon an individual) with Cruz v. Finney County, Kan., 656 F.Supp.\n1001, 1004-06 (D.Kan.1987) (excellent survey of circuit opinions on strip-search law for detainees arrested for\ntraffic violations or minor offenses) (\"Strip searches involving the visual inspection of the anal and genital areas\nare `\"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive,\nsignifying degradation and submission....\"'\") (emphasis supplied) (quoting Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723\nF.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (in turn quoting Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 491 (E.D.Wis.1979),aff'd and\nop. adopted per curiam,620 F.2d 160, 161 (7th Cir.1980))); cf. also Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 576-77, 594, 99\nS.Ct. at 1893-94, 1903 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"the body cavity searches ... represent one of the most grievous\noffenses against personal dignity and common decency.\" \"The body-cavity search 00 clearly the greatest personal\n97\nindignity 00 may be the least justifiable measure of all the security practices in the institution.\"); Doe v. Renfrow,\n97\n631 F.2d 91, 93 (7th Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (strip search of a minor student absent reasonable cause violates\n\"any known principle of human decency\" and \"exceed[s] the `bounds of reason' by two and a half country\nmiles.\").\nThe Court is genuinely concerned with the manner, scope and necessity for the strip search under the\ncircumstances of this case. Draper was detained for less than eight hours for the petty offense of public\nintoxication, and although she could not immediately bond out of jail due to the lack of funds on her person, there\nwas a reasonable likelihood that she could make bond within a relatively short period of time as she made a\nphone call and arranged bond when she was first given the opportunity at 8:17 a.m. on February 23, 1990; she\nrefused the second opportunity at 8:19 a.m., which was apparently unnecessary. Walsh's brief at Ex. B.\nDraper was also cooperative during her arrest and there is no indication that she possessed weapons or\ncontraband. The Fourth Amendment's mandates for reasonable searches are less restrictive on prisoners\nconvicted of crimes than for detainees, such as Draper, who have not even been arraigned, and are held merely\non a law enforcement officer's belief that there is probable cause for an arrest. At this stage of detention, and\nwhen the detainee is arrested for a petty offense, such as public intoxication, and there is no reasonable,\nindividualized suspicion that the detainee is hiding contraband or weapons, then the Fourth Amendment requires\n1560 that the detainee not be subjected to the humiliation of being totally stripped of all clothing *1560 while a\ngovernment agent visually inspects the naked body for contraband. See Levoy v. Mills, 788 F.2d 1437, 1439\n(10th Cir.1986) (\"`\"`[T]he greater the intrusion, the greater must be the reason for conducting a search.'\"'\")\n(quoting Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 565 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting United States v. Afanador, 567 F.2d 1325,\n1328 (5th Cir.1978) (in turn quoting United States v. Love, 413 F.Supp. 1122, 1127 (S.D.Tex.),aff'd,538 F.2d 898\n(5th Cir.),cert. denied,429 U.S. 1025, 97 S.Ct. 646, 50 L.Ed.2d 628 (1976)))); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,\n723 F.2d at 1273 (\"The more intrusive the search, the closer governmental authorities must come to\ndemonstrating probable cause for believing the search will uncover the objects for which the search is\n\nconducted.\") (citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 18 n. 15, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1878 n. 15, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)); Cruz\nv. Finney County, Kan., 656 F.Supp. at 1005 (\"reasonable suspicion may result from the `nature of the offense,\nthe arrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.'\") (quoting Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614,\n617 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (\"[W]e hold that arrestees charged with minor offenses may be subjected to a\nstrip search only if jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or\nconcealing contraband.\"), cert. denied,471 U.S. 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985)); cf. Levoy v. Mills,\n788 F.2d at 1439 (\"Given the procedural posture of this case, it would be premature for us to formulate what\nstandard of suspicion must exist before prison officials can conduct a body cavity search. For now, it suffices to\nsay that the government must demonstrate a legitimate need to conduct such a search and that less intrusive\nmeasures would not satisfy that need.\").\nWhile Walsh contends that there is a general necessity for strip searches, the clearly established law indicates\nthat, without more, such a concern is not enough to overcome the safeguards of the Fourth Amendment. See Hill\nv. Bogans, 735 F.2d at 394. Except for the nature of the suspects' offenses, which both are minor, and the places\nof the search 00 one in a public area, the other in a private area 00 this case is almost indistinguishable from the\n97 97\ncircumstances in Hill v. Bogans. The Court believes that the detention center's paramount interest in institutional\nsecurity in this case could have been satisfied by a clothed, pat-down search. See Levoy v. Mills, 788 F.2d at\n1439. Walsh has not convinced this Court that the intermingling of petty offense arrestees with convicted\noffenders was even necessary, much less prudent. Also, the institution could have explored the possibilities of\nrequiring arrestees to strip down only to underwear, or even consensual strip searches in return for the privilege\nof transfer into areas that provide more freedom, comfort, or other privileges.\nWith the exception of reducing the degree of the humiliating impact of the searches, Walsh has otherwise blindly\ndisregarded the lessons taught by Hill v. Bogans and has permitted a policy of indiscriminate strip searching,\nwhich encompasses the most minor traffic and petty offense arrestees. These persons are subjected to strip\nsearching before a judge has even determined if there is probable cause to support their charges and further\ndetention.\nEvery citizen who happens to enter the jurisdiction of Cleveland County is vulnerable to being subjected to this\npolicy at the discretion of a police officer's belief in probable cause for an arrest for a traffic violation or other\nminor offense. The Court finds that policy No. 24.01 of the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office is unconstitutional on\nits face. See Stewart v. Lubbock County, Tex., 767 F.2d 153, 155-57 (5th Cir.1985) (affirming permanent\ninjunction of unconstitutional across-the-board strip search of arrestees, including those charged with public\nintoxication), cert. denied,475 U.S. 1066, 106 S.Ct. 1378, 89 L.Ed.2d 604 (1986); accord Mary Beth G. v. City of\nChicago, 723 F.2d at 1273 (upholding finding that strip search policy was unreasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment). The Court therefore concludes that summary judgment cannot be granted on Walsh's qualified\nimmunity defense, which \"is available to police officers sued in their individual capacity when they could not\n1561 reasonably have known that their actions violated the law.\" Munz v. Ryan, 752 *1561 F.Supp. 1537, 1540\n(D.Kan.1990) (citing Ross v. Neff, 905 F.2d 1349, 1354 (10th Cir.1990)); see Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738-39, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (\"If the law was clearly established, the immunity\ndefense ordinarily should fail, since a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his\nconduct.\"); Melton v. City of Okla. City, 879 F.2d 706, 731 (10th Cir.) (\"[O]fficials are presumed to know and abide\nby clearly established law.\"), reh'g en banc granted in part on other grounds, 888 F.2d 724 (10th Cir.1989) (per\ncuriam), on reh'g en banc, 928 F.2d 920 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 296, 116 L.Ed.2d 241\n(1991).\nFinally, Walsh moves for summary judgment on Draper's claim for punitive damages. However, Draper contends,\ndespite failing to dispute the fact pursuant to W.D.Okla.R. 14(B), that Walsh deliberately acted with reckless\nindifference to her rights. Viewing the facts as noted above in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the\nCourt finds that it cannot grant summary judgment to Walsh on the punitive damages claim. See Munz v. Ryan,\n752 F.Supp. at 1548 (\"Punitive damages are available under ยง 1983 `when the defendant's conduct is shown to\n... involve[] reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.'\") (quoting Smith v. Wade,\n461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 1640, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983)); cf. Lavicky v. Burnett, 758 F.2d 468, 477 (10th\nCir.1985) (holding that arrogant ignorance of the applicable legal rules does not by itself indicate reckless or\n\ncallous indifference to federally protected rights, but within the context of an unlawful search of an automobile), \ncert. denied,474 U.S. 1101, 106 S.Ct. 882, 88 L.Ed.2d 917 (1986)).\nV. CONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the Court finds that summary judgment for defendant Walsh is DENIED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] The Court notes that in one of Oklahoma's sister states, Colorado, a search like the one conducted on Draper\nis statutorily prohibited. See Colo.Rev.Stat. ยง 16-3-405(1) (\"No person arrested for a traffic or a petty offense shall\nbe strip searched, prior to arraignment, unless there is reasonable belief that the individual is concealing a\nweapon or a controlled substance or that the individual, upon identification, is a parolee or an offender serving a\nsentence in any correctional facility in the state or that the individual is arrested for driving while under the\ninfluence of drugs.\"), quoted in Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d at 393 n. 1.\n[2] Draper's arrest report indicates that there was a \"strong odor of an alcoholic beverage about her person\"\nwhen she was arrested, and she otherwise exhibited symptoms of alcohol intoxication such as slurred, loud\nspeech; unsteady balance; and red-glossy eyes, as opposed to any distinguishing signs of drug intoxication, such\nas, for example, an odor of marijuana or needle marks, or rapid speech. See Walsh's brief at Ex. A (Nov. 19,\n1991). Draper was cooperative during her arrest and there was no indication of weapons or contraband\nassociated with her arrest. See id. Prior to her arrest Draper was a passenger in a car in which the driver was\narrested for driving under the influence, and Draper was abandoned following the arrest of the driver.\nSubsequently, Draper was arrested for public intoxication. Id.\nAs noted by Draper, her offense was merely the violation of Ordinance No. 15-302 of the City of Norman,\nOklahoma, and was not an offense under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. Walsh cites 21 Okla.Stat. ยง 11(B) to\nsupport his argument that Draper might have been confined for up to one day for her offense, but the applicability\nof that statute is suspect because it only applies to offenses in violation of state laws as opposed to municipal\nordinances. In any event it is undisputed that Draper was detained for only seven and a half hours, and the Court\nconcludes that Draper was detained for a petty offense.\n[3] The Court notes the incongruence of Walsh's position where on one hand he expresses a concern for security\ndue to the intermingling of short-term detainees with long-term convictees that requires indiscriminate strip\nsearching, but on the other hand he has exercised his discretion to practice such a policy in the first instance,\nwhich inherently creates the very security problem of which he is concerned. In any event, Walsh has not\nexpressed any institutional requirement that dictates such a suspect intermingling policy. The security of\nprisoners, staff, and the institution would be greatly enhanced if short-term detainees, such as Draper, who could\nnot post immediate bond for a bondable offense, but were reasonably likely to shortly make bond, were\nsegregated from inmates who are convicted of crimes. In this regard classification of prisoners is one of the\nprimary, discretionary, security measures that an institution official can make.\n[4] Draper \"contends\" in the most general way that her strip search was an affront to human dignity and that she\nwas physically touched by jail personnel during the strip search to which she was subjected. Draper's brief at 2\n(Nov. 27, 1991). However, a party resisting a motion for summary judgment must do more than make\nconclusionary allegations; that party \"must set forth facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\nFed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); Dart Indus. v. Plunkett Co., 704 F.2d 496, 498 (10th Cir.1983); see Lake Hefner Open Space\nAlliance v. Dole, 871 F.2d 943, 945-46 (10th Cir.1989) (Plaintiff did not \"by affidavits or as otherwise ... set forth \nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\") (emphasis supplied). \"The very mission of the\nsummary judgment procedure is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is\na genuine need for trial.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348,\n1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (quoting Advisory Committee Note to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)).\n[5] Certain persons may be more offended than others about exposing their unclothed bodies to governmental\nstrangers. For example, certain persons would be more highly susceptible to extreme emotional trauma from\n\nbeing strip searched who had physical deformities or amputations such as mastectomies, obvious venereal\ndiseases such as blisters from genital herpes, hemorrhoids, incontinence, obesity, or menses.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
