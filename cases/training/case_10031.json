    "summary": "<p>On June 2, 1999, the Plaintiff, a 29-year-old woman, filed a complaint against three Defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Defendants were the arresting officer, the officer that supervised the arresting officer, and the Town of Dumfries. The Plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Virginia state law. The Plaintiff alleged that the arresting officer's touching of her genitals in strip search fashion while arresting her constituted assault, battery, and unreasonable search. The Plaintiff was represented by private counsel, and the case was assigned to Judge Gerald B. Lee. The available court records do not reveal what relief the Plaintiff sought. </p><p>The Plaintiff was a 29 year-old resident of Dumfries and mother of five children. She lived with her husband and children. The Defendants were members of the Dumfries Police Department. One served as the supervising officer for the other, newly-commissioned officer. On August 12, 1997, the two officers arrested the Plaintiff at her residence pursuant to a valid arrest warrant for her violation of a local noise ordinance. The Plaintiff did not resist to the arrest, but asked if she may get dressed as she was wearing nothing underneath her night gown. However, the officers rejected this request. The arresting officer proceeded to search the Plaintiff before allowing her to enter the police car, running his hands over her hips and swiping across her groin area. The Plaintiff subsequently commenced this lawsuit, which was comprised of a seven-count complaint.</p><p>Between June 1999 and December 2000, the parties engaged in discovery.</p><p>In December 1999, all three Defendants moved for summary judgment. Judge Lee on January 13, 2000 granted their motion for summary judgment only for two Defendants: the Town of Dumfries and the supervising officer. He denied the motion with respect to the arresting officer. The arresting officer appealed this decision on January 24, 2000. The case was stayed pending the appeal. </p><p> </p><p>It is important to note the reasoning behind Judge Lee's decision. In a February 28, 2000 memorandum, Judge Lee explained that his main reason for denying the arresting officer's motion for summary judgment was that a reasonable officer in the arresting officer's position would not have conducted a vaginal search on the Plaintiff. By conducting such an intrusive search, the officer violated the Plaintiff's clearly established rights. Consequently, Judge Lee held that the officer is not entitled to a defense of qualified immunity. 87 F.Supp.2d 556.</p><p>Thus, the arresting officer remained the only Defendant on this case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on January 1, 2001 affirmed the above decision of the District Court. The Court of Appeals also remanded for further proceedings. Circuit Judge Karen J. Williams affirmed that: (1) the Plaintiff sufficiently alleged deprivation of constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search; and (2) the Plaintiff's right to be free from public, sexually intrusive search was clearly established, thereby precluding summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. 237 F.3d 356. </p><p>The jury trial was set to occur in April 2001. However, on March 26, 2001, the Plaintiff withdrew all claims including those for attorneys' fee and cost.

    "summary_short": "In June 1999, the Plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against three Defendants: 1) an officer who arrested her; 2) that officer's supervising officer; and 3) the municipality in which she resided. The Plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 and Virginia state law, claiming that the arresting officer's touching of her genitals in strip search fashion while arresting her constituted assault, battery, and unreasonable search. In January 2000, Judge Gerald B. Lee denied the arresting officer's Motion for Summary Judgment while granting that motion filed by the Municipality and the supervising officer. In February 2001, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed this decision, stating that the Plaintiff's right to be free from sexually intrusive search was clearly established and therefore denying the arresting officer's motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. The Plaintiff withdrew all claims in 2001, and the Court dismissed the case with prejudice. The case is closed. ",

Virginia, Alexandria Division.\nFebruary 28, 2000.\n555578 *557*558 Victor Michael Glasberg, Victor Glasberg & Associates, Alexandria, VA, for Plaintiff.\nJohn J. Brandt, Brandt, Jennings, Roberts, Davis & Snee, Falls Church, VA, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nLEE, District Judge.\nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court on Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on the five remaining\n[1]\ncounts of Plaintiff Lisa Amaechi's 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Complaint.  The case involves the constitutionality of an\nalleged body cavity search Defendant Officer Matthew West (\"Officer West\") conducted on Ms. Amaechi during\nthe enforcement of a magistrate-authorized arrest warrant by Defendants Officer West and Officer Bernard R.\nPfluger (\"Officer Pfluger\") of the Dumfries, Virginia Police Department. The Court, in its previous Order of January\n13, 2000, granted summary judgment on all three counts related to Officer Pfluger and Defendant Town of\n[2]\nDumfries, Virginia (\"Dumfries\"), but denied summary judgment on the two counts associated with Officer West.\nSee Order, Amaechi v. West, No. CIV.A. 99-783-A (E.D.Va. Jan. 13, 2000) (Lee, J.) (reserving the right to\nsupplement Order with Memorandum Opinion if appeal taken by either party). Defendants have since appealed\nthe denial of summary judgment with respect to the two counts against Officer West. Accordingly, the question\nbefore the Court is whether the alleged body cavity search conducted by Officer West on Ms. Amaechi was\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment such that Officer West is protected from her claims by the doctrine of\n[3]\nqualified immunity.  For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that the challenged search crossed evident\nFourth Amendment lines and, therefore, precludes Officer West from invoking the protection of qualified immunity.\nI. BACKGROUND\nIn August 1997, Ms. Amaechi was a twenty-nine year old resident of Dumfries, Virginia. She stood about 5'4\" tall\nand weighed around 135 pounds. She is the mother of five children who, in August 1997, ranged in age from four\nto eleven years old. At all times relevant to this controversy, Ms. Amaechi lived with her five children and her\nhusband, Mr. Oliver Amaechi (\"Mr. Amaechi\"), to whom she has been married since 1988. During this same time,\nOfficers Pfluger and West were members of the Dumfries Police Department, Pfluger serving as supervising\nofficer for the newly-commissioned \"auxiliary officer\" West.\nOn August 12, 1997, Officers Pfluger and West arrested Ms. Amaechi at her residence pursuant to a valid arrest\nwarrant alleging her violation of a local noise ordinance. Prior to the arrest, residents of the Amaechi household\n559 would occasionally *559 play music at high volume, thereby disturbing a neighbor living in the adjoining\ntownhouse. Such behavior inspired a series of noise complaints against the Amaechis by this neighbor, which\nculminated in a police visit to the Amaechi residence on August 10, 1997.\nAt around 10:00 a.m. on that day, Officer Steven Hargrave (\"Officer Hargrave\") of the Dumfries Police\nDepartment came to the Amaechi household and instructed Ms. Amaechi to turn down the volume of her radio.\nShe did so; but finding Officer Hargrave to be \"rude,\" she called the Prince William Police Department to\n\ncomplain of his behavior. Prince William Officer Mark Atkinson was dispatched to the scene to investigate. Upon\narrival, he suggested that the Amaechis mediate the noise dispute with their neighbor by using a county\nmediation service. Mr. Amaechi, who was also in the house at the time of the police visit, rejected the proposal.\nConsequently, two days after the noise incident, Officer Hargrave secured an arrest warrant charging Ms.\n[4]\nAmaechi with a misdemeanor violation of the Dumfries noise ordinance.\nIt is undisputed that Virginia law allows the issuance of a summons, as opposed to an arrest warrant, where there\nis reason to believe that a person charged with a misdemeanor will appear in the court having jurisdiction of the\noffense charged. See VA.CODE ANN. § 19.2-73 (Michie 1995). Nevertheless, the aforementioned arrest warrant\nwas given to Officer Pfluger and he, along with his trainee, Officer West, served it on August 12, 1997.\nAt about 9:30 p.m. that evening, Officer Pfluger knocked at the Amaechis' door. Mr. and Ms. Amaechi answered\nthe door together, at which time Officer Pfluger asked for Ms. Amaechi, told her that she was under arrest, and\nhandcuffed her. This all took place right inside the front door of the Amaechi home with Mr. Amaechi and the\nchildren watching. At the time Officer Pfluger knocked at the door, Ms. Amaechi was nude in her bathroom\nupstairs getting ready for bed. Upon hearing the knocking downstairs, she slipped on a \"light house dress\" that\nshe occasionally wore as a robe and followed her husband downstairs to answer the door. The house dress was\ndescribed in pleadings as a \"long wrap with spaghetti straps and buttonholes down the front.\" Most of the buttons\nwere missing, however, and, hence, the dress was buttoned at the top but open from the lower chest down.\nMs. Amaechi remained nude underneath the dress as she approached the front door. Neither she nor her\nhusband mounted any resistance or displayed a lack of cooperation during the arrest. Instead, they complied with\nall instructions promptly and efficiently 00 as documented in police reports created at the scene. Upon being\n97\nadvised that she was to be handcuffed and arrested on the spot, however, Ms. Amaechi did point out to the\nofficers that she was nude underneath the dress and would like permission to get dressed. Officer Pfluger denied\nthis request. The veteran policeman then proceeded with the initial arrest before handing Ms. Amaechi over to\n[5]\nOfficer West, a \"rookie\" with the Dumfries Police Department,  for the search incident to arrest.\nOfficer West walked Ms. Amaechi to his police car, which was parked in front of the row of town homes where the\nAmaechis lived 00 in plain view of neighborhood residents. On reaching the cruiser, whose back door Officer West\n97\nhad opened, Ms. Amaechi proceeded as though to enter the back seat. Officer West stopped her descent into the\n560 vehicle, however, informing her that he had to search her before she *560 entered the car. Ms. Amaechi\nprotested that she was wearing no clothes underneath the house dress. Nonetheless, Officer West proceeded to\nrun his hands over her hips, inside her now-opened dress. Moreover, with one hand palm-up, he allegedly swiped\n[6]\nacross her groin area, at which time the tip of his finger slightly penetrated her genitals.  Horrified, furious, and\nconfused, Ms. Amaechi purportedly jumped back, exclaiming that she had warned him she was wearing no\nundergarments. Officer West did not respond to her exclamation; rather, he completed his search and permitted\nher to enter the car.\nSoon thereafter, Ms. Amaechi filed a seven-count Complaint in federal district court, alleging that the touching of\nher genitals by Officer West in \"strip search\" fashion violated both the Fourth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, see generally 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 (West Supp. 1999), and Virginia state law (assault, battery, and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress). Two of the counts were dropped by Plaintiff during the course of the\nlitigation, see supra note 1, and, after oral argument, the Court granted summary judgment on the three counts\npertaining to Officer Pfluger and the Town of Dumfries. See Order, Amaechi v. West, No. CIV.A. 99-783-A\n(E.D.Va. Jan. 13, 2000) (Lee, J.). The Court denied summary judgment, however, with regard to the two counts\nlodged against Officer West, Counts V (unconstitutional search) and VI (assault and battery). See id. It is from\nthis denial that Defendants appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. See Defs.' Notice of Appeal at 1\n(filed Jan. 24, 2000).\n\nII. STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"FRCP\") 56, a court should grant summary judgment if the moving party\ndemonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. See FED. R.CIV.P. 56(c).\nOnce a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, the opposing party has the burden of\nshowing that a genuine dispute exists. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574,\n586-87, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The opposing party may not rest upon the mere allegations or\ndenials of her pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. See\nFED.R.CIV.P. 56(e).\nThe mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties, however, will not defeat an otherwise\nproperly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material\nfact. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A\ndispute is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. \nSee id. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. As to materiality, only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit\nunder the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. See id.\nIn determining whether a party is entitled to summary judgment, the record is viewed in the light most favorable to\nthe nonmoving party. See United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962).\nIII. ANALYSIS\nProcedurally speaking, there are genuine issues of material fact for trial here with regard to the counts against\nOfficer West. Insofar as the Court's denial of summary judgment on those claims is concerned, recognition of\n561 such genuine issues would normally be enough to support this *561 ruling 00 the analysis could, essentially, end\n97\nthere. See infra Part III.A. Nonetheless, because of the severity of the allegations here, the Court will also outline\nthe substantive legal reasons for denying Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the claims against Officer\nWest.\nA. Genuine Issues of Material Fact\nFirst, as the Court thoroughly articulated during oral argument on Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment,\nthere are obvious and genuine issues of material fact with regard to the claimed \"touching\" that took place during\nthe search of Ms. Amaechi by Officer West. Resolution of these issues is within the province of a fact-finding jury,\nnot that of the judge on a summary judgment motion. Cf. FED.R.CIV.P. 56. More importantly, the Court's\ndisposition denying summary judgment because of such genuine issues of material fact is not appealable in this\nmatter. See generally Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 311, 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995).\nAdmittedly, a district court's order denying a defendant's motion for summary judgment is an immediately\nappealable collateral order or \"final decision\" under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 when the defendant is a public official\nasserting qualified immunity 00 and the issue appealed involves not which facts the parties might be able to prove\n97\nbut, rather, whether or not certain given facts showed a violation of clearly established law. See id. at 311, 115\nS.Ct. 2151 (citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 528, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985)). In Johnson v.\nJones, however, the United States Supreme Court unambiguously held that not all denials of summary judgment\nin the context of a qualified immunity defense are appealable:\n[W]e hold that a defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a\ndistrict court's summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the\npretrial record sets forth a \"genuine\" issue of fact for trial.\nId. at 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151.\n\nSimply put, the Fourth Circuit has no jurisdiction over an appeal that involves the issue of whether or not certain\n[7]\nconduct occurred. See Winfield v. Bass, 106 F.3d 525, 529-30 (4th Cir.1997).\nThe issue of whether or not certain conduct occurred, however, is indeed the precise factual conundrum before\nthe Court 00 specifically, whether Officer West actually touched, swiped, felt, or entered Ms. Amaechi's genital\n97\narea during the search in question. This is the most blaring example of a genuine issue for trial. Officer West\ninsists that there was no such touching. See supra note 6. To the contrary, Ms. Amaechi contends that the search\nwas analogous in nature to a constitutionally violative \"strip\" or \"body cavity\" search, in that Officer West's finger\nentered her genitals during a search incident to an arrest based merely on her violation of a local noise\nordinance. See, e.g., Amaechi Decl. at 4. Under the circumstances, and after a thorough review of the record, the\nCourt finds that this disagreement over the conduct in question presents a genuine issue of material fact for trial\n562 to be determined by a jury. Given the Supreme Court precedent cited above, the issue would not be *562\n[8]\nappropriately adjudicated via summary judgment.\nOther genuine issues of material fact exist with regard to all of the following: (1) upon her arrest, whether Ms.\nAmaechi asked the officers if she could change into more suitable clothes for her transport to the police station;\n(2) what exactly Officer Pfluger instructed Officer West to do when he handed Ms. Amaechi over for a search\nincident to arrest; and (3) the actual intent of Officer West during the search of Ms. Amaechi. The resolution of\nthese issues would lend clear insight into the Fourth Amendment viability or \"reasonableness\" of the search in\nquestion 00 and the availability of a qualified immunity defense. Each involves a question of whether certain\n97\nconduct occurred and must, therefore, be resolved by the fact-finder at trial. Consequently, the Fourth Circuit has\nno jurisdiction to hear Defendants' appeal of this Court's denial of summary judgment on the claims against\nOfficer West.\nB. The Fourth Amendment and Qualified Immunity\nIn relevant part, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution secures the right of the people to protection from\n\"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. CONST. amend. IV. The doctrine of qualified immunity protects\ngovernment officials from civil damages in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 actions \"insofar as their conduct does not violate\nclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).\nThe Supreme Court recently set forth a two-part test for analyzing a claim of qualified immunity in the context of\nan alleged constitutional violation. See Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 1696-97, 143 L.Ed.2d 818\n(1999). The evaluating court must first ascertain whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual\nconstitutional right. See id. at 1697 (quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 119 S.Ct. 1292, 1295, 143 L.Ed.2d\n399 (1999)); see also Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); Taylor\nv. Waters, 81 F.3d 429, 433 (4th Cir.1996). If so, the court proceeds to determine whether that right was clearly\nestablished at the time of the alleged infringement. See Wilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1697 (quoting Conn, 119 S.Ct. at\n1295).\nIn order for a right to have been clearly established, \"the `contours of the right' must have been so conclusively\ndrawn as to leave no doubt that the challenged action was unconstitutional.\" Swanson v. Powers, 937 F.2d 965,\n969 (4th Cir.1991) (quoting Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034). Moreover, to determine whether a right\nwas clearly established at the time of the claimed violation, courts in this circuit need not look beyond the\n[9]\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit, and the highest court of the state in which the case arose.\nSee Wallace v. King, 626 F.2d 1157, 1161 (4th Cir.1980). Lastly, the Court must consider whether a reasonable\nperson in the official's position would have known that his conduct would violate the identified right. See \nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034; Taylor, 81 F.3d at 433.\nDeciding the constitutional question before the qualified immunity question in the manner prescribed by the\nSupreme Court \"promotes clarity in the legal standards for official conduct, to the benefit of both the officers and\n\nthe general public.\" See Wilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1697 (citing County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 842 n. 5,\n118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998)).\n563  1. The Constitutional Question\n*563\nGiven this precedent, and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that the alleged\nsearch incident to arrest conducted by Officer West violated Ms. Amaechi's Fourth Amendment right to a\nreasonable search, along with clearly established standards emanating from that right.\nThe constitutional prong of the qualified immunity analysis here raises the following query: whether the scope of a\npolice officer's authority under the Fourth Amendment to conduct a warrantless search of an arrestee incident to\na lawful arrest includes the authority to search the arrestee's body cavities. See generally Commonwealth v.\nGilmore, 27 Va.App. 320, 498 S.E.2d 464, 468 (1998). Balancing the needs of the particular search against the\ninvasion of the personal rights that the search entailed, see generally Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct.\n1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Court holds that it does not.\nGenerally speaking, searches conducted without the prior approval of a judge or magistrate are per se\n\"unreasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment. See Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19\nL.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (citations omitted). One of the established exceptions to the warrant requirement, however, is\nthe search incident to a lawful arrest. See United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 224, 226, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38\nL.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (holding that searches incident to arrest \"meet the Fourth Amendment's requirement of\nreasonableness\"). The Supreme Court has articulated the permissible scope of a warrantless search incident to\narrest, explaining that it authorizes the police to conduct a full search of the arrestee's person, see id. at 235, 94\nS.Ct. 467, along with the area within the arrestee's immediate control. See Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752,\n762-63, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). Officers conducting such a search may also seize the arrestee's\npersonal effects that are evidence of the crime. See United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 804-05, 94 S.Ct.\n1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974).\nBut the authority of the police under the Fourth Amendment to conduct a full search incident to arrest, without a\nwarrant, is only \"skin deep.\" See Gilmore, 498 S.E.2d at 468. The Supreme Court has stated, quite clearly, that\nthe considerations that justify the authority to search incident to a lawful arrest 00 protect officers from the\n97\nimmediate danger of concealed weapons and prevent destruction of evidence 00 \"have little applicability with\n97\nrespect to searches involving intrusions beyond the body's surface.\" Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 769,\n[10]\n86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966).  The warrant requirement of informed and detached consideration is\n[11]\n\"indisputable and great\" when officers seek to invade another's body for evidence incident to an arrest. See id.\n564 at 770, 86 S.Ct. 1826; cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 484, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971). \n*564 Moreover, the means and procedures employed by authorities conducting searches involving intrusions into\nthe body must also satisfy Fourth Amendment standards of reasonableness. See Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 768, 86\nS.Ct. 1826. Thus, searches incident to arrest are limited in nature to a pat-down and an examination of the\narrestee's pockets00absent exigent circumstances, they do not extend to strip searches or bodily intrusions. See\n97\ngenerally Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 616 (9th Cir.1984).\nWith this backdrop, the Court views the alleged penetration of Ms. Amaechi's genital area by Officer West during\nhis search incident to her arrest as intrusive in nature, analogous to an improper \"body cavity\" or \"strip\" search,\nand constitutionally unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. A review of applicable precedent\nilluminates the propriety of this finding considerably.\nIn Illinois v. Lafayette, the Supreme Court upheld the Fourth Amendment reasonableness of a police search\nincident to arrest of an arrestee's shoulder bag after the arrestee was handcuffed and taken to the police station\nfor disturbing the peace. See Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 641, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983).\nUnlike here, the Court likened the search to an \"inventory\" search, outlining the justifications under the\ncircumstances of orderly police administration, protection of the subject's property, deterrence of false claims of\n[12]\ntheft against police, security, and identification of the suspect. See id. at 643-47, 103 S.Ct. 2605. In doing so,\nhowever, the Court provided important insight into the unconstitutional nature of a search like the one in\n\ncontroversy here. Explaining the difference between a stationhouse inventory-type search and a more intrusive\nsearch such as that conducted on Ms. Amaechi, the Court reasoned that police conduct that would be\nimpractical, unreasonable, or embarrassingly invasive on the street can more readily be performed at the station:\nFor example, the interests supporting a search incident to arrest would hardly justify disrobing an\narrestee on the street, but the practical necessities of routine jail administration may even justify\ntaking a prisoner's clothes before confining him....\nId. at 645, 103 S.Ct. 2605 (emphasis added).\nAdmittedly, Ms. Amaechi was not \"disrobed\" per se by Officer West. But it might as well have been so, given her\nstate of dress (or undress) and the officer's probing of her skin and genital area.\nThe Fourth Circuit, in United States v. Dorlouis, addressed a defendant's challenge to a strip search of sorts\nconducted upon the police stop and arrest of four suspects driving a motor vehicle who were suspected of drug\ntrafficking. See United States v. Dorlouis, 107 F.3d 248, 251 (4th Cir.1997). Knowing that one or more of the\noccupants were carrying cash from a transaction made earlier in the day, the officers placed an arrestee in the\n[13]\njump seat of a police van, pulled his trousers down, and the money fell out. See id. at 256. In upholding the\nreasonableness of the strip search, the court explained that \"the search in question was not ... unconstitutional\"\nbecause it \"did not occur on the street subject to public viewing but took place in the privacy of the police van.\" Id.\n(emphasis added). Not so much can be said of the search of Ms. Amaechi. Instead, with no documented inkling\nof a threat to the officers' safety or her potential to destroy evidence, she was essentially paraded out to a public\n565 street with a *565 half-buttoned night dress on 00 exposing a significant portion of her nude body 00 and intrusively\n97 97\nsearched up and down in plain view of her husband, children, and neighbors. This, in the Court's view, was\nclearly unreasonable and violative of her Fourth Amendment rights.\nOther circuits have also looked unfavorably on \"strip\" or \"body cavity\" searches conducted incident to arrest,\nmost holding that they must be justified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing\ncontraband or weapons 00 a suspicion alarmingly missing in the facts at bar. See Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,\n97\n723 F.2d 1263, 1271 n. 7 (7th Cir.1983) (asserting that (1) strip or body cavity searches incident to arrest are only\nconstitutional where there is a reasonable belief that arrestee is concealing contraband and (2) that routine post-\narrest strip search of misdemeanants is unconstitutional); see also Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1446,\n1449 n. 11 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that a strip search with visual body cavity inspection is not justifiable as a\nsearch incident to arrest under Robinson; instead, such searches are governed by a higher standard); cf. Swain\nv. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1997) (opining that strip and visual body cavity searches must be justified by at\nleast a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons).\nMoreover, both strip and body cavity searches entailing the inspection of the anal and/or genital areas have been\naccurately described as demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, embarrassing, repulsive, degrading,\nand extremely intrusive of one's personal privacy. See, e.g., Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272; Wood v. Clemons,\n89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1996). This Court finds these labels particularly precise when, as with Ms. Amaechi, the\narrestee is merely a misdemeanant who has displayed no hostility towards the officers, presented no\ndocumented threat of violence or evidence-tampering, and could easily have been searched under much more\nreasonable conditions. Further support for this finding is evidenced in the invalidation of blanket strip search\npolicies against nonviolent misdemeanants by the Fourth Circuit, see generally Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007\n(4th Cir.1981), along with seven other United States Courts of Appeals. See Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F.Supp. 772,\n788 (E.D.Pa.1993) (outlining the eight applicable circuit-level cases). In each of the eight circuits, the arresting\nofficers under such circumstances must have reasonable individualized suspicion that a misdemeanor detainee\nis carrying or concealing contraband. See, e.g., Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273. In addition, individualized\nsuspicion sufficient to warrant a strip search of the arrestee in these eight circuits is based on factors such as the\nnature of the offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and any prior arrest record. See Fuller, 950 F.2d at\n1446. As stated above, the present circumstances involve the arrest of a cordial noise violation misdemeanant\npresenting no threat to the arresting officer 00 and with no prior arrest record.\n97\nConsequently, the Court opines that Ms. Amaechi's right to be free from a strip or body cavity search on the street\noutside of her house incident to an arrest for a noise violation misdemeanor is clearly and authoritatively\n\n[14]\nestablished in both the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit. See generally Wallace v. King, 626 F.2d 1157,\n566 1161 (4th Cir.1980). For the reasons *566 stated above, the \"contours of the right\" have been so conclusively\ndrawn as to leave no doubt that Officer West's alleged actions were unconstitutional.\n2. The Qualified Immunity Question\nHaving met the other elements necessary to deny the defense of qualified immunity to an eligible official, the\nCourt's last inquiry is whether a reasonable policeman in Officer West's position would have known that his\nalleged conduct violated the right identified above. See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034; see also\nsupra Part III.B. The Court holds that a reasonable officer in August 1997 would indeed comprehend that a\nvaginal cavity search under the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Ms. Amaechi 00 no matter how rapidly\n97\nperformed 00 would violate her clearly established rights. It follows that Officer West is not entitled to a defense of\n97\nqualified immunity.\nUndoubtedly, the qualified immunity defense is a useful tool to shield government officials performing their duties\nfrom the burdens of trial and monetary liability. See Harlow, 457 U.S. at 817-18, 102 S.Ct. 2727. Without such a\ndefense, government officials may not perform their discretionary duties as vigorously as required, instead acting\ntimidly to avoid the risk of being haled into federal court. See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034. Society\nwould bear the brunt of a system without such protection, including the diversion of official energy from pressing\npublic issues, and the deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public positions. See Harlow, 457 U.S. at\n814, 102 S.Ct. 2727. The Court has no such concerns here.\nTo the contrary, given the precedent documented above, along with the Fourth Amendment training a police\n[15]\nofficer receives prior to commencing the profession of law enforcement,  the Court suffers no hesitation in\nfinding that a reasonable officer in Officer West's position would not have conducted a vaginal search on Ms.\nAmaechi.\nAs stated earlier, based on the record, Ms. Amaechi presented no documented physical threat whatsoever to the\narresting officers. Similarly, the offense for which she was to be arrested involved no potential for the\nconcealment of evidence. Thus, instead of handcuffing Ms. Amaechi on the spot and rushing her out to the police\nvehicle, a reasonable officer may first have granted Ms. Amaechi's request to change, while supervised, into\ndress more suitable for her transport to the police station. More importantly, that same reasonable officer would\nhave known not to conduct a vaginal body cavity search incident to a misdemeanor noise violation arrest on a\nsemi-clad arrestee 00 in front of that arrestee's children and in the middle of a public neighborhood street.\n97\nAccordingly, Officer West was conclusively unreasonable in not recognizing the clearly established right of Ms.\nAmaechi to be secure from the disputed search.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThis Memorandum Opinion supplements the Court's Order of January 13, 2000 granting in part, and denying in\npart, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. See Order, Amaechi v. West, No. CIV.A. 99-783-A (E.D.Va.\nJan. 13, 2000) (Lee, J.) (reserving the right to supplement Order with Memorandum Opinion if appeal taken by\neither party). As stated in that Order and for the reasons stated herein, Defendants' Motion for Summary\nJudgment with regard to the counts against Officer West is hereby DENIED.\nThe Clerk is directed to forward a copy of this Order to counsel of record.\n[1] The original Complaint contained seven counts. Two of the counts, II and VII, were withdrawn by Plaintiff. The\nfollowing were the five remaining counts at the time of Defendants' motion: \nAgainst Defendant Town of Dumfries:\n(1) Count I 00 Failure to Train;\n97\n\nAgainst Defendant Officer Bernard R. Pfluger:\n(2) Count III 00 Wrongful Arrest;\n97\n(3) Count IV 00 Failure to Instruct and Supervise;\n97\nAgainst Defendant Officer Matthew West:\n(4) Count V 00 Unconstitutional Search;\n97\n(5) Count VI 00 Assault and Battery (Virginia state law).\n97\n[2] Collectively, the three Defendants will be referred to throughout the Opinion as \"Defendants.\"\n[3] Procedurally speaking, the issue for the Court is whether, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Ms.\nAmaechi, there exists a genuine issue as to any material fact with regard to the two counts against Officer West. \nSee FED.R.CIV.P. 56(c). As the Court will explain below, see infra Part III.A, the record suggests that genuine\nissues for trial do indeed exist, necessitating the denial of summary judgment for that reason alone 00\n97\nnotwithstanding the more substantive reasons for denying summary judgment outlined in the remainder of this\nOpinion. See infra Part III.B. 1-2.\n[4] As a side note, the charges against Ms. Amaechi were dismissed after she agreed to mediate the noise\ndispute with her neighbor.\n[5] Officer West stated in his deposition that he had made no more than five total arrests prior to the Amaechi\narrest. See West Dep. at 40. Moreover, he had completed his preliminary training only six weeks earlier. He\nbegan his one-year probationary period of employment with the police force on July 2, 1997.\n[6] Officer West denies touching Plaintiff's genitals. See West Dep. at 81 (\"I didn't do any groin area search. I did\nwhat looks to be a pat down for weapons.\"); see also id. at 68 (series of denials by Officer West to questions of\nwhether he touched Plaintiff's knees, inner thighs, buttocks, crotch area, or vaginal area). Both parties, however,\nagree that the entire search took only a few seconds. See Amaechi Dep. at 92.\n[7] In Behrens v. Pelletier, the Supreme Court examined this same issue, ultimately crystallizing its Johnson\nholding: \nJohnson held, simply, that determinations of evidentiary sufficiency at summary judgment are not immediately\nappealable merely because they happen to arise in a qualified-immunity case; if what is at issue in the sufficiency\ndetermination is nothing more than whether the evidence could support a finding that particular conduct occurred,\nthe question decided is not truly \"separable\" from the plaintiff's claim, and hence there is no final decision.... \nJohnson reaffirmed that summary judgment determinations are appealable when they resolve a dispute\nconcerning an \"abstract issu[e] of law\" relating to qualified immunity 00 typically, the issue whether the federal\n97\nright allegedly infringed was \"clearly established.\" See Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S.Ct. 834,\n133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996) (alteration in original) (citations omitted).\n[8] Moreover, as discussed earlier, the Court's finding here is not appealable.\n[9] Predictably, an official will ordinarily retain a qualified immunity defense if the right is recognized in some other\ncircuit, but not in the Fourth Circuit. The nonexistence of a case holding the defendant's identical conduct to be\nunlawful, however, does not prevent the denial of qualified immunity. See infra note 14.\n[10] Explaining itself further, the high Court opined that: \nThe interests in human dignity and privacy which the Fourth Amendment protects forbid any intrusions on the\nmere chance that desired evidence may be obtained. In the absence of a clear indication that in fact such\nevidence will be found, these fundamental human interests require law officers to suffer the risk that such\nevidence may disappear unless there is an immediate search.\nSchmerber, 384 U.S. at 769-70, 86 S.Ct. 1826.\n\n[11] In other words, \n[s]earch warrants are ordinarily required for searches of dwellings, and absent an emergency, no less could be\nrequired where intrusions into the human body are concerned. The requirement that a warrant be obtained is a\nrequirement that inferences to support the search \"be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of\nbeing judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\"\nSchmerber, 384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. 1826 (emphasis added) (quoting Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10,\n13-14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948)).\n[12] \"The governmental interests underlying a stationhouse search of the arrestee's person and possessions may\nin some circumstances be even greater than those supporting a search immediately following arrest.\nConsequently, the scope of a stationhouse search will often vary from that made at the time of the arrest.\" \nLafayette, 462 U.S. at 645, 103 S.Ct. 2605.\n[13] The boxer shorts of the arrestee were not removed, however. See Dorlouis, 107 F.3d at 256.\n[14] Stated another way, the existing authority is such that the unlawfulness of Officer West's alleged search is\nmanifest and apparent. See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034; see also Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818-19,\n102 S.Ct. at 2738; Pritchett v. Alford, 973 F.2d 307, 314 (4th Cir.1992) (explaining that \"[t]he fact that an exact\nright allegedly violated has not earlier been specifically recognized by any court does not prevent a determination\nthat it was nevertheless `clearly established' for qualified immunity purposes\" and that \"`[c]learly established' in\nthis context includes not only already specifically adjudicated rights, but those manifestly included within more\ngeneral applications of the core constitutional principle invoked\").\n[15] Officer West was trained at the Rappahannock Criminal Justice Academy, which is certified by the\nCommonwealth of Virginia to train law enforcement personnel.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Amaechi sought damages arising out of what Amaechi claims was a sexually intrusive search\nexecuted upon her by West incident to her arrest for violation of a town noise ordinance. The district court denied\nWest's motion for summary judgment based upon a defense of qualified immunity, reasoning that West's search,\nas described by Amaechi, violated Amaechi's clearly established constitutional rights under the Fourth\nAmendment. West ultimately disputes Amaechi's description of West's search, presenting what the district court\nreferred to as a \"factual conundrum.\" (J.A. at 306). Because this is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of\nqualified immunity on summary judgment, however, we must accept Amaechi's version of the facts surrounding\n[2]\nthe search as true for purposes of this appeal. See Pritchett v. Alford, 973 F.2d 307, 313 (4th Cir.1992). Based\n359 upon Amaechi's characterization of the search, we affirm the district *359 court's denial of qualified immunity, and\nwe remand for further proceedings.\nI.\nAmaechi and her husband, a guard at the Lorton correctional facility, lived in a townhouse in Dumfries, Virginia.\nAmaechi's young children sometimes played music in the townhouse too loudly, causing neighbors to complain.\n[3]\n On August 10, 1997, Officer Stephen Hargrave, of the Dumfries Police Department, responded to a complaint\nfrom one of the Amaechis' neighbors about the loud music coming from the Amaechis' townhouse. Hargrave\ninstructed Amaechi to turn down the music, and she did so. At that time, Hargrave told Amaechi that he would not\narrest her unless he received another complaint about the noise level. Believing that Hargrave was unnecessarily\nimpolite in his handling of the matter, Amaechi called the Prince William County Police Department and\n[4]\ncomplained about Hargrave's conduct.  Hargrave discovered that Amaechi had registered a complaint against\n\nhim later that afternoon. On August 12, 1997, without any further complaints about the noise level, Hargrave\nsecured an arrest warrant charging Amaechi for the two-day old violation of the Town of Dumfries's misdemeanor\n[5]\nnoise ordinance.\nAfter 9:00 pm that night, Officer Pfluger took his trainee, West, and other officers to the Amaechis' townhouse to\n[6]\nexecute the arrest warrant.  When Pfluger and West knocked on the door, a nude Amaechi was in her\n[7]\nbathroom preparing for bed. She covered herself with a house dress and followed her husband downstairs.\nWhen Amaechi answered the door with her husband, Pfluger told her she was under arrest. Amaechi fully\ncooperated during the arrest, but when told that she was to be handcuffed, Amaechi pointed out to the officers\nthat she was completely naked under the dress and requested permission to get dressed because she would no\nlonger be able to hold her dress closed once handcuffed. This request was denied, and Amaechi's hands were\nsecured behind her back, causing her dress to fall open below her chest.\nPfluger then turned to West, who was at the door with Pfluger, and told him to complete Amaechi's processing.\nWest escorted Amaechi to the police car in her semi-clad state, walking past several officers on the way to the\ncar. Amaechi proceeded to enter the back door of the car, which West had opened. West stopped her and told\nher that he would have to search her before she entered the car. Amaechi protested that she was not wearing\nany underwear, and West said, \"I still have to search you.\" (J.A. at 33). West then stood in front of Amaechi,\nsqueezed her hips, and inside her opened dress, \"swiped\" one ungloved hand, palm up, across her bare vagina,\nat which time the tip of his finger slightly penetrated Amaechi's genitals. Amaechi jumped back, still in handcuffs,\nand exclaimed, \"I told you I don't have on any underwear.\" (J.A. at 40). West did not respond and proceeded to\n360 put his hand \"up into [her] butt cheeks,\" kneading them. (J.A. at 41). West then allowed Amaechi to enter the \n*360 car. This search took place directly in front of the Amaechis' townhouse, where the other police officers,\nAmaechi's husband, her five children, and all of her neighbors had the opportunity to observe.\nOn June 2, 1999, Amaechi filed a seven count complaint in federal district court, claiming money damages\nagainst West in his individual capacity, the Town of Dumfries, and Pfluger under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 (West\nSupp.2000) and under state law for West's alleged sexually invasive search. Upon the close of discovery, all\ndefendants moved for summary judgment. Amaechi voluntarily withdrew the count alleging the unconstitutionality\nof the Town of Dumfries' policy permitting her arrest for violation of the noise ordinance and the count alleging\nWest's intentional infliction of emotional distress. The district court granted summary judgment on the three\n[8]\ncounts pertaining to Pfluger and the Town of Dumfries.  The district court, however, denied West's motion for\n[9]\nsummary judgment as to the two counts against him and denied West's defense of qualified immunity.  West\nfiled an interlocutory appeal with this Court.\nII.\nThe only issue we consider is whether the district court correctly denied West's summary judgment motion upon\ndetermining that West was not entitled to qualified immunity. We review the district court's ruling de novo. Hodge\nv. Jones, 31 F.3d 157, 163 (4th Cir.1994). \"Qualified immunity is an accommodation by the courts to the\nconflicting concerns of, on one hand, government officials seeking freedom from personal monetary liability and\nharassing litigation and, on the other hand, injured persons seeking redress for the abuse of official power.\" Id. at\n162 (internal quotation marks omitted). To that end, qualified immunity protects government officials performing\ndiscretionary functions from liability for civil damages \"insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). In determining whether a government official is entitled to\nqualified immunity, the steps are sequential; we \"`must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the\ndeprivation of an actual constitutional right at all,'\" before \"`proceed[ing] to determine whether that right was\nclearly established at the time of the alleged violation.'\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143\nL.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 119 S.Ct. 1292, 143 L.Ed.2d 399 (1999)).\nAccordingly, we address Amaechi's claim by focusing first on whether Amaechi's complaint has alleged a\n\ndeprivation of her constitutional right to be free from an unreasonable search, and we then turn to whether that\nright was clearly established at the time of her arrest.\nA.\nIn relevant part, the Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons ... against\nunreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. Therefore, to be constitutional, a search must not\nbe unreasonable. Vernonia Sch. Dist. v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 653, 115 S.Ct. 2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 (1995).\nAmaechi contends that West's search, including the touching and penetration of her genitalia, was unreasonable\n361 in light of the circumstances surrounding the arrest. West argues, on the other *361 hand, that Supreme Court\nprecedent allows an officer, conducting a search incident to arrest, to effectuate a \"full search of the person.\"\n(Appellant's Br. at 16) (emphasis in original) (citing United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 236, 94 S.Ct. 467,\n38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973)). West argues that this right to conduct a full search of the person under Robinson\nincludes the right to briefly \"swipe\" the arrestee's outer genitalia and slightly penetrate the genitalia. (Appellant's\nBr. at 17-18).\n[10]\nWe believe that West interprets Robinson too broadly. Robinson did not, nor could it, rewrite the Fourth\nAmendment to exclude the explicit requirement that no search be unreasonable. Nor did Robinson hold that all\nsearches incident to arrest, no matter how invasive, are inherently reasonable. To the contrary, since Robinson,\nthe Supreme Court has continued to emphasize that Fourth Amendment jurisprudence prohibits unreasonable\nsearches incident to arrest. See, e.g., Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 645, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65\n(1983) (\"[T]he interests supporting a search incident to arrest would hardly justify disrobing an arrestee on the\nstreet....\"). Therefore, to determine whether West's search of Amaechi is constitutional, it is not enough to\nconclude that it was a search incident to a valid arrest. Rather, we must determine whether the search was\nunreasonable.\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court established an\n[11]\nanalytical framework for determining the reasonableness of a sexually intrusive search. Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct.\n1861. In Bell, the Supreme Court held that a reasonableness inquiry requires a court to balance the need for the\nparticular search against the invasion of the personal rights that the search entailed. See id. This balancing\nrequires a court to conduct a contextual analysis to determine reasonableness by analyzing \"the scope of the\nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.\" Id.\nWest's search was highly intrusive without any apparent justification. Amaechi was arrested for a two-day old\nmisdemeanor noise violation, she submitted to arrest peacefully, she advised the officers that she had on no\nunderclothes, and she requested the officers to allow her to get dressed before being placed in handcuffs.\nInstead, the officers secured Amaechi's hands behind her back and made her walk to the car and stand in the\nstreet with her dress open and lower body exposed. West proceeded to search by touching and penetrating\nAmaechi's genitalia and kneading her buttocks with his ungloved hand. This invasive search was not conducted\nin a private holding cell but rather was conducted on the street in front of Amaechi's home, subject to viewing by\n362 Amaechi's family, the public, and the other officers. Cf. Polk v. Montgomery Co., Md., 782 F.2d *362 1196,\n1201-02 (4th Cir.1986) (\"[Whether the strip search was conducted in private] is especially relevant in determining\nwhether a strip search is reasonable under the circumstances.\"). West does not allege that he conducted the\nsearch in such a manner because of a perceived threat to his or the other officers' safety. See generally Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (requiring a court to weigh the intrusiveness of the search against the justification for\nconducting the search). In fact, West could not rely upon any type of security justification for this search, in that\n[12]\nthe dress was thin and was almost completely open, making any weapons immediately apparent.  Nor did the\npossibility exist that Amaechi would attempt to destroy or conceal evidence related to the noise violation.\nBecause the invasiveness of Amaechi's search far outweighed any potential justification for the scope, manner,\nand place under which it was conducted, see id., we agree with the district court that the search was\nunreasonable and, therefore, unconstitutional.\n\nB.\nWe turn next to the question of whether Amaechi's right to be free from this sexually invasive search was clearly\nestablished at the time West performed the search. For purposes of analyzing whether this Fourth Amendment\nviolation was clearly established, we must go beyond the general \"unreasonableness\" of the search and\ndetermine \"at a high level of particularity\" the nature of the Fourth Amendment violation. Edwards v. City of\nGoldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 250-51 (4th Cir. 1999); see also Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615, 119 S.Ct. 1692,\n143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (stating that \"the right allegedly violated must be defined at the acceptable level of\nspecificity\"). In light of this requirement of a \"high level of particularity,\" we must analyze whether clearly\nestablished Fourth Amendment jurisprudence protected Amaechi's right to be free from the public exposure,\ntouching, and penetration of her genitalia and kneading of her buttocks during a search incident to arrest for a\nmisdemeanor noise violation, and where no security risk or threat of the concealment or destruction of evidence\nwas present.\nWest conceded at oral argument that a strip search or a body cavity search conducted in public violates an\narrestee's Fourth Amendment right to a reasonable search, but he argues that relevant precedent does not define\nhis conduct as unlawful because no case holds that the \"swiping\" and \"slight\" penetration of an arrestee's\ngenitalia pursuant to a search incident to an arrest violates the Fourth Amendment. Contrary to West's argument,\nthe exact conduct at issue need not have been held unlawful for the law governing an officer's actions to be\nclearly established. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (\"This\nis not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has\npreviously been held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be\napparent.\" (internal citation omitted)). Such precise precedent is not what the particularity principle mandates.\nRather, the particularity principle mandates that courts refer to concrete applications of abstract concepts to\ndetermine whether the right is clearly established. See Doe v. Broderick, 225 F.3d 440, 458-59 (4th Cir.2000)\n(Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Lassiter v. Alabama A & M Univ., 28 F.3d 1146,\n363 1150 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc)). Thus, \"`clearly established' in this context includes not *363 only already\nspecifically adjudicated rights, but those manifestly included within more general applications of the core\nconstitutional principle invoked.\" Pritchett v. Alford, 973 F.2d 307, 314 (4th Cir. 1992). The \"contours of the right\"\nmust be drawn in such a way as to provide notice to a reasonable person in the official's position that his conduct\nviolated the identified right. See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034 (\"The contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\"); Swanson\nv. Powers, 937 F.2d 965, 969 (4th Cir.1991) (\"Rather, the `contours of the right' must have been so conclusively\ndrawn as to leave no doubt that the challenged action was unconstitutional.\"). Accordingly, we must determine\nwhether the contours of the right to be free from an unreasonable search have been identified in such a way as to\nafford West adequate notice that his search of Amaechi transgressed the Fourth Amendment. In doing so, we\nlook to \"cases of controlling authority in[this] jurisdiction,\" as well as the \"consensus of cases of persuasive\nauthority\" from other jurisdictions. Wilson, 526 U.S. at 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692.\nFor purposes of analyzing whether West was on notice that his search of Amaechi was unlawful, we agree with\nthe district court that precedent outlining limitations on the right to conduct strip searches are relevant. A strip\nsearch under federal law includes the exposure of a person's naked body for the purpose of a visual or physical\nexamination. See United States v. Dorlouis, 107 F.3d 248, 256 (4th Cir.1997) (treating the act of pulling down a\nsuspect's trousers, while leaving his boxer shorts intact, as a strip search and equating \"an unconstitutional strip\nsearch\" with \"an unnecessarily intrusive search\"); United States v. Vance, 62 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.1995)\n(treating pulling down a suspect's trousers and underwear in public as a strip search); United States v. Cardenas,\n9 F.3d 1139, 1145 (5th Cir. 1993) (noting that directing a suspect to undress amounts to a strip search). A body\ncavity search under federal law includes a visual or physical examination into the body's recesses. See Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nAmaechi's claim involves characteristics of both a strip search and a body cavity search. Although Amaechi was\nnot per se \"disrobed\" by West, the officers in effect caused her substantial disrobing by refusing to allow her to\nchange clothes after she informed them that handcuffing her would cause her naked body to be completely\n\nexposed from the waist down. Regardless of whether refusing to allow Amaechi to change was unreasonable,\n[13]\n the officers certainly knew or should have known that handcuffing Amaechi would result in publicly exposing\na significant portion of her naked lower body. Yet, they nevertheless proceeded to secure Amaechi's hands\nbehind her back. Then, with Amaechi in this vulnerable position, West, without any suspicion of danger to the\nofficers or the possibility of the destruction of evidence, proceeded to go beyond \"visual examination\" and a pat\ndown of the outside of Amaechi's housedress and instead physically touched and penetrated her genitalia and\nkneaded her buttocks with his bare hand. Public exposure of the genitalia accompanied by physical touching is\nfar more intrusive than directing an arrestee to remove her clothing in private for the purpose of \"visually\ninspecting\" the arrestee's genitalia. See Bond v. United States, 529 U.S. 334, 337, 120 S.Ct. 1462, 1464, 146\nL.Ed.2d 365 (2000) (\"Physically invasive inspection is simply more intrusive than purely visual inspection.\").\n364 Physical penetration of the genitalia, no matter how *364 slight, is an intrusion into the arrestee's body cavity and\nis the ultimate invasion of personal dignity. Accordingly, we have no difficulty concluding, as did the district court,\n[14]\nthat West's search, as described by Amaechi, is analogous to a strip search.\nFirmly rooted Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit precedent involving strip searches and body cavity searches\nshould have made it apparent to West, as a reasonable officer, that his search of Amaechi was unlawful under\nthe Fourth Amendment. It is not a new rule of law that searches involving the public exposure, touching, and\npenetration of an arrestee's genitalia are subject to limitations under the Fourth Amendment. Relevant precedent\ncompels the conclusion that West's search transgressed these clear limitations.\nThe Supreme Court has expressly disavowed the right of an officer to disrobe an arrestee on the street pursuant\nto a search incident to an arrest without the presence of justifying factors. See Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. at\n645, 103 S.Ct. 2605 (\"[T]he interests supporting a search incident to arrest would hardly justify disrobing an\narrestee on the street.\"). The fact that, absent clear justification or exigent circumstances, an officer is not allowed\nto strip an arrestee on a public street pursuant to a search incident to an arrest necessarily means that an officer\ncannot go even further than simply disrobing the arrestee by actually touching and penetrating the arrestee's\nexposed genitalia on the public street.\nThis Court also has disavowed the type of public search conducted by West. We have applied the Bell analytical\nframework to set forth clear guidelines as to the manner in which a strip search must be conducted in order to\ncomport with an arrestee's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559,\n99 S.Ct. 1861. For instance, we have repeatedly emphasized the necessity of conducting a strip search in\nprivate. See Dorlouis, 107 F.3d at 256 (emphasizing that \"[t]he search did not occur on the street subject to public\nviewing but took place in the privacy of the police van.\"); Polk v. Montgomery Co., Md., 782 F.2d 1196, 1201-02\n(4th Cir.1986) (\"[Whether the strip search was conducted in private] is especially relevant in determining whether\na strip search is reasonable under the circumstances.\"); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1014 (4th Cir.1981)\n(\"One of the critical, and certainly most obvious, elements in the Bell v. Wolfish balancing inquiry into the\nreasonableness of a strip search is `the place in which it is conducted.'\"). Despite these cases requiring the strip\nsearch to be conducted in private, West conducted his search of Amaechi on the street in front of the police\ncruiser, making it possible for the other police officers, Amaechi's neighbors, and her family to observe.\nMoreover, this Court has recognized the fact, first established in Bell, that the intrusive, highly degrading nature of\na strip search demands a reason for conducting such a search that counterbalances the invasion of personal\nrights that such a search involves. Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013. In Logan, we held the fact that the arrestee was\n365 charged only with an offense that was not commonly associated with the possession *365 of weapons or\ncontraband, without any indication that the arrestee possessed weapons or other contraband, weighed against\nthe constitutionality of the strip search because \"Logan's strip search bore no ... discernible relationship to\nsecurity needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the ultimate invasion of personal rights\ninvolved, it could reasonably be thought justified.\" Id. Similarly, because West had no reason to believe that\nAmaechi posed a danger to the officers, and because Amaechi was arrested for a misdemeanor noise violation,\nWest should have known that his search of Amaechi similarly was unjustified and therefore unconstitutional.\nOur agreement with the district court that West's search is clearly analogous to precedent involving strip searches\n[15]\nis further supported by Virginia's definition of strip search.  Virginia's statutory law, which is similar to that of\nmost states, provides that, \"[s]trip search shall mean having an arrested person remove or arrange some or all of\n\nhis clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the genitals, buttocks, anus, female breasts, or undergarments\nof such person.\" Va.Code Ann. § 19.2-59.1(F) (Michie 1999) (emphasis added). Contrary to West's argument that\nhis search of Amaechi does not meet the requisites of strip search as that phrase is defined by state statute,\nWest's search actually was self-evidently more invasive than the type of search contemplated by the statute\nbecause he went beyond visual inspection into physical inspection.\nThose statutory restrictions provided West with ample notice that his search of Amaechi was unreasonable. The\nstatute requires an officer to conduct a strip search only in a private place. See Va. Code Ann. § 19.2-59.1(A).\nThe provision further requires that strip searches, where permissible, be conducted \"by persons of the same sex\nas the person arrested and on the premises where the search cannot be observed by persons not physically\nconducting the search.\" Id. Therefore, West's search of Amaechi violated every aspect of Virginia's own law\ngoverning the propriety of strip searches. Because the state statute is in accordance with federal law governing\nlimitations on the manner and scope of strip searches, West had no reason to believe his search of Amaechi was\n[16]\nreasonable or fell within a questionable area of law.\nIII.\nThe entire body of jurisprudence applying limits on the type of sexually intrusive search conducted by West\nprovides West with notice that his search of Amaechi was unconstitutionally unreasonable. There was absolutely\nno justification for this type of public search, in the form of a safety, security, or evidentiary concern; it was made\nincident to a two-day old arrest for a minor noise violation; and West's kneading of Amaechi's buttocks and his\n366 touching *366 and penetration of Amaechi's exposed genitalia with his ungloved hand affronts the basic\nprotections of the Fourth Amendment, which at its core is designed to protect privacy and personal dignity against\nunjustified invasion by the State, see Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 767, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908\n(1966). Accordingly, on the facts shown by Amaechi, we conclude that Amaechi has alleged a deprivation of her\nconstitutionally protected right to be free from an unreasonable search and that West is not entitled to qualified\nimmunity. We, therefore, affirm the district court's denial of West's summary judgment motion based upon his\nasserted qualified immunity defense and remand for further proceedings.\nAFFIRMED AND REMANDED.\n[1] Amaechi also joined the Town of Dumfries, Virginia and Sergeant Bernard Pfluger of the Dumfries Police\nDepartment in her § 1983 suit, but the district court dismissed both parties on January 13, 2000.\n[2] Indeed, if West challenged Amaechi's version of the facts for purposes of his appeal, we would be without\njurisdiction to resolve his qualified immunity defense at this interlocutory stage. See Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S.\n304, 311, 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995). In such a case, where genuine issues of material fact\nexist, the officer is entitled to appeal the district court's denial of his qualified immunity defense at the conclusion\nof trial, once the factual issues have been resolved. See id.\n[3] In August 1997, Amaechi's five children ranged in age from four to eleven years.\n[4] Amaechi did not call the Dumfries Police Department because she believed it would \"likely inappropriately\nprotect its own.\" (Appellee's Br. at 5).\n[5] Amaechi was never convicted of this offense. She resolved the dispute with her neighbor through mediation.\n[6] This was West's first arrest of a woman. He resigned from the police force approximately six months later.\n[7] The housedress was made of a light weight fabric, had spaghetti straps, and had buttonholes all the way\ndown the front. It was missing all of its buttons from immediately below the chest, however, requiring Amaechi to\ngather the dress with her hand to keep it closed.\n[8] The district court held that Pfluger was not responsible for training West and that the town had properly\ndischarged its duty to train West by sending him to a state-approved law enforcement academy. The district court\n\nalso dismissed the count against Pfluger charging wrongful arrest. Amaechi has not cross-appealed these\nrulings.\n[9] The remaining charges against West allege an unconstitutional search and assault and battery.\n[10] To demonstrate the breadth of the interpretation West gives to Robinson, counsel for West argued at the\nmotions hearing before the district court that Robinson might permit an officer to examine a person's private\nareas and perform a cavity search in public, in a \"measured way,\" regardless of the amount of time such a search\nrequired. (J.A. at 253-54).\n[11] West argues that Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), does not apply\nbecause West's search did not qualify as a \"strip search.\" In support of his argument, West primarily relies upon\nthe fact that West's search was very quick and, therefore, was not conducted with the requisite intent to constitute\na strip search. Without deciding whether a strip search requires an element of intent, we note that whether West\nintended to strip search Amaechi is a question of fact for the trial court and is not properly resolved on summary\njudgment. Additionally, we note that Bell was not limited simply to strip searches but rather developed a flexible\ntest to determine reasonableness that includes the concerns implicated by West's search of Amaechi. See id. at\n558-59, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (holding that courts must review the scope of the \"invasion of personal rights that the\nsearch entails\" to determine whether the search was reasonable).\n[12] To the extent that Amaechi's hands were secured behind her back, with her shoulders bare and dress open\nfrom the waist down, weapons easily could have been viewed without necessitating any pat down. The outline of\npossible weapons could have been seen through the thin material of the dress, and parts of Amaechi's body that\nwere not already exposed could have been searched by a pat down.\n[13] In United States v. Gwinn, 219 F.3d 326 (4th Cir.2000), we held that an officer is justified in retrieving suitable\nattire for the arrestee for his transport to the police station. See id. at 329; see also United States v. Di Stefano,\n555 F.2d 1094, 1101 (2d Cir.1977) (holding that officers have a duty to find clothing for an arrestee or permit an\narrestee to do so).\n[14] Additionally, we need not decide whether West's search was a strip search to apply precedent involving strip\nsearches because those cases are not limited to strip searches per se. Rather, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99\nS.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), and subsequent cases involving strip searches express a more general\nconcern with the Fourth Amendment implications underlying the violation of personal privacy inherent in sexually\ninvasive searches. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)\n(refusing to require exact precedent as opposed to merely analogous precedent from which the unlawfulness of\nthe officer's actions is made apparent). Because West's search involved the unwarranted public touching and\npenetration of Amaechi's genitalia, we believe that his search is guided by the principles found in Bell and\nsubsequent cases governing sexually invasive searches.\n[15] It is important to note that the technical language of the Virginia statute is not the controlling factor in\ndetermining whether this was in fact a strip search. Rather, that determination is informed by federal law. See \nDavis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 194-95, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984) (holding that the only relevant\ninquiry is whether federal law rights are clearly established; it does not matter that the officer simultaneously\nviolates state law rights that are clearly established). Nevertheless, because states define strip search in a\nuniform fashion, see, e.g., Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 16-3-405 (West 1998); Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. § 54-33k (West\n1994); Fla. Stat. Ann. § 901.211 (West 1996); Iowa Code Ann. § 702.23 (West 1993), we find state law\npersuasive on our interpretation of what constitutes a strip search.\n[16] In support of our determination that a reasonable officer should have been on notice that his search violated\nthe Fourth Amendment, we note that the Sixth Circuit has held that a reasonable officer should be on notice that\nsimply requiring an individual to sit naked while the officers search the arrestee's home is a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment, thereby depriving the officers of qualified immunity. See Hall v. Shipley, 932 F.2d 1147, 1153-54 (6th\nCir.1991). West's search went far beyond simply requiring Amaechi to stand naked while West conducted the\nsearch.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
