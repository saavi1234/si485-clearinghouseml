Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, alleged that this policy and practice violated the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. They requested monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and certification of a class consisting of individuals who were strip searched at the Correctional Department after being detained non-indictable offenses</p>\r\n<p>On August 7, 2007, the County of Salem filed a motion to dismiss. On September 28, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, rendering the motion to dismiss moot. The parties attended a mediation conference before Judge Joel B. Rosen on January 24, 2008. The parties continued their mediation, and eventually reached a settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>On December 30, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class for purposes of sending out notice to those class members who would be entitled to recover under the settlement agreement. The class was defined as&nbsp;\"[a]ll persons who were placed into the custody of the Salem County Correctional Facility after being charged with non-indictable offenses, disorderly persons offenses, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other non-indictable occurrences, and who were Strip Searched upon their entry into Salem County Correctional Facility in the absence of reasonable suspicion that the individual harbored contraband.\" Plaintiffs also filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. On February 27, 2009, the court granted these motions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 7, 2009, the court approved the settlement agreement, closing the case. Under the settlement agreement, the defendants agreed to pay $640,000 into a Settlement Fund for the benefit of Class Members and the named plaintiff in this litigation. Of that $640,000, the Class Counsel was entitled to $192,000 in attorneys' fees and $6,070.36 in expenses.</p>\r\n<p>The case is closed now.</p>",

The plaintiff, Dana Clark (โP laintiffโ), brings this class  action individually \nand on behalf of, as more particularly defi ned in Paragraph 14 below, a class of a ll \npersons  who were   strip-searched  at the Salem County Co rrectional  Department  (the \nโCorrectional Departmentโ) after being held on child suppor t warrants or charged with \nnon-indictable  crimes  and traffic violations ,  in  contravention  of  their  rights  against \nunreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n2.  Plaintiff seeks monetary damages individually and for each  member of the \nproposed class who has suffered from  the wrongful actions of the defendants described \nherein; a declaration that the defendantsโ policies are unconstitutional; and, an injunction \n  1\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 2 of 14 PageID: 129\nprecluding the defendants from continuing to violate the rights  of those placed in their \ncustody or detention. \nPARTIES \n3.   Plaintiff Dana Clark (โCl arkโ or โPlaintiffโ) is, and at a ll times relevant \nhereto has been, a resident  of the State of New Jersey.  On or about October 26, 2006, \nClark was arrested by Carneyโs Point Police Department for open municipal warrants and \nsubsequently transported to the Salem County Jail with a bail of approximately $500.00.  \nClark was illegally strip searched at the Jail on the day of her adm ission.  Clark paid her \nbail and was released on or about October 28, 2006.   \n4.  Defendant County of Salem (the โCountyโ) is a county government organized \nand existing under the laws of New Jersey.  At all times relevant hereto, the County, \nacting through its Sheriffโs Department and the Correctional Department, was responsible \nfor  the policies, practices, supervision,  implementation  and conduct of all m atters \npertaining to the Salem County Jail and was  responsible for the a ppointment, training, \nsupervision and conduct of all Sheriffโs De partment and Salem County Correctional \nDepartmentโs personnel, including those working at the Salem County Jail. In addition, at \nall relevant times, the County was responsib le for enforcing the rules of the Salem \nCounty Correctional Department and for ensuring that Sheriffโs Department and Salem \nCounty Correctional Departmentโs employees obey the Constitution and the laws of the \nUnited States and New Jersey.  \n5.  The Salem County Sheriffโs Departm ent (the โSheriffโs Departmentโ) is a \nCounty of Salem political subdivision, organized and existing under the laws of New \nJersey. At all times relevant hereto, the Sheriffโs Department, together with the County of \n  2\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 3 of 14 PageID: 130\nSalem,  was responsible for the policies,  practices,  supervision, im plementation  and \nconduct of all matters pertaining to the Sheriffโs Department, and was responsible for the \nappointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriffโs Department personnel and \nthat they obey the Constitution and the laws of the United States and of the State of New \nJersey.  \n   7.   Defendant Raym ond Skradzinski (โWarden Skradzinskiโ) is the W arden of \nthe Correctional Department and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment \nof  pretrial and other deta inees  over  which the Correctional Departm ent  exercises \ncustodial or other control. Warden Skradzinski is made a defendant in this action in both \nhis individual and official capacities.  \n8.   Defendant Charles Miller (โSheriff  Millerโ) is the Sheriff of Salem County  \nand,  as such, is a policy m aker  with respec t  to the treatm ent  of pretrial and other \ndetainees  over  which the Sheriffโs Departm ent  exercises custodial or other control. \nSheriff Miller is m ade a defendant in this action in both his individual and official \ncapacities. \n    9.  Collectively, Salem County and Sheriffโs Department, will be referred to as the \nโMunicipal Defendantsโ and Warden Skradzinski and Sheriff Miller will be referred to as \nthe โPolicy Making Defendantsโ.  \n10.  Collectively, the Municipal Defenda nts and Policy Making Defendants will \nbe referred to as the โDefendants.โ  \n \n \n \n  3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 4 of 14 PageID: 131\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \nยงยง1331, 1341 and 1343, because it was filed to obtained compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of \ncitizens of the United States secured by the United States Constitution and by federal law \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง1981 and 1983. This C ourt also has jurisdiction over this action \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ยง2201, as it  was filed to obtain declaratory relie f \nrelative to the Constitutionality of the policies of a local government.  \n12.  Venue is proper un der 28 U.S.C. ยง1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise \nto the Plaintiffโs claim s and those of propos ed class members occurred in this judicial \ndistrict. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant  to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on be half of Plaintiff and a cl ass of similarly \nsituated individuals who were arrested for non- indictable offenses or other minor crimes \nand who were unlawfully detained and stri p-searched upon their entry into the Salem \nCounty Jail. \n14.  The Class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as: \n \nAll persons who have been be placed into custody of the Salem County Jail after \nbeing charged with non-indictable offenses (such as fourth degree offenses, traffic \ninfractions and/or civil comm itments) and were strip-searched upon their entry \ninto the Salem County Jail.  \n \nThe Class period commences on or about May 8, 2005, and extends to the date on which \nthe Defendants are enjo ined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing the ir unconstitutional \n  4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 5 of 14 PageID: 132\npolicy, practice and custom  of conducting strip-searches  absent reasonable suspicion. \nSpecifically excluded from the Class are Defendants and any and all  of their respective \naffiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.  \n15.  This action may be brought and properly maintained as a class action under \nFederal  law  and satisf ies  the n umerosity,  commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n16.  The members of the Class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nThere are, and have been, hundreds of people  who have been arrested for non-indictable \noffenses, traffic infractions, failing to m ake payment on outstanding traffic violations, \nfailing to make paym ent on outstanding fines  or other minor crimes, who were s trip-\nsearched under the circumstances described herein.   \n            17.  Joinder of all these individuals is impracticable because of the large number \nof Class members and the fact th at Class members are likely d ispersed over a large \ngeographical area with some members residing outside of Salem County and this Judicial \nDistrict.  Further, many members of the Cl ass are low-income persons, may not speak \nEnglish, may not know of their rights and lik ely would have great difficulty in pursuing \ntheir rights individually. \n18.  Common questions of law  and fact exist as to all m embers of the Class that \npredominate over any questions that affect  only individual members of the Class.  The \npredominant common questions of law and f act include, without limitation, whether the \nDefendantsโ written and/or  de facto policies of strip-searching individuals who w ere \ncharged with non-indictable offenses or ot her minor crimes when transferred to and \nplaced into the custody of the Salem  County Jail violate the Fourth and Fourteenth \n  5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 6 of 14 PageID: 133\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written and /or de \nfacto policy existed during the Class period. \n19.   P laintiffโs claims are typical of th e claims of the m embers of the Class. \nPlaintiff and all members of the Class have sustained damages arising out of Defendantsโ \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered \nby the Class. \n20.   The representative Plaintiff have  the  requisite persona l  interest in the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  \nPlaintiff has no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n21.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient  \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the indivi dual members of the \nClass is impracticable given the large number of Class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over a large geographical area.    Furthermore,  the expense and burden of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nClass to redress the wrongs done to them .  The cost to the federal court system  of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to  all parties and the court system .  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this ac tion as a class action in this  District presents far fewer  \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n22.  The nam ed Plaintiff has retained c ounsel with substantial experience and \nsuccess in the prosecution of cl ass action and civil rights litig ation.  Plaintiff is being \nrepresented by Jonathan W . Cuneo, Charles J. LaDuca, and Alexandra C. W arren of \n  6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 7 of 14 PageID: 134\nCuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP; Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire of the Law Offi ces of \nElmer Robert Keach, III, PC; Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Locks Law Firm, PLLC \nand  William  Riback, Esquire.  Plain tiffโs  counsel  have  the r esources,  expertise  and \nexperience to successfully prosecute this action against the Defendants.  Plaintiff has no \nconflicts with members of the Class, and  there are no conflicts betw een counsel and \nmembers of the Class. \n23.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the  \nDefendantsโ flagrant violation of the civil rights of detainees, even though the Defendants \nhave maintained their illegal strip-search regimen for at least the past several years. \n24.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, Plaintiff \nseeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P.  23(b)(2), in that all Class m embers were \nsubject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip-searches of individuals charged with \nnon-indictable offenses or other minor crimes that were transported to and placed into the \ncustody of the Salem County Jail.  In short, the Municipal Defendants and the Policy \nMaking Defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to all Class members. \n25.   In addition to, and in the alternative, Plaintiff seeks certification under Rule \n23(b)(3) or seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).  \nFACTS \n \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n \n            26.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials, such as the Policy Makin g Defendants in this action and the em ployees they \nsupervise, from performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with non-\n  7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 8 of 14 PageID: 135\nindictable offenses or other minor crimes unless there is reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband.  \n27.  Salem County, the Sheriffโs Departm ent and the Policy Making Defendants \nhave, nonetheless, instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip-\nsearching all individuals who enter the cust ody of the Salem County J ail, regardless of \nthe nature of their charged crim e and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband.  Upon information \nand belief, detainees are st rip searched upon admission to the Salem County Jail when \nthey receive the jail uniform.  At a minimum, each detainee is forced to disrobe to a state \nof complete undress while being visually observed by a Corrections Officer.  The purpose \nof forcing detainees to completely undress so their naked bodies can be visually observed \nby a Corrections Officer is so that they can be searched for contraband.  Many members \nof the proposed class are also searched in  a more intrusive m anner, where they are \nrequired to bend themselves or manipulate body parts to allow for a visual inspection of \ntheir body cavities.   Further, Salem  County, the Sheriffโs Departm ent, and the Policy \nMaking Defendants have also in stituted a written and/or  de facto policy, custom or \npractice  of conducting visual inspections of   detainees in a state of undress on all  \nindividuals who enter the cust ody of the Correctional Department, regardless of the \nindividual characteristics or  the nature of their charged crim e.  For purposes of this \nAmended Complaint, this practice is collectively referred to as โstrip-searches.โ \n28.  Salem  County, the S heriffโs  Department,  and the Policy Making \nDefendants knew or should have known that th ey may not institute, enforce or perm it \n  8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 9 of 14 PageID: 136\nenforcement of a policy or practice of conduc ting strip-searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion. \n29.   The Defendantsโ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom  \nmandating wholesale strip-searches of all non-indictable offe nses or other minor crimes \nhas been promulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad f aith and contrary to clearly \nestablished law. \n30.   Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip-search may only emanate from the  \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n31.  Salem County, the Sheriffโs Department, and Policy Making Defendants have \npromulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or  de facto \npolicy, practice or custom of strip-searching all individuals placed into the custody of the \nSalem County Jail without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion \nof any sort.  This written and/or  de facto policy made the strip-searching of pre-trial \ndetainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the \narrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of \nthe policy, practice and custom of routine strip-searches.  \n32.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class,  \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip-search upon their entry \ninto the Salem County Jail.  These searches  were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and  in fact were not s upported by reasonable \nsuspicion.   Strip-searches are conducted fo r  individuals arrested for, am ong  other \n  9\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 10 of 14 PageID: 137\ninnocuous offenses such as, traffic violations , outstanding traffic fines and other minor \nfines.  \n33.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-searches conducted  \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip-searches \nโ each member of the Class, includ ing the named Plaintiff โ has suffered or will su ffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n35.  Plaintiffโs experiences are representative of the Class.   \n36.  On or about October 26, 2006, Dana Clark was arrested for failing to appear \nfor court.  Upon her admission to the Salem County Correctional Facility, and as part of \nthe search process, a corrections officer required Clark to remove all of her clothing and a \ntampon, and then to lift her arms and turn around for inspection.  Clark was released two \ndays later, after posting bail.   \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n \n(Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies  \nTo Avoid Constitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law) \n \n38.   Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation  \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 37. \n  39.  The Fourth Am endment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcemen t officers, and prohibits officers from  \nconducting strip-searches of i ndividuals arrested for non-indi ctable offenses or other \n  10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 11 of 14 PageID: 138\nminor crimes absent some particularized suspicion that the individual in question has \neither contraband or weapons. \n  40.  The actions of all Defendants, as de tailed above, violated Plaintiffโs and the \nClassโ rights under the United  States Constitution.  S imply put, it was not  objectively \nreasonable for Correctional Facility personnel  to strip-search Plaintiff and the members \nof the Class based on their arrests for non-indictable or other minor charges.  It was also \nnot objectively reasonable for the Policy Making Defendants to order/direct Correctional \nDepartment personnel to conduct such searches or to have a police or practice permitting \nsuch searches. \n  41.   These strip-searches were conducte d  pursuant to the policy, custom   or \npractice of Salem County and the S heriffโs Department.  As such, these Defendants are \ndirectly liable for the damages of the Class. \n42.  Upon information and belief, Salem County, the Sheriffโs Department, and \nthe  Policy Making Defendants are responsi ble  for  establishing  the polic ies  and \nprocedures  to be utilized in the operati on  of the Correctional Departm ent  and are \nresponsible for the implementation of the strip-search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  \nAs such, Salem County, the Sheriffโs Department, and the Policy Making Defendants are \neach individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and the members of \nthe Class. \n43.  Salem County, the Sheriffโs Depart ment, and the Policy Making Defendants \nknew  that the above-described strip-search   policy was illegal,  and  acted willfully, \nknowingly, and with specific intent to deprive  Plaintiff and the members of the Class of \ntheir Constitutional rights. \n  11\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 12 of 14 PageID: 139\n44. This conduct on the part of all Defenda nts represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n45.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above,  \nPlaintiff and the Class have b een irreparably injured and seek dam ages, as well as the \ndeclaratory and injunctive and relief set out in the Prayer for Relief. \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n46.  The actions of the Policy Making De fendants detailed herein are outrageous, \nin that they continue to propagate an illeg al strip-search policy even though they know \nfor a fact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n47.  It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants have no, or little, respect for the \ncivil rights of individua l citizens or for the rule of  law.  Consequently, an award of \npunitive damages is necessary to p unish the Policy Mak ing Defendants, and to send a \nmessage to them that the requirements of the United States Consti tution also apply to \ngovernment officials in Salem County. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n48. The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  12\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 13 of 14 PageID: 140\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff individually and on behalf of a Class of others similarly \nsituated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23 with Plaintiff as Class representative. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffโs \nCause of Action detailed herein, aw arding Compensatory Damages to the \nnamed Plaintiff and each m ember of the proposed Class in an am ount to be \ndetermined by a Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide \nbasis.  \nC.  A judgment against Policy Making  Defendants on Plaintiffโs Cause of \nAction for punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial. \nD.  A  declaratory judgment against  Salem  County and the Sheriffโs  \nDepartment  declaring their policy, pract ice and custom of strip searching all \ndetainees  entering  the  Correctional  Department,  regardless  of  the crim e \ncharged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nE.  A  preliminary  and perm anent  injunction enjoining Defendants Salem \nCounty  and the Sheriffโs Departm ent  from  continuing to strip search \nindividuals charged with non-indictable or minor crimes and violations absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the search is \nconcealing weapons or other contraband. \n  13\n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 22   Filed 09/28/07   Page 14 of 14 PageID: 141\nF.

INTRODUCTION \n   In a Settlement Agreement executed on December 30, 2008 (Exhibit A to Lesser \nDeclaration) Class Counsel (Charles J. LaDuca and Alexandra C. Warren of Cuneo Gilbert & \nLaDuca LLP, Washington, District of Columbia, Seth Lesser and Fran L. Rudich of Klafter \nOlsen & Lesser, LLP, White Plains, New York, William Riback, of William Riback, LLC, \nHaddonfield, New Jersey, and Elmer Robert Keach, III of the Law Offices of Elmer Robert \nKeach, III, P.C., Amsterdam, New York) have secured a proposed settlement (the \"Settlement\") \nthat provides a fair, reasonable and adequate benefit to individuals admitted to the Salem County \nCorrectional Facility (the \"Correctional Facility\") who were subjected to strip and/or visual \ncavity searches upon their entry to the facility, regardless of the nature of their offense or the \npresence of individualized reasonable suspicion.  The Settlement creates a settlement fund of \n$640,000 for the benefit of in excess of 3,500  class members. The specifics of this relief are set \nforth in a Plan of Distribution that is attached to the parties' Settlement Agreement.  \n   This beneficial Settlement was reached in little more than 18 months after the filing of \nthis case and represents an efficient and salutary result for the Class here on a claim that would \nhave faced significant difficulties at trial and which was obtained from a defendant with a \ncircumscribed ability to pay.  By virtue of the work of former Magistrate Judge Joel Rosen, the \nparties were able to engage in armโs-length negotiation session that took the better part of a year \nand were aided in their positions by virtue of an efficient exchange of information relative to the \nmerits of the case.  Additionally, Judge Rosen and Class Counsel were aided by their extensive \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 9 of 34 PageID: 199\nexperience in litigating and settling similar kinds of strip search cases so that they were able \neffectively to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the case without recourse, in this \ninstance, to extended discovery, all of which would have delayed any recovery by the members \nof the Class.  The parties' good-faith efforts to resolve this litigation ultimately resulted in a \nsettlement representing a thoughtful compromise, which takes into consideration the parties \nrespective concerns -- a meaningful solution to the constitutional violations incurred by the \nmembers of the class and the County's financial status.  \n   In short, Class Counsel respectfully submit that this Settlement is fair, adequate, and \nreasonable for the Settlement Class and that the requirements for final approval will be satisfied. \nIn considering preliminary approval, this is all that the moving party needs to demonstrate in \norder for class members to be notified of this settlement and for a fairness hearing to be \nscheduled.  \n   Finally, the Plaintiff requests that, along with granting preliminarily approval of the \nSettlement, the Court adopt the schedule set forth below, for the parties to effectuate the various \nsteps in the settlement approval process under the Settlement Agreement:  \n  Event   Timing  \n1   Notice Date     No more than sixty (60) d ays after  \n     Preliminary Settlement Approval Date.  \n2   Deadline for filing Requests for   Forty-five (45) days after Notice Date.  \n  Exclusion    \n3   Deadline for filing Objections   Forty-five (45) days after Notice Date.  \n4   Claim Date: deadline by which claims   Ninety (90) days after Notice  \n  must be submitted  Date.  \n5   Fairness Hearing   No later than One Hundred and Fifty (150) days \n    aNfotetric  e Date.  \n     \n   Accordingly, at this preliminary stage of the settlement process, Plaintiff respectfully \nrequests that the Court: (i) grant preliminary approval of the proposed settlement; (ii) certify a \nSettlement Class pursuant to the provisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b) (3); (iii) schedule a fairness \n2  \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 10 of 34 PageID: 200\nhearing to consider final approval, pursuant to the schedule set forth above; (iv) direct that notice \nof the proposed settlement and hearing be provided to absent class members in a manner \nconsistent with the Settlement Agreement and the Notice Plan, as set forth in the above-\nmentioned schedule; and (v) enter the proposed Order for Preliminary Approval. \nII.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND OF CASE \nOn May 14, 2007, Arthur Graff and Dana Clark filed this class action lawsuit against the \nCounty of Salem and several Salem County corrections officials (together, โDefendantsโ) \nregarding Salem County Correctional Facilityโs blanket strip search policies and practices.  The \nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss on August 7, 2007, and in response Plaintiff filed an \namended pleading on September 28, 2007, removing Arthur Graff as a named plaintiff and \nproposed class representative in this matter.  Defendants filed an answer to the amended \ncomplaint on October 10, 2007. \nSettlement negotiations began on March 7, 2008, when the parties met for an initial \nmediation session conducted by retired Magistrate Judge Joel Rosen.  The parties spent extensive \ntime continuing their negotiations after the conclusion of the first round of mediation, pursuant to \nwhich Plaintiff were able to informally continue their investigation of the claims at issue.  As \npart of that effort, Plaintiffโs counsel discovered that the strip searches conducted during the \nadmissions process at the Salem County Correctional Facility were limited to supervised \nshowers, rather than a more intrusive โbend and spreadโ and/or โsquat and coughโ search.1  \nFurther, through the mediation sessions and under the auspices of Judge Rosen, Plaintiff learned \nthat Salem County had limited resources to fund a settlement in this matter. \nThe Settlement Agreement was executed on December 30, 2008.  In connection with the \n                                                 \n1 The โbend and spreadโ or โsquat and cough.โ examination constitutes the more conventional \nunderstanding of the term โstrip search,โ and allows for an inspection of the genital areas.   \n3  \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 11 of 34 PageID: 201\nexecution of the Agreement, the parties prepared for the administration of the settlement, and \ndrafted the class notices and other papers that are part of and attached to the Settlement \nAgreement.  Plaintiff believes that the monetary amount obtained for the benefit of Class \nMembers through the Settlement Agreement represents the limit of Salem Countyโs ability to \npay. \n  III.  BRIEF FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF CASE \n   Plaintiffs claim that the County of Salem and the individual defendants maintained a strip \nsearch policy and practice throughout the class period, pursuant to which all newly admitted pre-\ntrial detainees, including those admitted on non-indictable offenses, were subjected to a \nsupervised shower after being transported to the Salem County Correctional Facility.  This policy \nand practice applied all detainees, without regard to the existence of reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that they were concealing contraband.  The strip searches involved a supervised shower, \nwhereby corrections officers had the ability to view detaineess in a state of complete undress as \npart of the admissions process.  \n  IV.  THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT \n   Class Counsel is pleased to present to the Court Plaintiffโs application for preliminary \napproval of the settlement of this litigation. This Settlement is made on behalf of all persons \nbrought to the Correctional Facility after being charged with non-indictable offenses (or other \nminor crimes) and were subsequently strip searched upon their entry into the facility. The \nproposed Settlement Class is defined as:  \nAll persons who were placed into the custody of the Salem County Correctional \nFacility  after  being  charged  with  non-indictable  offenses,  disorderly  persons \noffenses, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil \ncommitments or other non-indictable occurrences, and who were Strip Searched \nupon  their  entry  into  Salem  County  Correctional  Facility  in  the  absence  of \nreasonable suspicion that the individual harbored contraband.  The class period \n4  \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 12 of 34 PageID: 202\ncommences on May 14, 2005 and extends until December 30, 2008. Specifically \nexcluded  from  the  class  are  Defendants  and  any  and  all  of  their  respective \naffiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n  As described below, the Settlement Agreement provides for the creation of a fund to \ncompensate class members for these constitutional violations. \n     A.    The Settlement Fund  \n  The settlement creates a fund of $640,000 (the \"Settlement Fund\").  Defendants will pay \nthe settlement fund into an escrow account within thirty (30) days of final approval of the \nsettlement by the Court.   \n  All administrative expenses, including the costs of settlement administration, website \nadministration and the provision of notice to class members, as well as the amount awarded by \nthe Court for attorneys' fees and costs and incentive awards to the class representative, will be \ndeducted from the Settlement Fund prior to determining the amount of distribution for class \nmembers.  The exact amount of recovery to each class member, and the timing of such \ndistribution, will be determined by the Plan of Distribution, which is attached as an exhibit to \nthe Settlement Agreement.    \n     B.    Class Notice and Settlement Administration \nBoth the Class Notice and Settlement Administration provided for in the Settlement \nAgreement comport with the requirements of applicable law, Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure and due process. First, all costs associated with publishing notice to the class \nmembers and the administration of the Settlement shall be deducted directly from the settlement \namount before determining the distribution to the Class. Second, notice will be provided to the \nclass by direct mailing of the Class Notice and a Claim Form to all individuals at their last \nknown or readily ascertainable address (in both Spanish and English) and by publication in the \n5  \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 13 of 34 PageID: 203\nTodayโs Sunbeam, The Gloucester County Times, and the Bridgeton News and Millville News, \non at least one day per week for three consecutive weeks commencing on the Notice date, and on \none occasions during the last ten days of the Claims Period.  The mailed notice will be provided \nin Spanish and English, and newspaper advertisements will provide instruction that a Spanish \ncopy of the notice will be provided upon request. \n     C.    Attorneysโ Fees \n  Class Counsel will petition the Court for reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses payable \nfrom the Settlement Fund. The Settlement Agreement currently provides that Class Counsel will \nseek attorneys' fees of thirty percent of the totals Settlement Fund, and an award of pre-\nsettlement litigation expenses in an amount not to exceed $6,000. \nV.    LEGAL ARGUMENT \n       A.   The Settlement Agreement Should Be Preliminarily    \n         Approved By the Court \n  In this motion, Plaintiff seeks preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement between \nPlaintiff and Defendants.  \"Compromises of disputed claims are favored by the courts.\" \nWilliams v. First Nat'l Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595 (1910); In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales \nPractice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 317 (3d Cir. 1998) (\"Prudential IIโ). Settlement \nspares the litigants the uncertainty, delay and expense of a trial, while simultaneously reducing \nthe burden on judicial resources.  Federal Rule 23(e) provides that the Court must approve any \nsettlement of a class action. In a class action, the \"court plays the important role of protector of \nthe [absent members'] interests, in a sort of fiduciary capacity.\" In re Gen. Motors Corp. Pick-up \nTruck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 785 (3rd Cir. 1995) (\"GM Trucks\").  The \nultimate determination whether a proposed class action settlement warrants approval resides in \nthe Court's discretion. Protective Comm. for Indep. S'holders of TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc. v. \n6  \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 14 of 34 PageID: 204\nAnderson, 390 U.S. 414, 424-25 (1968). As discussed more fully below, at this stage of \npreliminary approval, there is clear evidence that the Settlement Agreement is well within the \nrange of possible approval and thus should be preliminarily approved.  \n1.  The standards and procedures for preliminary approval \n \n   Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the mechanism for settling a \nclass action, including, as here, through a class certified for settlement purposes: \nThe claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class may be settled, voluntarily \ndismissed, or compromised only with the court's approval. The following \nprocedures apply to a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise: \n \n(1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to \nall class members who would be bound by the proposal. \n \n(2) If the proposal would bind class members, the court may \napprove it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, \nreasonable, and adequate. \n \n(3) The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying \nany agreement made in connection with the proposal. \n \n(4) If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), \nthe court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a new \nopportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who \nhad an earlier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so. \n \n(5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires \ncourt approval under this subdivision (e); the objection may be \nwithdrawn only with the court's approval. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e); Amchem Prods. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997); Prudential II, 148 \nF.3d at 316.  \n   In determining whether preliminary approval is warranted, the sole issue before the Court \nis whether the proposed settlement is within the range of what might be found fair, reasonable \nand adequate, so that notice of the proposed settlement should be given to class members, and a \n7  \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 15 of 34 PageID: 205\nhearing scheduled to consider final approval.  The Court reviews the proposal preliminarily to \ndetermine whether it is sufficient to warrant public notice and a hearing.  If so, the final decision \non approval is made after the hearing. Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, ยง 13.14, at 172-73 \n(Fed. Jud. Ctr. 2004) (โManual Fourthโ).  The Court is not required at this point to make a final \ndetermination: \nThe judge must make a preliminary determination on the fairness, \nreasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement terms and must direct the \npreparation of notice of the certification, proposed settlement, and date of \nthe final fairness hearing. \n \nId. at ยง 21.632, at 321.  Preliminary approval is the first step in a two-step process required \nbefore a class action may be finally settled.  Id. at 320.  Courts first make a preliminary \nevaluation of the fairness of the settlement, prior to notice.  Id. at 320-21.  In some cases this \ninitial assessment can be made on the basis of information already known to the court and then \nsupplemented by briefs, motions and an informal presentation from the settling parties.  Id. \nThere is an initial strong presumption that a proposed class action settlement is fair and \nreasonable when it is the result of armโs length negotiations. \n   In deciding whether a settlement should be approved under Rule 23, Courts look to \nwhether there is a basis to believe that the more rigorous, final approval standard will be \nsatisfied.  โOnce the judge is satisfied as to the certifiability of the class and the results of the \ninitial inquiry into the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement, notice of a \nformal Rule 23(e) fairness hearing is given to the class members.โ Manual Fourth at ยง 21.633, at \n321.  Preliminary approval permits notice of the hearing on final settlement approval to be given \nto the class members, at which time class members and the settling parties may be heard with \nrespect to final approval.  Id. at 322.  The standard for final approval of a settlement consists of \nshowing that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. E.g., Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 316-\n8  \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 16 of 34 PageID: 206\n17; GM Trucks, 55 F.3d at 785; Stoetzner v. U.S. Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115 (3d Cir. 1990); \nWalsh v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 726 F.2d 956 (3d Cir. 1983); Girsh v. Jepson, 521 \nF.2d 153 (3d Cir. 1975).  \n2.   The settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate  \n \n   The Third Circuit has adopted the following four-factor test to determine the preliminary \nfairness of a class action settlement:  \n  (1)  the negotiations occurred at arm's length;  \n  (2)   there was sufficient discovery;  \n(3)   the proponents of the settlement are experienced in similar litigation; and  \n(4)  only a small fraction of the class objected.  \nGM Trucks, 55 F.3d at 785.2 \n   The Settlement Agreement meets all these tests. First, it is undeniable that it was the \nresult of arm's-length negotiations, conducted by experienced counsel for all parties.  As \ndescribed above, the settlement was negotiated on behalf of Plaintiff by a team of attorneys who \nhave been vigorously prosecuting this and parallel cases for similar claims and were, therefore, \nwell versed in the issues and how to evaluate the claims.  This consideration is often shaped by \nthe experience and reputation of counsel. GM Trucks, 55 F.3d at 787-88; Cotton v. Hinton, 559 \nF.2d 1326 (5th Cir. 1977); In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Antibiotic Antitrust \n                                                 \n2  For final approval, the Court reviews the settlement in light of the factors established by Girsh \nv. Jepson, 521 F.2d 1153, 1157 (3rd Cir. 1975):  (1) the complexity, expense and likely duration \nof the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings \nand the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of \nestablishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the ability \nof the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the \nsettlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; (9) the range of reasonableness of the \nsettlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.  See also In \nre Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d 294, 301 (3d Cir. 2005).  \n9  \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 17 of 34 PageID: 207\nActions, 410 F.Supp. 659 (D.Minn. 1974) (\"The recommendation of experienced antitrust \ncounsel is entitled to great weight.\"); Fisher Brothers v. Phelps Dodge Industries, Inc., 604 F. \nSupp. 446 (E.D. Pa. 1985) (โThe professional judgment of counsel involved in the litigation is \nentitled to significant weight.\"). This settlement was specifically negotiated by experienced \ncounsel to meet all the requirements of Rule 23 and specifically, to provide administrative \nprocedures to assure all class membersโ equal and sufficient due process rights. Accordingly, the \nsettlement was not the product of collusive dealings, but, rather, was informed by the vigorous \nprosecution of the case by the experienced and qualified counsel. Further, continued litigation \nwould be long, complex and expensive, and a burden to Court dockets. Lake v. First National \nBank, 900 F. Supp. 726 (E.D. Pa. 1995) (expense and duration of litigation are factors to be \nconsidered in evaluating the reasonableness of a settlement); Weiss v. Mercedes-Benz of N Am. \nInc., 899 F.Supp. 1297 (D.N.J. 1995) (burden on crowded court dockets to be considered).  \n   Finally, there is no reason to doubt the fairness of the proposed Settlement Agreement. \nNot only was the Settlement Agreement the result of good faith, arm's length negotiations \nbetween experienced and informed counsel on both sides, but the Settlement Agreement and its \nmaterial terms were negotiated with the substantial assistance of a former Magistrate Judge of \nthis Court. See Lesser Decl. ยถ 3.  The proposed Settlement Agreement does not unduly grant \npreferential treatment to the class representative or to segments of the Settlement Class, and it \ndoes not provide excessive compensation to counsel.  See In re Inter-Op Prosthesis Liability \nLitig., 204 F.R.D. 359, 379 (N.D. Ohio 2001). There was no collusion between the negotiating \nparties. Accordingly, the standards for preliminary approval are met in this case and the Court \nshould grant Plaintiffโs motion in its entirety. Id; see also In re NASDAQ MarketMakers \nAntitrust Litig., 176 F.R.D. 99, 102 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).  \n1 0 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 18 of 34 PageID: 208\n   The actual, likely amount to be received by class members is fair and reasonable.  \nBased upon prior precedent, it appears clear that that distribution amount, likely to amount to \nbetween $350 and $950 per settlement class member, is fair and reasonable, given the inherent \nrisks of litigation and the awards in other strip search cases where, as discussed, the claims \ninvolved substantially more invasive forms of strip searches.  The Settlement Agreement gives \nclass members the benefit of compensation without having to prove particular emotional distress \nor the particular circumstances of a search. A person who believes he would be entitled to \nsignificantly more can, of course, opt-out and pursue an independent remedy. The amount \noffered to class members pursuant to the settlement here is fair.  \n    B.  Certification of the Proposed Settlement Class is Appropriate to \nResolve All Strip Search Claims Against Defendants \n   Both the Supreme Court and various circuit courts have recognized the benefits of the \nproposed settlement can only be realized through the certification of a settlement class. See \nAmchem, 521 U.S. at 591; Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 283; Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d \n1011 (9th Cir. 1998). Specifically, the Third Circuit has established a preference for class \ncertification: \"[t]he interests of justice require that in a doubtful case . . . any error, if there is to \nbe one, should be committed in favor of allowing a class action.\" Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d \n770 (3d Cir.1985); see also Walsh v. Pittsburgh Press Co., 160 F.R.D. 527 (W.D. Pa. 1994) \n(same). Looking through the lens of Rule 23(a) and the existing precedents, the Settlement Class \nreadily meets the necessary criteria of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. Given \nthe fact that the Settlement Class consists of approximately 3,472 individuals, there is no \nquestion that the element of numerosity has been met. The commonality and typicality \nrequirements are also easily satisfied, as the claims of the class representative and all class \nmembers are premised upon the same blanket strip search and bail policy and practice. Further, \n1 1 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 19 of 34 PageID: 209\nadequacy of representation is assured as the Class is represented by counsel who have a wealth \nof experience in complex civil rights litigation, including strip search cases of this sort.  \n   Certification of a class under Rule 23(b)(3) for settlement of the compensatory damages \nclaims also is appropriate because all such relief is premised on the common constitutional \nviolations visited on the Class by the Defendants' unlawful strip search policy. There is no \ndanger that individual variations, type or magnitude of damage suffered by individual class \nmembers will affect predominance, as the named plaintiff has suffered the same type of damages \n-- and seeks the same type of relief -- as members of the proposed Class. Moreover, resolution of \nthis litigation by class settlement is superior to the individual adjudication of class members' \nclaims for compensatory relief. In particular, the settlement provides Plaintiff and the Class with \nan ability to obtain prompt, predictable and certain compensatory relief, and contains well \ndefined administrative procedures to assure due process in the application of the agreement to \neach individual claimant including the right to \"opt-out.\"  By contrast, individualized litigation \ncarries with it great uncertainty, risk and costs, and provides no guarantee that the injured \nplaintiff will obtain necessary and timely compensatory relief at the conclusion of the litigation \nprocess. Settlement also would relieve judicial burdens that would be caused by repeated \nadjudication of the same issues in thousands of individualized trials against Salem County.  \n   Other federal courts, in considering the situation where cities or counties have employed \nblanket search policies, have consistently recognized the propriety of certifying such cases as \nclass actions and the decisions certifying such cases are legion. See e.g. Mitchell v. County of \nClinton, 2007 WL 19887126 (N.D.N.Y. July 5, 2007); Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227 \nF.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y. 2005), aff'd, 2005 WL 3117194 (2d Cir. 2005) (class certification, \npreliminary injunction in strip search  class action litigated by present class counsel); Marriott v. \n1 2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 20 of 34 PageID: 210\nCounty of Montgomery, 426 F.

Montgomery Co., 574 F. Supp. 604 \n(D. Md. 1983).  \n     1.    The Elements of Rule 23(a) are Satisfied in the Present Case \n   In order for a lawsuit to be maintained as a class action under Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, the named plaintiff must establish each of the four threshold \nrequirements of subsection (a) of the Rule, which provides:  \nOne  or  more  members  of  a  class  may  sue  or  be  sued  as \nrepresentative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there \nare questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or \ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); see e.g. Barnes v. American Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127 (3d Cir.  \n1998); Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 308-09; Wetzel v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 508 F.2d 239  \n(3d Cir. 1975). Here, all four elements easily are satisfied. \n1 3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 21 of 34 PageID: 211\n       2.  Numerosity Under Rule 23(a)(I) \n   Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be โso numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.โ  Plaintiff is not required to come before the Court and detail, to the person, the \nexact size of the class or to demonstrate that joinder of all class members is impossible. \nโImpracticability does not mean impossibility.โ  Liberty Lincoln Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Mktg. \nCorp., 149 F.RD. 65, 73 (D.N.J. 1993) (\"precise enumeration of the members of a class is not \nnecessary.\"); Zinberg v. Washington Bancorp, Inc., 138 F.R.D. 397, 405 (D.N.J. 1990) (โIt is \nproper for the court to accept common sense assumptions in order to support a finding of \nnumerosity.โ).  Numerosity is indisputable here. During the course of discovery, Defendants \nproduced  booking records for individuals charged with non-indictable offenses.  Because the \nclass size is approximately 4,750 individuals, numerosity is met here.  See also, e.g., Bowers v. \nCity of Philadelphia, 2006 WL 2818501, *2-3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 28, 2006) (numerosity exists \nwhere over 300 individuals had allegedly been subjected to unconstitutional conditions at \nPhiladelphia Prison System facilities and where the proposed class, which includes future \ndetainees, could include thousands of people); Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 171 (finding numerosity \nin strip search class action where proposed class numbered over 2,000 individuals).  \n      3.    Commonality Under Rule 23(a)(2) \n   Rule 23(a)(2) requires that there be \"questions of law or fact common to the class.\" The \ncommonality requirement is met if Plaintiffs' grievances share a common question of law or of \nfact. Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994). Rather than requiring that all questions \nof law or fact be common, Rule 23 only requires that \"the questions of law or fact common to the \nmembers of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\" Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  A Plaintiff is not required to show that all class members' claims are \n1 4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 22 of 34 PageID: 212\nidentical to each other as long as there are common questions at the heart of the case.  \"Factual \ndifferences among the claims of the putative class members do not defeat certification.\" Baby \nNeal, 43 F .3d at 56; Prudential II, 148 F.3d 283. Indeed, a single common question is sufficient \nto satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(2). See 1 Robert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions, ยง \n3.10, at 3-50 (1992); accord Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56. A party is entitled to certification where \nthe class claims arise \"from a 'common nucleus of operative fact' regardless of whether the \nunderlying facts fluctuate over the class period and vary as to individual claimants.\" In re \nAsbestos Sch. Litig., 104 F.R.D. 422, 429 (E.D. Pa. 1984).  \n   Applying these principles, it becomes manifest that the commonality requirement of \nsubsection (a)(2) is easily met here. The central issues posed by this litigation are: a) did the \nsupervised shower regimen that Defendants had constitute an unconstitutional blanket strip \nsearch policy and/or practice during the class period; b) are Defendants responsible for these \nConstitutional violations? Given the presence of these common questions central to this \nlitigation, Rule 23(a)(2)'s requirement for the existence of common questions of fact or law has \nbeen met here. See Dodge, 226 F.R.D. at 180-181 (commonality exists where all members of the \nclass contend that a blanket strip search policy exists, where all members contend that the policy \nis illegal, and where all members of the class claim they were searched pursuant to the policy \nwhich was uniformly applied to all detainees); Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172 (finding commonality \nwhere the representative parties and the members of the proposed class had the same legal claims \nbased upon the same official procedure); see also Sutton v. Hopkins County, 2007 WL 119892 \n*4 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, 2007) (\"Plaintiffs have alleged that the Defendants had a policy, custom, \nor practice of strip-searching persons on admission to and/or just prior to release from the \nHopkins County Jail without regard to whether there existed the requisite individual, reasonable \n1 5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 23 of 34 PageID: 213\nsuspicion required by law. Given this allegation, the existence and constitutionality of the \ncounty's policy, custom or practice are common questions.\"). This point was recently clarified by \nthis Court in Bowers v. City of Philadelphia, 2006 WL 281850 *2-3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 28, 2006). In \nBowers, pretrial detainees in the custody of the Philadelphia Prison System brought a class action \nalleging severe overcrowding and dangerous, unhealthy and degrading conditions. Judge Surrick \ngranted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, noting that commonality had been \nestablished where \"all class members are or will be subjected to the conditions alleged ... all of \nwhich result from the overall claim of unconstitutional overcrowding\" and where \"all members \nof the class raise common questions of law\" involving the constitutionality of the Jail's practices \nand policies. Id.  \n       4.   Typicality Under Rule 23(a)(3) \n   Rule 23(a)(3) requires that the representative plaintiff's claims be \"typical\" of those of \nother class members.  The commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) \"tend to \nmerge.\" Gen.Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.l3 (1982).  The requirement of \nthis subdivision of the rule, along with the adequacy of representation requirement set forth in \nsubsection (a)( 4), is designed to assure that the interests of unnamed class members will be \nprotected adequately by the named class representative. Id.; Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 311; \nBogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1977); Asbestos School Litigation, 104 F.R.D. \nat 429-30. The typicality requirement \"is satisfied when each class member's claim arises from \nthe same course of events, and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the \ndefendant's liability.\" Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372 (2d Cir.1997).  \"Factual differences \nwill not render a claim atypical if the claim arises from the same event or practice of course of \nconduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members, and it is based on the same legal \n1 6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 24 of 34 PageID: 214\ntheory.\" Hayworth v. Blondery Robinson & Co., 980 F.2d 912, 923 (3d Cir. 1992).  Typicality is \ndemonstrated where the plaintiff can \"show that two issues of law or fact he or she shares in \ncommon with the class occupy the same degree of centrality to his or her claims as to those of \nunnamed class members.\" Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786, 809-10 (3d Cir. 1984); see also \nBlihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 617 (applying this principle to a strip search class action). The typicality \nrequirement has been liberally construed by the federal courts. Scholes v. Stone, McGuire & \nBenjamin, 143 F.R.D. 181, 185 (N.D. Ill. 1992).  \n   Here, the Representative Plaintiffโs claims are typical of the claims of the Class. Dana \nClarkโs claims arise from the same course of events and she would have to make the same or \neffectively the same arguments to prosecute his claims as would be made by members of the \nproposed Class. Typicality is satisfied because the \"[D]efendants acted pursuant to a policy that \ncalled for indiscriminate searches. If this allegation is true, then the named [P]laintiffs would be \nsimilarly situated to the other members of the class.\" Blihovde, 29 F.R.D. at 617; Bowers, 2006 \nWL 2818501 *2-3 (\"A plaintiffโs claim is typical if it arises from the same event or course of \nconduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and is based on the same legal \ntheory.\"); see also Weisfeld v. Sun Chern. Corp., 210 F.R.D. 136, 140 (D.N.J. 2002) (\"[I]n \ninstances wherein it is alleged that the defendants engaged in a common scheme relative to all \nmembers of the class there is a strong assumption that the claims of the representative parties \nwill be typical of the absent class members.\")(citation omitted); Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172 \n(finding typicality even where the claims of the representative parties involved a more detailed \nsearch than other class members, because they were conducted pursuant to the same policy); \nSutton, 2007 WL 117892 at *4 (\"Because each named Plaintiff alleges an unconstitutional strip \n1 7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 25 of 34 PageID: 215\nsearch after arrest for a minor violation or before release from jail, the claims of the \nrepresentatives are typical of the class as a whole.\").  \n      5.    Adequacy Under Rule 23(a)(4) \n   The final requirement of Rule 23(a) is set forth in subsection (a)(4), which requires that \n\"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" The Third \nCircuit consistently has ruled that:  \nAdequate representation depends on two factors: (a) the plaintiff's \nattorney  must  be  qualified,  experienced  and  generally  able  to \nconduct the proposed litigation; and (b) the plaintiff must not have \ninterests antagonistic to those of the class.  \nWeiss, 745 F.2d at 811 (quoting Wetzel v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 508 F.2d at 247);  \nsee also Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 312. These two components are designed to ensure  \nthat absentee class members' interests are fully pursued. The existence of the elements of  \nadequate representation are presumed and \"the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate  \nthat the representation will be inadequate.\" Asbestos School Litigation, 104 F.R.D. at  \n430 (citing Lewis v. Curtis, 671 F.2d 779 (3d Cir. 1982)); Cook v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 151 \nF.R.D. 378 (D. Colo. 1993) (quoting 2 Robert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions, ยง7.24 at pp. \n7-81, 2-82, 3d ed. 1998).  \n   Dana Clark and Class Counsel have fairly and adequately represented the Class here, \nespecially judging by the excellent settlement achieved in this litigation. Indeed, in the present \ncase, the presumption of adequate representation cannot be rebutted. With respect to the issue of \nadequacy of counsel, the Court may take judicial notice of the fact that Class Counsel have \nsubstantial experience in litigating complex civil rights actions and were the counsel, for instance \nin the Hicks v. County of Camden case and the Suggs v. Cumberland case, both which received \nfinal approval from this Court this year.  Counsel have also successfully settled other such cases.  \n1 8 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 26 of 34 PageID: 216\nSee Kahler v. County of Rensselaer, No. 03-cv-1324 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (preliminary approval \norder in strip search class action settlement, litigated by present class counsel; class settlement \nlater granted final approval); Marriott, 426 F. Supp.2d at 1 (class certification granted by U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of New York, and, by subsequent decision, summary \njudgment granted in favor of the class, class settlement preliminarily approved); McDaniel v. \nCounty of Schenectady, No. 04-cv-0757 (preliminary approval and certification of settlement \nclass in strip search class action, class settlement finally approved on September 5, 2007); Kelsey \nv. County of Schoharie, 2007 WL 603406 (N.D.N.Y. February 21, 2007); Mitchell, 2007 WL \n1988716 (N.D.N.Y. July 5, 2007) (class certification granted).   See also Lesser Decl. Ex. B (bios \nand resumes). \n   As to the second issue, there is nothing to suggest that Dana Clark has significant \ninterests antagonistic to those of the absent class members in the vigorous pursuit of the class \nclaims against Salem County. See Dietrich v. Bauer, 192 F.R.D. 119, 126 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) \n(\"gauging the adequacy of representation requires an assessment whether the class \nrepresentatives have interests antagonistic to those of the class they seek to represent\"). Plaintiff \nClark seeks to obtain appropriate compensation from Defendants for herself and for the members \nof the proposed class.  Ms. Clark has come forward to represent the Class under personal \npressure - as being subject to a situation as a supervised shower and possibly being forced to \nrelive it could be difficult for anyone. Ms. Clarkโs \"interests in this case coincide with those of \nthe potential class members in that [Plaintiffs seek] a declaration that the practices, policies, and \nconditions complained of in the [Class Action] Complaint are unconstitutional and seek \ninjunctive relief prohibiting the continuation of those\" policies. Bowers, 2006 WL 2818501 *6-8. \nIndeed, she has obtained an advantageous settlement that treats all members of the Class in the \n1 9 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 27 of 34 PageID: 217\nsame fashion, and provides real value to all. In nearly identical circumstances and given the \ncommon legal and factual issues, courts have deemed plaintiffs in similar cases to be adequate \nclass representatives. See e.g., Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172.  \n   Having demonstrated that each of the mandatory requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied \nhere, Plaintiff now turns to consideration of the factors which, independently, justify class \ntreatment of this action under subdivision 23(b)(3) of the rule.  \nC.  The Requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) Are Met in the Settlement \nContext  \n   Plaintiffโs proposed class also meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). Under 23(b)(3) a \nclass action may be maintained if:  \nthe court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the \nmembers of the class predominate over any questions affecting \nonly individual members, and that a class action is superior to \nother available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of \nthe controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) \nthe interest of members of the class in individually controlling the \nprosecution  or  defense  of  separate  actions;  (B)  the  extent  and \nnature  of  any  litigation  concerning  the  controversy  already \ncommenced  by  or  against  members  of  the  class;  (C)  the \ndesirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the \nclaims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be \nencountered in the management of a class action.  \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  \n \n   \"The Rule 23(b )(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently \ncohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 623. Although Rule \n23(b)(3) requires that common issues of law and fact predominate, it does not require that there \nbe an absence of any individual issues. In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litig., 73 F.R.D., 322, 344 \n(E.D. Pa. 1976). The Court must find that \"the group for which certification is sought seeks to \nremedy a common legal grievance.\" Hochschuler v. G.D. Searle & Co., 82 F.R.D. 339 (N.D. Ill. \n2 0 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 28 of 34 PageID: 218\n1978); Dietrich, 192 F.R.D. 119 (in determining whether common issues of fact predominate, \"a \ncourt's inquiry is directed primarily toward whether the issue of liability is common to members \nof the class\"). Rule 23(b)(3) does not require that all questions of law or fact be common. See In \nre Telectronics Pacing Systems, 172 F.R.D. 271, 287-88 (S.D. Ohio 1997). In this regard, courts \ngenerally focus on the liability issues and if these issues are common to the class, common \nquestions are held to predominate over individual questions. See id. \n   Here, the proposed class members' claims involve one central legal question: was the  \nsupervised showering and claimed strip searching of every pretrial detainee admitted to the \nSalem County Correctional Facility without regard to the crime charged or the circumstances of \narrest, constitutional? The Classโs claims also share common factual issues - did this practice \nexist during the class period and are the Defendants legally responsible for this practice? Proof of \nthese issues, with a goal to answering the two core legal questions, would be the undoubted focus \nof any trial. Clearly, legal and factual issues in this litigation predominate over any of the Ms. \nClarkโs individual issues.  \n   Given the nature of this action and the fact that a substantial proportion of the class \nmembership is comprised of economically disenfranchised individuals, a class action is also the \nsuperior method by which to adjudicate claims of individual class members. Poor and \nmarginalized class members are unlikely to be able to litigate their cases individually. See Mack, \n191 F.R.D. at 25; D'Alauro v. GC Services Ltd, 168 F.R.D. 451, 458 (E.D.N.Y. 1996); In re \nNassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 230 (2d Cir. 2006); Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 7 \n(\"class status here is not only the superior means, but probably the only feasible one ... to \nestablish liability and perhaps damages\"). The class action device is designed for the situation \nwhere an individual seeks to vindicate \"the rights of groups of people who individually would be \n2 1 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 29 of 34 PageID: 219\nwithout effective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.\" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 617. \n\"The policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small \nrecoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his \nor her rights. A class action solves this problem by aggregating the relatively paltry potential \nrecoveries into something worth someone's (usually an attorney's) labor.\" Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 25 \n(internal citations omitted); Yang v. Odum, 392 F.3d 97, 106 (3d Cir. 2004); Marriott, 227 \nF.R.D. at 173; Sutton, 2007 WL 119892 *9 (\"litigating the existence of a uniform policy for the \nclass as a whole would both reduce the range of issues and promote judicial economy.\")(internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).  \n   Considerations of judicial economy particularly underscore the superiority of the class \naction mechanism in this case. The prosecution of this case as a class action is superior to \npossibly hundreds of individual cases being filed in this Court, each of which would be \nrepetitious and possibly yield inconsistent adjudications. See Califano v. Yamaski, 42 U.S. 682, \n700-701 (1979); Dodge, 226 F.R.D. at 183 (\"Where a single issue (such as the existence of a \nuniform policy) is guaranteed to come up time and time again, issues of judicial economy \nstrongly militate in favor of resolving that issue via a techniques that will bind as many persons \nas possible.\"); Sutton, 2007 WL 119892 *9 (holding that \"a class action provides the most \nfeasible and efficient method of determining liability\" where suit alleges existence if a uniform \nunconstitutional strip search policy). The trial in this action would last for weeks, with scores of \nfacility employees being examined about the practices of the Salem County Correctional Facility \nin an effort to establish municipal liability. Even having a small proportion of class members \nhave duplicative trials on this issue would be an enormous waste of judicial resources, and would \nnot be the superior and appropriate way to resolve this controversy.  \n2 2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 30 of 34 PageID: 220\n   Settlement on a class basis also is superior individual litigation and adjudication because \nsettlement provides class members with prompt compensation for their damages, whether those \ndamages exist now or manifest themselves sometime in the future. By contrast, compensation \nresulting from litigation is highly uncertain and may not be received before lengthy trial and \nappellate proceedings are complete. In addition, the settlement obviously removes the \noverwhelming and redundant costs of individual trials. \n   Accordingly, the Settlement Agreement renders a class action superior to other potential \navenues of recovery for the Class. Therefore, this case presents the paradigmatic example of a \ndispute which can be resolved to effectuate the fundamental goals of Rule 23: (1) to promote \njudicial economy through the efficient resolution of multiple claims in a single action; and (2) to \nprovide persons with smaller claims, who would otherwise be economically precluded from \ndoing so, the opportunity to assert their rights. Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & \nProcedure: Civil 2d ยง 1754. Moreover, unless class members obtain relief through the \nsettlement, most of them will not obtain any relief at all. It would be inconceivable for every one \nof the thousands of potential plaintiffs to conduct expensive and extensive discovery to prove \nliability under the legal theories proffered in the complaint for a potential individual recovery of \ndamages. See In re Kirschner Medical Corp. Sec. Litig., 139 F.R.D. 74, 83 (D. Md. 1991) (class \nsuits superior when individual claims are too small to warrant individual suit). At the same time, \nthe settlement fully preserves the due process rights of each individual plaintiff seeking \ncompensatory damages.  \n   In sum, the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) are satisfied and certification of the proposed \nClass is appropriate.  \n \n2 3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 31 of 34 PageID: 221\n     D.    The Court Should Direct Notice to the Class \n   Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), class members are entitled to notice of any proposed \nsettlement before it is ultimately approved by the Court. Manual for Complex Litigation Third \n(1995) ยง30.212. The Settlement Agreement provides for reasonable notice to prospective class \nmembers in that it requires notice to be provided by mail, newspaper, television, and the Internet.  \n   Under Rule 23(e) and the relevant due process considerations, adequate notice must be \ngiven to all absent class members and potential class members to enable them to make an \nintelligent choice as to whether to opt-out of the class. Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 326-27; \nValentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227 (9th Cir. 1996). However, neither Rule 23 or \ndue process considerations requires actual notice to every class member in every case, Phillips \nPetroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 812 (1985), but simply calls for \"notice reasonably \ncertain to reach most of those interested in objecting is likely to safeguard the interests of all.\" \nId.   Nevertheless, Plaintiffโs notice plan has been developed with the thought of providing \nnotice possible to \"reach\" all class members and in a form of notice that has been approved on \nseveral occasions by this and other Courts.  \n   The federal courts have sanctioned a variety of public notices to ensure that absent \nmembers are aware of the class and are capable of making an informed choice. In the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, the federal court found that utilizing the mass media and posting \nnotices in prisons gave adequate notice to absent class members in a civil rights action regarding \nthe overcrowding of prisons. Harris v. Reeves, 761 F.Supp. 383 (E.D. Pa. 1991). For instance, in \nthe Second Circuit, the parties sought the aid of the mass media and the state governments to \nprovide adequate notice to the absent class members. In re Agent Orange Prod Liability \nLitigation, 818 F.2d 145, 169 (2nd Cir. 1987). In the Northern District of Georgia, the federal \n2 4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 32 of 34 PageID: 222\ncourt sanctioned publication in 100 of the largest cities in the United States and through a public \nawareness program. The public awareness program included news releases through the broadcast \nmedia and the print media. See In re Domestic Air Trasp. Antitrust Litigation, 141 F.R.D. 534 \n(N.D. Ga. 1992). Through those sophisticated publications, the courts found Rule 23(e) and due \nprocess have been satisfied.  \n   In this case, counsel for the Settlement Class will obtain a last known address, date of \nbirth, and social security number (if possible) for each Settlement Class Member. Notice will be \nprovided to the Class by direct mailing of Class Notice and a Claim Form to all individuals at \ntheir last known or readily ascertainable address.  There will be, in addition, publication notice, \nas described.  Moreover, the Settlement Administrator will also provide a copy of the Class \nNotice and Claim Form to anyone who requests notice through written communication, through \na dedicated internet website, and through a toll-free number to be established. Through these \nextensive efforts, absent class members will receive adequate notice of the Settlement. See \nZimmer Paper Products, Inc. v. Berger & Montague, P.C., 758 F.2d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 1985) (\"It is \nwell-settled that in the usual situation first class mail and publication fully satisfy the notice \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ.P. 23 and the due process clause.\"); see also Cayuga Indian Nation \nv. Carey, 89 F.R.D. 627, 633 (N.D.N.Y. 1981) (\"individual notice by first class mail, coupled \nwith notice by publication, satisfied the requirements of due process and Rule 23\").  \n   Finally, this Notice will include all necessary legal requirements and provide a \ncomprehensive explanation of the Settlement in simple, non-legalistic terms.  \n     E.   A Final Fairness Hearing Should be Scheduled \n   The Court should schedule a final fairness hearing to determine that class certification is \nproper and to approve the settlement. See Manual for Complex Litigation, Third ยง30.44 (1995).  \n2 5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-1   Filed 12/30/08   Page 33 of 34 PageID: 223\nThe fairness hearing will provide a forum to explain, describe or challenge the terms and \nconditions of the class certification and settlement, including the fairness, adequacy and \nreasonableness of the settlement. Accordingly, Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule the time, \ndate, and place of the final fairness hearing.  \n  VI.     CONCLUSION \n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order: \n(1) conditionally certifying a class action with respect to the claims against Defendants pursuant \nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) for the purpose of effectuating a class action settlement of the claims \nagainst Defendants; (2) preliminarily approving a class settlement with Defendants; (3) directing \nnotice to class members regarding settlement of certain claims against Defendants on a final and \ncomplete basis; and (4) scheduling a final fairness hearing.  \nDated: December 30, 2008      Respectfully submitted, \n \n            /s/ Seth Lesser          \n___________________________________ \n            Seth Lesser  \n            Fran Rudich \n            Klafter Olsen & Lesser LLP \n            1311 Mamaroneck Avenue, Suite 220               \n            White Plains, NY 10605 \n            Telephone:    914-997-5656 \n            Telecopier:    914-997-2444   \n \nCharles LaDuca       \n  Alexandra C.

LESSER IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT \n \nSETH R. LESSER, an attorney admitted to the bar of this Court, declares, under \npenalty of perjury that: \n1.  I am a partner in Klafter Olsen & Lesser LLP co-counsel for Plaintiff Dana \nClark, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated.  I am fully familiar with the \nfacts and circumstances set forth herein, and I make this Declaration in support of the Motion \nfor Preliminary Approval of Settlement, as well as for the sending of notice and the \nscheduling of a final approval hearing. \n2.  This case was commenced in May 2007 by the filing of a complaint by Arthur \nGraff and Dana Clark.  The Defendants thereupon filed a motion to dismiss on August 7, 2007, \nand in response Plaintiff filed an amended pleading on September 28, 2007, removing Arthur \nGraff as a named plaintiff and proposed class representative in this matter.  Defendants filed an \nanswer to the amended complaint on October 10, 2007. \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-2   Filed 12/30/08   Page 2 of 3 PageID: 226\n3.  As my co-counsel and I have been involved in the prosecution and settlement of \nother similar cases, from the initial pretrial conference onwards it was suggested that a mediation \neffort could save both sides time and money and also, if nothing else, help focus the partiesโ \nunderstanding of the claims and defenses in the case.  Settlement negotiations began on March 7, \n2008, when the parties met for an initial mediation session conducted by retired Magistrate Judge \nJoel Rosen.  The parties spent extensive time continuing their negotiations after the conclusion of \nthe first round of mediation, pursuant to which Plaintiff were able to informally continue their \ninvestigation of the claims at issue.  As part of the mediation effort, Plaintiffโs counsel \ndiscovered that the strip searches conducted during the admissions process at the Salem County \nCorrectional Facility were limited to supervised showers, rather than a more intrusive โbend and \nspreadโ and/or โsquat and coughโ search, as has been the case in other counties  Further, through \nthe mediation sessions and under the auspices of Judge Rosen, Plaintiff learned that Salem \nCounty had extremely limited resources to fund a settlement in this matter.  The settlement \nmediation and discussions between the parties continued over many months, practically down to \nthe signing of the Settlement Agreement today, on December 30, 2008. \n4.  The foregoing items, including the scope of the claims and the financial status of \nthe County were matters that were carefully considered by Plaintiffโs counsel in negotiation of, \nand deliberations concerning, the propriety of the Settlement Agreement that was ultimately \nreached.  Plaintiffโs counsel believes that the monetary amount obtained for the benefit of Class \nMembers through the Settlement Agreement represents the limit of Salem Countyโs ability to \npay and that the Settlement Agreement amount is a fair and reasonable one for the Class. \n5.

SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION OF THE COURT \nBy signing below, I agree that the United States District Court for the District of \nNew Jersey has the power to rule on my claim as a Settlement Class Member, and that the \nCourt has the power to enforce the Release described below. \nRELEASE \n \nBy signing below, you acknowledge the release and discharge of the Defendants, \nand all of their respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors and \nassigns, officers, agents, representatives, attorneys and employees, from any and all claims \nor causes of action that were, could have been, or should have been asserted by the named \nPlaintiffs or any member of the Settlement Class against the Released Persons, or any of \nthem, based upon or related to strip searches in the Salem County Jail. \nVERIFICATION \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the \nforegoing information provided by the undersigned is true and correct. I also declare that I \nwas strip searched when I was admitted into the Salem County Jail for a non-indictable \noffense. \nI filled out and signed this Proof of Claim and Release form on ____________________, \n2009, in ______________________________ (City, State, Country). \n \n_____________________________________ \n(Sign your name here)   \n \n_____________________________________ \n(Type/Print your name here) \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-5   Filed 12/30/08   Page 1 of 11 PageID: 256\n  Legal Notice \n  United States District Court for the District of New Jersey \n \n  NOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING \n \nIf You Were Admitted Into The Salem County Correctional \nFacility From May 14, 2005 To December 30, 2008 For a Non-\nIndictable Offense And Were Strip Searched Upon Arrival, Then \nYour Rights Could Be Affected By A Proposed Class Action \nSettlement.    \n \n  The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey authorized this \nnotice.  It is not from a lawyer.  You are not being sued. \n \no  This is a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging that corrections \nofficers employed at the Salem County Correctional Facility engaged in the strip \nsearches of all individuals charged only with non-indictable offenses, violations, \ntraffic infractions, failing to make payment on outstanding traffic violations, \nfailing to make payment on outstanding fines, failing to make child support \npayments or other minor offenses or violations upon their entry into the Salem \nCounty Correctional Facility from May 14, 2005 until December 30, 2008.  The \nproposed settlement does not include individuals who were charged with an \nindictable offense at the time of their admission to the Salem County Correctional \nFacility, or who were not strip searched when they entered the Correctional \nFacility.   \n \no  The settlement would entitle each Class Member to an equal share of a $640,000 \nsettlement fund (after payment of administrative costs, an incentive award to the \nrepresentative plaintiff, and attorneysโ fees).     \n \no  It is estimated that each Class Member may receive between $350.00 and \n$950.00.  The maximum payment to each Class Member will be $950.00, and \nDefendants may receive some money back from the Settlement Fund.  This is \ndetailed later in this notice. \n \no  Visit the settlement website at [INSERT] for additional details about the \nsettlement.  You may also get additional information by calling 1-800 [insert \nphone #] or by writing to [insert address].   \n \no  Your legal rights are affected whether you act or donโt act.  Read this notice \ncarefully. \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-5   Filed 12/30/08   Page 2 of 11 PageID: 257\n \n \n \n \nYOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT: \n   \nSubmit a Claim Form  You must submit a Claim Form to receive payment \nunder the settlement.  You must submit a Claim \nForm by [insert date] to receive any money. \n   \nExclude Yourself  If you exclude yourself from the settlement, you \nwill not be bound by the settlement or judgment \nand will not be entitled to a cash payment.  You \nwill be free to pursue your claims against the \nDefendants.  This is the only option that allows you \nto bring or be part of any other lawsuit against the \nDefendants in this case about the same legal claims \nthat are advanced in this case.  You must exclude \nyourself from the settlement by [Insert Date].  \n   \nObject  If you do not exclude yourself, you may write to \nthe Court about why you do not like the settlement \nor the request for legal fees and costs.  You must \nsend a written objection to the Court \npostmarked no later than [Insert Date].  \n   \nGo to a Hearing  If you submit a claim form or if you object, you \nmay also ask to speak in Court at the Fairness \nHearing (described below) about the fairness of the \nsettlement or the request for fees and costs.   You \ndo not need to go to the hearing if you do not wish \nto.  You do not need to go to the hearing if you \nsubmit a claim, or if you exclude yourself or if you \nobject.  \n   \nDo Nothing  You get no payment.  You give up your right to sue \nDefendants on these claims later.   \n \no  These rights and options - and the deadlines to exercise them - are explained in \nthis notice. \n \no  The Court in charge of this case still must decide whether to give final approval to \nthe settlement.  Likewise, payments to class members will be distributed only if \nthe Court grants final approval of the settlement and after any appeals are \nresolved.  \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-5   Filed 12/30/08   Page 3 of 11 PageID: 258\nI.   WHY DID I GET THIS NOTICE PACKAGE? \nYou or someone in your family may have been admitted to the Salem County \nCorrectional Facility on non-indictable offenses, violations, traffic infraction, failing to \nmake payment on outstanding traffic violation, failing to make child support payments, \nfailing to make payment on outstanding fine or other minor crime or violation from May \n14, 2005 to December 30, 2008 and may have been subjected to a strip search.  \nYou were sent this notice because you have the right to know about a proposed \nsettlement of a class action lawsuit, and about your options, before the Court decides \nwhether to approve the settlement.  If the Court approves it, and after any possible \nobjections and appeals are resolved, an administrator appointed by the Court will make \nthe monetary payments that the settlement allows.  You will be informed of the progress \nof the settlement.  You should understand that the process of Court approval may take a \ngood deal of time.   \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits \nare available, who is eligible for them and how to get them.   \nThe Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the District \nof New Jersey, Camden Vicinage, United States District Judge Renee Marie Bumb \npresiding.  The case is called Graff v. County of Salem, Index No. 07-CV-2259.  The \nperson who sued is called the Plaintiff, and the municipality and municipal officials she \nsued, the County of Salem, its correctional employees and elected officials, are called the \nDefendants. \nII.   WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT? \nPlaintiff claims in this lawsuit that the County of Salem illegally strip searched \nindividuals upon their admission to the Salem County Correctional Facility who were \ncharged solely with non-indictable offenses, violations, traffic infractions, failing to make \npayment on outstanding traffic violations, failing to make payment on outstanding fines, \nfailing to make child support payments or other minor offenses or violations and not \nindictable occurrences, in violation of the unreasonable search provisions of the United \nStates Constitution. Defendants deny that they did anything wrong, and contended \nthrough this lawsuit that even if they did do anything wrong, Plaintiff and the Class \nMembers are not entitled to any money as a result of being searched.   \n \nIII.   WHY IS THIS A CLASS ACTION? \nIn a class action, one or more people, called the Class Representative (in this case, \nDana Clark) sues on behalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of these people are \na Class or Class Members.  A class action resolves the issues for all Class Members, \nexcept for those who exclude themselves from the Class.  United States District Judge \nRenee Marie Bumb is in charge of this class action lawsuit. \n \nIV.      WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiff or Defendants.  Instead, both sides \nagreed to a settlement.  That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-5   Filed 12/30/08   Page 4 of 11 PageID: 259\naffected will get compensation.  The Class Representative and her attorneys think the \nsettlement is best for everyone who is alleged to have been illegally strip searched.   \n \nV.   HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM PART OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nJudge Bumb decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:   \nAll persons who were placed into the custody of the Salem County Correctional \nFacility after being charged with non-indictable offenses, disorderly persons offenses, \nviolations, , traffic infractions, civil commitments or other non-indictable occurrences, \nand who were Strip Searched upon their entry into Salem County Correctional Facility in \nthe absence of reasonable suspicion that the individual harbored contraband.  The class \nperiod commences on May 14, 2005 and extends until December 30, 2008. For purposes \nof class definition, multiple entries into the facility shall be viewed as a single entry. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their respective \naffiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \nThe settlement does not cover individuals charged with indictable offenses at the \ntime of their entry into the Salem County Correctional Facility, anyone who entered the \nCorrectional Facility after being convicted of (as compared to only being charged with) a \ncrime, or anyone who entered the Correctional Facility but was not strip searched as part \nof the Correctional Facilityโs booking procedure.  \nVI.       DO I NEED TO PROVE THAT I WAS STRIP-SEARCHED, AND WHAT \nDOES THAT MEAN? \nIn filling out the Claim Form, you will affirm, under penalty of perjury, that you \nwere strip searched during the admission process at the Salem County Correctional \nFacility.  If your name is not contained in Salem Countyโs records, you may be asked to \nprovide additional documentation before being allowed to participate in the settlement.   \nA strip search occurred if, during the admission process, you were ordered to \nremove or rearrange your clothing for a visual inspection of your undergarments, \nbuttocks, anus, genitals or breasts. A strip search did not occur if the removal or \nrearrangement of your clothing was reasonably required to render medical treatment or \nassistance If you were searched in this manner when you were booked into the facility, \nyou are a member of the Class and entitled to make a claim.  You will need to provide an \naffirmation on the Claim Form confirming that one of these searches was conducted on \nyou when you entered the Salem County Correctional Facility. \nVIII.    HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER THE OFFENSE FOR WHICH I WAS \nCHARGED UPON ADMISSION TO THE SALEM COUNTY \nCORRECTIONAL FACILITY QUALIFIES ME FOR INCLUSION IN \nTHE CLASS? \n  You must have been brought to the Salem County Correctional Facility before a \njudge had sentenced you (pre-adjudication) to be eligible to recover, and all of the \ncharges must have been non-indictable offenses.  Everyone brought to the Salem County \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-5   Filed 12/30/08   Page 5 of 11 PageID: 260\nCorrectional Facility pre-adjudication based solely on non-indictable offenses and who \nwere strip searched upon admission are eligible under this settlement agreement. \n \n  Stated another way, persons who were charged with โindictable offensesโ as \ndefined under the New Jersey Criminal Code, N.J.S.A. 2C when they were admitted to \nthe Salem County Correctional Facility cannot recover.  New Jersey defines an indictable \noffense as an offense, which authorizes in excess of six months jail time if convicted.  \nIndictable offenses are usually handled by a Superior Court Judge, and require indictment \nby a grand jury.  Murder, burglary and rape are examples of indictable offenses.  Anyone \ncharged with an indictable offense upon admission to the Salem County Correctional \nFacility, even if they were also charged with non-indictable offenses at the same time, is \nnot a member of the class unless they were, on another occasion, admitted to the Salem \nCounty Correctional Facility solely on non-indictable or violation charges. \n  Examples of โnon-indictable offensesโ are disorderly persons offenses traffic \noffenses and violation of child support orders.  Disorderly persons offenses are non-\nindictable offenses and are, at most, subject to incarceration in a County Jail.  Non-\nindictable offenses are handled by a Municipal Court or City, Town or Village Court \njudge, and do not require indictment.  Shoplifting less than $200.00, Disorderly Conduct, \nand Loitering are examples of charges, which are non-indictable offenses, and fall within \nthe class definition.  Anyone charged with such a non-indictable offense and upon \nadmission to the Salem County Correctional Facility was strip searched is a member of \nthe Class. \n  The settlement further allows for individuals to make claims if they were admitted \nto the Salem County Correctional Facility if they were subject to a civil commitment.  A \ncivil commitment is an order from a non-criminal court, usually the Chancery Court, \ncommitting that individual to the Salem County Correctional Facility.  Individuals \nadmitted to the Salem County Correctional Facility, on a civil commitment, a \ncommitment, are members of the Class if they were strip searched.  \n  Finally, if a person was arrested and brought to the Salem County Correctional \nFacility under traffic offenses or traffic warrants, failing to pay fines and contempt, pre-\nadjudication, they are eligible under the Settlement Agreement if they were strip \nsearched.  Consequently, if you failed to honor a payment order with a municipal court \nand were arrested, or failed to appear for a municipal court date and arrested, brought to \nthe Salem County Correctional Facility and strip searched, you are eligible to receive a \nsettlement payment.  \nIX.      I WAS ADMITTED TO THE SALEM COUNTY CORRECTIONAL \nFACILITY BUT I CANโT REMEMBER WHAT MY CRIMINAL \nCHARGES WERE.  HOW CAN I FIND THIS OUT, AND HOW DO I \nKNOW IF THE CHARGE WAS A MISDEMEANOR OR VIOLATION? \n  There are several ways for potential class members to determine the nature of \ntheir criminal charges.  First, you can review your charging documents, which should \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-5   Filed 12/30/08   Page 6 of 11 PageID: 261\nreflect both your actual charges and whether the charges were a non-indictable offense.  \nIf you do not have your charging document and remember the local court where you were \nprosecuted, the court clerk will be able to help you find these documents.   \n \n  If you need additional help determining whether you are a class member, or of \nyou have other questions, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at [insert \nnumber].   \n  You can still make a claim if you do not remember your criminal charges if you \nbelieve you are a member of the Class, but you may be asked for additional information.   \n \nX.        I PLED GUILTY TO AN OFFENSE.  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT MY \nRIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \n  If you were admitted to the Salem County Correctional Facility solely on non-\nindictable or other minor charges, as defined above, you can participate in the settlement \nregardless of how you resolved your charges, including if you pled guilty to those \ncharges.  This is provided that you were admitted to the Correctional Facility before \nbeing sentenced by a court.  For most Class Members, this would mean that they were \ncommitted to the Salem County Correctional Facility after they were arraigned before a \nJudge.  If you were sentenced before admission to the Correctional Facility (meaning you \nwere committed after pleading guilty or being convicted at trial) you are not a Class \nMember.   \nXI.    WHAT IF I WAS ADMITTED TO THE SALEM COUNTY \nCORRECTIONAL FACILITY ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION \nDURING THE CLASS PERIOD?  CAN I STILL PARTICIPATE IN THE \nSETTLEMENT? \n  Yes.  Individuals who were admitted to the Salem County Correctional Facility on \nmore than one occasion during the class period can be members of the class and can \nrecover money.  They can only recover one payment, however, meaning that you will not \nbe provided with extra payments if you were admitted to the Salem County Correctional \nFacility more than one time.   \nXII.    I AM STILL NOT SURE IF I AM INCLUDED. \n  If you are still not sure if you are included, you can ask for help.  You can call \n[insert number] and the Settlement Administrator or Class Counsel may help answer \nyour questions.  For more information, you can also visit the website, [INSERT], or you \ncan just fill out the Claim Form and return it to the Settlement Administrator to see if you \nqualify. \n \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-5   Filed 12/30/08   Page 7 of 11 PageID: 262\nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS - WHAT YOU GET\n \nXIII.   WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE? \n  Defendants have agreed to pay $640,000 (six hundred and forty thousand dollars) \nto resolve this litigation.  That money will be used to: 1) compensate Class Members who \nhave been illegally strip searched; 2) pay for notifying Class Members and administering \nthe settlement; 3) pay incentive awards to the named Plaintiff, Dana Clark; and 4) pay \nattorneysโ fees and expenses.  A complete description of the settlement is provided in the \nSettlement Agreement.  You can get a copy of the Settlement Agreement by visiting \n[enter website address] or by calling [enter administrator phone number].   \nXIV.   WHAT CAN I GET FROM THE SETTLEMENT? \n  The settlement provides that all Class Members who make claims will receive an \nequal pro-rata share of $640,000, minus the costs of notice and administration, an \nincentive award for the named Plaintiff, attorneysโ fees, and expenses.  Class Counsel \nanticipates, based on claims rates from other settlements, that all individuals who make a \nclaim on the settlement will receive between $350.00 and no more than $950.00 as a \nsettlement payment.  These amounts are dependent on how many claims are received by \nthe Claims Administrator during the claims period, and are subject to change based the \nnumber of claims received.  No amount is guaranteed. \n  In the event that the pro rata share of the settlement payouts would exceed \n$950.00 per person, then Defendants will receive the remaining funds. \nHOW YOU GET A PAYMENT - SUBMITTING A CLAIM FORM \n \nXV.    HOW CAN I GET A PAYMENT? \n  To qualify for a payment, you MUST send in a Claim Form.  A claim form is \nattached to this Notice.  You can also get a claim form on the Internet at [INSERT].  \nRead the instructions carefully, fill out the form, sign it, and mail it postmarked no later \nthan [insert date].   It is recommended that you send your Claim Form in by certified \nmail, return receipt requested or some form of overnight delivery that provides a record \nof delivery. \n  You may be asked for additional documents, and will be contacted in writing.  \nYou may want to send in your claim form by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, \nto ensure that it is received by the Settlement Administrator.   \n \nXVI.   WHEN WOULD I GET MY PAYMENT? \n  The Court will hold a hearing on [insert date] to decide whether to approve the \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-5   Filed 12/30/08   Page 8 of 11 PageID: 263\nsettlement.  If Judge Bumb approves the settlement, there may be appeals.  It is always \nuncertain whether those appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, \nperhaps more than a year.  Everyone who sends in a claim form will be informed of the \nprogress of the settlement.  Please be patient.   \nXVII.   WHAT AM I GIVING UP TO GET A PAYMENT OR STAY IN THE \nCLASS? \n  Unless you exclude yourself, you are staying in the Class, and that means you \ncanโt sue, continue to sue, or be part of any other lawsuit against Salem County, its \nemployees, or its elected officials about the legal issues in this case.  It also means that all \nthe Courtโs orders will apply to you and legally bind you.  If you sign the claim form, you \nwill agree to release all claims that you have relating to having been strip searched.   \nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT\n \n \n  If you do not want a payment from this settlement, but you want to keep the right \nto sue or continue to sue Salem County on your own about the legal issues in this case, \nthen you must take steps to preserve these rights.  This is called excluding yourself - or is \nsometimes referred to as โopting outโ of the Settlement Class.   \nXVIII.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBJECTING AND \nEXCLUDING MYSELF? \n  Objecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like something about the \nsettlement.  You can object only if you stay in the Class.  Excluding yourself is telling the \nCourt that you do not want to be a part of the class.

This action was commenced on May 14, 2007, as a class action. \n2.  Following  upon  commencement  of  the  action,  and  in  connection  with  initial \ndisclosures and communications between counsel, the parties decided to determine if a \nsettlement could be obtained to avoid the costs of litigating case and they entered into \nmediation before former Magistrate Judge Joel Rosen. \n3.  As a result of those settlement conferences, the parties have reached accord with \nrespect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class Members, in \nreturn for a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in this case against the Defendants \n(โSettlement  Agreementโ).    The  resulting  Settlement  Agreement  was  preliminarily \napproved by the Court on _______________, 2009. \n3.  As  part  of  the  Order  Granting  Preliminary  Approval,  this  Court  approved  a \nproposed  Notice  Plan  and  Class  Notice,  which  provided  Settlement  Class  Members \nnotice of the proposed settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an opportunity for Class \nMembers  to  file  objections  to  the  Settlement,  and  an  opportunity  to  opt-out  of  the \nSettlement. \n4.  As of the deadline for the filing of objections, ____________objections or opt-\nouts were filed.  Given the size of this Settlement, and the Notice Plan described above, \nthis Court finds that the number or lack of objections and opt-outs is indicative of the \nfairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement with the Defendants. \n5.  The settling parties have filed with the Court an affidavit from The Garden City \nGroup declaring that the mailing of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice \n  2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-6   Filed 12/30/08   Page 3 of 7 PageID: 269\nPlan, has been completed. \n6.  The Court finds that the published notice, mailed notice and Internet posting \nconstitute the best practicable notice of the Fairness Hearing, proposed Settlement, Class \nCounselโs application for fees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class \nNotice and Short Form Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient \nnotice to all members of the Settlement Class, and complied fully with the requirements \nof Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, \nthe laws of New Jersey and any other applicable law. \n7.  Any  persons  who  wished  to  be  excluded  from  this  action  were  provided  an \nopportunity to โopt-outโ pursuant to the Notice.  [________ individuals, whose names \nand addresses are set forth on Attachment A opted out of the Settlement] \n8.  Settlement Class Members are bound by: the Settlement, Settlement Agreement, \nthe terms of the releases contained within the Settlement Agreement, and the Final Order \nand Judgment.  Settlement Class Members do not have a further opportunity to opt-out of \nthis Action. \n9.  Any Class Member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to \nthe Settlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiffโs \nClass  Counselโs  application  for  fees,  costs,  and  expenses,  in  accordance  with  the \nprocedure set forth in the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary \nApproval  of  Settlement,  is  deemed  to  have  waived  any  such  objection  by  appeal, \ncollateral attack, or otherwise. \n10.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable \n  3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-6   Filed 12/30/08   Page 4 of 7 PageID: 270\nand adequate compromise of the claims against the Defendants in this case, pursuant to \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the \nCourt has considered in affirming this Settlement, including: \n  a.    The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \n  b.    This Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class Members now, \nwithout  further  litigation,  under  circumstances  where  the  liability  issues  are  still \nvigorously contested among the parties to this litigation and among the parties to the \nindividual  litigation.  This  Settlement  provides  Class  Members  with  a  substantial \nmonetary benefit.  \n  c.    This  Settlement  is  a  byproduct  of  hard-fought  litigation  between  the \nparties, and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or Counsel for the \nDefendants. \n  d.  Class Counsel, attorneys with significant experience in litigating these \ncases believes that in light of all the facts and circumstances the Settlement is fair, \nadequate and reasonable for the Class as a whole. \n11.  Class  Counsel  submitted  to  the  Court  and  served  on  the  Defendants  their \napplication for reasonable attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses consistent with the terms \nof the Settlement Agreement.  This Court has considered Class Counselโs request and \nhereby grants the request. \n12.  The  claims  procedure  established  under  the  Settlement  Agreement  is  fair,  a \nsimplified process, and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work \nout any unanticipated problems. \n  4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-6   Filed 12/30/08   Page 5 of 7 PageID: 271\n  NOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS \nOF  FACT  AND  THE  COURT  HEREBY  MAKES  THE  FOLLOWING \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW: \n \n13.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  and  the  subject  matter  of  this \nproceeding. \n14.  Pursuant  to  Rule  23  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  the  following \nSettlement Class is certified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the Salem \nCounty Correctional Facility after being charged and arrested within the \nCounty of Salem for misdemeanors, violations, traffic infractions, failing \nto  make  payment  on  outstanding  traffic  violations,  failing  to  make \npayment on outstanding fines or other minor offenses or violations and \nwere strip searched absent any particularized suspicion that they possessed \nweapons or other contraband. The class period commences on May 14, \n2005 and extends until December 30, 2008. Specifically excluded from the \nclass are Defendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n15.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule \n23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a class action is an \nappropriate method for resolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for \nclass certification under Rule 23 are present.  The Class Members are ascertainable and \ntoo numerous to be joined.  Questions of law and fact common to all Class members \npredominate over individual issues and should be determined in one proceeding with \nrespect to all Class members.  The Class Representativeโs claims are typical of those of \nthe Class.  The Class action mechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating \nand resolving this action. \n16.  The Settlement Class Representative, Dana B. Clark, is entitled to and is hereby \nawarded a payment of $2,500, in recognition of the efforts she undertook in connection \nwith this lawsuit. All Class Members who have made claims on the settlement are \n  5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-6   Filed 12/30/08   Page 6 of 7 PageID: 272\nentitled  to  receive  their  pro  rata  share  of  the  settlement  fund  after  administrative \nexpenses, attorneysโ fees and expenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the fund, \nin an amount not to exceed $950.00.  \n17.

LaDuca, Esquire, of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, \nWashington, DC; Elmer Robert Keach, III, of the Law Offices of Elmer Robert Keach, \nIII, Amsterdam, New York; and William A. Riback of William Riback, LLC, are hereby \nappointed as Counsel for the Settlement Class pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(a)(4) and (g). \n18.  The  Court  grants  final  approval  of  the  Settlement  Agreement,  as  being  fair, \nreasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nand that distribution should proceed pursuant to the final form of the Plan of Distribution \nthat has been submitted to the Court. \n19.  The Court finds that the request for attorneysโ fees in the amount of $________  \nand reimbursement of costs of $________, made pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(h) and 54(d)(2), is reasonable and is granted. \n    NOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS \nOF  FACT  AND  CONCLUSIONS  OF  LAW,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED, \nADJUDGED AND DECREED AS FOLLOWS: \n \n1.

If you meet the criteria \nexplained below, you can share in this settlement.  \n \n  The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey authorized this notice.  \nThe Court will have a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement, so that the benefits \nmay be paid.   \n \nWhoโs Included?\n \n \n  You are a Class Member and could get benefits if (1) you were admitted into the Jail \nfrom May 14, 2005 through December 30, 2008, (2) you were charged solely with a non-\nindictable offense, disorderly persons offense, traffic violation, violation of probation or parole, \nor held on a civil matter, and (3) you were strip searched upon entry into the Correctional \nFacility without reasonable cause to believe that you were concealing a weapon or other \ncontraband.   \n \nWhatโs This About?\n \n \n  The lawsuit claims that Defendant Salem County and its Corrections Officers booking \nprocedures constitute an unlawfully strip search of individuals admitted into the Jail without \nreasonable suspicion to believe the individuals were concealing contraband.  The County of \nSalem has denied those claims.  The Court did not decide which side was right, but both sides \nagreed to the settlement to ensure a resolution and to provide benefits to the people who were \naffected.  \n \nWhat Does the Settlement Provide?\n \n \nDefendants agreed to pay a total of $640,000.00 to settle the case.  That will pay for the \nclaims of the Class Members, the administrative costs of the settlement, an incentive award to \nthe named plaintiff, and the attorneysโ fees and expenses.  There are believed to be in excess of \n3,500 Class Members.   You can only make one claim, even if you were strip searched more than \nonce.   \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 42-8   Filed 12/30/08   Page 2 of 2 PageID: 283\n \nEach Class Member who makes a claim will receive an equal share of the portion of the \nsettlement fund allocated to pay claims to Class Members, which, after deducting the other costs \nset forth above, is estimated to be between $350 and $950.00. The maximum payment to each \nClass Member will be $950.00. \n \nIf any money is left over after each claimant has received their share of the settlement \nfund, the Defendants may receive some money back from the settlement fund.   \n \nHow Do You Ask For A Payment? \n \n \nA detailed Notice and Claim Form package contains everything you need.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. ยงยง1331, 1341 and 1343 because it'was filed to obtained compensatory damages, \npunitive damages and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the \nrights of citizens of the United States secured by the United States Constitution and by \nfederal law pursuant to 42 U.S.c. ยงยง 1981 and 1983. This Court also has jurisdiction over \n','\",\" [I, \n3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 05/14/2007     Page 4 of 14\nthis action under the provisions of 28 U;S.C.ยง2201, as it was filed to obtain declaratory \nrelief relative to the Constitutionality ofthe policiesofa local government. \n12.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง1391(e)(2) because the events \ngiving rise to the Plaintiffs' claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this \njudicial district. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(l), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of Plaintiffs and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals wh() were arrested for hIisdeni~anors Or other petty crimes or minor \nviolations and who were unlawfully detained and strip-searched upon their entry into the \nCorrectional Department. \n14.  The Class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined of: \nAll persons who have been be placed into, custody of the Salem County \nCorrectional Department after being charged with non-indictable offenses (such \nas fourth degree offenses, traffic infractions and/or civil commitments) and were \nstrip-searched upon their transfer and entry into the Salem County Correctional \nDepartment.  \",  ,I, ~ \nThe Class period commences on or about May 14, 2005 and extends to the date on which \n,  '  :,).1' ]!'I]>;(1<.:I:tl,\", \nthe Municipal Defendant is enjoined from, or otherwise cease from, enforcing it's \nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip-searches absent \nreasonable suspicion. Specifically excluded from the Class are Defendants and any and \nall of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or \n.. '  .  lc'l'd ! l!!\\) ~ .. !,!~  \" \nassignees. \n4.\\ \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 05/14/2007     Page 5 of 14\n15.  This action may be brought ~d may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n,  16.  The members of the Class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nThere are, and have been, hundreds of people who have been arrested for misdemeanors, \nviolations, traffic infractions, failing to make payment on outstanding traffic violations, \nfailing to make payment qn outstanding ,fines or other minor crimes who were strip \nsearched under the circumstances described herein. \n17.  Joinder of all these individuals is impracticable because of the large number \nof Class members and the fact that Class members are likely dispersed over a large \ngeographical area, with some members, residing outside of Salem County and this \nJudicial District. Furthermore, many members of the Class are low-income persons, may \nnot speak English, may not know of their rights and likely would have great' difficulty in \npursuing their rights individually. \n18.  Coinmon questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class that \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  The \npredominant common questions of law and'fact include, without limitation, the common \nand predominate question of whether the Deferidants' written and/or de facto policies of \nstrip-searching individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or violations when \ntransferred to and placed into the custody of the Correctional Department violate the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such \na written and/or de facto policy existed during the Class period. \n\", \n5 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 05/14/2007     Page 6 of 14\n19.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical oft he c~aims of the members of the Class. \nPlaintiffs and all members of the Class have sustained damages arising out of \nDefendants' course of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the \nharms suffered by the Class. \n20.  The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n21.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nClass is impracticable given the large nUrlibeI'~ofClass members and the fact that they are \ndispersed over a large geographical'area:Furthermore, th~ expense and burden of \nindividual litigation would 'make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nClass to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the'federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cas~s\\\\Tould' he enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all--parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class aCtion in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \n\"I\" \nprotects the rights of each member of the l~lass: i { \n22.  The named Plaintiffs have' retained' counsel with substantial experience and \nsuccess in the prosecution of class action and' civil rights litigation.  Plaintiffs are being \nrepresented by Jonathan W. Cuneo, Charles J. LaDuca and Alexandra Warren of Cuneo \nGilbert & LaDuca, LLP; Ehrler Robert'Keach,' in,iEsquire; Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich \nof the Locks Law Firm, PLLC and William 'Riback, Esquire.  Plaintiffs' counsel have the \n6 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 05/14/2007     Page 7 of 14\nresources, expertise and experience to successfully prosecute this action against the \nDefendants.  Plaintiffs have.no conflicts between themselves and members of the Class, \n,  . :-\".':-.  :';'::. - \" \nor between counsel and members of the Class. \n23.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \n\\ \nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of detainees, even though the Defendants \nhave maintained their illegal strip-search regimen for at least the past several years. \n24.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, \nPlaintiffs seek class certification underFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip-searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor cti.mes that were transported to and placed into the custody \nof the Correctional Department.  In short, the Municipal Defendant and the Policy \nMaking Defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to all Class members. \n25.  In addition to, and in the alternative, Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule \n) \n23(b)(3) or seek partial certification under'Fed: R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the'Class Generally \n26.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials, such as the Policy Making Defendarit in this action and the employees they \nsupervise, from performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with \nmisdemeanors or other minor crimes or violations unless there is reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n27.' Salem County, the Sheriff s Department, the Correctional Department, and \n,  , \n. \n~'  ' \n7 \nยท'''1, \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 05/14/2007     Page 8 of 14\nthe Policy Making Defendants have, nonetheless, instituted a written and/or de facto \npolicy, custom or practice of strip-searching all individuals who enter the custody of the \nCorrectional Department regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the \npresence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon \nor contraband. \n28.  Further, Salem County, the Sheriffs Department, the Correctional \nDepartment, and the Policy Making Defendants have also instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of conducting visual inspection of detainees in a state of \nundress on all individuals who enter the custody of the Correctional Department, \nregardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime.  For \npurposes of this Complaint, this practice1fs1colleciively referred to as \"strip-searches.\" \n29.  Salem County,. the Sheriff s Department, the Correctional Department, and \nthe Policy Making Defendants know or should know, that they may not institute, enforce \nor permit enforcement ofa policy or practice of conducting strip-searches without \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion \n30.  The Defendants' written and/or 'de/acto policy, practice and custom \nmandating wholesale strip-searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n31.  Reasonable suspicion to' conduct a 'strip:'search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n32.  Salem County, the Sheriffs Department, the Correctional Department, and \n....โข 1\", i.,  .... \n. :'. ~ \n8 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 05/14/2007     Page 9 of 14\nPolicy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to \nrectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip-searching all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Salem County Correction Department without \n<.  \" .... \nany requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written \nand/or de facto policy made the strip-searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the \nnature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of \na particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of \nroutine strip-searches. \n33.  Pursuant tothis writteriand/ordefacto policy, each member oft he Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiffs, were the victim ยทof a routine strip-search upon their entry \ninto the Correction Department.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable \nsuspicion.  Strip-searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among other \ninnocuous offenses such as, traffic violations, outstanding traffic fines and other minor \nfines. \n34.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip-searches \n- each member of the Class, including the named Plaintiffs - has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering'andinental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \n35.  Plaintiffs' experiences are representative of the Class. \n36.  On or about March 14,2007 Mr. Graff was arrested by Pennsville Police \nDepartment for open municipal warrants and subsequently transported to the Salem \n9 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 05/14/2007     Page 10 of 14\nCounty Jail with a bail of~1,083.00.  Plaintiff~as released for time served because he is \nmedically unable to work.  On or aboutMarch-14, 2007 Plaintiff was required to disrobe \nwhile a corrections officer observed him change into ajail uniform from a stationed \nlocation. \n37. Similarly, Dana Clark, on or about Qctober 26, 2006 was arrested for failing \nto appear for court.  While menstruating, she was required to remove her clothing and her \ntampon, and was observed menstruating in the shower area for approximately 30 minutes \nby various Corrections Officers. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n, Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n(Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies \nTo Avoid Constitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law) \n38.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 37. \n39.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \n, \n,  \\ \n,  ' \nconducting strip-searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the~ndividual in question has either contraband or \n.  .  \"i~h!~ t  ,i .โข Jt. โข \nweapons. \n40.  The actions of all Defendants as detailed above, violated Plaintiffs' and the \nClass' rights under the United States Constitution.  Simply.put, it was not objectively \nreasonable for Correctional Facility personnel to strip-search Plaintiffs and the members \n10, ' \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 05/14/2007     Page 11 of 14\nof the Class based on their arrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not \nobjectively reasonable for the Policy Making Defendants to order/direct Correctional \nDepartment personnel to conductยท such searches or to have a police or practice permitting \nsuch searches. \n41.  These strip-searches were concluctedpursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of Salem County, the Sheri:ff s Department, and the Correctional Department. \nAs. such, these Defendants are directly liableยท for the damages of the Class. \n42.  Upon information and belief, Salem County, the Sheriffs Department, and \nthe Correctional Department are respon~i1:he'folestablishing the policies and procedures \nto be utilized in the operation of the' CorredionalDepartment and are responsible for the \nimplementation of the strip-search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Salem \nCounty, the Sheriffs Department, and the Correctional Department are each individually \nresponsible for the damages of the namedPlairitiffs and the members of the Class. \n43.  Salem County, the SherIff s 'i>epartrrlent, andthe Correctional Department \nknew that the above-described strip..,search pblicy was illegal, and acted willfully, \nknowingly, and with specific intent todeprive~Plaintiffs and the members of the Class of \ntheir Constitutional rights. \n44. This conduct 6n the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U .S.C. \nยง 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n45.  As a direct and proximate result oft he' unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs and the Class have been irrepar~l;ly ;i~ju~ed and seek damages, as well as the \ndeclaratory and injunctive and relief set oilt inllnediately below and in the Prayer for \nRelief. \n11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-JS     Document 1      Filed 05/14/2007     Page 12 of 14\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n46.  The actions of the Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that they \ncontinue to propagate an illegal ~trip-search policy even though they know for a fact that \ntheir actions are unconstitutional. \n47.  It is clear that the Policy MakiIlg.D.efendants have no, or little, respect for the \ncivil rights of individual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of \npunitive damages is necessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a \nmessage to them that the requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to \ngovernment officials inSalem County .. --~~:  :Lยทยท. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n48.  The Plain.tiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs individuatly hnd on behalf of a Class of others similarly \nsituated, request that this Honorable CoUrt grant them the following relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a elass action pursuant to Fed; R. Civ. P. \n23 with Plaintiffs as Class representative. \nB ..

This action was commenced on May 14,2007, as a class action. \n2.  After the almost-two years of litigation, including preliminary motion practice \nand  an  intensive,  arm's  length  negotiations  between  Class Counsel  and  Defendants, \nincluding settlement conferences before former Magistrate Judge Joel Rosen, the parties \nhave reached accord with respcct to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to \nSettlement Class Members, in return for a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in \nthis case against the Defendants (\"Settlement Agreement\").  The resulting Settlemcnt \nAgreement was preliminarily approved by the Court on March 5, 2009. \n3.  As  part  of the  Order Granting  Preliminary  Approval,  this  Court  approved  a \nPlOl\"J'cc:  ;,ulicc  Pi\"\"  and  Class  Notice,  which  provided  Settlement Class  Members \nnotice of the proposed settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an oppormnity fur Class \nMembers  to  HIe  objections  to  the  Settlement,  and  an  opportunity to  opt-out  of the \nSettlement. \n4.  As of the deadline for the filing of objections, no objections were filed.  Given the \nsize of this Settlement, and the Notice Plan described above, this Court finds that the lack \nof any  objections  is  indicative  of the  fairness,  reasonableness  and  adequacy of the \nSettlement with the Defendants. \n5.  Class Counsel has filed with the Court an affidavit from The Garden City Gro\\Ip \ndeclaring that the mailing of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan, \nhas been completed.  Additionally, Class Counsel has evidenced the establishment ofthe \nCourt-approved settlement website. \n2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 49   Filed 05/07/09   Page 3 of 7 PageID: 441\n6.  The  Court  l1nds  that  the  Noticed  Plan,  as  etTectuated,  constituted  the  best \npracticable  notice  of  the  Fairness  Hearing,  proposed  Settlement,  Class  Counsel's \napplication for fees and expenses, and other matters set forth  in the Class Notice and \nShort Fonn Notice; and that such notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all \nmembers of the Settlement Class, and complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, the laws of \nNew Jersey and any other applicable law. \n7.  Any persons  who  wished  to  be  excluded  from  this  action  were  provided  an \nopportunity  to  \"opt-out\"  pursuant  to  the  Notice.  No  individuals  opted  out  of the \nsettlement. \n8.  Scttlement Class Members are bound by the: Settlement, Settlemcnt Agreem~nt, \n,eb\",,,ยท; \n~ontaifH;(i within the Settlement Agreement, and the Final Order and JudgmCllt. \nSettlement Cla~~ Member~ do not have a further opportunity to opt-out of this Action. \n9.  Any Class Memb~r who did not timely me and serve an objection in writing to \nthe  Settlemcnt Agreement, to  the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Plaintiff's \nClass  Counsel's  application  for  fees,  costs,  and  expenses,  in  accordance  with  the \nprocedure set forth in the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting Preliminary \nApproval  of Settlement,  is  deemed  to  have  waived  any  such  objection  by  appeal, \ncollateral attack, or othetwise.  No individuals filed an objection. \n10.  On the  basis of all  of the  issues  in  this  litigation,  and  the  provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable \nand adequate compromise of the claims against the Defendants in this case, pursuant to \nRule 23 oflhe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number offa ctors which the \n3 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-02259-RMB-KMW   Document 49   Filed 05/07/09   Page 4 of 7 PageID: 442\nCourt has considered in affirming this Settlement, including: \na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nh.  This Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class Members now, \nwithout  further  litigation,  under  circumstances  where  the  liability  issues  are  stil! \nvigorously contested among the parties to  this litigation and among the parties to the \nindividual  litigation.  This  Settlement  provides  Class  Members  with  a  substantial \nmonetary benefit. \nc.  This Settlement is clearly a product of hard-fought litigation between the \nparties, and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counselor Counsel for the \nDefendants. \n11.  The  claims  procedure  established  under  the  Settlement  Agreement  is  fair,  a \nsimplified P(OC(ยท,:>. nnd worLtbk  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work \nout any unanticipated problems. \nNOW, nU:REFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS \nOF  FACT  AND  THE  COURT  HEREBY  MAKES  THE  FOLLOWING \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW: \n.12.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  and  the  subject  matter  of this \nproceeding. \n13.

Specifically excluded \nfrom the class are Defendants and any and all of their respective aff1lialcs, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees, \n14,  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule \n23  of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure are satistied, and that a class action is an \nappropriate method fot resolving the disputes in this litigation,  All the prerequisites for \nclass certilication under Rule 23 are present  The Class Members are ascertainable and \ntoo numerous to be joined.  Questions of law and tact common to all Class members \npredominate over individual  issues and should be dctem1ined in  one proceeding with \nrespect to all Class members_  The Cla~s Representative's claims are typical of those of \nthe Class,  The Class action m~chanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating \nand reilol\\\"ing t.his act.ion. \n15.  The  Settlemclll Class R~pr!ls~ntative, Dana Clark,  is entitled  to  and  is  hereby \nawarded a payment of $2,500, in recognition of the C[forts she undertook in connection \nwith  this  lawsuit.

This COllrt has considered Class Counsel's request \nand hereby gmnts the request.  The Court finds that tinal approval of attorneys' fees in \nthe amount of $192,000 is warranted.  The Court finds that this amount is justified by the \nwork performed, skill, risks taken and the results achieved by Class Counsel.  The Court \nalso finds that approval of the $6,070.36 attorneys' costs application is warranted, based \non Plaintiffs counsel's out-of-pocket expenses as demonstrated by the Certification of \nSeth R.  Lesser and that approval of payment of such other incidental expenses, not to \nexceed $300, as may have been incurred or will be incurred in connection with the Fina) \nApproval Hearing and the tinalization of the Settlement is also warranted. \n17.  The Court finds that the payment of the incurred and anticipated expenses of the \nClaims Administrutor, the Garden City Group, as set forth in the Certification of Seth R. \nLesser is reasonable and justified. \n18.  The  COUlt grants  final  approval  of the  Settlement Agreement,  as  being  fair, \nreasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOIN(; FINDINGS \nOF  .FACT  AND  CONCLUSIONS  OF  LAW,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED, \nAD,JUDGED AND DECREED AS FOLLOWS: \n1.
