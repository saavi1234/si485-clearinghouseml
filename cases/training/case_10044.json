    "summary": "<p>On October 6, 2003, three days before his scheduled execution by lethal injection, an inmate at the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Alabama Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.  The plaintiff alleged that his constitutional rights were threatened by the defendant's use of the \"cut-down\" procedure, which required an incision into his arm or leg to assess his veins (which had been severely compromised due to years of intravenous drug use) in anticipation of the lethal injection.  The plaintiff argued that the use of the procedure constituted deliberate indifference to his medical needs because it would \"create risks of complications, be inhumane, conflict with evolving standards of decency, and entail unnecessary mental and physical pain and suffering.\"  He sought a permanent injunction against the procedure, as well as a temporary stay of his execution so that the court could consider the merits of his petition for the injunction.</p><p>On October 7, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama (Judge Myron H. Thompson) granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the claim, holding that the Section 1983 claim was functionally equivalent to the plaintiff's earlier habeas corpus claim, which had been denied by the court.  Nelson v. Campbell, 286 F.Supp.2d 1321 (M.D.Ala. 2003).  The plaintiff appealed.</p><p>On October 8, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (Judge Robert Lanier Anderson III) affirmed the District Court's decision, holding that the prisoner's Section 1983 claim was the functional equivalent of the previously denied habeas corpus claim, and that the prisoner had not been denied access to his physician in violation of Alabama law.  Nelson v. Campbell, 347 F.3d 910 (11th Cir. 2003).  On October 9, 2003, the plaintiff's request for a rehearing en banc was denied.  Nelson v. Campbell, No. 03-15095, 85 Fed.Appx. 728 (11th Cir. 2003).  The plaintiff sought Supreme Court review.</p><p>On October 9, 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of execution of sentence of death pending their decision on whether to grant certiorari.  Nelson v. Campbell, 540 U.S. 942 (2003).  On December 1, 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on the limited question of whether a complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by a death-sentenced prisoner, who seeks to stay his execution in order to pursue a challenge to the procedures for carrying out the execution may be properly recharacterized as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S. 2254.  Nelson v. Campbell, 540 U.S. 1046 (2003).  </p><p>On May 24, 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court (Justice O'Connor) reversed and remanded the case back to the Eleventh Circuit, holding that Section 1983 was an appropriate vehicle for a prisoner to challenge the \"cut-down\" procedure, and that the prisoner's request for temporary stay of execution did not transform his conditions of confinement claim into a challenge to the validity of his death sentence sounding in habeas corpus.  Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004).  On July 20, 2004, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case back to the District Court for proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court opinion.  Nelson v. Campbell, 377 F.3d 1162 (11th Cir. 2004).</p><p>On October 7, 2004, the District Court (Judge Thompson) entered an order that the defendants should not use the \"cut-down\" procedure on the plaintiff, but rather that they must use either a peripheral-venous-access procedure or a peripheral-central-venous-access procedure on him.  The plaintiff had asked for these procedures because he believed that they would be \"less invasive, less painful, faster, cheaper, and safer than the cut-down procedure,\" as well as being humane and not in violation of the plaintiff's Eighth Amendment rights.  The defendants agreed to utilize one of these methods if it became necessary to obtain a central line on the plaintiff, so the order was based on their consent.  </p><p>On October 29, 2004, the defendants asked the court for summary judgment in light of that substantial agreement.  On October 22, 2005, the plaintiff filed his second amended complaint, alleging that there were still material facts at issue in the case.  Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that if the agreed-upon central line placement procedure was not performed by a qualified physician in an appropriate medical environment, his Eighth Amendment rights would still be violated.  He asked the court to direct the defendants to consult with medical experts and promulgate a protocol concerning venous access that comports with contemporary standards of medical care and the Eighth Amendment.  On June 15, 2006, the court designated Dr. Warren Bagley, M.D. to be the court's independent medical expert, and on July 28, 2006, the court ordered Dr. Bagley to assist the court in understanding the outstanding issues of fact in the case.  </p><p>On September 26, 2006, the District Court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that there were still facts at issue in the case, and stating that the court would reconsider the motion for summary judgment after Dr. Bagley had submitted his report.  </p><p>On November 15, 2006, the defendants again asked the court for summary judgment in light of the fact that, in the opinion of Dr. Bagley, access to the plaintiff's central veins would not be necessary, since there were three locations on the plaintiff's body where peripheral veins could be easily accessed, and that a it would not be necessary to obtain a highly trained specialist to access those veins.  The defendants argued that this made the plaintiff's complaint moot, leaving no genuine issues of material fact in the case.  </p><p>On March 31, 2008, the District Court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that the United States Supreme Court's decision in Baze v. Rees could inform the decision in the case at bar.  Accordingly, the court denied the motion for summary judgment with leave to renew within 30 days of the Baze decision.</p><p>On May 15, 2008, the defendants renewed their motion for summary judgment because the United States Supreme Court had handed down its decision in Baze v. Rees.  The defendants' motion argued that the Court's decision in Baze supported their contention that the execution protocol used in Alabama was constitutional.  Specifically the Defendants argued that \"the Supreme Court's recent decision in Baze applies to Alabama's execution protocol because it is substantially similar to Kentucky's,\" which was upheld by the Court.</p><p>On July 21, 2008, the plaintiff filled his response to the defendants' renewed motion for summary judgment.  The plaintiff's main argument was that Baze did not support the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The plaintiff made clear that the Supreme Court held that \"when a condemned establishes that his execution will involve a \"substantial risk of serious harm\" or an \"objectively intolerable risk of harm...\" based on how it is to be carried out.  Accordingly, the plaintiff argued that the defendants' execution protocol was unconstitutional because it would subject him to an unconstitutional level of pain.  Specifically, the plaintiff insisted that \"the administration of the protocol to the Plaintiff will result in a substantial and objectively intolerable risk of serious harm due to the Plaintiff's medical condition and severely compromised peripheral veins.\"</p><p>On December 9, 2009, the court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment as moot.  The court recognized that the motion had become moot because of the death of the plaintiff.  Alabama news sources reported that the plaintiff died of natural causes on November 3, 2009. The case is now closed.</p>",

      "text": "Attachment A \nExpert Report of the Court's \nIndependent Medical Expert \nDr. Warren Bagley \nReport Based upon Dr. Bagley's Physical \nExamination of David Larry Nelson Conducted at \nHolman Prison on October 11, 2006 \n870138.1 \n\nThis examination took place in the infirmary area of Holman State \nPrison on Wednesday 11 October 2006 from 1420-1500 hrs. Present were the \nexaminer (Warren Bagley, MD), Attorney Chris Heinss (Balch, Bingham \nSpecial Master), Prisoner's Attorney Victoria Smith, Attorney General's \nRepresentative Clay Crenshaw, Prison Warden Grantt Culliver, Prisoner's \nExpert Witness Mark Heath, MD, and two guards. \nI examined Mr. Nelson with regards to obtaining venous access, \nvisually and with palpation, and sonographically.  The results of both exams \nare documented both in writing and with supporting photographs. \nMr. Nelson was asked to lie supine on a gurney. The first examination \nwas visual and with palpation.  A tourniquet was applied to the left upper arm, \nthe arm was extended towards the floor from the gurney, and I knelt by the \ngurney to perform the exam. The reason for this somewhat awkward position \nis that gravity assists with helping the veins stand out; blood tends to pool in \nthe lowest part of the body. \nAs can be seen from photos A and B, there are no prominent superficial \nveins on the forearm which would support an IV of sufficient size (see \nGlossary) to administer the volume of solution at the necessary rate to perform \nan anesthetic, administer fluids for resuscitation, etc.  The examination \nincluded the palmar and volar (see Glossary) aspects of the hand, wrist, and \nforearm, and the antecubital fossa (see Glossary).  The line on Photo B \nrepresents the level at which ultrasonic examination of the antecubital fossa \noccurred. \nPhoto A  Photo B \n870138.1 \n\nThe ultrasonic examination (see Glossary) of the left antecubital fossa \ndid not reveal any veins.  See Ultrasound 1. \nUltrasound 1. \nNote:  although the ultrasound exam was performed after the \nvisual/palpatory exam, I present them simultaneously for the sake of clarity. \nThe second area of examination was the left lower extremity.  A \ntourniquet was applied to the mid-calf and examination of the foot and ankle \nwas carried out, again with the extremity dangling off the gurney and the \nexaminer kneeling. \nIt should be noted that Mr. Nelson's skin on the lower extremities has \nhyperpigmented and pitting edema changes consistent with venous stasis (see \nGlossary) and congestive heart failure.  He also has a history of congestive \nheart failure, and of upper thigh varicosities (see Glossary).  Although it is \ntechnically possible to insert an IV into a varicosity, it is generally quite \npainful and not always successful, as varicosities are often tortuous. \nThe largest and most commonly cannulated (see Glossary) peripheral \nvein in the leg is the saphenous vein, which courses up the medial (inside) \nportion of the ankle and leg.  While I was not able to see this vein on the left \nankle, it was distinctly palpable and clearly visible on ultrasound.  See Photos \nC and D, and Ultrasound 2. Again, yellow line indicates level of ultrasound \nexam. The white donut-shaped device is the tourniquet. \n870138.1 \n\nPhoto C \nPhoto D \n870138.1 \n\nUI trasound 2 \nThe saphenous vein is clearly visible in cross-section as the dark round \nstructure at the end of the arrow. This vein is readily able to be cannulated by \npersons who are certified to initiate IV therapy, i.e. emergency medical \ntechnicians/paramedics who are so certified, military combat medics, nurses, \nCRNAs (certified registered nurse anesthetists), PAs (physician' s assistants) \nand physicians. \nThe next area examined was the right ankle, which followed the same \nprotocol as for the left.  See Photos E and F, and Ultrasound 3.  The \nsaphenous vein in this leg was visible, palpable, and readily visualized on \nultrasound. \n870138.1 \n\nPhoto E \nThe dark arrows point to the saphenous vein.  The yellow line is the \nlevel at which ultrasound examination occurred. \nPhoto F \n870138.1 \n\nUI trasound 3 \nThe dark arrow points to the lumen (see Glossary) of the saphenous \nvein. This vein is equally accessible as was the left, by the same level of \npersonnel. \nThe next area examined was the right arm, performed in a manner \nsimilar to the left, with the tourniquet in place and the arm extended down \ntowards the floor.  The distal forearm and hand were again devoid of visible \nor palpable veins.  The antecubital fossa contained a large vein (the basilic \nvein) which was visible, palpable, and readily visualized with ultrasound.  See \nPhoto G and Ultrasound 4. \n870138.1 \n\nPhoto G \nThe dark arrows point to the basilic vein. \nUltrasound 4 \nThe dark arrow points to the basilic vein. This vein is readily \ncannulated by anyone trained/certified to start basic intravenous lines, even \nmore easily than the saphenous veins listed above, and is one of the veins \ncommonly used when blood is drawn for laboratory tests or for blood \ndonation. \nThe next area examined was the right side of the neck, specifically the \narea known as the anterior cervical triangle (see Glossary).  In this area lie the \ninternal and external jugular veins. In the supine position Mr. Nelson's \n870138.1 \n\nexternal jugular vein was readily visible (see Photo H), and easily seen with \nultrasound (see Ultrasound 5). \nPhoto H \nOnce again, the thin dark arrow points to the external jugular vein.  The \nupper yellow line is where the ultrasound probe was placed to examine the \nexternal jugular vein, and the heavier lower yellow line indicates probe \nplacement for examination of the right internal jugular vein. The large double \nblack arrow points to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (see below). \nThis vein (the external jugular) is easy to see, and yet moderately \ndifficult to cannulate unless the operator has had some experience in \ncannulating it specifically, as it is very easy to go through the vein instead of \ninto it.  Mostly one finds MDs and military combat medics accessing this \nvein, but some EMT/paramedics may have had experience with it. Nurses \nusually do not use veins in the neck. \n870138.1 \n\nUI trasound 5 \nThe dark arrow points to the right external jugular vein. \nThe largest vein in the neck is the internal jugular.  It courses through \nthe neck deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (indicated by the large black \ndouble arrow in Photo H; see Glossary) and generally shallow and lateral to \nthe carotid artery.  See Ultrasound 6. The single arrow points to the right \ninternal jugular vein, and the double arrow to the right carotid artery. \nUltrasound 6 \nThe internal jugular vein is generally restricted to access by physicians, \nsome advanced nurse practitioners (such as CRNAs) and perhaps some PAs \n(physicians' assistants) who have had specialized training in central venous \n870138.1 \n\nline placement (see Glossary).  Once one has performed some 40-50 of these \nprocedures they become quite straightforward.  This vein is generally used \nfor major resuscitative infusions (large volume, rapid administration), for \nmonitoring of central venous pressure, or as an access for pacemaker wires or \nSwann-Ganz catheters commonly used during heart surgery. The catheters \nneeded to access this vein are of necessity longer and larger in diameter than \nmost peripheral intravenous catheters.  Because of the size of catheter usually \nplaced, a local anesthetic is commonly injected at the insertion site.  Entering \nthe central venous circulation is inherently more dangerous than peripheral \nvein cannulation, as the surrounding structures are more vital and less \naccessible if damaged (carotid artery, lungs, thoracic duct, etc). Mr. Nelson's \ninternal jugular veins are large and (with the above limitations in mind) would \nnot be terribly challenging to cannulate. \nThe last part of the exam involved the left internal and external jugular \nveins.  See Photo I, and Ultrasounds 7 and 8. \nPhoto I \nThe dark arrow points to the left external jugular vein.  The thin yellow \nline is the site of the ultrasound probe for the external jugular examination, \nand the heavier yellow line that for the internal jugular.  The same constraints \nand considerations as mentioned above apply for this side as well. \n870138.1 \n\nUI trasound 7 \nThe arrow points to the left external jugular vein. \nUI trasound 8 \nThe upper arrow points to the left internal jugular vein, and the lower \ndouble arrow to the left carotid artery. \nIt is not generally possible to image the subclavian veins with \nultrasound, and this was not attempted. \n870138.1 \n\nIn summary, Mr. Nelson has readily accessible peripheral veins in the \nfollowing regions.  They are listed in order of ease of access and therefore \npreference. \n1.  Right basilic vein in right antecubital fossa (a peripheral vein; see \nGlossary).  This vein is easily cannulated by most persons with basic \nintravenous skills (i.e. emergency medical technicians/paramedics who \nare so certified, military combat medics, nurses, CRNAs (certified \nregistered nurse anesthetists ), PAs (physician's assistants) and \nphysicians ). \n2.  Right saphenous vein at the right medial malleolus (a peripheral vein). \nThis vein is easily cannulated by most persons with basic intravenous \nskills. \n3.  Left saphenous vein at the left medial malleolus (a peripheral vein). \nThis vein is easily cannulated by most persons with basic intravenous \nskills. \n4.  Right external jugular vein, just posterior to the midpoint of the \nsternocleidomastoid muscle (a peripheral vein). Cannulating this vein is \na little harder, and requires a bit more experience. \n5.  Left external jugular vein, just posterior to the midpoint of the \nsternocleidomastoid muscle (a peripheral vein).  Same as for right \nexternal jugular. \nIn addition to the peripheral veins listed above, the internal jugular \nveins (central veins) are also accessible, but gaining such access requires an \nadvanced-level practitioner (CRNA, MD, PA). However, given the \naccessibility of the peripheral veins listed above, it is my medical opinion that \ncannulation of central veins will not be necessary to obtain venous access on \nDavid Larry Nelson. \nGLOSSARY \n(listed in order of text appearance) \nIV of sufficient size:  intravenous catheters are sized in gauges, with larger \nnumbers representing smaller diameters.  Although the Warden did not know \nthe size IV generally placed for lethal injection, I would suspect that it would \nbe 18ga (ideal in terms of ability to inject the volume required in the time \nallotted, as well as not being as uncomfortable as a larger 16 or 14ga catheter) \nor possibly a 20ga (not as much flow). Anything smaller would be essentially \nworthless. \nPalmar and Volar:  the palmar surface of the arm is that which is contiguous \nwith the palm of the hand; the volar surface represents the back of the hand. \n870138.1 \n\nMost experienced IV personnel like to use the volar surface of the hand or \nforearm. \nAntecubital Fossa:  that part of the arm at the elbow where, with the palm up, \nthe skin creases when the elbow is bent. \nUltrasonic examination:  carried out using a state of the art Sonosite \nMicroMaxx ultrasound machine equipped with a linear vascular probe.  It is \nbecoming standard of care to use this device when performing central venous \naccess, as it increases the level of safety considerably.  This device emits \nsound waves into the tissues and then constructs a cross sectional image based \nupon the sound as it is reflected back.  In the images in this document the \nsurface of the skin is at the top of each image.  On the right margin there is a \ndepth scale which allows one to know the exact depth and size of a given \nstructure. Typically, veins are seen in cross section as dark circles while the \nsurrounding tissues are lighter. \nVenous Stasis:  poor circulation of the blood as it is returned to the heart from \nthe legs.  This is usually manifested by varicose veins, which are segmental \nenlargements of the veins in the leg caused by failure of the venous valve \nsystem, due to the increase of hydrostatic (fluid) pressure in the leg when a \nperson is upright.  This fluid pressure amounts to a sizeable figure, commonly \n180 cm of water, or about one-half atmosphere pressure. This considerable \nload is dealt with via the pumping action of the leg muscles coupled with \nvalves that do not permit reverse flow. Varicosities are most commonly \nhereditary, and may cause pain and localized swelling.  In later stages of the \ndisease, fluid leaks out of the vessels and ulcers form as the skin breaks down. \nMr. Nelson has the varicose veins (varicosities) and early skin changes. \nVaricosities:  varicose veins.  See above Venous Stasis. \nCannulation:  refers to the act of inserting a plastic catheter into a vein or \nother structure.  Also commonly referred to as \"starting an IV.\"  The \ntechnique requires locating the vein, usually by placing a tourniquet on the \nextremity between the heart and the desired site of placement and locating the \nvein by visual and palpatory methods.  A catheter-over-needle device is then \ninserted into the vein through the skin; when blood returns through the needle \nthe catheter is slid into the vein over the needle. The needle is then removed, \nleaving a plastic flexible pathway into the vein (also known as percutaneous \nplacement). Neck veins (internal and external jugular) and subclavian veins do \nnot allow the use of tourniquets; the patient is usually supine, in a head-down \nposition on a stretcher to allow gravity to assist in blood pooling and dilation \nof the these veins. \n870138.1 \n\nLumen:  the space inside the vein where blood is carried. \nAnterior cervical triangle:  an area in the neck bordered by the sternal and \nclavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the upper border of \nthe clavicle.  This is readily demonstrated by turning the head to one side and \nthen attempting to tum it the other way while holding the chin and resisting \nthe movement. \nSternocleidomastoid muscle:  The prominent strap muscle of the neck which \nattaches to the mastoid process (the bump on the skull immediately behind the \near) and to both the top of the sternum (breastbone) and the clavicle \n(collarbone) approximately an inch lateral to the sternal insertion. \nCentral venous access:  in this document is the same as percutaneous \n(literally means through the skin) central venous access, and refers to the act \nof inserting a catheter-over-needle device into a central vein (see below).  This \nmay be achieved in three commonly used places:  the internal jugular vein, the \nfemoral vein, or the subclavian vein.  The subclavian route has the greatest \nassociated discomfort and risk, that being pneumothorax or puncturing of the \nlung.  The femoral route is questionably the most difficult, as it is buried deep \nin the groin and its landmarks are not as reliable.  The internal jugular is \nprobably the easiest, as it is usually not more than a centimeter or two deep, \nwith fairly reliable landmarks.  Its main complication is cannulation of the \ncarotid artery. \nA note about \"peripheral\" and \"central\" veins is in order at this point.  A \nperipheral vein is one in the extremities or neck which is separated from the \ngreat veins (inferior or superior vena cavae) leading to the heart by two or \nmore divisions. Peripheral veins are frequently visually identified or palpable. \nIn this particular instance, the external jugular would be considered a \nperipheral vein, since it is easily visualized, palpable, and empties into the \nsubclavian veins on each side, which then empty into the superior vena cava \nvia a short trunk named the brachiocephalic vein.  The vena cava leads \ndirectly to the heart. \nA central vein leads (via no more than one other named structure, usually a \nshort trunk) to the vena cava (either inferior or superior), which then empties \ndirectly into the heart (right atrium). \n870138.1 ",

CONCLUSION .................................................................. 18\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED\nThe Petitioner has raised the following two questions in his\nPetition for Writ of Certiorari before this Court:\n1. Whether an action brought by a death-sentenced\nprisoner pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which does not attack a\nconviction or sentence, is - simply because the person is under a\nsentence of death - to be treated as a habeas corpus case subject to the\nrestriction on successive petitions which categorically precludes\nreview of any constitutional violation not related to innocence (as the\nFourth, Fifth and Eleventh Circu/ts hold), or can be maintained as §\n1983 action (as the Sixth, Eighth and Ninth Circuits and several lower\ncourts hold)?\n2. Whether a cut-down procedure, which involves pain\nand mutilation, conducted prior to an execution by lethal injection,\nviolates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution?\niii\n\nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE\nEach amicus curiae is a practicing physician in the State of\nAlabama I. The amici curiae have been informed of the medical\nprocedures the Respondents have proposed using to gain venous\naccess to the Petitioner to execute him by lethal injection.\nThe proposed medical procedures concern us as physicians for\na number of reasons. First, obtaining central venous access is a\ncomplex medical procedure that involves serious risks and should only\nbe performed by properly trained personnel. In this situation the\nRespondents will not disclose the credentials of the people who will be\nperforming the procedure, including whether or not the physician is\nactually licensed to practice medicine in the State of Alabama or any\nother state. We are also concerned because it is apparent to us that the\nRespondents hope to implement a plan that was not designed by\ncompetent, credentialed physicians, and thereby are placing the\nPetitioner at high risk of enduring severe and needless pain and\nsuffering.\n1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, Rules of the Supreme Court of the United\nStates, counsel for neither party has authored this brief in whole or in\npart.\n1\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Respondents must gain venous access to the Petitioner in\norder to execute him by lethal injection. Venous access may be\nobtained in most people by placing a very thin catheter under the skin\nin the hand or arm. Gaining venous access in this manner is referred\nto as peripheral venous access and is a relatively simple procedure.\nGaining peripheral venous access may be difficult or\nessentially impossible in some patients. When dealing with these\npeople, central venous access must be obtained, which involves\nobtaining access to a central vein such as those in the chest and\nabdomen. Central venous access can only be achieved via a relatively\ncomplicated medical procedure.\nThe Respondents have essentially conceded that they will not\nbe able to gain peripheral venous access to the Petitioner in order to\nexecute him by lethal injection. As such, they will have to perform an\ninvasive medical procedure to gain central venous access to the\nPetitioner prior to his execution.\nThere are two predominant methods for obtaining central\nvenous access - - the pereutaneous technique and the cut down\n2\n\ntechnique. In the overwhelmingmajorityof situationswherecentral\nvenousaccessis required,the percutaneoustechniqueis heavily\nfavoredoverthecutdowntechnique.Thisisbecausethepercutaneous\ntechniqueis lessinvasive,lesspainful, safer,faster,easierto learn,\neasierto teach, and easier to perform.\nAttempts to gain central venous access should only be made by\nskilled, experienced physicians who have been specially trained to\nperform the requisite medical procedures. It cannot be emphasized\nenough that merely being a physician in no way qualifies a person to\nperform medical procedures to gain central venous access.\nMany serious and painful complications may arise while a\ncentral venous catheter is being placed. These complications include\nsevere pain, hemorrhage (severe bleeding), serious cardiac arrhythmias\n(abnormal beating of the heart causing shock), and pneumothorax\n(lung collapse due to collection of air between the lung and chest\nwall). Additionally, the amount of pain caused by the procedure is\nrelated to the experience of the medical practitioner performing the\nprocedure.\n\nFor some unknown reason, the Respondents intend to use the\ncut down procedure instead of the percutaneous procedure. The\nRespondents also refuse to disclose the credentials and experience of\nthe medical personnel who will be in charge of performing the cut\ndown procedure.\nBased on the scant information that the Respondents have\ndisclosed, it appears that people with sufficient medical knowledge\nhave not designed the medical procedure being prepared by the\nRespondents. Furthermore, there are no assurances that a competent,\nqualified, licensed physician will be performing the medical\nprocedures proposed by the Respondents.\nOf no small concern is the fact that the proposed medical\nprocedures described by the Respondents include references to\nanatomy not present in human beings. In addition, the Respondents\nuse the terms \"percutaneous technique\" and \"cut down technique\"\ninterchangeably when the techniques are completely distinct.\nBased upon the foregoing, the amici curiae have grave\nconcerns about the medical procedures proposed by the Respondents.\nThe amici curiae strongly recommend that the Petitioner's execution\n\nbe postponed until the Respondents disclose a medically sound,\ndetailed description of the procedure that will be undertaken as well as\na description of the experience and credentials of the medical\npersonnel who will be performing the procedure.\nARGUMENT\n_TRODUCTION\nIm\nThe Respondents have encountered a unique problem in the\nPetitioner's case involving the need for medical procedures to be\nperformed on the Petitioner in order for the Respondents to gain\nintravenous access to the Petitioner for the purpose of executing him\nby lethal injection. It the intent of the amici curiae to outline some of\nthe considerations surrounding intravenous access and also to explain\nthe bases for our concerns about the medical procedures for gaining\nintravenous access to the Petitioner which are being contemplated by\nthe Respondents.\nH. BASIC CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING\nINTRAVENOUS ACCESS\nObtaining intravenous access is a common and essential\nprocedure in the contemporary practice of medicine, because many\ndrugs are only effective if delivered directly into the venous system.\n5\n\nIn the vast majority of situations, intravenous access can be easily\nobtained by placing a very thin catheter (the same diameter or smaller\nthan the wire of a coat hanger) into a vein located just under the sk/n in\nthe hand or arm. This is called \"peripheral access\", as contrasted with\n\"central access\" which makes use of a \"central vein\" such as those in\nthe chest and abdomen. Peripheral access is usually a minor procedure\nthat causes a small amount of pain or discomfort, comparable to that\ncaused by a vaccination.\nUnfortunately, in some patients peripheral access cannot easily\nbe obtained, or is essentially impossible to obtain. One circumstance\nwhere this problem is commonly encountered is in patients who have\nreceived chemotherapy, which causes injury and scarring of peripheral\nsubcutaneous veins. As their veins deteriorate, a point is reached\nwhere the search for peripheral access becomes arduous and\nagonizing, and the patient and physician reach a joint decision to place\na central intravenous catheter. This decision is not reached lightly, as\nplacement of a chronic indwelling central catheter is a non-trivial\nsurgical procedure that involves pain and risk. Often the patient is\nreferred to a physician with expertise in obtaining vascular access; as\n\nmany physicians do not themselves have the experience and\ncredentials to place a central catheter or to treat the complications that\nare associated with the procedure. Other clinical situations that\ninvolve difficult intravenous access include obese patients (in whom\nthe subcutaneous veins are obscured by adipose tissue), patients who\nhave taken corticosteroids for diseases such as arthritis and lupus,\npatients who suffer from diabetes and regularly inject insulin, and\npatients with a history of intravenous drug abuse. Additionally, some\npatients without any apparent reason just have no readily accessible\nperipheral veins.\nCentral venous access is indicated in several other clinical\nsituations. As an example, patients undergoing major surgery often\nundergo central line placement (usually after general anesthesia has\nbeen induced) for the purposes of delivering large volumes of blood\nand fluids to treat anticipated intraoperative bleeding. Patients\nundergoing cardiac catheterizaton for diagnostic purposes may also\nrequire the placement of central venous catheters. Central access is\nalso required for the placement of implanted cardiac pacemakers. The\nabove list is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather is presented\n\nfor the purpose of conveying the scope of settings in which central\nintravenous access may be required.\nIt should be noted that in the great majority of the above-\nreferenced therapeutic situations, peripheral intravenous access is\nobtained prior to embarking on the central venous access procedure.\nThis allows the practitioner to administer painkillers and sedatives\nwhich render the central venous access procedure virtually innocuous.\nIn the rare and unfortunate situation where peripheral intravenous\naccess cannot be established before placing the central line, the\nexperience is physically grueling, painful, and arduous for the person\nundergoing the procedure.\nEli. TECHNIQUES FOR OBTAINING CENTRAL VENOUS\nACCESS\nPutting aside rarely used methods, it is fair to say that two main\ntechniques are used for obtaining central venous access. One\ntechnique, which is the most commonly used today, is called the\n\"percutaneous technique\". This involves inserting a needle through\nthe skin and into the vein, then passing a thin wire through the lumen\nof the needle, then removing the needle over the wire to leave the wire\nplaced in the vein, and then finally advancing a thin flexible catheter\n8\n\nover the wire into the vein. The wire can then be removed, leaving the\ncatheter in the vein. Usually this procedure is performed in the groin\n(femoral vein), the neck (internal or external jugular vein), or under\nthe collar bone (subclavian vein).\nThe second technique for obtaining central intravenous access\nis called the cut down technique. This involves the use of a scalpel to\nmake a series of incisions through the skin, the subcutaneous fat, and\nthe underlying muscle, to reach the relatively deeply located central\nvein. The length of these incisions is in the range of two inches and\ndepends upon a variety of factors including location of the incision,\ndegree of scarring, depth of the vessel, and the skill of the surgeon. As\nwith the percutaneous technique, this procedure is usually performed\nin the groin (femoral vein), the neck (internal or external jugular vein),\nor under the collar bone (subclavian vein). The cut down technique is\nalso used to obtain access to veins in the arm and leg, particularly in\nthe setting of shock from trauma, where bleeding has emptied the\nvascular system and percutaneous access is thereby made difficult.\nUnlike the percutaneous technique, the cut down technique requires an\narray of surgical tools including hemostats, retractors, scissors, and\n9\n\nscalpels. The proceduretypically requiresthe useof electrocautery,\nwhich is usedto stopbleedingby burningthe openendsof blood\nvessels.\nThe selection between these techniquesis a therapeutic\ndecisionthatis madebythepractitionerbasedontheconsiderationsof\ntheindividualsituation.Neverthelessw, estate with confidence that in\nthe overwhelming majority of situations where central access is\nrequired, the percutaneous technique is heavily favored over the cut\ndown procedure. The reasons for this are simple: compared with the\ncut down technique, the percutaneous technique is less invasive, less\npainful, less expensive, safer, faster, easier to learn, easier to teach,\nand easier to perform.\nIV. QUALIFICATIONS FOR OBTAINING CENTRAL\nACCESS\nObtaining central venous access, whether by the percutaneous\ntechnique or the cut down technique, is a significant medical\nprocedure that requires skill, judgment, and experience. These\nprocedures are typically taught during post-graduate medical residency\ntraining, and involve \"elbow to elbow\" supervision by an experienced\npractitioner. Some medical specialties (including surgery,\n10\n\nanesthesiology, cardiology, intensive care, and interventional\nradiology) frequently involve placement of central venous catheters.\nIn other medical specialties, it is frequently the case that a patient\nrequiring central venous access will be referred to a physician with\nexpertise and proficiency in performing the procedure.\nFor physicians to be permitted to practice in a given hospital,\nthey must apply for and receive admitting privileges. As part of this\nprocess, a physician will apply for permission to perform various\nprocedures, and hospitals have in place systems for ascertaining\nwhether such procedure privileges should be granted. Obtaining\ncentral venous access, whether by the percutaneous technique or the\ncut down technique, is a procedure that is specifically privileged by\nhospitals. This system is followed throughout the country as a means\nof ensuring that personnel possessing adequate training and experience\ncare for patients. In particular, in granting privileges for performing\ncentral venous access a hospital board would need evidence that a\nphysician performs the procedure with significant frequency and has\nappropriate credentials. Among the required credentials would be\nevidence of active state licensure. A hospital would also need to\n11\n\nreview a physician's career record to ensure that there was no history\nof lieensure revocation for misconduct or incompetence. It is very\nimportant to understand that merely being a physician in no way\nprovides an assurance that proficiency or even familiarity with\nintravenous access exists.\nV. COMPLICATIONS OF PLACING CENTRAL VENOUS\nCATHETERS\nOne of the reasons for requiring credentialing for obtaining\ncentral venous access is that the procedures are associated with\nsignificant complications. These complications include pain,\nhemorrhage (severe bleeding), cardiac arrhythmias, and pneumothorax\n(accumulation of air in the space between the lung and inner chest\nwall, causing lung collapse and suffocation). The amount of pain\ncaused by the procedure is related to the experience of the practitioner.\nA skilled practitioner will spend less time \"fishing around\" to find the\nlocation of the vein and will be more adept at effectively infiltrating\nlocal anesthesia to make the procedure more comfortable,\nHemorrhage can occur because of lacerating or rupturing the\nlarge blood vessels that are the targets of the procedure. Hemorrhage\ncan be external or internal. If it is external, one result can be\n12\n\nwidespreaddistribution of blood throughout the operative field,\nincluding the drapes covering the patient's face, the floor, the medical\npersonnel, and the operating table. If the hemorrhage is internal,\nexpertise and experience is often required to recognize the problem\nand provide appropriate treatment. Hemorrhage, while not painful per\nse, is extraordinarily distressing and is associated with nausea,\nshortness of breath, a sense of suffocation, and terror.\nCardiac arrhythmias (abnormal beating of the heart) can be\ntriggered by inadvertent stimulation of the heart muscle by the catheter\nor wire. These arrhythmias can cause a profound lowering of blood\npressure, which like hemorrhage is extremely distressing. If that were\nto occur, the patient would likely require electrical defribrillation or\nelectrical cardioversion, both of which would burn the skin and\nproduce an extraordinarily agonizing experience for a conscious\npatient.\nFinally, the complication of pneumothorax can be caused by\ninadvertently puncturing the thin sac that separates the lungs from the\ninner side of the chest wall. The resulting lung collapse is painful and\nextremely distressing, causing suffocation and sometimes death. The\n13\n\ntreatmentof pneumothorax involves the insertion of one or more large\ndiameter tubes (approximately one-half inch in diameter) between the\nribs and deep into the chest to evacuate the air. This procedure is\npainful, should only be performed by experienced practitioners, and is\naccompanied by its own set of catastrophic complications.\nIt should be noted that in most clinical situations in which\ncentral venous access is being obtained, peripheral intravenous access\nhas already been established. Peripheral lines play a critical role in the\ntreatment of the above-described complications because they permit\nthe administration of painkillers and sedatives, drugs for treating\narrhythmias, and allow for the infusion of blood and other fluids to\ntreat hemorrhage. Logically, in a setting where central access is\nrequired because peripheral access could not be achieved, these\ncomplications are much more fearsome and difficult to manage.\nVL CONCERNS OF AMICI CURIAE REGARDING THE\nSTATE OF ALABAMA'S PROPOSED PROCEDURES\nTO OBTAIN CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS IN THE\nPETITIONER\nIt is our understanding that the Petitioner has a history of\ndifficult intravenous access. The affidavit of Warden Grantt Culliver\nstates that difficulty is anticipated in obtaining intravenous access and\n14\n\nthat a plan has been formulated to obtain central venous access. It is\nour further understanding that this plan involves attempting catheter\nplacement in the groin, the neck, or the ann.\nIt is our understanding that the Respondents have refused to\ndisclose the State of Alabama's protocol for lethal injection and have\ndisclosed very little information about the methods that will be\nemployed in attempts to gain venous access in the Petitioner. It is our\nfurther understanding that the Respondents have not disclosed any\ninformation about the personnel who will be placing the central\ncatheter in the Petitioner, including information about the personnel's\ncredentials and experience. Indeed, it is not even known whether the\nindividual who will be performing the medical procedure holds a\ncurrent license to practice medicine in the State of Alabama or any\nother state. Thus, there is no assurance or basis for confidence that a\nsuitably proficient practitioner will perform the medical procedure.\nThe failure on the part of the Respondents to provide this\ninformation makes it impossible to rationally ascertain whether or not\nreasonable steps have been taken to ensure that the procedure will not\nbe bungled and cause extreme suffering and distress to the Petitioner.\n15\n\nWarden Culliver in his affidavitstatesthat if the central\nintravenousaccessisobtainedviatheneck,the\"externalcarotidvein\"\nwillbe used. There isno such structureinhuman beings,and itisnot\ncredibleto the amici curiaethata trainedphysician or practitioner\nwould even mistakenlyusethisterm. Oddly, an affidavitby Dr. Marc\nSonnier alsouses the term \"externalcarotidvein\". The use of this\nterm bespeaks thepresenceof lessthan a glimmer of familiaritywith\ntheprocedure and buttressesour concern thatthe personnelrecruited\nby the Respondents forthisprocedure wiU not possess the requisite\nproficiencyand expertise.Itisdifficultto believethatany personnel\ncurrentlyemployed by theRespondents possesstherequisiteexpertise\nto perform, review,or \"signoff\"on theprocedures proposed by the\nRespondents.\nItisour understandingthatWarden Culliver'sinitiapllan was\ntoplacethecentrallinetwenty-fourhours inadvance oftheexecution.\nThis planreflectsatroublinglackofjudgment. The factthatWarden\nCullivcrretractedthisill-advisedplan,eventuallyassertingthatthe\nprocedurewould be performed one ortwo hourspriortotheexecution,\ndoes nothing tomitigatethefactthathe made theproposaland, fora\n16\n\nperiod of time, defended it. Also, it is our understanding that Warden\nCulliver initially informed the Petitioner that the procedure would\ninvolve an incision a quarter of an inch in length but later informed the\nPetitioner, as is reflected in his affidavit, that the incision would be\napproximately two inches in length. Warden Cuiliver clearly lacks the\nexperience and expertise to make decisions about the medical features\nof the procedure.\nIt is also our understanding that during early discussions about\nplans to obtain intravenous access in the Petitioner, Warden CuUiver\nused the term \"cut-down\" to refer to the percutaneous procedure. As\ndescribed above, the two procedures are very different, and in virtually\nall cases it is preferable to use the percutaneous technique. Warden\nCulliver's failure to discern the distinctions between these procedures,\nin conjunction with his apparent prominent role in designing the\nprocedure, strongly suggests that the Petitioner is at risk for being\nsubjected to a poorly designed procedure.\nIn summary, the procedures for obtaining central venous access\nare complex medical procedures that require training and skill and\nshould only be performed by experienced and credentialed personnel.\n17\n\nWarden Culliver's approach thus far has been to conceal from the\nPetiitoner the nature of the procedure to be performed and the\nqualifications of the personnel who will be performing it. Based upon\nthe scant information that has been provided by the Respondents, the\namici curiae are concerned that the Petitioner is at great risk of\nexperiencing unnecessary suffering and pain.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nIn view of the above-described problems, each amicus curiae\ncannot escape the unfortunate conclusion that the Respondents have\ntaken a haphazard and disarrayed approach to designing the procedure\nfor obtaining intravenous access in the Petitioner's case. This situation\nbrings to mind an adage of medical Iraining, \"failing to plan is\nplanning to fail\". We do not understand why it would not be in the\nbest interest of the Respondents to contract with a demonstrably\nexperienced physician to perform the procedure of obtaining central\nintravenous access on the Petitioner. We also do not understand why\nit would not be in the best interest of the Respondents to provide\ninformation about the physician's credentials so that it could be\nreasonably determined that central intravenous access would be\n18\n\nobtained in a fashion that would minimize the risk of needless cruelty,\npain, and suffering.\nIt is our understanding the need to obtain central venous access\nin the Petitioner is not emergent. The readily apparent lack of a\ncoherent program for designing and carrying out this procedure on the\nPetitioner leads us to recommend in the strongest possible terms that\nthe procedure be postponed until the elements set forth above are\nbrought into place. Specifically, we recommend that the Respondents\nbe required to disclose a reasonably detailed and medically sound\ndescription of the procedure to be undertaken and a detailed\ndescription of the personnel who will be performing the procedure,\nincluding the credentials of the medical personnel. We, of course,\nrecognize the medical personnel's desire for anonymity in the context\nof performing medical procedures related to an execution. However, it\nis not difficult to envision a solution that allows for a review of this\ninformation without revealing the identity of the specific personnel.\nFor example, a mutually agreed upon independent party could review\nthe professional credentials and licensure of the medical personnel and\nprovide an assurance to interested parties that appropriately\n19\n\ncredentialedpersonnel would be involved.\nThe amici curiae respectfully request that this Court grant the\nPetitioners Petition for Writ of Certiorari.\nRespectfully submitted,\nCounsel for Amici Curiae\nPost Office Box 661111\nBirmingham, Alabama 35266\nTelephone (205) 426-3705\nFax Number (205) 426-3750\n20\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI hereby certify that I have this date served a true and correct\ncopy of this Brief of Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioner by United\nStates Mail with proper postage affixed thereto upon the following:\nMr. Michael Billingsley\nDeputy Attorney General\nAlabama State House\n11 South Union Street\nMontgomery, Alabama 36130\nMichael Kennedy Mclntyre\n507 The Grant Building\n44 Broad Street, N.W.\nAtlanta, GA 30303\nH.

This action arises under the authority vested in the \nCourt by virtue of 42 U.S.C. §1983, 28 U.S.C. §1331, 28 U.S.C. \n§1343, 28 U.S.C. §1651, 28 U.S.C. §2201, and 28 U.S.C. §1367. \n \n1\n\nVENUE \n  2.   Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1391(b) because \none or more of the Defendants resides in the Middle District of \nAlabama. \nPARTIES \n  3.   Plaintiff  David Larry Nelson is and has been at all \ntimes pertinent to this matter a citizen of the United States of \nAmerica and a citizen of the State of  Alabama.  He has been an \ninmate  in the State of Alabama since 1978 and presently is \nincarcerated  at William C. Holman Correctional Facility in \nAtmore, Alabama.    \n  4.   Defendant Donal Campbell is and has been at all times \nrelevant  to this action the Commissioner of the Alabama \nDepartment of Corrections. \n  5.  Defendant  Warden Grantt Culliver is and has been at \nall  times relevant to this action, the Warden of William C. \nHolman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama.       \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n  6.   The Plaintiff presently is incarcerated at William C. \nHolman  Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama (hereinafter \nreferred to as “Holman”). \n  7.  The  Plaintiff is scheduled to be executed by lethal \ninjection on October 9, 2003 at Holman at 6:00 p.m.. \n  8.  The  Plaintiff was previously incarcerated at W. E. \nDonaldson  Correctional Facility in Bessemer, Alabama \n(hereinafter referred to as “Donaldson”). \n  9.  The Plaintiff was transferred to Holman upon his death \n \n2\n\nwarrant being issued by the Alabama Supreme Court. \n  10.  Pursuant  to Ala.Code 1975 §15-18-82, Defendant \nCulliver, as the Warden at Holman, shall be the executioner at \nthe  Plaintiff’s execution and Defendant Campbell (hereinafter \nreferred  to as “Defendant D.O.C.”) acting in his official \ncapacity  of the Commissioner of the Alabama Department of \nCorrections will provide the necessary “room and appliances to \ncarry out” the Plaintiff’s execution. \n  11.  The  Plaintiff has severely compromised veins and has \nencountered  problems over the last two decades with prison \nmedical personnel gaining venous access during routine physical \nexaminations. \n  12.  The  Plaintiff is unable to attach a copy of his \nmedical  records to this pleading in support of the above \nallegation,  because Defendant D.O.C. has refused to allow the \nPlaintiff  access to his own medical records.  (See, \nCorrespondence  to undersigned counsel Smith from the Alabama \nDepartment  of Corrections, attached to this pleading as \nAttachment 1).  \n  13.  On at least one occasion, prison medical personnel has \nrelinquished control of medical apparatus to the Plaintiff for \nthe Plaintiff to draw his own blood after failed attempts by the \nmedical personnel to do same.  \n  14.  Counsel for the Plaintiff contacted Defendant Culliver \nthe  day that the Plaintiff was transferred from Donaldson to \nHolman  and informed Defendant Culliver of the Plaintiff’s \nphysical problems regarding his veins and of concerns regarding \n \n3\n\nthe protocol for gaining venous access for the lethal injection \nprocedure. \n  15.  At that time, counsel for the Plaintiff requested that \neither  a private practice physician hired by the Plaintiff be \nallowed  to examine and consult with the Plaintiff regarding \nvenous  access for the lethal injection procedure or that a \nprison  physician examine and consult with the Plaintiff \nregarding same. \n  16.  Defendant  Culliver assured counsel for the Plaintiff \nthat  he would arrange for a physician to examine and consult \nwith  the Plaintiff regarding this issue soon after the \nPlaintiff’s  arrival at Holman.  (See Correspondence from \nundersigned  counsel Smith to Warden  Culliver  confirming their \ntelephone conversation, attached to this pleading as Attachment \n2). \n  17.  As  of the filing date of this pleading, Defendant \nCulliver has failed to have a physician so examine and consult \nwith the Plaintiff. \n  18.  Defendant Culliver has refused repeated requests that \na private physician hired by the Plaintiff be allowed to examine \nand consult with the Plaintiff. \n  19.  Said  refusal is a clear violation of Ala.Code 1975 \n§15-18-81,  which provides in relevant part, “…all persons \noutside the said prison shall be denied access to him, except \nhis physician and lawyer, who shall be admitted to see him when \nnecessary to his health or for the transaction of business…”.  A \ncopy of Ala.Code 1975 §15-18-81 is attached to this pleading as \n \n4\n\nAttachment 3. \n  20.  Defendant  Culliver furthermore has refused to allow \nthat  same private physician to conduct a telephone conference \nwith  the medical personnel Defendant Culliver intends to have \nperform  the venous access procedure immediately prior to the \nPlaintiff’s  execution or with any  other  prison medical \npersonnel. \n  21.  During  the telephone conversation referenced in \nParagraph  14 above, counsel for the Plaintiff requested from \nDefendant Culliver a copy of the State of Alabama’s protocol for \nthe lethal injection procedure. \n  22.  Defendant Culliver refused to provide counsel for the \nPlaintiff with same.  (See Attachment 2). \n  23.  Furthermore, Defendant Culliver refused to provide any \nmeaningful  information concerning the proto col  for the lethal \ninjection procedure or for the medical procedure that would have \nto  be implemented to gain venous access to the Plaintiff \nimmediately  preceding the execution despite counsel’s \nrepresentation  to Defendant Culliver that the Plaintiff had a \nvalid basis for his concerns.  (See Attachment 2). \n  24.  It should be noted that counsel for the Plaintiff also \ncontacted  Defendant D. O. C. by telephone and then by faxed \ncorrespondence to request a copy of Alabama’s protocol for the \nlethal injection procedure and the medical procedure that would \nhave to be implemented to gain venous access to the Plaintiff as \na prior to the execution.  (See Attachment 4). \n  25.  Defendant  D. O. C. denied the request by email \n \n5\n\nmessage.  (See Attachment 5). \n  26.  Defendant  Culliver and a prison nurse employed at \nHolman  have met with the Plaintiff on two separate occasions \nsince  the Plaintiff’s arrival at Holman and have described to \nthe  Plaintiff the procedure Defendant Culliver intends to \nimplement in order to gain venous access prior to the execution. \n  27.  Ironically,  this nurse is the same medical personnel \nreferred to in Paragraph 13 above who had to relinquish medical \napparatus  to the Plaintiff for the Plaintiff to draw his own \nblood during a routine physical examination.   \n  28.  Notably,  Defendant Culliver during the first meeting \nacknowledged  to the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff does exhibit \ncompromised veins. \n  29.  Of paramount importance for purposes of this pleading, \nduring that first meeting, Defendant Culliver also informed the \nPlaintiff that a medical procedure will have to be performed on \nthe  Plaintiff prior to the Plaintiff’s execution in order for \nDefendant Culliver to gain venous access. \n  30.  Defendant Culliver furthermore acknowledged to counsel \nfor  the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff’s execution will be the \nfirst  instance of the State of Alabama having to perform a \nmedical procedure prior to the execution to gain venous access.  \n  31.  Based  upon conversations in which counsel for the \nPlaintiff has engaged with Defendant Culliver and with Defendant \nD.  O. C., counsel for the Plaintiff  in  good faith submits to \nthis Court that the State of Alabama does not have as part of \nits  lethal  injection  protocol writte n  medical  procedures  that \n \n6\n\ncomport  with contemporary medical standards for gaining venous \naccess in condemned inmates such as the Plaintiff prior to an \nexecution. \n  32.  Furthermore,  counsel for the Plaintiff in good faith \nsubmits to this Court that Defendant Culliver and Defendant D. \nO.  C. are designing a medical procedure to be followed as a \npredicate  to the Plaintiff’s execution without being qualified \nto so design such medical procedure. \n  33.  Furthermore,  counsel for the Plaintiff in good faith \nsubmits to this Court that the State of Alabama is overstepping \nits  authority in attempting to perform medical procedures \noutside  of a medical setting without appropriate medical \nsafeguards  in an attempt to carry out the legal procedure of \nexecution. \n  34.  Assuming  arguendo  that this Court finds that it is \nappropriate  for Defendant Culliver and Defendant D. O. C. to \ndesign and implement a medical procedure to be performed outside \nof a suitably equipped medical facility as a predicate to the \nlegal  procedure of execution by lethal injection, counsel for \nthe Plaintiff alerts this Court that the procedure as described \nby Defendant Culliver to the Plaintiff is exceptionally suspect \nand  carries with it a significant risk that the Eighth \nAmendment’s  prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishments \nwill be violated by its use.   \n  35.  Specifically  and as stated above, Defendant Culliver \nand  the aforementioned nurse have met with the Plaintiff \ntogether  on two separate occasions to describe the medical \n \n7\n\nprocedure that Defendant Culliver intends to implement with the \nPlaintiff to gain venous access. \n  36.  Defendant  Culliver and the nurse initially described \nthe  medical procedure as (1) involving an incision of \napproximately 0.5 inch being made in the Plaintiff’s arm through \nwhich  a catheter would be inserted  into  a vein and (2) being \nperformed  at least twenty-four hours in advance of the \nexecution. \n  37.  More  recently, however, Defendant Culliver and the \nnurse  informed the Plaintiff that (1) the incision will be \napproximately two inches in length and will be made either in \nthe Plaintiff’s leg or arm, (2) this medical procedure will not \nbe performed until approximately one hour before the execution, \nand  (3) only a local anesthetic will be used during the \nprocedure. \n  38.  Logically,  if the State of Alabama had a written \nprotocol  for the medical procedure necessary to be performed \nimmediately  prior to an execution of condemned prisoners with \nwhom peripheral intravenous access was not possible, there would \nbe no discrepancies between Defendant Culliver’s descriptions of \nthe procedure to the Plaintiff.  \n  39.  Also  troublesome is the fact that Defendant Culliver \ndescribed  the procedure to undersigned counsel on October 3, \n2003 as basically being that described in Paragraph 31 above-- \nwhich involves a two inch incision being made in the Plaintiff \nand a catheter being inserted through the incision into a vein-- \nbut  also claimed that the procedure would not be a cut-down \n \n8\n\nprocedure. \n  40.  According to Dr. Mark Heath, a licensed physician who \nis a Board Certified anesthesiologist and assistant professor at \nColumbia  University College of Physicians and Surgeons, the \nprocedure  described by Defendant Culliver is precisely a cut-\ndown  procedure.  (See Paragraph 8 of the Affidavit of Mark \nHeath, M.D., attached to this pleading as Attachment 6). \n  41.  Clearly,  Defendant Culliver does not have the \nrequisite  knowledge base to be in charge of designing, \nperforming, or overseeing this medical procedure. \n  42.  From  the descriptions of the procedure Defendant \nCulliver  has given the Plaintiff and undersigned counsel and \nbased upon a telephone conversation between undersigned counsel \nSmith and Mr. Andy Redd of the legal department of the Alabama \nDepartment  of Corrections, undersigned counsel in good faith \nbelieves that Defendant Culliver in fact does intend to perform \na  cut-down procedure on the Plaintiff to gain venous access \nprior to the Plaintiff’s execution by lethal injection. \n  43.  A cut-down procedure is an invasive and barbaric \nmedical procedure which does not comport with the contemporary \npractice of medical care.  (See Paragraphs 21, 22, 23, and 24 of \nthe Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  44.  If the State of Alabama does intend to perform a cut-\ndown procedure, this clearly would constitute cruel and unusual \npunishment  because this medical procedure is invasive, it may \ngive  rise to serious medical complications, it involves \nunnecessary  pain and suffering, it involves the mutilation of \n \n9\n\nthe Plaintiff’s body, and there are better methods available for \na qualified physician to perform on the Plaintiff to gain venous \naccess  which would comport with contemporary medical care \nstandards.   (See Paragraphs 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 of \nAffidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  45.  According  to Dr. Mark Heath, a cut-down procedure \ninvolves making a series of surgical incisions through the skin, \nthrough the underlying connective tissue, through the underlying \nlayers  of fat, through the underlying layers of muscle, until \nthe region surrounding a large vein is reached.  (See Paragraph \n9 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  46.  During a cut-down procedure, blood vessels may have to \nbe closed either by the use of cautery or the use of ligatory \nsuture.  (See Paragraph 11 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  47.  Furthermore, cut-down procedures are usually performed \nunder deep sedation that includes the administration of potent \nintravenous  analgesics (drugs that block pain) because \notherwise,  it would be an extraordinarily disturbing and \ndistressing experience.  (See Paragraph 13 of Affidavit of Mark \nHeath, M.D.). \n  48.  Of great concern is the fact that many complications \nof  the cut-down procedure are well-recognized by the medical \ncommunity.  (See Paragraph 18 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  49.  These complications include the very painful and life-\nthreatening  conditions of severe hemorrhage (with accompanying \nsense  of asphyxiation and terror), pneumothorax (with \naccompanying severe distress, sense of suffocation and potential \n \n10\n\ncardiovascular  collapse), and cardiac dysrhythmia (abnormal \nelectrical  activity of the heart leading to shock with \naccompanying severe chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and sense of \nsuffocation  or asphyxia).  (See Paragraph 18 of Affidavit of \nMark Heath, M.D.). \n  50.  Whenever  a cut-down procedure is performed in the \nelective  surgical setting, it is imperative that the medical \npersonnel  performing the procedure have immediate access to a \nvariety of drugs and medical equipment that includes but is not \nlimited  to suction, surgical lighting, surgical instruments, \ncautery,  chest tubes, EKG monitors and equipment, and a \ndefibrillator.   (See Paragraph 18 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, \nM.D.). \n  51.  The Defendants have not assured the Plaintiff that any \nof  the drugs or medical equipment described above will be \navailable during the medical procedure they intend to perform at \nHolman. \n  52.  Furthermore,  the Defendants refuse to supply the \nPlaintiff with any information concerning the personnel who will \nbe present during the medical procedure to be performed on the \nPlaintiff  prior to the legal procedure of his execution by \nlethal injection. \n  53.  As  Dr. Mark Heath explains, many, if not most, \nphysicians have never personally performed a cut-down procedure \nand  do not possess the requisite skills for competently and \nsafely  performing such a procedure.  (See Paragraph 14 of \nAffidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n \n11\n\n  54.  Hospitals  in the private sector require medical \npractitioners to be credentialed for the specific procedure of \ncut-downs for the purpose of safeguarding patients by ensuring \nthat  procedures are performed by experienced and competent \npersonnel.  (See Paragraph 15 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  55.  Subjecting  a person to a cut-down procedure in the \nhands of inexperienced personnel would represent a clear risk of \na medical misadventure and botched outcome.  (See Paragraph 16 \nof Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.).   \n  56.  Any  person undergoing a cut-down procedure should be \nentitled to review the credentials, certification, and training \nrecord  of the medical personnel who will be performing the \nprocedure.  (See Paragraph 17 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  57.  In  the absence of such a review, and particularly \ngiven  Defendant Culliver's refusal to permit such scrutiny , \nthere is a complete lack of any reasonable assurance that the \nmedical procedure Defendant Culliver intends to perform on the \nPlaintiff as a predicate to his execution will be humane. (See \nParagraph 17 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n   58.  The  cut-down procedure Defendant Culliver apparently \nintends  to perform on the Plaintiff carries with it a \nsubstantial  risk of inflicting substantial and prolonged pain.   \nSee Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 847 (1994) (punishments are \ncruel  when they entail exposure to risks that “serve[] no \n‘legitimate penological objective’”; prison official may be held \nliable under Eighth Amendment for denying humane conditions of \nconfinement  if he knows that inmates face substantial risk of \n \n12\n\nserious harm) (citations omitted).   \n  59.  The  cut-down procedure Defendant Culliver apparently \nintends  to perform on the Plaintiff does not comport with \nevolving standards of decency.  See  Gregg v. Georgia , 428 U.S. \n153, 171 (1976) and Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958). \n \n  60.  The  cut-down procedure the Defendants apparently \nintend  to perform on the Plaintiff impermissibly entails \nunnecessary mental as well as physical pain and suffering during \nthe  execution process.  See   Trop v. Dulles ,  356 U.S. 86, 111 \n(1958) (Brennan, J., concurring). \n  61.  If  the risks of inflicting pain and suffering \nassociated with execution by lethal injection in the Plaintiff’s \ncase  may be easily remedied or mitigated by employing \nalternative methods or altering the procedures employed in the \nexecution process, the Defendants’ failure to take these steps \nviolates  the Plaintiff’s rights under the United States \nConstitution. \n  62.  According to Dr. Mark Heath, there is an alternative \nprocedure  that the Defendants could utilize in gaining venous \naccess in the Plaintiff that would easily remedy or mitigate the \nrisks of unnecessary pain and suffering inherent in the cut-down \nprocedure  Defendant Culliver intends  to  utilize.  (See \nParagraphs 20, 21, 22, and 23 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n \n13\n\n  63.  This  alternative procedure is referred to by several \nterms,  including percutaneous central line placement, \npercutaneous  central access, percutaneous central venous \ncannulation, and percutaneous technique.  (See Paragraph 23 of \nAffidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  64.  This procedure has, except in rare circumstances, \nsupplanted the use of the cut-down procedure and is superior to \nthe cut-down procedure in virtually all regards.  (See Paragraph \n23 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  65.  This procedure is less invasive, less painful, faster, \ncheaper, and safer that the cut-down procedure.  (See Paragraph \n23 of Affidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n  66.  Because of this procedure's more widespread use, more \nphysicians  are proficient and competent in performing this \nprocedure as compared to the cut-down procedure. \n  67.  It would be extraordinarily rare to perform a central \nvenous  cut-down procedure without first attempting and failing \nto successfully obtain venous access using this procedure. \n  68.  The Defendants have not articulated a reason for \nimplementing  the barbaric cut-down medical procedure on the \nPlaintiff in lieu of the medical procedure available that meets \ncontemporary standards of medical care. \n   69.  Of  great significance and as referenced above, \nDefendant  Culliver will not disclose the training or \nqualifications  of the person(s) responsible for performing \neither  the medical procedure on the Plaintiff that Defendant \nCulliver  has acknowledged must be performed as a predicate to \n \n14\n\nthe  legal procedure of execution or the legal procedure of \nexecution by lethal injection. \n \n  70.  As  such, it is unknown to anyone other than the \nDefendants whether a physician with the appropriate credentials, \ntraining,  and experience will be present during the requisite \nmedical  procedure and/or the legal procedure of execution by \nlethal injection. \n  71.  The refusal of the Defendants to identify and describe \nthe medical personnel, if any, that will be present during the \nmedical  procedure performed on the Plaintiff and during the \nexecution itself raises issues of constitutional importance. \n  72.  The Defendants are deliberately preventing the public, \nthe courts, and the condemned prisoners themselves from knowing \nany  meaningful information about the lethal injection protocol \nand  any accompanying medical procedure protocol that the \nDefendants intend to use in the killing of citizens of the State \nof Alabama. \n  73.  Independent  public scrutiny undeniably plays a \nsignificant and indispensable role in the proper functioning of \ncapital punishment.  \n  74.  Public  disclosure of Alabama’s lethal injection \nprotocol  and accompanying mandated medical procedures for \ngaining  venous access are critical in allowing the public to \ndetermine  whether the punishment of execution by lethal \n \n15\n\ninjection  in the State of Alabama comports with “the evolving \nstandards  of decency which mark the progress of a maturing \nsociety”.   Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958). \n  75.  For this Court and for the public to determine whether \nlethal  injection execution in the State of Alabama is being \nhumanely  administered in cases where peripheral intravenous \naccess  is not possible, the State of Alabama must disclose \nreliable information about its lethal injection protocol and the \nmandated medical procedures that will be employed to gain venous \naccess in condemned prisoners. \n  76.  As  it stands now, this Court, the public, and the \nPlaintiff  are being forced to rely upon the very people \nresponsible  for designing and administering the protocol and \nperforming  the invasive and risky medical procedures for \nassurances that the protocol and procedures are sound and that \nthey comport with “the evolving standards of decency”.   \n  77.  In order to pass constitutional muster, an independent \nbody - - such as this Court or the public - - must be allowed to \nreview the State of Alabama’s protocol. \n  78.  It  should be stressed that there exists a humane \nmethod for gaining venous access in the Plaintiff that does not \nviolate  the Plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment rights, but Defendant \nCulliver  is adamant that he intends to implement an inhumane \nmethod  for gaining venous access in the Plaintiff that does \nviolate the Plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment rights. \n  79.  Given  the fact that  Defendant  Culliver has conceded \nthat the Plaintiff’s execution will mark the first instance of \n \n16\n\nthe State of Alabama having to first perform an invasive medical \nprocedure  on a condemned inmate to gain venous access, there \nexists a substantial risk that the Defendants intend to violate \nthe   Eighth Amendment’s prohibitions  against  inflicting cruel \nand unusual punishments with respect to the Plaintiff. \n  80.  Given the posture that the Defendants have taken \nregarding  the secrecy of the lethal injection protocol and \naccompanying  mandated medical procedures, this Court cannot be \nconfident  that the Defendants are taking all necessary and \nappropriate  steps to minimize the known significant risks of \ninflicting  severe and unnecessary pain and suffering in \nadministering  the punishment of leth al  injection execution to \nthe Plaintiff. \n  81.  Where,  as here, the Plaintiff has demonstrated the \nexistence of genuine and realistic concerns about the humaneness \nof  the execution procedure, it is respectfully submitted that \nthis  Court cannot, in good conscience, condone the risk of \nsending the Plaintiff to his state sponsored death without first \nassuring itself that the constitutional prohibitions against the \ninfliction  of “unnecessary pain in the execution of the death \nsentence”  will be honored.  Louisiana ex re. Francis v. \nResweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947). \n  82.  Failure  to provide injunctive relief will result in \nirreparable harm in that the Defendants will perform the above-\ndescribed  cut-down procedure on the Plaintiff prior to his \nexecution which is scheduled for October 9, 2003 at 6:00 p.m..    \n \n17\n\nCAUSE OF ACTION \n \nCOUNT I \n \nDeprivation of Constitutional Rights  \nUnder the Eighth Amendment  \n \n  83.  Plaintiff has the right under the Eighth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution, as applied to states through the \nFourteenth  Amendment, to be free from cruel and unusual \npunishments.   \n  84.  The  actions of the Defendants will result in the \ndeprivation  of the Plaintiff’s rights as guaranteed by the \nEighth Amendment.   \nState Law Claim \n  85.  By Defendant Culliver refusing to allow a physician to \nexamine  and consult with the Plaintiff regarding the likely \nability  of Defendant Culliver to gain venous access to the \nPlaintiff as a predicate to the Plaintiff’s execution, Defendant \nCulliver has violated Ala.Code 1975 §15-18-81. \nIn Forma Pauperis Status \n  86.  The Plaintiff has been incarcerated since 1978. \n  87.  The  Plaintiff previously has been allowed to proceed \nin forma pauperis in the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of Alabama, the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Eleventh Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. \n \n18\n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE,  the Plaintiff requests that this Court provide \nthe Plaintiff with the following relief: \n  a.  Enter  an order allowing the Plaintiff to proceed in  \nforma pauperis in this proceeding. \n  b.  Enter an order granting injunctive relief and staying \nthe  Plaintiff’s execution, which is currently scheduled for \nOctober 9, 2003 at 6:00 p.m.; \n  c.  Enter an order that directs the Defendants to provide \nthe Plaintiff with the protocol concerning the medical procedure \nwhich will be followed to gain venous access as a predicate to \nthe Plaintiff’s execution and the legal procedure of execution \nby lethal injection;   \n  d.  Enter an order that directs the Defendants to consult \nwith medical experts and promulgate a protocol concerning venous \naccess that comports with contemporary standards of medical care \nand the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution;   \n  e.  Enter  an order that directs the Defendants to allow \nthe  Plaintiff to meet with his physician pursuant to Ala.Code \n1975 §15-18-81; \n  f.  Enter an order that provides for attorney's fees and \ncosts of litigation under Title 28 of the Federal Code, and 42 \nU.S.C. 1988; and \n  g.   Such other and further relief as this Court deems just \nand appropriate. \nPART II \n  88.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference Paragraphs \n1 through 87 of his original Complaint and amends said Complaint \n \n19\n\nas set forth below. \n89.  The Defendants through their actions are treating the \nPlaintiff  with \"deliberate indifference\".  See   Estelle v. \nGamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976) and Farmer v. Brennan , 511 U.S. 825 \n(1994). \n90.  The  Defendants' \"deliberate indifference\" to the \nPlaintiff's  serious medical needs violates the Eighth \nAmendment's  prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishments \nand  creates a risk of \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of \npain\".  See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE,  the Plaintiff requests that this Court provide \nthe Plaintiff with the following relief: \n  a.  Enter  an order allowing the Plaintiff to proceed in  \nforma pauperis in this proceeding. \n  b.  Enter an order granting injunctive relief and staying \nthe  Plaintiff’s execution, which is currently scheduled for \nOctober 9, 2003 at 6:00 p.m.; \n  c.  Enter an order that directs the Defendants to provide \nthe Plaintiff with the protocol concerning the medical procedure \nwhich will be followed to gain venous access as a predicate to \nthe Plaintiff’s execution and the legal procedure of execution \nby lethal injection;   \n  d.  Enter an order that directs the Defendants to consult \n \n20\n\nwith medical experts and promulgate a protocol concerning venous \naccess that comports with contemporary standards of medical care \nand the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution;   \n  e.  Enter  an order that directs the Defendants to allow \nthe  Plaintiff to meet with his physician pursuant to Ala.Code \n1975 §15-18-81; \n  f.  Enter an order that provides for attorney's fees and \ncosts of litigation under Title 28 of the Federal Code, and 42 \nU.S.C. 1988; and \n  g.   Such other and further relief as this Court deems just \nand appropriate. \nPART III \n91.  The  Plaintiff reasserts the allegations contained in \nParagraphs 1 through 90 as though fully set out herein. \n92.  Pursuant  to Ala.Code 1975 §15-18-82, Defendant \nCulliver, as the Warden at Holman, shall be the executioner at \nthe  Plaintiff’s execution and Defendant Campbell (hereinafter \nreferred  to as “Defendant D.O.C.”) acting in his official \ncapacity  as the Commissioner of the Alabama Department of \nCorrections will provide the necessary “room and appliances to \ncarry out” the Plaintiff’s execution. \n  93.  The  Plaintiff has severely compromised veins and has \nencountered  problems over the last two decades with prison \nmedical personnel gaining venous access during routine physical \n \n21\n\nexaminations. \n  94.  Prior  to the Plaintiff’s scheduled execution date of \nOctober 9, 2003, Defendant Culliver met with the Plaintiff and \nacknowledged that the Plaintiff exhibited compromised veins. \n  95.  Defendant Culliver also informed the Plaintiff that a \nmedical  procedure would have to be performed on the Plaintiff \nprior  to the Plaintiff’s execution in order for Defendant \nCulliver to gain venous access. \n  96.  Defendant Culliver furthermore acknowledged to counsel \nfor  the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff’s execution will be the \nfirst  instance of the State of Alabama having to perform a \nmedical procedure prior to the execution to gain venous access.  \n  97.  In Nelson v. Campbell ,  541 U.S. 637 (2004), the \nSupreme  Court of the United States (hereinafter, the “Supreme \nCourt”) found that the Plaintiff’s §1983 action should proceed, \nthat  the District Court had jurisdiction over the subject \nmatter,  and that the Plaintiff had stated a claim upon which \nrelief could be granted.    \n  98.  Subsequent  to the Plaintiff’s case being remanded to \nthe  Eleventh Circuit and then to this Court, the Defendants \nagreed  not to utilize the cut-down procedure to gain venous \naccess to the Plaintiff prior to the Plaintiff’s execution.   \n  99.  The Defendants have now stated that, in lieu of a cut-\ndown  procedure, the defendants intend, should it become \n \n22\n\nnecessary,  to gain venous access to the Plaintiff utilizing a \npercutaneous central line placement procedure.   \n  100. The only information that the Defendants have provided \nthe Plaintiff concerning the percutaneous central line placement \nprocedure that the Defendants intend to utilize to gain venous \naccess to the Plaintiff is a three-sentenced paragraph from the \nDefendants’  execution protocol, which does not even refer to \npercutaneous central line placement and which states in full: \nIf  lethal injection is the means of execution, \nthe  I. V. Team will be escorted into the \nexecution chamber to start the I. V.  The heart \nmonitor leads will be applied to the condemned.   \nIf  the veins are such  that  intravenous access \ncannot  be provided, contract medical personnel \nwill perform a central line procedure to provide \nan intravenous access. \n \n  101. The  Plaintiff submits to  this  Court that the \nDefendants’  three-sentenced paragraph from their execution \nprotocol  does not describe in any meaningful manner a process \nthat  comports  with co ntemporary  medical  standards  for gai ning \nvenous access in condemned inmates such as the Plaintiff prior \nto an execution. \n  102. Counsel for the Plaintiff in good faith submits that \nthe Defendants are designing a medical procedure to be followed \nas  a predicate to the Plaintiff’s execution without being \nqualified to so design such a medical procedure. \n  103. Furthermore,  counsel for the Plaintiff in good faith \n \n23\n\nsubmits that the Defendants are overstepping their authority in \nattempting  to perform medical procedures outside of a medical \nsetting without appropriate medical safeguards in an attempt to \ncarry out the legal procedure of execution. \n  104. Assuming  arguendo  that this Court finds that it is \nappropriate for the Defendants to design and implement a medical \nprocedure to be performed outside of a suitably equipped medical \nfacility as a predicate to the Plaintiff’s execution by lethal \ninjection, counsel for the Plaintiff alerts this Court that the \nprocedure  as described in the Defendants’ three-sentenced \nprotocol is suspect and carries with it a significant risk that \nthe  Eighth Amendment’s prohibitions  against  cruel and unusual \npunishments will be violated by its use.   \n  105. The Plaintiff is in a position of having to rely upon \nthe  Defendants to promulgate and carry out a venous access \nprotocol  that comports with contemporary  standards  of medical \ncare and which does not violate the Eighth Amendment.     \n  106. Significantly, these are the same Defendants who were \nplanning  to promulgate and carry out a venous access protocol \nthat was unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court.  Nelson v. \nCampbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004). \n  107. Tellingly,  after the Plaintiff’s case was remanded \nback  to this Court, counsel for the Defendants during a \nteleconference conducted by this Court on August 6, 2004 stated: \n \n24\n\nWell,  let me tell you what we’re going to \nrepresent  to the Court now and subsequently in \nwriting,  having educated ourselves   in all these \nmatters,  that we are not going to utilize the \nchallenged procedure, the cut-down procedure. \n \n(emphasis added).  The clear implication is that the Defendants \ndid  not exert the effort to educate themselves regarding the \nsubject matter of venous access prior to the case being decided \nby the Supreme Court despite the fact that they were in charge \nof  promulgating and carrying out the protocol to gain venous \naccess to the Plaintiff.   \n  108. The  Plaintiff asserts that the conduct of the \nDefendants  from September 2003 to the present time indicates \nthat they cannot be relied upon to promulgate a venous access \nprotocol  that comports with contemporary  standards  of medical \ncare  and which does not violate the Eighth Amendment without \nthis Court’s intervention. \n  109. The percutaneous central line placement procedure is a \ncomplex  medical procedure.  In order for that procedure to \ncomport  with contemporary standards of medical care and not \nviolate  the Eighth Amendment, the Defendants’ protocol must \nprovide at a minimum the following information: \n  (a)  A  reasonably detailed description of the procedure \nwhich they intend to utilize in order to gain venous access to \nthe Plaintiff; \n  (b)  Information  as to who will perform the procedure to \n \n25\n\ngain venous access to the Plaintiff; \n  (c)  Information  concerning the qualifications of the \nindividual(s)  who will perform the procedure to gain venous \naccess to the Plaintiff;  \n  (d)  Information as to where the procedure to gain venous \naccess to the Plaintiff will be performed; and  \n  (e)  Information  concerning the availability of necessary \nand  precautionary medical apparatus at the location where the \nprocedure to gain venous access will be performed. \n    110. As was the case in October 2003, the Defendants have \nrefused to provide the Plaintiff with any of the above-described \ninformation. \n  111. If  the Defendants intend to perform a percutaneous \ncentral line placement procedure without providing the Plaintiff \nwith  the above-described information, said conduct would not \ncomport  with contemporary standards of medical care and would \nconstitute  cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth \nAmendment.    \n  112. It  is well recognized by the medical community that \ncomplications can occur when utilizing the percutaneous central \nline placement procedure.  These complications include the very \npainful  and life-threatening conditions of severe hemorrhage \n(with  accompanying sense of asphyxiation and terror), \npneumothorax  (with accompanying severe distress, sense of \n \n26\n\nsuffocation and potential cardiovascular collapse), and cardiac \ndysrhythmia  (abnormal electrical activity of the heart leading \nto shock with accompanying severe chest pain, nausea, vomiting, \nand sense of suffocation or asphyxia).   \n  113. Whenever  a percutaneous central line placement \nprocedure is performed in the elective surgical setting, it is \nimperative  that the medical personnel performing the procedure \nhave  immediate access to a variety of drugs and medical \nequipment that includes but is not limited to suction, surgical \nlighting,  surgical instruments, cautery, chest tubes, EKG \nmonitors and equipment, and a defibrillator.    \n  114. The Defendants have not assured the Plaintiff that any \nof  the drugs or medical equipment described above will be \navailable during the medical procedure they intend to perform at \nHolman. \n  115. Furthermore,  the Defendants refuse to supply the \nPlaintiff  with any meaningful information concerning the \npersonnel who will be present during the medical procedure to be \nperformed on the Plaintiff prior to the legal procedure of his \nexecution by lethal injection. \n  116. Most physicians do not possess the requisite skills to \ncompetently  and safely perform a percutaneous central line \nplacement procedure. \n  117. Subjecting  a person to a percutaneous central line \n \n27\n\nplacement  procedure in the hands of inexperienced personnel \nwould  represent a clear risk of a medical misadventure and \nbotched outcome.     \n  118. Any  person undergoing a percutaneous central line \nplacement  procedure should be entitled to review the \ncredentials,  certification, and training record of the medical \npersonnel who will be performing the procedure.   \n  119. In  the absence of such a review, and particularly \ngiven  the Defendants’ refusal to disclose any meaningful \ninformation,  there is a complete lack of any reasonable \nassurance  that the medical procedure the Defendants intend to \nperform on the Plaintiff as a predicate to his execution will be \nhumane.  \n   120. Given  the Defendants’ refusal to disclose any \nmeaningful  information and refusal to confirm adequate \nsafeguards  will be in place, the percutaneous central line \nplacement  procedure that the Defendants apparently intend to \nperform on the Plaintiff carries with it a substantial risk of \ninflicting  substantial and prolonged pain.  See   Farmer v. \nBrennan,  511 U.S. 825, 847 (1994) (punishments are cruel when \nthey  entail exposure to risks that “serve[] no ‘legitimate \npenological  objective’”; prison official may be held liable \nunder  Eighth Amendment for denying humane conditions of \nconfinement  if he knows that inmates face substantial risk of \n \n28\n\nserious harm) (citations omitted).   \n  121. Given  the Defendants’ refusal to disclose any \nmeaningful  information and refusal to confirm adequate \nsafeguards  will be in place, the percutaneous central line \nplacement  procedure that the Defendants apparently intend to \nperform  on the Plaintiff does not comport with evolving \nstandards of decency.  See  Gregg v. Georgia , 428 U.S. 153, 171 \n(1976) and Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958). \n  122. Given  the Defendants’ refusal to disclose any \nmeaningful  information and refusal to confirm adequate \nsafeguards  will be in place, the percutaneous central line \nplacement  procedure that the Defendants apparently intend to \nperform  on the Plaintiff impermissibly entails unnecessary \nmental  as well as physical pain and suffering during the \nexecution process.  See Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 111 (1958) \n(Brennan, J., concurring). \n123.  The Defendants through their actions are treating the \nPlaintiff  with \"deliberate indifference\".  See   Estelle v. \nGamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976) and Farmer v. Brennan , 511 U.S. 825 \n(1994). \n124. The  Defendants' \"deliberate indifference\" to the \nPlaintiff's  serious medical needs violates the Eighth \nAmendment's  prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishments \nand  creates a risk of \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of \n \n29\n\npain\".  See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976). \n  125. If  the risks of inflicting pain and suffering \nassociated with execution by lethal injection in the Plaintiff’s \ncase may be easily remedied or mitigated by employing adequate \nsafeguards, the Defendants’ failure to take these steps violates \nthe Plaintiff’s rights under the United States Constitution. \n  126. The  Defendants have not articulated a reason for \nrefusing to provide the Plaintiff with the information requested \nin Paragraph 109, supra.. \n   127. Significantly,  as referenced above, the Defendants \nrefuse  to disclose the training or qualifications of the \nindividuals responsible for performing the percutaneous central \nline placement procedure on the Plaintiff as a predicate to the \nPlaintiff’s execution by lethal injection. \n  128. As  such, it is unknown to anyone other than the \nDefendants whether a physician with the appropriate credentials, \ntraining,  and experience will even be present during the \npercutaneous central line placement procedure. \n  129. The refusal of the Defendants to identify and describe \nthe medical personnel, if any, that will be present during the \npercutaneous  central line placement procedure performed on the \nPlaintiff raises issues of constitutional importance. \n  130. Given  the posture that the Defendants have taken \nregarding  the secrecy concerning the utilization of the \n \n30\n\npercutaneous central line placement procedure, this Court cannot \nbe  confident that the Defendants are taking all necessary and \nappropriate  steps to minimize the known significant risks of \ninflicting severe and unnecessary pain and suffering in gaining \nvenous  access as a predicate to the Plaintiff’s execution.   \n  131. Where,  as here, the Plaintiff has demonstrated the \nexistence  of genuine and realistic concerns about the medical \ndangers  associated with the  execution  procedure, it is \nrespectfully  submitted that this Court cannot, in good \nconscience,  condone the risk of sending the Plaintiff to his \nstate  sponsored death without first assuring itself that the \nconstitutional  prohibitions against the infliction of \n“unnecessary pain in the execution of the death sentence” will \nbe honored.  Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber , 329 U.S. 459 \n(1947). \n  132. In  response to the Defendants’ assertion that they \nintend  to utilize the percutaneous central line placement \nprocedure in order to gain venous access to the Plaintiff, the \nPlaintiff believes that he is entitled at the minimum to have \nthe Defendants: \n  (a)  Provide  the Plaintiff with a detailed description of \nthe  procedure which they intend to utilize in order to gain \nvenous access to the Plaintiff; \n  (b)  Provide  information to the Plaintiff as to who will \n \n31\n\nperform the procedure to gain venous access to the Plaintiff; \n  (c)  Provide  information to the Plaintiff concerning the \nqualifications  of the individual(s) who will perform the \nprocedure to gain venous access to the Plaintiff;  \n  (d)  Provide information to the Plaintiff as to where the \nprocedure  to gain venous access to the Plaintiff will be \nperformed; and  \n  (e)  Provide  information to the Plaintiff concerning the \navailability of necessary and precautionary medical apparatus at \nthe location where the procedure to gain venous access will be \nperformed. \n  133. As was the case in October 2003, the Defendants have \nrefused to provide the Plaintiff with any of the above-described \ninformation. \n  134. In fact, the only information that the Defendants have \nprovided  the Plaintiff concerning the manner in which the \nDefendants intend to gain venous access to the Plaintiff is a \nthree-sentenced  paragraph which fails to even mention   the \nprocedure  that the Defendants intend to utilize, i.e., the \npercutaneous central line placement procedure.   \n  135. If  the percutaneous central line placement procedure \nperformed  on the Plaintiff is not performed by a qualified \nphysician  in an appropriate medical environment that has the \nnecessary  and precautionary medical apparatus, the Defendants’ \n \n32\n\n“percutaneous central line placement” procedure could, like the \n‘cut down procedure’ addressed in Nelson v. Campbell , 541 U.S. \n637  __, 124 S.Ct. 2117 (2004), be ‘gratuitous’ and ‘wholly \nunnecessary,’  Id.  at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 2123-2124, since there \nare other, safer appropriate means to gain venous access to the \nPlaintiff  and still carry out the Plaintiff’s execution by \nlethal injection.    \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE,  the Plaintiff requests that this Court provide \nthe Plaintiff with the following relief: \n  a.  Enter  an order allowing the Plaintiff to proceed in  \nforma pauperis in this proceeding. \n  b.  Enter an order granting injunctive relief and staying \nthe  Plaintiff’s execution pending resolution of the present \naction; \n  c.  Direct the Defendants to consult with medical experts \nand promulgate a protocol concerning venous access that comports \nwith  contemporary standards of medical care and the Eighth \nAmendment  to the United States Constitution and to provide a \ncopy of that protocol to the Plaintiff;     \n  d.  Enter an order that provides for attorney's fees and \ncosts of litigation under Title 28 of the Federal Code, and 42 \nU.S.C. 1988; and \n  e.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nDAVID LARRY NELSON,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n) \nv.  )  Civil Action No. \n)  2:03cvl008-T \n) \nDONEL CAMPBELL, and  ) \nGRANTT CULLIVER.  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \n) \nMOTION TO DISMISS \nCOME NOW the defendants, by and through the Attorney General for \nthe State of Alabama, and, move this Court to dismiss Nelson's complaint, \nfiled under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  More specifically, Nelson's complaint is due \nto be dismissed in accordance with Rule l2(b)(l) and l2(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P. \nIn support of this motion, the defendants submit the following: \n1.  This case is now before this Court on remand from the United \nStates Supreme Court.  Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. ---, 124 S.Ct. 2117 \n(2004). \n2.  As defendants will explain below, the claims at issue have been \nresolved and, consequently, this case has been rendered moot.  Therefore, \n\nthere are no issues over which this Court has jurisdiction and the Court must \ndismiss this matter. \n3. The crux of Nelson's case is his claim that the use of a \"cut-down\" \nprocedure to access his veins constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.  In \nhis complaint, Nelson asserted that a cut-down procedure would: create risks \nof complications; be inhumane; conflict with evolving standards of decency; \nand entail unnecessary mental and physical pain and suffering.  Complaint \nparagraphs 49,58,59,60. \nNelson also asserted that \"[a]ny person undergoing a cut-down \nprocedure should be entitled to review the credentials, certification, and \ntraining record of the medical personnel who will be performing the \nprocedure.\"  Complaint paragraph 56. \nFinally, Nelson proposed an alternative procedure in lieu of the cut \ndown procedure.  This procedure is known as a \"percutaneous central line \nplacement.\"  Complaint paragraph 63.  Nelson described the central line \nplacement as \"less invasive, less painful, faster, cheaper, and safer than the \ncut-down procedure.\"  COl1'zplaint paragraph 65.  In addition, Nelson \nsubmitted that this procedure\" is humane\", \"does not violate the Plaintiffs \nEighth Amendment rights,\" and  \"meets the contemporary standards of \nmedical care.\"  Complaint paragraphs 68,  78.  Further, \"[b]ecause of its \n\nmore widespread use, far more physicians and health care professionals are \nproficient and competent in performing the percutaneous technique.\" \nComplaint  6, (Affidavit ofM  ark Heath MD). \nAttachm~ent \n4.  Indeed, Nelson's success in overturning the original ruling of this \nCourt is directly attributable to the extremely limited nature of his claim, and \nhis repeated assertions that he was not challenging his execution per se, i.e., \nlethal injection itself, but was merely seeking to prohibit the use of a \nparticular procedure, i.e., the cut-down.  The Supreme Court made very clear \nthat this fact was essential to its decision allowing Nelson to proceed with \nhis complaint under § 1983.  The Court emphasized that Nelson \"has been \ncareful throughout these proceedings, in his complaint and at oral argument, \nto assert that the cut-down, as well as the warden's refusal to provide \nreliable information regarding the cut-down protocol, are wholly \nunnecessary to gaining venous access.\"  Nelson, 124 S.Ct. at 2124 \n(emphasis in original). \n5.  As a result of Nelson's representations - that he was challenging \nthe use of a cut-down procedure and not his execution - the defendants have \nsubmitted, and this Court has ordered, that a cut-down procedure will not be \nadministered upon Nelson.  Instead, the defendants have agreed to utilize, \nshould it become necessary, percutaneous central line placement - the very \n\nprocedure suggested and requested by the plaintiff in his complaint and in \nthe Supreme Court.  Nelson, 124 S.Ct. at 2124 (stating that \"Petitioner has \nalleged alternatives that, if they had been used would have allowed the State \nto proceed with the execution as scheduled\"). \n6.  Because the defendants have agreed not to administer the cut-down \nprocedure and to instead use the procedure requested in the complaint, \nNelson has received the relief he requested. Thus, the claims and issues \nraised by Nelson in his complaint are now moot and, as a result, this Court \nlacks subject-matter jurisdiction.  Jurisdiction may be abated if a case \nbecomes moot because there is no reasonable expectation the alleged \nviolation will recur and interim relief or events have completely eradicated \nthe effects of the alleged violation.  County of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 \nU.S. 625,631,99 S.Ct 1379,1383 (1979) (holding that the case had become \nmoot during pendancy of the litigation where there was no reasonable \nexpectation that the county would use invalidated written civil service \nexam); Scott v. Jones, 492 F.2d 130, 130-31 (5th Cir. 1974) (holding that \ntransfer of prisoner from county jail to a state prison rendered moot his \nclaims for injunctive and declaratory relief against county jail);  Troy State \nUniv. v. Dickey, 402 F.2d 515, 516 (5th Cir. 1968) (stating that the court \n\nlacks subject matter jurisdiction to \"decide arguments after events have put \nthem to rest\") (citations omitted). \n7.  The remand from the Supreme Court further indicates that there \nare no longer justiciable issues in litigation.  The Court noted that it \"need \nnot reach ... the difficult question of how to categorize method-of-execution \nclaims generally\" because \"[r]espondents at oral argument conceded that § \n1983 would be an appropriate vehicle [to challenge a cut-down procedure] \nfor an inmate who is not facing execution ....\"   Nelson, 124 S. Ct. at 2123. \n\"That venous access is a necessary prerequisite [to lethal injection] does not \nimply that a particular means of gaining such access is likewise necessary.\" \nld.  Indeed, the Court noted, \"the gravamen of petitioner's entire claim is \nthat use of the cut-down would be gratuitous.\"  Id. (emphasis in original). \n8.  As this Court will recall, it originally dismissed Nelson's \ncomplaint on the basis that it was a challenge to the method-of-execution. \nAccording to the Supreme Court, however, the question whether the cut \ndown is a \"necessary\" component of lethal injection must be answered in the \naffirmative before Nelson's complaint can be categorized as a method-of \nexecution claim.  Indeed, the case was remanded with the following \ninstructions: \"If on remand and after an evidentiary hearing the District \nCourt concludes that the use of the cut-down procedure as described in the \n\ncomplaint is necessary for administering the lethal injection, the District \nCourt will need to address the broader question, left open here, of how to \ntreat method-of-execution claims generally.\"  Id. at 2124.  The Court \nexpressly noted that \"[a]n evidentiary hearing will in all likelihood be \nunnecessary, however, as the State now seems willing to implement \npetitioner's proposed alternatives.\"  Id. \n9.  As the Supreme COUli predicted, an evidentiary hearing is not \nnecessary, as the defendant has agreed to utilize - again, only should it \nbecome necessary - Nelson's requested procedure. Now that the issue raised \nis moot, the only way Nelson can proceed is by challenging the use of the \nvery procedure he and his expert recommended.  Based on Nelson's actions \nsubsequent to the removal of a cut-down as a possibility - for example, his \nefforts to obtain all of his prison records, medical and non-medical- it \nseems clear that his intent is to proceed.  Thus, whatever it was previously, \nhis complaint - to the extent it survives at all - is now a challenge to the \nmethod-of-execution itself.  This Court does not have subject matter \njurisdiction over such a claim.  Alternatively then, should the Court decline \nto dismiss Nelson's complaint on the basis of moot ness, Nelson's complaint \nshould be dismissed because it raises an issue not cognizable in § 1983. \n\n10.  As pointed out in the State's original motion to dismiss, a claim \nchallenging the constitutionality of the manner in which his execution is to \nbe carried out is the \"functional equivalent\" of a second habeas petition and, \ntherefore, is \"subject to the law applicable to successive habeas petitions.\" \nHill v. Hopper, 112 F.3d 1088, 1089 (1Ith Cir. 1997).  Thus, this Court \n\"lack[s] jurisdiction to consider [Nelson's] request for relief because \n[Nelson] ha[s] not applied to [the Court of Appeals] for permission to file a \nsecond habeas petition.\"  Id.; see also Felker v. Turpin, 101 F.3d 95 (11 th \nCir. 1996); Williams v. Hopkins, 130 F.3d 333, 335 (8th Cir. 1997); \nMcQueen v. Patton (In re Sapp), 118 F.3d 460 (6th Cir. 1997). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court is due to dismiss the complaint \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \nRespectfully submitted, \nTroy King \nAlabama Attorney General \n/s/ J.

See \nOct. 6, 2004,  status conference transcript, at pp. 19-20.  \nAt  the  next  status  conference,  this  Court  reiterated  its \nneed  for  an  independent  court  expert.    Specifically,  the \nCourt  stated:  “I’m  ready  to  find  out  exactly  what  the \nperipheral vein access procedure is, what the percutaneous \nsubclavian line procedure is so that I can dispose of this \ncase.”  See April 12, 2005, status conference, p. 12.   \n  This Court subsequently entered an order that accepted \nthe report and recommendation of Special Master Dave Boyd \nregarding  the  physical  examination  of  Nelson  to  be \nperformed  by  Dr.  Warren  Bagley,  the  Court’s  own  chosen \n\nindependent medical expert.  See Doc. 83.  In that order, \nthe Court stated that Dr. Bagley is to “assist the Court in \nunderstanding outstanding issues of fact.”  Doc. 83 at 1.  \nThe  order  listed  the  issues  of  fact  that,  in  the  Court’s \nview,  were  outstanding.    The  order  concluded  by  stating \nthat  Dr.  Bagley  “will  do  a  physical  examination  of \nPlaintiff David Nelson and produce a written report to the \nCourt in order to assist it in understanding the questions \nand issues raised in this case as specified in this order.”  \nDoc. 83 at 5.   \n  On  October  11,  2006,  Dr.  Bagley  “examined  Mr.  Nelson \nwith regards to obtaining venous access, visually and with \npalpation,  and  sonographically.”    Doc.  110,  Ex.  1,  p.  2.  \nDr. Bagley, in compliance with this Court’s order, see Doc. \n83 at 5, has filed a written report answering the Court’s \nquestions on the relevant issues of fact.  Based upon Dr. \nBagley’s  report,  which  expressly  concludes  there  are \nseveral  locations  upon  which  peripheral  venous  access  can \nbe  achieved,  the  State  respectfully  requests  this  Court \nenter an order denying relief to Nelson.  \n  \n  2 \n\n  This  Court  previously  denied,  without  prejudice,  two \nmotions for summary judgment filed by the State.  Docs. 42, \n63,  and  102.    Now  that  the  Court’s  independent  medical \nexpert  has  filed  his  report  regarding  Nelson’s  physical \ncondition  as  it  pertains  to  the  issue  of  gaining  venous \naccess  for  the  purposes  of  carrying  out  an  execution  by \nlethal  injection,  the  State  again  respectfully  requests \nthat this Court issue an appropriate order granting summary \njudgment.   \n  In  his  report,  Dr.  Bagley  concludes  that  Nelson  “has \nreadily  accessible  peripheral  veins”  and  that  access  to \n“central  veins  will  not  be  necessary  to  obtain  venous \naccess  on  David  Larry  Nelson.”    Doc.  110,  Ex.  1,  p.  13.  \nDr. Bagley’s report lists three locations on Nelson’s body \nwhere  peripheral  veins  can  be  accessed  by  “most  persons \nwith basic intravenous skills.1”  Doc. 110, Ex. 1, p. 13.  \n(emphasis added.)  These sites include the  saphenous vein \nnear  the  left  ankle,  the  saphenous  vein  near  the  right \nankle,  and  the  basilica  vein  found  on  the  inside  part  of \n                                       \n1 Dr. Bagley also found that the left and right external jugular veins are \naccessible peripheral veins but further stated that cannulation is “difficult \n…unless the operator has had some experience in cannulating it specifically.”  \nDoc. 110, Ex. 1, p. 9.  Dr. Bagley noted that medical doctors and military \ncombat  medics  are  experienced  at  accessing  this  vein  along  with  “some \nEMT/paramedics.”  Id.   \n  3 \n\nthe right arm.2  Doc. 110, Ex. 1, p. 13.  These three sites \nprovide  sufficient  access  to  allow  the  State  to  take  the \nnecessary steps for carrying out Nelson’s sentence, without \nresort  to  any  additional  procedures.    Importantly,  Dr. \nBagley  has  determined  that  they  do  not  require  highly \ntrained specialists, as Nelson has alleged.3  Doc. 110, Ex. \n1, p. 13. \n  This  Court  has  already  enjoined  the  State  of  Alabama \nfrom using the “cut down” procedure, which formed the basis \nof  Nelson’s  original  complaint.    To  the  extent  Nelson’s \nsecond amended complaint also challenges the use of a “cut \ndown”  procedure  as  a  predicate  to  gaining  venous  access, \nthis Court’s order has mooted this issue and sufficiently \nprotected Nelson’s alleged interest.   \n  Furthermore,  based  on  Dr.  Bagley’s  findings,  the \nremainder  of  Nelson’s  second  amended  complaint  is  moot.  \nNelson’s  second  amended  complaint  challenges  the  use  of \npredicate procedures in cases where peripheral intravenous \naccess is not possible.  Doc. 60, p. 16, para. 75. (“For \n                                       \n2 It should be noted that Dr. Bagley’s report indicated he examined six places \non  Nelson’s  body  and  found  that  five  of  those  places  could  accommodate \nperipheral vein access.  Doc. 110, Ex. 1, p. 13.   \n3  Nelson’s  counsel,  without  any  supporting  documentation,  has  described \ncentral line placement as a “surgical procedure”, see Oct. 6, 2004, status \nconference at p. 14, which is a “specialty.”  Id. at p. 17.   \n  4 \n\nthis Court and for the public to determine whether lethal \ninjection  execution  in  the  State  of  Alabama  is  being \nhumanely administered in cases where peripheral intravenous \naccess is not possible, the State of Alabama must disclose \nreliable  information  about  its  lethal  injection  protocol \nand the mandated medical procedures that will be employed \nto  gain  venous  access  in  condemned  prisoners.”)  (emphasis \nadded)    Based  on  Dr.  Bagley’s  express  findings,  Nelson’s \nexecution  may  be  carried  out  through  standard  peripheral \nintravenous access, using personnel with basic intravenous \nskills.4  Notably, the fact that Dr. Bagley’s findings could \neffectively moot this case was previously foreseen by the \nCourt.  See April 12, 2005, status conference transcript at \np. 14, lines 8-11 (“…I thought that if Nelson is accessible \nthrough  the  traditional  procedure,  then  perhaps  this  case \nis moot.”)   \n                                       \n4 Nelson’s second amended complaint is replete with assertions that he does \nnot contest the ordinary peripheral intravenous access method for carrying \nout a lethal injection.  Doc. 60, pp. 16-17, 26, 32 paras. 79, 82, 111, 135. \n(“…the Plaintiff’s execution will mark the first instance of the State of \nAlabama having to first perform an invasive medical procedure on a condemned \ninmate to gain venous access…”; “Failure to provide injunctive relief will \nresult in irreparable harm in that the Defendants will perform the above-\ndescribed cut-down procedure on the Plaintiff…”; “If the Defendants intend to \nperform  a  percutaneous  central  line  placement  procedure…”;  “If  the \npercutaneous central line placement procedure performed on the Plaintiff is \nnot performed by a qualified physician…”). \n  5 \n\n  Accordingly,  there  is  nothing  in  the  second  amended \ncomplaint attacking the State of Alabama’s ability to carry \nout  Nelson’s  lethal  injection  using  one  of  the  three \naforementioned sites disclosed by Dr. Bagley. Cf. Nelson v. \nCampbell,  541  U.S.  637,  648  (2004)  (citing  18  U.S.C.  § \n3626(a)(2))  (“Preliminary  injunctive  relief  [in  prison \nconditions cases] must be narrowly drawn, extend no further \nthan necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires \npreliminary  relief,  and  be  the  least  intrusive  means \nnecessary to correct that harm.”).  The existence of these \nthree  sites  provides  the  State  primary,  secondary,  and \ntertiary  sites.    Because  Nelson’s  execution  may  proceed \nwithout  the  need  for  any  so-called  “medical  procedure,” \nthere is no basis, or cause of action, before the Court to \nprevent the State from proceeding with ordinary peripheral \nvenous access.   \n  Thus,  the  time  has  come  for  this  Court  to  end  the \npresent litigation.  The State should be allowed to carry \nout  Nelson’s  execution  using  the  three  aforementioned \nperipheral venous access sites.   \n \n  6 \n\n  It is only if  the defendants must proceed  beyond the \nsites identified by Dr. Bagley that any of the plaintiff’s \ncauses  of  action  are  even  implicated.    Plaintiff’s \nallegations regarding the qualifications and experience of \npersonnel  cannulating  percutaneous  central  line  placements \nare  simply  not  implicated  where  such  a  procedure  is  not \nneeded and, thus, not employed.  Further, based on previous \npositions adopted by Nelson during this case, he should be \njudicially  estopped  from  asserting  his  causes  of  action \nregarding percutaneous central line placements. \n  Plaintiff’s  position  before  the  Supreme  Court  was \nlimited to challenging procedures that were gratuitous and \nunnecessary to gaining venous access.  Nelson, 541 U.S. at \n645-646 (“But petitioner has been careful throughout these \nproceedings,  in  his  complaint  and  at  oral  argument,  to \n \nassert that the cut-down…are wholly unnecessary to gaining \nvenous  access.    Petitioner  has  alleged  alternatives  that, \nif  they  had  been  used,  would  have  allowed  the  State  to \nproceed with the execution as scheduled.”).  To the extent \nthat  Nelson  has  previously  defined  his  position  in  these \nproceedings  as  objecting  to  the  use  of  the  cut-down \nprocedure,  claiming  it  is  wholly  unnecessary  to  gaining \n  7 \n\nvenous  access,  he  is  now  judicially  estopped  from \ncontesting  the  use  of  peripheral  venous  access  —  areas \ndeemed  “readily  accessible”  by  this  Court’s  independent \nexpert  —  as  well  as  percutaneous  central  line  placement.  \n \nSee Palmer & Cay, Inc. v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., \n404 F.3d 1297, 1307 n.16 (11th Cir. 2005); Burnes v. Pemco \nAeroplex Inc., 291 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 2002).   \n  In an October 7, 2003, telephone conference with this \nCourt, counsel for Nelson stated “…we are truly trying to \nget an honest assessment of Mr. Nelson’s venous situation, \nand we just want to do what we can do so that the procedure \nbefore they lethally inject him so that that procedure is \nas humane as it can be under current medical procedures.”  \nOct. 7, 2003, telephone conference transcript, p. 35, lines \n13-18.    The  Court  now  has  the  “honest  assessment”  that \nNelson sought, and Dr. Bagley has found that venous access \ncan  be  achieved  through  the  use  of  the  least  invasive \nprocedure  possible,  that  being  via  peripheral  venous \naccess.  Counsel’s earlier assurances to this Court would \nbe  rendered  meaningless  if  Nelson  were  now  allowed  to \nobject  to  the  use  of  peripheral  access  to  carry  out  his \nlethal injection. \n  8 \n\n  Nelson’s conduct before the Supreme Court of the United \nStates should likewise trigger judicial estoppel.  As then \nnoted  by  counsel  for  Nelson,  “A  percutaneous  insertion \nwould  be  very  easy  to  accomplish.”    Transcript  of  Oral \nArgument, Nelson v. Campbell, No. 03-6821, March 29, 2004, \np. 17, lines 1-2.  Shortly thereafter, counsel for Nelson \n          .  \nasserted, “Mr. Nelson doesn’t even object to venous access\n   \nWhat  he  objects  to  is  some  kind  of  inhumane cutting by \n” \npeople  who  are  not  qualified  or  competent  to  do  that.  \nTranscript  of  Oral  Argument,  Nelson  v.  Campbell,  No.  03-\n6821, March 29, 2004, p. 18, lines 16-18. (emphasis added)  \nIn  his  rebuttal,  counsel  candidly  conceded:  “Well,  if—if \nthe State had then and now would concede that percutaneous \nline  placement  would  be  an  acceptable  method,  then  yes.  \n        .\nThat’s all we were seeking ”  Transcript of Oral Argument, \nNelson  v.  Campbell,  No.  03-6821,  March  29,  2004,  p.  60, \nlines  6-9.    Counsel  summarized  Nelson’s  case  by  stating, \n“Until we can go to the district court, go to a court, and \nenforce any of these representations [that a cut-down would \nnot be used and that a percutaneous line placement would be \nused],  we  are  at  risk.    And  that  is  all  we  are  asking.  \nThat’s all Mr. Nelson asked in the first instance.  And the \n  9 \n\nirony, of course, is if it had been permitted to proceed, I \nthink  we  would  have  resolved  this.    He’d  already  be \nexecuted.”    Transcript  of  Oral  Argument,  Nelson  v. \nCampbell, No. 03-6821, March 29, 2004, p. 60, lines 12-19)5   \n  Finally, but perhaps most starkly, counsel for Nelson \nhas  represented  to  this  Court  that  “there  is  no  way  this \nlawsuit  would  still  be  alive  if  it  was  reasonable  to \nbelieve  that  you  could  gain  peripheral  access  on  Mr. \nNelson.”  Oct. 6, 2004, status conference transcript, p. 7, \nlines  22-25.    Counsel  for  Nelson  has  expressly  conceded \nthat his cause of action is dependent upon the assumption \nthat “there is going to have to be central access.”  Oct. \n6, 2004, status conference transcript, p. 8.  Now that this \nassumption has been totally  undermined by  the Court’s own \nindependent expert, Nelson’s counsel’s concession calls for \n. \nan end to this case.  Cf County of Los Angeles v. Davis, \n440 U.S. 625, 631, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 1383 (1979) (holding that \nthe case had become moot during pendancy of the litigation \nwhere there was no reasonable expectation  that the county \nwould  use  invalidated  written  civil  service  exam  and  \n                                       \n5 It is beyond question that the Court relied upon this statement by counsel \nin its opinion.  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 646.   \n  10 \n\ninterim  relief  and  events  had  irrevocably  eradicated  the \naffects  of  the  alleged  violation).    Further,  there  is \nnothing in the prayer for relief for a Court to provide for \nNelson.   \n  In  sum,  this  Court’s  independent  medical  expert  has \nfound  that  Nelson’s  execution  can  be  carried  out  through \nreadily  accessible  veins,  requiring  only  a  peripheral \nstick.  There will be no “cut down” employed on Nelson at \nany time in the future.  There is no indication that “there \nis  going  to  have  to  be  central  access.”    Pursuant  to \nNelson’s  own  representations  and  in  the  light  of  the \nindependent  expert’s  report  this  lawsuit  is  moot.  \nAccordingly, summary judgment is appropriate.  See U.S. v. \nSoriede,  461  F.3d  1351,  1354  (11th  Cir.  Aug.  24,  2006) \n(Summary  judgment  appropriate  where  there  is  no  genuine \nissue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law).   \n  11 \n\n  The  State  of  Alabama  will  have  present  at  Nelson’s \nexecution an emergency medical technician (paramedic level)6 \nand a medical doctor.  An emergency medical technician fits \nwithin the category of personnel described by Dr. Bagley as \nhaving the necessary skills to gain venous access through a \nperipheral stick.   \n  Summary  judgment  is  appropriate  in  this  case.    The \nevidence before the Court establishes that  the State will \nbe  able  to  gain  venous  access  through  Nelson’s  “readily \naccessible”  peripheral  veins  as  indicated  in  Dr.  Bagley’s \nreport.    There  is  no  genuine  question  of  material  fact \nremaining as to whether Nelson must fear the employment of \nany predicate act to gain venous access other than through \na  peripheral  stick.    Doc.  110,  Ex.  1,  p.  13.  (“However, \ngiven  the  accessibility  of  the  peripheral  veins  listed \n                                       \n6\n  Paramedic  certification  is  the  highest  level  of  emergency  medical \ntechnician certification in Alabama.  Ala. Admin. Code R. 420-2-1-.14(1) (“An \nactively licensed EMT-Paramedic is an individual who has met all requirements \nfor  licensure  as  an  EMT-Intermediate  and  who  has  also  been  trained  in \nadditional emergency medical procedures through the EMT-Paramedic course of \ninstruction, or its equivalent, as approved by the State Board of Health, and \nwho, after having passed the approved EMT-Paramedic examination and completed \nthe appropriate credentialing requirements, has been granted a license by the \nState Board of Health to regularly perform emergency medical procedures at \nthe basic, intermediate, and paramedic levels.”).  See also, Ala. Admin. Code \nR. 420-2-1-.14(a) and (b) (“…Drugs may be administered via the intravenous, \nsubcutaneous,  intramuscular,  oral,  sublingual,  rectal  routes,  and  through \ninhalers and endotracheal tubes if approved for such administration by the \nState Board of Health; and (b) Within the constraints specified in section \n420-2-1-.07 of these rules, administration of drugs and maintenance of I.V. \n \ndrips for inter-hospital transfer patients.”).\n  12 \n\nabove, it is my medical opinion that cannulation of central \nveins  will  not  be  necessary  to  obtain  venous  access  on \nDavid  Larry  Nelson.”)7    There  is  no  evidence  before  this \nCourt  to  suggest  that  Nelson’s  execution  will  be  any \ndifferent  from  the  11  previous  lethal  injections \nadministered through peripheral venous access. \n  Finally, as this Court has already ruled, see Nelson v. \nCampbell,  286  F.Supp.2d  1321,  1323  (M.D.  Ala.  2003), \ndefendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Nelson’s \nstate  law  cause  of  action  as  alleged  in  the  complaint.  \nPennhurst State School and Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 \n(1984).    Accordingly,  this  aspect  of  Nelson’s  second \namended  complaint  cannot  form  the  basis  for  further \nproceedings before this Court.  \n                                       \n7 Although it does not appear that a percutaneous central line placement will \nbe required, Dr. Bagley also resolved the dispute as to the qualifications \nneeded to perform such a procedure.  It was this question that the Court \nexpressed a desire to resolve during the October 6, 2004 status conference.  \nContrary  to  Nelson’s  characterization  of  this  procedure  as  a  specialized \nsurgical procedure requiring a physician specialist, Dr. Bagley has indicated \nthat  an  “MD”  would  suffice,  as  would  a  physician’s  assistant  (non-medical \ndoctor) or a certified registered nurse anesthetist.  This is consistent with \nthe State’s position that an MD is qualified to perform this procedure.  This \nalso refutes counsel for Nelson’s previous assertion that doctors must have a \ncertification before being able to perform this procedure.   \n  13 \n\nCONCLUSION \n  For  these  reasons,  defendants  request  this  Court  to \nenter  an  order  dismissing  Nelson’s  second  amended \ncomplaint, recognizing that it is moot and that no genuine \nquestion of material fact or law remains before the Court. \n    Respectfully submitted, \n \n    TROY KING \n    ATTORNEY GENERAL \n \n \n  /s/ J.

The  United \nStates Supreme Court recently issued its decision in Baze \nv. Rees, __ U.S. __, 128 S.Ct. 1520 (Apr. 16, 2008), ruling \nthat  Kentucky’s  lethal  injection  protocol  and  States  with \nsubstantially  similar  protocols  do  not  violate  the  Eighth \nAmendment.    Id.,  128  S.Ct.  at  1537.    Accordingly,  the \ndefendants renew their previously filed motion for summary \njudgment,  see  Doc.  118,  and  reincorporate  all  previously \nfiled motions for summary dismissal, see Docs. 42, 63, and \n118.    The  defendants  state  the  following  regarding  the \nSupreme Court’s Baze decision.   \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 159    Filed 05/15/08   Page 2 of 7\n  By a 7-2 vote, the Supreme Court held that Kentucky’s \nthree-drug  lethal  injection  protocol  for  executing  death-\nsentenced  inmates  does  not  violate  the  Eighth  Amendment’s \nban on cruel and unusual punishment.  Baze, 128 S.Ct. 1520.  \nKentucky’s protocol uses three chemicals: sodium thiopental \nto  render  the  inmate  unconscious;  pancuronium  bromide  to \ncause paralysis and stop breathing; and potassium chloride \nto cause cardiac arrest.  Id., 128 S.Ct. at 1528.  Alabama \nuses the same  three chemicals in carrying out executions.  \nSee  Williams  v.  Allen,  No.  2:07-cv-307-MEF-SRW;  2007  WL \n2206846  (M.D.  Ala.  2007)(listing  chemicals);  Arthur  v. \nAllen, No. 07-0722-WS, 2007 WL 4105113 (S.D. Ala. Nov. 15, \n2007)(same).   \n  The  plurality  opinion  found  that  to  constitute  cruel \nand  unusual  punishment  under  the  Eighth  Amendment,  an \ninmate must show that a method of execution (1) presents a \n“substantial” or “objectively intolerable” risk of serious \nharm,  and  that  (2)  the  State,  for  no  “legitimate \npenological  justification,”  refused  to  adopt  a  proffered \nalternative  procedure  that  is  “feasible,  readily \nimplemented, and in fact significantly reduce[s]” that risk \nof severe pain.  Id., 128 S.Ct. at 1537-38.  Applying that \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 159    Filed 05/15/08   Page 3 of 7\nstandard, the plurality noted that “at least” 30 of the 36 \nStates that impose capital punishment use  the same three-\ndrug protocol  used by Kentucky, which makes “it difficult \nto  regard  [the]  practice  as  ‘objectively  intolerable.’”  \nId.,  128  S.Ct.  at  1532-33.    The  inmate  in  Baze  conceded \nthat, if the drugs are administered properly, the protocol \nwould be humane and constitutional because the first drug, \nsodium  thiopental,  ensures  that  the  inmate  would  not \nexperience  any  pain  associated  with  the  subsequent \ninjections.    Id.,  128  S.Ct.  at  1530-31.    Instead,  they \nargued  that  there  is  an  unnecessary  risk  that  the  sodium \nthiopental  will  not  be  properly  administered,  which  would \nresult  in  severe  suffering  once  the  other  chemicals  are \ninjected.    The  plurality  opinion  rejected  this  argument, \nfinding that the inmate failed to show that the risk of an \ninadequate  dose  is  either  substantial  or  objectively \nintolerable.  Id., 128 S.Ct. at 1537-38. \n  The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Baze applies to \nAlabama’s  execution  protocol  because  it  is  substantially \nsimilar  to  Kentucky’s.    Alabama,  like  Kentucky,  has  a \nthree-drug  sequence  to  induce  death:  (1)  a  rapid-acting \nanesthetic  (sodium  pentothal);  (2)  a  drug  inducing  muscle \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 159    Filed 05/15/08   Page 4 of 7\nparalysis  (pancuronium  bromide);  and  (3)  a  drug \nadministered  to  stop  the  heart  (potassium  chloride).  \nArthur, 2007 WL 4105113 at *1.  In Baze, the Supreme Court \ndefinitively held that Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol \ndoes  not  violate  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  prohibition  of \ncruel and unusual punishment.  Baze, 128 S.Ct. at 1532-38.  \nThe Baze Court, in ruling that “a lethal injection protocol \nsubstantially  similar  to  the  protocol  we  uphold  today” \ncomplies with the Constitution, removed any question as to \nthe  constitutionality  of  Alabama’s  lethal  injection \nprotocol.  Baze, 128 S.Ct. at 1537.  It is indeed possible \nthat  all  nine  United  States  Supreme  Court  Justices  would \nhold  that  Alabama’s  execution  protocol  is  constitutional.  \nJustice Ginsburg’s dissent in Baze emphasized that Alabama, \namong  several  other  States,  has  adopted  the  safeguard  of \nassessing  consciousness  after  the  anesthesia  is  injected.  \nBaze, 128 S.Ct. at 1571 (quoting that portion of Alabama’s \nexecution protocol).  The dissent argued that the lack of a \nconsciousness  assessment  check  in  Kentucky’s  lethal \ninjection was a constitutional deficiency.  Id.  Thus, the \nBaze decision has direct application to Alabama’s execution \nprotocol.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 159    Filed 05/15/08   Page 5 of 7\n  Applying  the  standard  annunciated  in  Baze,  Alabama’s \nexecution protocol as applied to Nelson is constitutional.1  \nAs  this  Court  remembers,  Dr.  Bagley,  the  Court’s \nindependent  medical  expert,  concluded  that  Nelson  “has \nreadily  accessible  peripheral  veins”  and  that  access  to \n“central  veins  will  not  be  necessary  to  obtain  venous \naccess  on  David  Larry  Nelson.”    Doc.  110,  Ex.  1,  p.  13.  \nBased on Dr. Bagley’s findings, Nelson’s execution may be \ncarried out through standard peripheral intravenous access, \nusing  personnel  with  basic  intravenous  skills.    As \npreviously asserted by the defendants, see Doc. 118 at 13, \nan emergency medical technician (paramedic level) will gain \nintravenous  access  at  Nelson’s  execution.2    Under  Alabama \nlaw,  an  EMT-Paramedic  is  qualified  and  certified  to \nadminister  drugs  intravenously.    See  Doc.  118  at  13  n.6 \n(citing  Ala.  Admin.  Code  R.  420-2-1-.14  (a)  and  (b)).  \nUsing  qualified  execution  team  members  does  not  cause  a \n“substantial” or “objectively intolerable” risk of serious \n                                                           \n1\n Any attempt by Nelson to raise a general lethal injection challenge would be \nbarred by the relevant statute of limitations.  McNair v. Allen, 515 F.3d \n1168, 1174 (11th Cir. 2008)(“We hold a method of execution claim accrues on \nthe later of the date on which state review is complete, or the date on which \nthe  capital  litigant  becomes  subject  to  a  new  or  substantially  changed \nexecution protocol.”). \n2\n A medical doctor is available in the unlikely event that a central line \nprocedure is required.  See Doc. 118 at 13.    \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 159    Filed 05/15/08   Page 6 of 7\nharm.    Thus,  Baze  offers  additional  support  to  summarily \ndismiss this case.   \nCONCLUSION \n  For these reasons and those asserted in Docs. 42, 63, \nand  118,  defendants  request  this  Court  to  enter  an  order \ndismissing  Nelson’s  second  amended  complaint,  recognizing \nthat  it  is  moot  and  that  no  genuine  question  of  material \nfact or law remains before the Court. \n    Respectfully submitted, \n \n    Troy King \n    Attorney General \n \n \n  s/ J.

      "text": "347 F.3d 910 (2003)\nDavid Larry NELSON, Plaintiff-Appellant,\nv.\nDonal CAMPBELL, in his individual and official capacity as Commissioner of the Alabama\nDepartment of Corrections, Grantt Culliver, Defendants-Appellees.\nNo. 03-15095.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.\nOctober 8, 2003.\n911 *911 Harriet Victoria Smith, Michael K. McIntyre, Law Office of Michael McIntyre, Atlanta, GA, for Plaintiff-\nAppellant.\nJ. Clayton Crenshaw, Michael Boysie Billingsley, Alabama Atty. Gen., Montgomery, AL, for Defendants-Appellees.\nBefore ANDERSON, HULL and WILSON, Circuit Judges.\nANDERSON, Circuit Judge:\nDavid Larry Nelson is an Alabama inmate convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. On October 6,\n2003, three days prior to his scheduled execution, Nelson filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action in the Middle District of\nAlabama. In his complaint, Nelson asserts that he has severely compromised veins and that Alabama's proposed\nuse of a \"cut-down\" procedure to gain venous access (if access to a suitable vein cannot be achieved) as part of\nthe lethal injection procedure constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth\n[1]\nAmendments.  Nelson further asserts a state law claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, alleging that he has\nbeen denied access to his physician in violation of Alabama law. Among other relief, Nelson requests an order\ngranting injunctive relief and staying his execution scheduled for October 9, 2003. By order dated October 7,\n2003, the district court dismissed Nelson's complaint for lack of jurisdiction. We affirm.\nAs we stated in Hill v. Hopper, 112 F.3d 1088, 1088-89 (11th Cir.1997), \"a prisoner may not circumvent the rules\nregarding second or successive habeas petitions by filing a § 1983 claim.\" See also Felker v. Turpin, 101 F.3d 95\n(11th Cir.1996); Spivey v. State Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, 279 F.3d 1301 (11th Cir.2002).\nThe full procedural history of this case prior to the instant § 1983 claim is set out in detail in Nelson v. Alabama,\n292 F.3d 1291, 1293-94 (11th Cir.2002). However, for the purposes of this appeal it is sufficient to state that\nNelson previously filed a federal habeas petition on April 14, 1997, alleging error due to the trial court's failure to\nconduct a Faretta hearing prior to allowing him to proceed pro se at his 1994 re-sentencing hearing. Nelson v.\n[2]\nAlabama, 292 F.3d at 1294.\n912 *912 Because Nelson has previously filed a federal habeas petition, we are confronted with the question of\nwhether Nelson's complaint seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 constitutes the \"functional equivalent\" of a\nsecond or successive habeas petition, such that it would be subject to the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 2244. \nFugate v. Dep't of Corrs., 301 F.3d 1287, 1288 (11th Cir.2002); Hill v. Hopper, 112 F.3d at 1089; Felker v. Turpin,\n[3]\n101 F.3d at 96. Nelson's § 1983 claim alleges that Alabama's proposed possible  use of the \"cut-down\"\nprocedure to gain venous access as part of the lethal injection procedure constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment. We addressed a similar § 1983 claim in Fugate v. Department of Corrections, 301 F.3d 1287. The\nplaintiff in Fugate asserted, among other challenges to the State of Georgia's lethal injection procedure, that the\nuse of a \"cut-down\" procedure in the absence of a suitable vein violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nCompl. for Injunctive Relief and Decl. J., filed Aug. 12, 2002, ¶¶ 24-28, Fugate v. Dep't of Corrs., No. 02-02219-\nCV-CC (N.D.Ga. Aug. 13, 2002). On appeal, we held that the district court properly dismissed the § 1983 action\nto \"enjoin and restrain the defendants from executing [Fugate] until they [took] certain measure[s] to minimize the\nrisk of unnecessary pain, suffering and mutilation during the execution process,\" because the § 1983 action\n\nconstituted the \"functional equivalent\" of a second habeas petition. 301 F.3d at 1288. Pursuant to Fugate, we\nconclude that Nelson's § 1983 claim also constitutes the \"functional equivalent\" of a second habeas petition as it\nseeks an immediate stay to the imposition of Nelson's death sentence. See Fugate, 301 F.3d at 1288; Spivey v.\nState Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, 279 F.3d 1301, 1303 & n. 4. We believe that the instant case is\nindistinguishable from Fugate; both sought to minimize the risk of unnecessary pain during the execution\nprocess, and both sought to stay the execution until appropriate corrective measures were taken.\nBecause Nelson's § 1983 claim was the \"functional equivalent\" of a second habeas petition and because Nelson\ndid not get our permission to file a second habeas petition prior to filing in the district court as required by 28\nU.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A), the district court properly dismissed Nelson's § 1983 claim for lack of jurisdiction to\nentertain the claim. Fugate, 301 F.3d at 1288; Hill, 112 F.3d at 1089. Moreover, even had Nelson sought our\npermission to file a second habeas petition, the facts alleged indicate that Nelson's application would have been\ndenied pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2) because his cruel and unusual punishment claim neither \"relies on a\nnew rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was\npreviously unavailable,\" nor has a \"factual predicate for the claim [that] could not have been discovered\npreviously through the exercise of due diligence ... [that] if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,\nwould be sufficient to establish ... that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the\napplicant guilty of the underlying offense.\" See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2); Felker v. Turpin, 101 F.3d at 97; In re\n913 Provenzano, 215 F.3d 1233, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2000) (involving an application for second habeas petition *913\nchallenging lethal injection as administered by the State of Florida as cruel and unusual punishment and\ndismissing it because the claim did not meet the requirements of § 2244(b)(2)).\nWith respect to Nelson's state law claim, we agree with the district court that it is barred by Pennhurst State\nSchool & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106, 104 S.Ct. 900, 911, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1994).\nFor the foregoing reasons the district court's judgment dismissing Nelson's complaint is affirmed. Nelson's motion\nto enjoin defendants from executing him is denied.\n[4] [5]\nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED , and Nelson's motion for stay of execution is DENIED.\nWILSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nThe majority holds that Nelson's Eighth Amendment claim challenging the unique manner of his execution, filed\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, is the \"functional equivalent\" of a habeas petition, and is therefore subject to the\nrequirements governing second or successive habeas petitions under 28 U.S.C. § 2244. In light of the clear\nauthority indicating that Nelson's claim should be construed exclusively under § 1983, I strongly disagree with the\nmajority's holding.\nNelson seeks only a temporary stay of execution until concerns regarding the manner of his execution are\n[1]\naddressed.\n914 A complaint seeking § 1983 relief in the form of a temporary stay of execution *914 is not automatically equivalent\nto a successive habeas petition. Before making the determination of whether such a stay should be considered a\nhabeas petition or a civil rights action, the court must inquire into the fundamental question of whether the plaintiff\nis actually seeking to challenge either the fact of his conviction or the duration of his sentence-the touch-stones of\n[2]\nhabeas relief.  If the plaintiff's § 1983 complaint \"would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or\nsentence,\" the complaint must be dismissed. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d\n383 (1994). On the contrary, \"if the plaintiff's action . . . even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of\nany outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of\nsome other bar to the suit.\" Id. In this case, Nelson was sentenced to death by lethal injection, not by lethal\ninjection subject to any painful secondary procedure that Alabama state prison officials deem appropriate. He\nthus challenges neither his conviction nor his sentence. Rather, he requests the opportunity to enforce his Eighth\nAmendment rights; an opportunity that, as noted by the district court, would be wholly absent if this action were\ndeemed the equivalent of a second habeas petition.\n\nAppellees assert that this case is controlled by this court's decision in Fugate v. Dep't of Corrs., 301 F.3d 1287\n(11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam). In Fugate, an inmate sought a stay of execution, alleging that the manner in which\nGeorgia administered its lethal injections was cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment. We held that the\ndistrict court lacked jurisdiction to consider Fugate's claim because it was the functional equivalent of a second\nhabeas petition, and he had not previously applied to this court for permission to file such a petition under § 2244\n(b)(3)(A). See Fugate, 301 F.3d at 1288. Although the facts in Fugate are similar to those in this case, Fugate\ndoes not control the question before us. Fugate was sentenced to death by lethal injection under Georgia law. By\nseeking a stay of execution on the basis of a challenge to Georgia's method of administering its lethal injections,\nFugate was, in effect, attempting to avoid his specific sentence. Therefore, the decision that Fugate's claim was\n[3]\nthe \"functional equivalent\" of a successive habeas petition was reasonable.  The same is true of our decisions\n915 in Hill v. Hopper, 112 F.3d 1088 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (holding that an inmate's constitutional challenge to \n*915 electrocution as means of execution was the functional equivalent of a second habeas petition) and Felker\nv. Turpin, 101 F.3d 95 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Here, however, Nelson is not seeking to avoid execution by\nlethal injection under Alabama law. The \"cut down\" procedure that is to be used in his execution is not within\nAlabama's execution procedure, nor has it been reviewed to ensure that it passes muster under the Eighth\nAmendment. Nelson merely requests that a different, more humane procedure known as \"percutaneous central\nvenous cannulation\" be used to carry out his execution, rather than the outmoded and painful \"cut down\"\nprocedure. Regardless of which procedure is used, Nelson will be executed by lethal injection in accordance with\nhis sentence. However, with the implementation of the \"cut down\" procedure, Nelson's Eighth Amendment rights\nmay be compromised in the process.\nThe district court noted that the rulings of the Eleventh Circuit appear to make a distinction between cases in\nwhich a death row inmate's execution is imminent and cases in which execution is not imminent. In Bradley v.\nPryor, 305 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir.2002), which was decided within weeks of Fugate, we held that a death row\ninmate's § 1983 action for production of DNA evidence was not a successive habeas petition because it \"neither\ndirectly, nor by necessary implication, attack[ed] the validity of his conviction and sentence.\" Bradley, 305 F.3d at\n1288. In his concurrence, and without further explanation, Chief Judge Edmondson stressed that the fact that\nBradley did not request a stay of his execution as part of his claim was an \"important\" part of his decision. Id. at\n1292 (Edmondson, C.J., concurring).\nHowever, I fail to see the relevance of a request for a stay of execution to the question of whether an action is the\nequivalent of a habeas petition. In Gilreath v. State Bd. of Pardons & Paroles, 273 F.3d 932 (11th Cir.2001) (per\ncuriam), we held that a death row inmate's motion for a preliminary injunction to stay his execution pending an\nappeal in a clemency proceeding was equivalent to a second habeas petition. However, we did not hold that \nevery motion for a stay of execution was tantamount to a petition for habeas relief. In fact, we stated in the\nopinion that \"[w]e look to the kind of relief [the inmate] seeks from the federal courts\" in determining whether a\npetitioner seeks habeas relief. Id. at 933. Since the inmate in Gilreath sought clemency, or relief from his penalty,\nit was clear that his petition for a stay of execution was for the purpose of attacking his sentence. Here, Nelson's\nrequest for a stay has no bearing on his conviction or his sentence, nor will it ever. If his stay is granted, he will at\nmost have a limited opportunity to pursue his Eighth Amendment claims. Whatever the outcome, Nelson will be\nexecuted.\nNelson asks not to be spared; he asks only that he be executed humanely in accordance with his constitutional\nrights. The bottom line in this case is that the outcome of Nelson's petition has no effect on either his sentence or\nhis conviction, and therefore cannot properly be construed under any circumstances as the equivalent to a\nsubsequent habeas petition. Therefore, pursuant to Heck v. Humphrey, Nelson's § 1983 action should be allowed\nto proceed. 512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. I respectfully dissent.\n[1] The \"cut-down\" procedure would require making a two inch incision in Nelson's upper arm for the purpose of\nlocating a peripheral vein to perform a central line procedure. The procedure would be performed using local\nanesthetic.\n\n[2] Additionally, Nelson, through his counsel, acknowledged that he had exhausted all available habeas corpus\nrelief and that he would have to get permission from the Eleventh Circuit in order to file a second or successive\nhabeas petition. Tr. of In-Chambers Tel. Conference, Oct. 7, 2003, at *22-23.\n[3] We say \"possible\" because Alabama first proposes to gain venous access through a femoral vein in Nelson's\nthigh and if unsuccessful through the external carotid artery in Nelson's neck, neither of which procedure Nelson\nchallenges. It is only if venous access cannot be readily gained in those two areas that Alabama proposes to use\nthe third alternative of the \"cut-down\" procedure.\n[4] While the dissent's distinction of Felker v. Turpin, Hill v. Hopper, and possibly even Gilreath v. State Board of\nPardons & Paroles, 273 F.3d 932 (11th Cir.2001), may be plausible, we believe its attempt to distinguish Fugate\nis flawed. As noted in our opinion, we do not believe Fugate is distinguishable. Fugate was no more attempting to\navoid his sentence than is Nelson. Both asserted that they were not challenging their sentence. See Compl. for\nInjunctive Relief and Decl. J., filed Aug. 12, 2002, at *1, Fugate v. Dep't of Corrs., No. 02-02219-CV-CC (N.D.Ga.\nAug. 13, 2002) (first sentence) (\"Fugate ... brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 challenging not his\nsentence of death, nor lethal injection as a manner of inflicting death, but the failure of Georgia officials in\nchanging from electrocution to lethal injection to take sufficient measures to minimize the risk of him experiencing\nextreme and excruciating pain\"). In both this case and in Fugate, the appellants suggested less painful alternative\nways to implement lethal injection. In short, both cases sought to \"enjoin ... the defendants from executing him \nuntil they take certain measures to minimize the risk of unnecessary pain.\" Fugate, 301 F.3d at 1288 (emphasis\nadded). \nWe also reject the dissent's suggestion that Nelson's attempt to stay his execution is irrelevant to the \"functional\nequivalent\" issue. See Spivey v. State Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, 279 F.3d at 1303 (reviewing our decision in \nGilreath and stating \"In reviewing the denial of a motion for preliminary injunction to stay Gilreath's execution, the\nCourt held that `[w]e look at the kind of relief Appellant seeks and conclude that, however the Appellant describes\nit, the motion was for habeas corpus relief.'\"); see also Spivey, 279 F.3d at 1304 n. 4 (distinguishing the claim in \nSpivey from the claim in Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard, 523 U.S. 272, 118 S.Ct. 1244, 140 L.Ed.2d 387\n(1998), stating \"There, no execution date was imminent, and there is no indication that Woodard's claims would\nnecessarily imply a challenge to the imposition of a death sentence.\"). Nelson's prayer to stay his execution\ndirectly impedes the implementation of the state sentence, and is indicative of an effort to accomplish via § 1983\nthat which cannot be accomplished by a successive petition for habeas corpus. Bradley v. Pryor, 305 F.3d 1287\n(11th Cir.2002), is readily distinguished from the instant case. That case involved no attempt to stay Bradley's\nexecution, and no attempt to interfere with the implementation of the state sentence.\n[5] The Appellant's request for oral argument is denied.\n[1] The majority notes that Nelson filed his § 1983 claim only three days prior to his execution. However, the\nprocedure at issue here had never before been implemented in Alabama and prison officials had to craft a special\nprocedure to govern Nelson's execution. It is unclear at what point they finalized the procedure and notified\nNelson of it. Even in light of the chance that Nelson seeks redress in the courts solely as a means of delaying the\ninevitable, the possibility of his only recently being notified of the procedure requires our caution.\n[2] A court \"shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to\nthe judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or\ntreaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (2003) (emphasis added). Here, Nelson does not make such a\nchallenge.\n[3] Nevertheless, I believe that our decisions in Fugate and its prior related cases are questionable under the\nstandards defining habeas actions. A challenge to the manner in which an inmate is executed, in general, is not\nnecessarily a challenge to the inmate's sentence of death or his conviction. The inmate's execution will\npresumably proceed, either in the same manner or in a different manner, pending subsequent proceedings. An\navenue for review of Eighth Amendment claims must remain available to those facing death at the hands of the\nstate.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Introduction. \n \nThe  Defendants  have  filed  a  Renewed  Motion  for  Summary \nJudgment.  The sole basis for the Defendants’ Renewed Motion for \nSummary  Judgment  is  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Baze  v. \nRees,  553  U.  S.  ___,  128  S.Ct.  1520  (2008).   The  Defendants’ \nRenewed Motion for Summary Judgment must be denied because their \nreliance  upon  Baze  is  misplaced.   As  will  be  discussed  below, \nthe  decision  in  Baze  supports  the  Plaintiff’s  claims  and  is \nconsistent with the Plaintiff’s contention that his §1983 action \n  1\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 2 of 17\nrequires  full  development  of  the  facts  connected  with  that \naction. \nThe  Defendants’  Renewed  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  must \nalso be denied because genuine issues of material fact exist as \nto  the  claims  raised  in  the  Plaintiff’s  Second  Amended \nComplaint.  \nMost  strikingly,  the  Defendants  in  their  May  15,  2008 \nRenewed Motion for Summary judgment state: \n \nAs this Court remembers, Dr. Bagley, the Court’s \nindependent  medical  expert,  concluded  that \nNelson “has readily accessible peripheral veins” \nand  that  access  to  “central  veins  will  not  be \nnecessary to obtain venous access on David Larry \nNelson.” Doc. 110, Ex. 1, p. 13. Based on Dr. \nBagley’s  findings,  Nelson’s  execution  may  be \ncarried  out  through  standard  peripheral \nintravenous  access,  using  personnel  with  basic \nintravenous skills.  \n \n (Doc.  159  at  Page  5,  footnotes  omitted).    The  Defendants’ \nassertion  in  their  Renewed  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  is \ninconsistent with the record in a multitude of ways, including \n(1)  Defendant  Culliver’s  October  6,  2003  Affidavit,  in  which \nDefendant  Culliver  attests  to  information  which  demonstrates \nthat  medical  personnel  under  the  direction  of  the  Defendants \nhave  been  unable  in  the  past  to  find  the  peripheral  venous \naccess  sites  identified  by  Dr.  Bagley  in  his  report  and  to \ncannulate the veins which Dr. Bagley describes as being “easily \ncannulated by most persons with basic intravenous skills”;  (2) \n  2\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 3 of 17\nDr. Delano Benjamin’s August 23, 2004 “Report on Venous Access \nfor David Larry Nelson Conducted August 23, 2004” in which Dr. \nBenjamin,  who  examined  the  Plaintiff  on  behalf  of  the \nDefendants,  reports  that  he  is  “unable  to  offer  a  definite \nopinion regarding whether peripheral access will be achievable” \nduring the Plaintiff’s execution and allows for the alternative \nthat if “such attempts are unsuccessful, a central line can be \nutilized  to  obtain  access”;    Dr.  Delano  Benjamin’s  August  23, \n2004  and  August  26,  2004  notations  in  the  Plaintiff’s  medical \nrecords  in  which  he  respectively  states  “Pt  may  need  central \nline for IV access” and “Spoke with Mr. Billingsly from Attorney \nGeneral’s  Office  about  veinous  (sic)  access  for  David  Nelson, \nsee  above  note.    Pt.  may  need  central  line  done  for  veinous \n(sic) access”;  and (3) the December 10, 2007 report from the \nAtmore  Community  Hospital  which  is  part  of  the  Plaintiff’s \nmedical records and which includes such remarks as, “IV access \ncould not be obtained in this patient”; “IV contrast could not \nbe done…”; and “Suboptimal study since no IV contrast could be \nobtained  in  this  patient…”.    Furthermore,  the  Defendants’ \nassertion  in  their  Renewed  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  is \ninconsistent  with  the  June  9,  2008  report  from  the  Atmore \nCommunity  Hospital  regarding  the  recent  Magnetic  Resonance \n  3\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 4 of 17\nImaging (MRI) of the Plaintiff’s abdomen, that report explicitly \nstating, “Unable to get IV access”.1\nAdditionally, the Plaintiff notes that (1) no discovery has \nbeen  conducted  in  the  Plaintiff’s  case  and  (2)  the  Defendants \nhave never filed an answer to the Plaintiff’s initial Complaint, \nAmended Complaint, or Second Amended Complaint.  Precedent from \nthe  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  and  the  United  States \nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (hereinafter referred \nto as “the Eleventh Circuit”) clearly dictates that a motion for \nsummary  judgment  should  be  considered  by  a  court  only  after \ndiscovery  has  been  conducted  and  an  adequate  record  has  been \nmade.    \nII.  The Defendant's Reliance on Baze v. Rees is Misplaced \n \n  A.  Baze v. Rees Supports the Plaintiff's Claims \n \nBaze  v.  Rees  determined  whether  Kentucky’s  protocols  for \nlethal injection violated the Eighth Amendment.  Indeed Baze is \nthe  first  time  that  the  Supreme  Court  had  considered  the \nconstitutionality of a method of execution since it upheld the \nuse of the electric chair in In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436 (1890).  \nSee Denno, Deborah W., \"Death Bed,\"  Tri Quarterly Journal, Vol. \n124,  pp.  141-68,  2006.    While  upholding  Kentucky’s  lethal \ninjection  procedure,  Baze  unequivocally  holds  that  the  Eighth \nAmendment  is  violated  when  a  condemned  establishes  that  his \n                                                 \n1 This report is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.   \n  4\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 5 of 17\nexecution will involve a “substantial risk of serious harm” or \nan “objectively intolerable risk of harm…” based on how it is to \nbe  carried  out.    128  S.Ct.  at  1531  (plurality  opinion).    The \nharm to be avoided is the conscious and needless suffering of \npain.  128 S.Ct. at 1537-38 (plurality opinion). \nComplainants  in  Baze  contended  that  Kentucky’s  three \nchemical  sequential  protocol  relying  on  a  barbiturate  (sodium \nthiopental),  followed  by  a  paralyzing  agent  (pancuronium \nbromide), and concluding with a drug that would induce cardiac \narrest (potassium chloride) posed such a risk primarily due to \nthe  danger  that  the  barbiturate  dose  would  be  too  low  to \neffectively sedate the condemned.  128 S.Ct. at 1530.  Without \nadequate  sedation,  according  to  the  complainants,  the  induced \nheart  attack  would  result  in  unconscionable  pain  which  the \nparalyzing agent would mask.  After weighing evidence produced \nat  “extensive  hearings”  and  considering  detailed  lower  court \nfact  findings,  128  S.Ct.  at  1526,  1529,  the  Supreme  Court \nconcluded that complainants’ proof did not make out the risk of \nharm necessary to show an Eight Amendment violation.     \nAs in Baze, the Plaintiff in the present case contends that \nhis  execution  would  constitute  cruel  and  unusual  punishment \nbecause  it  would  subject  him  to  an  unconstitutional  degree  of \npain.    Unlike  Baze,  the  Plaintiff  does  not  maintain  that  the \nrisk  of  pain  stems  from  the  use  of  the  Alabama’s  lethal \n  5\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 6 of 17\ninjection protocol per se and the adverse effect of the three \nchemical  mix  to  cause  death.    Instead,  the  Plaintiff  asserts \nthat  the  administration  of  the  protocol  to  the  Plaintiff  will \nresult  in  a  substantial  and  objectively  intolerable  risk  of \nserious  harm  due  to  the  Plaintiff’s  medical  condition  and \nseverely compromised peripheral veins.  The Plaintiff’s lawsuit \nhinges  on  facts  which  he  contends  show  that,  given  his \ncondition,  intravenous  access  via  the  techniques  that  the \nDefendants  intend  to  use  pose  unacceptable  risks  of  pain  and \ninjury and that readily available medical procedures other than \nthose contemplated by the Defendants are far less intrusive and \ninvolve substantially less risk.  As a consequence, unlike Baze, \nthe  Plaintiff’s  “suit  [does]  not  challenge  an  execution \nprocedure  required  by  law,  so  granting  relief  would  not  imply \nthe  unlawfulness  of  the  lethal  injection  sentence.”    Hill  v. \nMcDonough,  547  U.S.  573,  580  (2006),  citing  and  relying  on \nNelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 647 (2004).   \nB.  Baze  v.  Rees  Is  Consistent  With  The  Plaintiff's \nContention  That  His  §1983  Action  Requires  Full \nDevelopment Of The Facts \n \nA  majority  in  Baze  rejected  any  reading  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment  that  would  require  courts  to  parse  out  and  micro \nmanage execution protocols.  128 S.Ct. at 1537-38.  Nonetheless, \nthe  Supreme  Court  was  only  able  to  make  the  judgment  it  did \nafter considering a fully developed record.  The Supreme Court \n  6\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 7 of 17\nconcluded that the complainants did not make out the requisite \nrisk  of  pain  after  a  full  and  complete  review  of  Kentucky’s \nlethal injection protocol and practice and consideration of the \noperation of that protocol in light of expert and lay testimony.  \nThus, the full scope of the procedures Kentucky used to carry \nout sentences of death was a part of the record before the trial \ncourt,  the  state  supreme  court,  and  the  Supreme  Court  of  the \nUnited States.  128 S.Ct. at 1527-29.  The record of proceedings \nfrom a seven day full trial was used to establish what chemicals \nKentucky would use, the dosages, the sequence of administration, \nthe means of administration, the personnel who would carry out \nthe process, the personnel who would oversee how the process was \ncarried out, the steps that would be taken to make sure that the \ncondemned  was  not  alert  or  otherwise  conscious,  the  staffing \nbackground  requirements  and  training  that  would  be  used  to \nensure  that  practice  conformed  to  regulations.    Back  up  and \nemergency  contingencies  were  considered.    Lethal  injection  as \ndesigned  and  practiced  was  subjected  to  the  scrutiny  of  an \nevidentiary trial.  Then, and only then, was the Supreme Court \nin a position to make the judgment that the complainants had not \ndemonstrated the requisite risk of pain. \nIn  contrast  to  the  breadth  and  substance  of  the  material \nbefore the courts in Baze, the Defendants in the present case \nhave sought from the outset to limit access to evidence to the \n  7\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 8 of 17\nPlaintiff that would make it possible to rationally assess the \nrisks  the  Plaintiff  will  face  when  the  Defendants  attempt  to \nexecute  him.    It  is  only  in  their  renewed  motion  for  summary \njudgment  that  the  Defendants  are  willing  to  disclose  what \nchemicals  Alabama  uses  in  its  lethal  injection  protocol.  \nNotably, the disclosure is not based on references to the record \nin this case, but to citation references to other cases that are \nthemselves  under  protective  order.    Defendants’  Renewed  Motion \nfor Summary Judgment at 2.  Unlike in Baze, the Defendants in \nthe present case have opposed disclosure of the protocol Alabama \nuses to carry out death sentences.2  Indeed, the Defendants have \neven impaired the Plaintiff’s access to his own medical records.3  \nHere, unlike in Baze, the Defendants assert that the Plaintiff \nshould  be  denied  relief  without  going  through  the  thorough \n                                                 \n2   Notwithstanding its refusal to make the execution protocols a part of the \nrecord in this case, in its motion the Defendants make the assertion that for \npurposes  of  assessing  Baze,  “Alabama’s  execution  protocol  .  .  .  is \nsubstantially similar to Kentucky’s.”  Defendants’ Renewed Motion for Summary \nJudgment at 3.  Surely that is not the sort of conclusion or inference that \nshould be drawn ex parte in any litigation, much less in litigation centered \non the constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  \nWhether Alabama’s protocol is similar to the one Kentucky used is a question \nof fact that can only be determined after Alabama’s protocol is subjected to \nthe give and take of full adversarial process.   \n3   In fact, the Defendants refused to provide the Plaintiff with his own \nmedical records until ordered to do so by this Court.  These records clearly \ncontain information that is relevant to the issues raised in the Plaintiff’s \naction.  For example, for the past two years, the Plaintiff systematically \nhas been evaluated for suspicion of liver cancer, that evaluation including \nimaging studies being performed at the Atmore Community Hospital.  Medical \npersonnel at that hospital on multiple occasions encountered difficulty in \ntheir attempts to gain venous access to the Plaintiff and were unable, due to \nthe condition of the Plaintiff’s veins, to administer contrasting dyes to the \nPlaintiff  intravenously  for  a  CAT  scan  and  a  MRI.  See  Exhibits  1  and  3 \nattached hereto. \n     \n  8\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 9 of 17\nlitigation that preceded the Supreme Court’s decision in Baze.  \nThe Defendants’ assertion is not consistent  with Baze. \nIII. Based Upon The Current State Of The Record, The Defendants’ \nRenewed Motion For Summary Judgment Should Be Denied Because \nThere Exist Genuine Issues Of Material Facts To Be Tried.  \n \nSummary  judgment  is  appropriate  only  when  the  pleadings, \ndepositions, and affidavits submitted by the parties show that \nno genuine issue of material fact exists and that the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). An \nissue is genuine “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury \ncould  return  a  verdict  for  the  nonmoving  party.”  Anderson  v. \nLiberty  Lobby  Inc.,  477  U.S.  242,  248  (1986).  An  issue  is \nmaterial if it “might affect the outcome of the suit under the \ngoverning law.” Id. The Court should view the evidence and any \ninferences that may be drawn in the light most favorable to the \nnonmovant. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-159 \n(1970). The party seeking summary judgment must first identify \ngrounds  that  show  the  absence  of  a  genuine  issue  of  material \nfact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986). The \nburden  then  shifts  to  the  nonmovant,  who  must  go  beyond  the \npleadings  and  present  affirmative  evidence  to  show  that  a \ngenuine issue of material fact does exist. Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 257 (1986). \n  9\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 10 of 17\nThe  Defendants’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  should  be \ndenied because there exist genuine issues of material facts to \nbe tried4, including but not limited to the following: \nIssue No. 1:  Whether  Plaintiff  David  Nelson’s  veins  are \naccessible  though  the  “traditional”  procedure,  called  by  the \nparties “peripheral vein access.”  (See Paragraphs 4, 5, 17, and \n22  of  the  Affidavit  of  Mark  Heath,  M.D.,  attached  hereto  as \nExhibit 2, hereinafter, “Exhibit 2: ¶¶ 4, 5, 17, 22;  See also \nthe December 10, 2007 report from the Atmore Community Hospital, \nattached hereto as Exhibit 3 and the June 9, 2008 report from \nthe Atmore Community Hospital, attached hereto as Exhibit 1)5. \nIssue No. 2:  If  Plaintiff’s  veins  are  not  accessible \nthrough  the  peripheral  vein  access  procedure,  whether  a \n“percutaneous  central  line  procedure”  is  appropriate.  (See \nExhibit  2:  ¶¶15,  16,  28,  29,  31,  42,  43;  Dr.  Delano  R. \nBenjamin’s  Report  on  Venous  Access  for  David  Larry  Nelson \nConducted August 23, 2004, Docket Entry No. 34; Medical record \nof the Plaintiff, attached hereto as Exhibit 46). \n                                                 \n4 The first seven genuine issues of material fact were set forth by this Court \nin its July 28, 2006 Order. \n5 Exhibit 3 when provided to the Plaintiff by the Defendants was not certified.  \nThe  Plaintiff  is  serving  on  the  Defendants,  on  this  date,  a  request  for \nadmission regarding Exhibit 3.  Exhibit 1 will be the subject of a request \nfor admission after it is incorporated into the Plaintiff’s medical records. \n6 This medical record, when provided to the Plaintiff by the Defendants, was \nnot certified.  The Plaintiff served on the Defendants on December 1, 2006 a \nrequest for admission regarding this medical record.  The Defendants have \nnever filed a response to said request.  \n  10\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 11 of 17\nIssue No. 3:  If a percutaneous central line procedure is \nappropriate, through which of Plaintiff’s veins such access may \nbe obtained, including but not limited to the subclavian vein, \nthe  internal  jugular  vein,  the  external  jugular  vein,  and  the \nfemoral  vein,  and  what  advantages  and/or  complications  may \naccompany the process of access through each type of vein.  (See \nExhibit 2: ¶30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 52). \nIssue No. 4:  What  protocol(s)  will  be  required  for \nobtaining  access  to  Plaintiff’s  veins  through  the  percutaneous \ncentral line procedure(s).  (See Exhibit 2: ¶35, 36). \nIssue No. 5:  What  facilities  and  equipment  will  be \nrequired for obtaining access to Plaintiff’s veins through the \npercutaneous central line procedure(s).   (See Exhibit 2: ¶37, \n38, 53). \nIssue No. 6:  What  types  of  professionals  and  personnel \nwill  be  required  for  obtaining  access  to  Plaintiff’s  veins \nthrough  the  percutaneous  central  line  procedure(s).    (See \nExhibit 2: ¶39, 40, 55, 61). \nIssue No. 7:  Other means, if any, that may exist by which \nvenous  access  may  be  gained  on  Plaintiff,  and  what  protocols, \nfacilities,  equipment,  professionals,  and  personnel  would \ngenerally be required for each. (See Exhibit 2: ¶ 41, 42, 43). \nIssue No. 8:  Whether  the  Plaintiff  has  significantly \ncompromised peripheral access. (See Exhibit 2:¶6). \n  11\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 12 of 17\nIssue No. 9:  Whether  the  peripheral  vein  in  the \nPlaintiff’s right arm is “easily cannulated by most persons with \nbasic  intravenous  skills  (i.e.  emergency  medical \ntechnicians/paramedics  who  are  so  certified,  military  combat \nmedics, nurses, CRNAs (certified registered nurse anesthetists), \nPAs (physician’s assistants), and physicians”.  (See Exhibit 2: \n¶¶7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17; Warden Culliver’s Affidavit dated October \n6, 2003, Docket Entry No. 4; Exhibit 3, the December 10, 2007 \nreport  from  the  Atmore  Community  Hospital;  and  Exhibit  1,  the \nJune 9, 2008 report from the Atmore Community Hospital). \nIssue No. 10:  Whether  the  medical  personnel  which  the \nDefendants  plan  to  utilize  to  gain  venous  access  to  the \nPlaintiff are competent to do so.  (See Exhibit 2: ¶¶8, 9, 10, \n11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 40, 43, 56, 61). \nIssue No. 11:  Whether fluids that are administered to the \nPlaintiff  intravenously  through  the  peripheral  vein  will  flow \nproperly through the Plaintiff’s veins, particularly through any \nscarred areas and with rapid pushes of fluid.  (See Exhibit 2: \n¶¶19, 20, 21, 23). \nIssue No. 12:  Whether  the  Defendants’  protocol,  including \nthe one paragraph already disclosed to the Plaintiff, describes \nin any meaningful manner a process for gaining venous access to \nthe Plaintiff.  (Exhibit 2: ¶¶44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 62).  \n  12\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 13 of 17\nIssue No. 13:  Whether  the  Defendants’  protocol  and  their \nconduct in gaining venous access to the Plaintiff will comport \nwith  evolving  standards  of  decency  or  will  be  deliberately \nindifferent  towards  contemporary  standards  of  medical  care.  \n(See Exhibit 2: ¶¶27, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, \n57, 59, 60, 61, 62). \nIV.  The  Defendants’  Renewed  Motion  For  Summary  Judgment  Is \nPremature  Given  The  Fact  That  Discovery  Has  Not  Been \nConducted In The Plaintiff’s Case.  \n \nSince  the  Defendants  have  never  filed  an  answer,  to  date \ndiscovery has not been conducted in the Plaintiff’s case. \nPrecedent from the Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit \nclearly  dictates  that  a  motion  for  summary  judgment  should  be \nconsidered  by  a  court  only  after  discovery  has  been  conducted \nand an adequate record has been made.    \nSpecifically,  in  Celotex  Corp.  v.  Catrett,  477  U.S.  317 \n(1986), the Court stated: \nIn  our  view,  the  plain  language  of  Rule  56(c) \nmandates  the  entry  of  summary  judgment,  after \nadequate time for discovery and upon motion, against \na party who fails to make a showing sufficient to \nestablish the existence of an element essential to \nthat party’s case, and on which that party will bear \nthe burden of proof at trial. \n \nId. at 322 (emphasis added). The Court further found that: \nThe parties had conducted discovery, so no serious \nclaim can be made that respondent was in any sense \n“railroaded”  by  a  premature  motion  for  summary \njudgment.  Any potential problem with such premature \nmotions  can  be  adequately  dealt  with  under  Rule \n  13\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 14 of 17\n56(f), which allows a summary judgment motion to be \ndenied,  or  the  hearing  on  the  motion  to  be \ncontinued,  if  the  nonmoving  party  has  not  had  an \nopportunity to make full discovery. \n \nId. at 326 (emphasis added). \nIn  WSB-TV  v.  Lee,  842  F.2d  1266  (11th  Cir.1988),  the \nEleventh  Circuit  reviewed  the  Supreme  Court’s  decisions  in \nCelotex Corp., supra., Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242  (1986),  and  Matsushita  Electric  Industrial  Co.  v.  Zenith \nRadio  Corporation,  475  U.S.  574  (1986)  and  concluded  that  the \n“common denominator” of those three cases “is the Court’s caveat \nthat  summary  judgment  may  only  be  decided  upon  an  adequate \nrecord”.    WSB-TV,  842  F.2d  at  1269.    The  Eleventh  Circuit  in \nWSB-TV found that the lower court’s consideration of the motion \nfor  summary  judgment  was  erroneous,  since  “the  plaintiffs  had \nbeen afforded no opportunity for discovery”.  Id.  \nSimilarly,  in  Snook  v.  Trust  Company  of  Georgia  Bank  of \nSavannah,  N.A.,  859  F.2d  865  (11th  Cir.1988),  the  Eleventh \nCircuit  explicitly  stated,  “This  court  has  often  noted  that \nsummary judgment should not be granted until the party opposing \nthe motion has had an adequate opportunity for discovery.”  Id. \nat 870. \nSince  no  discovery  has  been  conducted  in  the  Plaintiff’s \ncase, the record in the Plaintiff’s case is incomplete and the \nDefendants’ Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment is premature. As \n  14\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 15 of 17\nsuch, the Defendants’ Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment should \nbe denied at this time by this Court.  \nV.  The  Defendants’  Renewed  Motion  For  Summary  Judgment  Is \nPremature Given The Fact That The Defendants Have Not Filed \nAn Answer To The Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint.  \n \nThe  Defendants  have  never  filed  an  answer  to  the \nPlaintiff’s  initial  Complaint,  the  Plaintiff’s  Amended \nComplaint,  or  the  Plaintiff’s  Second  Amended  Complaint.    As \nsuch,  the  record  is  incomplete  as  to  the  Defendants’  position \nregarding  the  claims  raised  in  the  Plaintiff’s  Second  Amended \nComplaint.    Consequently,  the  Defendants’  Renewed  Motion  for \nSummary Judgment is premature and should be denied at this time \nby this Court. \nVI.  Conclusion \n   \nFor the reasons stated herein, it is respectfully submitted \nthat this Court should deny the Defendants’ Renewed Motion for \nSummary  Judgment.  In  the  alternative,  it  is  respectfully \nsubmitted  that  this  Court  should  postpone  ruling  on  the \nDefendants’  Renewed  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  until  the \nDefendants  have  filed  an  answer,  the  parties  have  had  an \nadequate opportunity to conduct discovery, and the Plaintiff has \nhad  an  opportunity  to  supplement  this  Response  based  upon  the \nevidence adduced during discovery.  \nThis 21st day of July, 2008. \n               \n  15\n\nCase 2:03-cv-01008-MHT -WC   Document 168    Filed 07/21/08   Page 16 of 17\nRespectfully submitted,     \n \n/s/ Michael Kennedy McIntyre \nMICHAEL KENNEDY McINTYRE \nGeorgia Bar No. 494075 \n              Attorney for Plaintiff \n965 Virginia Avenue, NE \nAtlanta, Georgia  30306 \nTelephone (404) 879-1515 \n \n              /s/ H.
