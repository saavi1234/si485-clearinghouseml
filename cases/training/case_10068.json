    "summary": "<p>On December 17, 1999, Quitman County, Mississippi filed a lawsuit against the State of Mississippi under Article 3, Section 26 of the Mississippi Constitution, in the Circuit Court of Quitman County, Mississippi. The County claimed that the State of Mississippi's statutes requiring that the counties provide legal services for indigent defendants were unconstitutional. The County sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction to require the Mississippi State Legislature to establish a statewide public defenders office with state funding.</p>\r\n<p>On July 10, 2000, the State filed a motion to dismiss the complaint alleging that it failed to state a claim and that the County lacked legal standing to bring the suit. On August 31, 2000, the Circuit Court (Judge Elzy Jonathan Smith, Jr.) denied the State's motion to dismiss, finding that the courts and the Legislature have concurrent responsibility for the State's compliance in this area. The State appealed.</p>\r\n<p>On October 10, 2000, the Supreme Court of Mississippi granted the State's petition for interlocutory appeal. However, on October 31, 2001, the Supreme Court of Mississippi (Judge James W. Smith) affirmed, holding that the County did have standing to sue the State because \"[t]he County has a colorable interest in the State's compliance with its duty to provide effective assistance of counsel to indigent defendants under Art. 3, &sect; 26.\" State v. Quitman County, 807 So.2d 401, 410 (Miss. 2001). The Supreme Court also found that the allegations in the County's complaint stated a viable claim. The case was remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. The State's motion for a rehearing of the case was denied on February 21, 2002.</p>\r\n<p>On November 10, 2003, following a bench trial that was held from April 29, 2003, to May 6, 2003, the Circuit Court (Judge Ann H. Lamar) entered judgment in favor of the State. Judge Lamar concluded that \"Quitman County had not met its burden of proving that the funding mechanism established by statute had led to systemic ineffective assistance of counsel in Quitman County and throughout the state.\" The County appealed and, on July 21, 2005, the Supreme Court of Mississippi (Judge James W. Smith) affirmed the ruling of the Circuit Court. Quitman County v. State, 910 So.2d 1032, 1037 (Miss. 2005).</p>\r\n<p>Footnote 1 of State v. Quitman County, 807 So.2d 401, 402 (Miss. 2001), states that three similar suits were filed but held in abeyance pending the outcome of the first appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court in the Quitman County case. These other cases are in our database and appear as: <a href=\"../../../../case/10073/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jefferson County v. State</a>, <a href=\"../../../../case/10074/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Noxubee County v. State</a>, and <a href=\"../../../../case/10075/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Van Slyke v. State</a>. Because we have no docket or other court documents for Jefferson County v. State or Noxubee County v. State, we are unsure whether these cases were resumed following the Mississippi Supreme Court's authorization of a trial in the Quitman County case or whether they were otherwise resolved. The third case, Van Slyke v. State, was voluntarily dismissed in 2001 after the plaintiff resigned as public defender. Because we have no docket or other court documents in the Van Slyke case, we are unsure whether it was dismissed before or after the Mississippi Supreme Court's authorization of a trial in the Quitman County case.</p>\r\n<p>We have no further information on Quitman County v. State.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The statutes requiring each county to provide counsel for indigent\nI\ndefendants in non-capital cases are not in conflict with Art. 3, § 26 of the Mississippi\nConstitution of 1890. And further, the current legislative state, hampered with a general lack\nI\nof requested state funds, is clearly unable to undertake the process of funding a statewide\nI\nsystem of indigent defense.\n!\n-1-\n!\n\n!\ni\nARGUMENT\ng\nQuitman County seemingly misunderstands the relationship between the Legislature\ng\nand the individual counties. Each county is \"a subdivision of the state, created for\nadministration and other public purposes, and ... is subject at all times to legislative control\ng\nand change.\" State v. Board of Sup 'rs of Grenada County, 105 So. 541,546 (Miss. 1925)\nII\n(also describing counties as \"agencies of the state government\" that were \"created by the\nLegislature fbr political and civil purposes\"). The State of Mississippi, acting through its\n!\nLegislature, \"simply [has] creator power to control the county,\" including the control of funds\n!\nin the possession of counties. State v. Hinds Coun.tv Board of Sup 'rs, 635 So.2d 839, 843\nI (Miss. 1994). Any funds that belong to a county also belong to the state: \"The revenues of a\ncounty are subject to the control of the Legislature, and when the Legislature directs their\nI\napplication to a particular purpose or to the payment of the claims of particular parties, the\nI\nobligation to so pay is thereby imposed on the county.\" Jackson Coun.ty v. Neville, 95 So.\n626, 629 (Miss. 1932); see also Hinds County, 635 So.2d at 841,843.\nI\nQuitman County has no authority to support its assertion that the State is\nI\nconstitutionally prohibited from directing counties to assist in the provision indigent defense.\nHinds County, 635 So.2d at 843. Indeed, counties were in tact \"created by the Legislature\nI\nfor political and civil purposes as agencies of the state government.\" Grenada County, 105\nI\nSo. at 546 (emphasis supplied).\nMoreover, the State's \"creator's power\" extends to the control of funds in the\nI\nI\nI\n-2-\n\n!\n|\npossession of counties. _ \"The revenues of a county are subject to the control of the\ng\nLegislature, and when the Legislature directs their application to a particular purpose or to the\ng\npayment of the claims of particular parties, the obligation to so pay is thereby imposed on the\ncounty.\" Jackson County v. Neville, 95 So. 626, 629 (Miss. 1932). In Hinds County, the\nII\nboard of supervisors asserted that the State should bear the cost of housing State prisoners in\nI\ncounty facilities. Hinds County. 635 So.2d at 841. The Supreme Court, reiterating that \"the\nrevenues of a county are subject to the control of the Legislature,\" found no merit in the\nI\ncomplaint. 635 So.2d at 843. Importantly, the Hinds County court also rejected the claim\nI\nthat statutes which result in \"unequal tax burdens\" between counties are \"unconstitutional.\"\nId. at 845.\nI\nWith respect to indigent defense, the Legislature has decided to create statewide,\nI\nstate-ftmded offices to handle capital litigation, while requiring individual counties to\nI organize and pay for non-capital indigent defense in the manner that they think best. The\nimportance of local conlxol is emphasized in the Task Force report, which relied on a survey\nI\nof senior circuit court judges. Even if the burden affects the counties unequally, that fact\nI\nwould not be relevant to the legal analysis here. Hinds Count),, 635 So.2d at 845.\nQuitman County filed this lawsuit because it disagrees with the Legislature's\nI\nallocation of responsibilities. The County wants Mississippi courts to take the extraordinary\nI\nstep of issuing an injunction to the Legislature and ordering legislators to pass laws that\nI\n\"Constitutionally, budget-making is a legislative prerogative and responsibility in\nMississippi.\" Alexander v. State by and through Allain, 441 So.2d 1329, 1339\n[\n(Miss. 1983).\n-3-\n\nwould relievethecountiesofallfinancialburdensassociatedwith indigentdefenseinnon-\ncapitalcases.QuitmanCounty would rather spend revenue on.discretionary programs or\nlower its tax levy rate rather than abide by its statutory and constitutional duty to assist in\nfunding indigent defense.\nBecause this case is ultimately a dispute over the allocation of state fiscal\nresponsibilities, this Court's issuing an injunction to the Legislature would be contrary to\nprior decisions holding that the Legislature is the appropriate branch of government to deal\nwith the problem of indigent defense: \"While the legislature can view the full spectrum of the\nproblem, the courts do not have the means or facilities to adequately study the problem or\nprovide the remedy, can only deal with the problems on a case by case basis.\" Young v.\nState, 255 So.2d 318, 321-322 (Miss. 1971); see also Wilson v. State, 574 So.2d 1338, 1340\n(Miss. 1990). The trial court found insufficient evidence of widespread ineffectiveness in\nQuitman County specifically, and virtually no evidence of ineffectiveness throughout the\nState as a whole.\nEven if Quitman County had presented sufficient proof that its part-time pubic\ndefenders were not providing constitutionally adequate legal representation, it still would not\nfollow that a statewide injunction is an appropriate remedy. If Quitman County is not\nmeeting its obligations, then a court could have ordered the County to increase funding or\notherwise reform its system of providing indigent defense services. (For example, the\nCounty could be required io earmark the funds it receives in fines and forfeitures from the\nState for indigent defense.) This Court held in Hosford v. State, 525 So.2d 789, 798 (Miss.\n1988), that a court could issue such an injunction to the county, government in \"cases of\n4-\n\nabsolute necessity.\" In Hosford, a county courthouse was in such disrepair that it interfered\nwith the administration of justice, and the county was in such bad financial condition that it\nwas \"impossible for them to spend the money it would take to correct the situation.\" h/. at\n796, 797. Because the Legislature imposes the duty on individual counties to keep the\ncourthouses within its boundaries \"in good repair,\" the injunction was issued against the\ncounty government. Despite the county's poor financial condition, the Court did not seek to\nreapportion the financial burden between the State and counties for courthouses.\nMoreover, there is no reason to believe that a full-time, public defenders' office is the\nonly constitutionally permissible system of indigent defense. If the evidence had warranted\nit, and if Quitman County had requested it, the trial court could have issued a narrow\ninjunction to address specific flaws in the indigent defense system.\nIn addition to the discretion entrusted to the Legislature by the separation of powers\ndoctrine, Section 261 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 explicitly allows the State to\nrely on county funds for indigent defense, stating that \"expenses of criminal prosecutions\nshall be borne by the county in which such prosecution shall be begun; and all fines and\nforfeitures shall be paid into the treasury of such county.\" See BoardofSup 'rs of George\nCounty v. Bailey, 236 So.2d 420, 422 (Miss. 1970). As the Supreme Court has recognized in\nthe context of indigent defense,\nOne of the fundamental constitutional provisions is the division of\ngovernmental powers. The Mississippi Constitution specifically enjoins each\ndepartment from exercising the powers vested in either of the others. The\nauthority to empower payment of attorneys who are required by court order to\ndefend indigents., is a legislative matter or a judicial matter; it cannot be\nboth .... Sections I and 2 of our Constitution are clear on this point. The\nappropriation of public funds is traditionally within the exclusive province of\n°5_\n\nl\n|\nthe legislature. While the judiciary possesses the inherent power to appoint\ni\ncounsel to defend indigents, it does not follow that courts can order the\nexpenditure of public funds to pay their fees.\ni\nThe legislature is the appropriate branch of government to deal with this matter\n|\nbecause it can conduct hearings to determine the extent of the need, the amount of funds\nrequired, and the numerous related factors involved. While the legislature can view the full\n!\nspectrum of the problem, the courts do not have the means or facilities to adequately study\nII\nthe problem or provide the remedy, can only deal with the problems on a case by case basis.\nYoungv. State, 255 So.2d 318, 321-322 (Miss. 1971); see also Wilson, 574 So.2d at 1340.\ni\nThis is not the first instance in which a county has alleged \"financial ruin\" at the\ni\nhands of the Legislature and in each such instance courts have properly noted that the\nI judiciary, does not sit to second guess the spending priorities set by the Legislature for the\ncounties. See e.g., Hinds Count, 635 So.2d at 843 (not unconstitutional to require counties\ni\nto house State prisoners at cost to county); see also Mississippi Municipal Assoc. Inc. v.\nI State, 390 So.2d 986 (Miss. 1980) (refusing to review \"fairness\" of statute setting distribution\nof gasoline tax to various municipalities). As the Supreme Court noted in State ex rel.\nI\nPatterson v. Board of Sup \"rs of Prentiss County, even when the county alleges that a\ni\nfinancial obligation will\ndestroy local government in the counties and municipalities, that is a question\nI!\nto be settled at the ballot boxes between the people and the Legislature. And\nwhether the law is needed or not, or whether it is wise or not, cannot be settled\nhere. Our functions are to decide whether the Legislature has the power to act\ni\nin passing the law and not whether it ought to have acted in the manner it did.\nThe Court will uphold the Constitution in the tidiness of its protection, but it\nwill not and cannot rightfully control the discretion of the Legislature within\n!\nthe field assigned to it by the Constitution.\n|\n-6-\n\n105So.2d154,159-160(Miss. 1958).\nThe legislators who have exercised their lawfial authority to set the spending priorities\nof the counties are elected by and fi'om the taxpayers of all 82 counties and stand accountable\nto the taxpayers at the ballot box in regular elections. It is the electors and elected legislators\nwho determine the wisdom of statutes and set the relative tax burdens, not the judiciary,\nWhile the County has failed to present to this Court evidence regarding the financial situation\nof counties other than Quimaan County, the legislators elected from those counties are much\nmore informed as to the budget conditions of the counties and the State.\nIndeed, the Hosford v. State case, presents the same facts as the case at bar and sets\nforth the proper outcome of this matter. In Hosford, the county courthouse was found to be\nin such disrepair as to interfere with the administration of justice. 525 So.2d 789, 797 (Miss.\n1988). By statute, the Legislature requires counties to \"erect and keep in good repair\" the\ncourthouse, hi. The trial court even concluded that it was convinced of that due to the\nfinancial condition of the county \"it's impossible tbr them to spend the money it would take\nto correct the sittmtion.'\" ld. at 796. Rejecting the contention now advanced by Quitrnan\nCotmty, the Court did not seek to reapportion the financial burden between the State and\ncounties for courthouses. Instead, the a unanimous Supreme Court reached factual and legal\nconclusions fatal to Quitman County:\na. Counties are authorized by State law \"to levy taxes necessary to meet the\ndemands of their counties.\" Id. at 797.\nb, The Legislature has created \"a clear statutory duty of a board of supervisors\nto provide adequate court facilities\" ld.\n-7-\n\n!\ni\n!\nCo \"It follows, of course, that county board of supervisors, which have imposed\nupon them the statutory duty of furnishing adequate courtroom facilities, are\nsubject to appropriate court orders requiring them to do so when they\nH\nadamantly fail or refuse to do so.\" ld. at 798 (emphasis supplied).\n|\nAs Quitman County has not, and could not, prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it\nlacks the ability to raise revenue or trim discretionary spending in order to fulfill its statutory\n!\nand constitutional obligation to fund indigent defense, this Court is not free to rewrite the\n!\nstatutes or the Constitution and the County is subject to appropriate court orders if it \"fails or\n! refuses\" to fund indigent defense. For this Court to do otherwise would be to invite the\njudiciary to become a roving arbiter of\"financial burdens\" between the Legislature and its\n|\nagent the counties. As the former Chief Justice Pittman expressed, this would \"open the door\n| to a floodgate of lawsuits on many subject matters where a County Board of Supervisors\ndisagrees with state law ..... State-aid roads, law enforcement, and the like .... These\ni\nrequirements are imposed by state statute. Will we next be called on to judicially weigh their\ni\ndesirability or proper funding.\" Quitman County, 807 So.2d at 412 (Pittman, C.J.,\ndissenting). Indeed, as the financial conditions of individual counties change from year-to-\ni\nyear, there would be challenges .from separate counties seeking financial relief through\n|\napplication to the Courts regarding different statutes on an annual basis. The Legislature\nwhen considering new legislation could never be sure of the constitutionality of such\n|\nmeasures if the judiciary stood to second guess the relative financial burden on one county or\n|\nall counties in future years.\n| Finally, it is the confusion over the relief requested by Quitman County which\ng\n-8-\n\n_I,JI_IJLL.__IJJ LI' II IJIi I_ll_, olijl_ jIqLLjlJII.L!,_../111111 iln/lllUl,_lnli. HllllJ_L_J I_q_lJ_. Ei_,_,., j.:_,' ...... ..j__ i .. ,I._ ......\ni\nunderscores that such a role is not proper for the judiciary. The complaint seeks a declaration\ni\nthat a statewide, State-funded public defender program is mandated by the Constitution,\n!\nthereby relieving counties of any financial responsibility for indigent defense. At trial,\nQuitman County officials changed their request, stating that they would contribute the same\nl\namount to indigent defense, but desired an order whereby the County was required to pay no\ni\nmore than the current less than 1% of its budget. The County officials, now conceding there\nis a financial role to be played by counties, requests this Court to devise a county-by-county\ni\n\"cap,\" determining whether 1%, 3% or 5% of a county budget is proper for indigent defense\nI\nbut that a burden in excess of such is \"unconstitutional.\" Clearly, if the legislature has the\nconstitutional authority to require counties to spend any of its budget on indigent defense then\nil\nit is tbr the legislature to determine what the proper amount is.\na\nAnother important aspect in this matter is the fiscal state of the State. The State of\n| Mississippi's fiscal operations are normally classified into three groups: General Fund\nagencies, Special Fund agencies, and earmarked or diverted funds. A General Fund agency is\nI\nan3' department, institution, board, or commission of the State of Mississippi that is supported\nin whole or in part by appropriations fi'om the General Fund. A Special Fund agency is any\nagency, department, institution, board, or commission of the State of Mississippi that does\nnot receive an appropriation from the General Fund. A Special Fund agency is supported\nwholly by sources outside the General Fund. Earmarked or diverted funds are those that are\ncollected by the State but go directly to other entities usually by virtue of statutory direction.\nEarmarked or diverted funds include those that go directly to counties. State of Mississippi\nJoint Legislative Budget Report, FY 2005.\n-9-\n\n!\n!\nA statewide system of indigent defense would usually be funded in a manner that\n!\nderived fi'om one of the aforementioned methods. As will be demonstrated herein, it would\nH\nbe literally impossible to implement any new agency by virtue of using General Funds.\nFurther, creating Special Funds or earmarked or diverted funds would entail generating\ni\nadditional sources of revenue by raising taxes.\ng\nSo the question becomes, if a statewide system of indigent defense is created where\ndo the funds come from? There are two answers and neither are very palatable. One: take\n!\nthe money from someone else. Two: raise taxes.\nI!\nIt is common knowledge that raising taxes will be virtually impossible to accomplish\na in the near future. According to both the House and Senate Appropriation Committee\nChairmen there will not likely be a tax increase this year even though there is a budget\ng\ncrunch. According to Representative Johnny Stringer, \"[a]lthough the session likely won't\ni\ninvolve a tax increase,.., people might support one if they knew how much the budget must\nbe cut.\" The Clarion Ledger, November 28, 2004, Page IOA. Further, Senator Jack Gordon\nI\nsaid \"the Senate won't consider a tax increase.\" ld\nI\nIn addition to any Legislative desire Governor Haley Barbour has indicated that he\nwould veto any tax increase. The Sun Herald, November 28, 2004.\n!\nAnd as has been alluded to and will be discussed more, the State is facing a budgetary\nI\nsituation that must be considered difficult at best. The fact is that the State cannot even\ncontinue to pay for the current level of state employees.\nI\n\"If we can't come up with new revenue, we'll have to have a reduction in work\nI\nforce,\" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Jack Gordon. \"We'll have to cut\nI\n-10-\n\ni\n|\ndown numbers in work force to what an agency can afford.\" The Clarion Ledger, November\nI\n28, 2004, Page 1A. This sentiment is also confirmed by the House Appropriations\n|\nCommittee Chairman. Chairman Johnny Stringer said \"I think we're going to have to\neliminate some programs.\" \"We're probably going to have to agree (with the Senate) on\nli\nlaying people off.\" ld. Further, respected legislative leaders see additional methods to reduce\ng\nGeneral Fund appropriation for state employees. Former State Fiscal Officer and current\nRepresentative Cecil Brown has stated that he would \"hope to do a hiring freeze.\" ld.\ng\nMississippi is facing a budget shortfall of anywhere fi'om $600 million to $1 billion.\n|\nNew growth is only expected to generate an additional $135 million in funds that can be used\ni to cover any shortfalls. With a potential budget shortfall of 25% of the overall General Fund\nbudget of approximately $4 billion, any cuts of the extent required would have to be\nI!\ndraconian. The Sun Herald, November 28, 2004.\nI\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the assertions that the Legislature is not willing or\nable to deal with the matter of indigent defense are simply not accurate. As has been noted\nI\nby all parties to this appeal, the Legislature created two separate entities to absolve the\nI\ncounties of the cost of indigent defense of capital cases: the Office of Capital Defense\nCounsel and the Of-flee of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel 2. Both of these agencies are part\nI\nof the Judicary and Justice General Fund category for agency appropriation.\nI\nFor Fiscal Year 2005, the General Fund appropriation increased by approximately\n$140 million. However, this increase was driven by the $183 million increase in Public\nI\nAmici would show that both of these entities were created in the next legislative\nI\nsession after a legislative finding regarding the tremendous and unpredictable\ndrain that indigent defense in capital cases had on Mississippi counties resources.\ni\n-11-\n!\n\nI\nI\nEducation funding which had an overall increase in General Fund appropriation of 12.07%.\n|\nFY 2005 Appropriations comparison to FY 2004, Joint Legislative Budget Committee, State of\nli\nMississippi Budget, FY 2005, Compiled June 15, 2004.\nOf the nineteen (19) separate General Fund categories, ten (10) saw a decrease in\n|\nappropriation in Fiscal Year 2005. Seven (7) saw either no increase or an increase of less\nli\nthan 1.32 %. ld. Said another way nearly 90 % of all of the separate General Fund categories\nsaw either a reduction in appropriation or minuscule growth.\nH\nHowever, The Office of Capital Defense Counsel had a 12.67 % increase in\ni\nappropriation in Fiscal Year 2005. House Bill No. 1731, 2004 Regadar Session. The Office\ng of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel had a 6.0 % increase in appropriation in Fiscal Year 2005.\nHouse Bill No. 1732, 2004 Regular Session. The total Judiciary and Justice General Fund\ng\ncategory Fiscal Year 2005 appropriation showed an 8.36% increase. Page 6, FY 2005\ng Appropriations comparison to FY 2004, Joint Legislative Budget Committee, State of\nMississippi Budget, FY 200L Compiled June 15, 2004. This is critical evidence that the\ng\nLegislature is sensitive to the plight &the indigent in need of counsel. 3\nI\nWhat is particularly troubling is the insistence that under-funding is the culprit for\nperceived problems with indigent defense. Equating funding with effectiveness is not in line\n|\nwith modern legislative thinking. The creation of a statewide system of indigent defense does\n!\nnot address many of the concerns raised by the Appellants. And surely increased bureacracy is\nI\nOnly one bill was filed during the 2004 Regular Session dealing with the\nestablishment of a statewide system of indigent defense. The bill, House Bill\n1121, had only one author and died in Committee. When such is the fate of\n!\npotential legislation, the common indication is that no group, within or without\nthe legislative body, believes that the potential legislation currently has merit.\ni\n-12-\n\nnotnecessarilytheanswerto the problems identified. It is a well worn out notion that there is\na direct correlation between funding and results. No one can accurately predict that flail-time\nindigent defense counsel, with supposedly tmlimited access to resources, will be anymore\ndedicated than those that pertbrm that function now.\nMuch is made of the fact that the system currently employed by the State of\nMississippi, and over half of the State's, is that of a part-time Public Defender. Appellant's\nhave argued that part-time public defender shirks their duty as a public servant because of the\nallure of their private law practice. Such assertion is dumbfounding. This logic would assume\nthat all part-time public servants do a disservice to their constituents. To follow the reasoning\nof Appellants', then all Legislators and like part-time public servants 4, should become full-\ntime public servants.\nWhat Appellants actually do is make a broad-based indictment of the legal profession.\nAll the while, there has been no showing that there are vacancies or a lack of attorneys willing\nto be counsel for indigents on a part-time basis. There is no evidence that there has been a\nmass exodus of attorneys willing to represent indigent defendants.\nOne must assume that indigent counsel is paid based upon an arm's length transaction.\nIf the compensation for indigent defense counsel is inadequate one would expect a chronic\nshortage of attorneys willing to do the work. As has been said, their has been no indication to\nthe legislature that such is a problem. Amici will acknowledge incompetency in all\nprofessions, but cannot make the blind leap tying such incompetency to a lack of ftmding.\nEspecially those individuals that also happen to be members of the Mississippi\nBar and therefore face the same alluring scenarios as part-time indigent defense\ncounsel.\n-13-\n\nI\nI For the foregoing reasons, Amici respectfully request that this Honorable Court deny\nI\nI the relief sought by Appellants.\n!

These  representations  are  made  in  order  that  the judges  of \nthe  Court  of Appeals  may  evaluate possible  disqualification  or recusal. \n1,  Samuel  W.  Keyes,  Jr.,  Brian  W.  Sanderson,  and members  of the  law  firm  of Butler, \nSnow,  O’Mara,  Stevens  &  Cannada,  PLLC,  Post  Office  Box  22567,  Jackson,  MS  39225- \n2567,  attorneys  for The  Mississippi  Association  of Supervisors; \nThe Mississippi  Association  of Supervisors,  Mr.  Jack  Gregory,  Executive Director,  793 \nNorth  President Street,  Jackson,  MS  39201; \nil \n  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n  \nThe  Mississippi  Association  of Supervisors,  Inc.  (“MAS”)  submits  this  amicus  curiae \nbrief in  support  of Appellee,  Quitman  County,  Mississippi’s  (“Quitman  County’)  position.  MAS \nis  a  Statewide  organization  compnised  of supervisors  elected  from  all  82  Mississippi  counties  and \nmaintains  an active  interest  in  county  governments  and  the  citizens  which they  govern.  In \nworking  to  foster better  government  for  all  Mississippi  counties,  MAS  serves  as  a  liaison \nbetween  the  counties  and  the  State  government,  particularly  the  Mississippi  Legislature.  It  is \nthrough  this  role  that  MAS  has  a keen  appreciation  for  the  issues posed  to  the  Legislature  and \nthis  Court  in  ensuring  that  adequate,  effective  assistance  of counsel  as  required  by  the  United \nStates  and  Mississippi  constitutions  is received by  every  indigent  defendant  in  criminal \nproceedings. \nMAS  is  sensitive  to  the  serious  financial  constraints  facing  our  State  and  appreciates  the \nefforts  made  by  the  State’s  legislative  and  executive  branches  to  limit  financial  burdens placed \nupon  county governments.  MAS  is  aware  that  a  solution  to  such  a  difficult  issue  is  not  arrived  at \neasily  but  only  after  careful  consideration  of the  parties’  interests,  the historical  and  current  facts, \nand,  most  importantly,  the  constitutional  requirements  with which  the  State  is  charged.  In \nsubmitting  this  brief,  MAS  hopes  to  advance  the  decision-making  process  in  which  this  Court  is \nengaged.  All  82  county  members  of MAS  will  be  directly  impacted  by  this  Court’s  ruling  and, \ntherefore,  MAS  seeks  to  ensure  that  this  Court  is  aware  of all  relevant  facts  and  law. \nARGUMENT \nA.  Counties  have  standing  to  sue  the  State when  alleging  constitutional  violations. \n  \nA  county’s  board  of supervisors  is  authorized  to  bring  suit  regarding matters  which  affect \nthe  county’s  interests,  and  the board  of supervisors  is  the  proper  entity  to  decide  whether  the \n   \ncounty’s  interests  are  affected.  Harrison  County  v.  City  of Gulfport,  557  So.  2d  780,  785  (Miss. \n1990).  The judiciary  may  not  intervene  in  a  county’s  decision  to  protect  its  interests  unless  “the \nassertion  is  seen  as  a  sham.”  Harrison  County,  557  So.  2d  at  785.  Quitman  County  clearly  has \nstanding  to  bring  this  suit  on behalf of its  citizens  as  “the  interest  of the  county  is  derived  from \nthe  interest  of the  citizens  of the  county  ....  The  board  of supervisors  is  the  governmental \nauthority  closest  to  those  people  and  is  surely  charged  to protect  their  welfare.”  Id.  at  783.  The \nState  argues  that  Quitman  County  has  no  standing  to  assert  constitutional  challenges  on  behalf of \ndefendants  in  criminal  suits,  but  does not  contend  that  the  County  ts  without  authority  to  initiate \nlegal  action  on  behalf of its  taxpayers.'  Such  a position  would  be  without  legal  support. \nA  county  is  specifically  authorized  by  statutes  to  bring  suit  in  its  name  “where  there  is  a \npublic  night...  to  be  vindicated”  and  even  if “only  a part  of the  county  or  .  .  .  its  inhabitants  are \nconcerned  ....”  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §11-45-19  (1972);  see also,  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  11-45-17 \n(authorizing  counties  to  sue  and  be  sued).  Under Mississtppi’s  standing  rules,  parties  may  sue  or \nintervene  when  either (1)  “they  assert  a colorable  interest  in  the  subject  matter  of the  litigation,” \n(2)  “experience  an  adverse  effect  from  the  conduct  of the  defendant,”  or “otherwise  authorized  by \nlaw.”  Harrison  County,  557  So.  2d  at  782. \nIn  Harrison  County v.  City  of Gulfport,  Harrison  County  opposed  the judicial \nconfirmation  of separate  annexations by  the  cities  of Gulfport  and  Biloxi,  and  the  cities \n  \n\"  The  State  cites  federal  cases  in  support  of its  proposition but  this  Court  has  noted  that \nfederal  standing  requirements  are more  stringent  than  their state  counterparts  due  in  part  to  the \n“case  or  controversy”  provision  of Art.  III,  §  2  of the  United  States  Constitution.  Harrison \nCounty,  557  So.  2d  at  782  n.1.  The  Mississippi  Constitution has  no  “case  or  controversy”’clause. \nId. \n   \nchallenged  the  county’s  standing  to  assert  such  opposition.?  557  So.  2d  at  781.  On  hearing  the \ninterlocutory  appeal,  this  Court  found  that  the  county  would  “experience  a  legally  cognizable \neffect”  from  the  annexations  and  that the  standing  requisites  were  “easily  satisfied.”  Id.  at  783. \nFurthermore,  this  Court  found that the board  of supervisors  were  authorized by  law  to  file  suit  in \nthe  county’s  name.  Id,  at  785.  Section  11-45-17,  Miss.  Code  Ann.  provides  general  authority  of \na  county  to  sue  and  be  sued  and  expressly  provides  that  suits  by  the  county  must  be  brought  by \nthe  authority  of the  board  of supervisors.  Id.  Implicit  to  §  11-45-17  and  expressly  authorized  by \nMiss.  Code  Ann.  §  19-3-47(1)(b)  is  the  county’s  power to  hire  legal  counsel  in  its  representation. \nId.  The  county’s  authority  to  sue  is  supplemented  by  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  11-45-19:  “Suit  may  be \nbrought,  in  the  name  of the  county,  where  only  a part  of the  county  or of its  inhabitants  are \nconcerned,  and  where  there  is  a public  right  of such part  to  be  vindicated.”  Id.  This  Court  found \nno  surprise  in  such  legislative pronouncements  as  the  “supervisors  of each  county  in  this  state  are \ncharged  generally  to  promote  the peace,  happiness,  and  economic  and  social  welfare  of the \npeople they  serve.”  Id, (emphasis  added). \nThere  can  be  no  disagreement  that  the  State’s  failure  to  provide  effective  assistance  of \ncounsel  to  indigent  criminal  defendants  has  created  an  adverse  effect  on counties.  In  fact,  this \nCourt  previously  has  commented  on  the  inordinate  economic  burdens  placed  on  counties.  In \nWilson  vy.  State,  this  Court  encouraged  the  Legislature  “to  review  the  system  and provide  funds \nfor  the  representation  of indigent  defendants  in  capital  cases  from  State  funds  rather  than  county \n  \n?  A  resolution  adopted  by  the Harrison County Board of Supervisors  argued  that  the \nproposed  annexations would  be  ‘““inimical  to  the best  interests  and  general  welfare  of the  people \nof Harrison  County’”  and that  “Harrison County’s  tax  base  and its  school  system  would  suffer \nirreparable  damage  due  to  loss  of taxpayers  and  students,  etc.””  Harrison  County,  557  So.  2d  at \n783. \n  \n \nfunds.”  574  So.  2d  1338,  1341  (1990).  Again,  tn  Mease v.  State,  a  majority  of the  Court joined \nJustice  Prather’s  separate  opinion  which  concluded  that “the  Legislature  [should]  address  the \nproblem  of indigent  representation on  a  statewide  basis,  rather  that  thrust the  burden  on \nfinancially-strapped  counties.”  583  So.  2d  1283,  1285  (1991).  The  unfunded mandate  from the \nlegislature  has  taxed  a  burden  upon  the  counties  which  they  are  neither financially  capable  of \ncarrying  nor  legally  required  to  undertake.  The  resulting adverse  effects  give  the  counties \nstanding  to  bring the  current  lawsuit. \nThe  county  also  enjoys  special  standing  deference  when  the  State’s  constitutional \nviolations  affects  the  county’s  rights  and  the  interests  of its  citizens.  This  Court’s  opinion  in \nState  v.  Mississippi  Ass’n  of Supervisors,  Inc.,  illustrates  that  a county  has  standing  to  sue  on \nbehalf of its  citizens  when  the  State’s  constitutional  violations  adversely  impacts  the  county.  699 \nSo.  2d  1221  (Miss.  1997).  In  Mississippi  Ass’n  of Supervisors,  a  bill  was  enacted  which  allowed \nhaulers  of dirt  and  agricultural  and  forestry products  to  apply  to  the  Mississippi  Transportation \nCommission  for harvest permits  and  travel  on  non-federal  highways  within  the  state  at  a \nmaximum weight  of 84,000  pounds.  Mississippi  Ass’n of Supervisors,  699  So.  2d  at  1222. \nMAS,  Hinds  County  and  Washington  County  sought  a  declaratory  action  against  the  State \ncontending that  the bill  violated  Art.  6,  §  170  of the Mississippi  Constitution.?  The Hinds \nCounty  Circuit  Court  granted  plaintiffs’  motion  for  summary judgment  and  found  that  the  bill \n“inappropriately transferred  power  from  the  Board  of Supervisors  to  the  Mississippi \nTransportation  Commission.”  Id. \n  \n*  Article  6,  §  170,  Miss.  Const.  provides  in  pertinent  part:  “The  board  of supervisors  shall \nhave  full jurisdiction  over roads,  ferries,  and  bridges,  to  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  such \nregulations  as  the  legislature  may  prescribe...  .” \n  \n \nConsidering  the  matter  on  appeal,  this  Court  concluded  that  “the  legislature  may  regulate \nthe  boards  of supervisors  in  their  exercise  of their discretion,  so  Jong  as  it  does  not  remove  that \ndiscretion  in  any  way.”  Id.  at  1224.  Legislation  removing  such  discretion  would  go  against  both \nthe  constitution  and  common  sense.  Id.  Affirming  the  trial  court’s  decision,  this  Court held that \nthe  bill  under review  left  the  county  with no  discretion  other than  to  “repair the  road  once  it  has \nbeen  damaged  by  weights  exceeding  its  design  capacity.”  Id. \nAs  it  should  be  in  the  present  case,  the  standing of the  counties  was  clear to  the  State  in \nMississippi  Ass’n  of Supervisors  and  not  challenged.  The  holding  supports Quitman  County’s \nauthority  to  sue  the  State  for  the  financial  onus  passed to  the  county via  the  State’s  constitutional \nviolations.  Just  as  the  counties  in  Mississippi  Ass’n  of Supervisors  would  have been  charged \nwith  the  expense  of repairing  its  roads  for the  Legislature’s  constitutional  violations,  the  counties \nin the  case  sub judice  are  being  taxed  with  the  heavy  costs  of indigent  defense  for  the \nLegislature’s  more  serious  violations  of failing  to  provide  constitutionally  required  effective \nassistance  of counsel.  In Mississippi  Ass’n  of Supervisors,  this  Court  explained  that  if the \ncounty’s  discretion  “is  removed  in  any  way,  then  the  legislature  could  logically  continue  to \nremove  the powers  of the  county one  at  a  time  until  any  remaining jurisdiction  would  be  only \nnominal.”  Mississippi  Ass’n  of Supervisors,  699  So.  2d  at  1224.  Similar reasoning  is  applicable \nhere  in  that  if the  State  can  pass  the  cost  of indigent  defense  with  which  it  is  constitutionally \ncharged,  then  it  may  continue  to pass  less  important  funding  responsibilities  to  the  counties  until \nthe  their treasuries  are  virtually  depleted. \nIn  its  Brief before  this  Court,  the  State  argues  that  Art.  3,  §  26,  Miss.  Const.  provides \nrights  exclusively  to  criminal  defendants  and  not  counties,  and,  therefore,  Quitman  County has \n  \n \nno  standing  to  bring  suit.  Even  if Art.  3,  §  26  is  not  a  source  of rights  for  the  counties,  however, \nit  is  a  source  responsibility.  Specifically,  it  is  a  source  of responsibility  incumbent  upon  the  State \nwhich  the  State  has  deferred  to  the  counties.  Certainly,  a county  has  standing  to  seek redress  if it \ncannot  afford  to  uphold  duties  thrust  upon  it  by  the  State.  The  business  world  provides  an \nexample  of how  a person  may  have  standing  to  sue where  it  cannot  afford  to  supply  the \nprotections  guaranteed  for the  benefit  of another.  For  example,  where  a  contractor  is  building  a \npublic  housing  project which  must meet  certain  governmental  specifications  and  then passes \nthose  obligations  on  to  a  subcontractor who  cannot  meet  them  for the  agreed  price,  certainly  the \nsubcontractor  may  sue  the  contractor.  The  specifications  are  for  the  benefit  of the  tenants,  not \nthe  contractor  or  subcontractor.  Nonetheless,  the  contractor would  maintain  standing  to  sue  for \nthe  illegal  transfer of obligations  incumbent  upon  the  contractor.  Similarly,  a  county  burdened \nwith the  State’s  duty to  provide  effective  assistance  of counsel  may  seek redress  where  it  cannot \nsustain  such  a burden. \nThe  boards  of supervisors  of the  various  counties  are  constitutionally  created  and  should \nnot be  forced  to  take  on  obligations  properly charged  to  the  State.  A  county  is  a  separate \ngovernmental  entity  charged  with  the  protection  and  welfare  of its  citizens.  It  is  not  a  mere  local \npuppet  subject  exclusively  to  legislative  delegation,  particularly  with  regard  to  those  duties \nconstitutionally  charged  to  the  State.  Without  access  to  the  courts,  Quitman  County would have \nno  forum  in  which  to  seek redress  of the  Legislature’s  unfunded  mandate.  The  economic  and \nsocial  interests  of the  citizens  of Quitman  County  have  been  adversely  impacted  and  their \nsupervisors  therefore  have  standing  to  seek judicial  relief. \nB.  Mississippi  counties  cannot  sustain  the terrible  financial  burden  of \neffective  assistance  of counsel  to  indigent  defendants \n6 \n  \n \nIt  is  beyond  dispute  that  indigent  defendants  in  criminal  actions  are  guaranteed  the \nfundamental  right  to  effective  assistance  of counsel  under  both  the  United  States  and  Mississippi \nconstitutions.  6th  Amend.,  U.S.  Const;  Art.  3,  §  26,  Miss.  Const.;’  Triplett  v.  State,  666  So.  2d \n1356,  1358  (Miss.  1995)  (concluding  that  Mississippi  Constitution  encompasses  all  rights  to \ncounsel]  as  provided  in  federal  constitution).  Furthermore,  case  law  is  unequivocal  that  the \nobligation  to  provide  effective  assistance  of counsel  in  criminal  proceedings  under the  Sixth \nAmendment  is  incumbent  upon the  State  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.’  Gideon  v. \nWainwright,  372  U.S.  335,  341-42  (1963);  Triplett,  666  So,  2d  at  1357.  The  question  posed  to \nthis  Court  in  the  case sub judice,  however,  is  whether  the  State  may  delegate  its  constitutional \nduty  to  financially  strapped  counties. \nMississippi  counties  are  ill-prepared  and  financially  unable  to  provide  adequate  funding \nfor  effective  legal  counsel  to  indigent defendants  in  criminal  proceedings.  County  treasuries \nacross  Mississippi  are limited  and  inadequate  to  pay  for  significant  expenditutes  which  would be \nrequired  to  compensate  lawyers  for providing  representation  to  indigent,  criminal  defendants. \n  \n*  “Fn  all  criminal  prosecutions  the  accused  shall  have a  right  to  be heard  by  himself or \ncounsel,  or both...  .”  Art.  3,  §  26,  Miss.  Const. \n*  In  Gideon,  the United  States  Supreme  Court held: \n  \n[R]leason  and  reflection require  us  to  recognize  that in our \nadversary  system  of criminal justice,  any person  haled  into  court, \nwho  is  too  poor  to  hire  a  lawyer,  cannot  be  assured  a  fair  trial \nunless  counsel  is  provided  for him.  This  seems  to  be  an  obvious \ntruth....  The  nght  of one  charged  with  crime  to  counsel  may  not \nbe  deemed  fundamental  and  essential  to  fair  trials  in  some \ncountries,  but it  is  in  ours.” \n372  U.S.  335,  346  (1963). \n  \n \nEffective  assistance  of counsel  is  not necessarily  limited  to  fees  incurred  by  defense  counsel  but \nalso  expert  witness  assistance  and  investigation  costs.  Jackson  v.  State,  732  So.  2d  187,  188-189 \n(Miss.  1999).  The  payment  of these  expenses  and  fees  would  only be possible  at  the  significant \nsacrifice  of county resources  devoted to  other  areas  for  which the  county  1s  responsible  such  as \neducation,  public  safety,  and  public  works.  As  this  Court  is  aware,  these traditional  obligations \nof the  county  are  currently  under tremendous  budgetary  constraints  without  the  added  financial \npressure  of paying  for  the  legal  representation  of indigent  defendants.  The  unfunded  mandate \nthrough which the  State  is  attempting  to  transfer  its  constitutional  duties  would  literally  break  the \ncoffers  of many  Mississippi  counties. \nAn  even  more  devastating,  but  perhaps  more realistic,  result  of the unfunded  mandate \nwould  be  that  legal  counsel  provided  by the  county would  not  be  effective.  See Triplett,  666  So. \n2d  at  1357  (finding  that  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  counsel  means  “the  right  to  effective \nassistance  of counsel’’)  (quoting  McMann  v.  Richardson,  397  U.S.  759,  771  n.  14  (1970)).  If the \ncounty  is  forced  to  provide  legal  representation  in  the  face  of existing  financial  trouble,  it \nlogically would  seek  the  least  expensive  counsel  while  hoping  that  it  is  effective  under Gideon \nand  its progeny.  Furthermore,  the  right  to  effective  assistance  of counsel  is  more  vulnerable \nwhen  the burden  of providing  it  is  passed  to  82  separate  county  governments,  instead  of being \nfunded  and  administered by  the  State.  See,  e.g.,  State  Tax  Comm’n  v.  Fondren,  387  So.  2d  712, \n719-20  (Miss.  1980)  (requiring  State  Tax  Commission  to  equalize  assessments  of ad  valorem \ntaxes  among  counties  where  practically  each  county  maintained  differing  standards  of \nassessment).  As  there  would  be no  uniformity  in  providing  defense  counsel  to  criminally \naccused  indigents,  the  inherent  constitutional  tightrope  created by  the  unfunded mandate  virtually \n  \n \nensures  that  their rights  would  be  violated.  The  State’s  attempted  delegation  of its  constitutional \nobligation  would  defeat  the  very purpose which  it purports  to  obtain,  ie.,  securing  the  right  of \neffective  assistance  of counsel  to  every  indigent  defendant  in  criminal  proceedings. \nIn  addition  to  individual  constitutional  rights being  violated,  the  overwhelming  cost  to  the \ncounty  would be  compounded  when  the  aggrieved  defendant  sued  for the  violations.  Of course, \nif the  county  refused  to  provide  any  legal  counsel  to  the  indigent  defendant,  it  would  be  sued  and \nfound  lable.  Most  counties,  however,  would  attempt  to provide  legal  representation  at  the \nlowest  price,  while  hoping  that  counsel  is  effective.  This  likely  scenario,  however,  gives  rise  to \neven  greater  dire  straights  as  indigent  defendants  would  charge  the  county  with  failure  to  provide \neffective  assistance  of counsel.  Consequently,  counties  would  be burdened  with  the attendant \nexpense  of defending  itself in  lawsuits  brought  by  aggrieved  criminal  defendants.  At  the  end  of \nthe  day,  the  State’s  failure  to  uphold  its  duties  with  which  it  is  constitutionally  charged  would \nresult  in  two  miscarriages  of justice:  (1)  the right  of the  criminally  accused to  effective  assistance \nof counsel  would  be  violated  and  (2)  county  funds  used  to  provide  for  the  well-being  of its \ntaxpayers  would  be  depleted  after the  county  attempted  to  provide  effective  counsel  and  then \nsued  for  failure  to  do  so. \nCONCLUSION \nThe  State  of Mississippi  is  required  to  provide  effective  assistance  of counsel  to  indigent \ndefendants  in  criminal  proceedings  and  stands  in better  financial  condition  to  execute  its \nconstitutional  charge.  Counties  are  not  able  to  bear  the  financial  burden  nor  to  uniformly  apply \nthe  State’s  constitutional  obligation.  Accordingly,  the  Mississippi  Association  of Supervisors, \nInc.  respectfully  requests  this  Court  to  affirm the  decision of the  Circuit  Court  for  Quitman \n  \n \nCounty,  Mississippi. \nRESPECTFULLY  SUBMITTED,  this  the  4J% day  of April,  2001. \nMISSISSIPPI  ASSOCIATION  OF  SUPERVISORS,  INC. \namuel  W.

This  followed  a  statement  made  the  previous \nyear by  the  Court,  in  the  context of a  death penalty  case,  to  the  effect that  the  State  should \nfund  the  indigent  function just  as  it  does  the  prosecution  function.  “[W]e  would \nencourage  the  Legislature  to  review  the  system  and  provide  funds  for  the representation \nof indigent  defendants  in  capital  cases  from  State  funds  rather  than  county  funds.  Since \nthe  State  funds  the prosecution  in these  cases,  why not  the  defense?”  Wilson  v.  State,  574 \nSo.  2d  1338,  1341  (Miss.  1990).  As  this  Court  has  recognized,  counties  cannot  afford  to \npay  for  indigent  defense  and  most  counties  also  lack  the  expertise  to  create  a  viable \nprogram.  While  the  State  funds  a  statewide  system  of full-time  prosecutors,  the  system \nof indigent  defense  is  a patchwork with  each  county  operating  on  its  own,  resulting  in  a \nchaotic  state  of affairs  that  leads  to  delays,  inefficiencies,  waste  of taxpayer  dollars,  and \nan  adversarial  process  that  varies  by  county  and  simply  does  not  work  as  it  should. \nNow,  over  a  decade  later,  the  reform  that  this  Court prescribed  for  a broken \nsystem  still  has  not been  implemented.  Although  the  promise  of reform  was  made with \nthe passage  of the  Mississippi  Statewide Public  Defender  System  Act  of  1998,  the \nlegislature  in  both  1998  and  1999  declined  to  create  or  fund  any public  defender  offices, \nmuch  less  begin  implementing  the  program  set  out  in  the  Act.  Quitman  County,  which \npatiently  had  waited  since  this  Court’s  pronouncements  in Mease  and  Wilson,  and had\nassumed  since  passage  of the  1998  Act  that  the  State  would  fulfill  the  legislature’s \npromise,  finally  turned to  the  Court  system.  It  filed  this  action  in December  of  1999, \ncontending  that  it  can no  longer  afford  to  operate  the  system  of indigent  defense,  and \ncertainly  cannot  afford  to  do  it  in  a proper  and  constitutional  manner.  But  rather  than \naccepting  the  obligation  of providing  for  indigent  defense,  the  State  has  aggressively \nfought  Quitman  County  at  every juncture.  With  the  trial  in  this  case  rapidly  approaching, \nthe  Attorney  General  moved to  dismiss,  claiming  that the  question  of indigent  defense  is \nthe  exclusive  province  of the  legislature  and  is  not  the  business  of the  courts.  After  the \nmotion to  dismiss  was  denied by  the  Circuit  Court,  the  State  took  this  interlocutory \nappeal. \nSTATEOFM THEE NISSTUE S \nUnder  the  lenient  standard  of Rule  12(b)(6),  Miss.  R.  Civ.  P.,  must  the  Courts  sit \nidly  by  when  the  State  has  failed  to  provide  a  constitutionally  adequate  indigent  defense \nprogram  and  the  Legislature  has  refused  to  address  the  problem? \nUnder  the  lenient  standard  of Rule  12(b)(6),  Miss.  R.  Civ.  P.,  must  the  Courts \nrefrain  from  even  considering  the  claim  of a  county  that  it  cannot  afford  to  provide  for  a \nconstitutionally  adequate program  of indigent  defense,  or  may  the  county present  its \nclarm  and  prove  its  contentions  at a  trial? \n   \nSTANDOFA RREVIDEW  \nA motion to  dismiss  under Rule  12(b)(6)  of the  Mississippi  Rules  of Civil \nProcedure  raises  an  issue  of law,  which  is  reviewed  de  novo.  Lowe  v.  Lowndes  County \nBidg.  Inspection  Dep’t.,  760  So.  2d  711,  712  (Miss.  2000);  Tucker  v.  Hinds  County,  558 \nSo.  2d  869,  872  (Miss.  1990).  This  Court must  take  the  well-pleaded  allegations  in the \ncomplaint  as  true when  reviewing  the trial  court’s  decision  on  a  motion  to  dismiss.  Mike \nMoore,  ex  rel.  v.  Byars,  757  So.  2d  243,  246  (Miss.  2000);  Butler  v.  Board of Supervisors \nfor Hinds  County,  659  So.  2d  578,  581  (Miss.  1995).  The  motion  should  not  be  granted \nunless  it  appears beyond  any  reasonable  doubt  that  the  plaintiff can prove  no  set  of facts \nin support  of its  claim  which would  entitle  it to  relief.  Moore,  ex  rel.,  757  So.  2d  at  246, \nButler,  659  So,  2d  at  581.  In  sum,  “there  must  appear to  a  certainty  that  the plaintiff is \nentitled  to no  relief under  any  set  of facts  that  could  be  proved  in  support  of the  claim.” \nWeeks  v.  Thomas,  662  So.  2d  581,  585  (Miss.  1995);  Franklin  County  Coop.  v.  MFC \nServs.  (A.A.L.),  441  So.  2d  1376,  1377  (Miss.  1983). \nSTATEOMF ETHEN CTAS E \nAlthough  the  State  of Mississippi  has  created  and  funded  a  system  by  which  full- \ntime  District  Attorneys  and  Assistant  District  Attorneys  prosecute  violations  of \nMississippi’s  criminal  code,  it  has  done  little  to  structure  or  fund  public  defender  offices \nin the  State.  Instead,  it  has  required  the  individual  counties  to  shoulder  the  burden.  Only \nthree  of the  State’s  82  counties  have  created  full-time  public  defender offices  to  handle \nthe  indigent  caseload.  The  other  79,  ill-equipped  to  undertake  this  vital  constitutional \nfunction,  rely  on  a patchwork  of systems.  Many counties  utilize  part-time  public \ndefenders  who  are  paid  a  relatively  low  salary —  sometimes  barely  above  the  minimum \n \nwage  — and  who  must  build  separate private  practices  that  compete  with  the  time  needed \nto  represent  their  appointed  indigent  clients.  Other  counties  rely  on  case-by-case \nappointments,  resulting  in  laborious judicial  administration  of indigent  defense.  Paying \nfor  any  indigent  defense  system  is  an  expense  that  few  counties  in  the  State  can  afford, \nindeed, Plaintiff Quitman  County  had  to  raise  taxes  three  times  during  the  1990s  and  take \nout  a large bank  loan  to  pay  for the  defense  costs  for  two  individuals.  And  while  few \ncounties  can  afford  to  pay  for  any  system  at  all,  almost  no  counties  have  the  resources  to \nprovide  a  constitutionally  adequate  indigent  defense  system. \nFor  several  years  after this  Court  in Mease  and  Wilson  called  upon  the  State  to \nbegin  funding  a  statewide  system of indigent  defense,  a number of bills  were  introduced \nin  the  legislature to  accomplish  this.  Finally,  after  years  of study  and  consideration,  the \nMississippi  Statewide  Public Defender  System  Act  of  1998  was  enacted.  This  Act \nincluded  specific  findings by  the  legislature  that  the  existing  county-based  system  does \nnot  protect  the  State’s  “defense  interest”  of “guaranteeing  to  each  accused  person  the \neffective  assistance  of competent,  loyal,  and independent  counsel,”  (Miss.  Code  Ann. \n§§  25-32-33(1)(c),  (2));  does  not  serve  the  State’s  “justice  interest’  of “administration  of \nits  criminal justice  system,  so  as  to  secure  the just,  fair,  speedy,  and  efficient  adjustment \nand  final  adjudication  of each  charge  formally  made,  to  protect  the  innocent,  and  to \npunish offenders,”  (id.  §§  25-32-33(1}(d),  (3));  and  does  not  secure  the  State’s \n“budgetary  interest”  in  “holding the  cost  of administration of its  criminal justice  system \nto  its  optimal  level.”  (Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  25-32-33(1)(f),  (3)).  The  Act  authorized  the \ncreation of a mandatory  statewide,  state-funded  public  defender  system,  and  a  public \ncommission to  make  recommendations  regarding  some  of the  particulars  of the  new \n   \nsystem.  Rather  than  fund  the  system  in  1998,  the  legislature  directed  the  Commission  to \nrecommend  an  implementation plan. \nThe  Public Defender  Commission  conducted  an  exhaustive review  of the  criminal \njustice  process  in  Mississippi  and  released  the  requested Implementation  Plan  on \nDecember  31,  1998.  In  it,  the  Commission noted  that Mississippi  is  one  of the  few  states \nin  the  country  that  does  not provide  any  state  funds  for  indigent  defense  services,  that  the \ntotal  amount  of money  expended  for  indigent  defense  in  Mississippi  (measured  on both  a \nper  capita  and  a per  case basis)  is  near the bottom  of the  nation,  and  that  the  county-based \nresources  are  not  sufficient  to  provide  adequate  representation,  particularly in  those \ncounties  using  the part-time  contract  public  defender  system.  The  Commission \nrecommended the  gradual  phase-in  of a new  system with  initial  funding  for  an  office  to \nhandle  indigent  appeals  and  for  a  pilot project of full-time  public  defender  offices  in  three \njudicial  districts. \nDespite  receiving  the  report  and  recommendation  it  requested —  containing  a \nmodest  phase-in proposal — the  legislature  took no  action  in  1999  and  declined to  fund \nany  public  defender  offices.  Quitman  County,  which had repeatedly raised  taxes  and  had \nbeen  waiting  for the  legislature  to  undertake  this  responsibility  ever  since  the  decisions  in \nMease  and  Wilson,  assumed with  passage  of the  1998  Act that  relief was  on  the  way.  But \nafter the  legislature  refused  to  fund  the  Act  in  1999,  Quitman  County  decided  it  could \nwait  no  longer.  This  case  was  filed  in  December  of 1999.  Jefferson  and  Noxubee \nCounties  filed  similar  cases  against  the  State,  and  the part-time  public  defender  in Forrest \nCounty  filed  a  suit  against  the  State  and  the  Forrest  County  Board  of Supervisors \nclaiming  that his  office  could not  render  constitutionally  effective  assistance  in  light  of\nthe  current  structure  and  funding  of the  system.  Those  three  cases  have been  held  in \nabeyance pending  the  outcome  of this  appeal. \nAfter  these  cases  were  filed,  legislation  was passed  during  the  2000  session  to \ncreate  an  office of capital  post-conviction  counsel  to  represent  death  row  prisoners  in \npost-conviction  proceedings.  In  addition,  a  death  penalty  trial  office  was  created  to  assist \nlocal  appointed  attorneys  in  death penalty  cases.  However,  the  portions  of the  legislation \ncreating  the  trial  office  never  have  been  implemented  and  the  office  never  has  been \noperational.  If it  ever  does  open,  it  may provide  some  relief to  counties,  but  the  office  is \ndesigned  only  to  assist  counsel  who  are  appointed  locally.  Counties  will  remain \nobligated  to  pay  for  the  local  attorneys  and  to  absorb  a  substantial portion  of the  defense \ncosts  in  death penalty  cases. \nMoreover,  death  penalty  prosecutions,  while  the  most  serious  cases,  are  only  a \nsmall  percentage  of the  indigent  felony  docket  in Mississippi.  Unfortunately,  while \npassing  this  legislation,  which  will  only  affect  some  portions  of some  death penalty  cases, \nthe  legislature  repealed  the  1998  Public  Defender  System  Act.  Thus,  while  making  a \npartial  effort  at  addressing  death  penalty problems  that  are  only  the  tip  of the  indigent \ndefense  iceberg,  the  State has  abandoned  all pretense  of doing  anything  else  to  fix  the \nproblem.  In  the  recently  completed 2001  session,  the  legislature  did nothing  to  address \nthe  lingering  question  of indigent  defense. \n  \n'  Notably,  only  a handful  of states  fail  to  provide  state  funding  for  the  indigent  defense \nsystem.  One  of those,  Texas,  recently  announced  plans  to  implement  a  system  of State \nfunding  to  move  toward  a  statewide public  defender  system.  “Texas  Nears  Creation  of \nState  Public-Defender  System,” N.Y.  Times,  April  6,  2001,  at A12  (National  Edition).  In \nFootnote  continued  on  next page \n \nThus,  Quitman  County  has  had  no  choice but  to  go  forward with  this  lawsuit.  The \nultimate  obligation  of indigent  defense —  which  is  constitutionally mandated  — belongs  to \nthe  State  and  cannot  be  shifted  to  the  counties.  Moreover,  even  if the  State  in  the  abstract \nhas  the  power to  ask  the  counties  to  pay  the  bill,  the  proof at  trial  will  show  that  Quitman \nCounty,  like  many  other  counties,  cannot perform  this job  in  a  constitutional  manner.  As \nthe  evidence will  demonstrate,  this  results  in  an  inadequate  and  unconstitutional  system \nof indigent  defense  and  has  devastating  consequences  for the  county’s  budget,  for the \ntaxpayers,  for government  officials  struggling  to  do  their jobs,  for  the  criminal justice \nsystem,  and  for  the  indigent  defendants  themselves.  Accordingly,  the  State,  upon  which \nthe  constitutional  obligation  for the  effective  assistance  of counsel  is  imposed  in  the  first \ninstance,  should be  held  accountable  to  devise  and  implement  a  solution  to  the  problem. \nThe  complaint  filed  in  the  case  specifically  alleges  that  the  State,  through  its \nfailure  to  provide  and  fund  an  indigent  defense  system,  has  imposed  enormous  and \nunpredictable  indigent  defense  costs  on  Quitman  County  and  its  taxpayers.  As  a result, \nfinancial  resources  available  to  fund  schools,  hospitals,  local  law  enforcement  and the \ntraditional  health,  safety  and  welfare  obligations  of county  government have been \nsubstantially reduced.  Complaint §  22(a)  (ARE  13).  This  increases  tax  burdens  on \ncounties,  particularly  economically  depressed  counties  with  small populations  such  as \nQuitman,  and  has  led  to  unequal  tax  burdens  among the  counties.  Complaint  {  22(b) \n(ARE  13).  The  complaint  also  alleges  that  chronic  underfunding  of indigent  defense  has \n  \nFootnote  continued  from  previous  page \nrecent  years,  Arkansas,  Louisiana,  Oklahoma,  and  South  Carolina  all  have  moved  to \nstate-funded  systems.\nresulted  in  a  failure  to  meet  constitutional  requirements  for  effective  assistance  of counsel \nand has  adversely  affected  the  administration of justice  in  Mississippi  and  in  Quitman \nCounty.  This  violates  Article  3,  Section  26  of the  Mississippi  Constitution,  which \nimposes  upon  the  State the  obligation to  ensure  effective  assistance  of counsel.  This  has \nalso  resulted  in undue pretrial  delay,  with  counties  spending  limited  funds  for pretrial \nincarceration  both  of guilty  defendants  who  should  have  been  sent to  state  correctional \nfacilities  much  sooner,  and  of innocent  defendants who  should not  be  in jail  at  all but \nmust  endure  delays  before  going  to  trial.  Complaint  {f  22(d,  e)  (ARE  14).  Quitman \nCounty  seeks  prospective  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief.  Complaint,  Prayer  for Relief \n(ARE  15-16). \nAfter  this  suit  had  been pending  for  eight  months,  the  Attorney  General’s  office \nmoved  to  dismiss  the  complaint  under  Miss.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(6),  arguing  that  the \nadministration  of the  criminal justice  system  is  not  the  business  of the  Courts,  but  instead \nis  the  exclusive province  of the  legislature.  The  Circuit  Court  of Quitman  County  denied \nthe  motion  with  respect  to  the  County’s  constitutional  claim,  holding  that  the  County’s \ncomplaint  should  be  fully  aired  in a  trial  at  which  it  will  have  the  opportunity  to  prove  its \ncontentions.”  The  State  has  filed  this  interlocutory  appeal,  asserting  that  Quitman  County \nshould  not  even  be  allowed  to  present  its  case  at  trial.  This  Court  has  granted \ninterlocutory review to  address  this  issue. \n  \n2  The  Circuit  Court  granted  the  State’s  motion  to  dismiss  the  County’s  separate \nstatutory  claim,  which  is  not  at  issue  here.\nSUMMOF AARRGUMYEN T \nThis  Court  long  has recognized the  severe  defects  in  delegating  indigent  defense \nfunding  to  individual  counties,  calling  upon  the  legislature  in Mease  and  Wilson  to \nimplement  a  state-created  program.  But  the  legislature  has  abandoned  this  duty.  In  such \na  situation,  particularly  where  the  proper constitutionally  mandated  right  to  effective \nassistance  of counsel  is  at  stake,  this  Court has  not  only  the  power,  but  the  duty,  to  take \naction.  Hosford v.  State,  525  So.  2d  789,  798  (Miss.  1988).  The  Attorney  General \ncontends  this  is  purely  a  legislative  matter  that  is  beyond  the  authority  of this  Court.  But \nprecedent,  as  well  as  the  consistent practice  of this  Court  in cases  like Jackson  vy.  State, \n732  So.  2d  187  (Miss.  1999),  demonstrates  that  the  Court  rightfully  possesses  the \nauthority  to  address  problems  in  the judicial  system  that  have  not  otherwise  been \ncorrected. \nThe  cases  that  address  the  obligation  to  provide  assistance  of counsel  to  indigent \npersons  make  it  clear  that this  is  an obligation  of “the  State.”  See,  e.g.,  Conn  v.  State,  170 \nSo.  2d  20,  21  (Miss.  1964).  Criminal  cases  are  prosecuted  in  the  name  of the  State  of \nMississippi  by  full-time  state-funded  prosecutors  in  order to  punish  violation  of state \nstatutes.  By  any  measure,  this  is  a  responsibility  that belongs  to  the  State  and  not  to  the \ncounties.  Moreover,  even  if the  State  has  the  power  somehow  to  impose  this  burden  as \nan operational  matter upon  the  counties,  the  State  retains  the  ultimate  responsibility  to \nlive  up  to  its  constituional  obligations.  When  counties  are  unable  to  provide  for  a \nconstitutionally  adequate  program of indigent  defense,  it  is  the  State’s  duty  to  rectify  the \nproblem  and  create  a constitutional  system. \n  \n \nThe Attorney  General  suggests  that  counties  have  no  standing  to  sue  the  State, \nand  that  the  only  means  by  which  courts  may  address  the  problems  of the  indigent \ndefense  system  are  through  after-the-fact,  case-by-case  adjudications  of ineffectiveness \nclaims  in post-conviction  petitions.  However,  this  Court’s  precedents  clearly  establish \nthat  counties  may  sue  the  State  and  may  obtain  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief when \nnecessary  to  secure  compliance  with  the  constitution.  Moreover,  in  decisions  like  Wilson \nand Jackson,  this  Court has  ordered  prospective  relief for  entire  classes  of cases  in  order \nto  cure  problems  in  the  indigent  defense  system,  never  suggesting  that  prospective \nchallenges  of this  type  are  somehow  precluded  from  the  purview  of the  courts. \nSince  this  is  an  appeal  of the  denial  of a motion  to  dismiss,  the  allegations  of the \ncomplaint  must be taken  as  true.  See Butler  v.  Board of Supervisors  of Hinds  County, \n659  So.  2d  at  581.  No  evidence  need be presented  and  it  is  not  the  function  of the  Circuit \nCourt  to  examine  or  weigh  the  evidence.  Here,  as  the  Circuit  Court  held,  the  allegations \nare  sufficient to  survive  a Rule  12(b)(6)  motion,  and  the  County  should  be  allowed  to \npresent  its  claims  at  trial.  Thus,  the  Attorney  General’s  selective  discussion  in his  brief \nof certain facts  concerning  the  Quitman  County  indigent  defense  system  are  as  irrelevant \nas  they  are  misleading.  But  even  if the  facts  were relevant  at  this  stage,  even  a  cursory \nexamination  of the  system  that  exists  in  this  State,  and  the manifestations  of that  system \nin  Quitman  County,  shows  that  indigent  defense  is  in  a  crisis.  This  is,  of course,  what  the \nlegislature  expressly  concluded  in  1998  when  it  passed  the  Act.  Unfortunately,  when \nfaced  with  the  obligation  of funding  the Act,  the  legislature  repealed  the  Act  two  years \nlater and  abandoned  the  effort  to  cure  the  systemic  deficiencies.  But  the  constitutional \n10 \n  \n \n laP : t problems  remain,  and  Quitman  County  should  be  allowed to  present  its  case  at  a  trial  so \nthat the  Circuit  Court  can  determine what judicial  remedy  is  appropriate. \n “\nARGUMENT. \nI,  THE  COURTS  OF  MISSISSIPPI  ARE  VESTED  WITH  THE \nAUTHORITY AND  DUTY TO  ADDRESS  CONSTITUTIONAL \nDEFICIENCIES  IN  THE  OPERATION  OF  THE  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE \nSYSTEM. \nAs  this  Court repeatedly has recognized,  the  county-based  system  of funding \n ,\nindigent  defense  gives  rise  to  serious  problems.  Thus,  ten years  ago,  this  Court  called \nupon  the  legislature  to  “address  the problem  of indigent  representation  on  a  statewide \nbasis,  rather than  thrust  the burden  on  financially-strapped  counties.”  Mease  v.  State,  583 \nSo.  2d  at  1285.  A  year  earlier,  the  Court  suggested  that  the  legislature revisit  the  funding \n . system,  and  asked:  “Since  the  State  funds  the  prosecution  in  these  cases,  why not  the \n -\n - defense?”  Wilson  v.  State,  574  So.  2d  at  1341. \n .\nAccording  to  the  Attorney  General,  no  matter how  serious  the  crisis  in  this  State’s \n *\n s criminal justice  system,  this  is  exclusively  a legislative  matter,  is  not  the  business  of the \n =\ncourts,  and  should  be  immune  from judicial  review.  AG  Br.  at  25-27.  However,  as \nillustrated by  a  long  line  of cases,  when  the  Legislature  does  not  act,  courts  have \n — i a authority  and the  inherent  duty  to  ensure  the  integrity  of the judicial  process.  As  the \nCourt  said  in Hosford v.  State: \n =\nIf [the  Legislature]  fails  to  fulfill  a  constitutional  obligation \nto  enable  the judicial  branch  to  operate  independently  and \n = effectively,  then  it  has  violated its  Constitutional  mandate, \nand  the  Judicial  branch  has  the  authority  as  well  as  the  duty \nto  see  that  courts  do  not  atrophy. \n525  So.  2d  at  798. \n :\n11 \n :\n   \nMore  recently,  the  Court  again  invoked  its  inherent duty  to  protect  the  integrity  of \nthe  court  system: \n[I]f the  Legislative branch  fails  in  its  constitutional  mandate \nto  furnish  the  absolute  essentials  required  for  the  operation \nof an  independent  and  effective  court,  then  no  court \naffected  thereby  should  fail  to  act.  It  is  the  absolute  duty  of \na court  in  such  latter  circumstances  to  act,  and  act \npromptly. \nWilson  v.  State,  574  So.  2d  at  1339  (quoting Hosford v.  State,  525  So,  2d  at  797-98). \nAccord,  e.g.,  State  v.  Blenden,  748  So.  2d  77,  86-87  (Miss.  1999)  (trial  courts  have \ninherent  authority  to  impose  monetary  sanctions  upon  State  or political  subdivision  for \ndiscovery violations  in  criminal  cases);  Newell v.  State,  308  So.  2d  71,  77-78  (Miss. \n1975)  (statutory provision  which prohibited judge  from  instructing jury  on  law  except  on \nrequest  by party  contravened  constitutional  mandates  that judiciary  fairly  administer \njustice). \nThis  principle  encompasses  matters  of funding  when  necessary.  In  Wilson,  the \nCourt  noted  that  in Hosford “we  discussed  our inherent  authority  to  provide  adequate \nfunding  for the  operation  of the  court  if the  Legislature  should  fail  to  so  provide.”  574 \nSo,  2d  at  1339, \nOne  of the  most recent  examples  of the  Court’s  decisiveness  in  the  wake  of \nlegislative  default  came  two  years  ago  with the  decision  in Jackson  v.  State.  For  several \nyears,  the  legislature  had declined  to  resolve  the problem  of counsel  for  indigent  death \nrow  prisoners  in post-conviction proceedings.  Finally,  by  1999,  when  it  “ha[d]  become \napparent that  the  system  is  flawed,”  the  Court  concluded  it  could  “no  longer  sit  idly  by” \nand  ordered  appointment  and  adequate  compensation  of counsel,  as  well  as payment  of \n12 \n \nreasonable  litigation  expenses,  including  investigation  and  expert  costs,  in  capital  post- \nconviction proceedings.  732  So.  2d  at  188-89,  191.  As  the  Court  stated: \nThe  Legislature  has  been  aware  of this  acute  problem \n[since  1995].  In  the  1998  session,  it  took  the  first  step \ntoward  the  institution  of a  statewide  public  defender \nsystem.  It  is  strongly  urged  that  the  Legislature  proceed \ntoward  a  solution  to  this  serious problem by  enacting  the \nprogram utilized in  Virginia or  some  other  system.  We  can \nnlg ongsite idrly b y. We  therefore  grant  the  motion. \nId.  at  191  (emphasis  added). \nJackson  provides  a  constructive  lesson  about  the  interplay  between  courts  and \nlegislatures  when  the  courts,  acutely  aware  of the  need,  exercise  their  authority  to  reform \naspects  of the judicial  system.  Jackson,  like  Wilson  and  Hosford before  it,  demonstrate \nthat  it  is  the  province  of the  courts  in  this  State  in  the  first  instance  to  determine  whether, \nand  if necessary,  to  ensure  that  the  criminal justice  system  functions  in  a  constitutional \nmanner.  If the  legislature  fails  to  act,  the  courts  are  not  obligated  to  “sit  idly  by.”  Jd. \nIndeed,  contrary  to  what the  Attorney  General  suggests  in  his  brief,  “it  is  the  absolute \nduty  of a  court  in  such  latter  circumstances  to  act,  and act  promptly.”  Wilson  v.  State,  574 \nSo.  2d  at  1339.  Only  after this  Court  issued  its  decision  in Jackson  and  held,  for  the  first \ntime,  that  death  row prisoners  were  entitled to  appointed  post-conviction  counsel,  did  the \nlegislature  comply  with  its  obligations  and  create  a  State-funded  capital  post-conviction \noffice. \nIf the  courts  in  the  present  case  issue  a  decision  holding  that  the  responsibility  for \nindigent  defense  properly  rests  with  the  State,  the  legislature  would  no  doubt  comply  with \nthe  court’s  rulings  as  it  did  in Jackson  and devise  a  solution.  But  without  decisive  action \nby  this  Court,  the  status  quo  will  remain  in place  for  years  to  come,  to  the  detriment  not \n13 \n \n \ne\nO\n aG only  of indigent  defendants,  but  also  of victims  forced  to  endure  delays  before  the \n \ne accused  is  brought  to  trial,  sheriffs  operating jails  overcrowded  with pretrial  detainees, \ne\n  judges  and  prosecutors  and  lawyers  laboring  in  an  inefficient  system,  and  taxpayers \nk\nE\nwasting  money  on  a  criminal justice  system  that  simply  does  not  work. \n \nI.  THE  DUTY  TO  PROVIDE  FOR ADEQUATE  ASSISTANCE  OF \nE\nCOUNSEL  IN  INDIGENT  CASES  RESTS  WITH  THE  STATE, \nE\nPARTICULARLY  WHERE  COUNTIES  CANNOT  AFFORD  TO \nE\nPROVIDE  IT  IN  A  CONSTITUTIONAL  MANNER. \n  In  the  landmark  case  of Conn  v.  State,  170  So.  2d  20  (Miss.  1964),  in  which  this \ne\ne\nCourt implemented  the  holding  of Gideon  v.  Wainwright,  372 U.S.  335  (1963),  this  Court \nmade  it clear  that  the  right  to  counsel  for  indigent  defendants  is  not  only  “fundamental \n  and  essential to  a  fair trial” but “is  .  ..  obligatory upon the States.”  Conn,  170  So.  2d  at  21 \nE\n(quoting  Gideon,  372  U.S.  at  342)  (emphasis  added).  In  Triplett  v.  State,  666  So.  2d \nm\n1356,  1357  (Miss.  1995),  the  Court  reiterated  that  this  right  “is  obligatory  on the  States,” \n(emphasis  added).  Once  again,  in  Vielee  v.  State,  653  So.  2d  920  (Miss.  1995),  the  Court \nstated  “[o]ur  decisions  make  clear  that  inadequate  assistance  does  not  satisfy  the \n[constitutional]  right  to  counsel made  applicable  to  the  States...  .” /d.  at  922  (quoting \nCuyler  v.  Sullivan,  446  U.S.  335,  344  (1989)).  Thus,  the  case  law  makes  it  clear that  the \nmaintenance  of a constitutional  system of indigent  defense  is,  as  a matter  of first \nprinciples,  the  obligation  of the  “State”  and  not  the  counties. \nIndeed,  criminal  cases  are  prosecuted  not  in  the  name  of counties,  but  in  the  name \nof the  State  of Mississippi.  They  are prosecuted by  full-time  State-funded  prosecutors, \nand  they  are  prosecuted  in  order  to  punish  alleged  violations  of State  statutes.  By  any \n14 \n   \nmeasure,  the proper  functioning  of the  criminal justice  system  is  a  responsibility that \nbelongs  to  the  State  and  not  to  the  counties. \nBut  even if the Attorney  General  is  correct  that  the  State  can  seek to  enlist  local \ngovernment  entities  in  helping to  discharge  the  State’s  constitutional  obligation,  the \nobligation  remains  with  the  State,  and  the  State  must  ensure  that  its  obligation  is  met.  For \nexample,  if a  county refused  to provide  and  fund  a  system  of indigent  defense —  either \nbecause  of financial bankruptcy  or other  reasons  — the  duty would unquestionably  fall  to \nthe  State.  Either the  courts,  or  the  executive,  or  the  legislature  would  be  required  to  find \na  means  to  ensure  an  adequate  defense  for  indigents  in  the  county,  and  the  State  would be \nrequired  to  pay  any necessary bills  in  the  absence  of county  funds.  Thus,  it  is  clear  that \nwhen  counties  are  unable  to  provide  for  a  constitutionally  adequate program  of indigent \ndefense,  it  is  the  State’s  responsibility to  rectify  the problem  and  to  create  a constitutional \nsystem.” \nThe  Attorney  General  cites  Article  14,  Section  261  of the  Mississippi \nConstitution,  which provides  “the  expenses  of criminal  prosecution  shall  be  borne by the \ncounty  in  which  such  prosecution  shall be begun.””  Whatever  that  provision  means  about \nthe  prosecution  of cases,  it  says nothing  about  the  obligation to  enforce  the  right  of \n  \n>  This  principle  has  been  illustrated  in  other  contexts  where  states  sought  to  impose \ntheir obligation  to  provide  an  effective  public  education  on  local  governments  that  did  not \nhave  the  resources  to  do  so.  See  Robinson  v.  Cahill,  303  A.2d  273,  292  (N.J.  1973) \n(“[t]he  obligation being  the  State’s  to  maintain  and  support  a  thorough  and  efficient \nsystem  of free  public  schools,  the  State  must meet  that  obligation  itself or if it  chooses  to \nenlist  local  governments,  it  must  do  so  in  the  terms  which  will  fulfill  that  obligation”); \nBrigham  y.  State,  692  A.2d  384,  395  (Vt.  1997)  (the  State  cannot  “abdicate  the basic \nresponsibility  for  education  by passing  it  on  to  local  governments”). \n15 \n \nr= \nindigent  citizens  to  the  effective  assistance  of defense  counsel.  When  Section  261  was \nadopted  as  a part  of the  1890  constitution,  government played  no  role  in  the  defense \ne \nfunction.  It  is  only  with  the  decisions  in  Gideon  and  Conn  that  the  courts  imposed  upon \n.  the  State  the  duty  to  provide  adequate  defense  assistance  in  indigent  cases.  Thus,  Section \n261  is  completely  irrelevant.  Indeed,  in Board of Supervisors  of George  County  v. \nBailey,  236  So.  2d  420  (Miss.  1970),  a  case  in  which  the  Court  declined  to  impose  on \ncounties  the  obligation  to  pay appointed  defense  counsel,  the  Court  expressly rejected  a \nclaim that  Section  261  requires  counties  to  pay  for  defense  counsel:  “There  is  nothing  in \n-  this  section  of the  Constitution to  indicate what  shall  constitute  an  expense  in  criminal \nprosecutions.”  Jd,  at  422.° \nII.  WHERE  COUNTIES  ARE  ADVERSELY  IMPACTED  BY  THE  STATE’S \nFAILURE  TO  ASSUME  ITS  CONSTITUTIONAL  RESPONSIBILITY, \nCOUNTIES  HAVE  STANDING  TO  SUE,  AND  THIS  COURT  IS  NOT \nLIMITED  TO  AFTER-THE-FACT,  PIECEMEAL  ADJUDICATION  TO \nCURE  SYSTEMIC  INDIGENT  DEFENSE  PROBLEMS. \n. \nThe  Attorney  General  contends  that  counties  do  not have  standing  to  sue the  State \nin this  instance.  According  to  the  Attorney  General,  only  individual  defendants  can raise \nissues  regarding  effectiveness  of counsel,  and  they  can  do  so  only  in  the  context  of their \nown  cases.  Thus,  the  Attorney  General  assets  this  Court  is  limited to  after-the-fact,  case- \nby-case  adjudication  if it  wants  to  address  ineffectiveness  problems  stemming  from  the \noperation  of the  indigent  defense  system.  AG Br.  at  25-36. \n~ \n  \n*  Moreover, a literal  reading  of Section  261  would  make  no  sense.  Although  it  says  the \n“expenses  of criminal  prosecution shail be  borne by the  county,”  (emphasis  added)  the \nState  obviously pays  for the  bulk  of criminal  prosecution,  including  the  prosecutors’ \nsalaries. \n—— \n16\nThis  case  does  not  seek relief on  behalf of any  individual  defendants  and  does  not \nseek to  set  aside  any  particular convictions.  See  Complaint,  Prayer  for  Relief (ARE  15- \n16).  It  is  not  focused  on  particular  cases,  but  instead  on  the  intolerable burden  that  the \nState  is  imposing  upon  counties  like  Quitman  County,  their  taxpayers,  their  governmental \nofficials,  and  indigent  defendants.  Relief should be  granted because  the  constitutional \nobligation  of indigent  defense  belongs  to  the  State,  not  the  counties,  and  at  any  rate, \nQuitman  County  cannot  afford to  perform  it  in  a constitutional  manner.  Moreover,  this \nCourt  is  not  limited to  the  case-by-case  adjudication  in  individual  criminal  cases  that  the \nAttorney  General  contends  is  the  only  means  for  correcting  problems  in the  operation of \nthe  indigent  defense  system  in  this  State.  If the  Court’s  role  were  as  limited  as  the \nAttorney  General  suggests,  the judiciary  would be  handcuffed  in  its  ability  to  instigate \nsystemic  reform  in  the justice  system. \nOn  the  question of standing,  it  is  well-settled  that  “Mississippi’s  standing \nrequirements  are  quite  liberal.”  Dunn  v.  Mississippi  State Dep't of Health,  708  So.  2d  67, \n70  (Miss.  1998);  see  also  Mississippi  Gaming  Comm'n  v.  Board of Educ.,  691  So.  2d \n452,  460  (Miss.  1997)  (same).  Mississippi  courts  have  been  “more permissive  in \ngranting  standing  to  parties  who  seek  review  of governmental  actions”  because  the  State \nhas  no  “case  or controversy”  requirement.  Van  Slyke  v.  Board of Trustees,  613  So.  2d \n872,  875  (Miss.  1993)  (“Van  Sivke IP’);  see  also Fordice  v.  Bryan,  651  So.  2d  998,  1003 \n(Miss.  1995)  (same);  Board of Trustees  v.  Van  Slyke,  510  So.  2d  490  (Miss.  1987)  (“Van \nSlyke  I’).  In Mississippi,  parties  have  standing  to  sue  or  intervene  “when  they  assert  a \ncolorable  interest  in  the  subject  matter  of the  litigation  or  experience  an  adverse  effect \nfrom  the  conduct  of the  defendant,  or  as  otherwise  provided  by  law.”  Fordice,  651 \nL? \n   \nSo.  2d  at  1003  (quoting  State  ex rel.  Moore  v.  Molpus,  578  So.  2d  624,  632  (Miss. \n1991)). \nMississippi’s  statutes  expressly provide  that  a  county  may  sue  and be  sued.  Miss. \nCode  Ann.  §  11-45-27.  Mississippi’s  statutes  also  specifically  authorize  counties  to  bring \nsuit  ‘‘in  the  name  of the  county,  where  only  part  of the  county  or  its  inhabitants  are \nconcemed,  and  where  there  is  a  public  right  to  be vindicated.”  Miss.  Code.  Ann.  §  11- \n45-19.  See  also  Van  Slyke I,  510  So.  2d  at 496  (standing by  individuals  and boards  is \nalso  permitted  in  Mississippi  in  any  “action  ..  .  concerning  a  matter  of general  public \ninterest...  .”).  Moreover,  this  Court  repeatedly  and  consistently  has  held  that  counties \nhave  standing  to  obtain  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief against  unconstitutional  statutes \nor  actions  by  the  State.  State  v.  Hinds  County Bd.  of Supervisors,  635  So.  2d  839,  842 \n(Miss.  1994),  See  also  State  v.  Mississippi Assoc.  of Supervisors,  Inc.,  699  So.  2d  1221 \n(Miss.  1997)  (action by  counties  and  association  against  State  resulting  in  a  decision  of \nthis  Court  striking  down a state  statute  as  unconstitutional);  Burrell v.  Mississippi State \nTax  Comm'n,  536  So.  2d  848  (Miss.  1988).° \nUnder  Mississippi  law,  counties,  like  any  other plaintiffs,  have  standing  to  sue \nwhere  “they  assert  a colorable  interest  in  the  subject  matter of the  litigation  or  experience \nan  adverse  effect  from  the  conduct  of the  defendant  or as  otherwise  authorized by  law.” \n  \n>  Despite  defendants’  efforts  to  treat  the  county  as  an  abstraction,  the interest  of the \ncounty  is  derived  from  the  interest  of the  citizens  of the  county.  Harrison  County  v.  City \nof Gulfport,  557  So.  2d  780,  783  (Miss.  1990).  The  board  of supervisors  is  the \ngovernmental  authority closest  to  those  people  and is  charged  to  protect  their  welfare.  Id. \nFor  this  reason,  the  county  is  a  particularly  appropriate  plaintiff in  this  case.  Moreover, \nthe  county’s  citizenry  includes  indigent criminal  defendants  prosecuted  in  the  Circuit \nCourt  of Quitman  County. \n18\nHarrison  County,  557  So.  2d  at  782  (citations  omitted).  Quitman  County  and  its \ntaxpayers  have  alleged  a  colorable  interest  in  the  subject  matter  of the  litigation;  they \nhave  alleged  an  adverse  effect  from  the  conduct  of the  defendants;  and  the  county  is \nspecifically  authorized  to  sue  by  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  11-45-17,  19  and  19-3-47(1)(b). \nThis  suit  was  duly  authorized  by  the  Quitman  County Board  of Supervisors.  Complaint \n§  6  (ARE  8).  Accordingly,  it  is  clear  Quitman  County has  standing  to  assert  its  claims. \nLikewise,  the  Attorney  General’s  assertion  that prospective  systemic  relief is \nunavailable  in  this  case,  and that  this  Court  is  limited  to  case-by-case,  after-the-fact \nadjudication  is  wrong,  both  as  a  matter  of law  and  as  a matter  of practicality.  Itis  wrong \nas  a  matter of law  because  the  precedents  of this  Court make  clear  that  the  courts  of this \nstate  have  the  power to  grant  prospective  relief to  remedy  systemic  problems  with  the \ncriminal justice  system.  Specifically,  in  both  Wilson  and Jackson,  this  Court  granted \nprospective  relief to  entire  classes  of future  cases  as  a means  of addressing  deficiencies  in \nthe  indigent  defense  system. \nIn  addition,  other  courts  addressing  the  precise  issue  here  have held  that \nprospective  relief can  be  granted.  In Luckey v.  Harris,  860  F.2d  1012  (11th  Cir.  1988), \nrey'd on  abstention  grounds  sub  nom.,  Luckey v.  Miller,  976  F.2d  673  (11th  Cir.  1992) \nthe  United  States  Court  of Appeals  for the  Eleventh  Circuit  reversed  the  granting  of a \nRule  12(b)(6)  motion  and  allowed  an  action  seeking prospective  injunctive  relief to \nremedy  systemic  deficiencies  in the  Georgia  indigent  criminal  defense  system  to  proceed. \nThe  Luckey  case  concerned  a  class  action  filed  on  behalf of all  indigent  persons  who \nwould be  charged  with  criminal  offenses  in the  future  in  Georgia,  and  all  attorneys  in  the \nState  of Georgia  who  represent  such  persons,  alleging  systemic  deficiencies  in  the \n19 \n \nGeorgia  criminal justice  system,  including  failure  to  provide  adequate  resources.  The \nCourt  of Appeals  specifically  held  that  it  is  perfectly  appropriate  and  consistent  with  the \nSupreme  Court’s  decision  in  Strickland v.  Washington,  466  U.S.  668  (1984)  for  a \nplaintiff to  prove  that  a  criminal justice  system  systemically  results  in  ineffective  defense \nservices,  860  F.2d  at  1017.  This  is  precisely  how  the  present  litigation  has  been \nstructured. \nLikewise,  the highest  courts  of numerous  states  have  granted  prospective  relief to \nremedy  systemic  inadequacies  in  indigent  criminal  defense  systems  where  the  legislature \nfailed  to  act.  See,  e.g.,  State  v.  Peart,  621  So.  2d  780,  791  (La.  1993)  (creating  a \n“presumption  that  indigents  ..  .  are  receiving  assistance  of counsel  not  sufficiently \neffective  to  meet  constitutionally  required  standards” to  be  applied  prospectively); \nState  vy.

Va.  1989)  (‘[I]t  is  unrealistic  to  expect  all  appointed  counsel  ..  .  to  remain \ninsulated  from  the  economic  reality  of losing  money  each  hour  they work.  ..  .  Inevitably, \neconomic  pressure  must  adversely  affect  the  manner  in  which  at  least  some  cases  are \nconducted.”’)  (ordering  increased  compensation  for  appointed  counsel  in  future  cases); \nState  v.  Smith,  681  P.2d  1374,  1384  (Ariz.  1984)  (creating  in  future  trials  “an  inference \nthat  the  procedure  resulted  in  ineffective  assistance  of counsel”).° \n  \n°  Many  other  courts  have  recognized  the  existence  of a  link between  the  features  of the \nindigent  defense  system  and the  quality  of representation provided,  thus  demonstrating \nthat prospective  injunctive  relief to  remedy  systemic  deficiencies  is  appropriate.  See, \né.g.,  Hill vy.  Reynolds,  942  F.2d  1494,  1496  (10th  Cir.  1991)  (holding  that  public \ndefenders’  inability  to  file  appellate briefs  rendered  their  assistance  ineffective);  State  ex \nrel.  Friedrich  y.  Circuit  Court,  531  N.W.2d  32,  35  (Wis.  1995)  (holding  that  courts \nshould  order  compensation  at  rate  exceeding  statutory  fee  schedule  when  necessary  to \nFootnote  continued on next page \n20 \n   \nMoreover,  the  nature  of the  particular  claims  brought  here  do  not  lend  themselves \nto  a  series  of challenges  by  individual  defendants  in  an  individual  criminal  cases.  In  an \nindividual  case,  the  defendant  must  prove  that  his  counsel’s  performance  fell  below \nacceptable  standards,  and  that  this  deficiency prejudiced  the  outcome  in  the  particular \ncase.  The  inquiry  is,  by  necessity,  case-specific,  and  in  no  way  examines  or  addresses  the \nlarger  impact  of systemic problems.  Consequently,  the  available  relief is  also,  by \nnecessity,  individual  to  each  defendant.  Thus,  while  it  is  true  that  in  an  effective  system \nany defendant who  received  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  which  unfairly  prejudiced \nhis  case  could  ultimately  get  his  conviction  reversed,  no  relief would  be  available  to  the \nCounty  or  its  taxpayers.  Rather,  ironically,  the  County  and  its  taxpayers  would  pay \ntwice  --  once  for  the  ineffective  assistance  and  again  to  challenge  it.  In  the  present  case, \nby  contrast,  Quitman  County  seeks  to  prove  that  it does  not  have  the  resources  to  carry \nthe  burden  thrust  upon  it,  and  that  absent  those  resources,  it  cannot  do  the job  in  a \nconstitutional  manner.

Even  if the  courts  were  to  order  in  such  cases  that \nmore money  be  spent  on  a  particular defense  service  in  future  cases  (such  as  expert \nwitnesses),  the  defendant  arguably  would  not  as  strong  an  interest  in  arguing  that the \ncosts  be  paid by  the  State  as  opposed  to  the  counties. \nThe  Attorney  General  claims  that  “the  adequacy  of public  defender  funding  has \nbeen,  and  will  continue  to  be,  challenged  in  proper  criminal  proceedings.”  AG Br.  at  33. \nBut  that  is  not  the  case.  While  some  funding  issues  have  been raised  in  individual  cases, \nthe  sort  of systemic  issues  raised  here —  including  those  about  who  has  ultimate \nresponsibility  for  indigent  defense  —  simply  do  not  arise  in  individual  cases. \nIn  sum,  Quitman  County  has  standing  to  bring  this  case,  the  courts  of this  State \nhave  the  power  to  adjudicate  it,  and,  if the  County’s  claims  are  proven  at trial,  the  courts \nof this  State  also  have  the  power  to  order  appropriate  relief necessary  to  cure  the \nproblems,  including,  if necessary,  prospective,  systemic  relief. \n22 \n \nIV.  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL’S  FACTUAL  CONTENTIONS  ARE \nIRRELEVANT  TO  AN  APPEAL  FROM  THE  DENIAL  OF A  MOTION  TO \nDISMISS,  BUT  THE  RECORD  DEMONSTRATES  SYSTEMIC, \nCONSTITUTIONAL  DEFICIENCIES  IN  MISSISSIPPIPS  INDIGENT \nDEFENDER  SYSTEM. \nThe  Attorney  General’s  brief identifies  a few  selective  facts  about  the  quality of \nrepresentation  for  indigent  persons  in  Quitman County  that  are  irrelevant,  particularly  in \nlight  of the  procedural  posture  of this  appeal  from  the  denial  of a motion  to  dismiss.  In \nsuch  a  situation,  the  allegations  of the  complaint must  be  taken  as  true,  and the  denial  of \nthe  motion  to  dismiss  must be  affirmed  unless  there  is  a  “certainty  that  the  plaintiff is \nentitled  to  no  relief under  any  set  of facts  that  could  be proven  in  support  of the  claim.” \nMiss.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(6),  comment. \nBut  even  if the  facts  were  relevant  at  this  stage,  the  information  obtained  through \ndiscovery,  as well  as  that  which Quitman  County will  present  at  trial,  demonstrates \nsignificant  constitutional  flaws  in  the  current  system  of indigent  defense. \nFor  example,  the  record  includes  the  affidavit  of Thomas  Fortner,  the  Chief \nLitigator  and  Chief of Staff for the  Office  of the  Hinds  County  Public  Defender,  one  of \nthe  few  full-time  indigent  defense  offices  in the  State.  Fortner  Aff.  §  2  (ARE  863).  In  an \nanalysis  of the  deficiencies  of the  county-based  funding  system  (particularly  the  part-time \nflat-fee  system)  as  manifested  throughout  the  State,  Mr.  Fortner  concluded,  “that  there \nexists  a  serious,  systemic,  statewide  deficiency  in  the provision  of defense  services  to \nindigent  defendants  in  the  state  courts  of Mississippi.”  Fortner  Aff.  |  6  (ARE  864-65). \nThe Fortner affidavit  describes  how these  inadequacies  play  out  in  virtually  every  aspect \n23 \n  \n \nof the  provision  of defense  services,  including pretrial  detention,’  inadequate  pretrial \ninvestigation,®  use  of experts,’  and  trial  performance.’° \nThe  Fortner  affidavit  also  explains  how  inadequate  resources  --  and  the  gross \ndisparity  between  the  funding  and  resources  available  to  prosecutors’  offices  as  compared \nto  part-time  indigent  defenders  --  directly  and  severely  harm the  quality  of representation \nafforded  to  defendants.  Jd.  J§  7-10  (ARE  865-67).  He  describes  how  as  a result  of this \ndisparity,  “there  are  far  fewer  defense  counsel  representing  indigent  defendants  than  there \nare  prosecutors  prosecuting those  defendants,  for the  same  number  of cases.”  Id.  |  6 \n(ARE  864).  Furthermore,  those  lawyers  that  are  appointed  as  defense  counsel  “are \nvirtually  never  specialists  in  criminal  law  procedure,  and  in  many  instances,  [these] \ncounsel  have  had  no  training whatsoever in  criminal  law....”  7d.  {9  (ARE  866). \nMoreover,  prosecutors  are  able  to  employ  “full-time  private  investigators”  and  are \nsupported  by  State  agencies  like  the  State  Crime  Laboratory,  not  to  mention  the  services \n  \n?  «J  am  aware  of specific  cases  in  which  defendants  languished  in jail  for  months \nbefore  even  seeing  their  appointed  defense  counsel.”  Jd.  6  (ARE  864-65). \n*  “I  am  aware  of numerous  specific  cases,  involving  serious  felony  charges,  in  which \ndefense  counsel  could  not  obtain  the  services  of an investigator.  Consequently,  those \ncounsels  did  not obtain potentially  vital  witness  statements  and  other  materials  critical  to \nan  even  minimally  adequate  defense.”  /d.  J  7  (ARE  865). \n°  “Tn  some  ..  .  cases,  the  expert  testimony  presented  by  the  prosecution  was  seriously \nflawed  in  ways  that  would  have  been  illuminated  for  the  court had  adequate  expert \nservices  been  available  to  the  defendant.”  /d.  7  (ARE  865). \n‘0  “In  many  ...  cases,  defendants  were  convicted  without  defense  counsel  having \npresented  exculpatory  evidence...  .”  and  “I  am  also  aware  of specific  cases  in  which \nexpert testimony  was  offered by  the  government  at  trial,  and  defense  counsel  was  utterly \nunable  to  meet  that testimony,  either  through  cross-examination  of the  prosecution \nwitnesses,  or the  presentation  of an  effective  defense...  .”  /d.  ¢  7  (ARE  865). \n24\nof police  departments  and  other public  law  enforcement  agencies,  id.  4  8,  while  appointed \nindigent  defense  counsel  have  “virtually no  access to  investigative  services.”  Jd.  ]  7. \nThe  Fortner  affidavit  further  explains  how  the  lack  of defense  counsel  and  of \ninvestigative,  expert  and  other  resources  and  training  undermines  the  administration of \njustice. Jd.  (ARE  865-66).  He notes  that he  has  observed  defendants  being  convicted \nwithout  substantial  exculpatory  evidence  having  been  presented  at  trial  because  of a  lack \nof an  adequate  investigation.  /d.  [7  (ARE  865).) \nThe Spangenberg Studies.  The record  in  this  case  also  includes  a  series  of \nstudies  conducted by the  Spangenberg  Group,  a nationally  known  consulting \norganization,  for the  Mississippi  Bar Association  (and  subsequently  for  the  Mississippi \nPublic  Defender  Commission).  The  Spangenberg  Group  found  that  indigent  defense  in \nMississippi  is  in  a  perilous  state. \nAfter conducting  extensive  survey  research  and budget  analyses,  the  Spangenberg \nstudies  concluded  that  funding  for indigent  defense  in  the  State  of Mississippi  through the \nexisting  funding  mechanism  is  wholly  inadequate.  Spangenberg  Report  at  51  (ARE  434). \n  \n''  In  addition  to  what  is  presently  in  the  record,  Plaintiff intends  to  present  at  trial  the \ntestimony  of Steve  Bright,  who  is  a nationally  recognized  attorney,  law professor,  and \nleading  expert  on  indigent  defense  systems.  Professor Bright will  testify  that  the  public \ndefender  system,  as  manifested  in  Quitman  County,  is  constitutionally  infirm  in that  the \ncounty-based  system of public  defense  in  many instances  violates  national  standards  for \neffective representation,  including  the  National  Legal  Aid  and Defender Association’s \nPerformance  Guidelines for  Criminal Defense Representation  and  the  American Bar \nAssociation’s  Standards for  Criminal Justice.  We  anticipate  that Professor  Bright  will \nprovide  a  comprehensive  review  of the  trial  and  appellate  court  files  of defendants  in  the \nCounty,  and  will  conclude  that there  is  a widespread  and  pervasive  failure  to  provide \neffective  representation  to  indigent persons  in  all  aspects  of pre-trial,  trial,  and post- \ntrial/appellate  practice. \n25 \n   \nFor  example,  the  Spangenberg  report  found  that  Mississippi  spends  $3.24  per  resident  on \na per capita  basis  for  indigent  criminal  defense  efforts  —  far  less  than  any  other  state  in  the \ncountry.  Spangenberg  1998  Update  at  20  (ARE  551).  The  studies  further  found  that  the \nState  of Mississippi  also  ranked  last  among  the  states  surveyed  on  amount  spent  per \nindigent  defense  case  ($128.89).  Spangenberg  1997  Update  at  14  (ARE  504).  The \nstudies  also  reached  a number  of other  pertinent  conclusions  about  the  state  of indigent \ndefense  in  Mississippi. \nFirst,  the  Spangenberg  studies  concluded  that  the  lack  of adequate  resources  for \nindigent  defense  services  results  in  poor  quality  services  and  representation  that  falls \nbeneath  the minimum  standards  of representation  required by the  Mississippi \nConstitution.  Not  only  are  the  resources  that  are  available  prioritized  for  the  most  serious \ncases,  leaving  “indigents  [who]  fac([e]  misdemeanor  or juvenile  delinquency  charges” \nwithout  counsel  altogether,  but  the  studies  found  that  even  in  felony  cases,  resources  are \nnot  sufficient.  Spangenberg  Report  at  51  (ARE  434).  According  to  the  study,  “[e]very \naspect  of defense  representation  is  compromised,”  with  very  little  “early  representation \nprovided,  investigation  conducted,  attorney-client  contact,  or  use  of experts.” fd.  at  51-52 \n(ARE  434-35).  Moreover,  the  absence  of statewide  oversight  of indigent  defense  leads  to \na  hodgepodge,  county-by-county  approach  to  providing  defense  services.  /d.  at  52. \nWithout  statewide  oversight,  “there  is  no  entity to  ensure  that...  even  minimal  parity  in \nresources  between  prosecutors  and  public  defenders  will  be  upheld.” /d.  at  53. \nSecond,  the  State’s  lack  of involvement  in the  provision of indigent  defense  and \nthe  inadequate  resources  available  for indigent  defense  means  that  constitutional \n26\nrequirements  for  the  effective  assistance  of counsel  often  are  not  met.  The  Spangenberg \nstudies  concluded,  for  example: \nThe  resources  provided  to  contract  public  defenders  are \npitiful  in  comparison  with  those provided  to  county \nattorneys  and district  attorneys.  Contract  public  defenders \nare  seldom  provided  with  office  space,  expenses,  or  support \nstaff.  Contract  defenders  do  not  have  ready  access  to \ninvestigators  or  other  experts.  They  must  motion  to  the \ncourt  each  time  these  services  are  required.  Contract \ndefenders  must  handle  any  appeals  arising  from  their  cases, \nand  do  not  receive  any  additional  compensation  to  do  so. \nContract public  defenders  simply  do  not  have  the necessary \ntools  required  of criminal  defense  attorneys  to  assure \nadequate  representation  for indigent  defendants.  .. . \nContract  defenders  are  allowed  to  have private  criminal \npractices,  which  can  raise  conflicts  with  their public \ndefender  clients. \nTd.  at  51-52. \nThird,  and  most  importantly,  the  Spangenberg  studies  found  that  there  were  a \nnumber  of steps  that  the  State  of Mississippi  could  take  to  address  these  problems.  The \nstudies  specifically noted  that  Arkansas,  Louisiana,  South  Carolina,  and  Oklahoma  all \nhave  recently  adopted  statewide,  state-funded public  defender  systems,  leaving \nMississippi  as  one  of just  a  handful  of states  which provide  no  state  funds  for  indigent \ndefense.  Spangenberg  1998  Update  at  4-11  (ARE  516-523).  The  studies  proposed  two \nmain  solutions  to  the  indigent  defense problem  in  Mississippi.  Specifically,  the  studies \npropose  that  “‘a  new  statewide  system,  organized  by  circuit  court  district,  be  created  that \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  delivery  of all indigent  defense  services  .  .  .  [in]  Mississippi.” \nSpangenberg  Report  at  60  (ARE  441).  In  addition,  the  studies  recommend  that  “the  total \nfunding  for  indigent  defense  services  in Mississippi  be  increased.”  Jd. \n27 \n   \nPublic Defender Testimony.  In  addition  to  the  testimony that  was  adduced \nthrough  experts  and  expert  analyses  of Mississippi’s  indigent  defense  system,  fact \ndiscovery  in  this  matter  further  supports  Quitman  County’s  case.  The  deposition \ntestimony  of Thomas  Pearson  and  Alan  Shackleford,  the  two  part-time  lawyers  who  were \nappointed  to  represent  all  indigent  defendants  in  Quitman  County  since  1990, \nundisputedly  confirms  the  gross  disparity  of resources  and  the  inadequacy  of services \nprovided  to  indigent  defendants.  Mr.  Pearson  characterized  the  enormous  disparity \nbetween  the  extensive  resources  he  enjoyed  when  he  was  a  county prosecutor  and  his \npaltry  resources  as  a public  defender as  “Like  a  mountain  to  a  molehill.”  Pearson  Dep. \n82  (ARE  1728).  He  observed  that  “[A]s  a prosecutor,  you’ve  got  all  law  enforcement \noffices  and  agencies  at  your  disposal;  whereas,  as  a  public  defender,  you  have  no  one  at \nyour  disposal.””*  Ja. \nMr.  Pearson  testified that  his  indigent  clients  were  not  entitled  to  “the  best  lawyer \nin  the  county.”  Pearson Dep.  95-96  (ARE  1741-42).  Instead,  Mr.  Pearson believed that \nhis  indigent  clients were  entitled to  a “country  lawyer,”  and  he  stated  that  he  did  a \n  \n'2  Mr.  Pearson  testified  that he  eamed  $1350.00  per month  as  a part-time  public \ndefender.  Pearson  Dep.  74  (ARE  1720).  Mr.  Pearson’s  salary  was  paid  out  of the \ngeneral  fund  of Quitman  County,  MS.  Pearson Dep.  Exh.  1.  From  1995  to  2000, \nMr.  Pearson  represented  indigent  defendants  in  approximately  156  felony  cases  in \nQuitman  County,  MS.  Pearson Dep.  54,  Pearson  Dep.  Exh.  3  (ARE  1700).  During  this \ntime,  Mr.  Pearson  also  maintained  a private  criminal  practice.  Pearson  Dep.  45  (ARE \n1691).  Mr.  Pearson  testified  that he handled  10  criminal  cases per month  for  a  fee. \nPearson  Dep.  45  (ARE  1691).  In his  private  criminal  practice,  Mr.  Pearson  was  paid \napproximately  $350.00  per  case  for misdemeanor cases  and  $750.00-$15,000.00 per \nfelony  case,  depending  on  the  severity  of the  charge.  Pearson  Dep.  46-47  (ARE \n1692-93).  He  also  handles  part-time  public  defender  duties  in  other counties.  Pearson \nDep.  47-50  (ARE  1693-96). \n28 \n   \n“country  lawyer job  for  them.”  /d.  Mr.  Pearson  speculated  that  he  may  have  been \nterminated  for  this  reason.\" \nThe  time  and  resource  limitations  placed  on part-time  defenders  by  the  county- \nbased  system  have  hampered  the  ability  of these  lawyers  to  do  their job.  Mr.  Pearson \ntestified  that  he  generally  met  with  several  defendants  as  a  group,  on  the  day  of their \narraignments.  Pearson Dep  59  (ARE  1705).  He  does no  background  investigation  of \nwitnesses  called  by the  State.  Pearson  Dep.  70-71  (ARE  1716-17).  He  has  never \nrequested  court  funding  to  hire  an  investigator  in  a noncapital  criminal  case,  and \nexplained  that  he  would  not  have  asked  for  an  investigator  in  a  noncapital  criminal  case \neven  if he believed that  one  was  needed,  because  he  believed  the  request  would  have \nbeen  denied  by  the  court.  Pearson  Dep.  92-94  (ARE  1738-40).  Mr.  Pearson \nacknowledged,  however,  that  he  would  make  greater use  of investigators  in  his  criminal \ncases  if he  had  the  funds.  Pearson  Dep.  62  (ARE  1708).  Specifically,  he  would  use  any \ninvestigatory  assistance  that  was needed  in  a  case.  Pearson  Dep.  80  (ARE  1726). \nIndeed,  he  admitted  that  he  has been  forced  to  use  his  personal  funds  to  hire  investigators \nin noncapital  criminal  cases.  /d.  Mr.  Pearson  also  testified  that  in  the  proper  case  and  if \nthe  funding  was  available  to  him,  he  would  use  experts.  Pearson  Dep.  69-70  (ARE  1715- \n16).  Finally,  Mr.  Pearson  testified  that  the  quantity  and  quality  of representation  by  part- \ntime public  defenders  would  be  improved  with more  funding.  Pearson  Dep.  78  (ARE \n  \n‘3  Mr.  Pearson testified  that  the  Circuit  Court judge  told  him  that  he was  being  fired  as  a \npart-time  public  defender because  there  had  been  many  complaints  about  him.  Mr. \nPearson  acknowledged  that  his  clients  complained  to  him  about his  lack of \ncommunication  with  them.  Pearson  Dep.  87  (ARE  1733).  He  has responded  to  such \ncomplaints  by telling  his  clients  that he  did  not have  time  to  be  their “pen  pal.” /d. \n29 \n \n1724).  Mr.  Pearson  stated  that  if the  system  was  adequately budgeted,  he  could have \nspent  more  time  on  individual  cases  and  he  could  have  assessed  each  case  more \nadequately.  Pearson Dep.  79,  81  (ARE  1725-27).'* \nAt trial,  Quitman  County  will  present  ample  proof that  the  chronic  problems  with \nthe  county-based  indigent  defense  system  as manifested  in  Quitman  County,  have \nresulted  in  systemic  constitutional  deficiencies,  including  the  following: \n°  systemic  denials  of pre-trial  access  to  counsel  (see  Gerstein  v.  Pugh,  420 \nU.S.  103  (1974)  (right  to  a preliminary  hearing  at  which  counsel  is \nappointed  within  72  hours  of incarceration)); \ne  systemic  denials  of pre-trial  investigation  (see,  e.g.,  Triplett  v.

Cabana, \n764  F.2d  1173  (Sth  Cir.  1985)); \n°  systemic  denials  of fourth  and  fifth  amendment  rights  (see,  e.g., \nKimmelman  v.  Morris,  477  U.S.  365  (1985);  Triplett,  666  So.  2d  1356 \n(Miss.  1996);  Hunyah  v.

App.  1994)); \n°  systemic  denials  of the  right  to  expert  assistance  (see  Ake  v.  Oklahoma, \n470  U.S.  68  (1985),  Blake  v.  Kemp,  758  F.2d  523  (1  1th  Cir.  1985); \nBouchillon  v.  Collins,  907  F.2d  589  (Sth  Cir.  1990);  Profit  v.

Newsome,  888  F.2d  112  (11th  Cir.  1989)); \n  \n\"4  Mr.  Shackleford provided  similar  testimony.  He  was  the  public  defender  in \napproximately  130  cases  in  Quitman  County,  from  1995  to  2000.  Mr.  Shackleford \ntestified  that  he  has  never used  an  investigator  or requested  funds  from  the  court  to  hire \nan  investigator.  Shackleford  Dep.  43-44  (ARE  1580-81).  Mr.  Shackleford  also  testified \nthat  he  has  never  sought  court  funding  to  hire  an  expert witness.  Shackleford Dep.  44 \n(ARE  1581). \n30\ne  systemic  denials  of the  right  to  competent  advice  in pleas  (see,  e.g., \nLeatherwood  vy.

Sullivan,  446  U.S.  335  (1980),  and \nGlasser  vy.  United States,  315  U.S.  60  (1942)). \nThe  evidence  catalogued  in  this  section  of the  brief is  only  a  small  part  of the \nproof that  will  be  offered  at  trial.  But  it  demonstrates  serious  problems  with \nMississippi’s  indigent defense  system,  and it  shows  why  only  a  full  trial  will  resolve  the \ncontentions  in  Quitman  County’s  Complaint.  The  Mississippi  Legislature  has  abdicated \nits  obligation to  address  this problem —  only this  Court  can  afford  relief to  the  72  counties \nin  Mississippi  and  their  respective  citizens. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  order  of the  Circuit  Court  should  be  affirmed,  the \nstay issued  by  this  Court  vacated,  and  the  matter returned  to  the  Circuit  Court  for trial. \nDated:  April  11,  2001 \nBip  submitted, \n  \nFE Ch  Y  : \nBar No.  2532 \n767  North  Congress  Street \nJackson,  MS  39202 \n(601)  969-0802 \nDennis  C.

Stripped  of the  fanfaronade  of “fair and  efficient”  representation,  this  case  hinges \nfirst  and  foremost  on a  chalJenge  to  the  authority of the  Legislature  to  define  the  financial \nobligations  of counties.  Counties  were  created  for  one  purpose:  to  serve  as  subdivisions  and \nagencies  of State  government  under  the  contro]  of the  Legislature.  The  Legislature  has  provided \nboards  of supervisors  with the  ability  to  raise  revenue  and  create  a  budget to  meet  the  obligations \nof the  county.  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  19-3-41(1).  The  Legislature  has  defined  the  responsibilities  of \ncounties  to  include,  among  other  items,  the  obligation  to  assist the  State  in  the  provision  of \npublic  defenders  for  county  residents  — the  State  providing  defenders  in  capital  cases  and \ncounties providing  such  in non-capital  cases.  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  99-18-1,  99-39-101,  25-32-1; \nsee also  Miss.  Const.  Art.  14,  Sect.  261.  The  Board’s  argument  that any  statutory  requirement \nthat  counties  assist  in the  provision  of public  defenders  must be  “unconstitutional”  is  legally \nunsupportable. \nSimply  stated,  a  county  has  no  constitutional  right to  be  free  from  “unfunded  mandates.” \nThis  Court  has  properly  denied  previous  county  requests  for  a judicial  determination that the \nLegislature  has  misjudged  county  resources  Indeed,  what  is  the  standard  by  which  Judge  Smith \nwould  evaluate  whether  a  statute  requiring  counties to  fund  non-capital  public  defenders  is \n“anconstitutionally  burdensome”?  The  arguments  of the  Quitman  Board  and briefs  amicus \ncuriae are  unvarnished  policy  arguments  misdirected  to  this  forum,  without  constitutional\nfoundation,  and  previously  rejected  by  this  Court.’  It  is  undisputed  that  the  Legislature  has \n“creator's  power’  to  contro!  counties  and  “ft}he  revenues  of a  county  are  subject  to the  control  of \nthe  Legislature,  and  when the Legislature  directs  their  application to  a particular purpose  or  to  the \npayment  of the  claims  of particular parties,  the  obligation to  so  pay  is  thereby  imposed  on  the \ncounty.”  State v. Hinds County,  635  So.2d  839,  843  (Miss.  1994); Jackson County v. Neville,  95 \nSo,  626,  628  (Miss.  1932).  Ifa  county  fails to  fulfill  its  statutory  obligation to  adequately  fund  a \nprogram  vital  to  the judiciary,  it  is  not  entitled  to  a  constitutional  pardon  from  such  statutes. \nInstead,  “county  boards  of supervisors,  which  have  imposed  upon  them  the  statutory  duty  [to \nfund judicial  programs],  are  subject to  appropriate  court  orders  requiring  them to  do  so  when \nthey  adamantly  fail or  refuse to  do  so.”  Hosford  v.  State,  525  So.2d  789,  798  (Miss.  1988) \n(emphasis  supplied). \nSuch  clear  and  longstanding  decisions  of this  Court  foreclose  the  Quitman  Board’s \nassertion that  it  is  “constitutionally”  entitled  to  be  relieved  of its  statutory  duty  to  assist  the  State \nin  the  provision  of public  defenders.  Such  decisions  also  foreclose  the  ability  of this  specific \nplaintiff —  the  Board  — to  argue  that  the  public  defender  system  has  caused  “systemic  ineffective \nassistance  of counsel”  because  it  has  refused  to  fulfill  its  statutory  obligation to  adequately  fund \npubic  defenders  in  non-capital  cases?  Indeed,  if a  statewide  funding  crisis  for public  defenders \n  \n'The  very  presence  of amici  in  this  matter,  and  the  policy  arguments  they  submit, \nimplicitly  recognize  the  lack  of legal  foundation  for  the  Board’s  sweeping  allegations  of \n“unfunded  mandates,”  “systemic  ineffective  assistance,”  and  calls  for  a judicially  created  state- \nsupported  program. \n*It  is  important to  point  out that  note  that the  State  and  the  Quitman  County  public \ndefenders  vigorously  deny  the  Board’s  allegation  of ineffective  assistance.  See  State  Br.  at  28. \nNo  indigent  defendant  in  Quitman  County  has  been  found  by  a  court to  have  received  ineffective \n2 \n  \n \ndid exist,  it would be  irresponsible  of the  Board  to  argue that this  Court  should  limit public \ndefender  resources  to  merely  one  source. \nImportantly  though,  the  State  is  not  suggesting  that  individual  defendants  cannot  argue \nthat the  system  has  denied  them  their  specific  right to  counsel.  Each  indigent  defendant  is  able  to \n(before  trial,  at trial,  or  after trial)  argue to  the  trial  court or  an appellate  court that  he  is  receiving \nor  had  received  ineffective  assistance  of counsel.  Each  indigent  defendant  is  able  to  argue  that \nthe  “system”  is  so  flawed  that  it  has  resulted in  a  specific  error  on  the  part  of counsel  which \ndenied  her  of the  right to  counsel.  The  Quitman  Board  argues  that  “individual”  challenges  fail  to \naddress  prospective  remedies  or  large  scale  problems.  But,  from Wilson to  this  Court’s  decision \nin  State  v.  Jackson,  changes  in the  public  defender  system  have  always  come  from  challenges  by \nindividual  indigent  defendants.  Indeed,  the  Board  has  failed  to  point  to  a  single  “ineffective \nassistance”  claim  that  has  been  brought by  anyone  other than  an  indigent  defendant  facing  an \nalleged  denial  of the  right  to  counsel.  In  this  respect,  the  Board  provides  no justification  for  the \ndeparture  from  this  Courts  pronouncement  in  Wilson v.  State that  “ineffective  assistance  of \ncounsel  is  a  matter  that  is  better  decided  on a  case  by  case  basis  .  .  .  .  handled  and  determined \nindividually  by  the  appellate  courts.”  547  So.2d  1338,  1340  (Miss.  1990). \nMoreover,  this  Court  and  the  decisions  of other  courts  cited  by  the  Board  have  explicitly \nrejected  arguments  that  “ineffective  assistance  of counsel”  may  be  demonstrated  by  general \nallegations  regarding  compensation  or  workload  of the  type  contained  in  the  complaint.  See \n  \nassistance.  Moreover,  there  is  no  dispute  that  the  county  public  defenders  are  not  overworked. \nIn  1999,  one  defender was  assigned  to just  fourteen  (14)  cases  and  the  other  merely  nineteen (19) \ncases.  See  State  Br.  at  8. \n   \nWilson,  547  So.2d  at  1340,  Cabevl. lStaote ,  524  So.2d  313,  316  (Miss.  1988)  (“caseload  and \n  \nlimited  resources  are,  absent.specific  instances  of error”  insufficient to  find  ineffectiveness);  | \nState  v.  Peart, 621  So.2d  780,  792  (La.  1993).  Even  if the  purpose  of the  argument  is  not to  set \naside  a  conviction,  “ineffectiveness”  by  definition  occurs  only  when  a public  defender’s  “‘acts  or \nomissions  were  outside  the  wide  range  of professionally  competent  assistance.”  Carter  v.  State, \n97-CA-01468,  1998  WL  906431,  at  *  3  (Miss.  App.  Dec.  30,  1998)  (quoting  Stickland  v. \nWashington,  466  U.S.  668,  690  (1984)).  Such  analysis  depends  on the  “facts  of the  particular \ncase.”  Id.  In  this  respect,  the  Board  is  seeking  a retrial  of 214  indigent defendants  to  argue  that \nthe  public  defenders  the  Board  hired  failed  to  adequately  prepare  for  the  examination  of \nwitnesses,  failed  to  file  motions  to  dismiss,  or failed  to  call  critical  witnesses.  See  State  Br.  at \n11.  Indeed,  no  authority  exists  for  such  en mass  retrials  of hundreds  of defendants.  See Wilson, \n347  So.2d  at  1340.  The  Board  could  not point to  a  single  court  which  has  allowed  such  an en \nmass  retrial  --  especially  when the  Board  professes  that  it  is  not  seeking  to  overturn  the \nconvictions  of any  of the  individual  defendants.  See  Quitman  Br.  at  17. \nFinally,  if the  Quitman Board  is  indeed  successful  and  establishes  that  its  failure to \nadequately  fund  public  defenders  resulted  in  one  or more  of the  214  indigent  defendants \nreceiving  ineffective  assistance  of counsel,  that  is  insufficient  as  a matter  of law  to  establish  that \nthe  statutes  requiring  counties to  assist  in public  defender  funding  are  unconstitutional.  See \nWilson,  574  So.2d at  1340;  Peart,  621  So.2d  at 787;  see also Hosford,  525  So.2d  at  798. \nTherefore,  the Quitman  Board’s  challenge  to  the  authority  of the  Legislature  to  determine \nthe  obligations  of counties,  as  subdivisions  and  agencies  of State  government,  should  be \ndismissed  and,  if indeed  statewide  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  were  to  exist,  this  Court  has \n4 \n \nthe  authority  to  review  such  as  a  challenge  by  a  specific  defendant  and  can  address  prospective \nremedies  therefrom. \nARGUMENT \n1.  In  2000,  the  Legislature  Created  State-Supported  Trial  and  Appellate  Public \nDef  ices  for  Capita  Vi  uch  Reguirements  Fr  ies, \nThe  Quitman  Board’s  assertion  that the  Legislature  is  unresponsive  to  their  financial  and \npolicy  arguments  is  without relevance  to  the  legal  arguments  raised  herein.  Importantly  though, \nthe  statements  are  simply  wrong.  Within the  past  year,  and  since  the  filing  of the  complaint, \nlegislation  fundamentally  altering  the  manner  in which public  defenders  are  funded  has  become \neffective.  See  State  Br.  at  5-7.  At  the time  the  complaint  was  filed,  counties  were  required to \nprovide  public  defenders  for county  residents  in  both  capital  and  non-capital  cases.  In 2000,  the \nLegislature  removed  from  counties  all  financial  responsibility  for providing  counsel  for trial, \ndirect  appeal  and post-conviction  review proceedings  in  all  capital  cases  by  creating  the \nMississippi  Office  of Capital  Defense  Counsel  and  the  Mississippi  Office  of Capital  Post- \nConviction  Counsel.  See generally,  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  99-18-1  (Supp.  2000);  99-39-101 \n(Supp.  2000). \nLegislature’s  actions were  consistent  with this  Court’s  statements  that  the  issue  of county \ninvolvement  in public  defender  funding  is  a  “legislative  matter rather  than  a judicial  matter.”  See \nWilson  v,  State,  574  So.2d  1338,  1341  (Miss.  1990);  Board of Sup’rs  of George  County  v. \nBailey,  236  So.2d  420,  422  (1970).  The  creation  of such  offices  was  also  consistent with this \n  \n \n|  | \nCourt’s  suggestion that the  Legislature  “review”  funding  of public  defenders in capital cases. \nSee  Mease  v,  State,  583  So.2d  1283,  1285  (Miss.  1991);  Quitman  Br.  at  1.7 \nIn  addition to  the  creation  of state-supported  offices  for  capital  representation,  the \nLegislature  established  the  Public  Defender  Task Force  to  monitor  the provision  of \nrepresentation  to  indigent  defendants  and  submit  annual  reports  to  the  Legislature.  See  Miss. \nCode  Ann.  §  99-18-1  (Supp.  2000);  2001  Miss.  Laws  Ch.  373  (HB  460).  Contrary  to  the \nassertions  of the  Board  and  various amici,  the  Legislature  has  not  “abandoned” public  defender \nfunding  to  the  counties.  Instead,  the  Board  is  properly  heard  to  complain  that the  Legislature \nfailed  to  adopt  its  suggested  policies  and  now  seeks judicial  implementation  of the  same. \nII.  The  Quitman  Board  Concedes  That  the  Complaint  Must  Be  Dismissed  If the  Legal \nand  Factual Allegations  Fail  to  Establish  “Beyond  All Reasonable  Doubt”  That  the \nhallenged  Constitutional  tatutory  Provisions  Are  “  titutional.” \nThe  Quitman  Board  recognizes  through  silence  the  heavy  burden  it  faces  in  attempting  to \ndeclare  “unconstitutional” all  constitutional  or  statutory  provisions  that require  counties  to  assist \nin  the  provision  of public  defenders  for their  residents.  See  State  Br.  at  17-19.  In  reviewing \nmotions  to  dismiss,  “legal  conclusions  or  allegations  of the  legal  effect  of events”  are  not  taken \nas  true  and  if such  legal  assertions  are  unsupported  the  complaint must  be  dismissed.  See Tucker \nv.  Hinds  County,  558  So.2d  869,  872  (Miss.  1990).  As  statutes  are  “clothed  with  a heavy \npresumption  of constitutional  validity,”  challengers  have  the  “very  heavy  burden”  of \n  \nAlthough  counsel  for  the  Quitman  Board  now  lambasts  such  reforms  in  capital  cases  as \nmeaningless,  this  Court  and  the  complaint note  otherwise.  The  complaint  alleged  that  the \nprovision  of defenders  in capital  cases  had  required  the  Board  to  raise  taxes  and  secure  a  loan. \nSee  Complaint  at 4  4.  Indeed,  in just  the time  since the  complaint  was  filed,  the  Legislature  has \nremoved  this  allegedly  “devastating”  responsibility  from  counties. \n6 \n \n“overcom{ing]  the  strong  presumption”  and  establishing  “beyond  all  reasonable  doubt”  that the \nstatutes  are  constitutional.  See  James  vy.  State,  731  So.2d  1135,  1136  (Miss.  1999);  State v. \nJones,  726  So.2d  572,  574  (Miss.  1998);  State  Br.  at  17-19.  The  “Court’s  duty  is  to  interpret the \nAct  and  envision facts  and  scenarios  in  which the  statute  could  be  held  constitutional.”  Jones, \n726  So.2d  at  573  (internal  citation omitted);  Wilson,  574  So.2d  at  1340  (applying  same  standard \nto  challenge  of public  defender  statutes). \nIll.  Counties,  as  Mere  Subdivisions  and  Agencies  of the  State,  Have  No  Cause  of \nAction  inst  *U  dM  tes”  or  “Overt  ensome”  Statutes \nInitially,  the  Quitman Board  and  amici  argue  that because  decisions  such  as Gideon v. \nWainwright,  372  U.S.  335  (1963),  described  the  right to  counsel  for  indigents  as  an  obligation  of \nthe  “States”  and  not  counties,  the  Legislature  is  thereby  constitutionally  prohibited  from \nrequiring  counties  to  assist  in  providing  public  defenders  for  its  citizens.  See  Quitman  Br.  at  14; \nSup’rs  Assoc.  at  6.  This  argument is  specious  to  the  point  of being  unbecoming  of  its  advocates. \nThe  Quitman  Board  fails  to  respond to the  numerous  decisions  of this  Court  firmly  holding  that \ncounties  exist  only  as  administrative  arms  of the  State  and  that  all  county  financial \nresponsibilities  are  in  fact  determined by  the  Legislature.  See  State  Br.  at  19-24;  Miss.  Code \nAnn.  §  19-3-41  (defining  responsibilities  of counties).  ~ \nA.  The  Constitution  Provides  Explicit  Authority  to  Require  Counties  to  Pay \nnd A  ses  Associated  Wi  riminal  Prosecutions, \nThe  Legislature  has  explicit  authority to  require  counties  to  spend  funds to  assist  with \npublic  defenders  pursuant  to  the  Constitution’s pronouncement that  “expenses  of criminal \n  \n \nprosecution  shall  be  borne  by  the  county.”*  Miss.  Const.  Art.  14,  Sect.  261.  See  State  Br.  at  19- \n21.  In response,  the  Board  argues  that this  provision  has  no  application to  the  cost  of “defense \ncounsel”  and,  as  a part  of the  1890  constitution,  it  is  trumped  by  the  “State’s  responsibility” \npronouncement  of Gideon.  See  Quitman  Br.  at  15-16.  However,  in Board  of Sup’rs  of George \nCounty  v.  Bailey,  this  Court effectively  rejected  both  such arguments.  In  Bailey,  this  Court \nstated  that,  pursuant  to  Art.  14,  Sec.  261  the  Legislature  had  the  authority  to  determine  whether \n“public  defenders”  are  “an  expense  in  criminal  prosecutions.”  236  So.2d  420,  422-23  (Miss. \n1970).°  Finally,  the Bailey court’s  deferral  to  the  Legislature  to  “implement”  Section  261  with \nrespect to  counties  and  public  defenders  was  decided  years  after Gideon  and,  in  fact,  refers  to \nsuch  decisions.  See id.  at  421. \nThe  Board  fails  to  cite  to  any  provision  of the  Mississipp1  Constitution  which  prohibits \nthe  Legislature  from requiring  counties  to  assist  in  funding  public  defenders  for  its  residents. \n  \n*  The  Board  does  not  argue,  and rightfully so,  that  because  the  Legislature  has  decided  to \ndefine  expenses  in  such  a manner  as to  remove  the  majority  of such  responsibility  from  counties \nthat  therefore,  the  Legislature  is  now constitutionally  prohibited  from  requiring  counties to  assist \nwith public  defenders. \n>  The  Board’s  assertion  that  in  Bailey the  court  “expressly  rejected” that  Section  261  provides \nthat  counties  may  be  required to  assist  with  public  defenders  reads  the  case  backwards.  The \nBailey  court  rejected  the  circuit  court’s  specific  decision  that  a public  defender  should  be  paid. \n$150  per  rape  case  and  $50 per  misdemeanor.  236  So.2d  at  421.  The  Court,  stating  that  the \njudiciary  could  not  order  such  specific  payments,  stated  that  Section  261  “requires  legislative \nimplementation  for  the  determination  of what  constitutes  proper  expenses,  the  amounts  thereof or \na  method of making  such  determination,  and  to  whom  same  should  be  paid.”  Id.  at 422. \n8 \n  \n \n: \nB.  The  Legislature  Has  Implicit Authority  to  Require  Counties,  as  State \nSubdivisions  and  I  Assist  i  nding  Publi  fenders. \nThe  Board  and  Supervisors Association’s  argument that  public  defenders  are  a  “State” \nand  not  a  “county”  responsibility  ignores  the  fundamental  and  unchallenged principle  that \ncounties  are  administrative  arms  of the  State.  See  State  Br.  at  21-24.  Counties  were  “created  by \nthe  Legislature  for political  and  civil  purposes  as  agencies  of the  state  government”  and  as  a mere \n“subdivision  of the  state,  created  for  administration  and  other public  purposes,  and  owes  its \ncreation to  the  state,  it  is  a rule that  it  is  subject  at  all  times  to  legislative  contro!  and  change.” \nState  v.  Board  of  Sup’rs  of Grenada  County,  105  So.  541,  546  (Miss.  1925)  (citation  omitted, \nemphasis  supplied);  see also  Hinds County,  635  So.2d  at  845  (rejecting  argument  that  the \nresponsibility  of housing  state  inmates  is an  “obligation  of the  State  as  a whole”  and  not \ncounties). \nThe  Board next  contends  that  requiring  counties  to  fund  public  defenders  in  non-capital \ncases  is  an  unfunded  mandate  which takes  away  from  “other  responsibilities”  of counties.  See \nComplaint  at {  22(a);  Quitman  Br.  at  7;  Sup’rs  Assoc.  at  5.  However,  it  is  the  Legislature  which \ndecides  what  governmental  functions  counties  must provide.  See  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  19-3-41 \n(defining  responsibilities  of counties);  see also Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  23-15-227  (counties  pay \nelection  officials  for  state  elections);  23-15-355  (counties  provide  ballots  for  elections);  25-3-9 \n(counties  pay  county  prosecuting  attorneys);  9-7-126  (counties  compensate  deputy  circuit \nclerks).°  As this  Court has  explained,  “[t]he  revenues  of a  county  are  subject to  the  control  of \n  \n°The  Supervisors  Association  argues  that this  Court  should  create  a  new constitutional \nrequirement  that  would  prohibit  the  Legislature  from passing  “less  important  funding \nresponsibilities  to  the  counties”  so  that  country  treasuries  will  not  be  “depleted.”  Sup’rs  Assoc. \n9 \n  \n \nthe  Legislature,  and  when  the  Legislature  directs  their  application to  a particular purpose  or to  the \npayment  of the  claims  of particular  parties,  the  obligation  to  so  pay  ts  thereby  imposed  on the \ncounty.”  Jackson  County  v.  Neville,  95  So.  626,  628  (Miss.  1932)  (cited  approvingly  in  Hinds \nCounty,  635  So.2d  at  843).’  The  Board’s  and  Supervisor  Association’s  call  to  this  Court  to \ndeclare  this  and  all  other  “of the  Legislature’s  unfunded  mandates”  unconstitutional  is  clearly \ncontrary  to  law  and,  indeed,  bad  policy  itself.  See  Sup’rs  Assoc..  at  6,  8. \nThe  Board  fails  to  cite  to  any  provision  of the  Mississippi  Constitution  which  prohibits \nthe  Legislature  from  determining  the  obligations  of counties  or  imposing  “unfunded  mandates.” \nC.  As  Between  the  State  and  Its  Political  Subdivisions,  Decisions  as  to  Whether \nounti  ist  i  ding  Public  Defenders  Is  islative  Matter, \nCut  to  its  core,  the  Board  and  amici  seek  a judicial  determination that  the  Legislature  has \nmisjudged  the  resources  of its  “political  subdivision”  counties  and  that  the  Legislature  has \nimposed  a  “too  heavy”  (and  therefore,  unconstitutional)  financial  burden  on  counties. \nRecognizing  that  a  county  may not  sue  the  State  to  have  its  statutory  responsibilities  declared \n“too  financial  burdensome,” the  Board  badly  misframes  its  argument  as  a  “constitutional” \nchallenge.  This  Court  has  previously  recognized that policy  arguments  mislabeled  as \n  \nat  5.  Obviously,  such  an  argument  directly conflicts  with  the  role  of counties  as  administrative \narms  of the  State  “subject  at  all  times to  legislative  control  and  change.”  Grenada  County,  105 \nSo.  at  546. \n”  The  Quitman Board  and  amici  Chamber  of Commerce  argue  that  requiring  counties  to  fund \npublic  defenders  in  non-capital  cases  results  in  “unequal  tax  burdens”  and  a  system  in  which \ncounties  must pay  to  house  “State”  inmates  awaiting  “delayed”  trials.  See  Quitman  Br.  at  7; \nComplaint  at  4] 22(b),  22(e);  Chamber  at 4.  However,  as  set  forth  in the  State’s  initial  brief, \nboth  such  arguments  were  rejected  by  this  Court  in  State  v.  Hinds  County  Bd,  of Sup’rs,  635 \nSo.2d  839  (Miss.  1994)  (affirming  dismissal  of complaint).  See  State  Br.  at  23-24. \nLO\n“constitutional  challenges”  fail  as  a matter  of law.  As  this  Court  has  instructed: \nIn determining  whether  an  act  of the  Legislature  violates  the  Constitution,  the \ncourts  are  without  the  right  to  substitute  their judgment  for that  of the  Legislature \nas  to  the  wisdom  and  policy  of the  act  and  must  enforce  it,  unless  it  appears \nbeyond  all  reasonable  doubt  to  violate  the  Constitution.  Nor  are  the  courts  at \nliberty  to  declare  an  Act  (of the  Legislature)  void,  because  in their opinion  it  1s \nopposed  to  a  spirit  supposed  to  prevail  the  Constitution,  but not  the  expressed \nwords, \nPathfinder  Coach  Division  v.  Cottrell,  62  So.2d  383,  385  (Miss.  1953). \nThe  Quitman  Board,  unable  to  met  the  argument  squarely,  misstates  the  State’s  position \nas  one  of advocating  “complete  immunity  from judicial  review”  for  arguments  of ineffective \nassistance  of counsel.  See  Quitman  Br.  at  11.  To  the  contrary,  the  State’s  position  is  that  this \nCourt,  and  all  other  courts  cited  by the  Board,  have  repeatedly  held  that  --  as  to  the  economic \nrelationship  between the  State  and  its  subdivision counties  --  Legislative policy  decisions  are  not \nsubject  to judicial  policy  review.  This  fundamental  element  of the  separation  of powers  doctrine \nholds  true  even  with  respect to  generalized  claims  of  ineffective  assistance  of counsel.  As this \nCourt  stated  in  the public  defender  constitutional  challenge  case  of Wilson,  “{a}lthough we \nrecognize  our  inherent  authority  to  provide  counsel  for indigents,  we  refused  to  interfere  with  the \nLegislature’s  right  to  expend  public  funds.”  574  So.2d  at  1340. \nThe  Quitman  Board  cites  this  Court’s  Hosford  decision  as  the  guiding  principle  for  the \nrole  of the judiciary  in  this  State/county  dispute;  the  State  agrees.  Hosford v,  State,  525  So.2d \n789  (Miss.  1988);  Quitman  Br.  at  11.  In  Hosford,  the  county  courthouse  was  in  such  a  state  of \ndisrepair that  it  interfered  with the  administration of justice.  Id.  at  797.  By  statute,  the \nLegislature  requires  counties  to  “erect  and  keep  in  good  repair”  courthouses.  Id.  The  trial  court \nset  forth  on  the  record  that  it  had  requested  the  board  of supervisors  to  repair  the  courthouse  but \n11 \n  \n \nthe  board  responded that  “they  don’t  have  the  money.”  Id.  at  796.  The  trial  court  further  stated \nthat  it  was  “convinced  of that  due  to  the  financial  condition  of the  County[,]  [i]t’s  impossible  for \nthem  to  spend the  money  that  it would  take  to  correct  this  situation.”  Id. \nIn  a clear rejection  of the  Board’s  arguments,  the  Hosford court  did  not  order  a  hearing  on \nwhether the  burden placed  on the  county  by  the  Legislature  was  “too  financially  burdensome” \neven though  the  trial  court  was  “convinced”  of the  county’s  financial  inability.  Instead,  this \nCourt reiterated that  the  Mississippi  Code  “authorizes the  boards  of supervisors  to  levy  taxes \nnecessary  to  meet the  demands  of their  counties”  and  the  Code  further  creates  “a  clear  statutory \nduty  of a  board  of supervisors  to  provide  adequate  court  facilities.”  Id.  at  797.  In  explicit \nlanguage  which  requires  dismissal  of the  complaint,  this  Court  held that  “{i]t  follows,  of course, \nthat  county  boards  of supervisors,  which  have  imposed  upon them the  statutory  duty  of \nfurnishing  adequate  courtroom  facilities,  are  subject to  appropriate  court  orders  requiring  them  to \ndo  so  when  they  adamantly  fai]  or  refuse to  do  so.”  Id.  at  798  (emphasis  supplied);  accord  Sup’rs \nAssoc.  at  9  (conceding  that “if the  county  refused  to  provide  any  legal  counsel  to  the  indigent \ndefendant,  it  would  be  sued  and  found  liable’’).® \n  \n*  The  Mississippi  Bar,  in this  respect,  correctly  reads  Hosford  and  Wilson  to  leave  open the \nability  of Courts to  ensure  that they  “do  not  atrophy.”  Miss.  Bar  at  1-2.  However,  the  Bar \nmisapplies  the principle.  Although  such  is  not the  case,  if indeed  a  lack  of public  defender \nfunding  in  non-capital  cases  by  counties  was  threatening  the  existence  of the judiciary,  the  action \nof this  Court  is  properly  an  order  to  the  Board  that  it must  comply the  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  25- \n32-1,  19-3-41  and  properly  fund  non-capital public  defenders.  See  Hosford,  525  So.2d  at  798. \nFinally,  the  Bar’s  statement that this  Court  need  not decide  at  this  point  what  relief is  appropriate \nis  a  tacit  confession  that  the  relief prayed  for  by  the  Board  (to  declare  all  county  public  defender \nfunding  statutes  unconstitutional  and  order  a  state-supported program)  has  been previously \nrejected  by  this  Court  and  by  all  other courts  cited by  the  Board.  See  Wilson,  574  So.2d  at  1340; \nState  v.  Peart,  621  So.2d  780  (La.  1993), \n12 \n  \n \nAs  more  fully  set  forth  in the  State’s  initial  brief,  the  pronouncements  of this  Court  in \nHosford are  consistent  with  both prior  and  subsequent  decisions  which  refuse  to  utilize  the \ndoctrine  of ineffective  assistance  of counsel  to  strike  down  public  defender  statutes  or  order  the \njudicial  creation  of new  state-supported  programs.  See  Young  v.  State,  255  So.2d  318,  321-322 \n(Miss,  1971);  Wilson,  574  So.2d  at  1340;  State  Br.  at 25-27.%  Indeed,  with respect to  the  Article \n3,  Section 26  “effective  assistance  of counsel”  claims  raised  by both the  Quitman Board  and  the \nWilson indigent  defendant,  the  challenge  raised  by  the  Wilson  defendant  was  much  more  serious \nand  yet  this  Court  reiterated  that the  Legislature  is the  proper  branch to  determine  the  method  for \ncompensating  public  defenders.  See  State  Br.  at  26-27. \nUndaunted  by the  holdings  of this  Court  in  Hosford,  Wilson,  and Young,  the  Quitman \nBoard  next  draws  this  Court’s  attention to  the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in State v. \nPeart,  621  So.2d  780  (La.  1993)  in support  of its  sweeping  constitutional  challenge  to  the  public \ndefender  statutes.  Quitman  Br.  at  20.  Remarkably,  the  Peart  court  also  explicitly  rejected the \narguments  raised  by  the  Board.  The  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  (reversing  the  trial  court’s  finding \nof an “unconstitutional” public  defender  system  and  order to  the  Legislature  to  fund  all public \ndefenders)  stated: \n“We  find  that  [statutes  directing  county  and  city  level  funding  of public \n  \n*  In this  respect,  amici  have  also  argued  that the  creation  of a  statewide,  state-supported \noffice  of public  defender  to  handle  all  indigent  representation  would  conserve  State  resources  and \n“secure  an  economic  future  for  Quitman  County.”  See Fortenberry  at  8;  Chamber  of Commerce \nat  1;  Sheriffs  at  3.  These  are  indeed  legitimate  viewpoints  in  the  Legislative  policy  debate  over \nthe  most  efficient  manner  in which  to  provide  public  defenders.  However,  as  is  evident  to  all \ninvolved,  these  arguments  do  not  support  a finding  that  the  Legislature’s  requirement  that \ncounties  assist with public  defender  funding  is  “unconstitutional.” \n13 \n      \ndefenders]  do  not  unconstitutionally  burden the  state’s  political  subdivisions  by \nrequiring that  they  fund  the  indigent  defender  system.  While  the  district  court \nmight  question  the  wisdom  of this  means  of funding,  the  statutes  themselves  are \nnot  unconstitutional.” \n621  So.2d  at  782,  787;  see  also Jewell  v.  Maynard,  383  S.E.2d  536,  545,  547  (W.Va.  1989) \n(cited  at  Quitman  Br.  at  20)  (rejecting  request  to  “adopt  statewide  public  defender  system”); \nState v. Smith,  681  P.2d  1374,  1383  (Ariz,  1984)  (cited  at  Quitman  Br.  at  20)  (rejecting \nstatewide  “uniform  system”  given the  State’s  “political  subdivisions  of widely  varying \npopulation,  geography,  customs  and  problems”);  Mav.d Towdnshiep ofn Delr an, 601  A.2d  211, \n222  (N.J.  1992)  (cited  at  Quitman  Br.  at  20)  (holding that  Court’s  balancing  of burdens  between \ncounties  and  State  with  respect  to  public  defenders  would  be an  incursion  into  “an  area  ordinarily \nreserved  to  the  Legislature  and the  Executive  and presumptively  better  left  there”).  Indeed,  each \nand  every  decision  cited  by  the  parties  in  which  a court  has  considered  the  argument  as  to \nwhether  it  is  “unconstitutional”  for  a  legislature  to  require  counties  to  fund public  defenders  has \nconcluded that the  Board’s  arguments  have  no  foundation  in  law. \nD.  As  the  Legislature  Has  the  Unquestioned  Authority  to  Require  Counties  to \nExpend  Funds  For Public  Defenders,  the  Board’s  “Ineffectiveness” \nment  Fai  a  Matter  o  nd  t  ase  Shouid  Be  Dismissed \nAs  it  is  absolutely  clear  that  “[t]he  revenues  of a  county  are  subject to  the  control  of the \nLegislature,  and  when the  Legislature  directs  their  application  to  a particular purpose  or  to  the \npayment  of the  claims  of particular parties,  the  obligation to  so  pay  is  thereby  imposed  on  the \ncounty,”  the  Board has  no  legal  theory  by  which to  challenge  the  public  defender  statutes  as  “too \nburdensome”  or to  argue  that  it  “cannot  afford”  to  abide  thereby.  See Jackson  County,  95  So.2d \nat  628;  Hinds  County,  635  So.2d  at  843. \n14 \n \nIn  this  respect,  the  Board  is  foreclosed  from  arguing  that  its  failure  to  fulfill  its  statutory \nobligation  has  created  an  “ineffective assistance”  crisis  entitling  it  to  seek to  declare  the  public \ndefender  statutes  unconstitutional.  Indeed,  even  if the  Board  was  correct  that  such  a  statewide \nineffective  assistance  crisis  exists,  the  proper  resolution  of the  complaint  would  be,  as  this  Court \nset  forth  in Hosford,  an  order requiring the  Board  to  “levy  such taxes  as  may  be  necessary  to \nmeet  the  demands”  imposed  on  it  as  a  political  subdivision  and  agency  of the  State.  See  Miss. \nCode Ann.  §  19-3-41.  “It  follows,  of course,  that  county  boards  of supervisors,  which have \nimposed  upon  them the  statutory  duty  of furnishing  adequate  courtroom  facilities,  are  subject  to \nappropriate  court  orders  requiring  them  to  do  so  when  they  adamantly  fail  or  refuse  to  do  so.” \nHosford,  525  So.2d  at  798  (emphasis  supplied);  see also  Grant  v.  State,  686  So.2d  1078,  1090 \n(Miss.  1996)  (“the  constitutionality  of state  enactments  are  not  to  be  reached  if the  case  can  be \nresolved  upon  other  grounds”). \nIV.  The  Quitman  Board  Cannot  Raise  “Ineffective  Assistance  of Counsel”  to  Assail  the \nConstitutionality of the Public  Defender  System. \nImplicitly  recognizing that  the  Legislature  has  the  unquestionable  authority  to  require  a \ncounty  to  expend funds  on  programs  for  county  residents,  the  Quitman Board  is  left  to  bastardize \nthe  doctrine  of “ineffective  assistance  of counsel”  to  such  an  extent  that  it  becomes  almost \nunrecognizable.  Indeed,  neither  the  Quitman Board  nor the  amici have  cited  any  authority  for  the \nproposition  that  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  may  be  raised  by  anyone  other  than  an  indigent \ndefendant  or  in  the manner utilized  by  the  Board. \nFirst  and  foremost,  Quitman concedes  that  it  cannot and  does  not  seek  relief on  behalf of, \nnor does  it  assert  the  constitutional  rights  of,  any  former or  future  individual  indigent  defendants. \n15 \n \nSee  Quitman  Br.  at  17.  Instead,  it  seeks  to  utilize  the  doctrine  of ineffective  assistance  of counsel \nto  relieve  itself of “the  intolerable  burden”  of funding  public  defenders.  Quitman  Br.  at  17. \nThe  Quitman  Board’s  disfigured  ineffective  assistance  arguments  is  as  follows.  First,  the \nState  must  ensure  that  public  defenders  are  provided.  Second,  the  Legislature  has  required  that \ncounties  assist  in  the  provision  of public  defenders  by  funding  such  in  non-capital  cases.  Next, \nthe  Board  asserts  that  it  has  failed  to  fulfill  its  statutory  obligation  and  has  underfunded  its  public \ndefenders.  The  Board  now  attempts  to  invoke  the  individual  constitutional  right  to  counsel  and \nsue  the  State  on  behalf of taxpayers  —  not  on  behalf of the  indigent  defendants  —  seeking  a \njudicial  determination  that  the  county’s  own  failure  to  abide  by  statutes  has  created  “systemic  | \nineffective  assistance  of counsel”  entitling the  county,  but not  any  indigent  defendants,  to  relief. \nSee Quitman  Br.  at  15.  The  doctrine  of ineffective  assistance  of counsel  does  not  support  the \nunwieldy  and  disfigured  arguments  placed  upon  it  by  the  Board  and  the  complaint  is  properly \nsubject  to  dismissal. \nA,  The  Board  Concedes That  Its  Actions  in  Implementing  the  Statues  Have \nCreated  the  Alleged  “Systemic  Ineffective  Assistance.” \n  \nThe  Quitman  Board  concedes  that  in  1990  the  board passed  by unanimous  vote  a \nresolution  which:  (1)  determined  that  two  part-time  public  defenders  were  sufficient  to  serve the \nneeds  of its  citizens,  (2)  determined  that the  two  part-time  public  defenders  should  be  hired  on  a \nflat-fee  contract  basis,  (3)  hired  Alan  Shackelford  and  Thomas  Pearson  as  the  county  public \ndefenders,  and  (4)  established  the  salaries  of the  public  defenders.  See  August  6,  1990  Legal \nRepresentation  for  Indigent  Defendants  Resolution  at  €{  1,5,6  (R.E.7;R.1629-30);  State  Br.  at  7- \né \n9,  28-30.  The  Quitman  Board  further  concedes  that the  Legislature  has  provided  the  Board  with \n16\ndiscretion  as  to  the  manner  in  which  to  provide  public  defenders,  authorized  the  Board  to \nperform  any  additional  tasks  “necessary”  to provide  “adequate  legal  defense  for  indigent \npersons,”  and  empowered  boards  to  “Jevy  taxes  necessary  to  meet  the  demands  of their \ncounties.”  See  State  Br.  at  6-7;  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  25-32-1,  19-3-41.  There  is  simply  no  legal \ntheory  which  supports  the  Board’s  ability  to  allegedly  underfund,  improperly  contract  for,  and \nhire  incompetent  public  defenders  and  then  sue  the  State  arguing  that  the  actions  of the  Board \nhave  infringed  on  the  constitutional  rights  of Quitman  residents.  See  State  Br.  at  28-30. \nIn  response,  the  Quitman Board  cites  Hosford for  this  Court’s  authority  to  order  that \nfunds  be  furnished  and  then  argues  that  it  is  entitled  to  declare  county  funding  “unconstitutional” \nbecause  it  “cannot  afford  to”  abide  by  the  statute  and  “if a county  refused to  provide  and  fund  a \nsystem  of indigent  defense  —  either  because  of financial  bankruptcy  or  other reasons  — the  duty \nwould unquestionably  fall  to  the  State.”  Quitman Br.  at  11,  15,  17.  As  discussed  above,  the \nHosford  Court  quartered  no  such argument.  Instead,  this  Court  reiterated  that  counties  must \nfulfill  the  statutory  obligations  imposed  on  them  by  the  Legislature  and  the  Board  is  subject  to \n_  “appropriate  court  orders  requiring  them  to  do  so  when they adamantly  fail  or  refuse  to  do  so.” \n525  So.2d  at  789  (emphasis  supplied).'° \nB.  The  Quitman  Board  Lacks  Standing  to  Assert the Individual  Right  to \nCounsel  on  Behalf of 214  Previously  Tried  Indigent  Defendants  or on \nBehalf  of  uture  Indigent  Crimi  ants. \n  \n'°  Moreover,  if it  is  legally  possible  for  a county  to  fail  to  fulfill  its  public  defender  obligation \nand then  seek  relief from  the  State  under  “ineffective  assistance,”  such  a  doctrine  would  create  an \nincentive  for  the  county  to  completely  “refuse  to provide  and  fund” public  defenders  so  that the \nBoard  could  easily  prove  that  indigent  defendants  were  unquestionably  denied  the  right  to \ncounsel. \n17 \n  \n \nThe  Quitman  Board  does  not  dispute that  it  does  not  have  a  “right  to  counsel”  which  is  at \nstake  in this  litigation.  Moreover,  after  the  State  argues  that  the  Board  lacks  standing  to  assert \nthe  individual]  constitutional  nght  to  counsel  of hundreds  of former  and  future  indigent \ndefendants,  the  Board  confesses  such  by  stating  that  it  is  not  seeking  to  assert  such  rights  or \nseeking  relief (in  the  form  of retrials)  for  any  individua]  defendants.  See  Quitman  Br.  at  17. \nIndeed,  the  Board  is  only  seeking  relief for  itself.  See  id.  The  Board’s  wily  dodge  creates  more \nproblems  for  the  Board than  it  solves.  The  Board  admits  that  it  does  not have  a  right  to  counsel, \nand then  it  states  that  it  is  not  asserting  the  rights of any  individual  defendants.  The  issue  is: \nWho’s  individual  constitutional  nght  to  counsel  is  at  issue?  The  Board  cannot  argue  that  it  has \nstanding  to  assert  the  constitutional  rights  of indigent defendants  for  the  benefit  of the  County \nwhile  at  the  same  time  stating  that will  not  seek  relief for  those  defendants  whose  rights  it \nasserts.  The  Board  is  indeed  perplexed.  It  cannot  rest  on  general  allegations  of “underfunding” \nto  establish  ineffective  assistance.  However,  at  the  same  time,  it  does  not want  to  argue that \nspecific  individuals  were  denied  their  right  to  counsel  because  such  would  require a retrial  for \nthose  individuals.  The  Board’s  attempted  middle  position is  unsupportable. \nThe  State  does  agree  that  counties have  standing  to  initiate  litigation  over  items  such as \nthe  alteration  of its  boundaries  through  annexation and  standing  to  initiate  actions  on  behalf of \ntaxpayers.  See Harrison County v. City of Gulfport,  557  So.2d  780  (Miss.  1990).  However, \nwith respect  to  the  individual  constitutional  right  to  counsel,  “no  court  .  .  .  has  ever  held  that the \nSixth  Amendment  protects  anyone  other  than  criminal  defendants.”  Portman  v.County  of Santa \n18 \n  \n \nClara,  995  F.2d  898  (9\"  Cir.  1993);  accord  Kinoy  v.  Mithcell,  851  F.2d  591  (2d  Cir.  1988).\"' \nC.  The  Quitman  Board’s Constitutional  Challenge  to  the  Public  Defender \nStatutes  By  Means  of a  Generalized  Assertion  of Inadequate  Funding  Is \nontrary  to  the  Clear  Prec  of This  Court. \nCiting  the  decisions  of this  Court,  the  State  argued  in  its  initial  brief that the  Board’s \ngeneralized  assertion  of “underfunding”  as  an  argument  for  declaring  public  defender funding \nstatutes  unconstitutional  has  been  rejected  by  this  Court.  See  State  Br.  at  34-36.  In response,  the \nQuitman Board  again  commits  the  error of exaggeration,  mischaracterizing  the  State’s  position \nas  an argument that  no  “prospective”  relief is  available  with  respect  to the  right to  counsel.  See \nQuitman Br.  at  19;  Van  Slyke  at  7.  This  is  easily  addressed:  prospective  relief is  available.  The \nBoard  misses  the  State’s  two  crucial  arguments.  First,  claims  of  “ineffective assistance”  (upon \nwhich  prospective  relief may  rest)  must  be  evaluated  on  a case  by  case  basis  examining  the  facts \nof particular  indigent  criminal  defendants.  In this  respect,  the  complaint’s  assertion  that  “poor \nfunding”  and  “lack  of oversight”  means  that  “constitutional  requirements  for the  effective \nassistance  of counsel  often  are  not met”  is  the  type  of generalized  argument  that  is  insufficient  as \na  matter  of law to  state  a  claim  of ineffective  assistance  of counsel  as  this  Court,  and  every  court \ncited  by  the  Board,  requires  ineffectiveness  claims to  be  reviewed  on a  case  by  case  basis. \nIndeed,  former public  defender  Van  Slyke  admits  such  when  he  states  “[e]xcept  for  cases \ninvolving  attorney  ineffectiveness,”  courts  allow  generalized  assertions  regarding  individual \n  \n'!  Moreover,  the  Board  has  failed  to  find  a  decision  in  this jurisdiction  or  elsewhere  in \nwhich  anyone  other than  criminal  defendants  or their  attorneys  have  been  found  to  have  standing \nto  assert  the  right  to  counsel.  In  contrast,  the  State  has  cited  numerous  authorities  rejecting  the \nability  of litigants to  assert  other  individual’s  right  to  counsel.  See  State  Br.  at  32. \n19 \n  \n \nrights.'?  Van  Slyke  at  8. \nSecond,  as  this  Court  found  in  Wilson,  (a capital  case  involving  public  defenders)  a \ngeneralized  claim  of “systemic”  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  is  insufficient,  as  a matter  of \nlaw,  to  strike  down  public  defender  funding  statutes  as  unconstitutional. \nWhile  we  do  have the  authority  to  override  the  Legislature  in  cases  of absolute \nnecessity,  we  have  previously  held that  the  issue  of compensation  for  an  attorney \nappointed  to  defend  an  accused  in  a criminal  case  is  a  legislative  matter  rather \nthan  a judicial  matter. \nThe  argument  concerning  the  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  is  a  matter that  is \nbetter decided  on  a  case  by  case  basis.  As  one  court  has  held,  those  rare  cases \nwhere  counsel  has  been  ineffective  may  be  handled  and  determined  individually \nby  the  appellate  courts  and just  because  the  limitation  could  have  such  a  result  is \nno  reason  to  declare  it  unconstitutional. \n547  So.2d  at  1341  (internal  quotations  and  citations  omitted).  The  Wilson  court’s  skepticism  for \nstriking  down  a  single  statute  as  unconstitutional  on  a  generalized  ineffective  assistance  of \ncounsel  argument  is  even  more  appropriate  regarding  the  Quitman  Board’s  attempt to  declare  an \nentire type  of public  defender system  --  any  system  in which  counties  assist in  funding \nrepresentation  --  unconstitutional. \nFurther  detached  from  constitutional  support are  the  arguments  of the  various  amici  that  a \nstate-supported,  statewide,  full-time  office  of public  defender  is  in  fact  mandated  by  the  doctrine \n  \n'2  The  untested  assertions  of former  public  defender  J.B.  Van  Slyke  regarding  his \ncaseload  are  pending  in  separate  suit  filed  against the  Forrest  County  Board  of Supervisors  and \nthe  State  asserting  that his  performance  as  a public  defender  was  sufficiently poor  as  to  deny  his \nclients  the  right to  counsel.  See  State  Br.  at  2,  Although  the  Van  Slyke  case  has  not  been \nlitigated,  such  a  case  is  marginally  more  appropriate  than  the  challenge  by the  Quitman  Board  as \nthe  Van  Slyke  plaintiff is  a public  defender  and the  plaintiff has  properly  named  the  board  of \nsupervisors  as  a  party.  The  Van  Slyke  case  may  present  a  better  avenue  in  which  to  consider \nwhether  counties  are  abiding  by  the  Mississippi  Code. \n20 \n  \n \nof ineffective  assistance  because  such  an  office  would  “increase  the  dependability  of the  criminal \njustice  system.”  See e.g,  Fortenberry  at  [;  Sheriffs  at  1.  However,  neither  the  amici  nor  the \nBoard  have  uncovered  a  court  which  has  found  such to  be  constitutionally  mandated  or  a  court \nwhich has  ordered  the  creation  of such.  Indeed,  in  the  decisions  cited  by  the  Board  in  footnote  6, \ncourts  have  upheld  the  constitutionality  of local  appointment  regimes  in  which  the  appointed \ndefender  is  not  compensated  at  all.  See TMadoden wv. nshiof Dpelra n, 601  A.2d  211,  215  (N.J. \n1992)  (“Even  accepting that  in  general,  a  system  of paid  counsel  .  .  .  results  in  better \nrepresentation  than  that  provided  by pro bono  counsel,  such  a  showing  does  not  equate  with  a \nconstitutional  denial  of counsel.”). \nMoreover,  as  to  the  cases  cited  by  the  Board  for the  proposition that  generalized \narguments  about  “funding”  and  “lack  of state  oversight”  may  serve  as  a  basis  for  declaring  the \npublic  defender  statutes  unconstitutional,  none  of the  cases  cited  support  such  arguments  and \nmany  such  cited  cases  explicitly  reject the  same.  See  Quitman  Br.  at  20.  Initially,  the  Board \ncites  State  v.  Peart,  621  So.2d  780  (La.  1993).  Unlike  the  case  at  bar,  in  Peart,  an  individual \nindigent  defendant  asserted that  his  right to  counsel  had been  and  continued  to  be  compromised \nby  the  specific  actions  of a  Louisiana public  defender.  Id.  at  788.  The Louisiana  Supreme  Court, \nreversed the  trial  court’s  finding  of “systemic  ineffective  assistance”  and  its  order that  “the \nlegislature  allocate  funds  for  additional  staff.”  621  So.2d  at  784,  792.  The  court  stated: \nWe  begin  with  the  proposition  that because  there  is  no  precise  definition  of \nreasonably  effective  assistance  of counsel,  any  inquiry  into  the  effectiveness  of \ncounsel  must  necessarily  be  individualized  and  fact-driven.  See  Strickland  .... \n{TyThe  true  inquiry  is  whether  an  individual  defendant has  been  provided  with \nreasonably  effective  assistance,  and  no  general  finding  by  the trial  court  regarding \na  given  lawyer’s  handling  of other  cases,  or  workload  generally,  can answer  that \n21 \n     \nvery  specific  question  as  to  an individual  defendant  and the  defense  being \nfurnished  him. \nWe  find  that  a determination  of effectiveness  of counsel  requires  that  the  trial \ncourt examine  each  case  individually. \n621  So.2d  at  788  (emphasis  supplied).  Indeed,  Peart,  far  from  supporting  a  “systemic”  and \ngeneralized  view  of ineffective  assistance  of counsel,  supports  the  dismissal  of the  Quitman \nBoard’s  complaint.  According  to  Louisiana courts,  “Peart  stands  for  the  proposition  that  each \nclaim  of ineffectiveness  must  be  evaluated  on an  individual}  basis.”  State  v.  Hughes,  653  So.2d \n748,  751  (La.App.  1995);  cf.  Lucky  v.  Harris,  860  F.2d  1012,  1018  (11  Cir,  1988),  rev’d  on  other \ngrounds,  Lucky  v.  Miller,  976  F.2d  673  (11\"  Cir.  1992)  (specific  indigent  defendants  may \nchallenge  public  defender  statutes  as  applied  specifically  to  them);  Gardner  v,  Luckey,  500  F.2d \n712,  714-15  Gth  Cir,  1974)  (dismissing public  defender  challenge  as  arguments  on  behalf of past \nindigent  defendants  should  be  handled  in  the  “appeals  proceedings”  and  challenges  as  to  future \nindigent  defendants  was  too  speculative  given the  fact  specific  nature  of ineffective  assistance  of \ncounsel).'?  The  remaining  cases  cited  on page  20  of the  Quitman  Brief are  immaterial  as  they  do \nnot  apply  the  doctrine  of “ineffective  assistance  of counsel.” \nV.  Each  Alleged  “Type”  of Ineffectiveness  Cited  By  The  Board  May  Be  Raised  By \nDefendants  Before,  After,  or During  Trial  and  Has  Been  Subject  To  Extensive \nReview  By  This  And  Other  State  Courts. \n  \n  \n3  The  Board  also  cites  to  State  ex rel.  Stephan  v.  Smith,  747  P.2d  816  (Kan.  1987). \nSee  Quitman  Br.  at  20  n.6.  However,  the  Kansas  court,  in  language  adopted by  this  Court  in \nWilson,  rejected  the  “systemic”  arguments.  “Simply  because  the  system  could  result  in  the \nappointment  of ineffective  counsel  is  not  sufficient  reason  to  declare  the  system unconstitutional; \nthose  rare  cases  where  counsel has  been  ineffective  may  be  handled  and  determined  individually \nby  the  appellate  courts.”  Id.  at  831. \n22 \n  \n \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  the  State  and the  Quitman  County  public  defenders  vigorously \n_  deny  the  Board’s  allegation  that  every  indigent defendant  in the  county  received  ineffective \nassistance.  See  State  Br.  at  28.  Indeed,  the  Quitman  County  public  defenders,  the  very  persons \nthe Board  allegedly  underfunded  and  denied  resources  to,  have  both  testified  that  no  indigent \ncriminal  defendants  in  Quitman  County  received  ineffective  assistance  of counsel.  See  State  Br. \nat  28.  The  Board  cites  to  no  case  in  which  a  Quitman  County  indigent  defendant  was found  to \nhave  received  ineffective  assistance. \nMoreover,  there  is  no  dispute  that  the  Quitman  County  public  defenders  are  not \noverworked.  In  1999,  one  defender  had  been  assigned  to just  fourteen  (14)  cases  and  the  other \nmerely  nineteen  (19)  cases.  See  State  Br.  at  8.  Neither  are  they  denied  appropriate \ncompensation.  Taking  Quitman  public  defender  Thomas  Pearson  as  an  example,  Mr.  Pearson \nwas  assigned  to  156  cases  over  six years  (1995-2000),  See  Quitman Br.  at  28,  n.12.  This  is  an \naverage  of 26  cases per  year.  Mr.  Pearson  was  paid  $1,350  per month  ($16,200  per  year)  by  the \nBoard.  Id.  Dividing  his  yearly  compensation  into  the  cases  handled  per year,  Mr.  Pearson  was \ncompensated  $624  per  case.  Additionally,  if you  exclude the  cases  for  which Mr.  Pearson \nentered  guilty  pleas  (63  cases  over  six year),  Mr.  Pearson  was  paid  $1,045  per  case.  Mr. \nPearson’s  compensation  could  not have  resulted  in  systemic  ineffective  assistance  of counsel. \nHowever,  if indeed  the  system  in  Quitman  County  was  so  flawed  as  to  have  denied  the \nright  to  counsel  of each  indigent  criminal  defendant  since  1995,  such  flaws  could  be  challenged \nby  individual  defendants  (before,  during,  or  after  trial)  and  this  Court  could,  upon  such  a  specific \nchallenge,  fashion  prospective  relief for  all  similarly  situated  defendants.  See  Wilson,  575  So.2d \nat  1340;  Jackson  v.  State,  732  So.2d  187  (Miss.  1999).  The  Quitman  Board  asserts  that the \n23 \n   \n“nature  of the  particular  claims brought  here  do  not  lend  themselves”  to  challenges  by  individual \ndefendants.  See  Quitman  Br.  at  21;  see also Van  Slyke  at  12.  However,  each  of the  allegations \nof ineffectiveness  raised  by  the  Board  has  been,  and  will  continue  to  be,  challenged  by  individual \ncriminal  defendants  and  presented to  this  Court.  See Quitman  Br.  at  21.'  Challenges  by \nindividuals  are,  in  fact,  the  proper  method  by  which to  correct  constitutional  deficiencies  and \nerrors. \nFinally,  this  Court’s  requirement  that questions  of ineffective  assistance  of counsel  must \nbe  reviewed  on  a case  by  case  review  is  rooted  in  the  very  doctrine  of ineffective  assistance  of \ncounsel.  General  allegations  regarding  workload  or  compensation do  not  establish  claims  if \nineffectiveness.  See Wilson,  547  So.2d  at  1340,  Cabello  v,  State,  524  So.2d  313,  316  (Miss. \n1988)  (“caseload  and  limited  resources  are,  absent  specific  instances  of error”  insufficient  to  find \nineffectiveness);  State  v.  Peart,  621  So.2d  780,  792  (La.  1993).  Even  if the  purpose  of the \n;  argument  is  not to  set  aside  a  conviction,  “ineffectiveness”  by  definition  occurs  only  when  a \npublic  defender’s  “acts  or  omissions  were  outside  the  wide  range  of professionally  competent \nassistance.”  Carter  v.  State,  97-CA-01468,  1998  WL  906431,  at  *  3  (Miss.  App.  Dec.  30,  1998) \n(quoting  Stickland  v.  Washington,  466  U.S.  668,  690  (1984)).  Such  analysis  depends  on  the \n' \n“facts  of the  particular  case.”  Id.

We have otherpriorities.\"\nI\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairnzan Jack Gordon, D-Okolona, Clarion-\nLedger (Januar), 20. 2004).\nI\ni\n!\n\n!\nI\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\ni\nThe \"ultimate obligation\" of the State to provide effective indigent defense was recognized\nI by the U.S. Supreme Court in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963)and the Mississippi\nSupreme Court as early as Corm v.State, 170 So.2d 20.21 (Miss. 1964), when it quoted Gideon for\nI\ntile proposition that the fundamental and essential right to counsel for indigent defendants is an\nI \"'obligation of the States. \"'l And in 2001, as a result of this case, this Court fully elucidated the\ninevitable link between the obligation of state-provided indigent defense to the adequate\ni\nimplementation and.fimding of that system of indigent defense. In so doing, this Court gave life to\nI\nthe complaint of Quitman County, and indeed of all poor Mississippi counties, that decades of gross\nunderfunding of that State obligation and noble constitutional right had rendered it a mere idealistic\nI\nplatitude.\nI\nThis Court reaffirmed in Quitnmn v.State, 807 So. 2d 401 (Miss. 2001) - as it has since\n1964 - that it is the obligation and duty of the State of Mississippi to provide all indigent defendants\nI\nwithin its state with an \"'effective\" defense. If itdoes not, the courts must step in, as this Court did in\nI\nHo.$/brd v. State, 525 So. 2d 789 (Miss. 1988), where itheld that where the Legislature \"fails to fulfill\ni a constitutional obligation to enable the judicial branch to operate independently and effectively, then\nithas violated its Constitutional duty and the Judicial branch has the authority to see that the courts do\ni\nnot atrophy.\"\nI\nThis Court's prior decision in Quitman is a model of clarity in its afialysis of the tools of an\neffective indigent defense, and in its discussion of the circumstances under which the machinery of\nI\nI i See also Triplett v. State, 666 So.2d 1356 1357 (Miss. 1995)i(same)\" Vie/ee v.State, 653 So.2d\n920, 922 (Miss. 1995) ( our decisions make clear that inadequate ass stance does not satisfy the right\nto counsel made applicable to the State.\").\n!\nI\n\ni\nI\njustice can become so broken and underresourced that the very integrity of the justice system has\ni\nbeen undermined, and the independence of the judicial branch threatened. In 2003, Quitman\nI\npresented its case for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief under Article 3, Section 26 of the\nMississippi Constitution to the Circuit Court, Judge Ann Lamar presiding. As set forth below, the\nI\nevidence of Quitman's \"constitutional dilemma\" in providing adequate indigent defense RE 3 (Tr. Ct.\n!\nOp. ¶ 83) was overwhelming. But Quilman did not prevail, and so isagain before this Court today.\nQuilman respectfully presents its case to this Court, and requests that the Court order that a statewide,\ni\nstate-funded indigent defense system be implemented forthwith.\nI\nSTATEMENT OF ISSUES\nQuitman County raises the follov¢ing issues oll appeal:\nI\nDid the Circuit Court err in applying the standard for evaluating effective assistance\nof counsel claims by individual post-conviction defendants as set forth in Howard v.\nI\nState, 853 So. 2d 781,796 (Miss. 2003)to Quitman County's claim for prospective\ninjunctive relief against systemic constitutional violations, rather than applying the\ntest set forth by this Court in State v. Quitman CounO, , 807 So. 2d 401 (Miss. 2001)\nI\nfor this case, i.e., whether the county-based indigent defense system fails to provide\nthe tools of an adequate defense?\nI . Did the Circuit Court err by assuming itwas Quitman County's burden to prove itcut\nfunding for schools, hospitals and local law enforcement to pay for indigent defense\nand therefore ignoring the unrebutted evidence that Quitman County cannot afford a\nI constitutionally adequate indigent defense system, the burden established by this\nCourt's prior decision in this action?\ni . Did the Circuit Court commit prejudicial error by (a) excluding expert testimony\noffered by Quitman County on the ultimate issues of fact set forth in State v. Quitman\nCounO: and (b) permitting Circuit Judges who preside ove_ Quitman County criminal\ndispositions to testify and opine that the public defenders were \"effective advocates\"\n|\nor were \"'effectively representing their indigent clients\" in vmlatmn of State v.\nQuitman Coun O,and the Circuit Court's own evidentiary rulings and despite the\nCircuit Judges' acknowledged lack of basis for such opinions?\ni\nI\n, Did the Circuit Court err by ignoring credible and unrebutted expert and lay witness\ntestimony, authoritative standards, governmental studies arid other documentary\n! evidence, and admissions by defendants' own witnesses su_pporting Quitman\nCounty's claims?\nI Did the Circuit Court err by following the dissent in State v. Quitman County rather\nthan the governing precedent and determining that Quitman County had failed to\nshow that the \"'county-based system has resulted in the inability of the judiciary to\nI 3\n\ni\nI\noperate in an independent and effective manner\" against the ovenvhelming weight of\nthe evidence?\nI\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nI Quitman filed this lawsuit in December 1999 contending that the State of Mississippi had\n\"improperly and unfairly shifted the state's obligation to provide and pay for representation of\ni\nindigent defendants to the counties of Ivlississippi,'\" and in so doing, had violated its duty under\nI Article 3, Section 26 of the Mississippi Constitution and other provisions of state law to provide\nindigent defendants with the \"effective assistance of counsel.\" Rec. 9.2 After the State's Motion to\ni\nDismiss was denied, the/Vlississippi Supreme Court affirmed on interlocutory, appeal and remanded\ni the case for trial.\nThis Court's 2001 opinion set lbrth the standards that would govern the trial, State v.\nI\nQuitman CounO' 807 So. 2d 401 (Miss. 2001), reh \"gdenied (2002), and ruled that Quitman had a\nI\nright to a statewide public defender system if it proved its allegations, including \"'theCounty's\ninability to fund an effective system, and the failure of the existing system to provide indigent\nI\ndefendants in Quitman County with the tools of an adequate defense.\" 807 So. 2d at408 (emphasis\nI\nadded). 3\nI 2 Record excerpts are cited as \"RE \" Other citations to the reporter's transcript are given as\n\"'Tr. ,'\" exhibits introduced into evidence by plaintiff or defendants are cited as \"'PX \" or\n\"'DX ,\" respectively, and other portions of the record on appeal are cited as \"Rec..\"\nn\ns The ultimate constitutional question the Supreme Court recognized in Quitman is whether \"the\ncounty-based system has resultetf' in unconstitutionality that requires the Court to \"interfere in this\ntraditionally legislative function and order the Legislature to establish a statewide, state-funded\nI\nsystem of indigent defense.\" 807 So. 2d at 410. The Court elucidated facts that if established would\nentitle Quitman to statewide relief, including:\nI (_) the State's refusal to provide funds; iI . tLI\n(2)\nthat funding is inadequate; [ t! .I\n(3)\nthat the lack of resources results in inadequate representation;\n! (4) the lack ofstatewide oversight; I ,i ,\n(5) the impact on county government services;\n(6) the disproportionate burden on smaller counties with significant crime problems; and\nI (7) the chronic underfunding that adversely affects the administration of justice.\nFootnote continued on next page\ni\n\ni\ni\nThis Court also directed the trial court to determine:\ni\n\"'whether, assuming the State has failed in its duty to provide\neffective indigent defense, the county-based system has resulted in\ng the inability of the judiciary to operate inan independent and\neffective manner to the extent that this Court must, of necessity.\ninterfere in this traditionally legislative function and order the\ng Legislature to establish a statewide, state-funded system of indigent\ndefense.\"\n| ld. at 410 (emphasis added). Such remedy isrequired \"where the Legislature fails to act\" and so\n\"fails to fulfill a constitutional obligation to enable the judicial branch to operate independently and\nI\neffectively'\" so that the courts \"'have the authority and duty to intervene.\" M at 409.\nI At trial, Quitman presented detailed testimony from three qualified experts, Stephen Bright,\nSteven Farese, and Thomas Fortner, RE 16(Tr. 333), RE 17(Tr. 624), RE 18(750), supported by\nI\nextensive evidence. See pp. 9-22 below. Defendants proffered no expert testimony. Quitman\nI\nintroduced extensive authoritative evidence concerning the tools of an effective defense and\ngovernmental studies and other evidence demonstrating Mississippi's county-based system wide\nI\nfailure to provide those tools. See pp. 9-14 below• Defendants offered virtually no evidence in\nI\nrebuttal• Quitman also directed the court to numerous supportmg admissions by defendants' own\nwitnesses, undercutting defendants' largely rhetorical arguments. See pp. 40-41 below• This\nI\nevidence was ignored by the Circuit Court. See pp. 25-41 below•\nI\nFoomote continued from previous page\ni\nht. at 408-09. As with other systemic constitutional cases, Quitman's burden of proof at trial was by\n.... _l I • •\na preponderance of the evidence, although strict scrutiny apphes to the aha!ysls of the pamcu ar tools\nI See n. 7_\"_ below; see, e.g. DOE v.

Tenn. 1967) (holding that plaintiffs had failed to establish by preponderance of the\nevidence that school desegregation plan rio ated the constitution)•\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nThe Circuit Court's opinion expressed various \"'conclusions\" and in'list format described the\nl\nsupporting evidence, but avoided rendering specific or general findings of fact, weighing the\ng\nevidence, making credibility determinations, or addressing the uncontroverted expert opinions.\nRemarkably, the Court expressed 17o\"'conclusions\" about the issues the Supreme Court said were to\nI\nbe tried, for example, whether the county-based system provides \"the tools of an adequate defense.\"\ng\n807 So. 2d at 408. Indeed, the opinion issilent on the issues framed by this Court, but pursues\nl entirely different inquiries, such as whether the county proved a lawyer to be \"'incompetent\" RE 3\n(Tr. Ct. Op. ¶ 76) or whether any particular defendant demonstrably was prejudiced RE 3 (id. ¶¶ 72,\ni\n77). under the Howard v. State, 853 So. 2d 781, and Strickland v. lYashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)\nI analysis this Court rejected previously for prospective cases. The Circuit Courl also relied on self-\nserving testimony of the public defenders as to their own \"competen[ce],'\" equally self-serving\nI\ntestimony from the District Attorney that his adversaries are \"'competent,\" and the opinion of the local\nI\nCircuit Judges (in some '=lay-witness'\" capacity) to the same effect. RE 3(Tr. Ct. ¶¶ 43-48, 79). And\nwithout am, basis in this Court's opinion, the Circuit Court actually opined' that despite unchallenged\nI\nmassive deficits, it was the county's burden to prove it already had cut funding for schools, hospitals\nI\nand local law enforcement to pay for indigent defense, RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶ 70), rather than proving an\ninability to a.['/brda constitutionally adequate system (807 So. 2d at 408) as Quitman demonstrated it\nII\ncould not do. See pp. 29-30 below.\nI\nFinally, displaying a \"'personal\" opinion, the Circuit Court lauded this Court's 2001\nI dissenting opinion that indigent defense is a legislative matter, called the creation of two capital\ndefense offices in 2000 a \"'major step,\" and expressed the hope that left to its own devices the\nI\nLegislature eventually would correct any remaining shortcomings, despite no record evidence the\n! State would do so and substantial evidence to the contrary. RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶¶ 82-84). Notably,\nI\n\nI\nI\ndefendants failed to produce a single witness to testify that a statewide system is likely to be\ng\nimplemented by tile Legislature without judicial intervention.\nI\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nQuitman CounD'\ng\nLike the vast majority of counties in Mississippi, Quitman utilizes the services of part-time\nI defenders who simultaneously maintain unlimited, unregulated private practices, of potentially\nsubstantial financial value. Butch Scipper. the Chancery, Clerk and County Administrator, and\n!\nBrooks Earnest, a member of the Board of Supervisors. testified that Quitman cannot afford to pay\nI\nany more than it currently does for indigent defense, 4RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶ 7). Their testimony was\nundisputed and supported by all other record evidence.\nI\nQuitman's economic prospects remain extremely bleak. Tr. 831. With a declining\nI\npopulation of just over 10.000. PX 20, Quitman has high percentages of residents younger than 18or\nI older than 65, id., a skewed age distribution that results in a disproportionate demand for government\nservices with few taxpayers and a high rate of homestead property tax exemptions. Tr. 137-39, 146-\nI\n47. Quitman has a per capita income of less than $I1.000, a mere two-thirds of the state average.\nI Tr. 139-43, PX 20._ In recent years Quitman Count), also has seen falling agriculture prices, rising\ncosts and natural disasters such as floods leading to further setbacks inthe retail and service sectors.\nIi\nTr. 135-36. Manufacturing has fared no better, with plants closed or inbankruptcy. Tr. 143-45.\ni\n4 Mr. Scipper has worked tirelessly with judges, bar representatives, prosecutors, county officials\nand legislators to reform indigent defense in the only way it can t_uly be reformed, by implementing a\ni\nstatewide system. Tr. 106, 179, 286-87. The Quitman Board of Supervisors fully supports those\nefforts of Mr. Scipper and others to reform indigent defense. Tr. 835-36, 839-40.\nI\ns Almost 43% of the residents are eligible for Medicaid, an indicator of poverty; only two counties\nhave higher percentages. PX 21. However, 44 counties have rates of Medicaid-eligible residents\nabove 25%, indicating that poverty is v,'idespread throughout Mississippi counties, hi.\n!\nI\n\nI\nI\nQuitman County's governmental prospects are equally bleak. Tr. 83I. The county cannot\na\nraise taxes to pay for existing or new programs. Tr. 147-5 I. Its residents face the highest tax rotes\ng\namong the residents of the adjacent counties with which Quitman competes (PX 25): yet even with its\nhigh tax rates, it has by thr the smallest tax base among the adjacent counties. PX 26. People have\ng\nmoved out because of high taxes and registered their cars incounties with far lower tax rates. Raising\nI\ntaxes any more would accelerate that downward spiral. Tr. 149-52. Indeed, Quitman already has an\naccumulated deficit of more than $2 million in operating losses and operating debt (approximately\nI\n$2,000 per taxpayer) (Tr. 152-53, 159-61, PX 22-24) that precludes the county from starting new\n!\nprograms or expanding existing ones. Tr. 153.\nil The deficit has accumulated over more than a decade and has several causes. Tr. 153-56,\n158. The high-profile Simon and Cart capital murder cases wiped out the county's surplus and forced\nil\nitto borrow money and raise taxes. Tr. 107-09. Subsequently, the deficit grew to cover the\nI unplanned costs of responding to natural disasters and unfunded state and federal mandates• These\nmandates required the county, among other things, to contract for costly garbage se_'ice, obtain\nI\nliability insurance that doubled in cost last year, and hire additional employees such as trained\nI\nemergency dispatchers and trained jailers at higher salaries and benefits. _'Quitman cannot change its\npriorities by cutting expenditures to start new programs or expand existing ones such as indigent\nI\n6 Defendants' suggestion that the deficit largely was due to girbage service costs and economic\nI\ndevelopment bonds on which industries defaulted was repeated b_'the Circuit Court. RE 3 (Tr. Ct.\nOp. ¶ 8). But Quitman had to contract for solid waste pickup bedause ofa ifederal ban on landfills and\nthe State required that itcosi,gm the economic development obligations. Tr. 155, 156. Regardless, the\nI\ncounty has a very large deficit that prevents it from paying more indigent defense or for other vital\n• . II _ :\nprograms. The factors that have fueled the deficit are outside thellcqunty's icontrol and new disasters\nand mandates could occur at any time and impose additional unbudgeted costs, evidenced at trial\nI • - I ;.\nwhen the state Office of Post-Conv_ctJon Counsel moved to compel Quitman to pay attorneys' fees\nand costs of Anthony Carr's post-conviction proceedings. PX 47. Such costs could further drive the\ncounty deeper into the red. Tr. 154, 181,281.\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\ndefense, since services are already below a bare bones. Tr. 145.-46. 7 In short, Quitman has little\ng\nflexibility in its spending decisions, 80-85% of its expenditures are mandated by the state and federal\ng\ngovernments, Tr. 163, and much of the rest is effectively mandated by state and federal requirements\nthat the county match contributions in order to participate in their programs. Tr. 163-65, 171-72. 8\nI\nIndigent Defense in Mississippi\nI\nUndisputed testimony and evidence established that the defense system that fails to provide\nthe tools of an adequate defense inQuitman exists throughout Mississippi. Mr. Farese characterized\nI\nthe system as \"broken,\" \"made to fail,\" and in some respects \"should shock our legal conscience,\"\nI\nRE 17(Tr. 647-48, 697). He concluded that a statewide indigent defense system with resources\nI comparable to the prosecution is necessary \"'to balance the system\" and restore a properly functioning\nadversarial system where \"'[j]ustice isthe final product.\" RE 17 (Tr. 64849).\" Mr. Bright testified\nI\n7 For example, the county's contract ambulance service does not even have IV capability but isthe\nonh, anabulance se_'ice in a rural area with a large elderly population• Tr. 145, 164. 165. The local\nI\nhospital provides only basic care, but the county cut its contribution for indigent care by $30,000 to\nreduce its deficit. Tr. 145, 162, 166. The poor persons\" health clinic is open only four days a week\nbecause the county had to cut its appropriation by $12.000 for deficit reduction. Tr. 162, 165.\nI\nModest $15,000 dues to the North Della Planning and Development District provide, among other\nthings, more than 3,000 Meals on Wheels per month tbr the poor, sick and elderly. Tr. 169-70.\nI 8 For example, the county's $33,250 contribution to the public library is a condition of a stale\ngrant which, with the county's contribution, comprises about 90% of the library's revenue. Tr. 166-\n67. Mr. Scipper and Mr. Earnest described the devastating consequences to Quitman children and the\nI elderly, if the library were forced to close, deprive them of access',to newspapers, magazines, books\nand computers. Tr. 167, 834-35. Similarly, the county contributes $11,000 to supplement state and\nfederal grants in order to keep the Soil Conservation Service office in Marks open to provide services\ni of vital importance in an agricultural county prone to floods and o_er natural disasters. Tr. 168,\nI\n831-32. Likewise, the county pays $39,000 pursuant to an agreement with Mississippi State\n. [ i •\nUniversity to keep the local Extension Service office open, to give Qultman residents access to\ni nutrition programs for school children and their families, money management advice for poor people\nwho often labor under burdensome debt, and Extension Service programs for farmers and\n/\nhomeowners. Tr. 168-69, 832-34.\ni\n\" As set lbrth below at 31-33, Mr. Farese specifically was pre_:!uded from opining on, as this\nCourt set forth as the very heart of this case, whether this imbalance went to the very \"integrity\" of\nthe system• RE 17(Tr. 699).\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nthat the system provides \"superficial processing\" of the poor and \"no\" criminal defense representation\nI\nin the true meaning of the words, RE 18(Tr. 760-61), and that the implementation ofa statewide\nI\nsystem - like Florida, Colorado, North Carolina, and Georgia -- is necessary to resolve the problems\ninherent inthe county-based system. RE 18(Tr. 827-28). Ivir. Fortner concluded that the current\ng\ncounty-based system is \"'unfair\" and \"inadequate,\" and that a full-time, district wide public defender\ng\noffice is needed to deliver indigent defense services in a constitutionally adequate manner in\nMississippi. RE 16(Tr. 363,399-400). Mr. Fortner testified thatthe establishment of a full-time\nI\npublic defender office would require state action and state funding.l° RE 16 (Tr. 363-64). This\nI\nexpert testimony was undisputed.\nI The expert witnesses, authoritative standards and public defenders themselves identified tools\nof an effective criminal defense, including (I) client communication, (2) factual investigation,\nI\n(3) informed plea negotiation, (4) motion practice, (5) expert consultation, (6) independent forensic\nI\nanalysis, (7) competent trial counsel, (8) sentencing advocacy, and (9) adequate appellate advocacy.\nRE 16 (Tr. 338-39), RE 17(616-17, 644-45), RE 18(746, 769-72). The Mississippi county-based\ni\nsystem does not provide these necessary tools. See pp. 15-22 below.\ni\nUndisputed expert testimony established that these systemic flaws are inherent in a part-time\nsystem and cannot be cured by appointing different lawyers or prohibiting particular practices such as\nI\nguilty pleas on the day of arraignment, RE 16 (Tr. 357, 359), because the incentives created by a part-\ni\ntime system allowing for private practices invariably lead attorneys to minimize the amount of time\ni\n10\nA full-time public defender office would need an adequate salary; investigative support;\ni secretarial and other support; office space; access to legal resources; a com_uter system; professional\nsupervision and consulting attorneys: and funds for conflicts of i_eresl. RE 17(Tr. 648--49). The\nresources required are far beyond the means of Quitman County and other poor rural countries.\nRE 16(349-50, 336, 359-60) RE 17(Tr. 658, 661-62).\ni\n| 10\n\nI\nI\nspent representing indigent clients in favor of their paying clients. RE 17(Tr. 647-48), RE 16(353),\ni\nRE 18(805-806). I'\n!\nThe record evidence of statewide inadequacy was overwhelming and virtually undisputed,\nsince the state offered absolutely no expert testimony or evidence. Of particular simaificance, the\nI\nSpangenberg Group, a well-known consulting organization specializing in indigent defense,\nI\nconducted a comprehensive study of indigent defense commissioned by the Mississippi Bar\nAssociation that was introduced into evidence. RE 16(Tr. 319). The Public Defense Commission\nI\nrelied upon the Spangenberg study and incorporated the study's reports into its final Implementation\nI\nPlan. RE 15 (Tr. 110, 112-13). The key findings included that:\nI - Funding for indigent defense is totally inadequate (amounting to $3.24 per capita\nin 1998, the lowest in the nation);\nI\nMr. Fortner succinctly summed up the core economic disincentives:\nThe system is itself responsible for a lot of that type activity. The way the system is\nI\nset up... encourages spending the least amount of time possible on a case. It\nencourages pleading guilty on arraignment day. I mean it encourages disposing of\nthese cases as quickly as possible so that you can, in Quitman County's case. go to\nI\ntile other counties you serve and do the same thing there and still have time to engage\nin your private practice, whatever that private practice may be. Because my\nexperience has been that that's - private practice takes precedence over part time\nI public defender praclice. Itjust does.\nI My opinion is that the part-time system.., encourages [lawyers] to dispose of\n[cases] quickly, without proper investigation, without looking into all the various\nmotions that might be filed, to make the best deal you can as fast as you can and take\nI care of the case and be done with it. That's what it encourages.\nRE 16(Tr. 346, 353-54). Mr. Fortner concluded the following:\nQ. What are the chances that a system in a county that uses th,e part time method\nI\nwill operate in an adequate manner? I\ni\nA. I don't think there's any chance of that. It's the_s'ame char_ce Quitman\n• Ii i\nI County has had, I guess. And there hasnt been,a chance for itto happen\nhere. I\nRE 16 (Tr. 358-59).\nI\nI\n\ni\n!\n- The lack of adequate resources for indigent defense services results in poor\nquality services and representation; and\nI\n- There is no statewide oversight of indigent defense, which leads to a\nhodgepodge, county-by-county approach to providing defense services.\nI\nRE 15 at MS 03868-03869, 03966. ]2\ni These shortcomings also were identified by the statutorily created Mississippi Public\nDefenders Task Force in its September 2000 report, introduced into evidence but ignored by the\n!\ncourt, that concluded that \"'indigent defense remained a vexing problem for the counties\" and that\nI\nstate funding is needed. RE 8, Introduction and Narrative at 5; RE 16(Tr. 320). Notably, the report\nincluded responses by Senior Circuit Judges to a survey describing inadequate representation they\n!\nobserved in their districts. RE 8, Attachment C; Tr. 126-27) 3\nI\ni: Like the testifying experts, the Spangenberg study found that the tools ofan adequate defense\nwere not being provided throughout Mississippi:\nI\nResources are not sufficient to provide adequate representation even in felony cases,\nparticularly inthose counties using the contract public defender system. Every. aspect\nI\nof defense representation is compromised. Specifically there is very little early\nrepresentation provided, investigation conducted, attorney/client contact, or use of\nexperts. There is a low trial rate in felony and misdemeanor cases. The requirement\nI for contract defenders and assimaed counsel to handle their own appeals, often with\nno additional compensation, creates a disincentive for taking cases to trial. Case\npreparation isoften late, and frequently preliminary hearings are waived and\ni defendams are held injail three to six months without counsel until arraignment in\ncircuit court. The overall situation has lead to an insufficient number of qualified\nattorneys willing to take court appointments in indigent cases or to seek contract\npublic defender positions•\ni\nRE 15at MS 03868-69. i\nI\nl\nI\n13 For example, the Senior Circuit Judge for the 21st District reported:\n: [ '\nPublic Defenders are presently not on a level ground witli prosecutors. They have no\naccess to •m,,_estl-gators and other staff assis•tance. Becaus_e,tIhey are 'part-tim.e, many\nI\n' L ]l I , ii\ndefendants are not afforded adequate counsel because of part-ttme defenders not\n........ r '\nputting sufficient time mto their criminal docket.

Moreover, the lack of\nI motion practice is only part of a larger problem: the Quitman public defenders routineh, waive\nimportant stages of the proceedings, effecting a complete denial of the right to counsel. 31\nI\nEvidence established that because of the absence of client communication, fact investigation\n! and motion practice, indigent defendants in Quitman simply do not receive meaningful plea\nnegotiation services.

This accounts for over 40% of all public\ndefender cases in Quitman Circuit Court during that period. Remarkably, the public defenders do not\ni\neven look at the prosecution's file before pleading their clients guilty. Mr. Mellen testified that only\ni\nafter the plea agreements are finalized do the public defenders review his file to \"legitimize\" the plea.\nRE 7 (Tr. 1018). 33\nI\nThe Circuit Court simply ignored evidence that pleading clients guilty on the day of\nI\narraignment is not an acceptable practice. 34 RE 16 (Tr. 340).

In contrast, the defense attorney is only getting started. 35 RE 4 (Tr.\n591)\nI\n32 As Mr. Former testified, the rapport necessary for the client to trust counsel's opinion \"doesn't\nI\nhappen in a five minute meeting.\" RE 16(Tr. 340). Counsel also needs time to fully investigate the\ncase, talk to witnesses and ensure the client should agree to the plea being offered. RE 16(Tr. 341).\nI 33 The breakdown of the adversarial system is apparent in the lack of incentive for the District\nAttorney to negotiate. Mr. Mellen testified his relationship with Quitman County public defenders\nwas such that: \"All of them, we work real well xvith. When I say:that, I may be in a courtroom\nI during arraignment and they'll ask me about it and I may have a confession in it or maybe\nrecommended probation and they'll look at that file in order to legitimize maybe their suggestion to\ntheir client.\" (Tr. 1018) He also testified District Attorney )s officeL o,ffers recommendations based\nupon the category of case that are largely uniform, regardless oftl_e facts. RE 7 (Tr. 1005-07).\nI\nI\n34 Mr. Shackelford testified that: \"if, after talking with the witness - I kfiow there is probably\nI'\ncause then I see no reason to go through all of the - jump through :allthe hoops, particularly if all of\nI\nthe witnesses are law enforcement.\" (Tr. 506-07)\n35 According to Mr. Mellen, the District Attorneys and the courts encourage pleas on the day of\nI\narraignment because it is administratively easier and 4,con V eme\"nt \" when everyone istogether on one\nFootnote continued onnext page\nI 20\n\nI\nI\nFinally, Quitman offers little indigent defense if an arraignment day plea falls through. While\nI\nthere is little occasion for trial advocacy because there are few trials (only 8% of the public defender\nI\ncases were tried during the period February 1995-March 2003 were actually tried, RE 5), where there\nwere trials, they were scheduled only a few weeks after the public defender was first appointed at\nI\narraignment. RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶ 33). Thus, any investigation, motion practice, expert consultation\nI\nand other preparation would have to be started and completed during this brief period. 36 Moreover,\nI the trials are under-resourced in a core Constitutional respect, because indigent defendants have no\nmeaningful access to experts. Neither Mr. Tisdell nor Mr. Pearson has ever requested an expert in a\nI\nnon-capital case. RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶ 32); (Tr. 461) 37Mr. Shackelford - who has served as a public\nI defender since 1990 - only requested the services of an expert once. RE 3 (Tr. CI.

Indeed, Mr. IVlellen admitted that public defenders often come back from\nreceiving the District Attorney's offer \"'withina matter of minutes\" to accept it. RE 7 (Tr. 1020-21 ).\nIt is no surprise that 40% of cases are pied on the day of arraignment.\n!\n36 Mr. Farese testified that 3-5 weeks is not sufficient time for the public defenders to adequately\nprepare to try a case, particularly given their competing caseloads. RE 17(Tr. 642.)

THE CIRCUIT COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR BY APPLYING THE\nWRONG LEGAL STANDARD TO QU1TMAN COUNTY'S SYSTEI_IIC CLAIMS\nSEEKING PROSPECTIVE RELIEF,\nA. The Post-Conviction Standard of Howard v. State and Strickland v. Washington\nDoes Not Apply in This Case.\nThe Circuit Court committed reversible error by applying the wrong legal standard to\nQuitman's claims. See McClendon v. State, 539 So. 2d 1375, 1377 (Miss. 1989) (\"where, as here, the\ntrial judge has applied an erroneous legal standard, we should not hesitate to reverse\"). Although\nciting this Court's prior decision, the Circuit Court did not use the standard the Supreme Court held\ngoverns this case. Instead, it applied the higher, two part test used only for post-conviction challenges\nby individual criminal defendants under Howard v. State and Strickland v. Washington. RE 3 (Tr. Ct.\nil . i\n4,, According to a January 20, 2004 article by the Assocmted Press and Local Wire and the Clarion\nLedger, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Jack Gordob, D-Okolona asserted the cost (of\nfunding a public defender system) isthe responsibility of the counties, and that: \"We don't have any\nmoney for that right now. We have other priorities.\"\n25\n\nI\nI\nOp. ¶ 66) (\"The Supreme Court recently stated the standard of review of effective assistance of\nI\ncounsel cases,\" citing Howurd and Strickland).\nI\nThe Circuit Court proceeded as if this were an individual post-conviction proceeding and\nQuitman had to prove on a case-by-case basis that the attorney's performance was deficient and the\nI\ndefendant was prejudiced, i.e.. but lbr these deficiencies, there would have been a different outcome\nI\nin the trial court. Thus, the Circuit Court repeatedly criticized Quitman's proof for supposed failure\nto show \"incompetence\" and prejudice inparticular cases that would have warranted reversal of the\nI\nconviction under Howard and Strickland for example, by citing the lack of evidence of post-\nI\nconviction proceedings, that cases had \"'been overturned,\" of incompetence, or that the experts had\ni employed the Strickland test in reviewing any of the cases\" or proved any defendant had been\n\"prejudiced\" because of a plea entered on arraignment day. RE 3(Tr. Ct. Op. ¶¶ 72, 76, 77.)\nI\nAlthough many of tllese criticisms are baseless, since the record evidence of Defender and\nI expert testimony and Table PX 4 of every felony case from March 1995 to 2003 demonstrates\nobjective incompetence and ineffectiveness in the provision of defense services in Quitman, including\nI\nspecific examples and proofoflhe complete absence of attorney services, United States v. Cronic,\nI\n466 U.S. 648 (1984), the courts did not fc,cus on proving Strickland prejudice in individual outcomes\nbecause it was not relevant to or required by this Court's opinion. Hence, the Circuit Court\nI\nfundamentally misconceived Quitman's case. Quitman's complaint is that \"the existing county-based\nI\nsystem results in an inadequate and unconstitutional system of indigent defense.\" 807 So. 2d at 405.\nIi\nThe county does not seek to overturn particular convictions, but rather seeks a system that meets\nI\nconstitutional guarantees. As this Court recognized, it is \"the State's failt_re to remedy the alleged\nIi\nI\nsystemic ineffective ass stance of counsel that is the crux of the Countys complaint.'\" ld. at 408.\ni\n| 26\n\nI\nI\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court rejected the State's legal challenges and held that Quitman\nI\nis entitled to the prospective statewide relief it seeks if it established the cost of an effective system of\nI\nindigent criminal defense, the county's inability to fund such a system, and the failure of the existing\nsystem to provide indigent defendants in Quitman with the tools of an adequate defense. Id. at 408.\nI\n410. The evidence at trial established each of these elements. It was erroneous and unfair for the\nI\nCircuit Court subsequently to apply a different, higher standard that is inconsistent with the systemic\nI case presented by Quitman pursuant to the Supreme Court's directive. 47\nB. Quitman Count)' Showed That Essential Tools of Defense Are Not Provided\nI Even When Measured Under the Standards of Strickland-Based Cases.\nIn any event. Quitman demonstrated that the county-based system does not provide the tools\nI\nof an adequate defense even under the post-conviction cases that use the Strickland analysis.\nI Stric£'/and itself emphasized the importance of attorney-client communication, citing counsel's\n\"'duties to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of\nI\nimportant developments during the course of the prosecution.\" 466 U.S. at 688.\nI\nI\n47 Like the Court in this case. other courts have concluded that prospective challenges to indigent\ndefense systems are not subject to the requirements of StricMand and that the proper inquiry is\nwhether the system provides the tools of an adequate defense. See, e.g., Lucko, v. Harris, 860 F.2d\nI 1012, 1017 (llth Cir. 1988); State v. Peart, 621 So. 2d 780, 791 (La. 1993) (creating \"'rebuttable\npresumption\" that \"'indigents . . .are receiving assistance of counsel not sufficiently effective to\nmeet constitutionally required standards\" to be applied prospectively); New York Coun O,Lmt5:ers\"\nI Assoc. v. State, 745 N.Y.S.2d 376, 384 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2002). The distinction between the standards\napplicable to post-conviction proceedings and to systemic challenges rests on the very different\npolicies applicable in the two kinds of cases. In a post.conviction challenge, courts attempt to\nI ....\nbalance the individual defendant's interest in challenging his convtctlon against broader interests in\nI\njudicial economy and finality. StricMand, 466 U.S. at 693-94. The c'oncerns about certainty and\nfinality of past criminal convictions do not arise in systemic cases. In those cases, society's interest in\nthe provision of an effective defense to all citizens is paramount. See Luclo, v. Harris, 860 F.2d at\nI\n1017; New York Co,toO: Lmt5,ers Association v. State, 745 N.Y.S. 2dIat.384. Accordingly, courts\nlook to whether the system provides the essential tools of an effective defense across the broad run of\ncases; the performance of a particular lawyer or the result in any one case is not decisive.\nI\nI 27\n\nI\nI\nPost-conviction cases following Strickland have identified other tools that the county-based\nI\nsystem does not provide as fundamental to effective assistance of counsel. 4_ For example, this Court\nI\ndeclared that meaningful discussions regarding the realities of a case are the \"cornerstones of\neffective assistance of counsel.\" State v. Tokman, 564 So. 2d 1339, 1343 (Miss. 1990) (citing\nI\nGaines v. Hopper, 575 F.2d 1147, 1150 (5th Cir. 1978)). Similarly, this Court has recognized that\nI\nindependent investigation is an essential component of a basic defense. Triplett v. State, 666 So.2d\n1356, 1361 (Miss. 1995): Tokman. 564 So. 2d 1339. 1342 (Miss. 1990) (\"at a minimum, counsel has\nI\na duty to interview potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts and\nI\ncircumstances of the case\"): Triplett v. State. 666 So. 2d 1356, 1361 (Miss. 1995) (\"The Defendant is\nI entitled to a basic defense .... Basic defense in this case required complete investigation to ascertain\nevery, material fact about this case, favorable and unfavorable.\"). Numerous courts have found that\nI\ndefense counsel's exclusive reliance on the prosecution evidence constitutes ineffective assistance. 49\nI\nI\n48 See. e.g.. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003) (investigation ofmitigation evidence);\nI'l'illiams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000) (same); Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685 (2002) (failure to call\nI witnesses and waiving of argument in sentencing phase): Roe v. Flores-Ortegu, 528 U.S. 470 (2000)\n(failure to file notice of appeal); Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259 (2000) (thilure to file merits brief\nwithout consent); United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984) (multiple factors, including limited\n! time to prepare for trial and witness inaccessibility, inexperience of defender); Hill v. Lockhart, 474\nU.S. 52 (1985) (guilty plea challenges).\n49 See, e.g., Bigner v. State. 822 So.2d 342,350 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002); Yabrough v. State, 529\n!\nSo.2d 659, 662 (Miss. 1988); Fer_son v. State, 507 So.2d 94, 96 (Miss. 1987). Indeed, the Court\nhas recognized that the \"'failure [] to conduct any investigation at all\" is an \"identifiable lapse\" in the\nadversarial process. Tokntan, 564 So.2d at 1342. A preemptive d,'ecision to conduct no investigation\nI\ndoes not fall within the ambit of sound trial strategy, as the public defenders have yet to obtain the\nfacts on which such a decision could be based. Silva v. Woodford, 279' F.3d 825,847 (9th Cir. 2002);\nWalker v.Lockhart, 807 F.2d 136, 140 (8th Cir. 1986). Cf Tokmbn, 564:So.2d at 1343 (\"A common\nI\nthread of the fabric of the reviewing courts' deference to tactical considerations is thorough\ninvestigation.\"). Neither the court nor counsel can predict what a prompt, and thorough investigation\nmight disclose. Bouchilh_n v. Collins, 907 F.2d 589, 597 (5th Cir. 1990).\nI\nI 28\n\nI\nI\nIn making these decisions, courts look to objective criteria promulgated by the American Bar\nI\nAssociation and other standard-setting bodies indetermining whether essential tools were provided.\nI\nSee, e.g., Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688 (\"Prevailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar\nAssociation standards and the like. e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-1. I to 4-8.6 (2d ed.\nI\n1980) (\"The Defense Function\"), are guides to determining what is reasonable\"); Wiggins v. Smith,\nI\n123 S. Ct. 2527, 2536-37 (2003) (counsel failed to go beyond presentence report and social services\nrecords in investigating mitigaling evidence, as required by ABA standards): llqlliams v. Taylor, 529\nI\nU.S. 362, 396 (2000) (counsel did not investigate and presenl substantial mitigating evidence, as\nI\nABA standards prescribe). These standards and their applicability to Quitman were briefed\nI extensively to the Circuil Court. See. e.g.. RE 20.\nHad the Circuit Court assessed the tools of an adequate defense in light of this Court's prior\nI\ndecisions and standards, itwould have been clear that the county-based system in Quitman and\nI counties does not provide the essential tools of defense and therefore violates the constitutional\nguaranlee of effective assistance of counsel.\nI\nII. THE CIRCUIT COURT APPLIED THE WRONG LEGAL STANDARD IN\nCONCLUDING THAT QUITMAN HAD NOT SHOWN FINANCIAL INJURY.\nI\nI\nThe Circuit Court also misconstrued the applicable legal standard with respect to financial\nI\nmatters. The Supreme Court's opinion made clear that the triable issue was whether Quitman could\nafford aconstitutionally adequate system of indigent defense. 807 So. 2d at 408 (describing\nI\n• ,[\nQuitman's intent to \"'show the cost of an effective system of indigent criminal defense\" and \"the\nI l ' i\nCounty's inability to fund such a system\"). Qui man met this burden, and established that itcannot\nI afford to pay any more than itdoes now for indigent defense. S!e pp.7 -9above . The unanimous\nexpert testimony was that a statewide, state-funded system isneeded to provide the tools of an\nI\neffective defense. See pp. 9-14 above. But even if one were to hypothesize a standalone county\nI 29\n\nI\nI\nsystem that provided adequate defense tools, Mr. Farese's opinion was that it would cost $300,000 to\nI\n$500,000, RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶¶ 41-42), 10to 15 times what Quitman can pay. Tr. 82.\nI\nThe Circuit Court disregarded this evidence and never reached the issue framed by the this\nCourt but instead addressed a different issue - noting the absence of testimony that \"'resources to fund\nI\nschools, hospitals, and local law enforcement were reduced because of indigent defense costs as\nI\nalleged in the Complaint, \"'_°RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶ 70) (emphasis in original) and expressing a personal\nbelief that \"indigent defense is neither the cause nor the solution to the county's financial\nI\ndifficulties.\" ld. Under this newly devised test, the county could prevail only if itshowed indigent\nI\ndefense was the sole cause of the county's financial problems and that these problems would\nI disappear if the financial burden of indigent defense were lifted, sl But there is no hint in that decision\nthat the county must prove that its financial problems are all due to indigent defense or that itwould\nI\nbe in excellent financial shape but tbr indigent defense costs. Obviously, no county ever could meet\nI such a requirement because one can always posit causes of fiscal or economic problems in addition to\nindigent defense costs. 5:\nI\nI 50 As the testimony demonstrated, this statement is untrue. Quitman's financial crisis has forced it\nto slash the modest amounts it provides the local hospital and Health Department for health care for\nthe poor by $42,000, a 25% cut. Tr. 162. Quitman also has had to fire an employee in the Circuit\nI Clerk's office, freeze hiring in all other departments, cut the Sheriff's budget and put off buying a\nmuch needed patrol car. Tr. 162.\n51 Moreover, the Circuit Court apparently believed that Quitman was required to trace each dollar\nI\nit now spends on indigent defense and show that it was taken fror_ designated funding for schools or\nhospitals or local law enforcement. This proposition has no support' inthe Supreme Court's opinion.\nt '\nI\n5._ By erecting a new financial injury barrier that by definition fs,impos'sihle to meet, the Circuit\n• . ] t .\nCourt's decision effectively nullifies the Supreme Court's holdmg that Qmtman has standing to\nchallenge the constitutionality of Mississippi's indigeni defensel@stem. Under Mississippi's\n\"'liberal\" standing requirements, Quitman has standing either if it ['has asserted a colorable interest in\ni the subject matter of the litigation or experienced an adverse effect from the conduct of the\ndefendant.\" 807 So. 2d at 405. The Supreme Court held that Quitman satisfied both prongs of this\nI disjunctive standard, id., aod the evidence demonstrated that Quitman has a \"'colorable interest\" in a\nFoomote continued onnext page\nI 3O\n\nI\nI\nFurthermore, the Circuit Court simply misunderstood Quitman's Pretrial Order contentions:\nI\nthat it would \"demonstrate at trial that it is in economic peril and is burdened with substantial and\nI increasing debt.., and its difficulties in providing the necessary funding even for the most basic\nhuman sern.'ices and obligations of the County.': Rec. 73 (emphasis added). 53\nI\n111. THE CIRCUIT COURT ERRED IN TWO KEY EVIDENTIARY RULINGS.\nI\nThe Circuit Court committed prejudicial error in two critical evidentiau, rulings. First. the\ncourt erroneously barred Quitman County from introducing expert testimony that the indigent defense\nI\nsystem has affected the independence and effectiveness of the courts. Second. the court erred by\nI\nallowing the local Circuit Judges to offer their opinions on the competence of the public defenders•\nEach of these errors affected a substantial right of Quitman County.\nI\nA. The Circuit Court's Erroneous Ruling Barring Quitman Counl2,.\"s Expert\nTestimony That The Current System Affects.The Integrity Of The Judicial\nI\nSystem Was tlighly Prejudicial.\nThe Supreme Court identified as a triable issue whether \"the county-based system has\nI\nresulted inthe inability of the judiciary to operate in an independent and effective manner.\" 807\nI\nSo. 2d at 410. If such an effect is shown, this Court held that it must necessarily intervene and \"'order\nthe Legislature to establish a stalewide, state-funded system of indigent criminal defense.\" I_L\nI\nI\nFootnote continued from previous page\nconstitutionally adequate indigent defense system and has \"experienced an adverse effect\" from\nI\ndefendants' breach of their duties•\n53 Undisputed exridence established that the Simon and Carr caises Wiped out the county's surp us\nI\nand forced \"tt to borrov_t money and rai\"se taxes exacerbatmg• the/to]wnwt aird spi.ral of Qult.man\nCounty's economy and financial position, and that the county labors under a $2 million deficit and so\ncan only provide bare-bones services for its impoverished population. Tr. 107-09• The county has\nI\neven been forced to cut the modest amounts itprovides for indig!nt care' to the local hospital and\nHealth Department by $42,000 (a 25% reduction)• Indigent defense is not the sole cause of the\ncounty's fiscal problems, but it has contributed substantially to them. Tr. 162, 165• (PX 47).\nI\nI 31\n\nI\nI\nPlainly, evidence that the integrity of the judicial system has been compromised by the State's failure\nI\nto provide the essential tools of an effective defense is critical to the outcome of this case.\nI\nHowever, the Circuit Court barred Quitman from introducing expert testimony on this critical\nissue. Its expert Steven Farese was asked to give an opinion in response to the following question:\nI\nBecause of all of the testimony that you have heard in this case and\nall of the study that you have done, all of the preparation for your\nI\ntestifying today and your... 26 years of experience practicing law in\nMississippi and indeed around the country, given what you know\nnow about the state of indigent defense in Mississippi, do you have\nI any fears for the integrity of our court system, should the system of\nindigent defense here in Quitman County continue?\nI RE 17 (Tr. 698-99.) Defendants' counsel objected on relevancy, and the Circuit Court sustained the\nobjection. 54\nI\nExcluding Mr. Farese's expert opinion on this matter plainly was error. Miss. R. Evid. 401\nI defines \"relevant evidence\" as \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of a fact that is\nof consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the\nI\nevidence.\" The comment to Rule 401 explains that \"'[i]fthe evidence has any probative value at all,\nI\n54 RE 17(Tr. 699.) The sustaining ofthis objection followed a lengthy colloquy in the testimony\nl\nof Quitman's first expert witness, Mr. Fortner, between the court and counsel regarding what expert\ntestimony Quitman properly could introduce. RE 16(Tr. 328-333.) At the conclusion of that\ncolloquy, the court made the following ruling to govern the introduction of Quitman's expert\nI testimony:\n\"We could put lawyers on the stand all day that will agree and disagree about what\nthat ultimate question is and we probably could put judges on the witness stand who\nI\nwould agree and disagree all day and it wouldn't surprise m_:. But our rules and Rule\n702 says that if specialized knowledge will assist the trier o_facts to understand the\nevidence, then the witness who is qualified by \"knowledge o_skill or experience or\nI\ntraining -- has quite expanded our previous rule -- may testify in the form of an\nopinion. And ! am going to allow this witness to testify as a'nexpert in the field\noffered of indigent defense and I do think that he has specialized knowledge through\nI his experience and training. And as to the ultimate questionlor the legal conclusion\nwhich must be drawn, that is a question for the Court and I would just as soon you\nstay away from it.\"\n|\nI 32\n\nI\nI\nthe rule favors its admission.\" As was apparent from the context in which the questions were asked,\nI\nMr. Farese's expert opinion would have been that the county-based system of indigent defense system\nI\nhas compromised the integrity of the criminal justice system in Mississippi - an ultimate issue in the\ncase under Miss. R. Evid. 704 - and described the ways in which that compromise has occurred. 55\nI\nThis testimony and the multiple fruits of the testimony would have been probative of key aspects of in\nI\nan ultimate issue of tact - the determination that the judiciary must inte_'ene and order the\nestablishment of a constitutional indigent defense system, s6\nI\nThe exclusion of this expert evidence affected a substantial right of Quitman. Miss. R.\nI\nEvid. 103(a). Without any citation to the record, the Circuit Court concluded that \"'the County has not\nI proven that the county-based system has resulted in the inability of the judiciary to operate in an\nindependent and effective manner.\" RE 3(Tr. Ct. Op. ¶ 83.) Had it been admitted, Mr. Farese's\nI\nexpert testimony that the system has undermined the integrity of the judicial system would have led to\nI the opposite conclusion.\nI\n._5 Introducing this evidence in the form of an expert opinion was proper because that opinion\nwould have assisted the Circuit Court \"to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"\nMiss.

See id. RE 16(Tr. 328-333).\nI\nI 33\n\nI\nI\nB. The Circuit Court's Reliance On Inadmissible Judicial Testimony Was Highly\nPrejudicial.\nI\nOver Quitman's repeated objections, the Circuit Court allowed the three Circuit Judges for\nI the 1lth Judicial District to testify, and offer opinions that the public defenders are \"competent\" and\n\"'effective advocates, even after telling Quitman to \"stay away from\" expert testimony on ultimate\nI\nquestions of fact. Extraordinarily, the Circuit Court then gave dispositive weight to these conclusory\nI\nopinions, which had little or no evidentiary foundation inthe record. RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶¶ 43, 45, 47,\n48, 79.) As described below, the judges acknowledged that the only bases for their opinions were\nI\ntheir observations in court, agreed that a large part of the most important work of a criminal defense\nI\nlawyer is done out of courl, and said that they had no idea what the public defenders did or did not do\noutside court. _7\nI\nWhen defendants announced pretrial that they intended to call sitting Circuit Judges to testify,\nI\nQuitman moved in limine to exclude the anticipated testimony. 58The Circuit Court acknowledged\nI that Quitman had \"legitimate concerns\" about the proposed testimony and that its claim goes to \"the\nvery, heart of our justice system,\" but nonetheless allowed the Circuit Judges to testify, subject to\nI\ncertain _mfidelines: that the judges could not be called as expert witnesses that their testimony could\nI not address particular cases, and that they could not offer legal opinions. Tr. 410-12. Nevertheless,\nI\nI\n57 Judges Albert Smith and Lawrence Lewis testified. The parties stipulated that Circuit Judge\nKenneth Thomas's testimony would be the same, except that heiwould not give testimony as a former\nI county prosecutor• RE 7 (Tr. 1037.) !\n5s Plaintiff's in limine motion demonstrated that the harm sucla,lestimlofly would do to the integrity\nof the fact-finding process in this case and to the administration _fjustice in other pending and future\n...... 1 I . .\nI criminal cases m the 1lth District greatly outweighs any mnmmal relevance testimony by judges\n• I\nabout their in-court observations could have and accordingly should have been excluded under\nMiss.

Rec. 28-35, 64-67;\nTr. 2-13, 21-23•\nI\nI 34\n\nI\nI\ndefense counsel sought to elicit opinions and, over objection, the judges were allowed to opine that\nI\nthe public defenders are competent and effective, s9\nI\nThe Circuit Court's decision allowing the judges to testify and to offer these opinions was\nerroneous. First, the opinions allowed by the Circuit Court violated its own guideline that the judges\nI\nare not expert witnesses and could not give expert opinions. The testimony of ajudge in a judicial\nI\nproceeding that a lawyer is\"'competent\" or \"'effective\" clearly is an expert opinion. 6° Although\ndefendants' counsel sometimes inlroduced questions with a reference to \"perceptions\" in an effort to\nI\nsuggest the testimony was lay opinion testimony, this Court has established a \"'bright line rule\"\nI\ndistinguishing lay opinion and expert testimony, where, \"'in order to express the opinion, the witness\nI must possess some experience or expertise beyond that of the average, randomly selected adult, it is a\nM.R.E. 702 opinion and not a 701 opinion.\" Langston v. Kidder, 670 So. 2d 1, 3-4 (Miss. 1995).\nI\n(citation omitted).\nI Second, even if these opinions were misconstrued as lay testimony, the Circuit Court erred by\nrelying on them to detemline what it regarded as the ultimate issue of fact - whether these individual\nI\nI so For example, the Circuit Court overruled an objection to the question \"are they zealot advocates\nfor their clients?\" and allowed Judge Smith to opine, \"They're competent.\" RE 6 (Tr. 719.)\nSimilarly, the Circuit Court overruled an objection to the question \"are they effective advocates for\nI their clients?\" and allowed Judge Lewis to opine that \"they are indeed effective\" and are \"'effective\"\nduring pleas. Tr. 916-17.917-18. The Circuit Court relied on these conclusory opinions in denying\nQuitman's request for declaratory and injunctive relief. RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶ 79.)\nI\n60 The judges who testified in this case clearly are not average, randomly selected adults and their\nopinions were sought because they have knowledge or information \"which is not likely to be\npossessed by a layman.\" May v. State, 524 So. 2d 957, 963 (Miss. 1988). The Circuit Court's failure\nI\nto recognize this distinction between lay and expert testimony allowed expert opinions to come in\nthrough the backdoor m......

State, 551 Serted 132, 144 (Miss., 1989). The error in\nallowing this subjective opinion testimony further compounded the Circuit Court's erroneous rulings\nprohibiting Steven Farese from giving his expert opinion that the county-based indigent defense\nsystem undermines the integrity of the court system, and ordering all of Quitman's experts to \"stay\naway\" from ultimate issues. Quitman thus was whipsawed by having improper lay opinion testimony\nused against it while at the same lime being barred from introducing proper expert opinion\ntestimony. \"l\nAs a result there is simply no evidentiary basis for the Circuit Court's sweeping conclusions.\nIndeed, although the Circuit Court premised its decision to allow the judges to testify on the\nassumption they could shed light on how the system in Quitman operates (Tr. 412), Judge Smith\ntestified that he does not \"know how the system is set up or operates or how the public defenders are\npaid. RE 6 (Tr. 726.) Since the judges could provide no specific factual testimony whether the\nsystem provides the tools of an effective defense, the Circuit Court chose to rely instead on\nconclusory opinions that the lawyers are \"competent\" or \"effective.\" This reliance isanother\nmanifestation of the Circuit Court's misunderstanding of the legal standard applicable to Quitman's\nsystemic challenge to the county-based system. See Point Iabove. At most, the judges have personal\n!\n\"knowledge of what they observe the lawyers doing in their courtroom.

R. Evid. 403 and tile canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct. _\nIV. THE CIRCUIT COURT ERRED BY IGNORING CREDIBLE' UNREBUTTED\nI\nEVIDENCE ESTABLISIIING QUITMAN COUNTY'S CLAIMS.\nThe Circuit Court ignored entire categories of experl and lay witness testimony, authoritative\nI\nstandards, government studies, and defense witness admissions establishing the key facts that this\nI\n0._ Judge Smith agreed that \"'a yew large pan\" of the work of a criminal defense lawyer in\nrepresenting a client is done out of court, that a criminal defense lawyer's out of court activities are\n\"very important,\" and nclude conmmnicating with the client communicating with the client's family\nI\nand friends, identi_,ing and inter,,iewing potential witnesses, and conducting legal research and\nanalysis to prepare for plea negotiations or trial. RE 6 (Tr. 728-37.) He agreed that these activities\ncan be \"very time consuming,\" and that he has no personal knowledge of them. RE 6 (Tr. 728,\nI\n737-38.) Similarly, Judge Lewis testified that he has no personal knowledge whether public\ndefenders investigate their cases, attempt to negotiate pleas with the District Attorney or\ncommunicate with their clients before entering a guilty plea or going to trial. Tr. 918-19.\nI\n_,3 The Circuit Court placed considerable weight on a scripted exchange of questions and answers\n(PX 29) that is supposed to occur before entry, of a guilt',, plea. RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ¶ 78.) Judge Smith\nI testified that he does not use PX 29. RE 3(Tr. 725.) Judge Lewis testified that he uses a form of plea\nagreement (PX 28) already filled in, signed by the defendant and filed with the clerk before he ever\nsees it. Tr. 918. The expert witnesses, Mr. Former and Mr. Bright, testified that such form \"plea\nI dialogues\" do not alleviate concerns about representation in light of the evidence that attorney-client\ncommunications, investigation and plea negotiations are lacking. Mr. Fonner's expert opinion is that\nsuch \"dialogues\" provide no evidence the attorney did any work on the case or that there has been\nmeaningful discussion and consultation. RE 16(Tr. 404-05). Mr( Bright's expert opinion isthat the\nI\nlack of investigation and an independent examination of the faeis cannot be cured by the exchange\npreceding the plea. RE 18(Tr. 765.) The Circuit Court fails to _nention this expert testimony.\nI t,4 . .

This Courl has long held that it isreversible error\nI\nfor a trial court to ignore uncontradicted evidence. 65\nI\nA. The Circuit Court Committed Reversible Error by Ignoring Pivotal Expert and\nLay Witness Testimony.\nI I. Statewide Failures in Indigent Defense Systems.\nUndisputed expert and lay witness testimony established that the county-based system fails to\nI\nprovide the tools of an adequate defense statewide. Many public defenders throughout the state do\nI not file pretrial motions, use experts or invest tile time necessary to represent their indigent clients\neffectively. RE 16 (Tr. 353.) They have no administrative or investigative support and lack\nI\noversight. RE 4 (Tr. 592.) Public defenders do not use investigators, have very little contact with\nI\ntheir clients, and file irrelevant motions that rely oll outdated legal research. RE 4 (Tr. 588-590.) _°\nThe Circuit Court's opinion does not address the statewide failures to provide the essential tools of an\nI\nadequate defense.\nI\n2. Failure to Provide Adeql,ate Defense Tools in Quitman County.\nThe Circuit Court ignored testimony that defense tools are not being provided in Quitman:\nI\nI\n05 See Lucedale Veneer Co. v.Rogers, 53 So. 2d 69, 75 (Miss. 1951) (\"[E]vidence which is not\ncontradicted by positive testimony or circumstances, and is not inherently improbable, incredible, or\nI unreasonable, cannot be arbitrarily or capriciously discredited, disregarded, or rejected...\");\nTarwer v. Lindsey, 137 So. 93, 96 (lVliss. 1931) (\"Where, as in this case, the testimony of witnesses is\nundisputed, is reasonable in itself,.., and the witnesses are unimpeached, then the trier of facts must\nact on the testimony and cannot reject it, else trials might eventuate in arbitrary results...\");\nI\nHohnes v. Holmes, 123 So. 865 (Miss. 1929) (reversing lower court's dismissal where trial court\nignored both the undisputed testimony of a clerk with direct personal knowledge of the transaction at\nissue, as well as a letter written by,defendant containing important admissions).\nI L\n66 The evidence of statewide deficiencies was not disputed at trial. Indeed, defendants' own\nwitnesses testified to the same effect. For example, District At(orney Mellen testified that\nI arraignment-day guilty pleas are entered in other counties. RE 7 (Tr. 1018.) Assistant Attorney\nGeneral White admitted that investigative and expert services ts'pically are not provided by the state\nto indigent criminal defendants in Mississippi. PX 50B at 246.\nI\nI 38\n\nI\nI\n-- Defendants do not recognize the lawyers appointed to represent them at arraignment, and\nprisoners sit injail up to 4 to 5 months without any lawyer contact• Tr. 542, RE 5\nI (703-04), RE 18(767, 806).\n- Client meetings are held in _oups in the courtroom within earshot of the prosecutor and\nI the judge. RE 7(Tr. 1008, 1017-18.)\n- Public defenders routinely waive preliminary hearings, accept facts in indictments, and\ndo not ask for investigators or experts. Tr. 444, 506-07, 563.\nI\n- There is no opportunity for the investigation or communication necessary to make an\ninformed decision when pleas are entered on arraignment day. RE 4 (Tr. 591.)\nI\n-- There isa vast disparity between the resources of the State and public defenders. See\npp. 9-21 above.\nI\nNone of this evidence is even acknowledged in the Circuit Court's opinion.\nI B. The Circuit Court Ignored Governmental Studies and Authoritative Standards\nUsed to Assess The Effectiveness of Defense Provided.\nI 1. Governmental Studies Established Statewide Defense Failures.\nGovernmental studies repeatedly have found the tools of adequate defense are lacking• Thus,\nI\nthe Spangenberg studies found that \"'funding for indigent defense is totally inadequate,\" \"'the lack of\nI adequate resources for indigent defense services results in poor quality sen'ices and representation,\"\n\"'there is no statewide oversight of indigent defense, which leads to a hodgepodge, county-by-county\nI\napproach to providing services\" and \"[e]very aspect of defense representation iscompromised.\" App.\nI Ex. 1.67 The Circuit Court's opinion does not refer to these repeated findings of inadequate\nrepresentation by these highly reputable bodies.\nI\nI\nI\nI\n67 Similarly, the Mississippi Public Defenders Task Force reiaort concluded that \"indigent defense\nremained a vexing problem for the counties\" and compiled deeigly tr0ub!,ing reports by several Senior\nCircuit Judges describing systemic i•nadequacies• they have obserived,mI!..t..he_r districts. RE 8,\nI\nAttachment C); Tr. 126-27. The subsequent report by the Stud), Commission on the Mississippi\nJudicial System likewise found that \"the present system of relying on appointments of part-time\ndefenders is woefully inadequate and burdensome on the counties.\" RE 9 (PX at 31.)\nI\nI 39\n\nI\nI\n2. Authoritative Standards of Adequate Criminal Defense.\nI The experts testified that the criteria identified by the American Bar Association and National\nLegal Aid and Defender Association for criminal defense representation are essential to providing an\nI\nadequate defense and Quitman's trial presentation and brief extensively reviewed those standards,\nI\nwhich provide objective guidance inevaluating whether the tools of defense are provided. See\nApp. RE 20. The Circuit Court failed entirely to acknowledge the standards or the expert testimony\nI\nconcerning them. This disregard had important practical effects. For example, the evidence showed\nI\nthat the public defenders have more felony cases than the maximum recommended by national\nstandards. PX 48. Mr. Bright's expert opinion was that public defenders could no! .handle their large\nI\ncaseloads adequately given the lack of investigative support. RE 18(Tr. 753-754). The Circuit\nI\nCourt gave no heed to these objective standards and expert evidence, instead relying on the public\ndefenders\" subjective impressions. 6s\nI\nC. The Circuit Court Ignored Admissions from Defendants\" Witnesses.\nI\nThe Circuit Court iguored key admissions by the State's witnesses, including admissions by\nDistrict Attorney Mellen showing a breakdown of the advocacy system, including (I) that the District\nI\nAttorney withdraws plea offers if a defense attorney makes a motion he deems \"frivolous; (2)\nI\nQuitman public defenders do not create problems for the District Attorney and \"'we all get along\"\nI\nt,s The Circuit Court's disregard of these authoritative standards also is reflected in its decisions to\nrepeatedly overrule Quitman's objections to the illusory distinction the State attempted to draw during\nI\nits cross-examination of Mr. Farese between authoritative standards and so-called \"minimum\nrequirements\" for defense. The Circuit Court erred by allov_ing the State to question Mr. Farese\nabout hypothetical minimums, instead of the objective and authoritative standards identified by the\nI\nexperts. This error had an important substantive effect because it required Quitman to change its\nstrategy in order to deal with the supposed and unsubstantiat'ed:\"minimums.\" Tr. 621,650, 653.\nThis too was reversible error, compounded by the other evidentiary errors made by the Court during\nI the trial. See Jenkins v. State, 607 So.2d 1171, 1183-84 (Miss. 1992) (\"This Court has often ruled\nthat errors in the lower court that do not require reversal standing alone may nonetheless taken\ncumulatively require reversal.\").\nI\nI 40\n\nI\nI\nRE 7 (Tr. 1004-05, 1011-12, 1021): (3) public defenders do not look at the prosecutor's file before\nI\npleading their clients guilty; (4) they often accept pleas \"within a matter of minutes\": (5) public\nI\ndefenders look at the file only after the agreements are finalized to \"legitimize\" the plea RE 7\n(Tr. 1005-07, 1018. 1020-21): and (6) District Attorneys and the courts encourage indigent\nI\ndefendants to plead on arraignment day because it is more \"convenient.\" RE 7(Tr. 1021.)\nI\nThe Circuit Court also ignored the dramatic admission of Appropriations Chairnlan Capps in\nresponse to questions about the Public Defender Task Force's recommendation to create a Division of\nI\nIndigent Appeals. Representative Capps unequivocally answered that he would not support the\nI\nsmallest step toward creating sucll a division -- \"l'm not going to support anything that costs nothing.\nNothing.\" PX 51B at 46-47. Had the Circuit Court had considered these admissions and the other\nI\nevidence described above, it could not have concluded that the county-based system provides the\nI\ntools of defense or that the Legislature can be counted on to correct the problems plaguing the system.\nI The Circuit Court committed reversible error by ignoring this uncontradicted evidence.\nFinally, the Circuit Court's decision goes against the weight of the evidence in this case. This\nI\nCourt should therefore reverse tile Circuit Court's judgment as arbitrary, unsubstantiated by the\nI\nrecord, and manifestly unjust. See Tunner v. State, 764 So.2d 385,393 (Miss. 2000) (reversal\nwarranted if factual findings are clearly erroneous or against the overwhelming weight of the\nI\nevidence); Jackson v. Daley, 739 So.2d 103 I, 1042 (Miss. 1999)(same).\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI 41\n\nI\nI\nV* THE CIRCUIT COURT IMPROPERLY INVOKED THIS COURT'S PRIOR\nDISSENT AND PERSONAL OPINION IN FAILING TO ORDER A STATEWIDE\nI INDIGENT DEFENSE SYSTEM IN LIGHT OF THE BREAKDOWN OF THE\nINTEGRITY OF THE ADVERSARY SYSTEM.\nI A° The Judicial Obligation to Follow the Law Does Not Permit A Court to Invoke\nPersonal Opinion or Bias in Fashioning A Remedy for Constitutional Violations.\nIn reaching the conclusion that a statewide system need not be implemented despite\nI\nQuitman's \"constitutional dilemmas\" tile Circuit Court expressed a personal opinion, invoking this\nI\nCourt's prior Dissent in Quitman:\nI This Court agrees with the sentiments expressed by three justices in\nthe dissenting opinion in State v. Quitman CounO,, 807 So. 2d at413\n(Pittman, C.J., dissenting):\nI\n\"'Iagree that it would be wise of the Legislature to create and fund a\nslatewide public defenders' office. However, the Legislature has\nattempted to solve the problem of indigent defense in other ways.\nI\nBy its actions the Legislature has shown that it isnot blind to the\nplight of Quitman County. It is the Legislature which holds the key\nto solving these problems, not this Court by impressive and\nI excessive exercise of judicial authority.\"\nRE 3,(Op. at 27,¶ 84.)\nI\nThis was plain error. This Court held earlier this month that \"'[n]o credible person could\nI\ndispute that having impartial judges is a compelling state interest.\" Mississq_pi Commission on\nJudicial Peffbrmance v. 11\"71kerson,-- So. 2d --, 2004 WL 1471110, No. 2002-J P-02105 SCT (Miss.\nI\nJuly I, 2004). 69 Judges act contrary to these policies when they base judicial opinions on material\nI\noutside the scope of prevailing law. By expressing \"'agreement\" with and directly quoting the\nDissent, Judge Lamar injected an unfortunate note of personal opinion into a decision of statewide\nI\nI\n!\n¢,o Canon 3A of the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct rec uires that judges \"be faithful to the\nlaw.'\"\nI\n42\nI\n\nI\nI\nsimaificance and constitutional import, and contrary to the expressed view of the majority of the\nI\nQuitman Court. 7°\nI Bo Quitman and Hosford Provide this Court with the Authorit)' to Order A\nStatewide, State Funded System.\nI Because Quitman County proved the necessary factual predicates, this Court has the inherent\nauthority to order as a remedy that the State implement a statewide public defender system:\nI\nThe question raised by the County's allegations is whether,\nassuming the State has failed in its duty to provide effective indigent\nI defense, the county-based system has resulted inthe inability of the\njudiciary to operate in an independent and effective manner to the\nextent that this Courl mltst, ofnecessiO', interfere in this traditionally\nlegislative function and order the Legis&ture to establish a\nI\nstatewide, stateffitnded system of indigent criminal defense. Again,\ntaking as true the well-pied allegations of the County's complaint,\nsuch systemic constitutional deficiencies would entitle the County to\nI\nrelief.\nQuitman, 807 So. 2d at410 (emphasis added).\nI\nIt is clear from this decision that Quitman need not first demonstrate that there is no\nI\nalternative recourse to ordering a statev,,ide system -- rather, such a remedy is proper simply \"_where\nthe Legislature l'ails to act\" and as a result it\"'fails to fulfill a constitutional obligation to enable the\nI\nI\nI\n70 Although judicial \"'critical or disaproving:' of a party's position do not ordinarily support a\nfinding of bias or prejudice, where they \"reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to\nI\nmake fair judgment impossible,\" a challenge to impartiality may be appropriate. Litelo., v. United\nStates, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994) (construing federal recusal statute). Reliance on an extrajudicial\nsource in ruling on the merits of this case is one of the primary indic:ia of partiality; in fact, the United\nI • _ [j . .\nStates Supreme Court has deemed reliance on extrajudicial sources m oplmons to be sufficiently\nsuspect as to be among the factors in recusal jurisprudence. Litek3..,,510_U.S. at 554-55 (1994).\nReliance on information '\"other than what the judge has learned from h_s participation in the case'\"\nI has been determined to be evidence of bias or prejudice meriting recusal.

Any holding otherwise would\nemasculate the constitutional mandate for three separate and co-\nequal branches of government by reducing courts to supplicants only\nI of the Legislature.\nI\n71 In reaching its decision, this Court invoked the long line of Mississippi cases recognizing the\njudiciary's inherent authority to act, and noted that, while the \"expenditure of funds\" for the purpose\nI\nof indigent defense is\"'in most instances\" a legislative affair, the Court has had to act on several\noccasions to remedy the \"'Legislature's failure to allocate sufficient funds,\" Id. at 409, for example,\nFuller v.

For example, Mr. Farese testified that it is\nI\ninherent in the system that Mississippi's public defenders are overworked and understaffed, and he\nI characterized the system as \"designed to fail.''73\nNumerous witnesses also testified that the system is insufficiently independent. Based upon\nI\ntestimony by the public defenders, Mr. Farese testified that the county-based system has resulted ina\nI\nprosecutorial system in which defense attorneys are afraid to ask judges for money because doing so\ncould affect their very livelihood. He noted that itshould \"'shock our legal conscience\" that the courts\nI\nare so heavily involved in the hiring decisions involving public defenders.

The undisputed evidence from the Circuit Courl established that a statev,,ide system is\nI\neconomically feasible, is part of this State's \"'fundamental obligation\" recognized by Gideon v.\nHZainwright and Conn. v.

It contains accounts of legal representation so deficient as to\nmake a mockery of the concept of equal justice under the law.  The report also highlights the hidden costs to\ncounties and taxpayers that inevitably accompany an outdated and broken-down system of justice.\nIn an effort to raise awareness about the crisis in indigent defense in Mississippi, the NAACP Legal Defense and\nEducational Fund, Inc. (LDF) has undertaken a comprehensive study of the public defender system. LDF staff and\ncooperating attorneys interviewed over 150 current and former criminal defendants, observed court proceedings\nin ten counties, and consulted with public defenders, district attorneys, judges, county supervisors, sheriffs, and\ncommunity members from around the State. \nLDF’s findings demonstrate that, although the State has a constitutional duty to assure equal justice to rich and\npoor alike, in Mississippi justice is available only to those with the means to pay for it. And sadly, our country’s\nshameful history of racial discrimination is still readily apparent in the low quality representation provided to the\nState’s poor, predominately black defendants. Forty years after the Supreme Court’s decision in Gideon v.\nWainwright, the State of Mississippi continues to ignore its mandate to provide constitutionally adequate counsel\nfor the poor.1\nFebruary 2003\nThis report is based on research conducted by LDF cooperating attorney Sarah Geraghty. She and LDF assis-\ntant counsel Miriam Gohara are co-authors of the report.

It would be a long wait. Court records show\nthat Chester sat in jail for 11 months before a lawyer was appointed to look into the facts\nof her case. No discovery motion was filed until a year after the offense. And she never\nactually talked to a lawyer about the crime for which she was arrested until 13 months\nafter the incident. In fact, the first time she spoke to the lawyer assigned to defend her\nwas in court on the day her case was supposed to go to trial. In June of 2002, nearly 14\nmonths after her arrest, Chester pled guilty to misdemeanor shoplifting and was released\nfrom the jail.\nChester’s indictment charged her with taking a clock radio, a walkman, and a package\nof batteries from the WalMart, valued at approximately $72.

That\nwas January 1998. More than four-and-a-half years later, he and his two co-defendants2were still\nin the county jail waiting for their day in court. It was eight months before any of the defendants\nwere arraigned. Then came multiple changes in attorneys, and multiple requests to postpone hear-\nings. Add to that a docket jam-packed with cases, and judges who handle more than 1,000 cases\nper year–the highest volume in the State.   \nIn the end, the taxpayers of Harrison County paid more than $150,000 to incarcerate the three\ndefendants, only for a judge to dismiss the case against them. The boys’ confessions were illegal-\nly coerced and could not be used at trial; without them, there was insufficient evidence to link the\ndefendants to the crime. On August 16, 2002, the defendants, now men, were released from the\njail.\nProsecutors and defense attorneys disagree about why it took so long to reach this result. But they\ndo agree on two things. First, that the defendants, the victim’s family and the community paid a\nhigh price for this delay in the justice system. And second, that an adequately funded public\ndefender program would ease docket congestion, make the administration of criminal justice in\nHarrison County more efficient, and prevent similar miscarriages of justice in the future.3\n\n5\n\nASSEMBLY LINE JUSTICE: Mississippi’s Indigent Defense Crisis 6\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nIn the United States of America, everyone accused of a time in jail awaiting trial than they spend serving the sentence\nfelony crime is entitled to a lawyer.

A statewide public defender system should be established similar to the one envisioned by the\nnow-repealed Mississippi Statewide Public Defender System Act of 1998.

It should also provide training for public defenders and ensure that they have effective access to inde-\npendent, qualified investigators, experts, and other support.\n4.

An objective statewide standard for determining whether defendants are indigent, and thus eligible for appointment of coun-\nsel, should be established.\n7.

MISCELLANEOUS\n19\nStudy Commission on the Mississippi Judicial System, Report to the Mississippi Legislature\n|\n!\nI\n-ii-\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe crux of Mississippi's defense of its current system of indigent defense is that\nin fulfilling its duty to provide \"effeclive legal represenlation al the public's expense,\" the\nState may \"'experinlent\" in flmding a manner to provide that defense. Appellee's Br. at 4.\nBut experimentation is not abrogation, and Mississippi's more than forty years of\n\"experiments\" with the lives and liberty of its poor citizens has lasted far too long.\nQuitman County demonstrated at trial that Mississippi's current patchwork system of\nfunding indigent defense simply cannot do !.hejob; it cannot provide poor defendants\naccused of a crime with even the selnblance of an effective defense pursuant to the\nrequiremei_ts of Corm v. State, 170 So.2d 20 (Miss. 1964) or Gideon v. Wainwright, 372\nU.S. 335 (1963). As a result, this Court should reaffirm the principles it set forth most\nrecently in Quitman v. State, 807 $o.2d 401 (Miss. 2001) and older a statewide, slate-\nfimded system of indigent defense in Mississippi.\nARGUMENT\nI. MISSISSIPPI, LIKE THE CIRCUIT COURT, IGNORES THE RECORD\nEVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING TltAT QUITMAN COUNTY CANNOT\nPROVIDE EFFECTIVE INDIGENT DEFENSE.\nAt trial, Quitlnan County presented ovcrwhehning evidence -tactual,\ndocumentary, statistical and expert - proving that the defense routinely and systematically\nprovided to its poor citizens is inadequate to secure their constitutional rights.\nAdditionally, Quitman County demonstrated through statewide studies and surveys that\nindigent defense in many other Mississippi counties systematically fails to meet\nconstitutional obligations.\nMoreover, Quilman demonst,ated that it is Mississippi'sfimding sl'stem itself that\nhas resulted in constitutionally inadequate defense for the poor in counties around the state\n\nI\nI\nI (and particularly poor rt,ral counties like Quitman). Much of the evidence Quitman\nCounty presented was either ignored or discounted by the Circuit Court, and likewise has\nI\nbeen disregarded by Mississippi iraits argument on appeal. When properly considered,\nI\nthis evidence requires that the trial cot,rt decision be reversed and that pursuant to the\nstandards set forth in Quitman. a statewide, state-funded indigent defense be implemented.\nI\nA. The Circuit Court Ignored the Significance of the Statistical and Case-\nby-Case Evidence of Inadequate Indigent Defense in Quitman Count3'.\nI\nThe Circuit Court and the State in this appeal attempt to make much of Quitman\nI\nCounty's supposed lack of proof that particular defendants received constitutionally\nineffective defense under Stricklamt v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) or Simon v. State,\nI\n857 So.2d 668 (Miss. 2003). Indeed, the State argues that it is\"commou sense\" that these\nI\ncases should have governed the proof to be presented at trial. AppeIlee's Br. at 22. That\nargument entirely misses the point of this Court's decision in Quitman v. State- that in a\n!\nprospective indigent defense case (as opposed to a post-conviction appeal) the trial court is\nI\nrequired to assess whether the \"tools\" of an effective indigent defense are provided and\nI not simply look at the end-result of an inadequate defense ira a particular case. The state's\nStricklamt argument also ignores the substantial and highly significant statistical proof\nill\nQuitman presented by painstakingly analyzing case-by-case all of the public defender\n!1\ncases for indicia of effective representation. For example, Quitman demonstrated\nconclusively that the public defenders routinely and systematically pied their clients guilty\ng\non the day of arraignment without first providing any semblance oflhe\"tools\"ofan\nI\neffective defense. Indeed, between February 1995 and March 20(13, fully 57% of all\nguilty pleas involving the Quitman County public defenders were entered on the verydav\nI\nI\n-2-\n\nI\nI\nI of the arraignment. RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. _131) RE 11. During that same period over 40% of\nall public defender cases in Quitman pled guilty on the day of arraignment. Id.\nI\nThe significance of this evidence cannot be nlinimized. It de,nonstrates that the\ni\nQuitman County public defenders, who first meet their clients on the day of arraignnlent,\ndo little or no case pret)aration before advising their clients to plead guilty. Indeed, the\nI\nDistrict Attorney admitted that he gives the public defenders their client's file after they\nI\nhave purportedly advised on a disposition \"to legitimize maybe their suggestion to their\nclient.\" RE 7 (Tr. 1018). District Attorney Mellen also conceded thai public defenders\nI\noften receive his plea offers and accept on behalf of their clients' significant sentences\nI\n\"within a ,hatter of minutes. '• RE 7 (Tr. 1020-21). Defenders at trial testified that they\nI believed it was proper to rely on the prosecution 'stile. RE 7 (Tr. 1003-4), Tr. 856-58,\n515. One of the public defenders actually testified that this was done pursuant to a\nI\n\"gentleman's agreement • _t\"th ihe prosecution. Tr. 515. Moreover, this extraordinary\nI level ofarraig,nuent day pleas also demonstrates that the Quitman County public\ndefenders do virtually no investigation or motion practice to improve their clients'\ni\nstrategic position before advising on a case disposition.\ni\nIn fact, Quitman demonstrated through statistical analysis and other proof that this\nlack of motion practice and strategic case development pervades all of the public defense\n!\nwork in Quitman. Notably• public defenders filed no substantive motions (i.e., ,notions\ni\nI\nI\nI\n-3-\n\notherthan for substitution of counsel or foma discovery) in almost 85% of eases between\n2001 and March 2003. RE 14; RE 16 (Tr. 350-51). I\nPerhaps even worse, the public defense system provides defenders with\ndisincentives to file strategic or substantive motions and to investigate adequately a\nclient's defense. Remarkably, District Attorney Mellen testified that it is his practice to\nwithdraw a plea offer ifa defense attorney were to make a motion t'or a psychological or\npsychiatric evaluation, or indeed any such motion he would consider \"frivolous.\" RE 7\n(Tr. 1011-1012,1021).\nThe entire structure of the defense system also undenlfines any possibility of an\neffective defense. First, as a poor county, Quitman begins with the st,uctural handicap of\nholding only two trial sessions per year. As a result, Quitman defendants may spend many\nmonths in jail prior to arraignment or trial. And yet, as the defenders testified, they did\nnot see themselves as having a_o: attorney-client relationship with their clients from a\nJustice Court initial appearance to the awaignment in Circuit Court - a critical\ninvestigation phase in which the client is utterly without counsel as guaranteed by law. Tr.\n475, Tr. 508-509. Even the defenders find this \"gap\" in the system to be \"'troubling.\" Tr.\n475. Of course, the State and the Circuit Court made littlc note of this fact, because it is\nboth objectively startling evidence of the inadequacy of the system, and because it\ndemonstrates the lack ofattentioll public defenders show towards their clients dttring\ncritical phases of the case when a case needs prompt and thorough investigation and\ni Further evidencing the negligible motion practice.of the public defenders, Mr. Tisdell\nadmitted for the record that the only motion to suppress he filed in Quitmau (that the state\nhad identified) was for a private client. Tr. 877.\n-4-\n\nI\nI\nI presentation of the evidence that may favor the defense. In addition, the fact that public\ndefenders appear at Justice Court but titan are not actually appointed until the Circuit\nI\nCourt demonstrates one further point: tile courts in Quitman are simply a \"processing\"\nI\nsystem for the poor. See Tr. 752-56. Tills is not surprising in a system where the public\ndefenders serve more titan one county, are permitted private caseloads and outside\nI\nemployment, and serve countics with more extensive caseloads such as Tunica. The result\nI\nis that the public defenders, even witllout timir Justice Court caseloads, exceed\nsubstantially the maxinmm standard caseload recommended by professional standard-\nI\nsetting bodies. 2\nI\nMoreover, the facts that caseloads are clearly excessive by recognized objective\nstandards and that Circuit Court sessions last only a few weeks a year fimher encourage\nI\ndefenders to plead their clients guilty to enhance their time for other - and often more\nI\nlucrative-opportunities. As District Attorney Mellen testified, the system encourages\nI pleas on the day of arraignment because it is \"convenient\" and administratively easier to\nresolve cases on the day when all parties and the court are present. RE 7 (Tr. 1020-21).\nI\nQuitman's process-oriented structure results in some \"bizarre\" and disturbing\nI\npractices, as the evidence at trial demonstrated. Tr. 753-756. First, clients accept felony\npleas based upon categories of cases rather than the particular facts and circumstances of\n!\nthe alleged offense. RE 7 (Tr. 1005-07). Second, clients receive little or no \"infommd\n|\nl\n2See National Ad`',isory Committce on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, RE 15 at\nMS 03843. Ivlr. Shackelford's and Mr. Tisdell's Circuit Court felony caseloads average\n164 and 169 respectively, without appeals and private cases, ,.,.,ell in excess of the\ng\nmaximum recommendcd caseload of 150. PX4.\ni\n-5-\n\nI\nI\nI advice\" prior toward making what can be the most critical decision of their lives. 3 Third,\nbecause any advice that is given occurs on tile very day and in the very courtroom where a\nI\ndisposition is retadered, such counsel occurs under circumstances that can only fairly be\ni\ndescribed as duress. Indeed, as the public defenders conceded and witnesses testified,\npublic defenders actually advise clients in groups provided that they would \"admit[ ] their\nI\nguilt.\" Tr. 559-60. This creates a \"chaotic\" situation where some clients do not even\ni\nrecognize their lawyer, and a central hallmark of our judicial system, tile attorney-client\nprivilege, is absent. RE 5 (Tr. 703-05). Indeed, the Qtfilman arraigmnent day ptvcessing\nI\nwas so troubling that a local minister found it necessary to create a \"'court ministry\" to\nI\nwitness the arraignments and advocate for the accused. RE 5 (Tr. 700-02, 708).\nI Finally, statistical evidence also demonstrated at trial that those cases that do\nproceed beyond arraignment day and are set for trial receive little more attention. For tile\nI\neight percent of felony cases that do go to trial, trials are scheduled only a few weeks after\ni\nthe public defender is first appointed at arraignment. RE 5, RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ]133). Any\ninvestigation dt,ring this period is likely to be based upon stale infonllation or infomlation\nI\nthat is obtained fi'om the prosecution file. RE 7 (Tr. 1003-04). And unlike the typical\nI\npublic defender office or even the prosecution, public defenders in Quitman have no\nindependent investigators.\nI\nI\n3 Refening to the pattern of accepting pleas on the day of arraignment Mr. DeGruy\nI\nasserted \"when you have so many occurring on the same date, that causes concena and\nraises a red flag because you cannot have adequate communication with your client. You\nI cannot have a 15 minute conversation with your client on a criminal felony and know all\nthat you know.\" Tr. 628.\nI\n-6-\n\nIndeed,inadditionto simply relying on the prosecution's one-sided file, defenders\nactually used the Sheriff's office to find witnesses. 4Tr. 539. Moreover, two defenders\nconceded they had never asked for apt investigator in a noncapital trial, and a third\nindicated that his one request for such an investigation was smnmarily denied. Tr. 564,\n517; Appellant's Br. at 18. And as to expert services, which the courts have recognized\ncan be a critical tool of effective representation, 5one defender did not know what an\n\"outside expert\" was and only one of the three defenders since 1990 had ever requested an\nexpert in a noncapital case. Tr. 876. Where there have been psychiatric or forensic\nevahmtions by the defense in Quitman, they have been through state experts or the state\ncrime lab. Tr. 532,534, RE (Tr. Ct. Op. 432), RE 18 (Tr. 773-74,775-776), RE10.\nThus, when looking at the overwhelming statistical evidence from case-by-case\nanalyses of felony cases in Quitman County, together with the testimony and admissions\nofthe District Attorney and public defenders themselves, there can be no question that\nQuitman County indigent defendants simply have not been provided with the tools of an\neffective and constitutional defense.\nB. The Trial Court and Mississippi Ignore the Weight of the Evidence of\nThe Systematic Failure to Provide Effective Indigent Defense.\nLacking any substantive response to the evidence introduced by Quitman as to the\nctu'onic constitutional effectiveness of its system for providing indigent defense, the State\nargues (1) that other states are no better; (2) that the Quitman caseload in particular (of the\n4 During trial Deputy Sheriff Silns attested to assisting the defende,'s in locating indigent\nclients and witnesses citing the reason for such activity as \"generosity and\ncourtesy...because we know that they're short of man power.\" Tr. 539-40. Mr. Bright\ncalled this behavior \"bizarre.\" Tr. 755.\n5See .41,-ev. Oklahoma, 470'U.S. 68 (1985).\n-7-\n\nI\nI\nI several counties served by the defenders) is not particularly excessive; (3) that the judges\nand defenders defended their own provision of services; (4) that resources- salary, expert,\nI\nforensic, and the like - were readily available to the defenders had such resources been\ni required; (5) that pleas and guilty verdicts are commensurate with other jurisdictions; and\n(6) thai problems such as the lack of independence of the defenders from the judiciary,\nI\ndelays in processing cases, and gaps in representation and short time preparation times do\nI\nnot constitute constitutional ineffectiveness attributable to the county-based system itself.\nSee Appellees' Br. 13-17.\nI\nThese points all miss the mark. This case is about Mississippi's county-based\nI\nsystem of indigent defense, no! lhat ofolher states, and whether other states have similar\nor di fferently structured systems is of little relevance to tile case before this Court. It is\nI\npertinen.t to hole, however, that a marked trend towards statewide public defender\nI\norganizations and systems has also been accompanied by recent substantial litigation in\nI other slates around lhe country where county-based or appointed systems still exist. 6\nMoreover, tile State's own exhibit introduced at trial refuted its claims that the majority of\nI\nstates fund indigent defense with state and county funds. The Bureau of Justice Statistics\nii\nits cites actually support the County's case, by noting that in a 1999 study 21 states\nprovided 90% or more of fiinding for indigent criminal defense, while only 11 provided\n|\n1(10% at funding. Furthermore, tile report reflects that 27 states use primarily state-funded\n|\nor completely stale flmded systems as compared to the mere 17 that use completely county\nor primarily counly fimds, far fiom a majority. DXI.\nI\nI\n6See, e.g., Anderson v. Louisiana. No. 2004-5405 (La. Dist. Ct. filed Sept. 23. 2004).\nI\n-8-\n\nI\nI\nI Second, the public defenders who serve Quitman County in addition to other more\npopulous counties have excessive felony caseloads by any objective standard, and yet the\nI\ncounty-based part-time defender system still results in their taking additional private cases\nI\nand other work beyond their Circuit Court, appellate, and Justice Court matters. It is this\nfundamental built-in structural flaw in the part-time public defender system that results in\nI\nthe systematic undermining and underprovision of the tools of an effective defense.\nI\nThird, that the public defenders - who find their jobs to be lucrative while leaving\nfree time for their ministry, fishing, \"girl watching,\" real estate-investing and the like -\nI\ntestified to their own competence is neither surprising nor relevant in light of the extensive\nI\nevidence at trial of the system's failure to provide the tools of an effective defense.\nI Moreover, that the judges who oversee the processing of defendants on arraignment day\nbelieve that the representation they see is not ineffective is hardly surprising. As the\nI\nDistrict Attorney and public defenders admitted, the system is designed so that there is\ni little investigation, little controversy, they \"work real well with\" and \"get along with\" each\nother, and the utter lack of independence or any meaningful balancing of the prosecution\nI\nand defense leaves only the defendants worse for wear. Tr. 1004-05, 1021, 1018.\nI\nBut more importantly, the non-expert testimony of the judges, peculiarly credited\nby the Circuit Judge over the expert testimony of nationally and statewide-prominent\nI\ndefense experts, simply was beside the point. All of the key tools of an effective pre-trial\nI\ndefense - investigation, research, advice and counsel, negotiation, expert and forensic\nconsultation and trial preparation-take place outsideofthe purview of the court. As the\ni\n|\nI\n-9-\n\nI\nI\ni judges readily admitted, they were not and should not be privy to the provision of these\ntools ol'adequate indiget_t defense, v\nI\nWitll regard to resources available to the public defenders, Mississippi claims that\nI\nthe public defender salaries ($1350 per,nonth, per defender) are fully adequate in light of\nthe caseload of the County. But it is crystal cleat that such salaries are simply not\nI\nadequate to keep the defenders from taking appointments in other counties, private cases,\n!\nand even sideline occupations. Moreover, these \"salaries'\" are a misnomer because riley\nare structL_red to cover office supplies, overi_ead and all of the investigative and other costs\nI\nand services that public defenders may provide, s Tr. 448-50; RE 6 (Tr. 337). Clearly, tile\nI\ndefender's compensation is reduced to tlae extent i_e devotes any portion of this sum to\nI client services, only aggravating the disparity of resources between tl_e proscct,tion and\ndefense. RE 15 at MS 03868-69.\nI\nThe built-in structural disadvantages of a part-time system ti_at encourage the\nI taking of other work and the underutilization of financial resources on behalf of clients in\nl:avor of added personal income tbr the defender, render tile State's argument chime,'ical.\nI\nThe undeniable statistical evidence presented by Quitman County from a case-by-case\ni\nanalysis of the defenders' felony dockets demonstrates that they do no or virtually no\ninvestigation, negotiation, motion practice or even confidential counseling and advice.\nI\n7Tr. 728. Judge Smith repeatedly affimaed that he did not observe anyofthe\"out-of-\n! court\" activities oftlae defenders, ld. Thus he was unable to offer testimony on this\ncrucial point.\n8 As the Mississippi Public Defender Commission report states it is the county's\nI\nresponsibility to provide office space, secretarial assista_lce at_d other operating expenses\nfor public defenders. Yet the commission did not \"encounter a single parl-time cont,act\npublic det'ender that received this minimal operating support fi'om the annual salary.\" (PX\nI\n1at MS 02838).\nI\n-10-\n\ni\nI\nI Similarly, tile State's argument that other jurisdictions have comparable rates of\nguilty pleas or convictions is entirely iwelevant. The crux of Quitman's statistical proof\nI\nwas that a high percentage of cases in Quitman pied on the date of arraignment, typically\nI oil tile same day the defender met the client, with typically no prior file review by the\ndefender, with no motions or negotiations, and based upon the category of the offense\nI\nrather than tile client's circumstances. How often other jurisdictions plead or convict\nI\ndefendants simply cannot address these flaws in Qtfitmail's and Mississippi's county-\nbased system.\nI\nFinally, where the Circuit Court and the State concede flaws in the system, they\nI\nquickly move the target by claiming that such flaws have nothing to do with tile adequacy\nof the county-based system itself. And yet it cannot be denied that the justice system is\nI\nshaped as a whole by the poverty that pervades county governments and that the meet-\ni\nand-plead processing there reflects tile realities of the system, and most particularly the\ng need to plead most cases out on tile day of arraignment. Moreover, it is equally clear that\nthe \"gaps\" in representation that result from the Quitman defense system, including the\nl\ntotal absence of counsel between Justice and Circuit Court (and thus the lack of any\nI investigation or preparation) flow from a structural, systemic flaw in the county-based\nsystem and that simply would not occur in a more rational full-time defender system.\nI\nII. TIlE CIRCUIT COURT AND THE STATE IGNORE THE EXPERT\nTESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE THAT THE COUNTY-BASED SYSTEM\nI\nIN MISSISSIPPI IS CONSTITUTIONALLY FLAWED.\nA. Quitman's Expert Testimony Was Undisputed.\nI\nIt was not only the substantial evidence from Quitman Cotlnly public defenders\nI and other State witnesses that should have resulted in a decision For Quitman County. In\nI\n-11-\n\nI\nI\nI addition, Quitman presented extensive expert evidence and testimony that received little\nor no credit by the Circuit Court, even though it was unrebutted by any expert testimony\nI\nor evidence from the State.\nI These expert and lay witnesses, including Hinds County public defender Thonlas\nFortner, nationally-known indigent defense expert Stephen Bright, noted Mississippi\nI\ndefense counsel Steven Farese, and Mississippi Office of Capital Defense Counsel\nI\nDirector Andre DeGruy, all testified to the problems inherent in and rampant throughout\nthe Mississippi part-time public defender system. Moreover, the Circuit Court wholly\nI\nignored evidence in the record fiom the Spangenberg study, \"'a comprehensive expert\nI\nstudy of indigent defense provision in Mississippi,\" as well as studies conducted or\ncollected by variot,s entities within Mississippi, such as the Public Defender Comnaission,\nI\nthe Public Defender Task Force and its survey of Circuit Court Judge.s, and the Study\n|\nCommission on the Mississippi Judicial System. See Appellants' Br. at 12, 13, 23.\nI All of this expert testimony and evidence was admitted but not given proper\nweight. This was both clear error and an abuse of the Circuit Court's discretion. See\na\nLucedale Veneer Co. v. Rogers, 53 So.2d 69, 75 (Miss. 1951) (\"[E]vidence which is not\nI contradicted by positive testimony or circumstances and is not inherently improbable,\nincredible, or unreasonable, cannot be arbitrarily or capriciously discredited, disregarded,\nI\nor rejected.\"); Tarver 1,.Lindsev, 137 So. 93, 93 (Miss. 1931); Holmes v. Holmes, 123 So.\n!\n865 (Miss. 1929.)\nFor exa,nple, expert Thomas Fortner provided unrebutted testimony that tim\nI\ncounty-based part-time public defender system in Mississippi encourages\nI\n• \"spending the least amou,at of time possible on a case\";\nI\n-12-\n\ni\nI\n• \"disposing of these cases quickly as possible so that you can...\nI\ngo to other counties you serve and do tile same thing there and\nstill have time to engage ill your private practice\"; and\nI\n• \"disposing of[cases] quickly, without proper investigation,\nwithout looking into all the various motions that might be filed,\nto make the best deal you can as fast as you can and take care of\nI\ntile case and be done with it.\"\nTr. 345, 52-53.\nI\nIndeed, Mr. DeGruy, an experienced capital defense counse_ who has seen trials\nI\naround Mississippi, testi fled thai he had seen the same lack of vigorous defense endemic\nto Quitman as set lbrth above, in counties throughout the state including a lack of\nI\ninvestigation, use of expert witnesses, motion practice or effective plea or sentencing\nI\nnegotiations. RE 4 (Tr. 587-90). And unlike the judges whose testimony was credited as\nI if they were qualified as experts in indigent defense, Messrs. DeGruy and Fortner are\nhighly trained and qualified Mississippi defense counsel who have direct experience\nI\nobserving and evaluating the out-of-court conduct and preparation by part-time public\nl defenders in Mississippi.\nSimilarly, the Spangenberg Group, who published a study of indigent defense in\nI\nMississippi under tim auspices of the Mississippi Bar that was received into evidence but\nI\nthen ignored by the Circuit Court, concluded thal lhe same system in Quitman Cotmty\nexisted throughout the state:\nI\nResources are not sufficient to provide adequate representation even\nin felony cases, particularly in Ihose counties using the contract\nI public defender system. Every aspect of defense representation is\ncompromised.\nI RE 15 at MS 03868-69.\nIn particular, tile Spangenberg study identified problems throughout tim public\n!\ndefense system in Mississippi that are identical to those in Quitman Cot,nty:\nI\n-13-\n\nI\nI\n[T]here is very little early representation provided, investigation\nI\nconducted, attorney/client contact, or use of experts. There is a low\ntrial rate in felony and misdemeanor cases. The reqt, irement for\ncontract defenders and assigned counsel to handle their own\nI\nappeals, often with no additional compensation, creates a\ndisincentive for taking cases to trial. Case preparation is often late,\nand frequently preliminary hearings are waived.\nI\nId. Indeed, for each of these flaws identified by the Spangenberg Group as existing\nI\nthroughot,t Mississippi, Quitman introduced evidence at trial to prove proceedings in its\ncourts are no different. 5'ee, e.g.. Tr. at 475,508-509, Tr. 591, Tr. 339, Tr. 876, Tr. 559-\nI\n560, Tr. 352 760-61, RE 16 Tr. 341.\nI\nSimilarly, the Circuit Court gave inadequate consideration tile expert testimony of\nnoted defense experts Steve Bright and Steven Farese. Mr. Farese, based upon his study\nI\nof the system and representation of indigent defendants in counties around the slate, found\nI\nthat the system was \"broken,\" \"made to fail,\" and in some regards a \"shock [to] our legal\nI conscience.\" RE 17 (Tr. 647-48,697). He concluded that the part-time public defender\nsystem with its built-in disincentives and lack of defense counsel independence is\nI\nimbalanced and unlikely to yield \"justice as the final product.\" RE 17 (Tr. 648-49). And\nI Mr. Bright, who has studied indigent defense systems and structures around the United\nStates, concluded that the best the Mississippi system could offer was \"superficial\nI\nprocessing\" of defendants with \"no\" real provision of a vigorous criminal defense. RE 18\nI\n(Tr. 760-61). These experts also concluded that the only way to resolve these problems is\nfor the state to establish a statewide system of indigent defense. See Appellants'Br. at\nI\n45.9\nI\n') Mr. Farese testi fled thal a statewide system would give balance to all otherv¢ise\nI unbalanced system. RE 17 (Tr. 648-49). While Mr. Fortner insisted lha! a system such as\nQuitmart's encourages the type of practices brought to light during trial and lVlS part-time\nI [Footnote is continued on next page]\n-14-\n\nI\nI\nB. Tile Court's Error in Ignoring Unrebutted Expert Testimony Was\nI Compounded by Crediting the Testimony of Local Judges.\nWhile the Circuit Court's refusal to properly credit Quitman County's extensive\nI\nexpert testimony already was error, that error was seriously compounded when the court\nI chose to give substantial weight to the subjective opinions and observations of the local\ncircuit judges, whom it previously had held would not be allowed to testi fy as experts m\nI\nindigent defense. The State relies heavily in its appeal brief on this judicial testimony as a\nI\nbasis for upholding the decision on appeal. And yet as set forth in Quitman's opening\nbrief and herein, reliance on that testimony as to the competence of the public defenders\nI\nwas error for several reasons. First, to pennit testimony at all over the objections of the\nI\nCounty put both the Circuit Court Judges and the defenders who testified in an\nirreconcilable double bind - where an admission of constitutional error by either group of\nI\nparticipants could result in serious professional consequences. This testimony simply\nI\nshould not have been permitted. Second, the Circuit Court continually allowed testimony\nI from the judges that went to an ultimate issue in the case, and that was not proper\ntestimony from a non-expert witness, such as that the defenders were \"competent\" and\nI\n\"effective advocates. '\"° But finally, and perhaps most importantly, this testimony simply\nI\n[Footnote continued from previous page]\nI defense systeln will always be inadequate, while a statewide system would solve these\nproblems (Tr. 358-59), RE 16. Mr. Bright cited such \"bizarre\" practices as using the\nsheriffto find witnesses for cases as evidence of a system that is far too cozy and\nI\ninterdependent to ensure responsibility to the system and not only superficial processing.\nht. He also provided as evidence several states thatlhave implemented statewide systems\nthat solve many of the same problems faced by counties in Mississippi. RE 18 (Tr. 827-\nI\n28).\n10The admission of and reliance upon what at best could be lay opinion evidence was\nI even more striking in light of the manner in which the Court hamstnmg the testimony of\nQuilman's experts to prevent them from opining whether the county-based system is\n[Footnote is continued on next page]\nI\n-15-\n\nI\nI\nI was not probative on the critical issue before tile court - whether the defenders were\nproviding the \"'tools\" of an effective indigent defense.\nI\nIndeed, Circuit Judge Smith admitted that \"a very large part\" of a criminal defense\nI counsel's work is done out of court and he has no personal knowledge of this vital work.\nRE 6 (Tr. 728-38). Similarly, Judge Lewis testified that he has no personal knowledge\nI\nwhether the public defenders investigate their cases, attempt to negotiate pleas or\nI\ncommunicate with clients prior to entering a plea or going to trial. Tr. 918-19. As a\nresult, the Circuit Court's reliance on this evidence for a finding of effectiveness was both\nI\nlegal en'or and an abuse of the trial court's discretion.\nI\nIll. THE CIRCUIT COURT AND MISSISSIPPI ERR IN CONCLUDING THAT\nQUITMAN COUNTY IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING FOR AN\nI ADEQUATE INDIGENT DEFENSE.\nA. Mississippi and the Trial Court's lnsislenee Upon Quitman's Lack\nof Poverty Belies ille Undisputed Record.\nI\nQuitman is poor. That seems an obvious observation. And yet both the Circuit\nI\nCourt and the State go to great lengths to try to demonstrate thai Quitman is either just not\nI poor enough, or perhaps just making bad choices with taxpayer money. While the\nexercise seems almost absurd, the Circuit Court and State seem to believe that Quilman\nI\nCounty should be required to demonstrate that every dollar allocated to such needed\nI sen'ices like Meals on Wheels and the small public library is money taken from indigent\ndefense. But this was simply not the task set out by this court in Quitman v. State, 807\nI\n[Footnole continued from previous page]\nI\nproviding an adeqvate or effective indigent defense. ,See Appellant's Br. at 31-33. It was\nclear error for the court to allow that evidence in but then preclude cxperls Farese and\nFortner to from utilizing their extensive lalowledge and expertise to provide expert\nI\ntestimony on directly relevant matters at issue. See Appellant's Br. at 31-37.\nI\n-16-\n\nI\nI\nI So.2d at 408. Rather, the question tbis Court asked was whether if the current system of\nindigent defense is not adequate, can Quitman County or counties like it pay the much\nI\nhigher costs of providing constitutionally adequate indigent defense? Oil this question, the\nI\nanswer is a resounding no. See. e.g., RE 3 (Tr. Ct. Op. ']]]r41-42) (unrebutted expert\ntestimony that standalone county system provide adequate tools would cost 10-15 times\nI\nmore than Quitm_,n pays now). Simply stated, Quitman is a county that survives on a\nI\nrevolving credit line. Like many poor Mississippi counties, Quitman has a low per capita\nincome, high unemployment and a high demand for public services. These characteristics\nI\nwere detailed extensively by Quitman's county executives at trial below.\nI\nThe evidence showed that Quitman County cannot raise taxes to pay for existing or\nI new programs. Tr. 147-51. The evidence also showed that Quitman already has an\naccumulated deficit- due in large part to federal and state mandates-of more than $2\nI\nmillion in opcrating losses and operating debt (approximately $2,000 per taxpayer) (Tr.\nI 152-53, 159-61, PX 22-24) that precludes thecotmty from starting new programs or\nexpanding existing ones. Tr. 153. Further, the evidence showed that Quitman cannot\nI\nchange its priorities by cutting expenditures to start new programs or expand existing ones\nI\nsuch as indigent defense, since services are already below a bare bones level. Tr. 145-46.\nIndeed, Quitman's financial crisis has forced it to slash the modest amounts it provides the\nI\nlocal hospital and Health Department for health care for the poor by $42,000, a 25% cut,\nI\nand make other major cuts. Tr. 162. And, contrary to the State's suggestion that the\ncounty has substantial discretionary ftmds, 80-85% of its expenditures are mandated by\nI\nthe state and federal governments, Tr. 163, and much of the rest is effectively mandated\nI\nI\n-17-\n\nI\nI\nI by state and federal requirements that the county match contributions in order to\nparticipate in their programs. Tr. 163-65, 171-72.\nI\nIn short, the State's argument that the county could fund an adequate indigent\nI\ndefense ifonlyit eliminated its minimal contributions to keeping alive programs\ndesperately needed by poor children and senior citizens is contrary to the evidence at trial\nI\nand legally irrelevant vnder this Court's Quitman decision.\nI\nrv. MISSISSIPPI SIMPLY IGNORES ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS IN\nFAVOR OF STATEWIDE PUBLIC DEFENDER SYSTEM EFFORT\nTO DEFEND THIS CASE.\nI\nMississippi, like any defendant, surely has its right to an adequate defense. And\nI\nyet the State, who represents all of its citizens, goes to extraordinary length to avoid the\ncritical judicial, legal, and constitutional questions at the heart of this case. Those\nI\nquestions are few, and have been wrestled with by this Court for decades. Is Mississippi\nI\nproviding constitutionally effective defense for its indigent defendants? Is the current,\nI hodgepodge and patchwork system inherently flawed, broken, and imbalanced such that\nthe integrity of the system has been put at risk'? And is the system so in danger that only a\nI\nstatewide state-funded system can fix these fimdamental flaws?\nI The answer to these questions is clear from the trial court record belov,,.\nMississippi counties simply cannot provide indigent defendants with constitutionally\nI\neffective defense, and the current strttcture of the system renders such effective\nI\nrepresentation a practical impossibility.ll Moreover, in light of the abject failure of\nI\nz_Indeed, Mississippi's only purported solution to the problem, to provide some lirnited\nfunding for capital defeqse, was firmly and soundly rejected at trial by the very director of\nI the Office of Capital Defense, Andre DeGruy.

Moreover, this funding\noccurred after Quitman filed suit, was underfunded, and was wholly inadcquate tosolve\n[Footnote iscontinued on next page]\nI\n-18-\n\nI\nI\nI Mississippi in its forty year \"experiment\" requiring counties to supply such defense,\nhistory shows that only one solution is possible - that tile State take over the funding of\nI\nindigent defense. Since this case was filed five years ago, neither the Mississippi Attorney\nI General's Office nor the State Legislature has made a positive step towards advocating\nstatewide funding for the funding of noncapital indigent defense. The defense system\nI\ncontinues to languish, despite ample evidence from constituencies around the State --\nI many of whom have filed amici briefs in the case-- that it is simply too broken to fix. 12\nMississippi fails even to address in their brief the irtherent right of the judiciary to protect\nI\nits own integrity, but that is a right well-recognized at law. 13 This Court should not\nI\nhesitate where others fear to tread, and should order a state-funded system forthwith.\nI\nI\nI\n[Footnote continued fi'om previous page]\nthe ctu-onic underfunding of the system as a whole.

      "text": "807 So.2d 401 (2001)\nSTATE of Mississippi, Ronnie Musgrove, In his Official Capacity as Governor, and Mike\nMoore, In his Official Capacity as Attorney General\nv.\nQUITMAN COUNTY, Mississippi.\nNo. 2000-IA-01477-SCT.\nSupreme Court of Mississippi.\nOctober 31, 2001.\nRehearing Denied February 21, 2002.\n402 *402 Office of the Attorney General, by Roger Googe, Jr., Harold Edward Pizzetta, III, Jackson, Attorneys for\nAppellants.\nRobert B. McDuff, Dennis C. Sweet, III, Jackson, Attorneys for Appellee.\nEN BANC.\nSMITH, J., for the court.\n¶ 1. Quitman County (\"the County\") brought this civil action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Quitman\nCounty Circuit Court against the State of Mississippi, Governor Ronnie Musgrove, and Attorney General Mike\nMoore (\"the State\"). The County alleged that by imposing the obligation to fund the representation of indigent\ncriminal defendants on the County, the State breached its duties under Art. 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution\nto provide adequate representation for indigent criminal defendants and that the State had breached its duties\nunder the Public Defender System Act of 1998 to provide a statewide, state-funded public defender system.\nPursuant to M.R.A.P. 5, this Court granted the State permission to take this interlocutory appeal from an order of\nthe circuit court denying the State's motion to dismiss Count I of the County's complaint for failure to state a claim\n[1]\nupon which relief can be granted.\n403 FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n*403\n¶ 2. The Legislature of this State has adopted a \"county-based system\" of providing indigent defense services. \nSee Miss.Code Ann. § 25-32-7 (1999), § 99-15-17 (2000). Under this system, Quitman County, through its Board\nof Supervisors, has the sole responsibility to provide indigent criminal defense services in that county. At the time\nthis action was filed, Quitman County was responsible for funding indigent defense services in all criminal cases.\nEffective July 1, 2000, the Legislature enacted statutes establishing the Office of Capital Post Conviction\nCounsel, the Office of Capital Defense Counsel, and the Mississippi Public Defender System Task Force. See\nMiss.Code Ann. § 99-39-101 (2000), § 99-18-1 (2000), § 25-32-71 (2000), respectively. After the establishment of\nthese offices, the counties retain responsibility of providing indigent defense services in all non-capital cases.\n¶ 3. In Count I of its complaint, filed December 17, 1999, the County alleged that by imposing the obligation to\nfund indigent defense on the counties, the State breached its duty under Art. 3, § 26 of the Mississippi\nConstitution to provide adequate representation for indigent criminal defendants. In Count II of the complaint, the\nCounty alleged that the State breached its duties under the Mississippi Statewide Public Defender System Act of\n1998 to provide a statewide, state-funded public defender system. The County requested that the circuit court\nenter a declaratory judgment that the State had breached its duties under Art. 3, § 26 of the Mississippi\nConstitution; that the State had breached its duties under the Public Defender System Act of 1998; and that\nMiss.Code Ann. § 25-32-7 and § 99-15-17 are void because they unconstitutionally impose obligations on\ncounties to pay for indigent defense. The County also requested that the circuit court issue an injunction directing\nthe State to provide a statewide, state-funded system of indigent defense. Finally, the County requested that if\n\nthe State failed to provide such a system within a reasonable period of time, the court prohibit the State from\nproviding funds to district attorneys or law enforcement officials for the prosecution of criminal defendants.\n¶ 4. In its answer, the State raised, among other defenses, the affirmative defense of the County's alleged failure\nto state claim on which relief may be granted. The parties began extensive discovery, and on July 10, 2000, the\nState filed its motion to dismiss both causes of action raised by the County. The State argued that Count I of the\ncomplaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and that Count II of\nthe complaint should be dismissed as moot. The State also argued that the County lacked standing to assert\neither cause of action.\n¶ 5. On August 31, 2000, the circuit court entered judgment on the State's motion. The court first concluded that\nthe County had standing to sue, finding that the County has a colorable interest in the State's meeting its\nconstitutional obligations and that the County had experienced adverse effects from the State's alleged failure to\nmeet its constitutional obligations. The court rejected the State's assertion that Count I of the complaint failed to\n404 state a claim upon which relief could be granted. In its opinion, the circuit court stated that *404 though this Court\nhas expressed reluctance to intervene in the State's compliance with Art. 3, § 26, this Court has found that the\nCourts and the Legislature have concurrent responsibility for the State's compliance in this area. The circuit court\nfound that the Courts of this State have the authority to order the Legislature to provide a public defender system\nthat complies with Art. 3, § 26, and concluded that the County may be able to show facts to overcome the\npresumption of the constitutional validity of the State's current public defender system.\n¶ 6. The circuit court granted the State's motion to dismiss as moot Count II of the County's complaint because\nthe Mississippi Statewide Public Defender System Act of 1998 never became effective. Section 21 of the\nMississippi Public Defender System Act stated that \"all new programs authorized under [the act] shall be subject\nto the availability of funds specifically appropriated therefor by the Legislature during the 1998 Regular Session or\nany subsequent session. This act shall be codified, but no amendment to a code section or a repeal of a code\nsection enacted by [the act] shall take effect until the Legislature has funded any new programs authorized\nhereunder....\" The Legislature never provided funding for the Act, and the Act, by its own terms, never became\neffective.\n¶ 7. The State sought to appeal the circuit court's denial of its motion to dismiss Count I of the County's\ncomplaint, and this Court granted the State's petition for interlocutory appeal on October 10, 2000. The County\nconcedes in its brief that the circuit court's dismissal of Count II is not before this Court on appeal.\n¶ 8. The issues raised before this Court on appeal are as follows:\nI. WHETHER THE COUNTY HAS STANDING TO SUE THE STATE REGARDING AN\nINEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL CLAIM ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS\nTAXPAYERS?\nII. WHETHER THE COUNTY'S COMPLAINT FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM UPON WHICH RELIEF\nMAY BE GRANTED.\nDISCUSSION\nI. WHETHER THE COUNTY HAS STANDING TO SUE THE STATE\nREGARDING AN INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL CLAIM ON\nBEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS TAXPAYERS?\n¶ 9. This Court must first address the threshold issue of standing. Quitman County brought this action in its own\nname and on behalf of its taxpayers. The cause of action at issue is premised upon the claim that the State has\nbreached its constitutional duty to provide effective assistance of counsel to Mississippi's indigent criminal\ndefendants.\n\n¶ 10. The State asserts that Quitman County does not have standing to sue because it is suing on its own behalf\nupon an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and that \"[n]o court ... has ever held that the Sixth Amendment\nprotects the rights of anyone other than criminal defendants.\" Portman v. County of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898,\n902 (9th Cir.1993). Accord, Kinoy v. Mitchell, 851 F.2d 591, 594 (2d Cir.1988) (holding that the right to counsel\ncreates no rights for the attorney or anyone other than the defendant). Therefore, since Quitman County's\ncomplaint named the county board members and the taxpayers only and did not name any person who\nspecifically had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel, the State claims that Quitman County does\nnot have standing to sue.\n405 *405 ¶ 11. It is well settled that \"Mississippi's standing requirements are quite liberal.\" Dunn v. Miss. State Dep't\nof Health, 708 So.2d 67, 70 (Miss.1998); see also Miss. Gaming Comm'n v. Bd. of Educ., 691 So.2d 452-460\n(Miss.1997). This Court has explained that while federal courts adhere to a stringent definition of standing, limited\nby Art. 3, § 2 of the United States Constitution to a review of actual cases and controversies, the Mississippi\nConstitution contains no such restrictive language. Van Slyke v. Bd. of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher\nLearning, 613 So.2d 872, 880 (Miss.1993) (citing Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 397-403, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42\nL.Ed.2d 532 (1975)). Therefore, this Court has been \"more permissive in granting standing to parties who seek\nreview of governmental actions.\" Van Slyke, 613 So.2d at 875. See also Dye v. State ex rel. Hale, 507 So.2d 332,\n338 (Miss.1987) (holding state senators had standing to sue Lieutenant Governor on charges that their legislative\npower had been impinged by his power). In Mississippi, parties have standing to sue \"when they assert a\ncolorable interest in the subject matter of the litigation or experience an adverse effect from the conduct of the\ndefendant, or as otherwise provided by law.\" Fordice v. Bryan, 651 So.2d 998, 1003 (Miss.1995); State ex rel.\nMoore v. Molpus, 578 So.2d 624, 632 (Miss.1991).\n¶ 12. Heretofore counties have been permitted to maintain actions against the State to obtain declaratory and\ninjunctive relief against unconstitutional statutes or actions by the state. See, e.g., State v. Miss. Ass'n of\nSupervisors, Inc., 699 So.2d 1221 (Miss.1997) (Association of Supervisors and counties brought action seeking\ndeclaration of unconstitutionality of statutes allowing operators of certain vehicles to apply to Mississippi\nDepartment of Transportation rather than counties for permit to operate on non-federal highways); State v. Hinds\nCounty Bd. of Supervisors, 635 So.2d 839, 842 (Miss.1994) (county brought action seeking declaration of\nunconstitutionality of statute setting reimbursement to county for housing of state inmates in county jail). A county\nmay sue and be sued pursuant to Miss.Code Ann. § 11-45-17 (1972). Also, a suit may be brought \"in the name of\na county, where only part of the county or its inhabitants are concerned, and where there is a public right to be\nvindicated.\" Miss.Code Ann. § 11-45-19 (1972). See also Bd. of Trustees v. Van Slyke, 510 So.2d 490, 496 (Miss.\n1987) (where standing by individuals and boards is also permitted in Mississippi in any \"action ... concerning a\nmatter of general public interest....\").\n¶ 13. Here, the question at hand is whether Quitman County has asserted a colorable interest in the subject\nmatter of the litigation or experienced an adverse effect from the conduct of the defendant. Clearly, Quitman\nCounty has asserted a colorable interest in the existing county-based system of indigent defense funding.\nQuitman County complains that the county-based system results in an inadequate and unconstitutional system of\nindigent defense. Quitman County is particularly interested in this funding scheme because it, obviously, is a\ncounty, and, as such, is the entity which our Legislature has required to provide indigent defense funding.\nFurthermore, Quitman County has experienced an adverse effect from the State's alleged failure to provide\nadequate funding for indigent defendants. Quitman County asserts that the county-based system has had\ndevastating consequences for the county's budget, for the taxpayers, for the criminal justice system, and for the\nindigent defendants. For these reasons, Quitman County has standing to bring this action against the State.\n406  II. WHETHER THE COUNTY'S COMPLAINT FAILED TO STATE A\n*406\nCLAIM UPON WHICH RELIEF MAY BE GRANTED.\n¶ 14. The second issue before this Court is whether the circuit court erred in finding that the County stated in\nCount I of its complaint a claim upon which relief may be granted. We stress that the sole question before us is\nwhether the County can prove no set of facts which would entitle it to the relief requested. Our analysis of this\n\nissue requires no conclusion as to the constitutional validity of the funding scheme enacted by the Legislature.\nThough members of this Court have heretofore expressed dissatisfaction with that scheme and even gone so far\nas to question its constitutional validity, that question is not presently before us, and this opinion should not be\nconstrued as stating a position on that issue.\n¶ 15. Again, the County alleged in its complaint that by requiring counties to fund the representation of indigent\ndefendants, the State has violated its duty under Art. 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution to provide effective\nassistance of counsel to indigent criminal defendants. The County claims that Miss.Code Ann. § 25-32-7 and §\n99-15-17 are unconstitutional because they impose fiscal obligations to provide defense counsel on the counties\nin violation of the State's duty under Art. 3, § 26. In its opinion, the circuit court repeatedly refers to the State's\ncompliance with the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Art. 3, § 26 of the Mississippi\nConstitution. The County's complaint, however, brings this action only under Art. 3, § 26 of the Mississippi\nConstitution.\n¶ 16. A motion to dismiss under M.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) raises an issue of law, which is reviewed de novo. Lowe v.\nLowndes County Bldg. Inspection Dep't, 760 So.2d 711, 712 (Miss.2000); Tucker v. Hinds County, 558 So.2d\n869, 872 (Miss. 1990). Taking the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint as true, the motion should not\nbe granted unless it appears beyond any reasonable doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of\nits claim which would entitle it to relief. Moore ex rel. City of Aberdeen v. Byars, 757 So.2d 243, 246 (Miss.2000).\n¶ 17. Essentially, the State makes two arguments regarding the County's alleged failure to state a claim. First, the\nState argues that the County's allegations, even if taken as true, are insufficient to overcome the applicable\npresumption of constitutionality afforded the statutes at issue. Second, the State argues that the financing of\npublic defenders is a legislative matter for which the courts can provide no remedy. We will address these\narguments in turn. It is well settled that a court may strike down an act of the legislature \"only where it appears\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\" that the statute violates the clear language of the constitution. James v. State, 731\nSo.2d 1135, 1136 (Miss. 1999). A party challenging the statute must be able to \"overcome the strong\npresumption\" that the act is constitutional. Cities of Oxford, Carthage, Starkville, & Tupelo v. Northeast Elec.\nPower Ass'n, 704 So.2d 59, 65 (Miss.1997).\n¶ 18. Art. 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution states, in pertinent part:\nIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself or counsel, or\nboth, to demand the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted by the witnesses\nagainst him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and, in all\n407 prosecutions by indictment or information, a speedy and public trial by an *407 impartial jury of the\ncounty where the offense was committed....\nThis provision has been interpreted to create a duty on the part of the State to provide effective assistance of\ncounsel to indigent defendants. Mease v. State, 583 So.2d 1283 (Miss.1991); Wilson v. State, 574 So.2d 1338\n(Miss.1990); Conn v. State, 251 Miss. 488, 170 So.2d 20 (1964) (relying on Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335,\n83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963)).\n¶ 19. The State legislatively requires counties to fund the representation of indigent criminal defendants. Section\n25-32-7 provides:\nThe public defender shall be provided with office space, secretarial assistance, and all reasonable\nexpenses of operating the office, at least equal to or more than the county prosecuting attorney, or\nthe district attorney if the public defender represents the entire circuit court district. The\ncompensation and expenses of the public defender's office shall be paid by the county or counties\nif two (2) or more counties are acting jointly. The funds shall be paid upon allowance by the board\nof supervisors by order spread upon the minutes of the board.\n¶ 20. Also, § 99-15-17 provides, in pertinent part, \"The fees and expenses [of counsel for indigents] as allowed by\nthe appropriate judge shall be paid by the county treasurer out of the general fund of the county in which the\nprosecution was commenced.\"\n\n¶ 21. The cases brought before this Court to date involved the issue of the State's compliance with its duty to\nprovide representation for indigent criminal defendants in the context of the limits placed on attorney's fees in\nindividual cases by § 99-15-17. In each of those cases, the Court upheld the constitutional validity of § 99-15-17,\ndeferring to the Legislature's right to expend public funds. See Mease v. State, 583 So.2d 1283 (Miss.1991); \nWilson v. State, 574 So.2d 1338 (Miss.1990); Pruett v. State, 574 So.2d 1342 (Miss.1990). The case at hand is\ndifferent in that it involves the issue of the State's compliance with its duty to provide representation for indigent\ncriminal defendants in the context of a system of providing indigent defense. Nevertheless, in two of those cases,\nmembers of the Court expressed reservations regarding the constitutional validity of the county-based system of\nindigent representation. In Wilson this Court stated:\nNothing in this opinion is meant to interfere with the right of the Legislature to order the\nexpenditure of public funds but in light of this opinion, the Legislature may wish to reconsider the\nfunding of attorney representation of indigents. In fact, we would encourage the Legislature to\nreview the system and provide funds for the representation of indigent defendants in capital cases\nfrom State funds rather than county funds. Since the State funds the prosecution in these cases,\nwhy not the defense?\nWilson, 574 So.2d at 1341. Also, in Mease, Justice Prather, specially concurring, stated, \"As in Wilson, I suggest\nthe Legislature address the problem of indigent representation on a statewide basis, rather than thrust the burden\non financially-strapped counties.\" Mease, 583 So.2d at 1285.\n¶ 22. The County alleges that § 99-15-17 and § 25-32-7 unconstitutionally remove the burden of the State to\nprovide representation for indigent defendants and place it on the County. The County does not argue that it is\nper se unconstitutional for the Legislature to require the County to fund the representation of indigent defendants.\nIn fact, the County conceded during oral argument that the Legislature has the authority to place the burden of\n408 such funding on the *408 County. The County's argument lies in the allegation that these statutes do not meet the\nrequirements of Art. 3, § 26 because they result, in Quitman County, in widespread ineffective assistance of\ncounsel due to the fact that the County cannot afford to discharge its burden of providing funding for indigent\ndefendants in a constitutional manner. The State argues that because the Legislature has the authority to direct\ncounties, as subdivisions and agencies of the State, to assist in providing representation for indigent defendants,\nthe County's complaint fails to allege a palpable conflict between the actions of the Legislature and the\nConstitution and, as such, must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n¶ 23. The State relies on Art. 14, § 261, which provides that \"[t]he expenses of criminal prosecutions shall be\nborne by the county in which such prosecution shall be begun....\" The State's reliance on Art. 14, § 261 is\nmisplaced. Again, the County's allegations do not rest on the assertion that the State is constitutionally prohibited\nfrom requiring the County to provide funding for indigent defense. Rather, the County's allegations rest on the\nassertion that the State's requiring the County to provide funding has resulted in chronic underfunding and\nsystemic ineffective assistance of counsel in Quitman County. It is not the funding which the County argues the\nState has unconstitutionally shifted to the counties, but the ultimate obligation of indigent defense. The breach of\nduty, alleges the County, occurred not when the State required the counties to fund indigent criminal defenses,\nbut when that requirement resulted in systemic ineffective assistance of counsel that has gone unchecked and\nunremedied by the State. It is the State's failure to remedy the alleged systemic ineffective assistance of counsel\nthat is the crux of the County's complaint.\n¶ 24. The County states that at trial it is prepared to show the cost of an effective system of indigent criminal\ndefense, the County's inability to fund such a system, and the failure of the existing system to provide indigent\ndefendants in Quitman County with the tools of an adequate defense. The County's complaint includes the\nfollowing well-pled facts:\n00 The State's refusal to provide funds and its imposition of the financial burden on resource-\n95\nstarved counties has had dire consequences for the provision of indigent defense services in\nMississippi. Studies prepared for a committee of the Mississippi Bar Association in the 1990s\nfound:\n\n00Funding for indigent defense is totally inadequate (amounting to $3.24 per capita, far less than\n97\nany other state);\n00The lack of adequate resources for indigent defense services results in poor quality services and\n97\nrepresentation that falls beneath the minimum standards of representation required by the\nMississippi Constitution; and\n00There is not statewide oversight of indigent defense, which leads to a hodgepodge, county-by-\n97\ncounty approach to defense services.\n00 The State's lack of involvement in the provision of indigent defense and inadequate resources\n95\navailable to such indigent defense means that constitutional requirements for the effective\nassistance of counsel are not met. Studies conducted for the Mississippi Bar Associate found:\nResources are not sufficient to provide adequate representation even in felony cases, particularly\nin those counties using the contract public defender system. Every aspect of defense\n409 representation is compromised. *409 Specifically, there is very little: early representation provided,\ninvestigation conducted, attorney/client contact, or use of experts. There is a low trial rate in felony\nand misdemeanor cases. The requirement for contract defenders and assigned counsel to handle\ntheir own appeals, often with no additional compensation, creates a disincentive for taking cases\nto trial. Case preparation is often late, and frequently preliminary hearings are waived and\ndefendants are held in jail three to six months without counsel until arraignment in circuit court.\nThe overall situation has led to an insufficient number of qualified attorneys willing to take court\nappointments in indigent cases or to seek contract public defender positions.\n00 The defendants have imposed enormous and unpredictable indigent defense costs on Quitman\n95\nCounty and its taxpayers. As a result, financial resources available to fund schools, hospitals, local\nlaw enforcement and the traditional health, safety and welfare obligations of county government\nhave been substantially reduced.\nDefendants' imposition of indigent defense costs on counties has disproportionately increased tax\nburdens on counties with small populations but significant crime problems00often from non-\n97\nresidents00such as Quitman County, and has led to unequal tax burdens.\n97\nChronic underfunding of indigent defense has resulted in constitutional requirements for effective\nassistance of counsel often not being met and has adversely affected the administration of justice\nin Mississippi.\n¶ 25. We conclude that the County has pleaded facts which, when taken as true as they must be on a Rule 12(b)\n(6) motion, are sufficient to demonstrate that by requiring Quitman County to fund indigent criminal defense in\nthat County, the State has breached its constitutional duty to provide indigent defendants with effective\nassistance of counsel.\n¶ 26. Additionally, the State argues that the financing of public defenders is a legislative matter for which the\ncourts can provide no remedy. The State asserts that because there exists no constitutional restriction on the\nability of the State to allocate the costs of indigent defense between the State and counties, the system of\nindigent defense is a public policy decision solely within the purview of the Legislature.\n¶ 27. This Court has recognized that in most instances the authority to control the expenditure of funds for the\npurpose of indigent defense is a legislative rather than a judicial matter. See Wilson v. State, 574 So.2d 1338,\n1340 (Miss.1990); Bd. of Supervisors v. Bailey, 236 So.2d 420, 423 (Miss.1970). Though questions of this nature\nare traditionally legislative affairs, this Court has recognized that where the Legislature fails to act, the courts\nhave the authority and the duty to intervene. This Court addressed the Legislature's failure to allocate sufficient\nfunds for the courts to operate in Hosford v. State, 525 So.2d 789 (Miss.1988). In Hosford, poor courtroom\nconditions including loud noises and poor temperature control led the circuit court to petition this Court for\nassistance so that the county courthouse would have adequate operating facilities. We noted that while the three\n\nbranches of government should remain separate and co-equal, where the Legislature, in its allocation of funds to\nthe judicial branch, \"fails to fulfill a constitutional obligation to enable the judicial branch to operate independently\n410 and effectively, then it has violated its Constitutional mandate, and the Judicial branch has the authority to see \n*410 that courts do not atrophy.\" Id. at 798. The Court recognized that while the Legislature has the authority \"to\nfurnish what funds and facilities it deems proper,\" the courts may act in cases of necessity where the Legislature\nfails to furnish the essentials required for the operation of an independent and effective court. Id. Certainly, if\nadequate facilities are essential to the administration of justice, so is effective representation.\n¶ 28. In Jackson v. State, 732 So.2d 187, 190 (Miss.1999), this Court recognized its authority to act in cases of\nnecessity. In Jackson, this Court held that the indigent petitioner was entitled to appointed and compensated\ncounsel to represent him in his post-conviction efforts. We stated, with regard to expenses in post-conviction\nproceedings, \"The Legislature has been aware of this acute problem.... It is strongly urged that the Legislature\nproceed toward a solution to this serious problem by enacting the program utilized in Virginia or some other\nsystem. We can no longer sit idly by.\" Id. at 191.\n¶ 29. In Wilson v. State, 574 So.2d 1338, 1340 (Miss.1990), the Court addressed the issue of indigent defense\nattorney compensation under § 99-15-17 and stated, \"[w]hile we do have the authority to override the Legislature\nin cases of absolute necessity, we have previously held that the issue of compensation for an attorney appointed\nto defend an accused in a criminal case is a legislative matter rather than a judicial matter.\" See also Bd. of\nSupervisors v. Bailey, 236 So.2d 420 (Miss. 1970) (where the Court first indicated that the question of\ncompensation was a legislative matter as opposed to a judicial matter).\n¶ 30. The question raised by the County's allegations is whether, assuming the State has failed in its duty to\nprovide effective indigent defense, the county-based system has resulted in the inability of the judiciary to operate\nin an independent and effective manner to the extent that this Court must, of necessity, interfere in this\ntraditionally legislative function and order the Legislature to establish a statewide, state-funded system of indigent\ncriminal defense. Again, taking as true the well-pled allegations of the County's complaint, such systemic\nconstitutional deficiencies would entitle the County to relief.\nCONCLUSION\n¶ 31. Quitman County has standing to bring this action against the State. The County has a colorable interest in\nthe State's compliance with its duty to provide effective assistance of counsel to indigent defendants under Art. 3,\n§ 26. Furthermore, the injuries alleged in its complaint by Quitman County to itself and its taxpayers are sufficient\nevidence of an adverse effect from the State's alleged lack of compliance with Art. 3, § 26 to survive a Rule 12(b)\n(6) motion. Whether Quitman County can prove such allegations at a full trial on the merits will be determined\nupon remand.\n¶ 32. The circuit court correctly found that the County stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. Therefore,\nthe order denying the State's motion to dismiss Count I of the Complaint is affirmed, and as such this case is\nremanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.\n¶ 33. AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.\nBANKS and McRAE, P.JJ., COBB and DIAZ, JJ., CONCUR. PITTMAN, C.J., DISSENTS WITH SEPARATE\nWRITTEN OPINION JOINED BY WALLER, J. EASLEY, J., JOINS IN PART. MILLS, J., NOT PARTICIPATING.\n411 *411 PITTMAN, C.J., dissenting.\n¶ 34. This case is before us on interlocutory appeal from the Quitman County Circuit Court. Judge Elzy J. Smith\ngranted the State's M.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Count Two of Quitman County's complaint, but denied\nthe motion with respect to Count One of the complaint. Count One alleges the State has breached its duty under\nArticle 3, Section 26 of the Mississippi Constitution to provide and fund adequate representation for indigent\ncriminal defendants. The County claims this breach is occurring because Miss.Code Ann. § 25-32-7 (1999) and §\n99-15-17 (2000) have shifted the burden of paying for indigent defendant's counsel from the State to the County\nand the County does not adequately pay for counsel. The County asks that these statutes be declared\n\nunconstitutional and that an injunction issue to require the State to provide a statewide public defender system. It\nasserts that this lack of funding for indigent defense counsel is causing systemic ineffective assistance of counsel\nwithin its borders.\n¶ 35. This Court has previously held: \"[I]neffective assistance of counsel is a matter that is better decided on a\ncase by case basis.\" Wilson v. State, 574 So.2d 1338, 1341 (Miss.1990). See also State ex rel. Stephan v. Smith,\n242 Kan. 336, 747 P.2d 816, 831 (1987). There are no other cases where anyone other than the defendant has\nbeen allowed to raise this claim. Portman v. County of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir.1993) (\"No court\n... has ever held that the Sixth Amendment protects the rights of anyone other than criminal defendants.\"). \nAccord, Kinoy v. Mitchell, 851 F.2d 591, 594 (2d Cir.1988).\n¶ 36. Quitman County brings this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on behalf of its taxpayers, not the\nindigent defendants. The County does not propose to prove how its public defenders have been ineffective in\nspecific cases. Rather, the County is concerned with the financial burdens the costs of indigent defense is placing\nupon its tax revenues. To allow Quitman County to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim here would\nunnecessarily broaden jurisprudence on standing and where it leads, this Court cannot now know. Claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel are, of necessity, fact-specific as what constitutes ineffective assistance in one\ncase may not be in another. It would be premature to say that all indigent defendants awaiting trial in Quitman\nCounty have received ineffective assistance of counsel since they have not had an opportunity to have their guilt\ndetermined at trial and their counsel's assistance examined in light of those proceedings.\n¶ 37. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that Quitman County's problems giving indigents effective assistance of\ncounsel were created by its own failure to act. The Quitman County Board of Supervisors is bringing this suit\nbecause it does not believe it pays its own public defenders adequately. To allow the County to have standing\ndue to its partially self-imposed problems would be to open the door to a floodgate of lawsuits on many subject\nmatters where a County Board of Supervisors disagrees with state law. Therefore, I do not agree that the County\nhas standing to raise indigent defendants' claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n¶ 38. The majority also finds Quitman County has stated a claim for which relief may be granted. Quitman County\nasks for the following relief:\n1) declaratory judgment that:\nA) the State has breached its duty to afford indigent defendants effective assistance of counsel,\nB) the statutes placing the funding of indigent defense on the county are null and void,\n412 *412 C) the State is required to establish a statewide, state-funded public defenders office for all\nindigent defendants\n2) preliminary and permanent injunctions that:\nA) direct the State to establish a statewide public defender's office\nB) if no such office is established, then to prohibit the State from funding the prosecution of\ncriminal defendants.\nWhere will the counties and a majority of this Court strike next? State-aid roads, law enforcement, and the like?\nThese requirements are imposed by state statute. Will we next be called on to judicially weigh their desirability or\ntheir proper funding?\n¶ 39. This Court can strike down a statute only where it appears beyond all reasonable doubt the statute violates\nthe clear language of the Constitution. James v. State, 731 So.2d 1135, 1136 (Miss.1999). There is a strong\npresumption a statute is constitutional which the party challenging the statute must overcome. Cities of Oxford,\nCarthage, Starkville & Tupelo v. Northeast Miss. Elec. Power Ass'n., 704 So.2d 59, 65 (Miss.1997). Any doubts\nconcerning the constitutionality of a statute must be resolved in favor of the validity of the statute. Id. It is clear\nthat the statutes placing the burden of funding indigent defense counsel on the counties as arms of the State are\nsupported by Article 14, Section 261 of our Constitution. Section 261 reads: \"The expenses of criminal\n\nprosecution shall be borne by the county in which prosecution shall be begun....\" This Court has held that\ncompensation for public defenders are part of the expenses of a criminal prosecution. Bd. of Supervisors v.\nBailey, 236 So.2d 420 (Miss.1970). As there is no disagreement between the Constitution and the statutes in\nquestion, then there is an absolute presumption for the statutes' validity and no cause to hold the statutes\nunconstitutional.\n¶ 40. This Court has addressed claims similar to the one raised here in Wilson and Pruett v. State, 574 So.2d\n1342 (Miss. 1990) (controlled by Wilson). In Wilson, an indigent defendant raised the issue that his counsel could\nnot render effective assistance to him, or anyone, due to the compensation constraints of Miss.Code Ann. §\n99-15-17, a section which Quitman County seeks to have declared unconstitutional. This Court refused to find\nthis section unconstitutional in light of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but chose to construe it in a\nconstitutional manner which allowed for reimbursement for actual costs of defense. The Court went on further to\nexplain:\nWhile we do have the authority to override the Legislature in cases of absolute necessity, we have\npreviously held that the issue of compensation for an attorney appointed to defend an accused in\na criminal case is a legislative matter rather than a judicial matter.\nAlthough we recognize our inherent authority to provide counsel for indigents, we refused to\ninterfere with the Legislature's right to expend public funds. The Legislature is better equipped to\nhandle this matter....\nWilson, 574 So.2d at 1340. It is clear, then, that the statute in question is constitutional 00and has been held so by\n97\nthis Court00and relief cannot be had in the form of an injunction which strikes it down.\n97\n¶ 41. Article 1, Sections 1 and 2 also indicate that it is outside the Court's power to assume control of the\nestablishment and funding of a public defender's office from the Legislature. Article 1, Section 2 specifically\nprovides:\nNo person or collection of persons, being one or belonging to one of these departments [the three\n413 branches of government], *413 shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the\nothers....\nMiss. Const. art. 1, § 2. In only the rarest of circumstances should this Court interfere in a duty it has held to\nbelong to the Legislature. See Jackson v. State, 732 So.2d 187, 190 (Miss.1999); Wilson, 574 So.2d at 1340; \nHosford v. State, 525 So.2d 789, 797, 798 (Miss.1988); Bailey, 236 So.2d at 422. Quitman County is ultimately\nasking this Court to force the Legislature to create a statewide public defender's office and fund it. I agree that it\nwould be wise for the Legislature to create and fund a statewide public defender's office. However, the\n[2]\nLegislature has attempted to solve the problem of indigent defense in other ways.  By its actions the Legislature\nhas shown that it is not blind to the plight of Quitman County. It is the Legislature which holds the key to solving\nthese problems, not this Court by impressive and excessive exercise of judicial authority. Therefore, I dissent.\nWALLER, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.

Christopher Klotz, William H. Voth, Kathleen A. Behan, attorneys for appellant.\n1034 *1034 Office of the Attorney General by Billy Berryhill, Harold Edward Pizzetta, attorneys for appellees.\nEN BANC.\nSMITH, Chief Justice, for the Court.\n¶ 1. This case is now before this Court a second time. Quitman County [hereinafter the County] filed this action\nfor declaratory and injunctive relief against the State of Mississippi, Governor Haley Barbour, and Attorney\nGeneral Jim Hood. The County alleged that Mississippi's statutes requiring the counties to provide legal services\nfor indigent criminal defendants are unconstitutional. The County sought a declaratory judgment because the\nState has allegedly breached its duty to provide effective assistance of counsel, in violation of Article 3, Section\n26 of the Mississippi Constitution, and the County also sought an injunction to compel the Legislature to create a\nstatewide, state-funded public defenders' office. After the Circuit Court of Quitman County denied the defendants'\nmotion to dismiss, this Court granted permission for an interlocutory appeal. State v. Quitman Cty., 807 So.2d\n401, 402 (Miss. 2001) (Quitman I).\n¶ 2. This Court held that the County had standing to bring this action and had pleaded facts which, if assumed to\nbe true, were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Id. at 406, 409. This Court affirmed and remanded but stressed that its decision \"should not be\nconstrued as stating a position\" on the constitutionality of the current funding scheme or \"[w]hether Quitman\nCounty can prove [its] allegations at a full trial on the merits will be determined upon remand.\" Id. at 406, 410.\nFollowing a trial on remand, the circuit court found no constitutional violation and entered judgment for the\ndefendants. We agree with the learned circuit judge. Quitman County failed to meet its burden of proof. We,\ntherefore, affirm.\nFACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n¶ 3. A bench trial was held in the Circuit Court of Quitman County from April 29, 2003, through May 6, 2003. After\nthe parties had submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court issued a thorough opinion\nconcluding that Quitman County had not met its burden of proving that the funding mechanism established by\nstatute had led to systemic ineffective assistance of counsel in Quitman County and throughout the state. The\ncircuit court's final judgment was entered on November 10, 2003, and Quitman County filed a timely notice of\nappeal.\nApplicable Law\n¶ 4. In Quitman I, 807 So.2d at 410, this Court stated that:\n\n[t]he question raised by the County's allegations is whether, assuming the State has failed in its\nduty to provide effective indigent defense, the county-based system has resulted in the inability of\nthe judiciary to operate in an independent and effective manner to the extent that this Court must\nof necessity, interfere in this traditionally legislative function and order the Legislature to establish\na statewide, state-funded system of indigent criminal defense. Again, taking as true the well-pled\nallegations of the County's complaint, such system constitutional deficiencies would entitle the\nCounty to relief.\nIn Quitman I, 807 So.2d at 406-07, we also recited the applicable law dealing with the representation of indigent\ndefendants and the funding thereof. Art. 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution states, in pertinent part that:\n1035 *1035 In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself or counsel,\nor both, to demand the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted by the witnesses\nagainst him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and, in all\nprosecutions by indictment or information, a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the\ncounty where the offense was committed....\nThis provision has been interpreted to create a duty on the part of the State to provide effective assistance of\ncounsel to indigent defendants. Id. See also Mease v. State, 583 So.2d 1283 (Miss.1991); Wilson v. State, 574\nSo.2d 1338 (Miss.1990); Conn v. State, 251 Miss. 488, 170 So.2d 20 (1964) (relying on Gideon v. Wainwright,\n372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963)). Additionally, Art. 14, § 261 of the Mississippi Constitution\nprovides that \"[t]he expenses of criminal prosecutions shall be borne by the county in which such prosecution\nshall be begun.\"\n¶ 5. Section 25-32-7 of the Mississippi Code Annotated is the statutory authority that requires counties to fund the\nrepresentation of indigent criminal defendants and specifically provides for the compensation and expenses for\nthe public defender's office. Section 25-32-7 provides that:\nThe public defender shall be provided with office space, secretarial assistance, and all reasonable\nexpenses of operating the office, at least equal to or more than the county prosecuting attorney, or\nthe district attorney if the public defender represents the entire circuit court district. The\ncompensation and expenses of the public defender's office shall be paid by the county or counties\nif two (2) or more counties are acting jointly. The funds shall be paid upon allowance by the board\nof supervisors by order spread upon the minutes of the board.\nAlso, § 99-15-17, in pertinent part provides \"[t]he fees and expenses [of counsel for indigents] as allowed by the\nappropriate judge shall be paid by the county treasurer out of the general fund of the county in which the\nprosecution was commenced.\" Quitman I, 807 So.2d at 407.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Applicable Legal Standard.\n¶ 6. This Court has held that if the trial court applies the wrong legal standard, the review of the ruling is de novo. \nBaker v. State, 802 So.2d 77, 80 (Miss. 2001) (citing Butler v. State, 592 So.2d 983, 986 (Miss.1991) (\"[T]he trial\ncourt enjoys considerable discretion, and, so long as that court exercises that discretion by reference to the\ncorrect legal standards, we will not reverse absent substantial abuse of discretion\")). This Court has also stated\n\"where ... the trial judge has applied an erroneous legal standard, we should not hesitate to reverse.\" McClendon\nv. State, 539 So.2d 1375, 1377 (Miss.1989). This Court has held that it \"cannot overturn the decree of a\nchancellor unless it finds with reasonable certainty that the decree is manifestly wrong on a question of law or\ninterpretation of facts pertaining to legal questions.\" Incorporation of the City of Oak Grove v. City of Hattiesburg,\n684 So.2d 1274, 1276 (Miss.1996) (citations omitted). Moreover a \"`circuit judge sitting without a jury is accorded\nthe same deference with regard to his findings as a chancellor,' and his findings are safe on appeal where they\n\nare supported by substantial, credible, and reasonable evidence.\" City of Clinton v. Smith, 861 So.2d 323, 326\n(Miss.2003) (internal citations omitted).\n1036 ¶ 7. At trial, the County had the burden of proving that the State has breached its constitutional duty to provide \n*1036 indigent defendants with effective assistance of counsel by requiring each county to fund its own indigent\ncriminal defense. The County asserted that it cannot afford to discharge its burden of providing funding for\nindigent defendants in a constitutional manner. Since statutes are presumptively constitutional, when there is a\nconflict between a statutory scheme and a constitutional provision, it must be \"palpable\" before the courts of this\nState will declare a statute unconstitutional. State v. Miss. Ass'n of Supervisors, Inc., 699 So.2d 1221, 1223\n(Miss.1997). Therefore, the County had to establish the unconstitutionality of this system beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Jones v. State, 710 So.2d 870, 877 (Miss.1998).\nThe Strickland standard\n¶ 8. The County claims that the circuit judge applied the wrong legal standard to the its claims for relief. The\nCounty argues that instead of using the standard that this Court and the United States Supreme Court held\ngoverns this case, the circuit judge applied a \"higher, two part test used only for post conviction challenges by\nindividual criminal defendants\" as elaborated in Howard v. State, 853 So.2d 781 (Miss.2003) and Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The United States Supreme Court\nheld in Strickland v. Washington 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 that:\nThus, a court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel's\nchallenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel's conduct.\nA convicted defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts or omissions\nof counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment. The\ncourt must then determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or\nomissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. In making that\ndetermination, the court should keep in mind that counsel's function, as elaborated in prevailing\nprofessional norms, is to make the adversarial testing process work in the particular case. At the\nsame time, the court should recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered\nadequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional\njudgment.\nThe State counters this assertion by saying that the circuit court \"unambiguously stated that the question before it\nwas not `whether in isolated cases the public defenders were ineffective.'\" Attorneys David Tisdell and Allan\nShackleford were responsible for all indigent cases in the Circuit Courts of Quitman, Coahoma, and Tunica\nCounties, all appeals in those cases, and for Justice Court indigent representations in Quitman and Tunica.\nTisdell replaced Thomas Pearson, who was formerly a public defender until his termination in 2000.\n¶ 9. Even so, the County maintains that the circuit judge mistakenly proceeded as if the case were an individual\npost-conviction proceeding, in which the County would have had to prove on a case-by-case basis that the\nattorney's performance was deficient and the defendant was prejudiced. The County states that it does \"not seek\nto overturn particular convictions, but rather seeks a system that meets constitutional guarantees.\" In her opinion,\nthe circuit judge stated that \"[w]hen a statute can be interpreted either as constitutional or unconstitutional, the\nSupreme Court has long held that they will adopt the constitutional construction. If possible, they will construe it\n1037 so as `to enable it to *1037 withstand the constitutional attack and to carry out the purpose embedded in the\n[statute].'\" (quoting Wilson v. State, 574 So.2d at 1340). In other words, \"[i]t is not this Court's duty to look for\nfactual possibilities or scenarios that would create conflict with the statute, thereby rendering the statute\nunconstitutional. Rather, this Court's duty is to interpret the Act and envision facts and scenarios in which the\nstatute could be held constitutional.\" State v. Jones, 726 So.2d 572, 573 (Miss. 1998).\n¶ 10. In Quitman I, 807 So.2d at 408, this Court held that the County would be entitled to the prospective\nstatewide relief it seeks if it established the cost of an effective system of indigent criminal defense, the county's\ninability to fund such a system, and the failure of the existing system to provide indigent defendants in Quitman\nCounty with the tools of an adequate defense. The circuit judge ruled that the County failed to establish these\n\nfacts beyond a reasonable doubt. The County asserts that \"[t]he evidence at trial established each of these\nelements.\"\n¶ 11. The State correctly points out that \"[c]ommon sense suggests that if Quitman County claims there is\nwidespread and pervasive ineffectiveness, the most probative evidence to support that claim would be testimony\nabout specific instances when the public defenders' performance fell below `an objective standard of\nreasonableness' as measured by the professional norms.\" (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 688,\n104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674). The State also asserts that the circuit judge expected to hear such testimony\nat trial since the County alleged in its complaint that requiring each county to pay for its own public defenders did\nnot satisfy the constitutional requirements for effective assistance of counsel. The record reflects that no such\nevidence was presented at trial. Likewise, the circuit judge, in her opinion, stated:\nThe County alleged that \"there have been numerous post-conviction challenges to the adequacy\nof counsel provided to indigent defendants tried for felonies in Quitman County.\" However, the\nCounty presented no evidence to the Court of any post-conviction proceedings which challenged\nthe effectiveness of appointed counsel. The County did not present proof from any defendant who\nclaimed to have received ineffective assistance, nor did they identify any single case where\nineffective assistance was alleged. No proof was presented that any case has ever been\noverturned in Quitman County because of ineffective assistance.\nThe County did not present any evidence on any one of the central factual allegations in its complaint, and the\nCounty did not try to show specific examples of when the public defenders' legal representation fell below the\nobjective standard of professional reasonableness.\n¶ 12. The County references the above-cited passage as evidence that the circuit judge \"fundamentally\nmisconceived\" the nature of its case. However, the record does not offer any evidence that the court or the State\nthought that the County was seeking to overturn particular convictions. The circuit judge noted that the evidence\npresented at trial proved that \"Quitman County is a small rural county experiencing a high rate of poverty.\" In her\nopinion, the circuit judge stated that:\nThe evidence shows that Quitman County spends less than 1% of the county budget on indigent\ndefense, $38,352 per year. This expenditure has remained the same since 2000. Testimony\n1038 revealed that the county's deficit was mainly a result of spending in the area *1038 of solid waste,\nother unfunded mandates, natural disasters, and economic development bonds that were not\nbeing repaid. While the County established that it is struggling to meet its financial obligations and\nhas had to cut funding in some areas, there was no testimony that resources to fund schools,\nhospitals, and local law enforcement were reduced because of indigent defense costs as was\nalleged in the Complaint. The Court is convinced that indigent defense is neither the cause not the\nsolution to the county's financial difficulties.\nEssential tools of defense\n¶ 13. In addition to claiming that the circuit judge applied the wrong legal standard, the County also maintains that\neven under the Strickland analysis, it did show that the essential tools of defense were not provided. The County\nclaims that, like this Court in the case at bar, other courts have concluded that prospective challenges to indigent\ndefense systems were not subject to the requirements of Strickland, and that the proper inquiry is whether the\nsystem provides the tools of an adequate defense. The County further explains that there were distinct\ndifferences between the applicable standards to post-conviction proceedings and to systemic challenges. In a\npost-conviction challenges, the County avers that \"courts attempt to balance the individual defendant's interest in\nchallenging his conviction against broader interests in judicial economy and finality.\" (citing Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052). The County argues that courts must \"look to whether the\nsystem provides the essential tools of an effective defense across the broad run of cases,\" and that \"the\nperformance of a particular lawyer or the result in any one case is not decisive.\"\n\n¶ 14. The County then claims that even under the post-conviction cases that use the Strickland analysis, it has\ndemonstrated that the county-based system does not provide the tools of an adequate defense. The County cites\nnumerous post-conviction cases that follow Strickland that have identified other tools that the county-based\nsystem does not provide as fundamental to effective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S.\n510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (investigation of mitigation evidence); Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685,\n122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002) (failure to call witnesses and waiving of argument in sentencing phase); \nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (investigation of mitigation evidence); \nRoe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000) (failure to file notice of appeal); \nSmith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000) (failure to file merits brief without\nconsent); Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (guilty plea challenges). The County\nalso cites several cases decided by this Court such as State v. Tokman, 564 So.2d 1339, 1343 (Miss. 1990)\n(citing Gaines v. Hopper, 575 F.2d 1147, 1150 (5th Cir.1978)), which held that meaningful discussions regarding\nthe realities of a case are the \"cornerstones of effective assistance of counsel.\" Tokman also held that counsel\nhas, at a minimum, \"a duty to interview potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts\nand circumstances of the case.\" State v. Tokman, 564 So.2d at 1342.\n¶ 15. The County also references the Triplett case, in which this Court held that a defendant is entitled to a basic\ndefense, and that a basic defense in Triplett required \"complete investigation to ascertain every material fact\n1039 about this case, favorable and unfavorable.\" Triplett v. State, 666 So.2d 1356, 1361 (Miss.1995). The *1039\nCounty concludes that if the circuit judge had \"assessed the tools of an adequate defense in light of this Court's\nprior decisions and standards, it would have been clear that the county-based system in Quitman and counties\ndoes not provide the essential tools of defense and therefore violates the constitutional guarantee of effective\nassistance of counsel.\"\n¶ 16. The circuit judge's opinion discussed in depth the claims raised by the County regarding the lack of\nessential tools of defense. In response to the County's allegation that \"lack of counsel and excessive caseloads\npromotes pretrial delay... accordingly, excessive pretrial delays have caused Quitman County to spend its own\nfunds to hold defendants in county custody,\" the court stated that testimony during trial established that \"Quitman\nCounty has averaged thirty-four (34) indigent defendants per year in Circuit Court since 1999.\" Further, that \"each\npublic defender is required to be in Justice Court one day each month, an average of seventeen (17) cases per\npublic defender per year in Circuit Court. Certainly, this does not represent an excessive caseload for the two\npublic defenders in Quitman County, as alleged.\" The circuit judge also held that:\nThe two public defenders also take on indigent cases in two neighboring counties in this circuit\ncourt district and also represent private clients. The County contends that the public defenders\naverage 165 cases a year in civil and private and indigent criminal cases, and that this is\nexcessive. The Court is satisfied that those directly involved in the Quitman County criminal justice\nsystem, that is, the two public defenders and the three circuit judges, are in a better position than\nthe Court to judge the weight of their caseload. Each of these testified that the caseload was not\nexcessive and the defenders did not feel overburdened with their caseload. Mr. Shackleford\ntestified that the public defenders were not allowed to schedule other cases during Circuit Court\nterms without permission of the Circuit Court Judge.\nThe circuit judge also attributed the pretrial delay to the fact that \"Quitman County has two terms of court each\nyear, with approximately six months between terms of court, which necessarily results in pretrial delays in\nprocessing felony cases.\" The circuit judge concluded that the delays \"cannot be attributable to the public\ndefender program.\"\n¶ 17. The County also contends that due to the chronic underfunding of indigent defense, the result was\nineffective assistance of counsel which in turn, adversely affected the administration of justice in Mississippi. The\nCounty supports this allegation by stating that there have been \"an unusually high number of guilty pleas entered\non the day of appointment of counsel, public defenders are not provided investigators, public defenders most\noften meet defendants in mass in the courtroom, public defenders are not provided office space, there is little\nmotion practice in Quitman County and that the part-time flat fee public defender system is conducive to\nineffective counsel.\" This argument was not persuasive to the circuit judge because in summary, none of the\n\npublic defenders for this judicial district, circuit judges, or district attorneys testified to this effect. Further, none of\nthe three witnesses tendered by the County as experts concluded in their testimony that either of the public\ndefenders in Quitman County was incompetent. More specifically, Steven Farese, who was accepted as an\nexpert, stated that he understood he was to \"testify as to the regularly accepted methods of defending a criminal\n1040 defendant in an adequate manner and also testify as to what I have observed and read through *1040 the\npractices of Mr. Tisdell and ... Mr. Pearson and Mr. Shackleford and their representation of indigent defendants in\nQuitman County.\" Farese stated that his opinion was that \"there's not one single case that you can point to and\nsay that this person or that person is ineffective because it doesn't work that way,\" but he concluded that the\nsystem as a whole was ineffective.\n¶ 18. Similarly, Dr. Steven Bright, the director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, testified that, with regard\nto his observations on how indigent defense is provided in Quitman County, \"it is not so much about the lawyers\n... I would say it's the system or more precisely the absence of a system that I find impressive.\" The County also\ncomplains about the public defenders' not having investigators, but the circuit judge, in her opinion, stated that\n\"[t]he Mississippi Supreme Court has confirmed that the right to counsel does not require an investigator or\nexpert `absent a showing of substantial need' and has held that the Circuit Court should review such requests on\na case-by-case basis.\" See Hansen v. State, 592 So.2d 114, 125 (Miss.1991).\n¶ 19. Upon consideration of the briefs, the record, and the evidence contained therein, this Court finds that the\ncircuit judge did not apply the wrong legal standard to the County's claims for relief.\nII. Applicable Legal Standard and Financial Injury.\n¶ 20. The County also contends that the circuit judge misconstrued the applicable legal standard with respect to\nfinancial matters. According to the County's interpretation of this Court's previous decision regarding Quitman\nCounty, the County had to \"show the cost of an effective system of indigent criminal defense\" and \"the County's\ninability to fund such a system.\" Quitman I, 807 So.2d at 408. The County avers that it met its burden and\nestablished that it cannot afford to pay any more than it presently does for indigent defense. In response, the\nState claims that the County's evidence regarding its financial condition showed that the County had sufficient\nresources to fund a constitutionally adequate indigent defense system and that the County's obligation to pay for\nindigent defense in non-capital cases has neither caused the County's present economic troubles nor forced the\nCounty to substantially reduce other governmental services.\n¶ 21. More specifically, the County alleged in its complaint that Mississippi's current indigent defense system has\n\"imposed enormous and unpredictable\" costs and that the \"financial resources available to fund schools,\nhospitals, local law enforcement and the traditional health, safety, and welfare obligations of county government\nhave been substantially reduced.\" However, Butch Scipper, the Quitman County Chancery Clerk, admitted that\nthe reason for the unpredictable spikes in budgetary outlays was the expense of defending capital cases00a\n97\npotentially ruinous cost that is no longer borne by the counties. This cost was alleviated by the creation of the\n[1]\nOffice of Post-Conviction Counsel and the Office of Capital Defense Counsel in 2000.  On March 21, 2005,\nGovernor Barbour signed into law effective July 1, 2005, Senate Bill 2960, which creates the Office of Indigent\n1041 Appeals. This newly created office will be responsible for *1041 handling appeals for the indigent defendants that\nhave been convicted of noncapital crimes.\n¶ 22. The circuit judge also found no evidentiary support for the County's assertion that the cost of providing\nindigent defense services had led to decreased funding for other essential services. As previously mentioned, the\ncircuit judge found the County's deficit was \"mainly a result of spending in the area of solid waste, other unfunded\nmandates, natural disasters, and economic development bonds that were not being repaid.\" Again, the circuit\njudge found that \"there was no testimony that resources to fund schools, hospitals, and local law enforcement\nwere reduced because of indigent defense costs as was alleged in the Complaint. The Court is convinced that\nindigent defense is neither the cause nor the solution to the county's financial difficulties.\"\n¶ 23. The County claims that the circuit judge disregarded the evidence it presented through the expert testimony\nwhich unanimously concluded that \"a statewide, state-funded system is needed to provide the tools of an\n\neffective defense.\" The County further explains that \"even if one were to hypothesize a standalone county system\nthat provided adequate defense tools, Mr. Farese's opinion was that it would cost $300,000 to $500,000, 10 to 15\ntimes what Quitman can pay.\" The County asserts that the circuit judge, in addition to disregarding this evidence,\nnever reached the issue framed by this Court and instead, addressed a different one. The County stated that\n\"[u]nder this newly devised test, the county could prevail only if it showed indigent defense was the sole cause of\nthe county's financial problems and that these problems would disappear if the financial burden of indigent\ndefense were lifted.\" The State rebuts this argument by stating:\n[o]f course, the County's expert did not explain why a full time public defenders' office in a county\nwith a population of 10,000 would cost more than the full-time office in a county (Jackson County)\nwith more than 130,000 people. But even assuming that the cost estimate is correct, the County's\nargument ignores a crucial point: The Circuit Court found that Quitman County's system of\nproviding indigent defense services is not providing constitutionally inadequate legal\nrepresentation, even at the current level of funding. Unless the County was able to show that it\nwas providing inadequate services, the question of its ability to pay thousands of dollars more per\nyear simply does not come into play.\n¶ 24. The State correctly points out that the County \"seems to argue that it put on all the proof it needed when\nChancery Clerk Scipper announced that the County cannot afford to pay any more for indigent defense than it\nalready does.\" However, the County does not mention the testimony and documentary evidence that discussed\nthe County's discretionary spending as well as its spending priorities. The State accurately concludes that \"[i]f the\nQuitman County Board of Supervisors made indigent defense a higher priority, the County could find the\nadditional funds00even if that meant less discretionary spending on recreation and similar projects.\"\n97\n¶ 25. Similarly, it was not plausible for the County to maintain that the Legislature is prohibited from imposing\nfinancial burdens on counties because it is well established that each county is an agency or subdivision of the\nstate, created for administration and other public purposes. See State v. Hinds Cty. Bd. of Sup'rs, 635 So.2d 839,\n1042 843 (Miss.1994). As this Court held, \"[t]he revenues of a county are subject to the control of the Legislature, and \n*1042 when the Legislature directs their application to a particular purpose or to the payment of the claims of\nparticular parties, the obligation to so pay is thereby imposed on the county.\" Jackson Cty. v. Neville, 131 Miss.\n599, 95 So. 626, 629 (1923).\n¶ 26. The circuit judge found insufficient evidence that the County's public defenders are providing ineffective\nassistance on a regular basis, and the judge also determined that the County could afford to spend more if it\nchose to and the spending on indigent defense was not the cause of the deficit. The circuit judge's findings are\nnot askew from the applicable standard with which this Court reviews this issue. Therefore, this issue is without\nmerit.\n¶ 27. For the aforementioned reasons, this Court finds that the circuit judge did not apply the wrong legal\nstandard in concluding that the County did not prove financial injury.\nIII. Two Key Evidentiary Rulings.\n¶ 28. The standard of review on appeal from evidentiary rulings is prescribed by Rule 103(a) of the Mississippi\nRules of Evidence, which states \"[e]rror may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence\nunless a substantial right of the party is affected....\" This Court articulated the standard of review of evidentiary\nrulings and stated that \"[o]ur standard of review for the admission of or refusal to admit evidence is well settled.\n`Admission or suppression of evidence is within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be reversed absent an\nabuse of that discretion.'\" Church of God Pentecostal, Inc. v. Freewill Pentecostal Church of God, Inc., 716 So.2d\n200, 210 (Miss.1998) (citing Broadhead v. Bonita Lakes Mall, Ltd. P'ship, 702 So.2d 92, 102 (Miss.1997) (quoting\nSumrall v. Miss. Power Co., 693 So.2d 359, 365 (Miss. 1997))).\n¶ 29. In applying that standard, the reviewing court may reverse a case only if \"the admission or exclusion of\nevidence,. . . result[s] in prejudice and harm or adversely affect[s] a substantial right of a party.\" K-Mart Corp. v.\nHardy, 735 So.2d 975, 983 (Miss.1999) (citing Hansen v. State, 592 So.2d 114, 132 (Miss.1991)). Abuse of\n\ndiscretion is found when the reviewing court has a \"definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a\nclear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon weighing of relevant factors.\" Caracci v. Int'l Paper Co.,\n699 So.2d 546, 556 (Miss.1997). Accordingly, the reviewing court \"must let stand a trial judge's findings of\nevidentiary or ultimate fact when substantial evidence in the record supports those findings, or when the findings\nare not `clearly erroneous.'\" Crowe v. Smith, 603 So.2d 301, 305 (Miss. 1992) (quoting Matter of Estate of\nVarvaris, 528 So.2d 800, 802 (Miss.1988)).\n¶ 30. The County claims that the circuit judge committed prejudicial error in two evidentiary rulings, which in turn,\naffected a substantial right of Quitman County. The first purported error occurred when the circuit judge barred\nthe County from introducing expert testimony that the indigent defense system has affected the independence\nand effectiveness of the courts, and the second purported error occurred when the judge allowed local circuit\njudges to offer their opinions on the competence of the public defenders.\nExpert testimony\n¶ 31. The County interprets this Court's previous decision as identifying as a triable issue whether \"the county-\nbased system has resulted in the inability of the judiciary to operate in an independent and effective manner.\" \n1043 Quitman I, 807 So.2d at 410. The County also concludes, from *1043 this Court's previous opinion, that if such\nan effect is shown, then this Court must necessarily intervene and \"order the Legislature to establish a statewide,\nstatefunded system of indigent defense.\" Id. The County also contends that the circuit court barred it from\nintroducing evidence on the issue that the \"integrity of the judicial system has been compromised by the State's\nfailure to provide the essential tools of an effective defense.\" The County alleges that this evidence was \"critical\nto the outcome of this case.\" Farese was asked if he had \"any fears for the integrity of our court system, should\nthe system of indigent defense here in Quitman County continue?\" The State's objection was based on relevancy\nbecause the State was unsure how \"fears of integrity\" related to Article 3, Section 26 of the Mississippi\nConstitution. Miss. R. Evid. 401 defines \"relevant evidence\" as \"evidence having any tendency to make the\nexistence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\nthan it would be without the evidence.\" The comment to Rule 401 states that \"[i]f the evidence has any probative\nvalue at all, the rule favors admission.\" The County contends that \"[a]s was apparent from the context in which\nthe questions were asked, Mr. Farese's expert opinion would have been that the county-based system of indigent\ndefense system has compromised the integrity of the criminal justice system in Mississippi00an ultimate issue in\n97\nthe case under Miss. R. Evid. 70400and described the ways in which that compromise has occurred.\"\n97\n¶ 32. However, at trial, the State argued that such opinion testimony was inadmissible, irrelevant, and unhelpful in\nthe sense that allowing attorneys to testify as experts on the ultimate legal issue simply invites a \"battle of experts\non an issue which is squarely resolvable only by the Court.\" Thomas M. Fortner, the public defender for Hinds\nCounty, was accepted as an expert in the field of indigent defense. Further, the circuit judge acknowledged that\nalthough having attorneys experts offering opinions on the ultimate legal issue might not be very helpful, she\nwould allow:\nthis witness [Fortner] to testify as an expert in the field offered of indigent defense and I do think\nthat he has specialized knowledge through his experience and training. And as to the ultimate\nquestion or the legal conclusion which must be drawn, that is a question for the Court and I would\njust as soon you stay away from it. But I know that there are matters that Mr. Fortner can assist\nthe Court on and I will allow him to testify and give those opinions.\nIn other words, the circuit judge would allow expert opinion on specific fact-based matters and would be less\ninclined to hear sweeping, unsupported opinions. The Comment to Miss. R. Evid. 704 solidifies the judge's\npurpose in asking the parties to \"stay away\" from opinions on the ultimate issue. The Comment to Rule 704\nstates that even though \"ultimate issue\" opinions may be admissible, \"[a] question may not be asked which is\nbased on inadequately explored legal criteria since the answer would not be helpful.\" As the State correctly\nasserted, \"[t]he trial court, who was sitting as the trier of fact, was merely giving the parties some guidance about\nwhat opinion testimony would be useful in deciding the issues.\" The circuit judge's approach to the expert\ntestimony offered in the case sub judice was that the court, sitting as a trier of fact, did not find it helpful to have a\n\nparade of experts declaring ex cathedra that the system is unconstitutional. Simply stated, the circuit judge\nallowed opinion testimony as long as there was sufficient background testimony to render the opinion helpful.\n1044 *1044 ¶ 33. It was against this background that Farese took the stand and offered his many opinions regarding\nindigent defense systems in general and Quitman County in particular. As the State correctly points out, Farese's\nextensive testimony took up almost one-hundred pages of the trial transcript. The circuit judge only refused to\nallow Farese to answer two final questions. The County alleges that the exclusion of this \"one last question\" for\nFarese's opinion on the \"integrity of the court system\" constituted reversible error. Farese had already addressed\nhis specific concerns about the indigent defense system in his extensive testimony, and allowing one final,\nsweeping opinion during re-direct examination was redundant and unnecessary. Therefore, the circuit judge's\ndecision was not an abuse of discretion.\nTestimony of circuit judges\n¶ 34. The County claimed that the circuit judge committed reversible error by allowing three circuit judges to\ntestify and offer opinions about the competency of the public defenders after instructing the County to \"stay away\nfrom\" expert testimony on ultimate questions of fact. The County further alleged that the circuit judge \"gave\ndispositive weight to these conclusory opinions, which had little or no evidentiary foundation in the record.\" The\ncircuit judge explained her reasoning for rejecting the County's request to exclude the judges' testimony by\nobserving that it would have been unfair to allow the County to challenge the constitutionality of \"this very system\nover which these three circuit judges preside\" but not let the judges share their observations on how the system\nworks.\n¶ 35. When the State announced at pretrial that it intended to call sitting circuit judges to testify, and the County\nmoved in limine to exclude the anticipated testimony, the circuit judge denied the motion. In doing so, she stated\nthat she would not compel their testimony, nor would she allow them to be called as expert witnesses or offer\nlegal opinions. She further stated that these circuit judges \"do have much information basically based on their\nown personal observations which would be helpful to this trier of fact.\"\n¶ 36. When Circuit Judge Albert B. Smith, III, was called to the stand, the court reiterated, for the benefit of the\nwitness as well as the parties, that his testimony should remain limited to personal observations about how the\nQuitman County public defender system works. Judge Smith made general observations about the public\ndefenders' \"winning a lot of their cases\" as well as the frequency and quality of motions. Judge Smith stated that\n\"[t]hey file motions with me, and they ask for expert witnesses in certain cases, and they, of course, try the cases\nthemselves. As far as being prepared, I think they have a pretty good track record as far as their wins.\" Judge\nSmith also specifically addressed plea agreements and the procedure thereof, which was an area greatly\ncriticized by the County. He even said that \"a lot of times I repeat what's in the petition and sometimes more so\nwhen a defendant is one that has a low education or . . . doesn't seem to comprehend exactly what the scenario\nis. Sometimes we will take a break, and I will let him go and confer with his attorney.\"\n¶ 37. Circuit Judge Larry Lewis was then called to testify about the appointment of public defenders in Quitman\nCounty Circuit Court, the judges' standard practices for accepting pleas, and the public defenders' handling of\nmotions and trials. He explained that the judges require each defendant to \"certify to the Court that the defendant\n1045 has informed his lawyer [of] everything he knows about the charge, the facts of the case,\" before the court will \n*1045 accept the guilty plea. Judge Smith stated that purpose of the plea colloquy is to ensure that this\ncommunication occurs between the attorney and his client. He also said that the circuit judges directly ask each\ndefendant whether or not he committed the crime and stated that \"[i]f the defendant falters in any way at that\npoint, the plea is off.\" Judge Lewis further attested to the fact that he had observed Quitman County public\ndefenders both in his capacity as a county prosecutor as well as a circuit judge, and that he always found them\nwell-prepared. He also testified that the public defenders regularly file various motions, including motions to\nsuppress evidence, and he stated that he had not observed any differences in how the public defenders\nrepresented their indigent clients as opposed to their paying clients. When he was asked whether the public\ndefenders were \"effective advocates,\" Judge Lewis carefully limited his answer to the \"results of their work\" and\ntestified that they were competent in the sense that they prevail in many of their cases.\n\n¶ 38. The personal knowledge of the judges regarding what they observe the lawyers doing in their courtroom\nwas the reason that they were called as witnesses. The circuit judge did not abuse her discretion by relying on\nthe judges' testimony to help her determine whether the public defenders' caseload was excessive, whether\nindigent defendants were entering into ill-advised plea agreements, and whether the public defenders take their\nobligations as such seriously. Furthermore, the circuit judge did not treat their testimony as expert opinion\ntestimony on the issue of whether the public defenders were providing constitutionally adequate representation,\nso the admission thereof was not erroneous.\nIV. Other Evidence.\n¶ 39. The County avers that the circuit judge \"ignored entire categories of expert and lay witness testimony,\nauthoritative standards, government studies, and defense witness admissions establishing key facts that the [this]\nCourt held are determinative of Quitman's claims.\" However, the County incorrectly accuses the circuit judge of\nignoring that evidence simply because she refused to draw inferences favorable to the County or because she\nfound the County's evidence less probative than that submitted by the State. In its brief, the State accurately\nasserts that the County cannot retry its case on appeal and states that this Court is required to accept as true all\n\"evidence which supports or reasonably tends to support the findings of fact made below, together with all\nreasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom and which favor the lower court's finding of fact. That there\nmay be other evidence to the contrary is irrelevant.\" Par Indus., Inc. v. Target Container Co., 708 So.2d 44, 47\n(Miss.1998) (internal citations omitted). The County's argument fails to consider the evidence within the record\nthat was unfavorable to its position.\n¶ 40. For example, the County points out that its public defenders have a total caseload of around 165 cases per\nyear, even though the American Bar Association standards recommend handling no more than 150 cases per\nyear. Since the court heard first-hand testimony about the caseload of the public defenders in Quitman County\nwhich indicated that they were not overwhelmed by their work, the County could not reasonably expect the circuit\njudge to have found that the public defenders' handling of 165 cases instead of 150 cases had either resulted in\nor contributed to widespread ineffective assistance of counsel.\n1046 *1046 ¶ 41. The County, by asserting the circuit judge ignored evidence, also fails to take into account the\ntestimony of the circuit judges which contradicts the contentions of the County. The County also fails to address\nthe public defenders' testimony about how they generally conduct investigations themselves and decide on a\ncase-by-case basis whether or not to use the services of a professional investigator or retain an expert witness,\nways in which they use their own offices, secretarial staff, computers, and other resources, conduct discovery,\nand communicate with clients. As previously referenced, the testimony of the judges and public defenders was\nthe only first-hand account of how the system actually operated, so the circuit judge properly considered the\ntestimony helpful in determining whether there has been a widespread ineffective assistance of counsel in\nQuitman County as a result of the county-based indigent defense system. The State correctly contends that\n\"[e]ven if the County had prevailed on the first issue addressed by the Circuit Court, the County still would not\nhave been entitled to the relief it requested. In making this argument, the State cites to Wilson v. State, 574 So.2d\nat 1340-41, where this Court did not find sufficient grounds with which to enjoin the Legislature to expend public\nfunds on the defense of indigent criminals.\n¶ 42. For the reasons previously enumerated, this Court finds that the circuit judge's decision is not against the\noverwhelming evidence or an abuse of her discretion, but is instead, amply supported by the evidence presented\nat trial.\nV. This Court's Prior Dissent and Personal Opinion.\n¶ 43. This Court's \"review of a chancellor's findings of fact is the manifest error/substantial evidence rule.\" Miss.\nState Tax Comm'n v. Med. Devices, Inc., 624 So.2d 987, 989 (Miss.1993). The findings of the circuit court are\naccorded the same deference as a chancellor's fact findings. Kight v. Sheppard Bldg. Supply, Inc., 537 So.2d\n1355, 1358 (Miss.1989) (citing Hardy v. First Nat'l Bank, 505 So.2d 1021, 1023 (Miss.1987)).\n\n¶ 44. The County's final assignment of error is based on the closing paragraphs of the circuit court's opinion. In\nits brief, the County avers that the circuit judge violated Canon 3 A of the Code of Judicial Conduct by injecting\n\"an unfortunate note of personal opinion into a decision of statewide significance and constitutional import, and\ncontrary to the expressed view of the majority of the Quitman Court.\" The passages the County found\nobjectionable are quoted in full as follows:\nThe County bears the burden of proving that the rights of indigent defendants are being violated in\nQuitman County and across the state to the extent that this court should hold the funding scheme\nestablished by our legislature as unconstitutional. While this lawsuit has raised issues of statewide\nconcern which give rise to serious constitutional dilemmas, the Court concludes that the County\nfalls short of demonstrating that indigent defendants in Quitman County are receiving ineffective\nassistance of counsel. Additionally, the County has not proven that the county-based system has\nresulted in the inability of the judiciary to operate in an independent and effective manner . . . This\nCourt cannot say that this is one of those rare occasions when the courts should exercise its\ninherent power and `interfere with this traditionally legislative function and order the Legislature to\nestablish a statewide, state-funded system of indigent defense.'\n1047 *1047 The question before this Court is not whether the county-based system is the best system of indigent\ndefense. The question is not even whether in isolated cases the public defenders were ineffective. Rather, the\nquestion is whether Mississippi's county-based system is a constitutionally adequate system of indigent defense.\nThis Court finds that our system meets constitutional demands. This is not to say that another approach would\nnot be more desirable. This Court agrees with the sentiments expressed by three justices in the dissenting\nopinion in State v. Quitman County, 807 So.2d at 413 (Pittman, C.J., dissenting):\nI agree that it would be wise of the Legislature to create and fund a statewide public defenders'\noffice. However, the Legislature has attempted to solve the problem of indigent defense in other\nways. By its actions, the Legislature has shown that it is not blind to the plight of Quitman County.\nIt is the Legislature which hold the key to solving these problems, not this Court by impressive and\nexcessive exercise of judicial authority.\nThe County asserts that by quoting the dissent and expressing her agreement, the circuit judge based her\nopinion on materials outside the scope of prevailing law. The County further questions her fidelity to the law, as\nrequired by Canon 3 A of the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct.\n¶ 45. This argument is without merit because the circuit judge found that County did not meet its burden at trial,\nthen it is not entitled to the possible relief that was enumerated by the majority of the Court in Quitman. Although\nher ideas regarding the proper way to gain the relief sought if the burden had been met were contrary to the\nmajority's opinion, she was in no way violating her duty to remain faithful to the law. Clearly, the circuit judge\nrecognized that even though the county-based system may not be the \"best\" way, it is constitutional. As the State\npoints out, the circuit judge's \"ability to distinguish between her own personal views about the desirability of a\nstatewide public defenders' office and her judicial authority to grant that relief given the facts of this case is\ncommendable; it is not grounds for reversal.\" This Court, in Hosford v. State, 525 So.2d 789, 798 (Miss. 1988),\nheld that while the Legislature has the authority \"to furnish what funds and facilities it deems proper,\" the courts\nmay, nevertheless act in cases of necessity when the Legislature fails to furnish the essentials required for the\noperation of an independent and effective court. Quitman I, 807 So.2d at 410 (quoting Hosford, 525 So.2d at 798\n). Conclusively, the County did not meet its burden of proving that the county-based system has resulted in\nwidespread ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, the County cannot carry the further burden of showing\nthat its requested injunction was the proper remedy. The County urges this Court to implement a remedy that falls\nwithin the purview of the Legislature instead of the judiciary.\n¶ 46. This Court recognizes that multiple amicus curiae briefs have been filed with this Court, and the majority of\nwhich, encourage this Court to order the Legislature to move to a state-wide indigent defense system. Some of\nthe amici include in support of the County's position are: the Mississippi Trial Lawyers Association, Sheriffs of\nQuitman County, et al., the Mississippi Association of Supervisors, the National Legal Aid and Defender\nAssociation, the Mississippi Circuit Clerks' Association and the Mississippi Chancery Clerks' Association, NAACP\n\n1048 Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. and 100 Black Men of Jackson, Inc. The only amicus brief filed *1048\nin support of the State was filed by the Mississippi State Legislators.\nCONCLUSION\n¶ 47. For the reasons set forth above, this Court finds that the circuit judge was correct in concluding that\nQuitman County did not met its burden of proving that the funding mechanism established by statute led to\nsystemic ineffective assistance of counsel in Quitman County and throughout the state. Therefore, the judgment\nof the circuit court is affirmed.\n¶ 48. AFFIRMED.\nWALLER AND COBB, P.JJ., EASLEY, CARLSON AND RANDOLPH, JJ., CONCUR. GRAVES, J., DISSENTS\nWITH SEPARATE WRITTEN OPINION JOINED BY DICKINSON, J. DIAZ, J., NOT PARTICIPATING.\nGRAVES, Justice, Dissenting:\n¶ 49. The majority holds that the trial court applied the correct legal standard to Quitman County's (\"Quitman\")\nclaims of relief. However, the trial judge's analysis of the facts focused on isolated cases, rather than the\nsystemic challenge brought by Quitman. Further, the trial court's failure to consider credible, unrebutted evidence\nestablishing the deficiencies of Quitman's indigent defense system severely undermined its ruling. Applying the\ncorrect legal standard to the credible evidence in this case, Quitman is entitled to the relief sought. Therefore, I\nrespectfully dissent.\nTrial Court Applied the Incorrect Legal Standard\n¶ 50. Three years ago, this Court ruled that if Quitman could demonstrate that a lack of state funding resulted in a\nlocal system of indigent defense representation \"fall[ing] beneath the minimum standard of representation\nrequired by the Mississippi Constitution,\" then Quitman would have established that the State \"breached its\nconstitutional duty to provide indigent defendants with effective assistance of counsel. See State v. Quitman\nCounty, 807 So.2d 401, 408-09 (Miss.2001) (\"Quitman I\"). In Quitman I, this Court allowed Quitman, upon\nsatisfying the above threshold, to seek prospective relief from the State. Significantly, in our earlier opinion, this\nCourt neither stated nor implied that in order for Quitman to succeed it needed to show prejudice to any particular\nclient.\n¶ 51. The majority points out that the circuit court \"unambiguously stated that the question before it was not\n`whether in isolated cases the public defenders were ineffective.'\" The trial court failed in its attempt to correctly\nframe and address the relevant issue. Focusing on the incorrect issue (the isolated cases where the public\ndefenders were ineffective), the trial court then applied the incorrect legal standard. The trial court applied the\nhigher, two-part test used only for post-conviction challenges by individual criminal defendants under Howard v.\nState, 853 So.2d 781 (Miss.2003) and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80\nL.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Essentially, the circuit court proceeded as if this were an individual post-conviction\nproceeding and Quitman had to prove on a case-by-case basis that the attorney's performance was deficient and\nthe defendant was prejudiced, i.e., but for these deficiencies, there would have been a different outcome at trial.\nTo this end, the circuit court repeatedly criticized Quitman's proof for supposed failure to show \"incompetence\"\nand prejudice in particular cases that would have warranted reversal of the conviction under Howard and \nStrickland. These criticisms were unwarranted considering that the record is replete with evidence of\n1049 incompetence and ineffectiveness *1049 in the operation of Quitman's indigent defense services.\n¶ 52. Here, the circuit court fundamentally misconceived Quitman's case and arguments. Quitman's complaint is\nthat \"the existing county-based system results in an inadequate and unconstitutional system of indigent defense.\"\nQuitman never sought to overturn particular convictions, but rather to challenge the constitutionality of systemic\nineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, the trial court's requirement that Quitman demonstrate some form of\nprejudice was completely misguided and legally erroneous. Because Quitman I allowed Quitman to seek\n\nprospective relief, I am convinced that a prejudice requirement is wholly inappropriate in a case where\nprospective relief is sought.\n¶ 53. Other courts have concluded that prospective challenges to indigent defense systems are not subject to the\nrequirements of Strickland and that the proper inquiry is whether the system provides the tools of an adequate\ndefense. See Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1017 (11th Cir. 1988); State v. Peart, 621 So.2d 780, 791\n(La.1993) (creating \"rebuttable presumption\" that \"indigents . . . are receiving assistance of counsel not\nsufficiently effective to meet constitutionally required standards\" to be applied prospectively); New York County\nLawyers' Ass'n v. State, 192 Misc.2d 424, 745 N.Y.S.2d 376, 384 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.2002).\n¶ 54. The distinction between the standards applicable to post-conviction proceedings and to systemic\nchallenges rests on the very different policies applicable in the two kinds of cases. In a post-conviction challenge,\ncourts attempt to balance the individual defendant's interest in challenging his conviction against broader\ninterests in judicial economy and finality. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The concerns about\ncertainty and finality of past criminal convictions do not arise in systemic cases. In those cases, society's interest\nin the provision of an effective defense to all citizens is of paramount proportions. See Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d\nat 1017; New York County Lawyers Ass'n v. State, 745 N.Y.S.2d at 384. Accordingly, courts look to whether the\nsystem provides the essential tools of an effective defense across the broad run of cases; the performance of a\nparticular lawyer or the result in any one case is not decisive.\n¶ 55. Because the trial court failed to properly consider Quitman's systemic challenge to the county's indigent\ndefense system, and thereafter applied an incorrect legal standard, I cannot agree that either the trial court or the\nmajority reached the correct result.\nThe Trial Court Failed to Consider Credible, Unrebutted Evidence as\nto the Deficiencies of Quitman's Indigent Defense System\n¶ 56. Upon a through review of the record and briefs in the instant case, it is apparent that the circuit court\ncompletely ignored entire categories of expert and lay witness testimony, authoritative standards, governmental\nstudies, and defense witness admissions which highlighted the deficiencies of Quitman's indigent defense\nsystem. For instance, in determining whether essential tools were provided to a defendant to assist in his\ndefense, courts look to objective criteria promulgated by the American Bar Association and other standard-setting\nbodies. See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 522-23, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 2536-37, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003)\n(counsel failed to go beyond pre-sentence report and social services records in investigating mitigating evidence,\nas required by ABA standards); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 396, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)\n1050 (counsel did not investigate *1050 and present substantial mitigating evidence, as ABA standards prescribe); \nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. (\"Prevailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar\nAssociation standards and the like, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-1.1 to 4-8.6 (2d ed. 1980) (\"The\nDefense Function\"), are guides to determining what is reasonable\"). While these standards and their applicability\nto Quitman were briefed extensively to the trial court, there is no indication that the trial court ever considered\nthem.\n¶ 57. There are at least three substantial reasons why the trial court should have utilized the ABA Criminal Justice\nStandards for the Defense Function (\"ABA Defense Function Standards\") as a benchmark for determining\nwhether Quitman's indigent defense system violates the Mississippi Constitution: (1) the standards represent the\nlegal community's consensus as to the minimum required of an indigent defense system; (2) this Court and other\ncourts rely on the ABA standards to determine compliance with the constitutional mandate of effective assistance\nof counsel, and (3) the standards mirror this Court's holdings regarding the minimum requirements of a\nconstitutional indigent defense system. By ignoring the intelligible framework of the ABA standards, the trial court\nfaced a tremendous disadvantage in assessing the constitutionality of Quitman's indigent defense system.\n¶ 58. In addition to the authoritative standards of the ABA, the trial court ignored volumes of credible, unrebutted\nevidence which was determinative of Quitman's claims. This Court has long held that it is reversible error for a\ntrial court to ignore uncontradicted evidence. Lucedale Veneer Co. v. Rogers, 211 Miss. 613, 53 So.2d 69, 75\n\n(1951) (\"[E]vidence which is not contradicted by positive testimony or circumstances, and is not inherently\nimprobable, incredible, or unreasonable, cannot be arbitrarily or capriciously discredited, disregarded, or rejected.\n. . .\"); Tarver v. Lindsey, 161 Miss. 379, 137 So. 93, 96 (1931) (\"Where, as in this case, the testimony of\nwitnesses is undisputed, is reasonable in itself, . . . . and the witnesses are unimpeached, then the trier of facts\nmust act on the testimony and cannot reject it, else trial might eventuate in arbitrary results . . .\"); Holmes v.\nHolmes, 154 Miss. 713, 123 So. 865, 866-67 (1929) (reversing lower court's dismissal where trial court ignored\nboth the undisputed testimony of a clerk with direct personal knowledge of the transaction at issue, as well as a\nletter written by defendant containing important admissions).\n¶ 59. Here, the record contains undisputed expert and lay witness testimony establishing that the county-based\nsystem fails to provide the tools of an adequate statewide defense system. Many court-appointed defense\nattorneys throughout the State do not file pretrial motions, use experts or invest the time necessary to represent\ntheir indigent clients effectively. In addition to lacking governmental oversight, these attorneys have no\nadministrative or investigative support to assist in the representation of their clients. The trial court ignored the\nfollowing evidence:\na. There are a substantial number of instances where neither lawyer nor defendant recognize\neach other at arraignment, and prisoners remain in jail up to 4 to 5 months without any contact\nwith their attorney.\nb. Client meetings are held in groups in the courtroom within earshot of the prosecutor and the\njudge.\nc. Public defenders routinely waive preliminary hearings, accept facts in indictments, and do not\nask for investigators or experts.\n1051 d. There is no opportunity for the investigation or communication necessary *1051 to make an\ninformed decision when pleas are entered on arraignment day.\ne. There is a vast disparity between the resources of the State and public defenders.\n¶ 60. Governmental studies have repeatedly found that the tools of an adequate defense are missing in county\n[2]\nindigent defense systems. For instances, the Spangenberg studies  found that \"funding for indigent defense is\ntotally inadequate,\" \"the lack of adequate resources for indigent defense services results in poor quality services\nand representation,\" \"there is no state wide oversight of indigent defense, which leads to a hodgepodge, county-\nby-county approach to providing services,\" and \"[e]very aspect of defense representation is compromised.\"\n[3]\nSimilarly, the Mississippi Public Defenders Task Force report  concluded that \"indigent defense remained a\nvexing problem for the counties\" and contained deeply troubling reports by several circuit court judges describing\nsystemic inadequacies they have observed in their districts. While this information was available to the trial court,\nits opinion does not refer to these repeated findings of inadequate representation.\nNeed for a Statewide Indigent Defense System\n¶ 61. The Mississippi Constitution, Article 3, § 26, has been interpreted to create a duty on the part of the state to\nprovide effective assistance of counsel to indigent defendants. See Quitman I, 807 So.2d at 406-07. This Court\nhas recognized that this means that indigent defendants must be provided with the tools of an adequate defense.\nHarrison v. State, 635 So.2d 894, 901 (Miss.1994) (citing Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 77, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84\nL.Ed.2d 53 (1985)). Further, this Court has recognized that these \"tools\" which are necessary to construct an\nadequate defense vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. Harrison, 635 So.2d at 901\n(citing State v. Acosta, 41 Or.App. 257, 597 P.2d 1282, 1284 (1979)). Among these tools which allow defendants\nto construct an adequate defense is the right to counsel. The Sixth Amendment provides, \"In all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\" The U.S.\nSupreme Court has construed this to mean that in federal courts counsel must be provided for defendants unable\nto employ counsel unless the right is competently and intelligently waived. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335,\n339-40, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). In Gideon, the Supreme Court recognized the dire importance of the\n\nright to counsel and ruled that the Sixth Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions that the accused\nshall enjoy the right to assistance of counsel for his defense, and that this right is made obligatory on the states\nby the Fourteenth amendment, and indigent defendants in criminal prosecutions in states courts enjoy the same\nright. Id. at 342-44, 83 S.Ct. 792. Because the Supreme Court has deemed the right to counsel for indigents in\nstate prosecutions to be fundamental, the State of Mississippi bears the ultimate responsibility to ensure that this\n1052 right is preserved. After all, the crime *1052\nwhich the defendant is accused of is against the peace and tranquility of the State. The State will shoulder the\nultimate financial responsibility of housing the defendant provided that the State is successful in its prosecution.\nAnd it will be the state judiciary which will ultimately hear and decide any appeals.\n¶ 62. I am convinced that Quitman County's indigent defense system wholly fails to measure up to legal as well\nas recognized, authoritative standards. To this end, Quitman's system is in fact delivering constitutionally\ninadequate assistance of counsel to indigent defendants. The Quitman County indigent defense system fails\nacross the board to safeguard the most fundamental protections necessary for the equitable administration of\njustice. Mississippi has neglected to ensure that the indigent defense systems in the counties are able to operate\nindependently, that workloads are controlled, that appropriate oversight is in place, and that defendants are\nallowed confidential access to an attorney who will investigate the facts of each case. The flaws apparent in\nQuitman's system are not unique. Rather, they are the result of the fundamental problem in a part-time, county-\nbased system that lacks state funding and uniformity. In essence, the State of Mississippi has failed to establish\nor fund a system of indigent defense that is equipped to provide all defendants with the tools of an adequate\ndefense, and has therefore fallen short of its constitutional obligation. Therefore, I would reverse the trial court's\njudgment and remand this case to the trial court for further remedial proceedings. For these reasons, I\nrespectfully dissent.\nDICKINSON, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n[1] As previously noted, during the 2005 Regular Session, the Mississippi Legislature took an initial step toward\nthat end by passage of Senate Bill 2960, which creates and provides for administration and funding of the\nMississippi Office of Indigent Appeals. Approved by the Governor on March 21, 2005, this act became effective\non July 1, 2005.\n[2] The Spangenberg Group, a nationally known consulting organization with expertise in indigent defense\nsystems, prepared a comprehensive report (in contemplation of the current litigation) on Mississippi's indigent\ndefense systems under the auspices of the Mississippi Bar Association.\n[3] The Mississippi Public Defenders Task Force issued its September 29, 2000, report pursuant to a legislative\nmandate to recommend improvements to the indigent defense systems in criminal proceedings throughout the\nState of Mississippi.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

It  can  offer  this  Court  a  unique  perspective  on  the  issues  presented  in  the  State  of \nMississippi’s interlocutory appeal from the denial of its  motion to dismiss.  For these  same reasons, \nthe  Bar was  granted leave to  file as amicus  curiae  in  Wilson  v.  State,  574  So.  2d  1338  (Miss.  1990), \nthis  Court’s  seminal case  involving the provision  of legal  services to  indigent persons  charged with \nfelonies. \nIt  is  of vital  importance  to  the  Bar  that  this  Court  take  significant  steps  in  improving  the \nsystem  for  providing  effective  assistance  of counsel  to  indigent  defendants,  which  is  a  function \nassigned to  the  States  by the  Sixth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to the  United  States  Constitution. \nIn  Wilson,  this  Court attempted to  establish  guidelines  for  such a system based  on existing  statutes. \nIt  is  now  unfortunately  clear  that  Wilson  did  not  succeed  in  this  task.  The  Mississippi  Bar \nestablished  a  Criminal  Justice  Task  Force  which,  among  other  things,  recommended  the \nestablishment  of a  full-time public  defender’s office  in  each Circuit  Court  district,  to  be  funded by \nthe  State  of Mississippi.  The  Task  Force’s  recommendations  were  adopted  by  the  Board  of Bar \nCommissioners  and  continue to  be  the  policy  of The Mississippi  Bar.  The  Bar thus  has  substantial \nlegitimate interests  that  may otherwise  escape  the  Court’s attention  if the  Bar’s Amicus  Brief is not \nconsidered  on  this  appeal. \n10:99075719.1  |  i\nARGUMENT \nOver  ten  years  ago,  this  Court  considered  the  provision  of  legal  services  to  indigent \ndefendants  in  Wilson  v.  State,  574  So.  2d  1338  (Miss.  1990).  In  Wilson,  two  attorneys  who \nrepresented  an  indigent  charged  with  capital  murder  expended  779.2  and  562  hours,  respectively, \non  the  defendant’s  case,  but  were  only  compensated  $1,000  apiece,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of \nMiss.  Code  Ann.  §99-15-17.  The  Court  recognized  that  issues  of constitutional  proportion  were \npresented  by  the  severe  disparity  between  the  reasonable  and  necessary  work  expended  by  the \nattorneys  and  the  compensation  to  the  attorneys  for  that  work.  Thus  the  Court  was  required  to \n“construe  [the statute]  to enable it to withstand the constitutional  attack and to carry  out the purpose \nembedded  in  the  statute.”  Wilson,  574  So.  2d  at  1340. \nOf great concern to the  Court  in  Wilson was the division of Constitutional  authority between \nthe judicial  and  the  legislative  branches  of government.  From  the  Constitutional  establishment  of \nan  independent judiciary the  Wilson  Court  derived two  foundational  principles.  The  first was  “the \nduty on the part of the Legislative branch to provide sufficient funds and facilities for them to operate \nindependently and  effectively.”  Wilson,  574  So.  2d  at  1339,  quoting Hosford v.  State,  325  So.  2d \n789,  797-98  (Miss.  1988).  Because  the  primary  responsibility  for  the  fiscal  management  of \ngovernment resides with the Legislature, the judiciary grants the legislative branch  broad discretion \nto  provide the  funds  and  facilities  with which the judicial  system  operates.  /d. \nBut, although “[t]his discretionary authority of the Legislature  is wide  indeed .  .  .  it does not \ncover the entire spectrum.”  /d.  Thus,  “if [the Legislature]  fails to  fulfill  a constitutional  obligation \nto  enable  the  judicial  branch  to  operate  independently  and  effectively,  then  it  has  violated  its \nConstitutional  mandate,  and  the judicial  branch  has  the  authority and the  duty to  see that courts  do \n30:99075719.1  1\nnot atrophy.”  Wilson,  574  So.  2d at  1339-40, quoting Hosford,  525  So. 2d at 797-98.  And this leads \nto  the  second  principle  of  Wilson  —  that  where  the  Legislature  has  not  provided  a  means  for  the \n“independent and effective” operation of the judiciary,  it is the “absolute duty” of the courts  “to  act, \nand  to  act promptly.” \nThe balance between these two mandates was certainly not novel to Hosford or Wilson.  This \nCourt’s  approach  to  cases  on  the  borderline  between  the  realms  of the  judiciary  and  legislative \nbranches of government is  characterized as follows:  a ruling  which establishes the constitutionally- \nmandated  standards  for  an  independent  and  effective  judiciary,  but  which  allows  the  legislative \nbranch  an opportunity  to  exercise  its  discretion  to  implement  those  standards.  Thus,  in Jackson  v, \nState, 337 So. 2d  1242,  1253 (Miss.  1976), this Court interpreted the then-existing capital sentencing \nstatute to establish guidelines for bifurcated trials in capital murder cases, so as to meet the standards \nof the Eighth Amendment to the  United  States Constitution.  The  statute  interpreted by the Court in \nJackson  had  no  such  guidelines;  shortly  thereafter,  the  Legislature  enacted  the  present  version  of \nMiss.  Code  Ann.  §99-19-101,  for  the  most  part  following  this  Court’s  leadership. \nWhile  Wilson  teaches  that the  exercise  of judicial  authority  to  ensure  the  independence  and \nefficiency of the judiciary, and the promotion of justice,  should  be limited  to  the  “cases  of absolute \nnecessity,”  Wilson,  574  So.  2d  at  1350,  this  Court  does  not  hesitate  to  enter  the  fray  when needed. \nMost  famously,  in  1981,  the  Supreme  Court  promulgated  the  current  Mississippi  Rules  of  Civil \nProcedure pursuant to  its constitutional authority “to promote justice,  uniformity, and the  efficiency \nof courts” as declared Newell v.  State,  308  So.  2d  71  (Miss.  1975).  This  Court will recall that ruling \nwas  controversial  at  the  time,  see,  e.g.,  W.H.  Page,  “Constitutionalism  and Judicial  Rulemaking: \nLessons from  the  Crisis  in  Mississippi,”  3  Miss.  Coll.  L.  Rev.  1  (1992);  P.B.  Herbert,  “Process, \n10:99075719.1  2\nProcedure and Constitutionalism: A  Response  to Professor Page,”  3  Miss.  Coll.  L.Rev.  45  (1992). \nHowever, ultimately the Legislature responded by reaffirming this Court’s rulemaking responsibility. \nMiss.  Code  Ann.  §9-3-61  (Rev.  1996). \nSimilarly, after patiently enduring the  legislative  response  to Pruett  v.  City of Rosedale,  421 \nSo. 2d  1046 (Miss.  1982) which abrogated the judicially created doctrine of sovereign immunity, this \nCourt required the Legislature  to create  a  system to  compensate persons  injured  by  State-employed \ntortfeasors  in Presley  y.  Miss.  State  Hwy  Comm’n,  608  So.  2d  1288  (Miss.  1992).  The  Legislature \ndid  so,  by  enacting  the  Mississippi  Tort Claims  Act,  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §11-46-1. \nThis Court returned to the  issue  of indigent defense  services  in Jackson  v.  State,  732  So.  2d \n137  (Miss.  1999),  in  the  limited  context  of provision  of post-conviction  counsel  in  death  penalty \ncases.  The Court went  so far as to amend Miss.R.App.P.  22 to promulgate  a system for appointment \nand compensation of post-conviction counsel  under Jackson.  And  again,  the  Legislature  rose to  its \nshare  of the responsibility by enacting  legislation to provide  a full-time,  State-funded  office  to meet \npart of the Jackson  mandate.  Miss.  Code  Ann.  99-15-18  (Supp.  2001). \nThus the  substantive questions’  posed by Quitman County’s  lawsuit  are:  (1)  can the  county \nstate  a claim that it is  now necessary to the  independence  and effective operation of the  Mississippi \njudiciary that a change in funding for indigent defense representation be  ordered  by the courts? And \n(2)  can the  county  state  a claim that,  at a minimum, the  courts should enter an order which gives the \nlegislative  branch  an opportunity — and  a deadline — for using  its  discretion  to  improve  funding  for \n  \n‘Regarding the third  potential  question — that of the  county’s  standing  to  sue — the Bar notes \nthat, consistent with the arguments presented by the county in its brief, in  Wilson the defense lawyers \nhad  standing  to  raise  the  constitutional  separation-of-powers  issue  decided  in  that  case.  That  the \nsubdivision paying these lawyers has at least the same standing would seem to be dictated by  Wilson, \nif not  by principles  of subrogation. \nJO:99075719.1  3\n  \nindigent  defense  representation in Mississippi  Courts?  The  Bar  submits  that  these  questions must \nbe  answered  in the  affirmative. \nIn  the  years  after  Wilson  was  decided,  it  has  become  all  too  clear  that  this  Court’s \ninterpretation  of Miss.  Code  Ann.  §99-15-17  is  not  sufficient  to  ensure  the  delivery  of effective \ncounsel  to  indigent  defendants  and  thereby  promote  the  independence  and  effectiveness  of  the \ncriminal justice system  in our State.  In  1992 the  Mississippi Bar appointed a Criminal Justice  Task \nForce,  led  by  Chairman,  Justice  Fred  L.  Banks,  Jr.  of the  Mississippi  Supreme  Court,  and  Vice- \nChairman Circuit Judge  R.I.  Prichard II];  the Task Force  included prosecutors and defense  counsel. \nIn  November  1993,  the  Indigent  Defense  Subcommittee  of  the  Task  Force  engaged  The \nSpangenberg  Group  of West Newton,  Massachusetts  to  conduct a statewide  study  of Mississippi’s \nindigent  defense  system  and  provide  recommendations  on  how  to  improve  the  quality  of indigent \ndefense.  The  Spangenberg  Group  is  a  nationally  recognized  research  and  consulting  firm \nspecializing  in  the  study  of indigent  defense  services;  it has  been  engaged  in  studies  in  every  State \nin  the  Union  and  in  several  countries  overseas. \nThe Spangenberg Group’s first report was issued in January  1995.  The  Spangenberg Group, \nIndigent  Defense  In  Mississippi:  Final  Report  (January  1995).  As  the  Bar  expected,  the \nSpangenberg Groups  researchers  and  experts  found  that there  are  numerous dedicated  Mississippi \nlawyers  serving  as  counsel  for  the  indigent  accused.  1995  Report  at  52.  These  dedicated  lawyers \nwere  forced  to  struggle  with  the  demands of an  underfunded  and  overworked  system.  As  the  1995 \nReport  found: \n  \n*Cited  hereinafter  as  “2995  Report”  or  “Spangenberg Report  (1995).” \nJ0:99075719.1  4 \n \n°  Funding for indigent defense in  Mississippi  is totally inadequate.  “Mississippi is one  of \nonly  eight  states  in  the  country  that  does  not  provide  any  state  funds  for  indigent  defense \nservices  .  ..  By  every measure,  total  funds  for  indigent  defense  in  Mississippi  are  near the \nbottom  in  the  nation,  including  cost  per  capita  and  cost  per  case.”  1995  Report  at  51 \n(emphasis  added) \n°  The  lack of adequate  resources for indigent defense  services  in Mississippi  results  in  poor \nquality  services  and  representation.  “Every  aspect  of  defense  representation  is \ncompromised.  Specifically  there  is  very  little:  early  representation  provided, \ninvestigation conducted, attorney/client contact, or use of experts.  ... Case preparation \nis  often  late,  and  frequently preliminary hearings are waived and defendants  are  held  in jail \nthree  to  six  months  without  counsel  until  arraignment  in  circuit  court.”  fd.  at  31-52 \n(emphasis  added). \nThe  systemic  cause  of the  breakdown  in  delivery  of legal  representation  to  poor  persons \ncharged with crime was not hard to discern.  In the years after this Court’s  Wilson decision abrogated \n(de  facto,  though  not  de jure)  the  $1,000  per-case  cap  for  case-by-case  appointed  counsel,  61  of \nMississippi’s  82  counties had chosen to  appoint a “part-time public  defender” to  represent  indigent \ndefendants.  Spangenberg Report  (1995)  at  15-16  and  Table  3-1.  There  are,  however,  no  statutory \nguidelines  to  govern  the  appointment  of part-time  public  defenders.  /d@  at  18.  The  1995  Report \ndetails the  usual  arrangement  for  part-time  county  defenders: \nIn practice, counties contract with one or more part-time public defenders to do \nall  of the indigent  defense  work  in  the  county  for  a  fixed  annual  amount...  In \nsome counties, separate contracts are created for Youth Court, Justice Court, lunacies \nand/or  Circuit  Court.  In many  instances,  the  contracting  attorney  does  not  receive \nadditional funds for support staff, overhead costs, etc.  Thus, the contract attorneys \nagree  to  represent  an  unlimited  number  of  indigent  defendants,  regardless  of \nthe  complexity  of the  cases  and  without  guarantees  of full  reimbursement  for \nsupport  services,  for  a  year  based  upon  a  fixed  annual  fee. \nid.  at  19  (emphasis  added) \nWhile  a contract public defender handling all the  felony cases  in the  county may be relieved \nof  the  burdens  of  defending  in  Youth  Court,  lunacies,  or  Justice  Court,  he  or  she  is  still  far \n30:99075719.1  5\noutmatched by the resources available to the  State.  This  is because there  are “vast differences  in the \nresponsibilities  of prosecutors  and public  defenders.”  /d  at  39.  That  is  to  say: \nPublic  defenders,  whether they  are part-time or  full-time,  are  responsible  for felony \ncases  originating  in  the  lower  courts  at  initial  appearance,  and  on  through  any \nappeals.  In contrast, the county attorney’s involvement with a felony case ends after \nthe  preliminary  hearing  at  which  point  the  district  attorney  assumes  responsibility \nfrom  indictment  through  [trial]  disposition.  The  attorney  general  [defends]  all \nappeals  of  criminal  convictions.  Thus,  part-time  county  defenders  shoulder \nenormous  workloads  with  no  guarantees  of  adequate  resources  while  their \nprosecutorial counterparts are provided resources governed by legislation and funded \nby  both  county  and  state  revenues. \nId.  To be  sure, such an arrangement drives down costs, and may be the only financially viable option \nfor  counties  forced  to  provide  100%  of the  expense  for  indigent  defense  services.  And  this  is  no \ndoubt  the  reason  why  Mississippi  had  the  lowest  per  capita  expenditure  of  27  geographically \nproximate or demographically similar states surveyed in the Bar’s study.  /d.  at  35-36 and Table 3-4. \nBut  such  parsimony is  not  likely to  result  in  an  “independent,  effective” judicial  system. \nThe results  of the counties’  response to  Wilson  are detailed in the  1995  Spangenberg Report. \nThe  report,  which  was  based  on  comprehensive  written  and  in-person  interviews  throughout  the \nState,  discussed  the  effect  of  this  arrangement  on  the  quality  of  legal  services  provided  to \nimpoverished  defendants: \nWe  were  told  by  part-time  public  defenders  that  the  vast  majority  of their \nindigent clients accept pleas; very few go to trial.  The unrelenting assignment of new \ncases  combined with low compensation create  a disincentive for public  defenders to \ntake  cases  to  trial.  The  possibility  of an  appeal  is  also  something  a public  defender \nhas  to  consider:  there  is  no  extra  compensation  provided  for  appellate  cases.  This \nsituation  raises  grave  concerns  about the  quality  of representation  available  in \nmany  counties  for  indigent  defendants.  One  part-time  public  defender \nadmitted, “There is  not much  lawyering going on.  |  get them through the  system \nand  get  them  out  of here.” \nId.  at  26. \n30:99075719.1  6 \n \nTime  and again the part-time  public  defenders  interviewed  during the  Bar’s  study discussed \nthe negative impact of their excessive caseloads on the judicial  system as a whole.  The  1995  Report \nfound  that  “many  defendants  are  detained  without  assistance  in  a  bond  reduction  hearing  or  the \npreliminary hearing”  because  defense  attorneys  pressed  with  the  need  to  prepare  the  merits  of too \nmany  cases  had  no  time  to  devote  to  these  auxiliary  matters.  /d  at  28.  As  a  result,  “these \ndefendants  are  incarcerated  for four and  sometimes  five  months prior to  indictment, without \nany  attorney  contact.”  /d.  This,  in turn,  has a negative impact on other parts of the justice  system: \nJail  overcrowding  is  a problem  for some  of Mississippi’s counties,  and jail \npopulations  are  impacted by the timeliness of public defender appointments and the \nability of public defenders  to  first visit their incarcerated clients.  Overcrowding can \nincrease if public defenders are unable to meet with clients to arrange for the posting \nof bond or bond reductions.  One public defender told us that in his county, felony \ndefendants  routinely  remain  in  custody for three months before seeing a public \ndefender.  Another  part-time  public  defender  who  works  in  a  county  with  jail \novercrowding  avoids  seeking  continuances  for defendants  “willing to  do  time.” \nId.  at  28. \nThe  Spangenberg  Group  conducted  a  follow-up  study  for  the  Bar  and  submitted  a  further \nreport two  years  later.  The  Spangenberg  Group,  Update:  The State  of Indigent Defense  Services  in \nMississippi  (January  1997).>  The  1997  Report  found that: \nThe  problems  identified in the statewide report remain much the same today. \nAs  of Fall  1996,  only  three  of Mississippi’s  82  counties  provide  indigent  defense \nservices by means of full-time  public defender offices.  The majority of counties rely \non  poorly  funded  contract  public  defenders  to  represent  indigent  defendants. \nMississippi’s  counties  seldom  provide  these  part-time  public  defenders  with  office \nspace,  support  staff or  ready  access  to  investigators,  experts  or  expenses  necessary \nfor  litigation.  Contract  public  defenders  typically  work  on  fixed  price  contracts \nwhich  require  them  to  accept  an  unspecified  number  of cases  in  the  given  contract \nperiod. \n  \nCited  as  “1997 Report”  or “Spangenberg Report (1997).” \nJ0:99075719.1  7\n1997  Report  at  2. \nThe  last  of the three  Spangenberg  Group  Reports,  issued in  December  1998,  showed  a new \nand  disturbing  trend  —  despite  an increase  in  spending  of  16%  between  fiscal  year  1996  and  1998, \n“Mississippi's  cost  per  capita  in  FY  1998  remains  below  that  reported  by  any  of the  comparable \nstates for FY 1996.”  1998  Report  at  20. \nIn  response  to  the  first  of these  reports,  the  Criminal  Justice  Task  Force  proposed,  and  the \nBoard  of  Bar  Commissioners  adopted,  several  recommendations  for  the  improvement  of  the \nrepresentation  of poor persons  charged with crimes  in  Mississippi.  They  included: \n.  Establishment of a full-time public defender office for representation of indigents in criminal \ncases,  organized,  like  the  District Attorneys,  at  the  Circuit  Court  District  level; \n°  Funding  for  these  district  defender  offices  from  State  general  funds,  not  county  funds; \n.  Parity in the  level of funding and salaries to those provided to the District Attorneys’  Offices; \n°  Provision  of expert  and  investigative  services  where  necessary;  and \n°  A  full-time  office  of appellate  defenders, comparable to the  Criminal Litigation Division  of \nthe  Attorney  General’s  Office. \nWith  the  support  of  The  Mississippi  Bar,  the  1998  Legislature  passed  the  Mississippi \nStatewide  Public  Defender  Act,  a  statute  which  met  the  goals  established  by  the  Bar  and  its  Task \nForce.  This  statute,  however,  was  repealed  two  years  later.  At  the  current  time,  according  to  the \nRecord in this case to date, indigent defense representation in Quitman County suffers from the exact \nproblems  detailed  in  the  Bar’s  studies: \n.  Part-time  salaries  to  two  lawyers  (approximately  $16,200  per lawyer per  year,  ARE  1705) \nwith  the  expectation  that  the  lawyers  will  handle  all  non-conflict  criminal  defense  cases  in \nthe  county; \n°  No  meeting  between  lawyer and client  until  indictment  and  arraignment  (ARE  1705); \nJO:99075719.1  8 \n \n.  Little or no background investigation of witnesses called by the  State at trial (ARE  1716-17); \n.  Little  or  no  use  of  investigators  or  experts  in  non-capital  cases  (ARE  1715-16,  1738-40; \n1580-81);  | \n.  Use of the lawyer’s personal funds to hire investigators or experts in non-capital cases (ARE \n1726). \n.  Failure  of communication between  the  lawyer  and the  client  (ARE  1733). \nAnd  as the  Bar’s  studies  showed,  the problem  is not  with the men and  women who  practice \nlaw  in  locales  such  as  Quitman  County.  The  Quitman  County  defenders  testified  that,  with  more \nfunds  and  lower  caseloads,  they  would  have  been  pleased  to  devote  more  time  and  energy  to \nindividual  cases.  ARE  1725-27.  Rather,  the  problem  is  with  a  long-broken  mechanism  for \nproviding  legal  representation  to  poor  persons  charged  with  felony  offenses.  This  Court  already \ndecided in  Wilson that the judiciary has the power -- and the duty — to  fix this mechanism.  By virtue \nof this  litigation,  facts  can  be  explored  to  the  end  of proposing  a  true  solution  to  the  problem  that \nevaded  Wilson’s  prescription. \nCONCLUSION \nAt this juncture,  this  Court need not decide on whether the Legislature  has failed to  meet  its \nConstitutional  mandate  to  provide  an  independent  and  effective  judiciary.  Nor  need  this  Court \ndecide  what  form  any  relief might  take  --  indeed,  ultimately  the  relief granted  might  be,  as  in  so \nmany  of the  Court’s  separation-of-powers  cases,  a  prospective  one,  with  additional  time  for  the \nLegislature  to  craft a solution to this problem.  So  does  the  Record  support a claim  for  relief under \nWilson’s  standard?  Because  the  Bar  believes  that  the  current  system  for  providing  counsel  to \nindigents charged  with crime  is woefully inadequate  to do justice, the conclusion 1s  equally  simple: \nJ0:99075719.1  9\nit  is  now absolutely  necessary — more  than ever — to  give  the  Bar’s  Members  the  tools  they  need  to \ndo  their jobs  when  asked  to  represent  indigent  defendants. \nRespectfully  Submitted, \nTHE  MISSISSIPPI  BAR,  et  al. \n   \npf  | \n   \nUBEN  V.ANDERSON  (MSB  #  1587) \nJAMES  W.

But achieving\nindividual just outcomes demands attention to a systemic question- is the system of indigent\n,I.\ndefense providing a constitutionally adequate defense to each client? This is a difficult question,\nI\nbut not one for which there is no guidance. Nationally recognized standards and guidelines were\nI developed so that a system that meets these standards comes as close as possible to guaranteeing\nthat each defendant will be provided with an adequate defense. However, the question raised by\nI\nthis case is slightly different and is an easier one to answer: how can we tell if the system of\nI\nindigent defense in Quitman County is not providing a constitutionally adequate defense to\nclients? Here, too, national standards are essential. A system of indigent defense, like the one in\nl\nplace in Quitman County, that utterly tails to measure up to national standards and principles is\nI\nin fact delivering a constitutionally inadequate defense to some accused persons. Mississippi has\nfailed to ensure that the system of indigent defense in Quitman County is equipped to provide\nI\neach defendant with the tools of an adequate defense. As such, Mississippi has failed to meet its\nI\nconstitutional obligation to provide counsel to the indigent accused, and this Court must step in\nto protect the rights of the individt.als whose lives and liberties are at stake.\nI\n1. THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI HAS A DUTY TO PROVIDE THE INDIGENT\nACCUSED WITH THE TOOLS OF AN ADEQUATE DEFENSE.\nI\nThe Mississippi Constitution, AJticle 3, § 26, has been interpreted to create a duty on the\nI\npart of the state to provide effective assistance of counsel to indigent defendants. State v.\nQuilman CounO' , 807 So. 2d 401,407 (Miss. 2001), reh _, denied (2002). The Mississippi\nI\nSupreme Court has recognized that this means that indigent defendants must be provided with\nI I\n\nthe tools of an adequate defense. Harrison v. State, 635 So. 2d 894, 901 (Miss. 1994) (citilLgAke\nl\nv. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 77 (1985)). The Court has also noted that the \"tools\" that are\nI necessary to construct an adequate defense vary depending on the thcts and circumstances of\neach case. Harrison, 635 So. 2d at 901 (citing Oregon v. Acosta, 597 P.2d 1282, 1284 (Or.\nI\n1979)).\nI The trial court found that Quitman County has not demonstrated ineffective assistance of\ncounsel in individual cases. Trial Ct. Op. at ¶ 72. Quitman County, however, has raised a\n!\nsystemic challenge to the current system tbr delivery of indigent defense services, a challenge\nthat raises qualitatively different questions and demands a different type of analysis than an\n,|,\nindividual ineffective assistance of counsel claim. As it is impossible to determine in advance\nI\nwhat tools will be necessary in a specific case, fundamental fairness and the Constitution demand\n! that the system of indigent defense stands ready to provide the accused individual with the\nmaterials needed to put tbrth a defense tailored to the facts and circumstances of his case. The\nI\nMississippi Supreme Court, quoting the United States Supreme Court, acknowledged:\nI We recognized long ago that mere access to the courthouse doors does not by\nitself assure a proper functioning of the adversary process, and that a criminal trial\nis fundamentally unfair if the State proceeds against an indigent defendant without\nI making certain that he has access to the raw inaterials integral to the building of\nan effective defense.\nI Harrison, 635 So. 2d at 901 (quolmgAke, 470 U.S. at 77). Theretbre, in the context of Quitman\nCounty's systemic challenge, this Court nmst examine the system as a whole, including its\nI\nstructure and funding, and determine whether the system is equipped to consistently provide\nI\nindigent defendants with the tools necessary to an adequate defense.\nII. NATIONAL STANDARDS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ADDRESSING QUITMAN\nI\nCOUNTY'S SYSTEMIC CHALLENGE, AS TItEY ARE DESIGNED TO\nENSURE THAT A SYSTEM IS EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE THE TOOLS OF AN\nADEQUATE DEFENSE.\nI\nI\n\n!\n!\nNational standards are integral to a determination of whether a system of indigent defense\nI\nprovides the tools of an adequate defense. The Final Report of the National Symposium on\nI Indigent Defense in 2000, convened by the U.S. Department of Justice, highlighted the vital role\nthat national standards play: \"Tile constitutional right to effective representation joins with the\nI\nguarantee of equal justice to compel tile nationwide implementation of indigent defense\nI standards.\" Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, Red_fmingLeadershil)for\nEqual .hlstice: Final Report qf National Symposium on Indigent Defense 2000, at 14, m,ailable\n!\nat: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/indigentdefense/symposit, nl.pdt: Standards and guidelines for\nI, indigent defense systems were developed by the National Legal Aid & Defender Association\n(\"NLADA\"), tile American Bar Association (\"ABA\"), and other nationally recognized\nI\norganizations as a way of ensuring that all indigent defendants are provided with a\ni constitutionally adequate defense. Although the concept of using standards to address qt.ality\nconcerns is not unique to the field of indigent defense, it is particularly important where the\nI\nquality of services provided is directly related to a constitutional obligation on the part of the\nI state.\nIn a systemic challenge like the one raised by Quitman County, national standards are\n.I\nessential for gauging whether tile system is equipped to provide each indigent client with the raw\nI\nmaterials of an effective defense. As the trial court recognized, \"The question is not.., whether in\nisolated cases the ptiblic defenders were ineffective. Rather, the question is whether Mississippi's\nI\ncounty-based systeln is a constitutionally adequate system of indigent defense.\" Trial Ct. Op. at\nI\n¶ 84. Keeping this distinction in mind, NLADA does not here put tbrth the standards-based\nargument that has been raised by individuals in the context of ineffective assistance of counsel\n!\nclaims - that an indigent defense system that fails to measure up to national standards mea,ls that\nI\nindividual convictions must be overturned on appeal. See. e.g. State v. ,_'ctlaz_tl', 844 P.2d 566,\nI\n\nI\n!\n581-582 (Axiz. 1992); Folztv. State, 784 P.2d 951,953 (Nev. 1989). Rather. NLADA urges this\nI\nCourt to consider the relevant national standards in its determination of whether the Mississippi\nsystem as a whole is constitutionally defective.\nI\nA. NLADA Standards\n!\nFor over twenty-five years, NLADA has played a key role in developing standards for\ni systems of indigent defense. In 1976, the National Study Commission oll Defense Services, a\ngroup convened by NLADA, published Guidelines for Legal Defense ,_),stems in the United\n!\nStates (\"NSC Guidelines\") after two years of consultation and study. NSC Guidelines detail how\nI a system of indigent defense should be structured and managed to best provide services to\nindigent clients: NLADA continues to play a leadership role in both the development of national\n!\nstandards for public defense systems _and processes for evaluating jurisdictions' compliance\n! with the constitutional right to counsel.\nOf particular relevance in this case is NLADA's experience in developing guidelines to\nI\naddress the concerns that arise injt,risdictions that provide counsel to indigent defendants\nI through contracts with private attorneys. NLADA, Guidelines for Negotiatit_g, and Awarding\nGovernmental Contracts for Criminal Defense Services (1984). (\"Contracting Guidelines\"). The\nI\n]Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems in the United States (National Study Commission (\"NSC\") on\nI\nDefense Services, U.S. Department of Justice, 1976); The Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery\nSystem (adopted by the ABA, 2002): St,'mdards for the Appohltment and Performance of Cotmsel m\nDeath Penalty Cases (NLADA, 1988: ABA, 1989), Defender Training and Development Stmldards\nI\n(NLADA, 1997); Perform,'mce Guidelines for Criminal Defense Representation (NLADA, 1995);\nGuidelines for Negotiating and Awarding Contracts for Crinunal Defense Services (NLADA, 1984;\nABA, 1985); Standards for the Administration of Assigned Counsel Systems (NLADA, 1989); Standards\nI and Evaluation Design for Appellate Defender Offices (NLADA, 1980); Evaluation Design for Public\nDefender Offices (NLADA, 1977); and Indigent Defense Caseloads and Common Sense: An Update\n(NLADA, 1994). All standards are available at:\nI http://wwwnlada°rg/Defender/Defender-Standards/Defender-Standards H°me Such standards were\ngathered into the first-ever National Coll_pendium of Standards for hldigent Defense Systems by the U.S.\nDepartmel}t of Justice, with NLADA assistance, in 200(t Available at\nI http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/indigentdefellse/conlpendium/.\nI\n\nI\n!\nContracting Guidelines are \"designed to provide assurance that minimum constitutional\nI\nrequirements are met when local governments choose to serve poor clients through a contract\nI defense system.\" Id.\nA number of courts throughout the country have looked to national standards in assessing\nI\neffectiveness of counsel and deterlnining the meaning of statutes implementing the constitutional\nI guarantee of right to counsel. Earl v. Tulsa Court O,Dist. Court, 606 P.2d 545, 547 n.7 (Okla.\n1979): Commom_,eallh v. Brown. 476 A.2d 381,386 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984,); State v. Smith, 140\nI\nAriz 681 P.2d 1374, 1379-1382 (Ariz. 1984). For example, in interpreting a statute providing\nfor public defender salaries that are \"commensurate\" with that of prosecutors, the Supreme Court\n.\nof Oklahoma noted that its construction of the statute harmonized with American Bar\nI\nAssociation, NLADA, and other national standards. Earl, 606 P.2d at 547, n.7. The Superior\nI Cou,_ of Pennsylvania has cited to NLADA and other standards in considering a defendant's\nchallenge to a finding of ineligibility for a public defender. Brown. 476 A2d at 386.\nI\nFurthermore, in Stale v. Smith, the Arizona Supreme Court undertook an analysis of one county's\nI\ncontract defense system, and compared it to NLADA's Contracting Guidelines and relevant\nABA standards. 681 P.2d at 1379-1382. The court found that the county's system did not\nI\nconform to standards, and that as a result, indigent defendants were not being provided with\nI\nadequate assistance of counsel. The Court established a rebuttable presumption of inadequate\nrepresentation, z Id.\nI\n_\"\"We do not believe the Mohave County system is in conformance with these standards and guidelines\nI\nfor fbnr reasons:\n1. The system does not take into account the time that file attorney is expected to spend in representing his\nshare of indigent defendants.\nI\n2. The system does not provide for support costs for the attomcy, such as investigators, paralegals, and\nlaw clerks.\n3. The system tails to take into account the competency of the attorney. An attorney, especially one\nI newly-admitted to the bar, for example, could bid low in order to obtain a contract, but would not be able\nto adequately represent all of the clients assigned according to the standard of Watson, supra.\n4. The systcln does not take into account the COlnplexity of each case.\nI 5\n\nI\nI\nThe United States Supreme Court has also recognized, most recently in Wiggins v. Smith,\n!\nthat national standards are \"well-defined norms\" that should serve as guideposts for assessing\nI ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003) (\"Counsel's conduct similarly\nfell short of the standards for capital defense work articulated by tile American Bar Association\nI\n(ABA) -- standards to which we long have referred as 'guides to determining what is\nI reasonable.'\") Moreover, in addressing a wide assortment of individual and systemic challenges\nto services provided to indigent defendants, Courts have found it useful and appropriate to\n!\nconsult national standards in grappling with the difficulties of ensuring that an accused\nI individual is provided with a fair and adequate defense.

ABA's Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System\nI\nThe ABA has also been active in developing guidelines and standards for criminal\nI\ndefense representation in general, and tbr public defense systems specifically. Most recently, the\nABA has adopted The Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery 5'ystem (\"Ten Principles\"),\nI\n(2002) in an effort to distill ABA, NLADA, and other national standards into tile most essential\nI\nelements of an indigent defense delivery system _The Ten Principles \"constitute the fundamental\nI\nWe believe that the system for obtaining indigent defense counsel in Mohave County militates against\nadequate assistance of counsel _br indigent defendants. Even though in the instant case we do not find\ninadequate representation, so long as the County of Mohave fails to take into account the items listed\nI\nabove, there will be an inference that the adequacy of representation is adversely affected by the system.\"\nStarer. Smith, 681 P.2d 1374, 1381 (Ariz. 1984).\nI _The full text of the Ten Principles are attached hereto as Appendix A. The Ten Principles are based on a\npaper entitled The Ten Commandments c!/Public Defense Deliver_, ._vstems. which was written by James\nR Neuhard, Director of the Michigan Sate Appellate Defender Office, and Scott Wallace, former Director\nI of Det'_nder Legal Services for NLADA The paper w,'_spublished ,asaq introduction to Cmnpendmm c!/\"\nStandards.for hTdige_zt DtJensc ,_,_.,stcms.A Rcsmlrce Guide f_r Practitioners and Policvmakers (Office of\nJustice Programs/Bureau of Justice Assistance, U.S. Department of Justice. 2001 ).\nI\n\nI\nI\ncriteria to be met for a public defense delivery system to deliver effective and efficient, high\nI\nquality, ethical, conflict-free representation to accused persons who cannot afford to hire an\nI attorney.\" Report to the House q.f Delegates, Introduction (2002), at http://_vw.abanet.org/\nlegalservices/downloads/sclaid/10principles.pdf. As a distillation of nationally recognized\nl\nstandards into their most fundamental and crucial elements, the ABA's Ten Principles are\nI particularly useful as benchmarks for measuring the success or failure of systems of public\ndefense. NLADA regards the Ten Principles as the absolutely essential characteristics that a\nsystem must possess in order to safeguard the rights of the indigent accused.\ni\nI Since the ABA adopted the Ten Principles in 2002, states tllat are in the process of\nreforming their indigent defe,lse systems are increasingly looking to tile Ten Principles for\nI\nguidance. In 2002, the Georgia Supreme Court Commission on lndigent Defense issued a report\nI calling for state-sponsored indigent defense and establishment of basic standards, in which it\nembraced the ABA's Ten Principles. Georgia enacted legisla-tion in May 2003 incorporating\nI. most of the Commission's recommendations. 7he Ten Principles'Role in State Re/brm E_)rts,\nI\nat http ://w_v.abanet._rg/_ega_services/d_wn_ads/sc_aid/indigentdefense/ __princip_es-\nstaterel'orm.pdf The Ten Principles have also been adopted by the Michigan State Bar, Id., and\nI\nhave been instrumental in assessing and working towards improvement of indigent defense\n!\nsystems in Louisiana and Virginia. See Appendices B and C.\nHI. QUITMAN COUNTY'S SYSTEM OF INDIGENT DEFENSE WI]OLLY FAILS\nl\nTO MEASURE UP TO NATIONAL STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES.\nThe system of indigent defense in Quitman county does not measure up to national\nI\nstandards. Not only does it fail to meet the detailed guidelines established by NLADA and the\nI\nABA, but Quitman County's public defense system violates the basic institutional safeguards, as\nreflected in the Ten Principles, that enable a system of public defense to consistently provide the\nI\nI\n\n!\n!\ntools of an adequate defense in each case. The most egregious and systematic failures are\n!\ndiscussed in more detail below. 4\nI A. Independence\nThe legitimacy and fairness of the adversarial system depends crucially upon the\nI\nindependence of each of the parties. According to ABA Principle One, \"The public defense\nl function, including the selection, funding, and payment of defense counsel, is independent. The\npublic defense function should be independent from political influence and subject to judicial\nl\nsupervision only in the same manner and to the same extent as retained counsel.\"\nI In Quitman County, however, the public defenders are far from independent. They are\nappointed by the senior circuit judge, and can be terminated by him as well.Trial Ct. Op. at ¶ 9,\nI\n12. Such an arrangement is simply unacceptable in an adversarial system - as the National Study\nI Commission on Defense Services concluded in 1976, \"The mediator between two adversaries\ncannot be permitted to make policy for one of the adversaries.\" NSC Report at 220 (citing\nI\nNational Advise O, Commission on O'iminal .h_stice Standards and Goals (19731), commentary to\nI\nStandard 13.9.).\nNeither is the public defense function independent from law enforcement, as sheriff's\nI\ndeputies often help the public defenders locate witnesses for their cases. Trial Ct. Op. at ¶ 29.\nI\nThe high rate of arraignment day guilty pleas -_is also an indication that Quitman County public\ndefenders do not unde.-take an independent investigation of the facts. While the trial judge noted\ni\nthat the practice of pleading clients out on arraignment day after only a brief meeting is \"not an\nI\n4Nothing in this brief should be taken to ,neml that NLADA believes Quitman County or Mississippi is\ncomplying with any of the Ten Principles or NLADA guidelines that are not discussed here.. NLADA has\nlimited its discl.ssion to the violations of principles and standards that are most apparent in the record,\nI\nparticularly in the Trial Court's Opinion, mid that go to the heart of Quitman County's systemic challenge\nto the indigent defense structure in Mississippi. For the fifll text of the ABA's \"The Ten Principles of a\nPublic Def'cnse Delivery System,\" see Appendix A. Appendices B and C provide examples of how the\nI Ten Principles can be ust;d as a practical guide for assessing a system of indigent defense.\n5Approximately one-half of all guilty pleas from 1995-2003 involving indigent defendants were entered\nthe same day as the arraignment. Trial Ct. Op. at _[31.\nI 8\n\nI\ni\nideal situation,\" Trial Ct. Op. at ¶ 77, it is much less than not ideal. At a mininaum, effective\nI\nrepresentation requires that counsel interview potential witnesses and make an independent\ninvestigation of the facts and circumstances of each case. Payton v. State, 708 So. 2d 559, 561\nI\n(Miss. 1998); State v. Tokman, 564 So. 2d 1339, 1342 (Miss. 1990) (internal quotation marks\nI\nand citations omitted). Independent investigation is surely not the hallmark of a system in which\nhalf of all guilty pleas by indigent defendants take place on arraignment day.\nI\nCentral to the need lbr independence of the public defense function is tile need for it to be\nI\nconflict-tree. In the context of a contract system like Quitman County's, \"the concern focuses\nl primarily on fiat-fee contracts which pay a single lump sum for a block of cases regardless of\nhow much work the attorney does, creatit(_, a direct financial co_!/lict qf interest with the client,\nI\nin the sense that work or services beyond the bare minimum effectively reduces the attorney's\nI take-home compensation.\" Scott Wallace & David Carroll, The hnplementation andhnpact of\nfltdigent Defense Standardx 8 (2002). (emphasis added). For this reason, NLADA Contracting\ni\nGuidelines prohibit this type of flat-tee arrangement, requiring that tile contract compensate\nI attorneys at a rate reflecting the time and labor required to be spent by the attorney. Contracting\nGuidelines III-10. Equally troubling is tile fact that Quitman County public defenders maintain a\nI\nprivate law practice, Trial Ct. Op. ¶ 9, 12, creating a further conflict of interest and a financial\nI disincentive to spend time on tile cases of indigent defendants. _\nTile record indicates that tile system of indigent defense in place in Quitman County is\ni\nnot independent in any meaningful way. Public defenders are dependent on judges tbr their jobs.\nI\nIn too many cases, they undertake no independent investigation of the facts and circumstances.\nTile flat-fee contract arrangement that is in place builds in financial conflicts of interest between\nI\nattorney and client. Without contbrmity to national standards designed to ensure tile\nI\n6NSC Guideline 2.9 states that \"staffattornevs should be fid[-time employecs, prohibited from engaging\nin the private practice of law.\"\nI\n\nl\nI\nindependence of the public defender function, the Quitman County system of indigent defense is\nI\nnot equipped to deliver appropriate conflict-free representation to the indigent accused.\nB. Caseload\nI\nThe centerpiece of any effective public defense system is control over the workload of\nI\nthe attorneys. A system that limits the number and type of cases a defender carries at one time\npaves the way tbr public defenders to be able to give an appropriate amount of time and attention\nI\nto each accused individual. ABA Principle Five reflects this most basic of concerns: \"Defense\nl\ncounsel's workload is controlled to permit the rendering of quality representation,\" and provides\nthat \"national caseload standards should in no event be exceeded. ''7\nI\n1,1violation of this critical precept, Quitman County public defenders are not subject to\nI\nany lilnitations on the number of accused persons they are permitted to represent. Rather, for a\nI fiat fee, they represent all indigent defendants in Quitman County, and maintain the same\narrangements with other counties as well. Trial Ct. Op. at ¶ 9-11. In addition, Quitman public\nI\ndefenders handle justice court appointments, are required to handle appeals, and are permitted to\ni maintain their private law practices. Trial Ct. Op. at ¶ 9-1 I. Quitman County asserts that public\ndefenders Shackleford and Tisdell handle 164 and 169 felony cases respectively. \"_PX 48. Both\nI\nof these caseloads exceed the maximum allowable cases under the standards, h_!fore taking into\nI consideration the number of cases handled in private practice, in justice court, and in the appeals\nphase. RE 18 (Tr. 758). In rejecting Quitman County's contention that these caseloads are\nI\n7National Advisory Commission Standard 13.12 (National Advisor' Commission on Criminal Justice\nStandards and Goals, Standard_'fi_r the Dqfi,nse, Chapter 13, (1973)) specifics thc numerical caseload\nI limits (lnaximum yearly caseload: 150 felonies, 400 misdemeanors, 200 juvenile, 21)0mental health, or\n25 appeals) that have been incorporated into the Ten Principles, as well as into NSC Guidelines ,and\nContracting Guidelines. (NSC Guideline 5.1; Contracting Guidelines III-6.) Both NSC and Contracting\nI Guidclmes call tbr the establishment of maximum allowable caseloads, ht.\nsEven assuming, arguendo, that Quimmn County public defenders handle fewer cases than the numerical\nlimits set forth in the standards, these caseload limits are designed for public dcfcndcrs who have the\nI suppoi_ of investigators and other stall'. Contracting Guidelines 111-8,111-9. It tbllows that the Quitman\ndefcnders, who do not have the benefit of these support personnel, can eft'cctivclv work on fewer cases\nthan the nlaxinll.lnl UuUlber.\nI 10\n\nI\ni\nexcessive, tile trial court ignored national standards and relied primarily on testimony that \"the\nl\ndefenders did not feel overburdened with their caseload.\" Trial Ct. Op. at ¶ 73.\nI C. Sufficient Time and Confidential Space to Meet with Client\nAs any lawyer knows, confidential communications about the case are the cornerstone of\nI\nan effective and ethical representation ABA Principle Four captures this crucial element of\nI effective representation: \"'Defense counsel is provided sufficient time and a confidential space\nwithin which to meet with the client .... Counsel should have confidential access to the client for\nl\ntile fiAI exchange of legal,, procedural and factual information between counsel and client. ''9 This\nI basic principle stands in stark contrast to the reality in Quitman County, where public defenders\noften meet with clients in groups in the courtroom or ill the jury room. Trial Ct. Op. at '[]28. The\nI\ntrial court did not address the systemic question raised by the finding that this happens \"often\" -\nI whether a system that operates in this manner is complying with the Mississippi Constitutional\nmandate to provide effective assistance of counsel to every indigent person accused of a crime.\nI\nThe answer is that it is not - the Mississippi Supreme Court has recognized that meaningful\ni\ndiscussions regarding the realities of a case are the \"cornerstones of effective assistance of\ncounsel.\" State v. Tc)hwlan, 564 So.2d 1339, 1343 _'liss. 1990) (citing Gaines v. Hopper, 575\nI\nF.2d 1147, 1150 (5tl'Cir. 1978)). Brief, group conversations are not \"meaningful\" in any sense of\nI the word.\nD. Oversight\nI\nABA Principles One, Two and Ten address the need for supervision and oversight of\nI\nthose responsible tbr delivering indigent defense services._° It is axiomatic that taxpayer-paid\ncontractors serving as guarantors of the fundamental constitutional right to counsel should be\nI\nI _See also. NSC Guideline 5.10: NLADA Performance Guidelines for Criminal Dcfensc Representation\n2.1-4.1 (1995).\ni_See also NSC Guidelines 2.4, 2.10-2.13, 5.4-5.5: Contracting Guidelines 11-1.11-3,111-16-\nI 11\n\n!\nI\nclosely overseen by those in a position to ensure the adequacy of their performance and the\nI\nintegrity of the justice system. Yet in Quitman County and other counties in Mississippi, there is\nI no significant oversight of public defense services. (Tr. 251,252, 592, 752). Instead, Mississippi\nallows county boards of supervisors to organize systems of public defense in the manner they\nI\ndetermine is best, Trial Ct. Op. at ¶ 17, and there is no statewide structure to ensure uniform\ni quality or constitutionally adequate services. RE 4 (Tr. 591-2).\nE. State Funding\nl\nThe Ten Principles and NLADA Standards call for state funding for every system of\"\nI indigent defense. Principle Two (\"Since the responsibility to provide defense services rests with\nthe state, there should be state fimding and a statewide structure responsible for ensuring tmiform\ni\nquality statewide.\"); NSC Guidelines 2.17 (\"The primary responsibility for funding of defense\nI services should be borne at the state level. Each state should provide adequate funding tbr all\ndefense services within its jurisdiction regardless of the level of government at which those\nI\nservices are ad,ninistered.\") Because a weakened local economy causes increases in\ni\nunemployment, worker flight, demands for other county services, and crime, local funding tends\nto constrict in inverse proportion to the demand for indigent defense services, producing\nII\ninstability in timding and wide fluctuations in the quality of indigent defense. State funding is\nI\nincluded as one of the Ten Principles not because it is a goal in itself, but because of the\nnecessity of a stable, broad-based funding source to the provision of constitutionally adequate\nI\nindigent defense services. A system like Quitman County's, that is subject to the vagaries of a\nI\ncounty goverument's economy and politics, is not well-equipped to consistently provide the raw\nlnaterials of an adequate defense to defendants. Therefore, by failing to provide state funding in\nI\nnon-capital cases, the state of Mississippi has failed to meet its constitutional burden of\nI\np,oviding counsel for accused persons who cannot afford a lawyer.\nI 12\n\nI\nI\nIV. A SYSTEM OF I_DIGENT DEFENSE THAT SO UTTERLY FAILS TO\nMEASURE UP TO NATIONAL STANDARDS CANNOT BE DELIVERING\nI\nCONSTITUTIONALLY ADEQUATE SERVICES TO ALL INDIGENT\nDEFENDANTS.\nI\nThe failure on tim part of Quitman County public defenders to comply with national\nstandards in one particular area might not seem that significant. What is significant is that the\nI\npublic defense system in Quitman County fails across the board to safeguard the most\nI\nfundamental protections necessary fbr the equitable administration of justice. Mississippi has\nl neglected to ensure that public defender systems in the counties are able to operate\nindependently, that workloads are controlled, that there is appropriate oversight, and that\nI\ndefendants are allowed confidential access to an attorney who will investigate the facts of each\nl case. Tl_e flaws apparent in the Quitman County system are not unique; rather, they are ti_e result\nof the fundamental problems inherent in a part-time, county-based system that lacks state\nI\nfunding and supervision. In essence, tim state of Mississippi has failed to establish o, fund a\nI system of indigent defense that is equipped to provide all defendants with the tools of an\nadequate defense, and has therefore fallen short of its constitutional obligation to provide counsel\nI\nto indigent defendants in Quitman County.\nI The trial court erred in failing to consider or address the testimony and evidence on\nnational standards and the impact that Mississippi's failure to live up to these standards has on\nI\nQuitman County's systemic challenge. NLADA and ABA standards and principles were\nI developed as a means of facilitating tim provision of a constitutionally adequate defense to each\nindigent accused. A system that reflects the essential tenets embodied in the Ten Principles is a\nI\nsystem that minimizes tl_e risk that innocent people will be convicted and that guilty people will\nI\nevade prosecution and punislament. National standards and principles should not be considered\naspirational. They should be regarded as an effective way of implementing the constitutional\nI\nguarantee of right to counsel.\nI 13\n\nI\nI\nIt is NLADA's position, based not on speculation, but on years of developing standards\nl\nand researching systems of indigent defense in various states, that a system of indigent defense\nl that so wholly fails to measure up to recognized standards and principles is in tact delivering\nconstitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel to some indigent persons accused of\nI\nwrongdoing The state would have the Mississippi Supreme Court sit idly by, knowing that\nindividual defendants are certain to receive ineffective assistance of counsel under the current\nI\nsystem. We submit that the Supreme Court need not wait for individuals to be deprived of\nI\nconstitutional rights in order to provide a remedy. Rather, this Court can and should act to ensure\nI that the indigent defendants prosecuted by the state of Mississippi are provided with the\nconstitutionally required tools of an adequate defense. In so doing, the Court will safeguard not\nI\nonly the rights of individuals, but the integrity of the justice system of Mississippi.\nI CONCLUSION\nNLADA respectfully requests that the Court grant the relief requested by Quitman\nI\nCounty, with a specific instruction to the legislature to assure that standards are incorporated into\nI\nany change in law enacted pursuant to this Court's opinion.\nRESPECTFLILLY SUBMITTED, this the'_\"b\"t_ldav of July, 2004.\nI\nNATIONAL LEGAL AID & DEFENDER ASSOCIATION\nI\nI\nJu_ Epps\nMS Bar # 5234\n504 E.

The public defense function including the selection, funding and payment of defense counsel is\nindependent.\nI There are two parts to Virginia's public defense delivery system. 1) Public Defender offices serve about half of Virginia's\npopulation in 21 locations and 2) a court appointed system (using private attorneys) serves the remainder of the state.\nCourt appointed attorneys depend on local judges to appoint them and approve their fees. The appointment system\ncompromises independence and gives the appearance that a lawyer's zealous advocacy on behalf of a client could result in\na private lawyer's removal from the court appointed list. Public defender offices are managed by the Virginia Public\nI\nDefender Commission, an independent state agency within the judicial branch. The commission sets policy for the hiring of\nall public defenders, including those involved in capital cases. Grade: D\n2. Where the caseload is sufficiently high, the public defense delivery system consists of both a defender\nI\noffice and the active participation of the private bar.\nThis principle requires the establishment of a statewide system for ensuring uniform quality. Virginia has no such structure.\nIn Public Defender jurisdictions there is a full-time administrator, but in court appointed jurisdictions administration is left\nup to localities. A full-time statewide administrator covering all indigent defense would improve the system and help\nI ensure uniform quality. Grade: D\n3. Clients are screened for eligibility, and defense counsel is assigned and notified of appointment, as soon as\nfeasible after client's arrest, detention, or request for counsel.\nI [n Virginia, the court appoints a lawyer during the defendant's initial court appearance after arrest, but the client may not\nbe able to meet with his lawyer until after the hearing. An improved system would allow for appointment of a lawyer and\nattorney-client contact before the initial hearing. Grade: B\nI 4. Defense counsel is provided sufficient time and a confidential space within which to meet with the client.\nVirginia's high caseloads and low fee caps may discourage court-appointed lawyers from spending sufficient time with\nclients to prepare their cases. Similarly, in many public defender offices, high caseloads prevent lawyers from spending\nsufficient time with clients to prepare cases. In some Virginia jails and courthouses, there is no private place for lawyers to\nI meet with their clients. Grade: D\n5. Defense counsel's workload is controlled to permit the rendering of quality representation.\nIn 1990, the Virginia Department of Planning and Budget approved statewide caseload standards for Public Defender\nI offices. Pubbc defender caseloads remain unreasonably high because the Virginia General Assembly has never funded\nenough staff to meet those standards. For many court appointed lawyers, caseloads are similarly high, hampering their\nability to provide quality representation. To improve under this principle, Virginia should implement a statewide plan for\nmanaging caseloads. Grade: D\nI\n6. Defense counsel's ability, training, and experience match the complexity of the case.\nThe Public Defender within each office is responsible for ensuring that the assistant pubbc defender assigned to the case\nhas the necessary ability, training and experience. However, because of high caseloads, sometimes attorneys lack\nsufficient training and experience for particular cases. Court appointed lawyers are appointed by individual trial judges who\nI\nare responsible for ensuring that they assign lawyers who are qualified to handle the charges. However, often there is no\nattempt to match a case with a qualified lawyer. Grade: C\nI 7. The same attorney continuously represents the client until completion of the case.\nMost public defender offices assign a single attorney from intake through disposition. In some offices, special appellate\nattorneys take all cases on appeal. Virginia's Supreme Court requires all court appointed lawyers and public defenders to\nrepresent a defendant through completion of the case. Grade: A\nI\n22\n\nI\nI\n8. There is purity between defense counsel and the prosecution with respect to resources and defense counsel\nis included as an equal partner in the justice system.\nI There is no parity of resources in Virginia. Virginia's current maximum hourly rate for court appointed counsel ($90/hour)\nis subject to the lowest unwaivable salary cap in the country. For example, in a complicated case involving three or more\nappearances in a District Court, a court appointed lawyer would receive a maximum of $112 (or 1.25 hours of pay} for\nrepresenting the client. Unlike prosecutors, neither Public Defenders nor court appointed lawyers have access to expert\nI assistance, except by demonstration of need, which is made in open court. Public defender salaries are set by the state to\nbe comparable to Commonwealth's Attorneys' state salaries, but unlike Commonwealth's Attorneys, there is no flexibility\nas to hiring level, no local salary supplements, no Career Defender Program, and no law school loan forgiveness. Grade: F\nI 9. Defense counsel is provided with and required to attend continuing legal education.\nPublic defender offices provide their lawyers with the minimum general training to meet state-mandated attorney\ncontinuing legal education (CLE) requirements of 12 hours per year, including two hours of ethics. Most training is in\ncriminal defense. Court appointed lawyers must pay for their continuing legal education and are required only to complete\nstate-mandated general training. There is no requirement for court appointed lawyers to undergo criminal defense training.\nI Grade'. C\n10. Defense counsel is supervised and systematically reviewed for quality and efficiency according to\nnationally and locally adopted standards.\nI Public defenders receive yearly performance evaluations based on statewide standards provided by the Public Defender\nCommission. Virginia's evaluation criteria do not encompass nationally recognized standards. Court appointed lawyers are\nnot required to meet any statewide qualifications or standards, nor istheir performance evaluated. Attorneys who wish to\nrepresent defendants in capital cases must meet minimum statewide standards set by the Virginia Public Defender\nI Commission, the Virginia State Bar, and the Supreme Court of Virginia.

In breach of its duty, the State improperly and unfairly has shifted the State's \nobligation to provide and pay for representation of indigent defendants to the counties of \nMississippi. \n3.  Although the State pays for the criminal prosecution expenses of \nMississippi state courts and state prosecutors, the State provides no funds for resource-\nstarved county indigent defense efforts.  The State's imposition of these defense costs on \ncotmties amounts to an unfunded mandate.  The consequences for Quitman Cotmty and \nits taxpayers, and the consequences for other small, poor counties and their taxpayers, \nhave been devastating. \n4.  The State's unfunded mandate is inherently arbitrary because of the \nunpredictability of crime on a county-by-county basis.  For example, Quitman County \nfaces possible financial ruin because of the costs of defense for two individuals, Robert \nSimon and Anthony Carr, who' have no connection with Quitman County except that they \nare accused of committing a crime here.  To pay for the hundreds of thousands of dollars \nthe trials and initial appeals cost, Quitman County had to raise taxes for three consecutive \nyears and take out a large bank loan that required three years to repay.  Quitman County \nnow has been ordered to pay for new appeals for Simon apd Carr, which could cost \n\\ \n2 \n\nhundreds of thousands of dollars more.  Quitman County may have to raise taxes again, \nincur additional debt or cut needed services. \n5.  The State recognized the shortcomings of the existing indigent defense \nefforts when it enacted the Mississippi Statewide Public Defender System Act of 1998. \nThis statute provided for much needed reforms.  However, the Legislature has not \nappropriated funds to carry out these reforms, and the Attorney General has taken the \nposition that the state Public Defender Commission -- created by statute to oversee \nindigent defense programs in Mississippi -- does not exist.  Thus, because of the dire \nstraits in which it finds itself, Quitman County and its taxpayers have no choice but to \nseekjudidal relief so that the State will fulfill its legal duties. \nParties \n6.  Quitman County brings this action in its own name and on behalf of its \ntaxpayers to vindicate important public rights.  Quitman County and its inhabitants have a \nvital interest in the provision of an adequate State-funded system of indigent \nrepresentation.  This action has been duly authorized by the Quitman County Board of \nSupervisors. \n7.  Defendant State of Mississippi is constitutionally and statutorily obligated \nto provide and fund adequate representation of indigent criminal defendants. \n8.  Defendant Kirk Fordice is sued in his official capacity as Governor.  The \nGovernor is charged with the obligation to see that the laws are faithfully executed. \n9.  Defendant Mike Moore is sued in his official capacity as Attorney \nGeneral.  The Attorney General is the chieflegal officer for the State of Mississippi. \n':.-.11-. \n3 \n\nJurisdiction and Venue \n10.  - The Court has original jurisdiction of this action.  The causes of action \nasserted herein accrue in Quitman County.  Venue is proper under Miss. Code Ann. \n§ 11-11-3. \nTHE STATE'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE \nASSIST Al'lCE OF COUNSEL TO INDIGENT DEFENDANTS \n11.  The Mississippi Constitution guarantees every accused in a criminal \nproceeding the right to be heard by counsel.  Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 26.  More than thirty-\nfive years ago, the Mississippi Supreme Court recognized the obligation of the State to \nprovide effective counsel to indigent defendants as fundamental and essential to a fair \ntrial.  Conn v. State, 170 So. 2d 20 (1964).  In so doing, the Court relied on the landmark \ndecision of the United States Supreme Court in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 355 \n(1963), holding that the State has an obligation to provide effective counsel to indigent· \ndefendants under the United States Constitution.  The Mississippi Supreme Court \nsubsequently called on the Legislature to adopt a statewide public defender system and \nprovide state funds for the representation of indigent defendants.  Wilson v. State, 574 \nSo. 2d 1338, 1340 (1990); Mease v. State, 583 So. 2d 1283, 1285 (1991). \n12.  However, instead of complying with its obligation, the State enacted and \nits executive body relied upon statutory provisions that purport to impose the costs of \nindigent defense on counties.  Miss. Code Ann. §§ 25-32-7, 99-15-17.  To the extent \nthese statutes purport to impose the fiscal obligations to provide defense counsel on \ncounties, they contravene the clear language in Conn and Gideon that the responsibility to \npay for or otherwise provide defense counsel to indigent pe!sons is an obligation ofthe \n. \\ \nState . \n. ',., ~. \n4 \n\n('-\"'~  13.  Mississippi is virtually alone in imposing the burden of paying for the \n\\ \ndefense of in_digents accused of crimes on counties.  In the last decade, Arkansas, \nTennessee and Georgia have adopted state funding of public defender systems. \n14.  The State's refusal to provide funds and its imposition of the financial \nburden on resource-starved counties has had dir.e consequences for the provision of \nindigent defense services in Mississippi.  Studies prepared for a committee of the \nMississippi Bar Association in the 1990s found: \nFunding for indigent defense is totally inadequate (amounting to \n$3.24 per capita, far less than any other state); \nThe lack of adequate resources for indigent defense services results in \npoor quality services and representation that falls beneath the \nminimum standards of representation required by the Mississippi \nConstitution; and \nThere is no statewide oversight of indigent defense, which leads to a \nhodgepodge, county-by-county approach to providing defense \nservices. \n15.  The State's lack of involvement in the provision ofindigent defense and \nthe inadequate resources available to such indigent defense means that constitutional \nrequirements for the effective a~sistance of counsel often are not met.  Studies conducted \nfor the Mississippi Bar Association found: \nResources are not sufficient to provide adequate representation \neven in felony cases, particularly in those counties using the contract \npublic defender system.  Every aspect of defense representation is \ncompromised.  Specifically, there is very little:  early representation \nprovided, investigation conducted, attorney/client contact, or use of \nexperts.  There is a low trial rate in felony and misdemeanor cases.  The \n',' ~, \n5 \n\nrequirement for contract defenders and assigned counsel to handle their \nown appeals, often with no additional compensation, creates a disincentive \nfor taking cases to trial.  Case preparation is often late, and frequently \npreliminary hearings are waived and defendants are held in j ail three to six \nmonths without counsel until arraignment in circuit court.  The overall \nsituation has led to an insufficient number of qualified attorneys willing to \ntake court appointments in indigent cases or to seek contract public \ndefender positions. \n16.  The State recognized the grave shortcomings of existing indigent defense \nefforts and the need for major refonns by enacting the Mississippi Statewide Public \nDefender System Act of 1998.  The Act acknowledges that current efforts do not protect \nthe State's \"defense interest\" o~\"guaranteeing to each accused person the effective \nassistance of competent, loyal, and independent counsel, and assuring that each such \nperson is prosecuted and punished only as may be found consistent with the due process \noflaw.\" Miss. Code Ann. §§ 25-32-33(1)(c), (2).  Nor do they secure the State's ')ustice \ninterest\" of \"administration of its criminal justice system, so as to secure the just, fair, \nspeedy, and efficient adjustment and final adjudication of each charge formally made, to \nprotect the innocent, and to punish offenders.\" Miss. Code Ann. §§ 25-32-33(1)(d), (3). \nCurrent efforts also fail to serve the State's \"budgetary interest\" in \"holding the cost of \nadministration of its criminal justice system to its optimal level, consistent with the fair \nand efficient provision of the services. reasonably necessary to advance the state's other \ninterests in the premises.\"  Miss. Code Ann. §§ 25-32-33(1)(f), (3) . \n..  \n17.  The Statewide Public Defender System Act provides that the statewide \npublic defender system created by the Act \"shall be funded by appropriations made by \nthe Legislature\" and repeals existing statutes purporting to impose the obligation to pay \nfor indigent defense on counties.  Miss. Code Ann. §§ 25-32-65(1) (emphasis added), \n25-32-21.  The Act creates a state Public Defender Commission and directs the \n.... \n~. \n6 \n\nCommission to \"implement and ensure the enjoyment of the right to counsel and the right \nto the effecti\"(e assistance of counsel secured by the Constitution ofthe United States of \nAmerica and the Constitution of the State ofMissh;:sippi.\"  Miss. Code Arm. §§ 25.,32-37, \n25-32-39(c), 25-32-41(a).  To accomplish this, the Act mandates that there shall be a \ndistrict defender in each Circuit Court district and directs the state Public Defender \nCommission to appoint district defenders.  Miss. Code Ann. §§ 25-32-39(i), 25-32-43(1). \nThe Act provides that district defenders are to be compensated at the same level as \ndistrict attorneys and further mandates that district defenders are to be given staff and \nother resources substantially equal to the district attorneys.  Miss. Code Ann. \n§§ 25-32-43(3), 25-32-63(1)(a). \n18.  The Statewide Public Defender System Act provides that it is to be \nbroadly and liberally construed to promote the State's defense, justice, budgetary and \nother interests.  Miss. Code Ann. §§ 25-32-35.  The Act specifically directs all officers \nand personnel of the criminal justice system of the State and its political subdivisions to \ncooperate with the Public Defender Commission and the district defenders in the exercise \nof their powers and the discharge of their duties.  Miss. Code Arm. § 25-32-35. \n19.  Defendants have ignored the statutory mandates of the Statewide Public \nDefender System Act of 1998.  The Legislature has failed to appropriate funds for the \nprograms and services mandated' by the Act.  The Attorney General has taken the position \nthat, because the Legislature has not appropriated funds, the statutorily-created state \nPublic Defender Commission has expired. \n20.  In sum, defendants have failed and refused to provide and pay for indigent \ndefense in breach of their constitutional and statutory obligat.ions.  In contrast, every year \nI \n' .. ' ~. \n7 \n\nthe State provides many millions of dollars in state funds to district attorneys and law \nenforcement.officials to pay for prosecution of criminal defendants, notwithstanding the \nexpress provision of Article 14, Section 261 ofthe Mississippi Constitution that \"[t]he \nexpenses of criminal prosecution shall be borne by the county in which such prosecution \nshall be begun.\" The law and fundamental fairness require that the State also provide and \npay for effective representation of indigents charged with crimes. \n21.  The State has adequate funds to comply with its constitutional and \nstatutory obligations.  The State has a budget surplus.  The State is receiving millions of \ndollars every year in revenue from the gaming industry.  The State is receiving what \neventually will amount to billions of dollars in revenue from the settlement of tobacco \nlitigation. \nHARM TO PLAINTIFF \n. 22.  Defendants' breach oftheir duties has harmed Quitman County and its \ntaxpayers (as well as other counties and taxpayers) in several ways: \n(a)  The defendants have imposed enormous and unpredictable indigent \ndefense costs on Quitman County and its taxpayers.  As a result, fmancial resources \navailable to fund schools, hospitals, local law enforcement and the traditional health, \nsafety and welfare obligations of county government have been substantially reduced. \n(b)  Defendants' imposition of indigent defense costs on counties has \ndisproportionately increased tax burdens on counties with small popUlations but \nsignificant crime problems -- often from non-residents -- such as Quitman County, and \nhas led to unequal tax burdens. \n8 \n\n(c)  Chronic underfunding of indigent defense has resulted in constitutional \nrequirements for effective assistance of counsel often not being met and has adversely \naffected the administration ofj ustice in Mississippi. \n(d)  There have been numerous post-conviction challenges to the adequacy of \ncounsel provided to indigent defendants tried for felonies in Quitman County in the past. \nThese challenges are expensive for Quitman County and its taxpayers.  Moreover, the \noverturning of convictions on appeal and subsequent retrials undenrunes confidence in \nthe administration of justice and results in an unduly wasteful, inefficient and expensive \njustice system. \n(e)  Lack of defense counsel and excessive caseloads promotes pretrial delay. \nCounties pay much of the cost associated with incarcerating defendants prior to trial \nand/or conviction.  Accordingly, excessive pretrial delays have caused Quitman County \nto spend its own funds to hold defendants in county custody, even though those costs \nproperly should be borne by the State. \nFirst Cause of Action \n23.  Paragraphs 1-22 are incorporated herein by reference as though they were \npleaded in full. \n24.  By imposing the obligation to fund indigent defense on counties, \n. \ndefendants have breached their duties under Article 3, Section 26 ofthe Mississippi \nConstitution to provide and fund adequate representation for indigent criminal \ndefendants. \n25.  Defendants' breaches of their duties have caused and will cause serious \n>;;.~\\  hann to Quitman County and its taxpayers. \nI) \noj \n,. \n9 \n\nSecond Cause of Action \n26.

Defendants' breaches of their duties have caused and will cause serious \nharm to Quitman County and its taxpayers. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, plaintiff respectfully requests the following rdief: \n(a)  Entry of a declaratory judgment that: \n(i)  Defendants are in breach of their duties under Article 3, Section 26 \nof the Mississippi Constitution; \n(ii)  Defendants are in breach oftheir duties under the Mississippi \nStatewide Public Defender System Act of 1998; \n(iii)  Statutory provisions purporting to impose obligations on counties \nto pay for the defense of indigents accused of crimes, including \nMiss.

The Center was\nfounded in June 2002 by civil fights advocates, attorneys, social service advocates, and others\ncommitted to pursuing systemic advocacy strategies that combat discrimination and poverty in\nMississippi. Through both impact and individual representation, the Center has represented the\ninterests of indigent defense clients throughout the state. The Center's President and CEO,\nMartha Bergrnark, formerly served as Senior Vice President for Programs of the National Legal\nAid and Defender Association, President and Executive Vice President of the federal Legal\nServices Corporation, and founding Executive Director of the Southeast Mississippi Legal\nServices Corporation. Its Board of Directors presently includes a former U.S. District Attorney\nfor the Southern District of Mississippi, Presiding Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and\nmany of the state's leading attorneys. Among its essential interests is resurrecting the capacity in\nMississippi for statewide, systemic, legal advocacy on behalf of low-income people and\ncommunities of color.\nThe National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (\"NACDL\"), a nonprofit\ncorporation, is the only national bar association working in the interest of public and private\ncriminal defense attorneys and their clients. NACDL was founded in 1958 to ensure justice and\ndue process for persons accused of crimes; to foster the integrity, independence, and expertise of\nthe criminal defense profession; and to promote the proper and fair administration of justice.\nNACDL has more than 11,300 members nationwide -joined by 79 state and local affiliate\norganizations with 28,000 members - including private criminal defense lawyers, public\ndefenders, and law professors committed to preserving fairness within America's criminal justice\n\nsystem.Approximately200criminaldefenselawyersinMississippiaremembersofeither\nNACDL oritsMississippiaffiliate,orboth. ManyNACDL membersareappointedtorepresent,\nhavecontractstorepresento,rwork forpublicdefenderswhorepresenti,ndigentcriminal\ndefendants.\nTheCenterandNACDL areparticipatinginthiscaseasamici curiae because they desire\nto bring matters of fact and law to the Court's attention. The Center and the members of\nNACDL are familiar with the minimum standards for indigent defense systems set by the\nMississippi and national legal communities.\nAdditionally, both the Center and NACDL have substantial legitimate interests that likely\nwill be affected by the outcome of this case and that are neither adequately represented nor\nprotected by those already parties to the case. Both the low-income clients who the Center and\nNACDL represent, and NACDL's members who are appointed to represent low-income criminal\ndefendants in Mississippi, will suffer if Quitman County's indigent defense system is declared\nconstitutionally adequate.\nIntroduction\nThree years ago, this Court ruled that if plaintiff, Quitman County, could demonstrate\nthat lack of state funding resulted in a local system of indigent defense representation \"fall[ing]\nbeneath the minimum standards of representation required by the Mississippi Constitution,\" then\nthe county would have established that defendant, the State of Mississippi, \"breached its\nconstitutional duty to provide indigent defendants with effective assistance of counsel.\" State v.\nQuitman Count),, 807 So.2d 401,408-09 (¶¶ 24-25) (Miss. 2001). The Court held that the\ncounty's allegations were sufficient to establish the constitutional violation, noting that the\ncounty had specifically alleged that \"there is very little: early representation provided,\ninvestigation conducted, attorney/client contact, or use of experts. There is a low trial rate in\n\nfelonyandmisdemeanocrases.... Casepreparationisoftenlate,andfrequentlypreliminary\nhearingsarewaivedanddefendantsareheldinjail threetosixmonthswithoutcounseluntil\narraignmenitn circuitcourt.\" Id. Significantly, consistent with caselaw holding that a showing\nof prejudice is required only in the post-conviction context, see Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU.S. 668 (1984); Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 (1 lth Cir. 1988), this Court did not suggest\nthat Quitman County needed to prove prejudice to any particular client. The question presented\nwas simple: whether the \"existing system [failed] to provide indigent defendants in Quitman\nCounty with the tools of an adequate defense.\" State v. Quitman County, 807 So.2d at 408-09\n(¶¶ 24-25).\nInstead of determining whether Quitman County had demonstrated the existence of an\ninadequate system of representation, the Circuit Court held that in the absence of evidence that\nindividual defendants had been prejudiced, it is not a constitutional violation to provide a system\nof indigent defense representation failing to meet minimum standards. Quitman County v. State,\nCiv. Action No. 99-0126 (¶¶ 65-66, 72, 77, 81) (Miss. Cir. Ct. Nov. 7, 2003). For example, the\ncourt dismissed evidence that defendants entered pleas on the same day they were arraigned and\nthat public defenders did not have the means to investigate the factual basis of their clients'\ncharges. Id.\nThe Circuit Court's ruling violated not only this Court's prior ruling in this case, but also\nprior holdings of this Court in other cases, and of other courts, that when a system of indigent\ndefense fails to provide an adequate defense, then it is unconstitutional.\nSummary. of Argument\nAmici curiae Mississippi Center for Justice and National Association of Criminal\nDefense Lawyers show in Section I that this Court was correct to rule that the Mississippi\nConstitution is violated when the indigent defense system does not meet minimum standards,\n\nevenwithoutashowingofprejudice.InSectionII, amici demonstrate that American Bar\nAssociation standards provide a good indication of the minimum standards that the Mississippi\nConstitution requires. Finally, in Section III amici show that Quitman County demonstrated that\nthe existing indigent defense system does not live up to those standards. The result is that\nindividual defendants are harmed and the Mississippi Constitution is violated.\nArgument\nI. A prejudice requirement is inappropriate in a case seeking prospective relief.\nThis Court's ruling that a constitutional violation exists if the county-based indigent\ndefense system is unable to live up to minimum standards is firmly rooted in Article 3, section 26\nof the Mississippi Constitution, which requires the effective provision of counsel to indigent\ndefendants. See Quitman County, 807 So.2d at 407 (¶ 18) (citing Mease v. State, 583 So.2d 1283\n(Miss. 1991) (Prather, J., concurring)).\nThe ruling is also supported by the reasoning of the Louisiana Supreme Court and the\nEleventh Circuit, which have both held that they are constitutionally required to order\nprospective relief when a jurisdiction is providing inadequate counsel. See State v. Peart, 621\nSo.2d 780 (La. 1993); Luckey, 860 F.2d at 1017. In State v. Peart, the Louisiana Supreme Court\nheld that because defense counsel was not provided early enough, lawyers were not conducting\nfactual investigation, and caseloads were \"excessive,\" defendants in New Orleans were not being\nprovided with constitutionally required effective assistance of counsel. 621 So.2d at 789-91. In\nLuckey v. Harris, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that if there were systemic delays in the\nappointment of counsel, lack of adequate investigative and expert resources, and pressures on\nattorneys to go to trial or enter guilty pleas, then the state was failing to \"furnish counsel in a\nmanner that meets minimum constitutional standards.\" 860 F.2d at 1016-18.\nInstead of adhering to this reasoning, the Circuit Court imported a prejudice requirement\nfrom the post-conviction appeals context, and denied Quitman County relief on the basis that the\n4\n\ncountydidnotprovehowtheoutcomesof individualcaseswereadverselyaffectedbyappointed\ncounsel'sfailuretointerviewclientsin aconfidentialmanner,conductinvestigations,anduse\nothertoolsessentialtoanadequatedefensesystem.Quitman County v. State, Civ. Action No.\n99-0126 (¶¶ 65-66, 72, 76-77, 81). This was inappropriate.\nThis Court, and other courts, have held that once judicial resources have been expended\nto convict a defendant, the courts will overturn a conviction based on the ineffective assistance of\ncounsel only when the defendant has suffered prejudice as a result. Coleman v. State, 483 So.2d\n680, 683 (Miss. 1986). The prejudice requirement preserves scarce judicial resources and\nfurthers the state's interest in the finality of convictions, ld.; Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690; Luck_.,\n860 F.2d at 1017. This case does not involve such concerns, however. Quitman County seeks\nprospective relief- it does not seek to overturn any individual convictions. Consequently, no\ndemonstration of prejudice is necessary before enjoining the prospective violation of\nconstitutional rights. As the Eleventh Circuit explained when rejecting a proposed prejudice\nrequirement in a suit seeking prospective relief to remedy the ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\"Prospective relief is designed to avoid future harm. Swift & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 311,\n326 (1928). Therefore, it can protect constitutional rights, even if the violation of these rights\nwould not affect the outcome of a trial.\" Luckey, 860 F.2d at 1017.\nHere, Quitman County seeks prospective relief regarding the State's failure to fund an\nindigent defense system providing the effective assistance of counsel. Consequently, the Circuit\nCourt should not have denied Quitman County's claim on the basis that the county did not\ndemonstrate prejudice.\nII. The ABA standards provide a good indication of the minimum standards\nrequired by the Mississippi Constitution.\nThere are at least three reasons why the Circuit Court erred in failing to use the American\nBar Association Criminal Justice Standards for the Defense Function (\"ABA Defense Function\n5\n\nStandards\")asabenchmarkfordeterminingwhetherQuitmanCounty'sindigentdefensesystem\nviolatestheMississippiConstitution:thestandardsrepresentthelegalcommunity'sconsensus\nastotheminimumrequiredof anindigentdefensesystem,thisCourtandothercourtsrelyonthe\nstandardstodeterminecompliancewiththeconstitutionalmandateofeffectiveassistancoef\ncounsel,andthestandardsmirrorthisCourt'sholdingsregardingtheminimumrequirementsofa\nconstitutionalindigentdefensesystem.\nA. Thestandards represent the consensus of the legal community\nin Mississippi and nationally.\nQuitman County's expert witnesses referred to the ABA Criminal Justice Standards for\nthe Defense Function (\"Defense Function Standards\") as a benchmark for determining whether\nthe performance of appointed counsel in Quitman County lives up to the minimum standards\nrequired by the Mississippi Constitution. See Transcript of Trial, May 1-2, 2003, p. 616\n(testimony of Steven Farese). The ABA's Defense Function Standards are well suited for this\npurpose because they represent the consensus of the national and state legal communities as to\nthe bare essentials of an adequate criminal defense system. In fact, ABA has characterized the\nDefense Function Standards - and the other standards adopted at the same time - as\n\"represent[ing] the consensus of an experienced group of prosecutors, defense attorneys, and\njudges on procedures\" for a \"fair, balanced, and constitutionally responsive\" criminal justice\nsystem.\nThe Defense Function Standards represent the consensus of the Mississippi and national\nlegal communities as a result of the rigorous process through which they were created. They\nwere created and then vetted over the course of four years, beginning with a report written by a\ncommittee of state and federal appellate and trial judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys, and\n' BriefofAmicus Curiae ABA, Kowalski v. Tesmer, 124 S. Ct. 1144 (2004).\n6\n\nprofessorsa,ndendingwith approvalby theABA's HouseofDelegates2.WhentheABA\nadoptedtheStandardsin 1968,EarlWarren,thenChiefJusticeoftheU.S.SupremeCourt,\ndescribedthemas\"the singlemostcomprehensiveandprobablythemostmonumental\nundertakinginthefieldofcriminaljusticeeverattemptedbytheAmericanlegalprofessionin\nournationalhistory.''3 Likewise,thecommenttoRule3.8oftheMississippiRulesof\nProfessionaCl onductstatesthattheABA StandardsofCriminalJusticeRelatingtothe\nProsecutionFunction- whichwereadoptedbythesameprocessastheDefenseFunction\nStandards- \"aretheproductofprolongedandcarefuldeliberationbylawyersexperiencedin\nbothcriminalprosecutionanddefense.\"MississippiRulesofProfessionaCl onduct,Commentto\nRule3.8(1987).\nTheDefenseFunctionStandardshavesincebeenupdatedtwice,mostrecentlyin 1991.\nEachtime,acommitteeofjudges,prosecutorsd,efenselawyersandprofessorsreviewsthe\nstandardsb,asedoninputfromavarioussectorsofthelegalcommunity- including,recently,the\nNational Association of Attorneys General, the National District Attorneys Association, amicus\nthe National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the National Legal Aid and Defender\nAssociation, and the U.S. Department of Justice. Then the House of Delegates - which now has\n539 members - votes on them. 4 The House of Delegates' broad membership - consisting of\nrepresentatives from each state, from each state bar association and all local bar associations with\nmore than 2,000 members, from a number of national organizations, and from ABA sections,\nzABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function and the\nDefense Function, Preface, v-vii (March 1970).\n3See ABA, Criminal Justice Standards, available at http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/standards/home.html\n(accessed June 15, 2004).\n4The Mississippi legal community is well represented in this process - the four Mississippi delegates to\nthe ABA's House of Delegates include a state representative, two representatives of the Mississippi Bar,\nand one representative of the National Association of College and University Attorneys. ABA,\nLeadership Directory (2002-03), at 20.\n7\n\ndivisions, and committees - ensures that decisions of the House of Delegates represent the views\nof the legal community.\nThis Court has demonstrated its belief that other of the ABA's Standards for Criminal\nJustice, of which the Defense Function Standards are a part, represent the legal community's\nconsensus and should be followed in Mississippi. See Walker v. State, 430 So.2d 418,421 n.3\n(Miss. 1983) (referring to Criminal Justice Standards on joinder and severance as basis for\ncourt's ruling); Sharplin v. State, 330 So.2d 591,596 n.2 (Miss. 1976) (pointing to Criminal\nJustice Standards on jury conduct as a source for model jury instruction). See also Jordan v.\nState, 786 So.2d 987, 1015 (¶ 93) (Miss. 2001) (citing Criminal Justice Standards regarding\nprosecution function); Nixon v. State, 533 So.2d 1078, 1100 n.5 (Miss. 1987) (same). 5\nB. Courts rely on the ABA standards in both the prospective relief and\npost-conviction contexts to assess compliance with the constitutional\nmandate that the government provide effective assistance of counseL.\nThe Defense Function Standards are not aspirational goals but rather a practical\ncompilation of the bare essentials of a competent defense. 6 As a result, courts rely on them\n5This Court has looked to the ABA's standards and rules for guidance in other contexts, as well. For\nexample, the Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct, which this Court approves, are based on the\nABA's Model Code of Professional Responsibility, the ABA Standards Relating to Fair Trial and Free\nPress, the ABA Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to Prosecution Function, and the ABA Model\nRules of Professional Conduct. See Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct, Comments to Rules 3.6,\n3.8, 7.2, 8.5. For other contexts in which this Court has relied on various ABA standards, see Esco v.\nScott, 735 So.2d 1002, 1005-06 (¶ 12) (Miss. 1999) (using the ABA Committee on Ethics and\nProfessional Responsibility position on the use of the title \"of counsel\"); Alexander v. The Mississippi\nBar, 725 So.2d 828, 834 (¶ 34) (Miss. 1998) (citing ABA standards for imposing lawyer sanctions as\ncriteria for the court); Stegall v. The Mississippi Bar, 618 So.2d 1291, 1295 (Miss. 1993) (stating that the\nABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions \"present helpful guidelines\"); Armstrong v. State, 573\nSo.2d 1329, 1332 (Miss. 1990) (relying on ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility and Model\nRules of Professional Conduct); Lee v. Lawson, 375 So.2d I019, 1024 (Miss. 1979) (holding that the\nABA Project on Minimum Standards Relating to Pretrial Release should serve as a guide, and stating that\n\"the standards are the result of a great deal of research and have been formulated by some of the finest\nobservers of criminal justice in this country. Adherence to these standards will go far toward the goal of\nequal justice under law.\").\n6See ABA Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants, Report to the House of Delegates\n(February 2002) (describing the Defense Function Standard and other similar standards as \"contain[ing]\n8\n\nroutinely when attempting to discern what level of competence is constitutionally required of\nappointed counsel. See, e.g., Bradford v. State, 759 So.2d 434, 440 (¶¶ 22-23) (Miss. App. 2000)\n(where a defense lawyer complied with the ABA's Defense Function Standards, \"no\nineffectiveness was shown\"); Pruett v. State, 574 So. 2d 1342,1348 (Miss. 1990) (Anderson, J.,\ndissenting) (relying on the Defense Function Standards and other ABA standards to demonstrate\nthat extensive pretrial investigation plays a \"critical and crucial\" role in capital cases).\nReliance on the Defense Function Standards is so well established that the highest courts\nof both Louisiana and Arizona have held that when a system of indigent defense departs from the\nABA Defense Function Standards, there is a rebuttable presumption that it provides ineffective\nassistance. In State v. Peart, the Louisiana Supreme Court found that the representation of\nindigent defendants in New Orleans \"routinely violate[s] the [ABA] standards on workload...\ninitial provision of counsel.., investigation.., and others,\" and that this defied the\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel. 621 So.2d at 789. Similarly, in\nState v. Smith, the Arizona Supreme Court found that the system of indigent defense in Mohave\nCounty did not conform with the Defense Function Standards and other guidelines regarding\ncompensation, case load, or competency, and that as a result there was an inference that\ndefendants' constitutional right to counsel had been violated. 681 P.2d 1374, 1380-82 (Ariz.\n1984).\nThe federal courts routinely rely on the ABA Defense Function Standards to assess\nwhether counsel's performance comports with the U.S. Constitution. For example, in Strickland\nv. Washington, the Supreme Court stated that \"prevailing norms of practice as reflected in\nAmerican Bar Association standards and the like, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-\nthe minimum requirements for legal representation at the trial, appeals, juvenile, and death penalty\nlevels\").\n\n1.1to4-8.6(2ded.1980)('The DefenseFunction')\"are\"guidestodeterminingwhatis\nreasonable,\"andwhatis,consequentlyr,equiredby theConstitution.Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n688. See also Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 2535-37 (2003) (same); United\nStates v. Gipson, 985 F.2d 212, 215-16 (5th Cir. 1993) (determining that a client who was not\ninformed of the time limit for filing an appeal was denied the effective assistance of counsel\nunder the ABA Defense Function Standards).\nC. This Court's determination regarding minimum standards is similar\nto the ABA's determination.\nWhen this Court has had occasion to determine the basic level of defense representation\nthat the Mississippi Constitution and U.S. Constitution require, it has reached conclusions\nremarkably similar to those reached in the ABA Defense Function Standards. For example, this\nCourt insists, as do the Standards, that appointed counsel must:\n1) consult with each client in a timely manner. See Ferguson v. State, 507 So.2d 94, 96\n(Miss. 1987); ABA Defense Function Standards 4-3.2 (a), 4-3.8(a);\n2) be familiar with the law governing each client'scase. See Ward v. State, 708 So.2d\n11, 14-15 (¶ 19) (Miss. 1998); ABA Defense Function Standard 4-5.1 (a);\n3) consult with each client regarding important decisions and developments. See\nLeatherwood v. State, 473 So.2d 964, 969 (Miss. 1985); ABA Defense Function\nStandards 4-3.8, 4-5.2;\n4) file critical motions. See Triplett v. State, 666 So.2d 1356, 1361-62 (Miss. 1995);\nABA Defense Function Standards 4-1.3(b), 4-3.6, 4-7.9;\n5) zealously defend the client during hearings and trials. See Moody v. State, 644 So.2d\n451,456-57 (Miss. 1994); Stringer v. State, 627 So.2d 326, 330 (Miss. 1993); Stewart v.\nState, 229 So.2d 53, 53-56 (Miss. 1969); ABA Defense Function Standard 4-1.2(lo);\n10\n\n6)conductanindependenftactualinvestigationofassignedcases.See Triplett, 666\nSo.2d at 1361; State v. Tolonan, 564 So.2d 1339, 1342 (Miss. 1990); Ferguson, 507\nSo.2d at 96 (same); ABA Defense Function Standard 4-4.1;\n7) counsel a client to enter a guilty plea only after the attorney has determined, through\nconfidential communications with the client, whether accepting the plea is in the client's\nbest interests, and only after the attorney has, in a confidential manner, advised the client\nof the maximum sentencing possible under the plea. See Ward, 708 So.2d at 14 (¶¶ 15-\n23); Alexander v. State, 605 So.2d 1170, 1172 (Miss. 1992); Vittitoe v. State, 556 So.2d\n1062, 1063 (Miss. 1990); ABA Defense Function Standards 4-6.1(b), 4-6.2 (b); and\n8) advocate for the best possible and most appropriate sentence for a convicted client.\nSee Brown v. State, 749 So.2d 82, 91 (¶ 21) (Miss. 1999); ABA Defense Function\nStandard 4-8.1 (b).\nBecause the ABA standards so closely mirror this Court's holdings, and because they\nrepresent the legal community's consensus, the Circuit Court erred in holding that even though\nQuitman County's indigent defense system fails to provide representation in accordance with the\nABA's standards, the Mississippi Constitution is not violated and prospective relief is not\nwarranted.\n111. The county-based indigent defense system fails to provide representation in\naccordance with the minimum standards set by the Mississippi Constitution\nand with authoritative standards.\nAt trial, Quitman County proved that the part-time indigent defense system results in the\nfailure to do many of the things that this Court and the ABA's Defense Function Standards agree\nare essential tools of an adequate defense. For example, the county established that the part-time\npublic defenders are first appointed to represent their clients at arraignment, where they often\nmeet clients in groups, sometimes even in the open courtroom in earshot of the prosecutor and\n11\n\njudge,andconsequentlyfail toengageintheconfidentialdiscussionsrequiredbytheDefense\nFunctionStandards.Quitman County v. State, Civ. Action No. 99-0126 (¶ 28, 31, 33). See also\nABA Defense Function Standard 4-3.1 (b).\nQuitman County also proved that the part-time \"public defenders are not provided\nfunding for investigators and have never petitioned the court for funding to employ an\ninvestigator in a non-capital case.\" Quitman County v. State, Civ. Action No. 99-0126 (¶ 29).\nThis violates this Court's statements, and the Defense Function Standards, both of which\ncharacterize factual investigation as necessary to an effective defense. See discussion supra §\nII.C.6.\nImmediately after the initial meeting, on the same day as the arraignment where the\naccused are informed of the charges against them, many clients plead guilty, despite the lack of\nconfidential discussion or any opportunity to conduct fact investigation. Quitman Count3, v.\nState, Civ. Action No. 99-0126 (¶ 31,33). This violates this Court's instruction, and the\nDefense Function Standards, requiring fact investigation and confidential communication. It\nalso violates this Court's instruction, and the Defense Function Standards, permitting entry of a\nplea only after the attorney has determined, through confidential communications with the client,\nwhether accepting the plea is in the client's best interests, and only after the attorney has, in a\nconfidential manner, advised the client of the maximum sentencing possible under the plea. See\ndiscussion supra § II.C.6, II.C.7.\nQuitman County also demonstrated that the \"public defenders do not submit pre-\nsentencing reports.\" Quitman County v. State, Civ. Action No. 99-0126 (¶ 35). This violates\nthis Court's statements, and the Defense Function Standards, both of which require defense\ncounsel to advocate for the best possible sentence for the client. See discussion supra § II.C.8.\nThus, in significant ways, the county-based system departs from this Court's instructions and the\n12\n\nDefense Function Standards, and results in ineffective assistance, in violation of the\nconstitutionally required right to counsel.\nThe impact on clients - as demonstrated in the following two cases - is dramatic, v After\nWan-at Stewart was arrested on rape charges in Quitman County on April 13, 1995, he was\nunable to speak to his appointed lawyer for four months despite vigorous efforts to do so, in\nviolation of the lawyer's obligation to consult with him in a timely manner. See discussion supra\n§ II.C. 1. In violation of counsel's duty to conduct factual investigation, see discussion supra §\nII.C.6, he ignored Mr. Stewart's request for a DNA test, declined to read Mr. Stewart's rendition\nof the events leading to the arrest, refused to contact character or alibi witnesses, and ignored a\ndocument Mr. Stewart showed him, which might have proven that Mr. Stewart was in prison\nwhen the State claimed the crime was committed. As a result, counsel was unable to form an\neducated opinion regarding Mr. Stewart's guilt or innocence, or his chances of success at trial.\nNonetheless, counsel urged Mr. Stewart to plead guilty, in violation of counsel's duty to advise\nMr. Stewart to enter a guilty plea only after determining whether doing so was in Mr. Stewart's\nbest interests. See discussion supra § II.C.7. Mr. Stewart took his attorney's advice and\nreceived a mandatory 15-year sentence. After the plea was entered, counsel refused to\ncommunicate with Mr. Stewart or to send him copies of his own documents. As a result, Mr.\nStewart was unable to seek post-conviction relief in a timely manner.\nDiana Brown was arrested in Quitman County on October 31, 1997, and released on bond\n!\nsix weeks later. The following February, she learned from a friend that her case was scheduled\nfor presentation to the grand jury. Although she took the initiative and located her assigned\ncounsel, he would not accept and never returned her phone calls, in violation of his duty to\ncommunicate with his clients in a timely manner. See discussion supra § II.C.1. Bail was\n7Warrat Stewart and Diana Brown participated as an amici curiae in this case before this Court in 2001.\nThis rendition of the facts of their cases comes from their brief.\n13\n\nsubsequently revoked, and she was jailed. It was only then that she met her assigned counsel - at\nthe courthouse. As she stood in a group often other accused persons, counsel read the charges\nand the proffered plea bargain out loud, in violation of his obligation to consult with his client in\na confidential setting. See ABA Defense Function Standard 4-3.1(b). In the next breath, counsel\ninformed Ms. Brown that she was facing 60 years in prison, was being offered a plea to a charge\nthat would carry the sentence often years, and that she had five minutes to decide what to do.\nWhen Ms. Brown asked for more time, counsel informed her that she was guilty and that she\nshould accept the plea. Because the attorney had not consulted with Ms. Brown and had not\nconducted any factual investigation, his recommendation that she plead guilty violated his duty\nto counsel her to enter a guilty plea only after determining whether doing so was in her best\ninterests. See discussion supra § II.C.7. Additionally, his refusal to advocate for more time for\nher violated his obligation to consult with her regarding important decisions, and to zealously\ndefend her. See discussion supra §§ II.C.3, II.C.5. Ms. Brown accepted the plea and was\nsentenced to ten years. As a result of counsel's failure to conduct any factual investigation and\nto consult with his client in a confidential setting, he failed to learn essential facts, including that\nMs. Brown suffers fi'om polio and is an alcoholic. He was not able to provide Ms. Brown with\ninformed advice about the strength or weakness of her case at trial, or about the sentence she was\nlikely to receive if convicted, as a result of which she was unable to make an informed decision\nabout whether to plead guilty.\nThese stories demonstrate the severe personal toll that inadequate counsel takes on\nindividual defendants. Counsel who fail to interview, investigate, or engage in sentencing\nadvocacy abdicate their responsibility to test the State's evidence. Their representation is akin to\na total deprivation of counsel. Their clients cannot obtain advice to enable them to make\nimportant decisions about their cases, they cannot present essential evidence to a neutral finder\n14\n\noffact,theycannotfile appealsa, ndtheycannotdootherthingsessentiatloensuringthatthey\nreceiveafairtrial.

Quitman\nCounty has demonstrated that the current system fails to meet these standards, resulting in a\nconstitutional violation. For the reasons stated herein, amici curiae support the appeal of\nQuitman County, and respectfully request the Court to reverse the decision of the Circuit Court\nin this case.\n( k._av/kf')_/lille_TB4r _\"o. 99638)\n',...JJe_j£er A.

The  MTLA  and  the \nMBA  also jointly  filed  a  brief as  amici curiae  in  Wilson  v.  State,  574  So.  2d  1338  (Miss. \n1990).  Both  organizations  are  uniquely  concerned  about  improving  the  current  level  of \n \nrepresentation  indigent  defendants  receive  from  defense  counsel.  Moreover,  because  the \nMTLA  includes  many  criminal  defense  lawyers,  former prosecutors,  and  the  MBA \nincludes  a  number  of lawyers  appointed  to  represent  indigent  defendants  on  a  piecemeal \nbasis,  amici  can  attest  to  the  fact  that  the  current  system  fails  to  meet  even  minimal \nstandards  for  effective  assistance  of counsel. \nBACKGROUND \nRather  than  create  a  system  of indigent  defense  and  pay  the  cost,  the  State  of \nMississippi  has  placed  the  burden  on  individual  counties.  Those  counties  --  particularly \nthe  small,  rural  counties  --  cannot  afford  the  financial  price  of creating  a  fair  and  effective \nsystem.  In  its  complaint  in  the  present  case,  Quitman  County  points  out  the  economic \nproblems  visited  upon  it because  this  state  responsibility  has  been  shifted  to  individual \ncounties. \nThe  financial  problems  affect  the  ability  of public  defenders  to  do their job.  In \nQuitman  County,  two  public  defenders  represent  all  indigent  defendants.’  Quitman \nCounty  pays  each  attorney  a  salary  of $1,350  per  month.  This  salary  is  intended  to  cover \nali  costs  and  expenses  incurred  in  such  representation,  including  administrative \nassistance,  legal  research,  travel,  and  counsel’s  time.  Accordingly,  every  time  the  public \ndefender  determines  an  independent  investigation  is  necessary  to  present  an  adequate \ndefense,  counsel  must  petition  the  court  for  funds  to  pay  the  investigator.  If the  trial  court \ndenies  the  request  because  it  determines  that  the  county  is  unable  to  afford  the  expense, \nthe  public  defender  is  left  to  either pay  the  investigator  out  of his  own  pocket  or  forego \nany  independent  investigation.  Likewise,  if counsel  believes  that  a  forensic  or psychiatric \n  \n*  Amici  have  excerpted  all  statistical  and  factual  information  referenced  herein  from  the \nbrief filed  by  Appellee  Quitman  County  dated  April  11,  2001. \n2 \n  \n \nexpert  would  be  helpful  to  the  defendant’s  cause,  counsel  either  must  pay  for  such \nexperts  from  his  own  salary  and  hope  that  the  court  will  see  fit  to  recompense  him,  or he \nmust  ask  the  court  for  funds  for  an  expert  before  retaining  an  expert.  If the  court  denies \nthe  request,  the  defendant’s  case  simply  proceeds  without  the  assistance  of an  expert \nretained  on  his  behalf. \nThe  public  defenders  of Quitman  County  are  responsible  for  representing  indigent \ndefendants  in  circuit  court  and  on  appeals  to  this  Court.  By  contrast,  the  District \nAttorney’s  office,  funded  primarily  by  the  State,  represents  the  State  in  circuit  court.  The \nMississippi  Attorney  General’s  office,  itself an  arm  of the  State,  represents  the  State  on \nappeals  to  this  Court.  Attorneys  in  the  District  Attorney’s  office  and  the  Attorney \nGeneral’s  office  are  paid  a  salary  with  benefits,  and  have  available  to  them  the  medical \nand  forensic  experts  from  the  Mississippi  State  Crime  Lab,  as  well  as  the  investigative \nservices  of the  police  force. \nQuitman  County  has  been  unable  to  afford  an  adequate  system  of indigent \ndefense,  and  its  efforts  to  shoulder  the  burden  placed  on  it  by  the  State  of Mississippi \nhave  led  to  serious  financial  problems.  These  problems  are  not  limited  to  Quitman \nCounty,  but  exist  throughout  the  State.  Of the  eighty-two  counties  in  Mississippi,  only \nthree  have  full-time  public  defender’s  offices.  The  other  counties have  part-time  public \ndefenders,  such  as  are  employed  in  Quitman  County,  or  appoint  counsel  on  a  case-by- \ncase  basis. \nQuitman  County  has  filed  suit  against  the  State  of Mississippi  seeking  relief that \nwill  lead  to  the  State  assuming  the  responsibility  for  indigent  defense.  The  State  filed  an \ninterlocutory  appeal  from the  Circuit  Court’s  denial  of its  motion  to  dismiss  Quitman \nCounty’s  claims.  This  Court  granted  review  of the  State’s  interlocutory  appeal. \n3 \n  \n \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE  CURRENT  SYSTEM  OF  FUNDING  VIOLATES  THE \nCONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHT  TO  EFFECTIVE  ASSISTANCE  OF \nCOUNSEL \nIn  Gideon  v.  Wainwright,  372  U.S.  335,  344  (1963),  the  United  States  Supreme \nCourt  held  that  the  United  State  Constitution  charges  each  state  with  the  obligation  to \nprovide  assistance  of counsel  to  indigent  defendants  in  all  felony  cases.  Under  the  United \nStates  Constitution,  a  state’s  obligation  to  provide  counsel  to  an  indigent  defendant \ncharged  with  a  felony  “‘cannot  be satisfied  by  mere  formal  appointment.’” o55  Evitts  v. \nLucey,  469  U.S.  387,  395  (1985)  (quoting  Avery  v.  Alabama,  308  U.S.  444,  446  (1940)). \nMississippi  has  long  recognized  that  the  right  to  assistance  of counsel  is  the  right  to \neffective  assistance  of counsel,  and  that  the  right  “is  further  secured  to  the  citizens  of this \nstate  by  the  Mississippi  Constitution  of  1890,  Article  3,  Section  26.”  See  Read v.  State, \n430  So.  2d  832,  837  (Miss.  1983);  Triplett  v.  State,  666  So.  2d  1356,  1357  (Miss.  1995). \nSee  also  Evitts  v.  Lucey,  469  U.S.  at  395  (1985)  (finding  that  indigent  defendant  is \nentitled  to  effective  assistance  of counsel  on  first  appeal  as  of right). \nA.  This  Court  Already  Has  Urged  the  Legislature  to  Meet  Its \nConstitutional  Obligation  to  Provide  Effective  Assistance  of \nCounsel  to  Indigent  Defendants  in  Mississippi \nRather  than  fulfil!  the  constitutional  mandate  of providing  effective  assistance  of \ncounsel  itseff,  the  Mississippi  Legislature  has  chosen to  delegate  this  duty  to  the  resource- \nstarved  counties  of the  State  of Mississippi.  Even  worse,  the  Legislature  has  known  since \nat  least  1990  that,  regardless  of its  efforts  to  sidestep  the  issue,  the  problem  of inadequate \ndefense  permeates  every  county  in  the  State  that  cannot  afford  to  adequately  fund  a \npublic  defender’s  office.  This  Court  already  has  called  upon  the  Legislature  to  provide \nstatewide,  state-funded  indigent  defense,  instead  of imposing  the  obligation  on  counties \n4 \n  \n \nthat  clearly  cannot  handle  the  financial  burden.  Mease  v.  State,  583  So.  2d  1283,  1285 \n(Miss.  1991)  (“the  Legislature  [should]  address  the  problem  of indigent  representation  on \na  statewide  basis,  rather  than  thrust  the  burden  on  financially-strapped  counties”).  This \nCourt  has  recognized  the  unfairness  of funding  the  prosecution  in  indigent  defendant \ncases  when  the  defense  must  rely  on  the  substantially  smaller  county  coffers.  See  Wilson \nv.  State,  574  So,  2d  1338,  1341  (Miss.  1990)  (we  would  encourage  the  Legislature  to \nreview  the  system  and  provide  funds  for the  representation  of indigent  defendants  in \ncapital  cases  from  State  funds  rather  than  county  funds.  Since  the  State  funds  the \nprosecution  in  these  cases,  why  not  the  defense?”’).  Indeed,  this  Court  recently  found  — \nyet  again  —  that  the  Legislature  has  failed  to  fulfill  its  constitutional  duties  and  has \nordered  adequate  compensation  of defense  counsel  and  payment  of reasonable  litigation \nexpenses,  including  investigation  and  expert  costs,  in  capital  post-conviction  proceedings. \nJackson  v.  State,  732  So.  2d  187,  188-89,  191  (Miss.  1999). \nB.  The  Mississippi  Legislature  Recognizes  the  Problems  Inherent  in \nDelegating  Its  Constitutional  Duties  to  the  Counties  But  Has \nChosen  to  Ignore  Its  Responsibility  to  Provide  Effective  Assistance \nof Counsel \nEven  the  Mississippi  Legislature  has  recognized  the  inherent  problems  in  the \ncurrent  system  of defense.  In  1998,  the  Legislature  enacted  the  Mississippi  Statewide \nPublic  Defender  System  Act  of  1998  (the  “MSPDS  Act’),  which  authorized  a  full-time \nstatewide  public  defender’s  office.  See  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  25-32-33.”  The  Legislature \nfound  that  the  current  system  does  not  protect  the  State’s  “defense  interest”  of \n“guaranteeing  to  each  accused  person  the  effective  assistance  of competent,  loyal,  and \n  \n”  As  is  discussed  below,  no  funding  was  provided  for  implementation  of the  Mississippi \nStatewide  Public  Defender  System  Act  of  1998.  The  statute  has  since  been  repealed. \n5 \n \nindependent  counsel,  and  assuring  that  each  such  person  is  prosecuted  and  punished  only \nas  may  be  found  consistent  with  due  process  of law.”  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  25-32- \n33  (1){c);  (2).  The  Legislature  also  found  that the  current  system  does  not  adequately \nprotect the  State’s  “justice  interest”  in  fair  “administration  of its  criminal justice  system \nso  as  to  secure  the just,  fair,  speedy  and  efficient  adjustment  and  final  adjudication  of \neach  charge  formally  made,  to  protect the  innocent  and  to  punish  offenders.”  Miss.  Code \nAnn.  §§  25-32-33  (1)(d);  (3). \nDespite  its  clear  findings  that  the  system  of funding  indigent  defense  on  a  county- \nby-county  basis  failed  to  fulfill  the  State’s  constitutional  duty  to  provide  effective \nassistance  of counsel,  the  Legislature  failed  to  fund  the  MSPDS  Act  and  eventually \nrepealed  it.  The  Legislature  instead  has  created  and  funded  an  office  solely  dedicated  to \nrepresenting  indigent  defendants  in  capital  post-conviction  proceedings.  Miss.  Code \nAnn.  §§  99-39-103.  This  partial  relief,  while  helpful,  is  an  inadequate  solution  to  the \nproblems  inherent  in  the  current  system  of providing  indigent  defense. \nII.  THE  CURRENT  SYSTEM  OF  FUNDING  DOES  NOT  MEET  THE \nNEEDS  OF  DEFENSE  COUNSEL  WHO  REPRESENT  INDIGENT \nDEFENDANTS \nAs  this  Court  has  indicated  and  the  Legislature  has  recognized,  the  current  system \nof funding  does  not  adequately  meet  the  needs  of defense  counsel  representing  indigent \ndefendants.  The  system  does  not permit  the  routine  use  of investigators.  They  are \nauthorized  by  circuit  courts  only  in  exceptional  cases.  The  same  is  true  for  expert \nwitnesses. \nGiven  the  inadequate  compensation  they  receive  under  the  current  system,  the \npart-time  public  defenders  may  supplement  their  income  by  representing  other  criminal \n6 \n  \n \ndefendants  on  a  private  basis,  as  well  as  parties  in  civil  matters.  Unfortunately,  the  lack \nof adequate  compensation  for  their  indigent  defense  work  creates  an  incentive  to  spend \nproportionally  less  time  on  indigent  cases  and  more  time  on  private, paying  clients.  This \ninevitably  results  in  the  substantial  risk  that  an  attorney  may,  consciously  or \nunconsciously,  fail  to  devote  the  time  required  to  ensure  that  an  indigent  defendant \nreceives  effective  representation.  Between  two  criminal  defendants  competing  for  an \nattorney’s  time,  an  attorney  may,  again  consciously  or  unconsciously,  more  zealously \nrepresent the  interests  of the  paying  client  while  sacrificing  those  of the  indigent  client. \nMoreover,  the  defense  lawyer  who  receives  such  a  minimal  amount  of \ncompensation  in  representing  an  indigent  defendant  faces  the  agonizing  decision  of \nspending  his  own  money,  which  he  would  otherwise  use  to  support  his  family,  instead  to \ndefend  his  client.  An  attorney  cannot  reasonably  be  expected,  and  should  not  be \ncompelled,  to  choose  between  performing  functions  he  believes  are  necessary  to  preserve \nthe  liberty  of his  client  and  ensuring  the  economic  well-being  of his  family.  This \nuntenable  state  of affairs  highlights  the  problems  inherent  in  the  existing  county-based \nsystem  of indigent  defense. \n  \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe State’s decision to delegate its constitutional obligations to financially strapped counties \nhas  created  an  inadequate  and  unconstitutional  system  of  indigent  defense.  This  is  a  matter  for \nwhich the  State  is  responsible,  and  it  ultimately  must  bear  the  burden  to  create a  fair,  efficient  and \nconstitutional  system.  Quitman  County  should  be  permitted  to  proceed  with  its  case,  and  the \ndecision  of the  Circuit  Court  denying  the  State’s  motion  to  dismiss  should  be  affirmed. \nDated:  April  17  2001. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nMISSISSIPPI TRIAL  LAWYERS’  ASSOCIATION \nwv  ae \nLance  L.

They hail  from  counties  all  over \nthe  state,  including Quitman County.  Amici were  charged  with  a range  of crimes,  and their  cases  were \nresolved  with  a variety  of dispositions,  but common  themes  unite their  stories:  all  received  ineffective \nlegal  representation  from  impoverished county-funded  public defense  systems.  Amici’s  experiences \nstarkly  illustrate the  failures  of the county-funded  systems.  Typically,  in  their cases: \n°  there  was  significant  delay  in  the  appointment  of counsel; \n‘  meetings  between  clients and counsel  were  cursory  and  usually  took place  in  court  immediately \nbefore  critical  hearings; \n.  counsel  lacked  funds  to  investigate  cases,  conduct legal  research,  and  hire  experts;  appointed \ncounsel  often  instructed  their  clients  to conduct their  own  investigations; \n°  appointed  counsel  were  burdened with  overwhelming caseloads  and  often  urged  defendants  to \naccept pleas  without  adequately  explaining  the  terms  of the  pleas  and  without  weighing the  costs \nand  benefits  of accepting pleas  versus  going to trial; \n.  no  defense  services  were  available pre-trial,  during critical  hearings,  or during  sentencing,  and  no \nsuch  services were  available  for non-capital  post-conviction  relief.  Without  exception,  amici \nhave  been  unable  to  obtain  post-conviction  assistance.' \nAmici’s  stories  are critically  relevant to  the  issue  in this  case:  whether  Mississippi’s  failure  to \nfund  indigent defense  is  resulting  in  a  constitutional  crisis  by depriving  poor  criminal  defendants  of their \nright to  counsel.  Amici’s  stories  show that Mississippi’s county-funded  systems of indigent defense,  by \n  \n'  The  State  argued below  that post-conviction  relief is  readily available  to  amici  and  similarly \nsituated  defendants  and therefore  any  flaws  in  indigent  defense  services can  be  adequately  addressed  in \npost-conviction  proceedings.  This  argument  is  flawed  for several  reasons:  1)  non-capital  post-conviction \nrelief is  unavailable  to  indigent defendants— neither  the  State  nor counties  provide  attorneys  for non- \ncapital  post-conviction  petitions;  2)  as  several  amici  report,  after  disposition  of their  cases,  defendants \nmay  never  hear  from their counsel  again  and  are  unable to  obtain  their files  and  other  documents  critical \nto  their  pursuit  of post-conviction  relief,  and  3)  most  importantly,  the  Constitutions  of the  United  States \nand the  State  of Mississippi  guarantee  amici and  similarly  situated  defendants  effective,  competent \ncriminal  defense  representation at their trials,  before they  lose their  liberty,  not after they  have  been \nconvicted  and  sentenced. \n  \n \n/  j  © \ndepriving  amici  of their right  to  effective  representation  in  criminal  proceedings,  are  falling  far  short of \nthe  constitutional  guarantee  of a criminal defendant’s  right to  counsel. \nARGUMENT: \nMississippi’s  Failure to  Fund  Indisvent Defense  Services  Violates  the  Fundamental  Constitutional \nRight  to  the Effective  Assistance  of Counsel. \nOne  of the  most  important rights Mississippians  enjoy  when  facing criminal  charges  is  access  to \ncompetent  legal  services  regardless  of one’s  ability  to  pay.’  Today,  basic,  no-frills  effective \nrepresentation  includes:  (1)  timely and  periodic  consultation  with  clients  while  cases  are  pending;’  (2) \nreasonably thorough  investigation of cases;’  (3) knowledge  of the  law governing each  client’s  case;°  (4) \nroutine  consultation  with  clients  regarding  important  developments  and  decisions;°  (5)  filing  of critical \n  \n2  “ven  the  intelligent  and  educated  layman  .  .  .  requires  the  guiding hand  of counsel  at every \nstep  in  the  proceedings  against  him.

Because  Mississippi’s  counties \ncurrently  bear  the  entire  responsibility for  funding  non-capital  indigent defense  services,  regardless  of \ntheir capacity to  provide  adequately  such  services,  public defenders  and  court-appointed  counsel  often \nfall  short  of these  basic  standards  of effective  representation.” \nAcknowledging the  myriad  problems  plaguing the  State’s  indigent  defense  services,  this  Court \npreviously  has  urged  the  State  to  institute a  state-wide public defender  system to  insure that defendants \nare  represented  by  counsel at  all  stages of their criminal  proceedings.’*  In  fact,  this  Court  has  recognized \neven  in  civil  cases  involving fundamental rights,  the right to  counsel  is critical  and well-established.  And \nyet,  at  present,  the  State  leaves  unfulfilled  the  right to  counsel  in non-capital  criminal  cases.  Report  after \nreport  confirms  that the  right  to  counsel  remains  unfulfilled because of the  State’s decision  to  relegate the \nentire responsibility  of funding  indigent  defense  services  to the  counties.\"  The  State’s  refusal  to \ncontribute  to  indigent  defense  services  harms  poor  criminal  defendants  every  day  by  abrogating their \n  \n'2  Many of these  attorneys  practice  criminal  defense  only  part-time  and  use  their contracts  with \nthe  counties  to  supplement  their  incomes  from  private  practice. \n'3  Given the  minimal  compensation  afforded  appointed  counsel  in  most  Mississippi  counties  for \ntheir  time  and  out-of-pocket  expenses,  counsel’s  performance  is  hardly  surprising.

The  poor quality  of \nrepresentation  afforded  indigent  defendants  fosters  the  perception  that justice  is  available  only to  the \nwealthy. \nAt  present,  the  entire  responsibility  for  providing defense  services  to  the  poor  belongs  to  each \ncounty,  regardless of its  ability to  provide  such  services.  In  many  counties,  even  when  attorneys  are \navailable for  appointment to  indigent defendants,  inadequate  funding  seriously hampers  the  lawyers’ \nefforts to  provide  effective  assistance to  their clients.\"  Defense  attorneys  face  staggering  caseloads, \ninadequate compensation,  insufficient  staff and  resources,  and  a lack  of training and  supervision.  These \ninadequate  defense  systems  are  a predictable  result of Mississippi’s  unwillingness  to  financially support \nindigent  defense  services  in  every county  across the  State. \nNo  responsible  body  asserts  that the  solution  to  this  problem  is  to  demand  that the  counties \nexpend  additional  funds on  indigent defense.  Many  counties  simply  cannot  expand  indigent defense \nspending.'’  Moreover,  because  the  current  system  requires  local jurisdictions  to  bear  the  entire  expense \nof the  provision  of indigent  defense  services,  and  those  localities  have  varying  levels  of revenue  on \nwhich  they  can  draw,  the  quality  of legal  representation  available to  the  poor varies  significantly across \nthe  state.

The  stories  of amici illustrate  the \nunacceptable  effects  the  dearth  of state  funding  has  had  on  the quality of representation  available to  poor \ncriminal  defendants  in  Mississippi. \nAMICI EXPERIENCES \nAmici’s  experiences  demonstrate the chronic  shortcomings of Mississippi’s  current approach to \nindigent defense.  Defendants  with  court-appointed counsel  have  no  meaningful access  to  their  attorneys. \nIndigent  defendants  are  not afforded  basic  defense  services  such  as  investigators  and  expert witnesses. \nAmici’s  stories  are riddled with  evidence of a  systemic  breakdown  in  the  quality  of representation \nindigent  defendants  in  Mississippi  receive  at trial,  conviction,  and  sentencing.  These  stories  are  neither \natypical nor  extreme.  Rather,  they  are the almost inevitable  byproduct of Mississippi’s  current approach \nto  indigent  defense,  whereby the  level  of resources  available  for  defense  services,  and  the  quality  of \nrepresentation that an  indigent  defendant receives,  depend largely on:  a) where  the  defendant  resides,  or \nb)  where  the crime took  place. \n1.  No  Meaningful Access  to  Court-appointed  Counsel: \na.  Amicus  Warrat Stewart  (Quitman County):  Warrat  Stewart  was arrested  for rape  on  April \n13,  1995.  Although the  court appointed  him  an  attorney at his  bail  hearing,  Stewart  did  not  speak to  his \nattorney until July  16,  1995.  At that time,  counsel  consulted with  Stewart  for five minutes and  suggested \nhe  plead  guilty.  Despite  Stewart’s  request that counsel  pursue  DNA testing,  counsel  never  did  so. \nStewart was  indicted on  August  15,  1995.  Thereafter,  Stewart’s  lawyer visited  him in jail  only  once  for \n  \n'8  The  State’s  assertion  that  its  funding  capital  indigent defense  is  sufficient to  relieve counties  of \nthe  burden  of paying  for  indigent  defense  services  is  untenable.  The  State’s  limiting  its funding to  capital \nindigent  defense  provides  little  relief for many  Mississippi  counties.  For  example,  a  review  of Plaintiff's \ncriminal  dockets  shows that of a total  of 327  criminal  cases  prosecuted  in  Quitman  County  beginning  in \n1995  through  2000,  at  least 256 were  handled  by  court-appointed  counsel.  Only 7  of the  cases  handled \nby  court-appointed  counsel  were  capital  cases. \n  \n \nri \n.  © \nabout ten  minutes,  and  asked  Stewart to  make  a  list of potential  witnesses  and  to write  down  his  account \nof his  participation  in  the  alleged  crime.  Stewart complied,  but  counsel  never  retrieved the  information, \neven  after  Stewart informed  him  it was  ready. \nStewart  next  met counsel  a  month  later,  at the  first  day  of his trial.  Stewart  again  tried  to  give \ncounsel  his  list of character and  alibi  witnesses,  but counsel  said  he  did  not need  the  list.  Stewart  also \nshowed  counsel  a  discharge  certificate  proving  Stewart was  in  prison  when  the  State  claimed  the  crime \nbegan.  Counsel told  Stewart the  certificate was  useless,  but  did  not  explain why.  Instead  of putting \ntogether a  defense  for trial,  counsel  urged  Stewart to  plead  guilty  and assured  him that  he would  be \nsentenced to  fifteen  years,  with  the  possibility  of early  release.  Stewart  learned  only  after  he pleaded \nguilty that the  fifteen-year  sentence  was  mandatory. \nCounsel  never contacted  Stewart  following his  sentencing.  On March  31,  1996,  Stewart wrote  to \nCounsel  requesting a  copy  of his  file  so that he  could  timely  seek  post-conviction  relief.  Counsel  never \nresponded.  The  court provided  Stewart with  some  documents  from his  file.  Stewart’s  request for  a  copy \nof his  transcript went  unanswered.  Stewart used  the  documents  he  received  from  the  court  to  seek  post- \nconviction  relief,  but  his  petition was  denied  in  March, 1998,  because  of procedural  flaws.  The  prison \nlaw  library was  closed,  so  he  had  no  way  of continuing to help  himself and  he  could  not afford  to  hire  an \nattorney. \nBasic  defense  in  Stewart’s  case would  have  included:  counsel’s timely  consultation with  Stewart \nabout the  issues  in  his  case;  a reasonably  adequate  investigation  of the  facts,  including  Stewart’s  alibi  and \nhis  claims  of innocence;  counsel’s thorough  preparation  for trial;  and  counsel’s  accurate  explanation  to \nStewart of the terms  of the  plea offer. \nb.  Amicus  Jimmy  Redwine (Panola  County):  Jimmy  Redwine  is  an  inmate  at the  Panola \nCounty Jail  in  Batesville,  Mississippi.  He  is  serving  an  eleven-year  sentence  for manslaughter.  Redwine \npleaded  guilty to  the  crime  on  the  advice of his  appointed  counsel.  On  March  24,  2000,  a judge \nsentenced  Redwine  to  fifteen years,  four of which were  suspended. \n   \nrf \nRedwine’s  problems  began  in  1999, when  a  cocaine  addict named  Jimmy “Bo”  Shelton  broke \ninto  Redwine’s  house.  Redwine had  Shelton  arrested,  and he was  charged with trespassing.  After \nShelton  was  released  from  the county jail,  he  continued  to  harass  Redwine.  Shelton’s  behavior  escalated \nuntil,  on  January  11,  2000,  he  appeared  at Redwine’s  door  in  the  middle  of the night  and  repeatedly \nthreatened  to  kill  him.  By  this  time,  local  law enforcement  was  well  aware  of Redwine’s  history  of \nproblems  with  Shelton.  On that night,  after Shelton  ignored  Redwine’s  several  requests  that he  leave  his \nproperty,  Redwine fired  his  roommate’s  gun twice  in the  air  to  scare  Shelton  away.  (Redwine  himself \nnever owned  a  gun  and  had  no  prior record  of violent crime.)  Despite  Redwine’s  efforts,  Shelton  broke \ndown  the  door to  the  house.  A  scuffle  ensued  in which  Redwine  accidentally  shot  Shelton  in  his  side. \nRedwine  immediately called the  police  and  an  ambulance.  Shelton  later died  from the  gun  shot wound. \nRedwine’s  roommate  and  the  roommate’s  sister witnessed  the  incident. \nRedwine’s  court-appointed  counsel  harmed,  rather than  helped,  his case.  Counsel  conducted  no \ninvestigation  into  the  shooting.  Instead,  he  directed  Redwine  to  obtain  his  own  witness  statements. \nCounsel  met with  Redwine  only twice.  Each visit  lasted  about  five minutes.  The  “meetings” were  held \nin  the  courtroom  while  counsel  was  handling  other cases.  In  spite  of Redwine’s  corroborated  account \nthat he  acted  in  self-defense,  counsel  did  not  interview a  single  witness  or  otherwise  investigate the \ndefense.  Counsel  also  refused  to  subpoena  any  law enforcement witnesses;  he  told  Redwine that  such \nsubpoenas  were  not  part of his job.  Counsel’s  failure  to pursue any  investigation  whatsoever  left him \ntotally  unfamiliar  with  the  facts  of his client’s  case. \nWhen Redwine and  his  sister  asked  counsel  whether  he  might pursue  a  self-defense justification \nfor the  killing,  counsel  advised them  that Mississippi  does  not  recognize  self-defense.’*  Instead,  counsel \n  \n'9  Counsel  was  either ignorant  of the  relevant  law,  or he  deliberately  misled  Redwine  in  order to \nconvince  him  to  plead  guilty.  See Homicide;  Justifiable  Homicide,  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  97-3-15  (e)  (f) \n(2000);  see  also  Ferrell  v.  State,  733  So.2d  788  (Miss.  1999)  (remanding  for a retrial  where  the  trial \ncourt’s jury  instruction inadequately  distinguished  between  manslaughter and justifiable  homicide  in  a \ncase  where  the victim  failed  to  heed  the  defendant’s  requests that he  leave his  property  and  the  defendant \nfired  warning  shots  into the  air  before the two  fought  and  the victim  was  shot). \n8 \n        \nwt \nrecommended that Redwine  plead  guilty to  manslaughter.  Counsel  scared  Redwine  into  believing that if \nhis  case  went to  trial  he  would  risk  life  in  prison  without parole.  Counsel  assured  Redwine that  pursuant \nto  the plea  agreement,  he would  serve  only  one year  in the  county  jail.  Although Redwine  does  not read \nwell,  his  lawyer never  read  the  plea  agreement to  him.  Out of fear that he  would  spend the  rest  of his  life \nin  prison,  and  relying  on  his  attorney’s  repeated  assurances  that he  would only  spend  one year  in jail  if he \naccepted the  plea,  Redwine  consented to the agreement.  Only  after  he  signed the  plea did  Redwine  lear \nthat counsel  was  seriously  mistaken:  he  was  sentenced to  fifteen years  in prison.  He  must  serve  eleven. \nSince  his  sentencing,  Redwine  has  never seen  nor  spoken  to  his attorney.  Redwine  is  not  familiar  with \nthe  post-conviction  review process and  has been  unable  to find counsel  to  represent  him  in  such \nproceedings  without a  fee. \nIn Redwine’s  case,  a  minimum  competent  defense  would  have  included:  investigation  of \nRedwine’s  claims  of self-defense,  including  interviews  with  witnesses and  inquiry  into  Shelton’s  history \nof harassing  Redwine;  counse}’s  familiarity with  the  law and defenses  applicable to  Redwine’s  case;  an \naccurate  explanation  to  Redwine of the  terms  of the  plea;  and an  honest assessment of the  risks  of \nconviction  at trial versus  accepting a  plea with a  lengthy prison  sentence. \nc.  Amicus  Diana  Brown  (Quitman  County):  Diana Brown  was  arrested  on October  31,  1997 \nand  was  released  on  bond  on  December 3,  1997.  In  February  1998,  Brown  learned  from  a  family  friend \nthat her  case  was  going  to the  grand jury.  She  contacted the court  and  learned  that the  court  had \nappointed  counsel.  She  looked  up  her attorney  in  the  phone  book and  called  his  office.  Counsel’s  staff \ntold  Brown  she could  not  speak to  her  lawyer,  but that counsel  was  aware  of her  case  and  would  see  her \nin  court,  Soon  thereafter,  Brown’s  bond  was  revoked  and  she was taken  back to jail.  Brown  did  not \nknow why  her bond  had  been revoked,  and  she had  no  contact with  counsel  prior to  being jailed. \nBrown  was  indicted  for  several  serious  crimes,  including  aggravated  assault and  driving  under \nthe  influence.  Two  days  later,  she  met  counsel  for the  first time  at the  courthouse.  Counsel  spoke  to \nBrown  and  about ten  other  defendants  as  a  group.  Counsel  read  the  charges  against  each  defendant  out \n  \n \naf  - \nloud  and  reported any  possible  plea agreement.  He  told  Brown  that  she was  facing  sixty years  or  more  in \nprison  if she were  to  be  convicted  at trial,  and  that the  state  was offering  a  plea of ten  years.  Counsel \ngave Brown  five  minutes to  decide on  the  plea;  when  she  asked  for time  to think about  it,  he  told  her that \nshe  was  guilty  and  her  best  bet  was  to  accept the  deal. \nBrown  was  never  able  to  discuss  her  case  privately with her  lawyer.  Counsel  never  asked her \nabout the  facts  of her  case.  For  example,  Brown  suffers from  polio  and  is  an  alcoholic.  Counsel  never \ninvestigated  whether these  would  be  mitigating factors  in  her  case.  Brown  accepted what  counsel \nrepresented  to  be a  ten-year  plea.  At her sentencing on  March  5,  1998,  Brown  learned  that  she  would \nreceive  ten  years  for  each  assault  charge,  for a  total  of thirty  years.  She was told  that  her ten-year \nsentences  would run  concurrently,  but no  one explained  what that  meant.  She  has  not  spoken  to  counsel \nsince  her  sentencing.  Brown  lacks  the  knowledge  to  pursue post-conviction  relief pro  se.  She  knows  of \nno attorney  who  is  available  to  help  her. \nAn  adequately-funded  defense  attorney  would  have:  met  with  Brown  before  she  was  indicted; \ndefended Brown  against bond  revocation;  arranged  a private  and  confidential  meeting with her to  discuss \nher case;  examined  the facts  of the  case  before  suggesting that  she plead  guilty;  considered  mitigating \ncircumstances  and  presented  them  in  her defense;  and  thoroughly  explained the terms  of the  plea and \nresulting  sentence. \n2.  Systemic  Absence  of Basic Defense  Services: \na.  Amicus  Willie  Henley  (Quitman  County):  Willie  Henley was  arrested  for burglary  in \nJanuary  1995,  He  was  indicted three weeks  later.  Henley met his court-appointed  lawyer  for  the  first, \nand  only,  time  at  his  arraignment,  after  he  had  spent  weeks  in jail.  Immediately Henley explained  to \ncounsel  that  the  house  he  had  allegedly  broken  into was  his  cousin’s  house  and that he  had  permission  to \nenter;  counsel  nevertheless  advised  Henley  to  plead  guilty.  Henley explained that  he  had  not  committed \na burglary  and  implored  his  lawyer  to  postpone the  arraignment until  Henley’s  cousin  returned  from  out \nof town  and  could  explain the  situation  to the  court.  Counsel  made  no  attempt  to  postpone  the \n10 \n   \na  -  7” \narraignment  and  did  not  advise  the  court  of Henley’s  defense  and  the  unavailability  of a critical  defense \nwitness.  Thanks  to the  efforts of Henley’s  family,  Henley’s cousin confirmed  his  account  at the \narraignment,  and  the judge  dismissed the  charges.  At the  very  least,  competent  counsel  would have \nasked the  court  for  a  continuance  in  order  to  insure  the  appearance of a critical  witness.  Instead, \nHenley’s charges  were  dismissed  only  because  of his  family’s  efforts. \nb.  Amicus  Carlos  Ivy (Union  County):  Carlos  Ivy,  then  only  fourteen years  old,  was  arrested  in \nAugust  1998  for the  robbery  of $100  from  an  elderly woman.  On  the night  of the  crime,  Ivy’s \ngrandmother,  Vera  Sanders,  overheard  Ivy’s  name  on  a  police  scanner.  The  police  said  he had  been \nspotted  wearing  a Dallas  Cowboys jacket  and  was  a  suspect  in the  robbery.  Sanders  immediately called \nthe  police  and  told them that they must  be mistaken:  although  Ivy  owned  a jacket with  the  same colors  as \nthe  Dallas  Cowboys’,  the jacket did  not  bear  the  team’s  name  or  logo,  and,  more  importantly,  was \nhanging  in  his  grandmother’s  closet  as  she  spoke.  Nonetheless,  Ivy was  arrested  for the crime  and was \ntaken  to jail.  After  Ivy’s  first  court-appointed  counsel  withdrew  because  of a  conflict  of interest,  the \ncourt  appointed  a  second  attorney. \nWhile  awaiting trial,  Ivy  was  verbally  and  physically abused by  law enforcement:  the jailers \nhoused  Ivy with  adult men,  and  sometimes threw  him  in  the  “drunk tank”  with  intoxicated  arrestees;  they \nbeat  him on  more  than  one  occasion;  they  sprayed him  with water  hoses  and  with  mace;  and  they \ndeprived  him  of food  and  water.  The jailers  also  stripped  Ivy  and  made  him  sleep  naked  in  his  cell for \nfour nights.  Ivy’s  lawyer  never made  any attempt to  protect  him  from the  abuse.  In  fact,  Ivy’s \ngrandmother tried  in vain  to  contact his  attorney  weekly  during the  year  Ivy was  held  in the  county jail. \nHe never  returned  her calls.  After the  stripping  incident,  Ivy’s  grandmother,  then  desperate,  contacted \nthe  FBI  and  the United  States  Attorney  General.  Only after federal  officers  intervened  did  Ivy’s jailers \ncease  abusing him. \nMeanwhile,  Ivy’s court-appointed  lawyer  provided no  defense  services:  counsel conducted  no \ninvestigation,  interviewed  no  witnesses (not  even Ivy’s  grandmother)  and  made  no  attempt to  prepare  for \n11\n“  ~~ &  ~ \ntrial.  Later,  Ivy  learned that the  State’s  principal  witness  against  him  was  charged  with  a  felony  and  had \nbeen  threatened by  the  authorities  with the  removal  of her  children  if she  did  not  testify  against  Ivy. \nWhen counsel  recommended  that Ivy  plead  guilty  to  burglary  of a  dwelling  and  robbery,  Ivy \naccepted  the  plea  in  part because  he  was  desperate  to  leave the  county jail.  Counsel  assured  him  that  if \nhe  accepted  the plea,  he  would  be  eligible  for  parole  after  six years.  Although  he  was  only  fifteen  when \nhe  pled,  Ivy’s  grandmother,  his  legal  guardian,  was  never  notified  when  his  plea  and  sentencing hearing \nwould take  place;  therefore,  she  was not present at  either hearing.  Only  after  he  accepted  the  plea  did  Ivy \nlearn that ten years  of his  twelve-year  sentence  are  mandatory. \nAn  adequate  defense  system  would  have  insured that:  Ivy  had  access  to  his  lawyer before  his \ncourt hearings  and  while  he  was  incarcerated;  counsel  would  have  consulted  Ivy’s  legal  guardian  about \nmajor  decisions  in  his  case;  the  circumstances  of the allegations  were  investigated;  Ivy  and  his \ngrandmother  were  accurately  and  carefully  apprised  of the  terms  of the  plea offer,  and  counsel  would \nhave  been  prepared  to  go to  trial  had  Ivy  elected  to  do  so. \nc.  Amicus Walter Williams  (Quitman  County):  Walter  Williams  was  arrested  for  murder on \nJanuary  1,  1998  and released  on  bond  on  January  24,  1998.  He  was  not  appointed  an  attorney  until \nAugust  13,  1998,  the  day  of his  arraignment.  At that time,  counsel  directed  Williams  to  obtain  his  own \nstatements  from  potential  witnesses  and pursue  his  own  investigation.  Williams eventually  quit  his job at \na  local  farm  so  he  could  devote  his  time  to  investigating  his  case.  At trial,  Williams  was  convicted  of \nmurder  and  sentenced to  life  in  prison.  Williams  has  not seen  his  lawyer  since  the trial.  Counsel  wrote a \nletter  to  Williams  informing  him  that an  appeal  had  been  filed  in  his  case,  but  Williams  has  no \ninformation  about the  grounds  of the  appeal  or  its  outcome. \nSince  June  1999,  Williams  has  been  trying to  obtain  post-conviction  relief.  First,  he  tried  to \nobtain  documents  from  counsel.  In  response  to Williams’s  request,  his  lawyer wrote:  “This \nacknowledges  receipt  of your  letter.  ..wherein you  requested  copies  of your  file.  I  will  be  unable  to \nforward these to you  since  I  have  no  expense  fund  with  which  to do  so.”  Williams  contacted  the \n12\n \n 6=\nMississippi  Bar Association  and was  informed that an  attorney  is required to  send a  client his  file. \nWilliams  is unable to  seek post-conviction  relief without  access  to  his  files  and  the  assistance  of an \nattorney. \nA  basic  defense  in  Williams’s  case  should  have  included:  timely  appointment of counsel; \ncounsel’s  routine  pre-trial  consultation  with  Williams;  reasonable,  professional  investigation  of the  facts \nof the  case,  rather than  Williams’s  amateur attempts  to  investigate  his  own  case;  counsel’s  explanation  of \nthe  status  of Williams’s  direct  appeal;  counsel’s  providing  Williams with  a copy  of his  file  to  enable \nWilliams to  pursue  post-conviction  relief. \nd. Amicus James  Borgmann  (Forrest  County):  James  Borgmann  was  charged  with  the  rape  of \nthe  daughter-in-law of a well-known  local  family,  at the  University of Southern Mississippi  campus.  The \nvictim  identified  Borgmann  as  the  rapist.  At Borgmann’s  first court  appearance, he  was  appointed  an \nattorney.  He  was  not arraigned  until  six  months  later.  Even  though  Borgmann  claimed  he  was  innocent \nand  provided  an  alibi  as  well  as  a  list of witnesses,  counsel  conducted  no  investigation  and made  no \neffort  to confirm the  alibi.  Counsel  spoke  to  Borgmann  only  a couple  of times  while  he  was  in jail.  The \nState  had  offered  Borgmann  a deal  whereby  he  would  serve  ten  years  if he pled  guilty.  Counsel  was \nsuspicious  of this  offer  because  it  seemed  lenient given  the  nature  of the  alleged  crime.  Still,  he \nconducted  no  investigation.  Finally,  in November  of 1999,  counsel  overheard the  D.A.  say  that the \nState’s  DNA test had  exonerated  Borgmann  as the  rapist.  As  a result  of the  State’s  DNA test,  Borgmann \nwas  cleared  of the  charges  in  November  1999.  He  had  spent  nine months  in  detention. \nWith  adequate  resources,  Borgmann’s  lawyer would  have  been  able  to:  1)  investigate  the  facts  of \nthe  case;  2)  obtain  independent  blood  tests;  3)  schedule  a preliminary  hearing to  explore  any  problems \nwith  the  identification of Borgmann;  and 4)  file  a  motion to  compel  discovery,  which might have caused \nthe  government to  release  the  DNA results  sooner. \n3.  Systemic  Breakdown: \n13 \n  \n \na.  Amicus Donald  Staten  (Quitman  County):  Donald  Staten  turned  himself in  to  police  on  a \nburglary charge  in  March  1996.  The  next day,  he  appeared  before a judge.  At the  hearing,  the judge \nadvised  Staten  of his  right to  an  attorney,  but no  one  was appointed.  Instead, the  court ordered  Staten  to \nparticipate  ina  program,  pursuant  to  which  he would  participate  in  a work  detail  during the  time  he  was \nincarcerated,  Staten  completed  the  program  and was released  from  custody on  September  27,  1996. \nStaten  was  convicted,  and  incarcerated  for  six  months,  without  the  assistance  of counsel. \nHad  Staten  been  charged  in  a jurisdiction  with  adequately-funded  indigent  defense  services,  he \nnever  would  have  been  convicted  and  sentenced to  a prison  term  without the  assistance  of counsel. \nb.  Amicus  Milas McDonald  (Harrison  County): \nMilas  McDonald was  arrested  for  burglary  in  1995.  He made  his  first court appearance  on  July \n27,  1995.  At this  hearing,  he  was  represented  by  a public defender  who  handled  only  initial  appearances. \nAt  some  point  during  his  pre-trial  incarceration,  while  he  was  without  a court  appointed  attorney, \nMcDonald  was transferred  to  state  prison  after an  erroneous  notation  in  his  file  showed that  he  had \nalready  been  convicted.  McDonald was  not appointed  a  lawyer  until December  13,  1995.  The  first  two \nlawyers  appointed to McDonald’s case  were  unable  to  represent him  because  of conflicts of interest.  In \nJune  1996,  a third  attorney  was  appointed  to  handle McDonald’s  case.  McDonald’s  lawyer  never \ncontacted  McDonald  and took no  action  on  his  behalf.  McDonald  had  no  way of reaching his  attorney. \nHe had no  money  for  stamps to  send a letter,  and  the  county’s  appointed  attorneys,  including \nMcDonald’s,  did  not accept their clients’  collect calls  because  the county  did  not reimburse  them  for \nsuch  expenses.  In  August  1996,  McDonald  requested  a  new  attorney  because  his  lawyer had  not \ncontacted  him.  His request was  denied.  At that time,  an  attorney who  happened to  be  in the  court room \nwhile  McDonald  was  making  his  request told  McDonald  he  would  handle  his case  without  charge.  Soon \nthereafter,  the  case  against  McDonald  was  dismissed.  By  that time,  McDonald  had  spent eighteen \nmonths  in  the judicial  system  without representation. \n14\n°  ‘  ©  *  ©  © \nMcDonald’s  case  illustrates  several  shortcomings  of Mississippi’s  approach  to  indigent  defense: \n1) the  failure  to  provide  counsel  in a timely  fashion;  2)  defendants’  lack of meaningful  access to  their \nlawyers;  3)  cases  dragging  on for  months,  or even,  as  in this  case,  over  a year,  before  they are  resolved. \nSuch  inefficient resolution taxes  defendants and  the  counties  forced  to  detain  them  in jail  for extended \nperiods  of time.  In  an  adequately  funded  defense  system,  McDonald  would  have  met with  his  attorney \nwithin  a  reasonable time  after his  arrest;  he  would  have  been  able  to  contact his  attorney;  and  his  case \nwould  have  been  resolved  competently  and  efficiently with the  assistance  of counsel. \nCONCLUSION \nMississippi’s  failure  to  provide  funds  for  indigent  defense  services  has  produced  a  statewide \ncrisis  in the  delivery  of such  services.  Amici’s  experiences,  typical  of indigent  defendants  across  the \nstate,  show  that the  current county-funded  systems  fall  far short  of constitutional  standards.  The  State’s \nfiscal  support  of indigent  defense  is  at the  crux  of any  remedial  effort.  Presently,  the  State  refuses  to \nprovide  the  support.  Quitman  County  should  be  allowed  to  pursue  this  action  to  compel  the  State  to  bear \nits  fiscal  responsibility to  make the  right to  counsel  meaningful  to  Mississippi’s  poorest  citizens. \n— \n\\  TiV  eoadb on \n Joseph  P.

Experience  demonstrates  that  the  system of justice \nruns  more  effectively  with  a  full-time  public  defender  office. \nBACKGROUND \nQuitman,  Noxubee,  Jefferson,  Claiborne,  Wilkinson,  Lauderdale,  Pike,  Holmes, \nCoahoma,  and  Forrest  Counties  each have  public  defenders  who  are  employed  on a  part- \ntime  or contractual  basis,  or  have  systems  where  private  attorneys  are  appointed  on  a \ncase-by-case  basis.  Hinds  County  formerly  had  a  system  of case-by-case  appointments \nof counsel  for indigent  defendants,  and  since  1991  has  had  a  full-time  public  defender \noffice.  The  public  defender  system in  each  of the  counties  is  operated  on  a  county  level. \nEach  of the  amici  are  sheriffs  of their respective  counties  charged with  enforcement of \nthe  law.\nARGUMENT \nI.  A FULL-TIME  PUBLIC  DEFENDER  OFFICE  IS  AN  INTEGRAL \nPART  OF  THE  FAIR,  EFFECTIVE  AND  EFFICIENT \nADMINISTRATION  OF  JUSTICE  AND  EASES  THE  BURDEN  ON \nLAW  ENFORCEMENT  OFFICIALS \nBy  its  nature,  a  full-time  public  defender office,  such  as  the  one  the  Mississippi \nLegislature  authorized  in  the  Mississippi  Statewide  Public  Defender  System  Act  of  1998, \nforms  an  integral  part of the  system  of justice.  See  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§  25-32-33.”  If the \nindigent  defense  function  is  inadequate,  every  other  component  of the  system  necessarily \nmust  find  a way  to  compensate  for  such  inadequacies.  Law  enforcement  in  particular is \nadversely  impacted  because,  among  other reasons,  indigent  defendants  unable  to  make \nbail,  or who  do  not  receive  a  speedy  trial,  languish  in  often  overcrowded  county jails \nwaiting  for the  resolution  of their  cases.  The  failure  of the  indigent  defense  system  can \ncreate  a  situation  in which  counsel  is  not  appointed  until  late  in  the  process,  thus  causing \ndelay  and  potentially  hindering  chances  of obtaining  a  conviction.  Moreover,  delay \nmeans  a waste  of resources.  Sheriffs  are  often  forced  to  adjust  the  expenditure  of funds \nand,  more  importantly,  other valuable  resources  supposedly  earmarked  for  enforcement \nactivities  to  ensure  that  these  additional  indigent  defendants  are  monitored  in  the  county \nsystem,  even  where  such defendants  belong  in  the  state  penitentiary,  should  have been \nreleased  because  of innocence,  or  end  up  serving  more  time  waiting  for  the  disposition  of \nthe  case  against  them  than  they  actually  receive  in  sentencing. \n  \n*  No  funding  was  provided  for  implementation  of the  Mississippi  Statewide  Public \nDefender  Act  of 1998.  The  statute  has  since  been  repealed. \n \nA  clear  demarcation  of duties  among  law  enforcement,  prosecutors,  and  public \ndefenders  means  the  system  as  a whole  benefits.  In  contrast,  the  system  deteriorates  on \nall  fronts  where  any  one  component  falls  short  of its  constitutional  obligations.  The \ninstitution  of a  viable  public  defender  system  will promote  public  confidence  in  the \nMississippi  system  of justice,  which  in  turn  will  promote  greater confidence  and \ncommunity  cooperation  in  law  enforcement  efforts. \nII.  THE  EXPERIENCE  OF  HINDS  COUNTY  DEMONSTRATES  THAT  A \nFULL-TIME  PUBLIC  DEFENDER  OFFICE  FACILITATES  THE  FAIR, \nEFFICIENT  AND  EFFECTIVE  ADMINISTRATION  OF  JUSTICE \nThe  experience  of Hinds  County,  which  has  a  full-time public  defender’s  office, \ndemonstrates  that  the  availability and  experience  of the  staff of a  full-time  public \ndefender  office  facilitates  the  fair,  efficient,  and  effective  administration of justice.  The \nprosecutor’s  office  and  the  public  defender  office  represent,  respectively,  the  interests  of \nthe  state  in  securing  a  conviction  and  the  interests  of indigent  defendants  in protecting \ntheir  constitutional  rights;  together these,  along  with  other concerns,  compose  the \ninterests  of the  citizens  of the  State  of Mississippi  in  a  fair,  efficient,  and  effective  system \nof justice.  The  relationship  created  by  an  effective  prosecutor  and  an  effective  public \ndefender  in  any  given matter  promotes  the  public  interest  and  the  public  trust  in  the \nsystem.  This  permits  Sheriff McMillin  of Hinds  County  to  focus  on  the  designated \nactivities  of law  enforcement personnel  without  being  diverted  by the problems  of \nindigent  defendants,  which problems  are  ably  attended  by  their  counsel.  The  full-time \nstaff of the  Hinds  County public  defender  office  is  composed  of committed  and \nexperienced professionals  who  are  not  distracted  by  the  competing  responsibilities \nsimilarly  situated part-time  public  defenders  owe  to  their  clients  in  civil,  and  even  other \n \ncriminal  matters,  in  which  they  are  privately retained  as  counsel.  The  unique problems \nindigent  defendants  face  cannot  be  addressed  adequately  by  part-time  counsel  without \nresources  to  support  their  own  investigation  and  defense.  As  Sheriff McMillin  is \nuniquely  aware,  it  is  precisely because  of the  presence  and  experience  of the  full-time \npublic  defenders that  potential  problems  are resolved  quickly  and  efficiently.  The \ninterests  and  efforts  of the public  defenders  are  balanced by  those  of the prosecutors,  who \nhave  the  resources  to devote  to  the pursuit  of criminal  defendants.  This  creates  a  system \nthat  functions  fairly  smoothly.  . \nAmong  other things,  the  full-time  defenders  in  Hinds  County help  ensure  that \ncounsel  is  appointed  early  and  present  at  the  appropriate  stages  of the  proceedings;  that \ncases  lacking  sufficient  evidence  are  dismissed  quickly  instead  of taking  valuable  time  on \nthe  docket;  that  defendants  are  given  appropriate bail  options,  thus  reducing  the  costs  of \nimprisoning  more pre-trial  detainees  than  necessary;  and  that  cases  continue  to  move \nthrough  the  system  rather than remain  on  the  docket  indefinitely  due  to  counsel  who  is \nill-prepared  to  proceed. \nThe  presence  of full-time public  defenders  also  helps  to  promote judicial respect \nfor the  many  complex  and  delicately balanced  decisions  that  law  enforcement  agents \nmake  in  the  course  of an  investigation,  arrest  and  disposition  of a case.  With  the  added \nexperience  of effective,  full-time  public  defenders  who  are  as  essential  to  the  system  as \nexperienced  prosecutors  and law  enforcement  officials,  the  question  of effective \nassistance  of counsel  is  no  longer  a  distraction with which the  court  must  concern  itself. \nOnce  the  court is  assured  that  an  indigent  defendant has  been  provided  with  adequate \ncounsel,  the  court  1s  less  likely  to  engage  in  second-guessing  of law  enforcement  matters \n   \nthat  require  the  effective  advocacy  of counsel,  such  as  questions  regarding  the  proper \nexclusion  or  admissibility  of evidence,  voluntariness  of a confession,  and  knowledge  and \nunderstanding of plea  arrangements. \nIl.  ©THE  EXPERIENCE  OF  THE  SHERIFFS  OF  COUNTIES  IN  WHICH \nINDIGENT  DEFENDANTS  ARE  REPRESENTED  BY  PART-TIME \nPUBLIC  DEFENDERS  DEMONSTRATES  THE  BURDEN IMPOSED \nON  SHERIFFS  AND  THE  NEED  FOR A FULL-TIME  PUBLIC \nDEFENDER  OFFICE \nIn  contrast,  the  burden  imposed  on  the  sheriffs  of Quitman  and  seventy-eight \nother counties  —  where  public  defenders  are  employed  on  a part-time  or  contractual  basis, \nor  attorneys  are  appointed  on  a case-by-case  basis  —  handicaps  law  enforcement \nofficials.  While  there  is  a  single  office  these  sheriffs  can  call  when  they  need  to  speak \nwith  a prosecutor,  there  is  no  single  defender  office  to  call  when  a problem  arises  that \ndefense  counsel  can  help  to  solve.  The justice  systems  in  these  counties  often  move  more \nslowly  because  there  are  no  full-time  public  defenders.  Consequently,  sheriffs  house \npretrial  detainees  far  longer  than  is  necessary,  particularly where  these  detainees  belong \nin  the  state  penitentiary,  should  be  released  because  of innocence,  or  end  up  serving more \ntime  in  pretrial  detention  than  they  ultimately  receive  when  their  cases  are  finally \nresolved.  These  sheriffs  expend  too  much  time  and  effort  resolving  the  problems  raised \nby  the  presence  of the  many  indigent  defendants  mired  in  the  system  without  adequate \nrepresentation.  These  problems  include  unpredictable  and  unforeseeable  costs  and \nresources  that  must  be  devoted to  the  detention  of indigent defendants,  the  obligation  to \nkeep  cases  moving  through  the judicial  system  without  counsel  prepared  and  available to \ndo  so,  and  the  overall  difficulty  of obtaining  cooperation  from  unresponsive  counsel\nunable  to  devote  time  and  resources  of her  own  to  the  representation  of such  indigent \ndefendants. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  set  forth  herein,  the  experience  of Hinds  County,  with  its  full-time \npublic  defender  office,  contrasted  with  the  experiences  of Quitman,  Noxubee,  Jefferson, \nClaiborne,  Wilkinson,  Lauderdale,  Pike,  Holmes,  Coahoma,  and  Forrest  Counties,  in \nwhich  there  is  no  full-time public  defender  office,  demonstrates  that  a  full-time  public \ndefender office  is  an  integral  part  of a fair,  effective,  and  efficient  system  of justice  in  the \nState  of Mississippi. \n   \nRespectfully  submitted, \n     \nGniffin Jones \nJONES  AND  FUNDERBURK \n$13  North  State  Street \nJackson,  MS  39236 \n(610)  355-5200 \nEverett  T.

DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS, \nVS. \nQUITMAN  COUNTY,  MISSISSIPPI  PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE. \n  \nOn  Appeal  from  the  Circuit  Court  In  and For  Quitman  County,  Mississippi‘ \nI.  A  STATE-FUNDED  FULL-TIME  PUBLIC  DEFENDER  OFFICE \nWOULD  INCREASE  THE  DEPENDABILITY  OF  THE  CRIMINAL \nJUSTICE  SYSTEM  IN  MISSISSIPPI \nThe  criminal justice  system  is  founded  on  two  basic  tenants:  (1)  Accountability \nand  (2) Due Process.  As  officers  of the  court  and  as  public  officials,  prosecutors  are \nconcemed  about  both  of these  tenants.  First,  prosecutors  have  a  responsibility  to  hold \nindividuals  accountable  for  criminal  activity  and  thus  to  protect  the public  both  by \nremoving  guilty  defendants  from  the  streets  and  by  providing  deterrence  for  other  would- \nbe  criminals.  Notably,  this  duty  subsumes  a duty  no?  to  convict  and  incarcerate  innocent \ndefendants.  Second,  and  not  so  apparent,  prosecutors  have  a  responsibility  to  uphold  the \nintegrity  of the  system.  This  requires  prosecutors  to  respect  the  defendants’ \nconstitutional  rights  to  due process,  including  where appropriate:  lawful  searches  and \nseizures  based  upon  lawful  probable  case;  lawful  reading  of their rights  before  lawful \ndetention  and/or  interrogation;  speedy  arraignment  and  trial;  and  lawful  access  to  a \ncompetent  and  adequate  defense  lawyer and  an  appeal.  If any  of these  basic\nconstitutionally  mandated  rights  are  violated,  it  is  the prosecutor’s  as  well  as  defender’s \nduty  to  the  Court  and  public  to  evaluate whether  a  conviction  based  on  unlawfully \nobtained  evidence  is  appropriate. \nIn  Stringer v.  State,  500  So.  2d  928  (Miss.  1987),  the  Mississippi  Supreme  Court \nadmonished  that  all  prosecutors  are: \nduty  bound  and  swom  by  oath  to  uphold  the  laws  of  the \nState  of  Mississippi.  We  are  thus  entrusted  with  the \nresponsibility  of ensuring  that  the  criminal justice  system  of \nthis  State  works  to  guarantee  that  every  defendant  brought \nbefore  its  tribunals  receive  a fair  and impartial  trial. \né \nStringer,  500  So.  2d  at  930  (emphasis  added).  In  Stringer,  this  Court  reversed  a  death \npenalty  sentence  and  made  very  clear that  prosecutors  and  trial judges,  as  well  as  defense \ncounsel,  have  solemn  responsibility  to  be mindful  of the  defendant’s  rights  to  due  and  fair \nprocess.’  This  responsibility  necessarily  becomes  heightened  when  the  prosecutor  is \naware  that  defense  counsel  has  inadequate  resources  to  provide  constitutionally  effective \n‘assistance  of counsel.  It  is  axiomatic  that  without  effective  assistance  of defense  counsel \nthe  likelihood  of conviction  of an  innocent  defendant  increases  dramatically.  Ineffective \nassistance  of defense  counsel  also  increases  the  likelihood  that  illegally  obtained \nevidence  can be  used  against  a  defendant  whose  lawyer  did  not  have  the  time,  resources, \nor competence  to  move  to  exclude  such  evidence.  This  ultimately  undermines  the \ncredibility  of the  system  of law  enforcement  in  general.  For these  reasons,  every \n  \nSee also Romiley v.  Superior  Court of Maricopa  County,  891  P.2d  246,  250  (Ariz.  1995). \n(“The  prosecutor speaks not solely for the  victim,  or the  police,  or those  who  support  them,  but \nfor all  the  People.  That body  of “The  People”  includes  the  defendant and  his  family and  those \nwho  care  about him.”); Mississippi Judicial Performance  Commission  v.  Hopkins,  590  So.  2d  857 \n(Miss.  1991)  (reminding prosecutors  of their special  duty  to defendants  and  the  system). \n  \n \nprosecutor  in  Mississippi  has  a unique  interest  in  ensuring  that  indigent  defendants  in \nparticular  are  represented  by  competent  and  constitutionally  effective  counsel. \nA.  The  Current  Method  Of Funding  The  Criminal  Justice  System \nIn  Mississippi  Results  In  Highly  Disparate  Resources  Of The \nProsecAundt iDeofenns e \n  \nIn Mississippi,  the  State  provides  the  lion’s  share  of funding  for  all  prosecution \nefforts.  The  State  delegates  to  the  counties  the  responsibility  to  hire  and  pay  for  county \nprosecutors.  These  county  prosecutors  are  responsible  only  for  misdemeanors  and \nsometimes  the  very preliminary  stages  of felony  cases.  However,  the  primarily  State- \nfunded District  Attorneys  Office  steps  in  to  prosecute  all  felony  cases  after  arraignment. \nMoreover,  the  100%  State-funded  Attorney  General’s  office  steps  in  to  handle  all  appeals \nof felony  convictions  in  the  State.  The  District  Attorneys  Office  is  staffed  with  full-time \ncriminal  prosecutors  who  are  prohibited  from  taking  other  legal work  while  employed  as \nState  prosecutors.  This  prohibition  ensures  that prosecutors  are  never  incentivized  to \nspend  less  time  on their public  caseload  in  order to  make  money  representing  private \nclients. \nIn  addition,  the  State  provides  full-time  Investigators  to  each  District  Attorneys’ \nOffice  in  Mississippi  and funds  100%  of the  State  Crime  Lab’s  annual  budget.  The  State \nCrime  Lab,  which  is  available  to  all  state  prosecutors,  without  prior  leave  of court,  has \nstate-of-the-art technology  for blood  and  DNA  analysis,  gunpowder  analysis, \nfingerprinting  and  handwniting  analysis  (to  name just  a  small  sample  of its  capabilities). \nIn  sharp  contrast,  the  Quitman  County  public  defenders  who  represent  indigent \ndefendants  against  these  State-paid  prosecutors  are  paid  a  substandard  living  wage  of \n516,200  a year  for their  services.  Consequently,  the  Quitman  County  public  defenders \n \nmust  take  on  substantial  additional  private  employment  to  make  a  living.  Quitman \nCounty’s  public  defenders  are  not provided  with  any  of the  resources  provided  to  State \nprosecutors.  Rather,  the  “part-time” public  defenders  are  expected  to  find,  fund,  and  staff \ntheir  own  office  accommodations  and  research  facilities.  While  they  have  limited  hours \nof access  to  public  libraries,  it  is  unrealistic  to  expect  Quitman  County  public  defenders \nto  drive  hours  each  time  they  need  access  to  State-funded  public  resources.  In  short,  the \ncurrent  system,  under  which  the  State  funds  most  of the  prosecution  efforts  and  only \nplans  to  fund  defense  efforts  in  capital  cases,  results  in  a  huge  disparity  of resources \nbetween  the  State-funded  prosecution  and  the  county-funded  defense.  This  result  is \ninevitable  in poor rural  counties  such  as  Quitman  which  have  very  little  money  and  are \nthus  forced  either to  forego  other necessary  services  raise  county  taxes  to  support  such \nactivities,  or  inevitably,  to  under-fund  their  public  defender  programs. \nIndeed,  this  Court  repeatedly  has  recognized  the  seriousness  of the  disparity  in \nresources  caused by  county-funded  public  defenders  and  this  Court  has  urged  the  State  to \nimplement  a  State  wide  public  defender  system  to  ensure  that  defendants  receive \neffective  assistance  of counsel  regardless  of the  financial  plight  of the  county  in  which \nthey  are  tried.  See  e.g.,  Mease  v.  State,  583  So.  2d  1283,  1285  (Miss.  1991)  (“the \nproblem  of indigent  representation  [should  be  addressed]  on  a  statewide  basis,  rather  than \nthrust.  .  .  on  financially-strapped  counties”);  Wilson  v.  State,  574  So.  2d  1338,  1341 \n(Miss.  1990)  (questioning  State  decision  to  fund prosecution  and  not  defense).  As  public \nservants,  prosecutors  have  the  same  interest  in  the  overall  integrity  and  dependability  of \nthe  system  as  this  Court.  Regrettably,  the  “real-life”  result  under  Mississippi’s  current \nfunding  scheme  is  that  part-time  over-burdened  and  under-compensated  public  defenders: \n  \n \noften  are  not  aware  of recent  legal  authority;  rarely  hire  investigators  or  utilize  forensic \nexpertise;  may  spend  insufficient  time  interviewing  and  counseling their clients;  and  as  a \nresult  clients  are  often  forced to  enter plea  agreements  and  consequently  may  be  unable  to \nprovide  constitutionally  adequate  assistance  of counsel.  As  prosecutors  in  Mississippi, \namici  have  seen  these  results  first-hand  and  are  intimately  aware  of the  difference  State- \nfunded  full-time  representatives  would  make. \nB.  Prosecutors  Are  Not  Just  Advocates,  But  Are  “Ministers  Of \nJustice”  With  Special  Duties  To  Ensure  Defendants  Receive \nEffective Assistance of Counsel \nAs  an  officer both  of the  Court  and  the  State,  every prosecutor  in  the  State  of \nMississippi  must  take  a  special  oath  of office  and  solemnly  swear  (or  affirm)  to  faithfully \nsupport  the  Constitution  of the  United  States  and  Constitution  of the  State  of Mississippi. \nMoreover,  each  such prosecutor then  becomes  bound  by  several  codes  of ethical  conduct, \nincluding  the  Mississippi  Rules  of Professional  Conduct,  “Special  Responsibilities  of a \nProsecutor.”  The  Federal  and  State  Constitutions  as  well  as  each  of the  ethical  cannons \nof professional  responsibility  to  which  prosecutors  are  bound  require  them  to  be  mindful \nof defendants’  rights  —  including  their  Constitutional  right  to  receive  effective  assistance \nof defense  counsel.  The  official commentary  to  the  Mississippi  Rules  regulating \nprosecutors  sets  forth  that: \nA  prosecutor  has  the  responsibility  of  a  minister  of justice \nand  not  simply  that  of  an  advocate.  This  responsibility \ncarries  with  it  specific  obligations  to  see  that  the  defendant \nis  accorded procedural justice. \n   \nComment,  Mississippi  Rules  of Court,  Rule  38.  Special  Responsibilities  of a  Prosecutor \n(2001)  (emphasis  added).* \nThis  express  duty  to  look  out  for  the  public  defenders’  clients  puts  prosecutors  in \nan  untenable  situation  when  defendants  are  not  provided  with  effective  assistance  of \ndefense  counsel.  When  defense  counsel  does  not  provide  adequate,  competent  assistance, \nthe  prosecution  is  not  free  to  zealously  present  the  State’s  case,  confident  that  the  defense \nwill  zealously  and  competently present  its  case and  the Jury  will  make  an  informed \ndecision.  Rather,  when  defense  counsel  is  burdened  with  too  great  a  caseload,  inadequate \n_  (or no)  staffing  and  administrative  support,  inadequate  compensation  and  resources, \nand/or  a  lack  of proper  training  and  supervision,  the  prosecution  must  step  in  and  be  both \nprosecutor  and  defender. \nOf course,  the  overriding  reasons  the  prosecutor  must  be  mindful  that  the \ndefendant  is  receiving  effective  assistance  of counsel  is  to  reduce  the  likelihood  that  an \ninnocent  defendant  is  convicted.  However,  prosecutors  are  constantly  aware  of at  least \ntwo  other  very  pertinent  reasons  effective  assistance  of defense  counsel  is  essential. \nFirst,  the  public’s  faith  in  the  system  depends  on  strict  adherence  to  the  due  process  rights \nof every  defendant.  When  defense  lawyers  do  not  challenge  illegal  searches  and  seizures \nor  unlawful  confessions,  every  individual’s  constitutional  rights  are  diminished  at  that \nmoment.  Second,  when  prosecutors  secure  convictions  against  counsel  that are \nconstitutionally  inadequate, there  often  is  an  enormous  waste  of resources when  the \n  \nMississippi  Prosecutors  are also bound  to  the National  District Attomeys  Association \nProsecution  Standards  and the ABA  Standards  for Criminal  Justice,  each of which  are  devoted \nexclusively to criminal justice and the heightened  ethical  standards  to  which  criminal  prosecutors \nshould adhere.  These  cannons  also  stress a prosecutor’s  duties  to the  Court,  the public  and  due \nprocess.\nmatter  is  taken  on  appeal.  The  unworkability  of this  situation  1s  obvious  and  cannot  be \nsustained  long  term.  Yet,  this  untenable  result  is  exactly what  now  exists  in  counties \nthroughout  Mississippi  which  cannot  afford to  adequately  compensate  public  defenders, \nwho  in  turn  must  maintain  substantial  private practices  and  often  spend  significantly  less \ntime  and  resources  on  their  indigent  defense  cases. \nMoreover,  as public  servants,  prosecutors  generally  enjoy  special  deference  from \njurors  who  are  comfortable  with  the  “knowledge”  that  it  would  be  highly  unlikely  for  the \npolice  and  prosecution  to  be  pursuing  conviction  without  very  good  cause.  Even  though \njurors  are  clearly  instructed  that  a  defendant’s  guilt  must be  demonstrated  “beyond  a \nreasonable  doubt,”  if an  indigent  defendant  is  provided  an  ineffective  lawyer  who  does \nnot  pursue  forensic  evidence,  potential  witnesses  and  alibis,  the jury  is  likely  to  go  with \nits  gut  instinct  and  assume  the  prosecution has  a  good  case.  Again,  no  prosecutor wants  a \nconviction  that  is  not  based  on  a  real  showing  of evidence  establishing  guilt  beyond  a \nreasonable  doubt. \nU1.  A  STATE-FUNDED  FULL-TIME  PUBLIC  DEFENDER  OFFICE \nWOULD  REDUCE  FISCAL  WASTE  BY  INCREASING  THE \nLIKELIHOOD  THAT  DEFENDANTS  MOVE  THROUGH  THE \n-  IVE,  TI  A \nBecause prosecutors  are  mindful  of their  duties  to  the  court,  public,  and  even  to \nthe  defendant,  when  resources  are  highly  disparate  they  must  spend  more  time  evaluating \nthe  defense’s  case  and  cannot  focus  on prosecution.  Being  a  successful  prosecutor  is  not \nto  “win  a  case,  but  [to  ensure}  that justice  [is]  done.” Berger  v.  United States,  295  U.S. \n78-88  (1935).  Given  the burdens  placed  on  law  enforcement  to  make  quick  arrests when \ncrimes  are  committed,  the  natural  desire of potential  witnesses  to  want  criminal \n  \n \naccountability,  and  the  incentives  often  placed  on  persons  with  criminal  records  to  “make \ndeals,”  inevitably  in  some  cases  the  wrong  person  will  be  tried  on  criminal  charges. \nIt  is  never  a  state  prosecutor’s job  or  desire  to  convict  the  wrong  person. \nAccordingly,  when  defendants  are  represented  by  counsel  with  inadequate  resources  or \ntime  to  explore  every  possible  defense,  interview potential  witnesses,  and  evaluate \nwhether there  are  procedural  grounds  for dismissal,  the  prosecution  also  must  fill  the  role \nof assistant  defense  counsel.  This  takes  time,  resources  and  energy  away  from  the \nprosecutor’s  duty  to  represent  the  state  zealously  in prosecuting.  If the  State  implements \na  State-funded  full-time  public  defender  office,  and prosecutors  throughout  the  State  can \nfocus  on  presenting  their  cases,  ultimately,  this  would  save  the  State  enormous  resources. \nOver the  years  we  personally  have  regretted  the  resources  wasted  both  when  cases  are \nreversed  on  appeal  because  of ineffective  counsel  and  even  more  frequently  when  cases \nare  given  extra  scrutiny by the  appellate  courts  because  of questionable  assistance  of \n‘counsel,  even  when  ultimately  found  “harmless.”\nCONCLUSION \nAs  set  forth :bove,  ]  unqualifiedly submit that  a Stete-finded full-time Public \nDetender’s Office iz  in the  best interest of every prosecutor in Mississippi,  as  well  as in \nthe  best interest of the Courts, defendants  tried on criminal charges,  financially-strappod \ncounties currently finding  indigent defense, underpaid and over-burdened public \ndefenders,  and the public  at large. \nDated:  Apr  18, 2001 \nJ, \n:  f \nP.O.

IN SUPPORT\nI OF APPELLANT QUITMAN COUNTY\nAs experienced Mississippi law enforcement officials charged with the\nI\nresponsibility of supervising law enforcement efforts of each of their respective counties,\nI\namici are particularly well-suited to address whether a statewide and state funded full-\nI time public defender system is necessary for the fair, efficient and effective\nadministration of justice, and whether the implementation of such a full-time system\ni\nwould further public confidence in law enforcement. Amici are uniquely positioned to\nI attest to the virtues of a system with a full-time public defender office, as compared to\none where public defenders represent indigent defendants on:a part-time or contract basis.\nI\nExperience demonstrates that the system of justice is more effective with a full-time\nI\npublic defender office.\nI\ni\n\nl ;\nI\ni Adams, Bolivar, Claibome, Coahoma, Covington, Holmes, Humphreys,\nJefferson, Jefferson Davis, Lauderdale, Lowndes, Montgomery, Noxubee, Pike, Quitman,\nl\nRankin, Walthall, Wayne, and Wilkinson Counties each have public defenders who are\nI\nemployed on a part-time or contractual basis or have systems where private attorneys are\nappointed on a case-by-case basis. Hinds County formerly had a system of case-by-case\nI\nappointments of counsel for indigent defendants and since 1991 has had a full-time\nI\npublic defender office. Forrest County recently hired a full time public defender,\nalthough other employees in the office are part-time. The public defender system in each\nI\nof the counties is operated on a county level.\nI\nArl_ument\nI. A FULL-TIME PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICE IS AN INTEGRAL PART\nI\nOF THE FAIR, EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OF\nJUSTICE AND EASES THE BURDEN ON LAW ENFORCEMENT\nOFFICIALS\nI\nA full-time public defender office is an integral part of the system of justice. If\nI\nthe indigent defense function is inadequate, every other component of the system must\nfind a way to compensate for such inadequacies. Law enforcement is adversely affected\nI\nbecause, among other reasons, indigent defendants who are unable to make bail or who\nI i\ndo not receive a speedy trial languish in often overcrowded co'unty jails wa!ting for the\ni'\nl:\nI resolution of their cases. The failure of the indigent defense system can create a situation\n,I\n: i\nin which counsel is not appointed until late in the proces_s, cau'lsing delay and potentially\nI\n! • I\nhindering chances of obtaining a conviction. Moreover, delay,, me,ans a waste of\nI 1\nI resources. Sheriffs are forced to use valuable resources supposedly earmarked for\nenforcement activities to ensure that these additional indigent defendants are kept in the\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\ncounty system, even when such defendants belong in the state penitentiary, should have\nI\nbeen released, or end up serving more time waiting for the disposition of their case than\nI\nthey receive in sentencing.\nA clear division of duties anaong law enforcement, prosecutors, and public\nI\ndefenders benefits the justice system as a whole. In contrast, the justice system\nI\ndeteriorates when any one component falls short. Implementing a public defender system\nI that meets constitutional standards will promote confidence and community cooperation\nin law enforcement eflbrts.\nI\nIh THE EXPERIENCE OF HINDS COUNTY SHOWS THAT A FULL-\nTIME PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICE FURTHERS THE FAIR,\nI EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE\nHinds County's experience shows that the availability and experience of the staff\nI\nof a full-time public defender office furthers the fair, efficient, and effective\nI administration of justice. The prosecutor's office and the public defender office\nrepresent, respectively, the interests of the state in securing a conviction and the interests\nI\nof indigent defendants in protecting their constitutional rights. When operating properly,\nI\nthey serve the interests of the citizens of Mississippi in a fair, efficient, and effective\nsystem of justice. The relationship created by an effective prosecutor and an effective\nI\npublic defender promotes the public interest and public .tOast in the justice system. This\nI\npermits the Sheriff of Hinds County to focus on law enforcement responsibi!ities without\n',!: _ 'r'\nalso having to handle the problems of indigent defendan_. Tl_b:full-time staffofthe\nI\n//\nHinds County public defender office are committed and e_perie, ncSed professionals who\nI .11 d: .\ndo not face the competing interests of private practices that part-time public defenders\nI\nI\n\nI\nhave. Full-time public defenders supported by investigators and other staff have the\nI\nresources necessary to handle their caseloads.\nI\nThe full-time public defender office in Hinds County helps ensure that counsel is\nappointed early and is present at the appropriate stages of the proceedings, that cases\nI\nlacking sufficient evidence are dismissed quickly instead of taking valuable time on the\nI\ndocket, that defendants are given appropriate bail options (thereby reducing the costs of\nI imprisoning more pre-trial detainees than necessary) and that cases continue to move\nthrough the system rather than remain on the docket indefinitely due to counsel who is\nI\nnot prepared to proceed.\nI The full-time public defender office also helps to promote judicial confidence in\nthe many complex and delicately balanced decisions that law enforcement agents make in\nI\nthe course of an investigation, arrest and disposition of a case. With full-time public\nI\ndefenders, the courts can have assurance about the quality of representation. The court is\nless likely to have to engage in second-guessing of law enforcement matters that require\nI\nthe effective advocacy of counsel, such as issues concerning the proper exclusion or\nI\nadmissibility of evidence, voluntariness of a confession, and knowledge and\nunderstanding of plea arrangements.\nI\nIII. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SHERIFFS OF COUNTIES IN WHICH\nINDIGENT DEFENDANTS ARE REPRESENTED BY[ PART-TIME\nI\nPUBLIC DEFENDERS DEMONSTRATES THE BURDEN IMPOSED ON\nSHERIFFS AND THE NEED FOR A FULL-TIME PUBLIC DEFENDER\nSYSTEM ., I\nI I\nIn contrast, tile burden imposed on the sheriffs of tl_e many other counties where\nt\nI\npublic defenders are employed on a part-time basis or attorneys are appointed on a case-\nby-case basis handicaps law enforcement officials. While there is a single office these\nI\nI\n\nI\nsheriffs can call when they need to speak with a prosecutor, there is no single.defender\nI\noffice to call when a problem arises that defense counsel can help to solve. The justice\nI\nsystems in these counties often move more slowly because there are no full-time public\ndefenders. Consequently, sheriffs house pretrial detainees longer than is necessary.\nI\nThese sheriffs expend too much time and effort resolving problems resulting from\nI\nindigent defendants lacking adequate representation. These problems include\nI unpredictable and unforeseeable costs and resources that must be devoted to the detention\nof indigent defendants, the obligation to keep cases moving through the judicial system\nI\nwithout counsel prepared and available, and the overall difficulty of obtaining\nI cooperation from unresponsive counsel lacking time and resources for the representation\nof such indigent defendants.\nI\nConclusion\nI For the reasons set forth herein, the Sheriffs submit that a statewide and state\nfunded full-time public defender system should be implemented to achieve a t'air,\nI\neffective, and efficient system of justice in Mississippi.\nI\nDated: July 7_, 2004\nI Respectfully submitted,\nI\nJOHN GRIFFIN JONES (MSB NO. 3217)\nJONES, FUNDERBURG & SESSUMS, PLLC\n• •-901 NORTH STATE STREET (39202)\nI\nPOST OFFICE BOX 13960\nJACKSON, MS 39201\n(601) 355-5200\nI\nCounsel for Amici Curiae\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI\nThis is to certify that I have caused to be served by on this\nI\n/'_'_ day of July, 2004 a true and correct copy of the foregoing Motion for Leave\nto File Brief of Amici Curiae Sheriffs of Quitman County, et al. in Support of Appellant\nI\nQuitman County and accompmlying Brief of Amici Curiae on the following:\nI\nHarold E.

These organizations believe that Mississippi's current public\ndefender system has a negative, disparate impact on the communities these two organizations serve.\nI\nThe NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (\"LDF\") is the nation's oldest civil\nI\nrights law firm, having been founded as an arm of the NAACP in 1939 by Charles Hamilton\nHouston and Thurgood Marshall. LDF was chartered by the Appellate Division of the Supreme\nI\n•Court of New York in 1940 as a non-profit legal aid society\"to render legal aid gratuitously to such\nI\nNegroes as may appear to be worthy thereof, who are suffering legal injustices by reason of race or\nI color and unable to employ and engage legal aid and assistance on account of poverty.\" Since 1957,\nLDF has operated independently from the NAACP. The United States Supreme Court has\nI\nrecognized that LDF \"has a corporate reputation for expertness in presenting and arguing the\nI difficult questions of law that frequently arise in civil rights litigation.\" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S.\n415,422 (1963). Throughout its history, LDF has been involved in such litigation throughout the\nI\ncountry, and has argued and won more cases before the United States Supreme Court than any other\n1 body of lawyers excluding the U.S. Department of Justice.\nSince its inception, LDF has litigated or provided technical assistance to parties and the court\nI\nin cases that expose racial bias in the criminal justice system.

Concentrated Poverty Among Black Mississippians Creates a Reliance Upon\nPublicly-Funded Counsel.\nI\nThe greatest share of the burden imposed by the absence of a properly funded indigent\nI\ndefense system in Mississippi is borne by African Americans and the black community. African\nAmericans are, on average, in greater need of indigent defense services because they are more likely\nI\nto live in poverty than members of any other racial group. An American Bar Association Report\nI\nrecommending full funding for the Criminal Justice Act' found that, as of 1991, blacks comprised\nI only 12% of the nation's population but comprised 30% of the families living below the poverty\nline/ In 2002, the United States Census Bureau found that 23.9°/'0 of Americans who identified\nI\nthemselves as black lived in poverty, compared to 12.1% for all races, and 10.3% for those who\nI identified themselves as white. 3\nThe State of Mississippi includes a much higher percentage of African Americans than the\nI\nrest of the United States. The Census Bureau found that 36.3% of Mississippi residents identified\nI themselves as black or Afi'ican-American in the 2000 Census/ The percentage of Aft'lean\nAmericans in Quitman County was even greater: 68.6% of the county's residents identified\nI\n_Criminal Justice Act of 1964, Pub.

''_2\nI\nSurvey evidence suggests that the overwhelming majority of criminal cases brought in\nMississippi are against indigent defendants, In its year 2000 Report to the Mississippi Legislature,\nI\nthe Mississippi Public Defenders Task Force asked judges in Mississippi's twenty-two judicial\nI\ncircuits to estimate the number of indigent criminal defendants that came before them in felony\ncases. The fifteen courts that responded estimated that the number of indigent defendants appearing\nI\nbefore them in felony cases ranged between 50% and 95%. t3 The average of these responses was\nI\njust over 82%. In Quitman County, the court estimated that over 90% of all criminal defendants\nwho appeared before it in felony cases were indigent, t4 These results, combined with the high\nI\ndegree of poverty in Mississippi's black community, indicate that the State's failure to provide even\nI\nminimally sufficient funding for indigent defense has an inordinate impact on African Americans.\nI A recent U.S. Department of Justice survey compared rates of representation by public and\nprivate attorneys in the federal and state court systems.

In the State of Alabama- Mississippi's neighbor and a state with\nI\nsimilar demographics _6- a study found that over half of the defendants using the State's indigent\nI\ndefense system were black. 17 As observed in a report by the American Bar Association's Section\non Criminal Justice, \"one conclusion to be drawn from these harsh statistics is that people of color\nI\nrequire appointed lawyers disproportionately more often than white people.

(\"LDF\nStudy,\" see Appendix A) showed that poor defendants in Mississippi who are represented by court-\nI\nappointed counsel (working only part-time representing indigent defendants) tend to spend more\nI\ntime in jail waiting for their cases to be resolved than defendants who are represented by full-time\npublic defenders. 2t Specifically, the LDF Study found that individuals represented by part-time\nI\nassigned counsel were 40% less likely to get out of jail before trial and spent an average of 96 more\nI\ndays in jail than those represented by full-time counsel. Individuals represented by part-time\nI contract counsel were 28% less likely to get out of jail than those defendants represented by full-\ntime counsel and spent an average of 81 more days in jail prior to release.\nI\nOverall, the LDF Study found that minorities were 19% less likely to get out ofjail and spent\nI an average of 52 more days injail than non-minorities. 22Research from individual counties showed\nan inversely proportional relationship between a county's minority population and a defendant's\nI\nchances of being released from jail prior to trial: the greater the concentration of minorities in a\nI particular county, the less likely it was that an accused person would be released prior to trial. 23\nFurthermore, the LDF Study revealed that the disabling effects of representation by part-time\nI\nI\n2°1d.The study found that only 37% of state inmates and 54% of federal inmates represented by\nappointed counsel met their attorneys within a week of arrest; in contrast, 60% of state inmates and 75%\nof federal inmates represented by private counsel spoke with their attorneys within a week of arrest.\nI\n2_Brooking and Fox, supra note 15.\nI \"-\"'Id. at 22.\n231d.

Prolonged Incarceration Has a Disproportionate and Debilitating Impact on\nAfrican-American Families and Communities.\nI\nExcessive periods of incarceration caused by an inadequate defense subject entire families\nI\nto severe consequences and deprive minority communities of both the financial and human capital\nnecessary to sustain themselves.\nI\nNational figures show that the black community is disproportionately burdened by the\nI\nremoval of parents fi'om their children due to incarceration. The Bureau of Justice Statistics found\nI that in 1999, of the 1,498,800 children with a parent in prison nationwide, 51.2% (767,200) of those\nchildren were black. 3° In all, a full 7% of all black children had a parent in prison, and black\nI\nchildren were nine times more likely to have a parent in prison than white children. 3j Although\nI comparable statistics are not available for Mississippi, the State's large African-American\npopulation and the high degree of poverty within it, combined with the documented failure of the\nI\nState's indigent defense system, make it all but certain that Mississippi's black children are similarly\naffected. 32\nI\nThe lack of a full-time public defender system has also taken its toll on the fiscal resources\nI\nof poor African-American families and communities in Mississippi.

While sitting in jail for needlessly protracted periods awaiting trial, many\nI\npoor defendants lost their jobs, homes, cars, and other sources of income and wealth. 33 Economic\nresources were expended when children were displaced and valuable tax revenue was lost to the\nI\ntowns and counties affected. Moreover, these communities wasted funds that could have been spent\nI\non much-needed social services instead of paying for pre-trial jail time. 34 Inasmuch as African\nAmericans are disproportionately among the State's poor, they bear the brunt of this drain of\nI\nresources.\ni\nD. Repeated Injustices and Inequities Lead African-American Defendants and\nCrime Victims to Lose Faith in the Criminal Justice System.\nI\nThere is a sense in Mississippi among many poor people and African Americans that the\ncriminal justice system is stacked against them, not only as criminal defendants but also as crime\ni\nvictims. 35Mississippi residents repeatedly bear witness to the fact that those who cannot afford to\nI\npay lawyers spend months - and sometimes years - languishing in jail waiting for their cases to be\nI resolved. While these poverty-stricken defendants wait in pre-trial incarceration limbo, they rarely\nhear fi'om the lawyers the court appoints to represent them. Indigent defendants often meet their\ni\ncourt-appointed counsel for the first time on the date of critical hearings. Subsequently, some\nI defendants plead guilty to serious charges without the benefit of investigation or even an explanation\nof the consequences of the plea agreements. In other instances, over-worked, under-paid, or\nI\n33Brooking and Fox, supra note 15, at 23. Among those indigent defendants surveyed for the\ni\nLDF Study, 73% who were working lost their jobs, 24% lost their homes, 22% lost their cars, 16% lost\nutilities, and 14% lost their phones. The resulting financial impact was felt by many of their families.\nSee also Barker, 407 U.S. at 532 (\"The time spent injail awaiting trial.., often means loss of ajob; it\nI\ndisrupts family life; and itenforces idleness. Most jails offer little or no recreational or rehabilitative\nprograms.

When inadequate indigent defense services lead to wrongful convictions,\nI\nunreasonable pre-trial incarceration, and excessive and inappropriate sentences, collective faith in\nthe system suffers. There is a ripple effect in the black community for each individual defendant\ni\n•whose liberty interests are trampled upon. Families, friends, neighbors and co-workers all lose trust\nI\nin the effectiveness and fairness of the criminal justice system when an individual is mistreated or\nI ignored by his or her counsel. Meanwhile, victims of crime in poor communities served by\ninadequate indigent defense systems also wait longer for resolution of cases and at times question\nI\nwhether the actual perpetrators were apprehended, tried, and convicted. This loss of public\nI confidence undermines the validity and finality of the results. 39\nI 36See,e.g., Burdine v.

Some see a moral justification for\nthis practice that lends legitimacy to an otherwise unjust criminal justice system.

The Collateral Consequences of Criminal Convictions in Mississippi are\nDisproportionately Borne by the African-American Community.\nI\nThe convictions and sentences meted out by the court and the economic losses caused by\nI\nthese detentions are not the only consequences of Mississippi's broken indigent defense system.\nSevere and continuing collateral consequences are attached to criminal convictions in Mississippi.\nI\nFor example, the State's professional and occupational licensing statutes restrict participation in a\nI\nvariety of professions by those convicted of crimes. 4° Moreover, Mississippi \"[e]mployers can ask\nabout arrests that never led to conviction and refuse to hire anyone with a criminal record no matter\nI\ntheir qualifications. ''4_ The State provides no mechanism for people with criminal records to obtain\nI\n\"certificates of rehabilitation\" that would signal to the community that a former offender is ready\nto become a productive and contributing member of society. In addition, people convicted of drug\nI\ncrimes face a lifetime ban on public assistance and food stamps in Mississippi, denying them and\nI\ntheir families a crucial means of support at a time when they are trying to get back on their feet. +_\nPerhaps the most damaging collateral consequence of felony convictions is the denial of the\nI\nfight to vote, known as felon disfranchisement. In Mississippi, disfranchisement is generally a\nI\nlifetime sanction. 43 Statistics current through the end of the year 2000 show that approximately 119,\nI\n(1995); David N. Dorfman & Chris K.

''48 A\nstatewide public defense system in Mississippi featuring full-time public defenders would enhance\nI\nthe quality of representation afforded to indigent African-American defendants and lead to greater\nI\nconfidence in the black community about the State's administration of criminal justice.\nI A. A Full-time and Properly Funded Public Defender System Would Help Raise\nthe Quality of Representation of Poor Blacks up to Constitutional Standards.\nI While not a panacea for all of the problems that exist in the criminal justice system, a full-\ntime and properly funded indigent defense system would yield many positive results. People served\nI\nby full-time public defenders tend to receive more meaningful advocacy than those who are\nI represented by part-time, under-funded appointed counsel. 49 For example, the LDF Study indicates\nthat in the Mississippi counties with full-time public defenders, defense attorneys visited their clients\nI\ninjail more frequently, spent more time with them, accepted and returned their clients' phone calls,\nI investigated cases more diligently, interviewed witnesses, and attempted to reduce bond more\nfrequently. 5° Full-time defenders also file more motions on behalf of their clients and investigate\nI\nI\n47Fabelo, supra note 35, at 136.\n48/d\"\nI\n49Brooking and Fox, supra note 15, at 5.\n5°1d.at 23-26.\nI\n12\nI\n\nI\nI\ncases more frequently and thoroughly than part-time defenders. 5_ In addition, full-time defenders\nI\ntend to remain engaged in cases, reducing the rate of turnover in counsel, which provides greater\ncontinuity and a better quality of defense. 52 The consistent advocacy provided by full-time public\nI\ndefenders in a properly funded system would provide more in-depth investigation and meaningful\nI\nadvocacy at plea hearings, trials and sentencing hearings. 53This would almost certainly lead to less\npre-trial jail time and a reduction in the number of undeserving felony convictions. Those\nI\nrepresented by publicly-funded counsel would be more likely to be acquitted, or when convicted\nI\nthey would receive prison sentences more proportionate to their crimes. Adequately funded\nrepresentation would spare countless African-American individuals and families the undue burdens\nI\n•of needless incarceration and the collateral consequences of criminal convictions.\nI\nB. A Full-Time and Properly Funded Public Defender System Would Enhance the\nLegitimacy and Effectiveness of the Criminal Justice System.\nI\nBeyond a defendant's individual liberty interests, full-time public defender systems also\nI provide benefits to the entire community and the criminal justice system itself. While seemingly\ncounter-intuitive, serving the individual defendant's interests actually coincides with improving the\nI\nsystem as a whole, since \"the true adversarial system of American jurisprudence will gain legitimacy\nI in the eyes of the entire population,\" including families and, indirectly, among crime victims through\nincreased faith in the accuracy of criminal verdicts. 54 \"A strong indigent defense system allows\nI\nthose most alienated from our institutional mainstream to feel that the system isnot 'stacked' against\nI\n5_Id.at 11, 14, 19.\nI\n521d.at 11, 19. The authors found that 40% of the Mississippi defendants represented by contract\ncounsel experienced a change in their attorney, while only 15% of those represented by full-time public\ndefenders saw such a change.

''55 In the long term, this\nI\nincreased confidence will lead to fewer \"grievances 'against the system' among alienated\np0pulations. ''56\nI\nThis enhanced legitimacy would also benefit crime victims in the black community.\nI\nStatistics show that African Americans are more likely to be victims of crime than members of other\nracial groups: 7 Properly funded, full-time public defender offices force prosecutors to use their own\nI\nresources efficiently and to work diligently to avoid fingering the wrong perpetrator or wasting time\nI\nand money prosecuting innocent parties. In addition, through their zealous advocacy, full-time\npublic defenders help ensure that police officers and prosecutors apprehend and appropriately charge\nI\nthe correct offenders, bringing closure for African-American crime victims and their families.\nI\nMoreover, effective indigent defense systems aid in the expeditious dispensation of justice\nI by allowing cases to move quickly through the system and creating opportunities for implementation\nof innovative programs - effects which increase the system's capacity to respond to growing\nI\ndemands: 8 Cases are resolved more reliably and yet more efficiently than when the community is\nI forced to rely on inadequately staffed and poorly funded indigent defense services.

L. Rev. 1255, 1255 (1994) (\"Like many social\nI\nills, crime afflicts African-Americans with a special vengeance. African-Americans are considerably\nmore likely than whites to be raped, robbed, assaulted, and murdered.\"); id. at 1278 n.2 (citing Ted Gest\net al., Violence it, America: The Victims' Profiles, U.S. News & World Rep., Jan. 17, 1994, at 22, 30)\nI\n(noting that black male youth ages 14-17, with a victimization rate of 65.9 per 100,000 in the population,\nare more likely to be victims of crime than white youth in the same age group, who have a victimization\nrate of only 8.5 per 100,000); See also Hanna Rosin, Action Jackson: Jesse's Volte-face on Crime, New\nI Republic, Mar. 24, 1994, at 17 (reporting that blacks are four times as likely than whites to be raped, three\ntimes as likely to be robbed, twice as likely to be assaulted, and seven times more likely to be murdered).\nI 5SFabelo, supra note 35, at 137.\n14\nI\n\nI\nI\nAmerican defendants, crime victims, and victims' families spend far less time waiting for justice.\nI CONCLUSION\nImproving indigent defense is a civil rights issue which touches on numerous concerns that\nI\nare critical to African Americans in Mississippi - both the accused and law-abiding families and\nI\ncommunity members. Since African Americans rely upon publicly-funded defense counsel more\noften than other citizens when accused of criminal acts and are disproportionately harmed by its\nI\nfailures, it follows that the black community stands to benefit directly fi'om a full-time and properly\nI\nfunded public defender system.\nGiven the racially disproportionate impact of the State's indigent defense failure at every\nI\n.level, it is clear that Mississippi can do better. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund\nI\nand 100 Black Men of Jackson urge this Court to interpret the State's constitution in a way that\nI requires Mississippi to do justice by mandating adequate state funding for public defenders.\np,d\nDATEJDul:y_,_004\nI\nRespectfully S_\nI\nI\nDamon T.

First, the data\nI\ncollection eflbrt from public records was obviously dependent upon the quality of the records in\neach county, and this quality varied vastly l¥om county to county. As a result, many of the\nI\nvariables we originally hoped to collect were largely unavailable. For example, the data\nI collection form in Appendix D calls for the date an individual is declared indigent.\nUnfortunately, this inlbnnation _as missing two-thirds of the til'n¢. Another example lies inthe\nI\ninibrmation regarding bail. The date bail was set was not recorded in the court files in nearly 80\npercent of the cases. Although this information would have provided additional insight, the\nI\nmissing informatiol] was not essential to this study.\nI\nVital to this study is infommtion on the length of dine individuals \",','erehoused in county\njails. Because the court flies did not contain complete inlbrmation on this variable, the county\nI\njail logbooks were relied heavily upon to retrieve these dates. Even so, this important variable is\nI not available in 89 cases.\nThe second major roadblock encountered during the data collection effort was during the\nI\npersonal interview stage. Of the 100 individuals selected for personal interview, only 54 were\nI u[ti.mately intervicv,'ed. Most individuals from this population who are currently housed in\nMississippi correctional Pacilities were interviewed. Individuals housed in correctional\nI\ninstitutions outside the state were not interviewed. Private investigators were used to locate and\ninterview the remaining non-institutionalized population. These individuals are not an easy\nI\ngroup to locate, and they are highly suspicious of anyone wanting to discuss their criminal\nI\nbackgrounds.\nI\nI\n43\nI\n\n..... ......... : . .,\nI\nI\nI\nAlthough only 54 of'the personal interviews were completed, this _nformation is\nI\nsufficient for the purposes for which it is intended. The fifty percent response rate is actually\nquite good and the absolute size of the data set allows us to draw conclusions concerning the\nI\neconomic impact of the public defender system in Mississippi.\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n44\nI\n\n•._ .... •...\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nAPPENDIXG\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n45\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nSumma_' Statisl[_- Public RecordsDalaba_\nNumber of\nMean Std.

The attached  brief would be filed \nou  behalf of the Quitman  County  Chamber of Commerce,  which holds the  view  that state \nfunding of an indigent  defense  system  is  essential  for  a number of reasons:  It  would \nprovide  a more  secure economic  future  for  Quitman  County by lessening  the \noverwhelming costs  of the  criminal justice  system  and reducing the governmental  waste \nof scarce  taxpayer funds by  increasing  efficiency,  and  it  would  promote  public  confidence \n-  Gn  the  administration  of justice.  As  indicated by  the  attached brief,  the  Quitman  Chamber \nof Commerce  has  interests  that will  likely be affected by  the outcome  of the  case,  and  its \ninterests  are neither  adequately represented nor  protected by  those  already parties  to the \ncase.\n  \nINTRODUCTI  Cy \nAmicus  curiae  Quitman County Chamber of Commerce,  because of its role \nas  a voice  for the  Quitman  County business  and professional communities  and its \ndedication to  enhancing the business climate  and  quality  of life  in  Quitman  County,  is \nuniquely positioned  to  comment  on  fiscal responsibility  and community  development \nissues  associated  with the debate over whether  the  State  should  fund  indigent  defense  in \nMississippi  and  in  Quitman  County.  We believe  that the  creation  of a  statewide  indigent \ndefense  system  funded  by  the  State  rather  than the counties would  lead to  a more  secure \neconomic  future  for  Quitman County by  lessening  the  overwhelming costs  of the criminal \njustice  system  and reducing  further  governmental  waste  of taxpayer  funds  and  would \npromote  public  confidence  in  the  administration  of justice.  Considerations  such  as  these \nin  which  the  community  at large  is  affected  should not be overlooked in  this  debate. \nBACKGROUND \nQuitman County has public  defenders  who  are  employed on  a part-time, \ncontractual basis.  This public  defender system  is  operated  on  a county  level,  and  is \nfunded  exclusively by  county  taxpayers.  Amicus  curiae  Quitman County  Chamber of \nCommerce  is  a private  organization that  serves  as  a voice  for the  business  and \nprofessional  communities  and  advocates  on  behalf of economic  and community \ndevelopment,  fiscal  responsibility,  and better quality  of life in the  community.\n  \nWould  Lead to  a More  Secur e Ec onomi ic  Future  for  Quitm:  an  Cc  ounty \nBy Lessening  the  Overwhelming  Costs  of the  Criminal  Justice  System \n2  i  €0  unds, \nA.  The  Costs  of the  Criminal Justice  System  Under the  Current \nPublic  Defender  System  Have  Been  Enormous  and Led to \nSevere Economic Dysfunction  in  Quitman  County. \nState  funding  of a  statewide  indigent  defense  system  would  provide  a more \nstable  economic  foundation  for  the  county  than the  current part-time/contractual,  county- \nfunded public  defender system.  The  current  system  has  lec the  county  into  financial \ndisarray,  and continuation  of it will  only result in  further peril  to  the  county’s  already lean \ncoffers.  The  State  has  imposed enormous  and unpredictable  indigent  defense  costs  on \nQuitman  County  and  its  taxpayers  by  forcing  them  to  incur overwhelming  expenses  for \nthe defense  of indigent  defendants,  some  of whom are  not  even residents  of Quitman \nCounty.  Just  one example is  the  $250,000 over the  course  of a decade  in  expenses  for the \ndefense of two  non-Quitman  County  residents,  Robert  Simon,  Jr.,  and  Anthony  Carr,  for \ntheir trial  and  subsequent  appeals  on  several  charges  of murder,  which they  committed  in \nthe  county  in  1991.  See Reed Branson,  2  Counties  Sue Miss,  for  Public  Defender \nMoney,  The  Commercial Appeal, December  17,  1999,  at  B1.  These  cases  are  still \nongoing,  and  it  is  estimated that  $30,000  a  year  is  being spent currently  for their  appeals. \nPursuant  to  these  costs, the  county had to raise property taxes  three  years  in a row,  and \nsecure  a  loan  used to  cover  expenses,  which  ultimately  took five  years to  pay off.  See id. \nAs  aresult,  financial resources  available  to  fund schools,  hospitals,  local  law \nenforcement,  and  the  offices of the county  government relating  to  traditional  health, \nsafety,  and welfare obligations  to  its  citizenry have  been  dangerously  reduced. \nThe  defendants’  imposition of indigent defense  costs  on  Quitman  County \n  \nhas  disproportionately  increased  its  tax burden.  Counties  with small populations but \n   \naa \nsignificant  crime  problems ~ often  from non-residents  — such as  Quitman  County  are  left \nwith the  difficult dilemma of either raising  taxes  on its  already  burdened tax  base  or \ncutting  important  services,  such  as  education  or health  care.  This  arrangement hurts  those \ncounties that  are  already  the  most  financially  strapped.  The  best  solution to  the  current \nsituation  is  for the  State of Mississippi  to  fund  a  full-time public  defender  system  in \nQuitman County,  as  well  as  other  counties  in  similar  situations.  This  solution would \nrelieve  some  of the pressure  on  the  scarce  financial resources  of Quitman  County  and \nallow  it to  use  its  tax  dollars  on  much-needed  endeavors  like  health care,  education,  and \ncommunity  development. \nB.  A State-Funded  Public Defender System  Would  Reduce \nFurther  Governmental Waste  of Scarce  Taxpayer Funds  By \nBoosting the  Efficiency of the Criminal Justice  System, \nThereby Increasing  Funds  for  Other  Endeavors \nImplementation of a state-funded  public  defender  system in  Quitman \nCounty would reduce the waste of taxpayer funds  and inefficiency  that  currently  runs \nrampant in  the  criminal justice  system  in the  county.  This  would  allow the use of more \nfunds for  essential county  services. \nThe  criminal justice  system in  Quitman County is made  up of distinct \ncomponents which must  operate  in harmony  to  produce the  optimal result --  conviction \nand imprisonment  of those guilty of crimes.  At the  core  of this  system  is reliance on  the \nadversarial process.  There is  an expectation  that  an  effective,  diligent  counsel will \npresent to  the courts  the most impressive  statement  of facts,  testimony  of witnesses,  and \nanalysis of precedent  in  support of the  client’s position.  In  order  for the  confrontation \nbetween  adversaries to  lead  to  a reliable  determination by  the  factfinder,  each  side  must \n  \n \n   \nbe relatively balanced.  If either  side is  disadvantaged,  underfunded,  or overburdened,  the \n ’\n . criminal justice  system,  fails.  See Caraway v.  Beto,  421  F.2d  636,  637-38  (5°  Cir.  1970) \n(our  adversary  system cannot  serve  its  function  unless  the  accused’s  counsel  conducts the \nrequired  investigation  and presents  an  intelligent  and knowledgeable  defense).  It makes \nno  sense to  skimp  on  one component  while fully  funding  another  component  since  they \nmust both be  operative at more  or  less  the same  level  for  the  entire  system to  work \nproperly.  In the  present criminal justice system,  the  state  funds  most of the  prosecutorial \nfunction  and provides  it with  all  the resources  it needs,  while providing  little  or no \nfunding  for the defense  function.  Counties  must  scrape  together what they  can  to  fund \nthe defense  function.  The  only  logical  course  of action  is  to  attempt  to  get the  maximum \nvalue out  of the  funds  that  are put into  the  criminal justice  system  by  ensuring that  each \ncomponent,  including  the  indigent  defense  system, works properly. \nThe  current part-time/contractual,  county-funded  public  defender  system in \nQuitman County  does not work properly.  The  criminal justice  system  moves  no  faster \nthan the slowest-moving party.  Counties pay  much  of the  cost  associated with \nincarcerating  defendants prior to  trial and/or  conviction.  Accordingly,  excessive pretrial \ndelays cause  counties  to  spend  their own  funds  to hold  defendants  in  county custody, \neven  though these costs  properly  should be  bome by the State. \nAiso, the current public  defender  system  leads  to costly  appeals,  retrials,  and \npost-conviction proceedings,  some based  on the  inadequacy of defense  counsel.  Properly \nfunded public  defenders would  reduce the number of errors  and  make the  system more \ncost  effective in the  long  run.  For  example,  there  have been  numerous  post-conviction \nchallenges  to  the adequacy  of counsel provided  to  indigent  defendants tried  for  felonies  in \nQuitman  County in the past.  These  challenges —particularly  the  Simon-Carr proceedings- \n-  are  expensive for Quitman  County  and its  taxpayers. \n  \n \nEnsuring  the  financial health  of Quitman  County  for  the  future  is  an \nimportant  goal  of the  Quitman  County  Chamber  of Commerce,  and  implementing  a  state- \nfunded public  defender  system  would go  a  long  way  in  helping  to  reach  that  goal. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing reasons, the decision below  should be  affirmed. \nDated:  April  (7,  2001 \nRespectfully  submitted, \nQUITMAN  COUNTY  CHAMBER  OF  Cc  ERCE \nby  W/  ha Af|   \nA \nRobert  G.

Defense  counsel  must \nbe  able  to  investigate  the  charges  against  their  clients,  secure  necessary experts, \nmeaningfully  consult  with  their clients,  and diligently prepare  for  trial.  Inadequate \nresources  and  extreme  caseloads  of more  than  six  hundred  (600)  felony  cases  per  year, \nhowever,  are  preventing  the part-time  Forrest  County  public  defender  from  being  able  to \nprovide  this  effective  assistance  of counsel.  Because  of these  systemic  defects,  the  part- \ntime Forrest  County public  defender  is  unable  to  meaningfully  confer with  his  clients, \nconduct  pre-trial  investigations,  secure  the  presence  of witnesses,  present  and  pursue \nmotions,  evaluate  sentencing  options,  and  prepare  for trial.  As  a result,  indigent \ndefendants  in  Forrest  County  are  receiving  the  assistance  of counsel  that  is  grossly \ndeficient  and  of the type  that  seriously jeopardizes  the  adversarial  nature  of their  legal \nproceedings. \nA plaintiff may prospectively raise  a  claim  of ineffective  assistance  wherever  the \nright  to  counsel  has  been deprived  through  systemic  error  rather than  the  performance  of \nindividual  counsel.  Courts  throughout  the  country have held  that  a plaintiff may bring \nsuch  a claim  when a state  fails  to  provide  adequate  indigent  defense  resources.  A \ncontrary conclusion  would  be  illogical.  If the  State  were  to  provide  only  one  lawyer  to \nrepresent  thousands  of indigent  defendants,  this  Court  clearly would  not  require  each \nindigent  defendant  to  seek  relief separately  through  an  appeal  or  a post-conviction \npetition  for  writ  of habeas  corpus. \n  \n \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE  SYSTEM  OF  INDIGENT  DEFENSE  DESIGNED  BY  THE \nSTATE  AND  IMPLEMENTED  BY  FORREST  COUNTY \nSYSTEMICALLY  FAILS  TO  PROVIDE  THE  EFFECTIVE \nASSISTANCE  OF  COUNSEL \nIn  non-capital  cases,  the  State  of Mississippi  provides  no  funds  for,  and  is \notherwise  involved  with,  the  system  of indigent  defense.  Instead,  each  county  is \nresponsible  for  establishing  a  system  of indigent  defense  within  its  borders,  and  the  State \nrelies  on  the  counties  to provide  indigent  defendants  with  adequate  representation.  See \nMiss.  Code  Ann.  §  25-32-1,  et seq. \nFor  its  system  of indigent  defense,  the  Forrest  County  Board  of Supervisors \nretained  Mr.  J.  B.  Van  Slyke to  serve part-time  as  the  Forrest  County public  defender. \nEach  year,  hundreds  of indigent persons  rely on  Mr.  Van  Slyke  to  represent  them  in \nfelony  criminal proceedings.  Despite  the  important  consequences  of such proceedings, \nMr.  Van  Slyke  has  an  extreme  caseload  and  inadequate  resources  and  is  ill-equipped  to \ndeliver  the  legal  representation  to  which his  clients  are  constitutionally  entitled.  Even  the \nmost  diligent  and  knowledgeable  public  defender —  one  with  an  “S”  painted  on his  chest  — \ncould  not  surmount  these  systemic  deficiencies. \nA.  Mr.  Van  Slyke  Lacks  Indigent Defense  Resources \nTo  complete  the  tasks  necessary to  provide  indigent  defendants  with \nconstitutionally  adequate  representation,  a public  defender  requires  adequate  office  space, \nfurniture,  equipment,  supplies  and  resources,  including  clerical  support  staff,  and  funding \nfor  experts  and  investigators.  Mr.  Van  Slyke,  however,  does  not  have  available  such \nresources. \n   \nMr.  Van  Slyke  has  limited  equipment  and  does  not  have  enough  clerical  personnel \nto  timely prepare  motions  and  other  documents.  Instead,  Mr.  Van  Slyke has  only  a \nminimal  expense  allowance  that 1s  insufficient  to  support  a  full-time  secretary. \nMr.  Van  Slyke  does  not  have  the  resources  to  hire  paralegals  to  assist  with \nconducting  legal  research,  marshaling  facts,  drafting  pleadings,  preparing  for  trial,  or \nother  essential  functions.  As a  result,  Mr.  Van  Slyke  performed  these  tasks  without  the \nassistance  of a  paralegal. \nMr.  Van  Slyke  does  not  have  the  resources  necessary to  utilize  expert  witnesses  or \nhire investigators.  As  a  result,  Mr.  Van  Slyke  does  not  have  the  assistance  necessary to \ninvestigate  charges  and  obtain  witness  statements.  In  addition,  Mr.  Van  Slyke  frequently \nis  unable  to  engage  expert  witnesses  or  to  procure  necessary psychiatric  evaluations  and \nscientific tests. \nB.  Mr.  Van  Slyke  Has  an  Excessive  Caseload \nA  public  defender cannot  provide  indigent  defendants  the  effective  assistance  of \ncounsel  if burdened  by an excessive  caseload.  In Forrest  County,  however,  there  are  an \ninsufficient  number  of attorneys  to  meet  the  constitutional  mandate. \nFor  several  years,  national  legal  organizations  have  adopted  national  standards \nrecommending that  full-time  public  defenders  not  be  assigned more  than  150  felonies  per \nyear,  or 400  misdemeanors  per  year,  or 200 juvenile  cases  per year,  or  25  appeals  per \nyear.  See  American  Bar  Association,  Criminal  Justice  in  Crisis  at  43  (Nov.  1988); \nNational  Legal  Aid  and  Defender  Association  Guidelines  for  Negotiating  and  Awarding \nGovernmental  Contracts  for  Criminal  Defense  Services,  Guideline  I1]-6  (comment) \n(1984);  National  Advisory  Commission  on  Criminal  Justice  Standards  and  Goals:  Courts, \n   \nStandard  13/12,  \"Workload  of Public  Defenders\"  at  276  (1973).  Overburdened  public \ndefenders  are  advised to  refuse  cases  or take  steps  to  reduce  excessive  caseloads. \nIn  contravention  of these  national  standards,  in  Forrest  County only  one  part-time \npublic  defender ~ Mr.  Van  Slyke — represents  all  indigent  felony  defendants. \nConsequently,  during  calendar year  2000,  Mr.  Van  Slyke  handled  more  than  six  hundred \n(600)  felony dispositions.  Mr.  Van  Slyke’s  part-time  public  defender  caseload  was  more \nthan  four times  greater  than  the  recommended  maximum  level  for  a  full-time  public \ndefender.  This  caseload  so  overwhelmed  Mr.  Van  Slyke  that  he  did  not  have  the  time  to \npractice  law  in  a  manner  consistent  with  constitutional  mandates. \nCc,  The  Forrest  County  System  of Inadequate  Resources  and  Extreme \nCaseloads  Undermines  the  Adequacy  of the  Adversarial  Process  and \nResults  in  the  Systemic  Denial  of the  Effective  Assistance  of Counsel \nAn  overwhelming  caseload,  a  lack  of resources,  and  an  inability to  refuse  to \naccept  new  clients  under Mississippi  law  prevents  Mr.  Van  Slyke  from  meaningfully and \nadequately undertaking  the  tasks  necessary to  provide  the  effective  assistance  of counsel. \nMr.  Van  Slyke  lacks  the  time  and  resources  necessary to  meaningfully confer with  his \nclients,  conduct  pretrial  investigations,  secure  the  presence  of witnesses,  present  and \npursue  motions,  evaluate  sentencing  options,  and  prepare  for  trial.  Mr.  Van  Slyke \nultimately  is  required  to  sacrifice  the  demands  of one  client  for  another,  so  that  Mr.  Van \nSlyke  often  is  constructively  absent  from  representation. \nBecause  of systemic  defects,  Mr.  Van  Slyke  does  not  meet  and  confer with  his \nclients  in  a meaningful  manner prior  to,  and  in between,  each  critical  stage  of their \ncriminal  proceedings.  He  typically meets  his  clients  for  a  few  minutes  on  the  day  of the \npreliminary  hearing,  and  often does  not  talk  to  them  again  until  the  next  court  hearing. \n  \n \nMr.  Van  Slyke  lacks  investigators  and  frequently is  unable  to  conduct  pre-trial \ninvestigations.  Because  of his  excessive  caseload,  Mr.  Van  Slyke  rarely  initiates  an \ninvestigation  until  the  eve  of trial,  and  he  frequently  lacks  the  time  to  meet  with  or \nsubpoena witnesses,  visit  the  scene  of the  crime,  or  examine  evidence.  In  addition,  Mr. \nVan  Slyke  lacks  the  funds  to  employ necessary  and  appropriate  expert  witnesses. \nMr.  Van  Slyke  also  frequently lacks  the  time  and  resources  to  research  relevant \nlegal  issues,  present  pre-trial  motions,  or conduct  appropriate  discovery.  An  excessive \ncaseload  forces  Mr.  Van  Slyke  to  ration his  time,  which  inevitably  compromises  his \nability to  prepare  thoroughly  for  each case.  Overwhelmed by  an  excessive  caseload  and  a \nlack  of support,  Mr.  Van  Slyke  often  is  unable  to  seek  bond  reductions,  explore  pre-trial \nalternatives  to  incarceration,  prepare  for trial,  and  prosecute  appeals  and  motions  for  post- \nconviction  relief.  Some  clients  remain  incarcerated  for protracted  periods  prior to  the \ndisposition  of their  cases;  others  waived  their right  to  a  speedy trial. \nMr.  Van  Slyke’s  inability to  meaningfully confer with  his  clients,  conduct  pre-trial \ninvestigations,  utilize  expert  witnesses,  and  file  motions  has  far-reaching  consequences. \nMr.  Van  Slyke  does  not obtain  important information,  including  the  names  of valuable \nwitnesses,  possible  alibis,  defenses  or mitigating  circumstances,  and  the  availability  of \nrelevant  evidence.  Without  such  information,  he  cannot  advocate  effectively against \ndetention  or  the  imposition  of bail,  participate  effectively in  plea negotiations,  or prepare \nfor  trial.  In  addition,  he jeopardizes  his  clients’  ability to  make  informed  decisions, \nincluding  the  advisability of pleading  guilty or proceeding  to  trial. \nAs  a  result  of these  systemic  deficiencies,  a  significant  number  of indigent \ndefendants  are  likely to  be  receiving  assistance  of counsel  that  is  grossly  deficient  and  of \n   \nthe type  that  seriously jeopardizes  the  adversarial  nature  of their  legal  proceedings.  Some \nindigent  criminal  defendants  who  have meritorious  defenses  are  persuaded  to  plead  — \nguilty,  while  others  receive  harsher  sentences  than  the  facts  of their  case  may  warrant. \nThe  likelihood  that  any one  Forrest  County  indigent  defendant  will  be  deprived  of \nconstitutionally adequate  representation  is  real  and  immediate. \nD.  Mississippi’s  System  of Indigent  Defense  is  Constitutionally \nInadequate \nMississippi  public  defender  caseloads  are  unacceptably high,  and  the  amount  of \nmoney Mississippi  spends  per  case  on  public  defender  services  is  unacceptably  low. \nExperts  such  as Mr.  Robert  Spangenberg,  President  of The  Spangenberg  Group,  a \nnationally  recognized  private  firm  that  has  conducted  studies  of indigent  defense  systems \nin  several  states,  concluded  that even  the  most  well-intended  Mississippi  attorney  could \nnot provide  the  effective  assistance  of counsel  if burdened  by  such  an  excessive  caseload \nand  lack  of resources.  See  The  Spangenberg Group,  Indigent Defense in Mississippi, \nPrepared  for the  Mississippi  Bar  Association  Criminal  Justice  Task  Force  (January  1995) \n(updated  in  1997  and  1998).  Mr.  Spangenberg  determined  that  funding  for  indigent \ndefense  in  Mississippi  “‘is  totally  inadequate,”  that  Mississippi  is  one  of only  a  few  states \nthat  does  not provide  state  funds  for  indigent  defense,  and  that  Mississippi  had  one  of the \nlowest  rate  of expenditures  on  indigent  defense.  Jd.  at  51.  Moreover,  Mississippi  public \ndefenders  have  “unacceptable  caseload  levels.”  Jd.  at  59.  Mr.  Spangenberg  concluded \nthat  the  lack  of adequate resources  for  indigent  defense  services  in Mississippi  results  in \npoor  quality  services  and  representation.  Jd.  at  51. \n   \nIl.  INFRINGEMENTS  UPON  THE  RIGHT  TO  THE  EFFECTIVE \nASSISTANCE  OF  COUNSEL  MAY  BE  CHALLENGED \nPROSPECTIVELY \nThe  Attorney  General  argues  that  a  systemic  claim  for  ineffective  assistance \nsimply may not  be  raised  in  a  civil  proceeding,  by anyone.  See  AG  Brief at  33  (right  to \ncounsel  is  an  individual  right  that  must  be  “challenged  in proper  criminal  proceedings”  on \nappeal).  The  Supreme  Court  of Mississippi  never has  considered whether  systemic \nconditions  that  pervade  and  undermine  the  trial  process  can  deprive  indigent  defendants \nof their  right  to  counsel.’  The  Attorney  General  asks  this  Court  to  conclude,  however,  that \nif Mississippi  retained  only one  lawyer  to  represent  thousands  of indigent  defendants, \neach  indigent  defendant’s  sole  recourse  would be  through  a  direct  appeal  or  a post- \nconviction  petition  for writ  of habeas  corpus.  This position  is  illogical  and  refuted  by \nestablished  case  law. \nA.  Plaintiffs  May  Prospectively  Raise  Systemic  Sixth  Amendment  Claims \nThis  Court  has  ordered  prospective  relief to  ensure  that  the  State’s  system  of \nindigent  defense  does  not  deprive  indigent  defendants  the  effective  assistance  of counsel. \nSee  Jackson  v.  State,  732  So.  2d  187  (Miss.  1999)  (holding that  indigent  defendants  on \ndeath  row  are  “entitled  to  appointed  and  compensated  counsel”  in  state post-conviction \nproceedings).  In Jackson,  this  Court  concluded  that  the  indigent  defense  system  “‘is \n  \n'  The  Attorney General  throws this  Court a  red  herring when  he  suggests  that  this  issue \nwas  resolved  in  Wilson  v.  State,  574  So.2d  1338  (Miss.  1990).  See  AG  Brief at  34-35. \nThe  Court  in  Wilson  concluded that  it  could  appoint  attorneys  to  indigent  defense  cases  so \nlong as  the  Court  refunded  counsel  their  actual  expenses.  /d.  at  1341.  In  Wilson  the \nCourt  presumed that  such  an  attorney would  possess  the  necessary time  and  resources  to \ndevote  to  the  indigent  defendant’s  case.  Proceeding under this  presumption  about  the \nindigent  defense  system,  the  Court resolved  to  determine  the  attorney ineffective \nassistance  claim  on  a  case  by  case  basis.  The  Court  did  not  address  the  type  of claim \npresented  here:  a  system  ineffectiveness  claim raised  prospectively. \n  \n \nflawed,”  and  noted  that  it  could  “no  longer  sit  idly by”  while  the  State  refused  to  establish \na  system  that  provides  the  effective  assistance  of counsel.  /d.  at  188,  191.  The  Court \nestablished  a per  se  rule without  requiring  individual  defendants  to  demonstrate  prejudice. \nExcept  for  cases  involving  attorney  ineffectiveness,  every right to  counsel  case \ndecided  by the  United  States  Supreme  Court  since  Gideon  v.  Wainwright,  372  U.S,  335 \n(1963),  also  has  rejected  a  case-by-case  analysis  in favor  of a per  se  rule.  In these  cases, \nthe  Court  acknowledged  that  when  the  government is  responsible  for the  defect,  prejudice \nneed  not be  shown;  the  Court  analyzed  the  state’s  conduct  without  examining  the \nperformance  of individual  counsel.  According  to  the  Court,  where  the  quality  of the \naccused's  representation  is  compromised  by  incompetency,  bias,  or conflict  of interest,  he \nis  entitled  to  relief remedying  these  conditions. \nThe  Court  applied  a per  se rule  rather than  a case-by-case  analysis,  for  example,  in \nPowell  v.  Alabama,  287  U.S.  45  (1932)  and  Gideon,  where  the  defect  was  the  state’s \nactual  denial  of counsel.  In  United States  v.  Wade,  388  U.S.  218  (1967),  automatic \nreversal  was  appropriate because  the  state  denied  counsel  at a  critical  stage  of the \nproceedings.  In  Herring  v.  New  York,  422  U.S.  853  (1975)  and  Geders  v.  United States, \n425  U.S.  80  (1976),  the  Court  applied  a  prophylactic  rule  because  the  state’s  intrusion \ninto  the  attorney-client  relationship  impeded counsel’s  ability  to  subject  the  state’s  case  to \nadversarial  testing.  See Herring,  422  U.S.  at  858  (trial judge’s  refusal  to  hear  closing \narguments);  Geders,  425  U.S.  at  85  (trial Judge’s  refusal  to  allow  defense  counsel  to  meet \nwith  his  client  during  an  overnight  recess).  Similarly,  in Holloway  v.  Arkansas,  435  US. \n475,  484  (1978),  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  trial  court  abused  its  discretion  by \nfailing  to  investigate  defense  counsel's  pre-trial  claim  that  a  conflict  of interest prevented\nhim  from  providing  effective  assistance  of counsel.  In  each  case  the  condition  which \nundermined  the  adequacy  of the  process  operated  apart  from  the  performance  of \nindividual  counsel.  The  Court  emphasized  the  legitimacy  of the  trial process  and  viewed \nthe  reliability of the result  not  as  an  end  in  itself but  as  a  desirable  consequence  of \nvigorous  advocacy.  See,  e.g.,  Gideon,  372  U.S.  at  335;  Holloway,  435  US.  at  488. \nWhen the  right  to  counsel  has  been  deprived  through  systemic  error,  relief is \nprophylactic  in the  form  of  a per  se  rule  mandating the  removal  of the  condition \nthreatening  to  undermine  the  adequacy of the  adversarial  process.  Since  the  system  has \nbroken  down,  there  can be  no  presumption  of legitimacy  in  the  outcome  and  there  can be \nno  requirement  that  a defendant  demonstrate prejudice  in the  result.  See Perry  v.  Leek, \n488  U.S.  272,  280  (1989)  (system  cases  are  not  \"subject  to  the  kind  of prejudice  analysis \nthat  is  appropriate  in  determining whether the  quality of a  lawyer's  performance  itself has \nbeen  constitutionally  ineffective\");  Satterwhite  v.  Texas,  486  U.S.  249,  257  (1988) \n(automatic  reversal  is  appropriate  when  \"the  deprivation  of the  nght  to  counsel  affected- \nand  contaminated-the  entire  criminal  proceeding”). \nThis  rule  should  apply  to  cases  involving  the  state's  failure  to  provide  adequate \nindigent  defense  resources.  Such  failures  are  rooted  not  in the  lack  of diligence  or \ncompetence  of the  individual  attorney,  but  in  systemic  conditions  that  pervade  and \nundermine  the  trial  process.  Since ineffective  assistance  more  often  results  from  an \nattorney's  errors  of omission,  the record is  likely  to  conceal  the  information  defense \ncounsel  should have  discovered.  The  court  can  have  no  confidence  in  any  given  outcome, \nand post-conviction  review  does  not  guarantee  that  indigent  defendants  will  receive \nadequate  assistance. \n   \nB.  Courts  Around  the  Country  Have  Recognized  Prospective  Claims  of \nIneffective  Assistance  of Counsel \nCourts  around  the  country have  concluded  that  plaintiffs  may raise  prospective \n(pre-trial)  claims  of ineffective  assistance  attributable  to  systemic  resource  deprivation. \nThese  courts  permitted  plaintiffs  to  use  statistical  evidence  to  establish  that the  public \ndefenders’  ability to  provide  effective  assistance  has  been  severely jeopardized.  The \nplaintiffs  were  not  required  to  prove  the  likelihood  of harm  on  a  \"case  by case\"  basis. \nIn  Luckey  v.  Harris,  860  F.2d  1012  (1 1°  Cir.  1988),  for example,  the  Eleventh \nCircuit  found  that  a  class  of indigent  defendants  awaiting trial  stated  a  claim  by  alleging \nthat systemic  deficiencies  prevented  counsel  from  providing constitutionally  adequate \nrepresentation.  They  claimed  that  high  caseloads  and  a  lack  of experts prevented  attorneys \nfrom  interviewing,  investigating,  researching,  engaging  in  motion practice,  providing \nadvice  and  preparing properly  for trial.  The  court  concluded  that  the  requirement  in  an \nattorney  ineffectiveness  case  that  the  plaintiff demonstrate  prejudice  is  \"inappropriate  for \na civil  suit  seeking  prospective  relief.”  Jd.  at  1016-17. \nIn  Wallace  v.  Kern,  a  class  of incarcerated  indigent  felony  defendants  brought  a \npre-trial  systemic  challenge  to  the  delivery of legal  services.  392  F.Supp.  834  (E.D.N.Y,), \nrev'd on  abstention grounds,  482  F.2d  621  (2d  Cir.  1973).  The  court  found  a  pattern  of \nfailing  to  adequately prepare,  investigate  and  confer  with  clients,  primarily  because  of \nexcessive  caseloads.  Jd.  In  concluding  that  grounds  existed to  issue  a  class-wide \ninjunction  limiting  attorney caseloads,  the  Court  stated: \nNone  of the  reasons  which  support  the  imposition  of strict  standards  in \npost-conviction  cases  is  applicable  in  th[is]  posture...  The  hesitancy to \nindulge  in  second-guessing  previously made  decisions  is  not  an  obstacle. \nWhat  is  at  issue  is  not  how  to  investigate,  what  plea  to  accept.  which \n10 \n  \n \nwitness to  call,  what  defenses  to  put  forward,  how  to  examine  and \ncross-examine,  but whether  the Legal  Aid  attorneys  are  so  overburdened \nthat  they  cannot  even  make  the  necessary  decisions. \nId.  at  845-846.  The  critical  inquiry  in  Wallace  was  not  the  performance  of Legal  Aid \nattorneys  in  individual  cases,  but  the  excessive  caseloads  and  lack  of support  routinely \npreventing  attorneys  from  performing  the  tasks  needed  to  prepare  an  adequate  defense. \nId.  at  863-847.  The  Court  found  that the  plaintiffs  established  a  likelihood  of harm based \non  the  caseload  size  and  lack  of resources  of the public  defender  system,  and  the  public \ndefenders’  inability  to  adhere  to  the  ABA  Standards  on  Criminal  Justice.  See  id.  at  847. \nThe  Arizona  Supreme Coust  found that  systemic  deficiencies  in the  Mohave \nCounty  public  defender  system  created  a presumption  that  indigent  defendants were  not \nreceiving effective  assistance  of counsel.  State  v.  Smith,  681  P.2d  1374,  1381  (Ariz. \n1984).  In Smith,  public  defenders were  not reimbursed  for  costs  of investigators, \nparalegals  or  secretaries,  caseloads  were  excessive,  and  cases  were  assigned without \nregard to  an  attorney's  competency  or  the  complexity  of the  case.  Jd.  at  1378,  1380.  The \nCourt noted  that  “[t]he  insidiousness  of overburdening defense  counsel  is  that  it can  result \nin  concealing  from  the  courts,  and  particularly the  appellate  courts,  the nature  and  extent \nof damage  that  is  done  to  defendants  by their  attorneys’  excessive  caseloads.”  Jd.  at  1381. \nAn  attorney working  under  such conditions,  the  court  concluded,  could  not  \"adequately \nrepresent  all  his  clients  properly  and  be  reasonably  effective.\"  Jd. \nSimilarly,  in  State  v.  Peart,  the  Supreme  Court  of Louisiana held  that  the \noperation  of the  New  Orleans public  defender  system  created  a presumption  of ineffective \nassistance.  621  So.2d  780  (La.  1993).  Peart's  public  defender  filed  a pre-trial  motion \nclaiming that  his  caseload prevented  him  from  providing  effective  assistance.  Jd.  at  784. \n11 \n   \nThe  trial  court  found  that  while  Peart was  receiving effective  assistance,  excessive \ncaseloads  and  insufficient  support  prevented his  attorney  and  other public  defenders  from \nproviding  all  clients  with  such  assistance.  fd.  at  785  n.4,  790.  The  Supreme  Court \naffirmed,  concluding  that  counsel  for many  indigent  defendants  are  “so  overburdened  as \nto  be  effectively  unqualified.”  Jd.  at  789.  The  Court  found  that the  integrity  of the \nadversarial  process  required  the  Court  to  consider  these  claims  pre-trial: \nIf the  trial  court  has  sufficient  information  before  trial,  the yudge  can  most \nefficiently  inquire  into  any inadequacy  and  attempt  to  remedy  it.  Thus, \ntreating  ineffective  assistance  claims  before  trial  where  possible will \nfurther the  interests  of judicial  economy.  (citation  omitted]  It will  also \nprotect  defendants’  constitutional  rights,  and  preserve  the  integnity  of the \ntrial  process. \nId.  at  787. \nC.  The  Attorney  General’s  Position  is  Ilogical:  Prospective,  Prophylactic \nRelief is  Necessary  to  Remedy  Mississippi’s  Systemically  Deficient \nIndigent  Defense  System \nA  prospective  claim  of ineffective  assistance  alleges  that  counse}  is  unable  to \nsubject  the  state’s  case  to  meaningful  adversarial  testing.  Because  such  a  claim  calls  into \nquestion  the  integrity  of the  adversarial  process  itself,  it may  be  raised  prospectively. \nWhen the  defects  undermine  the  adequacy or  integrity of the  adversarial  process,  the \nharm  stems  from  the  state’s  action  (or  inaction)  and  not  the  performance  of individual \ncounsel.  Therefore,  the  relief must  be  systemic  and  prophylactic. \nAs  courts  around  the  country  have  recognized,  an ongoing,  system-wide threat to \nthe  proceedings  of thousands  of indigent  defendants  cannot be  addressed  or  corrected \nwithin the  framework  of individual post-trial petitions.  The  suggestion  that  an  indigent \ndefendant must  wait  until  after he  has been harmed  and  then  request  the  court  to  eliminate \n12 \n  \n \nthe  cause  of the  harm  years  after the  defendant  is  confined  to  a prison  cell  cannot \nreasonably  be  said  to  be  adequate.  A plaintiff is  not required  to  wait  until  his \nconstitutional  rights  are  violated  before  seeking  relief,  and  an  indigent person  does  not \nhave to  wait  until  he  is  wrongly  convicted  to  claim  ineffective  assistance  of counsel.  See, \ne.g.,  Holloway,  435  U.S.  at  488-90, \nMoreover,  the  remedy in  a  system  ineffectiveness  claim is  fundamentally  different \nthan  an  attorney ineffectiveness  claim.  In  the  Quitman  County Board’s  challenge  to  the \nState’s  indigent  defense  system,  for example,  if the  court  ultimately  finds  that  the  State’s \nsystem  undermines  the  adversarial  process  and  deprives  indigent  defendants  of their right \nto  effective  assistance,  the  Court  would  identify,  and require  the  State  to  correct,  the \nsystemic  deficiencies.  Like  in  Gideon,  Herring,  and  the  other  system  ineffectiveness \ncases,  the  Court would  award relief in the  form  of a per  se rule,  without regard to the  facts \nin  a particular  case  and  without  any analysis  of prejudice.  Most  importantly,  the  Court \nwould  not  be  required  to  rule  on  the  merits  of,  or  enjoin,  any pending  proceeding. \nInstead,  relief would  include  a requirement  that  the  State provide  public  defenders  with \nadequate  investigative,  expert  and  support  services. \nThis  remedy  is  consistent  with  the  Court’s  proper role.  The judiciary  is \nresponsible  for  ensuring  that  indigent persons  receive  effective  assistance  of counsel. \nSee,  é.g., Powell,  287  U.S.  at  71,  73.  Other  courts  have  held  that  when  systemic \ndeficiencies  deprive  indigent  persons  of effective  assistance,  and  thereby  adversely  affect \nthe  court's  ability to  satisfy its  constitutional mandates,  the  court  has  the  inherent \nauthority,  and  in  fact,  the  duty,  \"to  fashion  a remedy which  will  promote  the  orderly  and \nexpeditious  administration  of justice.\"  State  v.  Peart,  621  So.2d  at  791. \n13 \n \nThis  Court  similarly  has  declared  that  it  has  the  inherent  authority to  safeguard  the \ncourt’s  operation if the  Legislature  should  fail  to  do  so.  See  Wilson  v.  State,  574  So.2d \n1338  (Miss.  1990)  (citing  Hosford  v.  State,  525  So.2d  789  (Miss.  1988)). \n...  If [the Legislature] fails  to  fulfill  a constitutional  obligation  to  enable \nthe  judicial  branch  to  operate  independently and  effectively,  then  it  has \nviolated  its  Constitutional  mandate,  and  the judicial  branch has  the \nauthority  as  well  as  the  duty  to  see  that  the  courts  do  not  atrophy.  No  court \ncreated  by the  Constitution  is  required  to  accept  conditions  which  prevent \nit  operating  independently and  effectively.  Such  court  also  has  the  duty \nunder  our  governmental  system  to  protect  its  own  integrity.  It  likewise  has \nthe  inherent  authority  as  part  of a  separate  and  co-equal  branch  to  make \nsuch  orders  to  insure  that independence  and  integrity. \nSee  Hosford,  525  So.2d  at  797-98  (emphasis  added). \nHere  the  State  is  failing  to  fulfill  a constitutional  obligation.  This  Court  must  act \nto  remedy  the  State’s  systemically deficient indigent  defense  system.” \nCONCLUSION \nThe  State  of Mississippi’s  failure  to  provide  the  personnel  and  resources  necessary \nto  secure  indigent  defendants  adequate  legal  representation  violates  the  effective \nassistance  of counsel  required under  Article  3,  Section  26  (1890)  of the  Mississippi \nConstitution.  As  a result  of the  systemic  deficiencies  and  the  consequent  ineffective \n  \n*  The  Attorney  General disputes  Quitman  County’s  standing  to  raise  a  systemic  challenge \nto  the  State’s  system  of indigent  defense.  See  AG  Brief at 28-36.  Under  Mississippi’s \nliberal  standing  rules,  however,  both  Quitman  County  and  Mr.  Van  Slyke  have  standing \nto  raise  such  a  claim.  In Mississippi,  individuals  have  standing  to  sue  “when  they  assert  a \ncolorable  interest  in  the  subject  matter  of the  litigation  or  experience  an  adverse  effect \nfrom  the  conduct  of the  defendant,  or  as  otherwise  provided  by  law.”  Fordice  v.  Bryan, \n651  So.  2d  998,  1003  (Miss.  1995).  Here the  State  has  obligated  both  Quitman  County \nand  Mr.  Van  Slyke  to  participate  in  an  indigent  defense  system  which  fails  to  ensure  that \nindigent  defendants  receive  the  effective  assistance  of counsel  to  which  they  are \nconstitutionally  entitled.  Therefore  both  Quitman  County and  Mr.  Van  Slyke,  on  behalf \nof himself as  the  part-time public  defender  and  on  behalf of all  indigent  defendants  in \nForrest  County,  have  a  colorable  interest  in  the  subject  of indigent  defense  and  are \nadversely  affected  by the  State’s  unconstitutional  system. \n14 \n  \n \nrepresentation  provided  to  indigent  defendants,  Mississippi’s  courts  are  unable  to  operate \nindependently and  effectively,  and  have  been  reduced  to  a  supplicant  of the Mississippi \nlegislature,  in violation  of the  constitutional  mandate  for  a  separation  of powers  and the \nindependence  of the  state judiciary  guaranteed  by Article  1,  Section  1  (1890)  of the \nMississippi  Constitution. \nRespectfully  Submitted, \nMbd  Meh  fic \nMichael  Adelman  /   ° \nMississippi  Bar No.  1153 \nADELMAN  &  STEINER,  P.A. \nP.O.

      "text": "FILED\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSISSIPPI\nAUG.-\nOFFICE OFTHE CLERK\nQUITMAN COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI\nSUPREME COURT\nCOURT OF APPEALS\nPlaintiff-Appellant,\nVS. No. 2003-SA-02-56\"_\nSTATE OF MISSISSIPPI, Haley Barbour,\nin his official capacity as GOVERNOR,\nand James Hood, in his official capacity as\nATTORNEY GENERAL,\nDefendants-Appellees,\nOn Appeal From The Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial District In and For\nQuitman County, Mississippi\nBRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE DISTRICT\nATTORNEY ELEANOR J. PETERSON\nThe criminal justice system is founded on two basic tenets: (1) accountability and\n(2) due process. As officers of the court and public officials, prosecutors are concerned\nabout both. First, prosecutors have a responsibility to hold individuals accountable for\ncriminal activity and to protect the public by removing guilty defendants from the streets\nand deterring other would-be criminals. This duty includes a duty not to convict and\nincarcerate innocent defendants. Second, prosecutors have a responsibility to uphold the\nintegrity of the system. This requires prosecutors to respect the defendants'\nconstitutional rights to due process, including where appropriate: lawful searches and\nseizures based upon probable case; reading of defendants' rights before ,detention and/or\ninterrogation; speedy arraignment and trial; and access to a competent and adequate\n\ndefenselawyerandanappeal.If anyofthesebasicconstitutionallymandatedrightsare\nviolated,it istheprosecutor'saswell asthedefenselawyer'sdutytothecourtandpublic\ntopreventanunlawfulconviction.\nInStringer v. State, 500 So. 2d 928 (Miss. 1987), the Mississippi Supreme Court\nstated that all prosecutors are:\nduty bound and sworn by oath to uphold the laws of the\nState of Mississippi. We are thus entrusted with the\nresponsibility of ensuring that the criminal justice system of\nthis State works to guarantee that every defendant brought\nbefore its tribunals receive a fair and impartial trial.\nld. at 930. In Stringer, this Court reversed a death penalty sentence and made very clear\nthat prosecutors and trial judges, as well as defense counsel, have a responsibility to be\nmindful of the defendant's rights to due process. This responsibility is heightened when\nthe prosecutor is aware that defense counsel has inadequate resources to provide\nconstitutionally effective assistance of counsel. Without effective assistance of defense\ncounsel, the likelihood of conviction of an innocent defendant increases dramatically.\nIneffective assistance of defense counsel also increases the likelihood that illegally\nobtained evidence may be used against a defendant whose lawyer did not have the time,\nresources, or competence to move to exclude such evidence. This ultimately undermines\nthe credibility of the system of law enforcement. For these reasons, every prosecutor in\nMississippi has a unique interest in ensuring that indigent defendants are represented by\ncompetent and constitutionally effective counsel.\n\nI. A STATE-FUNDED FULL-TIME PUBLIC DEFENDER SYSTEM WOULD\nINCREASE THE DEPENDABILITY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE\nSYSTEM IN MISSISSIPPI\nA. The Current Method Of Funding The Criminal Justice System In\nMississippi Results In Highly Disparate Resources Available To The\nProsecution And Defense\nThere is a great disparity between the resources provided by the State to the\nprosecution and the resources available to public defenders from counties. District\nAttorneys and their offices are funded by State appropriations and also have discretion to\nuse bad check proceeds to cover their office expenses. Unlike the usually part-time\npublic defenders, the District Attorneys are full time. Multiple offices represent the State\nin criminal matters - the District Attorneys prosecute felonies in Circuit Court, county\nprosecutors handle matters in Justice Court, and the Attorney General's office is\nresponsible for appeals. In contrast, the public defenders are required to represent their\nclients at all three levels, in Justice Court, in Circuit Court and on appeal.\nThe District Attorneys are aided by multiple full time assistant district attorneys,\nstaff investigators, secretarial support, and often a victim assistance coordinator and a bad\ncheck fund administrator. District Attorneys use the investigative resources of local\npolice departments, sheriffs' departments, the Gaming Commission, the Bureau of\nNarcotics, the Highway Patrol and the Crime Lab. Furthermore, the Attorney General's\noffice provides numerous training sessions and extensive written training materials for\nDistrict Attorneys and county prosecutors and their staffs.\nPart-time public defenders usually must take on additional private employment to\nmake a living and are not provided with any of the resources provided to State\nprosecutors. Rather, the public defenders are expected to find, fund, and staff their own\n\nofficeaccommodationsandresearchfacilities.

Prosecutorsltave Specific Responsibilities To Ensure\nDefendants Receive Effective Assistance of Counsel\nAs an officer of the Court and the State, every prosecutor in the State of\nMississippi must take a special oath of office to faithfully support the Constitution of the\nUnited States and Constitution of the State of Mississippi. Moreover, each prosecutor is\n\nboundbycodesofethicalconduct,includingtheMississippiRulesofProfessional\nConduct,\"SpecialResponsibilitiesofaProsecutor.\"TheConstitutionsandethical\ncanonsrequireprosecutorstobemindfulofdefendantsr'ights,includingtheir\nconstitutionalrightto receiveeffectiveassistanceofdefensecounsel.Theofficial\ncommentarytotheMississippiRulesofProfessionaCl onductregardingprosecutors\nstates:\nAprosecutorhastheresponsibilityofaministerofjustice\nandnotsimplythatofanadvocateT. hisresponsibility\ncarrieswith itspecificobligationstoseethatthedefendant\nisaccordedprocedurajlustice....\nComment, Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.8.\nThis obligation puts prosecutors in an untenable position when defendants are not\nprovided with effective assistance of defense counsel. In that case, the prosecution is not\nfree to zealously present the State's case, confident that the defense will zealously and\ncompetently present its case and the jury will make an informed decision. Rather, when\ndefense counsel has an excessive caseload, inadequate or no staffing and administrative\nsupport, inadequate compensation and resources or a lack of proper training and\nsupervision, the prosecution must step in and act both as prosecutor and ensure that an\nadequate defense is provided.\nThe prosecutor must always be mindful of these obligations to reduce the\nlikelihood that an innocent defendant is convicted. Moreover, prosecutors are aware of at\nleast two other very important reasons why effective assistance of defense counsel is\nessential. First, the public's faith in the justice system depends on strict adherence to the\ndue process rights of every defendant.

A STATE-FUNDED FULL-TIME PUBLIC DEFENDER SYSTEM WOULD\nREDUCE FISCAL WASTE BY INCREASING THE LISKELI_OOD TI_AT\nDEFENDANTS MOVE TI/ROUGI_ THE SYSTEM IN TIlE MOST COST-\nEFFECTIVE, TIMELY MANNER\nMindful of their duties to the court, public, and the defendant, when there is an\nenormous disparity of resources between prosecution and defense, prosecutors must\nspend more time evaluating the defense's case and cannot focus on prosecution. Being a\nsuccessful prosecutor is not to \"win a case, but [to ensure] that justice [is] done.\"\nBerger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78-88 (1935). Given the burdens placed on law\nenforcement to make quick arrests when crimes are committed, the natural desire of\n\npotential witnesses to want criminal accountability, and the incentives often placed on\npersons with criminal records to make deals, in some cases the wrong person will be tried\non criminal charges.\nIt is never a prosecutor's job or desire to convict the wrong person. Accordingly,\nwhen defendants are represented by counsel with inadequate resources or time to explore\npossible defenses, interview potential witnesses, and evaluate whether there are\nprocedural or other grounds for dismissal, 'the prosecution also must fill the role of\nassistant defense counsel. This takes time, resources and energy away from the\nprosecutor's duty to represent the state zealously in prosecuting. If the State implements\na state-funded full-time public defender system, and prosecutors throughout the State can\nfocus on presenting their cases, ultimately this would save the State enormous resources.\nIt is regrettable to see the resources that have been wasted when cases are reversed on\nappeal because of ineffective counsel and even when cases are given extra scrutiny by the\nappellate courts because of questionable assistance of counsel, even when error\nultimately is found \"harmless.\"\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse the Circuit Court's judgment\nand order implementation of a statewide and state-funded full-time public defender\nsystem.\n\nDated:July %'_ ,2004\nRespectfullysubmitted,\nEleanorJ.P_'terson\nMississippiBarNo._C_'-/'_-\nHindsCountyDistrict Attorney\nP.O.Box22747\nJacksonM, S 39225\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nThis is to certify that I have caused to be served on this /_{,OTv\" day of July,\n2004 a true and correct copy of the foregoing Motion for Leave to File Brief of Amicus\nCuriae District Attorney Eleanor J.

Amici's experiences have led to their support of adequately resourced, full-time\nindigent defense systems to enable states to provide fair trials for the criminally accused. Amici\nI\n\"know first-hand the difficulties in determining the culpability of a defendant and reaching a just\nI outcome when counsel for the defense has not had the time or resources to represent the accused\nadequately. The similar experiences of judges in other states and counties throughout the nation\nI\nhave led judges to participate in creating indigent defense reform in many states. Amici believe\nI that the establishment of a statewide, full-time indigent defense system will improve the\nefficiency and accuracy of the justice system in Quitman County and throughout the State of\nI\nMississippi.\nI ARGUMENT:\nI. JUDGES HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ENSURING ADEQUATE\nI REPRESENTATION IN CRIMINAL CASES\nArticle Three of the Mississippi Constitution provides that \"[i]n all criminal\nI\nprosecutions the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself or counsel, or both, to demand\nI\nI\nAmici are Reuben V. Anderson, Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court, 1985-1991 ; Rhoda B. Billings, Justice\nof the North Carolina Supreme Court, 1985-1986, Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, 1986; Charles\nI\nB.

[to]\nI\na speedy and public trial. ''2 In Triplett v. State, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled, \"[w]e hold\nI today that the Mississippi Constitution's right to counsel embraces all rights guaranteed to a\ncriminally accused defendant by the Sixth Amendment. ''3 The Court also has held, in Johnson v.\nI\nState, that the right to a fair trial by an impartial jury is a fundamental right provided by both the\nI state and federal constitutions. 4\nFederal law also mandates that indigent defendants be provided with adequate\nI\ncounsel to carry out their right to a fair and speedy trial. As early as 1932, the United States\nI Supreme Court examined the nature of the right to counsel, holding in Powell v.Alabama that\nthe defendants had not been afforded the right to counsel where \"until the very morning of the\n!\ntrial no lawyer had been named or definitely designated to represent the defendants. ''5 The Court\nI addressed the difference between having a person who simply stands next to the defendant at\ntrial, or, as is often the case in Mississippi, as the defendant pleads guilty, as opposed to having\nI\nan individual that will \"accord[] the right of counsel in any substantial sense. ''6 The Court wrote:\nI\n-' Miss. Consc art. 3, §26.\ni 3 Triplett v. State, 666 So.2d 1356. 1358 (Miss. 1995) (holding that Triplett received ineffective assistance of\ncounsel where counsel failed to file a motion for continuance and acontinuance was necessary).\n4 See 476 So.2d 1195, 1209 (Miss. 1985). In that decision, the court stated that\nI\nA fair trial is, after all, the reason we have our system ofjustice; it is a paramount\ndistinction between free and totalitarian societies .... The right to a fair trial by an\nI impartial jury is fundamental and essential to our form of government. It is a right\nguaranteed by both the federal and the state constitutions.\nld. See also Littlejohn v.State, 593 So.2d 20, 23 (Miss. 1992) (\"An accused isentitled to be assisted by an\nI\nattorney, whether retained or appointed, who plays the role necessary to ensure that the trial isfair.\").\n5 287 U.S. 45, 56 (1932).\nI\n6 ld. at 58. The Supreme Court held that \"[u]nder the circumstances disclosed.., defendants were not accorded\nthe right of counsel in any substantial sense.\" ld.\ni\n2\nI\n\nI\nI\nduring perhaps the most critical period of the proceedings against these\nI defendants, that is to say, from the time of their arraignment until the beginning of\ntheir trial, when consultation, thorough-going investigation and preparation were\nvitally important, the defendants did not have the aid of counsel in any real sense,\nI although they were as much entitled to such aid during that period as at the trial\nitself. 7\nI In Gideon v. Wainwright the Supreme Court extended the holding in Powell v.\nAlabama and described the scenario of a criminal defendant's facing trial without an attorney:\nI\nLeft without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a proper charge,\nand convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or\nI otherwise inadmissible .... He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step\nin the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty he faces the\ndanger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence. 8\nI\nWhen a defendant appears before the court without the aid of an attorney who has prepared and\nI is ready to make objections and advocate for the defendant throughout the proceedings, it hinders\nthe ability of judges to provide a fair trial or accurate outcome.\nI\nJust last term, in Wiggins v. Smith, the Supreme Court emphasized that\nI conducting a reasonable investigation of the facts of the defendant's case is an essential element\nto providing effective assistance of counsel. 9 The Court stated, \"'strategic choices made after\nI\nless than complete investigation are reasonable' only to the extent that 'reasonable professional\nI judgments support the limitations on investigation. '''l° The Fifth Circuit also has held that\nI\nI\n7 Id. at 57 (.emphasis added).\nI\ns 372 U.S. 335, 345 (quoting Powell, 287 U.S. at 69).\nI 9 See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (2003).\n_o ld. at 2539 (citation omitted).\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nessential to adequate assistance is \"a reasonably substantial, independent investigation into the\nI\ncircumstances and the law from which potential defenses may be derived. ''_\nI As early as 1964, in the wake of Gideon v. Wainwright, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt reversed the conviction of a defendant convicted and sentenced without legal\nI\nrepresentation, writing that \"[t]he assistance of counsel is one of the safeguards of the Sixth\n! Amendment deemed necessary to insure fundamental human rights of life and liberty .... The\nSixth Amendment stands as a constant admonition that if the constitutional safeguards it\nI\nprovides be lost, justice will not still be done. ''_2 The Mississippi Supreme Court has held that\nI the right to counsel provides defendants with a right to an attorney who knows the governing law\nand relevant facts of the case before going to trial or pleading his client guilty. In Ward v. State,\nI\nthe Court held that effective assistance of counsel requires a lawyer who is familiar with the\nI\ngoverning law of the case; a lawyer unversed in the facts or the law of a case is unable to provide\ncompetent representation in advising a client to plead guilty._3 Meeting this legal standard\nI\nnecessitates that counsel for the indigent have the resources to investigate the facts and law of the\nI case.\nBy all national standards, the county-based indigent defense system fails to\nI\nprovide the essential tools of an adequate defense. As the trial record reflects, Quitman County's\nI\nLockett v. Anderson, 230 F.3d 695,714 (5th Cir. 2000); see also Baldwin v. Maggio, 704 F.2d 1325, 1332-33\nI _5th Cir. 1983) (finding counsel ineffective in failing to conduct adequate investigations).\nConn v. State, 170 So.2d 20, 22 (Miss. 1964) (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458,462 (1938)).\nI\nWard v. State, 708 So.2d lI, 14-15 (Miss 1998); see also Harris v. State, 806 So.2d 1127, 1130-31 (Miss.\n2002\") (holding that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel admitted under oath that\nhe advised defendant to enter a guilty plea, after which point counsel planned to investigate the case, and\nI advised defendant that he could legally withdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing); State v. Tokman, 564\nSo.2d 1339, 1342 (Miss. 1990) (\"The failure by Tokman's counsel to conduct any investigation at all can be\ncharacterized as an \"identifiable lapse.'\").\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nattorneys for the indigent routinely waive important stages of criminal proceedings. Attorneys\nI\noften only meet with clients in groups and within earshot of the prosecutor and judge, losing the\nI potential for meaningful attorney-client communications. Lawyers for the indigent in Quitman\nCounty do not interview witnesses, hire investigators, examine evidence, or conduct any\nI\ninvestigation of the cases. Instead of independently constructing a factually based defense, they\nI simply rely upon the prosecution's file. Also absent from the defense provided is motion\npractice, with no substantive motions filed in 83% of Quitman County defenders' cases from\nI\n1998-2000. Forensic testing, psychiatric evaluation, and retaining of experts are also not\nI provided in Quitman County.\nIn the experience of amici, the adequacy of representation for the indigent\nI\nimproves significantly when representation is provided by public defenders who are devoted to\nI\nindigent cases, adequately paid, and given access to investigators and other support staff to assist\nwith their work. At present, only three of Mississippi's eighty-two counties have one or more\nI\nfull-time public defenders.t4 National institutions, including the American Bar Association, state\nI\nin their standards for criminal justice that having a full-time staff devoted to criminal defense\nbest ensures that adequate counsel will be provided. The American Bar Association Standards\nI\nstate that \"[d]efense organizations should be staffed with full-time attorneys. All such attorneys\nI\nshould be prohibited from engaging in the private practice of law. ''15 An economic study of\nI\nAssembly Line Justice: Mississippi's Indigent Defense Crisis 6(NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund,\nInc. ed., 2003) (noting that among the seventy-nine other counties in Mississippi, the vast majority \"contract\nI\nwith part-time defenders who maintain private practices, or appoint private attorneys to represent poor\ndefendants\").\nI ABA Standards For Criminal Justice: Providit, g Defense Services, Standard 5-4.2 (A.B.A., 3d ed. 1992),\navailable at National Study Comm'n on\nDefense Servs._ Natrl Legal Aid &Defender Ass'n, Guidelines for Legal Defense Systems inthe United States,\nStandard 2.9 (1976) (\"Defender Directors and staff attorneys should be full-time employees, prohibited from\nI\n5\ni\n\nI\nI\nMississippi's indigent defense systems concluded that full-time public defenders provide better\ni\nrepresentation for Mississippi's poor than alternative models of indigent defense. 16 Similarly,\nI after conducting a two-year-investigation, the Georgia Blue Ribbon Commission on Indigent\nDefense concluded that a public defender's office presents the best method of representation, t7\n!\nStudies have also concluded that defendants with private counsel, often full-time defense\nI attorneys with greater resources, are sentenced to time in prison or jail half as often as defendants\nwho are publicly defended receive a sentence of time in prison or jail, suggesting that such\nI\npunishments are more proportionate to the crimes for which the defendants are convicted. For\nI example, a study conducted in Harris County, Texas documented that out of 30,000 felony\nfilings, 58% of defendants with appointed counsel were sentenced to jail or prison whereas only\nI\n29% of defendants with private counsel were incarcerated, t8\nI\nWhen defendants are represented by counsel that puts forth a basic defense, by\ninvestigating the facts and advocating for the defendant, the fate of the individual defendant is\nI\nnot the only outcome impacted upon.

The 1999 study concluded that 58% of defendants with appointed counsel and 29% of\nI defendants with private counsel served time.

JUDICIAL SUPPORT IS OFTEN CENTRAL TO SUCCESSFUL INDIGENT\nI\nDEFENSE REFORM.\nJudges have played active roles in securing reform in indigent defense systems\nI\nwhere the judges could no longer ensure that swift and accurate justice was provided in their\nI\ncourts because of inadequate counsel for the poor. Judges have repeatedly decided cases to\nI change the indigent defense system in counties and towns where the constitutionally required\nlevel of representation was not being provided. 24 In addition, some judges have participated in\nI\nstatewide Blue Ribbon Commissions (task forces comprised of judges, prosecutors, defense\nI attorneys and other community leaders) with the objective of assessing what reform measures, if\nany, were needed in county and state criminal defense systemsY Indigent defense reform efforts\nI\nin Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas offer useful examples.\ni As of 2003, the State of Georgia provided only eleven percent of the funding of\nindigent defense in all of its counties. 26 Facing plentiful evidence that the state was not meeting\nI\nSee Cheryl A. Whitney, Note, Non-Stranger, Non-Consensual Sexual Assaults: Changing Legislation to Ensure\nI That Acts Are Criminally Punished, 27 Rutgers L.J. 427, 437 (1996) (finding that decreased confidence in the\njustice system is a likely factor for the under-reporting of crimes by sexual assault victims).\nSee State v. Peart, 621 So.2d 780, 790-791 (La. 1993) (holding that excessive caseloads and insufficient\n!\nsupport services for New Orleans public defenders created a rebuttable presumption that indigent defendants\nwere not provided constitutionally adequate assistance of counsel); State v. Smith, 681 P.2d 1374, 1384 (Ariz.\n1984) (holding that Mohave County's system of offering contract for representing the county's indigent to\nI whoever made the lowest bid, with no inquiry into attorney's competency, raises \"an inference that the\nprocedure resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel, which inference the state will have the burden of\nrebutting\").\nI\nSee. e.g., Richard W.

Republican\nI Governor Sonny Perdue signed the Act, which mandates the creation of forty-nine public\ndefender's offices, one for each judicial circuit in Georgia. 3° These offices will match the\nI\nnumber of prosecutors' offices that are in place and are designed to demonstrate the state's\nI commitment to provide indigent defendants with representation that can stand up to the services\nprovided by prosecutors.\nI\nJudges in Georgia continue to work on reform of the State's indigent defense\n!\nsystem.

When compared with eighteen similar\nstates, Louisiana ranked last in expenditures per case and expenditures per capita on indigent\nI\ndefense. 34\nI In 1993, the Louisiana Supreme Court heard the case of State v.

In the\nfirst appeal, the Court allowed Quitman County to proceed with its complaint that the State's\nI\n\"county-based system\" for providing legal representation to indigent defendants violates Art.\n!\n3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution. State of Mississippi v. Quitman Count),, 807 So.2d\nI 401,402 (Miss. 2001). There is a difference, though, between alleging facts sufficient to\nsurvive a Rule 12 motion and actually proving those facts at trial. As the Court stated in its\nI\nfirst opinion, \"Whether Quitman County can prove [its] allegations at a full trial on the merits\nI will be determined upon remand.\" Id. at 410. That trial has been completed, and the detailed\nopinion of the Circuit Court of Quitman County documents the gulf that exists between the\nI\nfactual allegations in the complaint and the evidence presented at trial. The court found that\nI\nthe County had not met its burden of proving that the current statutory scheme for providing\nindigent defense is unconstitutional, and the judgment should be affirmed.\ni\nI\nI\ni\nI\n,I\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\nI\nDid the Circuit Court apply the correct standard for determining whether the Quitman\nCounty public defenders are regularly providing constitutionally ineffective assistance\nI\nof counsel?\nI\nII. Did the Circuit Court clearly err when it found that Quitman County is able to pay for\na constitutionally sufficient indigent defense system and that the County's financial\nI troubles are not attributable to indigent defense costs?\nI III. Did the Circuit Court abuse its discretion when it (a) did not allow one of Quitman\nCounty's experts to offer an opinion that was so vague that it would not have been\nhelpful to the trier of fact, and (b) allowed judges to testify about how the Quitman\nI County indigent defense system operates?\nI\nIV. Is the Circuit Court's decision against the great weight of the evidence?\ni\nW. Did the Circuit Court evince bias or improperly inject a personal opinion into the\nproceedings when it stated that the Legislature should consider a statewide, state-\nfunded public defenders' office, even though the court had no authority to grant that\ni\nrelief in light of the facts proven at trial?\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nI\nProcedural History\nAppellant Quitman County filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief against\nI\nthe State of Mississippi, the Governor, and the Attorney General. Rec. 8. The County alleged\nI\nthat Mississippi's statutes requiring the counties to provide legal services for indigent criminal\nI defendants are unconstitutional. Rec. 9. The County sought a declaratory judgment that the\nState has breached its duty to provide effective assistance of counsel, in violation of article 3,\nI\nsection 26 of the Mississippi Constitution, and an injunction to compel the state legislature to\nI create a statewide, state-funded public defenders' office. Rec. 17-18. After the Circuit Court\nof Quitman County denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, this Court granted permission\nI\nfor an interlocutory appeal. See State of Mississippi v. Quitman County, 807 So.2d 401,402\nI\n(Miss. 2001) (\"Quitman Coun.ty f').\nThe Court held that Quitman County had standing to bring this action and had pleaded\nI\nfacts which, if assumed to be true, were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss under Rule\nI\n12(b)(6) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. See id. at 405,409. The Court stressed\nthat its decision \"'should not be construed as stating a position\" on the constitutionality, of the\nI\ncurrent funding scheme: \"Whether Quitman County can prove [its] allegations at a full trial on\nI\nthe merits will be determined upon remand.\" Id. at 406, 410.\nI A bench trial was held in the Circuit Court of Quitman Couni3' from April 29 through\nMay 6, 2003. Rec. 310; RE at tab 3. After the parties had submitted proposed findings of fact\nI\nand conclusions of law, the court issued a thorough opinion eonclud!ng that Quitman County\nL\nI\nhad not met its burden of proving that the funding mechanism established by statute had led to\nI\ni\n\nI\nI\nsystemic ineffective assistance of counsel in Quitman County and throughout the state. Rec.\nI\n335 [Op. ¶ 83]; RE at tab 3. The Circuit Court's final judgment was entered on November 10,\n2003, and Quitman County filed a timely notice of appeal. Rec. 338, 340.\nI\nStatement of Facts\nI\nThe Mississippi Constitution grants indigent criminal defendants the right to receive\neffective legal representation at the public's expense. See, e.g., Quitman County I, 807 So.2d\nI\nat 407; Rec. 324 [Op. ¶54]. While the State has a duty to provide effective assistance of\nI\ncounsel, the State is free to experiment and find the most suitable method for delivering those\nI services.\nThe Circuit Court heard evidence regarding the three primary methods that state and\nI\nlocal governments use to provide counsel for indigent defendants: (a) public defender offices\nI with a salaried staff of attorneys, who are employed either full-time or part-time and are paid\neither directly by the government entity or through public or private non-profit organizations;\nI\n(b) assigned counsel programs in which attorneys are appointed on a case-by-case basis; and\nI\n(c) contract attorney systems in which private attorneys contract with governmental entities to\nprovide legal representation to indigent defendants for a specified amount of money and for a\nI\nspecified period of time. Rec. 323 [Op. ¶ 50]; DX 1, p. 3. State and local governments often\nI\ncombine these approaches, and \"[e]ven within specific program types, the organization of the\nI programs varie[s].\" DX 1, p. 2.\nNot only are the indigent-defense delivery systems varied, b3a! so too are the funding\nI\nmechanisms. Twenty-one states provide all of the funding for indigent defense, twenty states\nI rely on a combination of state and county funds, and nine states rely solely on funding from\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\ncounty governments. Rec. 322-23 [Op. ¶¶ 49-50]; DX 1, pp. 1-3.\nI\nMississippi, like many other states, relies on a combination of state and county funds.\nRec. 315 [Op. ¶ 17]. In this State, the type of delivery system and the source of funds depends\nI\nupon whether the indigent defendant is being prosecuted for a capital or a non-capital offense.\nI\nld. The Mississippi Capital Defense Litigation Act of 2000, see Miss. Code Ann. §§ 99-18-1,\net seq., created a statewide Office of Capital Defense Counsel \"for the purpose of providing\nI\nrepresentation to indigent parties under indictment for death penalty eligible offenses .... \"\nI\nMiss. Code Ann. § 99-18-5. The director of the Office testified at trial that his attorneys were\nI serving as trial counsel in twenty-five capital cases and were assisting county public defenders\nin several others. Rec. 316-17 [Op. ¶¶ 20-21]; Tr. 593. He testified that the long-term goal\nI\nwas for the Office to serve as trial counsel in all capital litigation in the State. Tr. 600. The\nI\nCapital Defense Litigation Act also gives trial courts the power to appoint local counsel for an\nindigent defendant in addition to, or in lieu of, attorneys from the Office of Capital Defense\ni\nCounsel, with the costs of appointed counsel borne by the State. Miss. Code Ann. § 99-18-I 9.\nI\nWhile the Office of Capital Defense Counsel represents indigent defendants at trial\nand on direct appeal, a separate Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel handles petitions\nI\ntbr post-conviction relief. See Miss. Code Ann. §§ 99-18-7 & 99-39-105; Rec. 317 [Op. ]]22].\nI\nThe Mississippi Capital Post-Conviction Counsel Act, Miss. Code Ann. §§ 99-39-101, et seq.,\nI provides that all expenses for litigation and investigation will be borne by the State, not by the\ncounty where the criminal proceedings began. See Miss. Code Ann. § 99-39-107. Thus, with\nI\nthe passage of the Capital Defense Litigation Act and the Capital Post-Conviction Counsel\nI Act in 2000, the State created statewide, state-funded offices to provide legal representation\n-I\nI\n\nI\n!\nfor indigent defendants at all stages of the litigation in capital cases.\nI\nIn a non-capital case, the responsibility for providing indigent defense lies with the\nindividual county in which the prosecution is commenced. Each county has the authority to\nI\nenter into contracts with attomeys to represent indigent defendants on a part-time basis, to\nI\ncreate a public defenders' office within the county, or to establish a public defenders' office in\nconjunction with other counties. See Miss. Code Ann. §§ 25-32-1, et seq. The testimony at\nI\ntrial indicated that three Mississippi counties--notably Hinds County, Jackson County, and\nI\nWashington County--have created full-time public defenders' offices. Rec. 315 [Op. ¶15].\nI Eighteen counties authorize trial courts to appoint lawyers on a case-by-case basis, while the\nremaining sixty-one counties, including Quitman County, employ a contract system. Rec. 315\nI\n[Op. ¶16]. After establishing an indigent-defense system that best suits its needs, each county\nI\nmust then allocate sufficient funds to operate the program. See Miss. Code Ann. § 99-15-17\n(\"The fees and expenses shall be paid by the county treasurer out of the general fund of the\ni\ncounty in which the prosecution was commenced.\"); Miss. Code Ann. § 25-32-7 (providing\n!\nthat counties are responsible for paying the salaries and expenses of a public defender office,\nif it elects to establish one). Even though the State does not directly pay for indigent defense\nI\nin non-capital cases, the Mississippi Constitution explicitly links the counties' duty to pay for\nI\ngeneral court expenses with its right to retain all fines and forfeitures recovered by the State.\nI See Miss. Const. art 14, § 261 (\"The expenses of criminal prosecuti'ons shall be borne by the\ncounty in which such prosecutions shall be begun; and all fines and forfeitures shall be paid\nI\ninto the treasury of such county.\"); Rec. 324 [Op. ¶55]. Moreover, the State provides direct\nI payments to counties, with the result that a large part of each county's annual revenue--over\nI\n!\n\nI\nI\ntwenty-five percent in the case of Quitman County--comes from the State itself. DX 23, p. 7.\nI\nThis dual-track system of providing legal representation for indigent defendants is the\nresult of incremental, legislative reform over the last several years. The court heard testimony\nI\nfrom the Quitman County Chancery Clerk Thomas \"Butch\" Scipper) about the hearings that\nI\nbegan during the Legislature's regular session in 1994. Tr. 106-09. Mr. Scipper and other\ncounty officials apprised legislators of the unpredictable and sizable expense associated with\nI\nindigent defense in capital .cases. Rec. 312 [Op. ¶6]. Quitman County, for example, spent\nI\nmore than $70,000 for legal representation for two indigent criminal defendants charged with\nI capital murder in the early 1990s. Rec. 315 [Op. ¶15]. The Legislature responded to the\ncounties' plea by creating a commission to \"assess the feasibility and cost of implementation\"\nI\nof a statewide, state-funded public defenders' office. Rec. 316 [Op. ¶18]. The Mississippi\nI Public Defender Commission did not try to determine whether the existing system was\nconstitutionally adequate, nor did it consider limited reforms. Tr. 198-99. The Commission\nI\ninstead was charged only with showing the Legislature whether a statewide system could work\nI\nand how much it would cost. ld. The Commission submitted an \"implementation plan\" on\nDecember 31, 1998, and recommended that a statewide system be implemented over a five-\nI\nyear period. Rec. 316 [Op. ¶18]; PX 1. Less than a month after the Commission submitted its\nI\nplan, this Court held that indigent death-row inmates are entitled to appointed counsel in state\nI post-conviction proceedings, not just on direct appeal. Jackson v. State, 732 So.2d 187, 191\n(Miss. 1999); Rec. 316 [Op. ¶19]. The Jackson decision changed the terms of the indigent-\nI\ndefense debate by raising new issues not addressed bY the Commission's implementation plan\ni and by imposing new costs on county governments. The Court \"strongly urged\" the\nI\ni\n\nI\nI\nLegislature to address the problem of indigent defense for death-penalty appeals and state\nI\npost-conviction proceedings, ld.\nThe Legislature acted decisively during its 2000 regular session to reform the State's\nI\nindigent defense system. Specifically, the Legislature repealed the 1998 Act that had created\nI\nthe Public Defender Commission, established the two offices described above--the Office of\nI Capital Defense Counsel and the Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel--and created a\nnew Mississippi Public Defender System Task Force to recommend further reforms in light of\nI\nthe changed situation. See Miss. Code Ann. §§ 99-39-101,99-18-1, and 25-32-71; Rec. 316\nI [Op. ¶20]; Tr. 211. Mr. Scipper, who served on both the Public Defender Commission and\nTask Force, testified that the creation of the new offices in July 2000 removed the substantial\nI\nand unpredictable cost of indigent defense in capital cases, thus making it easier for counties\nI\nto-stay within their budgets. Tr. 213. As will be discussed in detail below, the Legislature's\nreforms in 2000 addressed many of the specific financial concerns in the County's complaint,\nI\nwhich had been filed in December 1999. Rec. 8-10.\nI\nAgainst this backdrop of important legislative reforms, the new Public Defender Task\nForce submitted its findings to the Legislature in September 2000. Rec. 317 [Op. ¶23]; PX 2.\nI\nSignificantly, after conducting its research and seeking the advice of the senior circuit judges\nI\nin each district, the Task Force did not urge the Legislature to adopt a statewide, state-funded\nI indigent defense system. The Task Force instead reasoned that\neach county and district is unique, and what works for one district may not be\nI appropriate for others. In this matter, the Task Force realizes that many\ndistricts may wish to employ a full-time local office, whereas other districts\nmay have a system whereby contract/appointive counsel performs adequately\nI and, as is done in certain other states, local control is maintained with the state\nI\nI\n\nI\n1\nassuming the financial costs. The Task Force did not recommend the state-\nfunding of district, trial-level representation for the 2001 Legislative Session,\nI\nas this would, be too much too soon, considering all of the factors.\nPX 2, p. 6. The Task Force instead proposed several specific reforms to improve the existing\nI\nsystem, such as creating a new office to handle felony appeals and increasing funding through\nI\na small assessment on criminal fines. Rec. 317 [Op. ¶23]; PX 2, pp. 3-6. Finally, the general\nthrust of the Task Force report is that our current indigent defense system definitely has room\nI\nfor improvement, but there is no finding that indigent defendants are receiving constitutionally\ni\ninadequate assistance of counsel on a systematic or widespread basis.\ni To recapitulate: Mississippi's current system for providing indigent criminal defense is\nbased upon the distinction between capital cases and non-capital cases. Rec. 315 [Op. ¶17].\nI\nStatewide, state-funded offices handle capital cases at every stage of the litigation, while the\nI\nindividual county governments are responsible for non-capital cases. Id. The county-based\nsystem allows each county to choose the organizational structure that best suits its needs, and\n!\nit relies upon county boards of supervisors for proper funding and oversight, ld. Mississippi's\nI\ncounty-based system is neither unusual when compared to those in other states nor inherently\nflawed: Even though the Mississippi Constitution and the United States Constitution confer a\nI\nright to effective assistance of counsel, both are silent with respect to how a State fulfills its\nI\nobligation.\nI The central allegation in this case was that the statutes creating Mississippi's system of\nindigent defense violate Art. 3, § 26 of the state constitution \"because they r_sult, in Quitman\nI\nCounty, in widespread ineffective assistance of counsel due to the':f_ct that the County cannot\n' I\ni\nI afford to discharge its burden of providing funding for indigent defdndants in a constitutional\nI\ni\n\nI\nI\nmanner.\" Quitman County 1, 807 So.2d at 407-08. Accordingly, the trial testimony focused\nI\non the financial condition of the County and on whether widespread ineffective assistance of\ncounsel is present in Quitman County.\nI\nOver the last few years, Quitman County has spent $38,361 per year to represent an\nI\naverage of thirty-four indigent defendants per year. Rec. 330 [Op. ¶ 70]; DX 23. In 2001, the\nCounty's expenditures for indigent defense represented less than one percent of its budget of\nI\n$4.7 million, ld. The County did not earmark any of the $136,241 in fines and forfeitures it\nI\nreceived from the State in 2001 for the purpose of funding its indigent defense program. DX\nI 23, p. 7. The County's witnesses testified that the County's financial condition was poor and\nthat it could not afford to spend any more than it already does on indigent defense. Rec. 312-\nI\n13 [Op. ¶7]. But despite its economic problems, the Count3, found room in its 2001 budget\nI for more than $100,000 in discretionary spending. DX I1, 12, 16, 23.\nOn this question of Quitman County's financial condition, the Circuit Court also found\nI\nno evidence to support the allegation that the county-based system has caused \"serious harm\nI\nto Quitman County and its taxpayers.\" Rec. 16, 330 [Comp. ¶25; Op. ¶70]. On the contrary,\nthe evidence suggested that the County's financial condition was attributable to overspending\nI\non solid waste collection, businesses' defaulting on economic-development bonds, and other\nI\nfactors. Rec. 313,330 [Op. ¶¶8, 70]. The court found that Quitman County's duty to pay for\nI indigent defense had not forced it to \"substantially reduce[]\" its spending on other government\n,\nservices like roads, medical care, education, and law enforcement.i Rec. 15,330 [Comp. ¶22;\ni\nI\nOp. ¶70]. iZinally, the Circuit Court found that the cost of providing indigent defense is not\nI \"enormous,\" as the County had alleged: \"With the creation of the Office of Post Conviction\n10\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nCounsel and the Office of Capital Defense Counsel in 2000, the burden of funding indigent\nI\ndefense in capital cases has been taken from the counties. According to testimony, the\ndefense of capital cases was the major source of the 'enormous and unpredictable indigent\nI\ndefense costs' alleged in the Complaint.\" Rec. 330 [Op. ¶71]; see also Rec. 15 [Comp. ¶22];\nI\nRec. 335 [Op. ¶82]; Yr. 205-13. In fact, the creation of the Office of Capital Post-Conviction\nI Counsel in 2000 saved the County, by its own estimate, \"hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"\nRec. 9-10 [Comp. ¶4].\nI\nEven at the present level of funding, Quitman County is able to retain two experienced\nI attorneys--Allan Shackelford and David Yisdell--to represent indigent defendants in circuit\ncourt and justice court. Rec. 313,321 [Op. ¶¶9, 43]. Mr. Shackelford has practiced law since\nI\n1966 and has represented indigent defendants in Quitman County since 1990. Rec. 314 [Op.\nI\n¶11]. He maintains a private law practice in Clarksdale, buthe spends about seventy percent\nof his time working for indigent defendants in Quitman, Coahoma, and Tunica Counties. Id.\nI\nMr. Tisdell has practiced law since 1996 and sera, ed as an assistant district attorney for a year\nI\nand a half before going into private practice. Rec. 313 [Op. ¶10]. About three-fourths of his\npractice is devoted to representing indigent defendants in Quitman, Coahoma, and Tunica\nI\nCounties. Id. He has served as a public defender in Quitman County since 2000, when he\nI\nwas appointed to replace Mr. Thomas Pearson, who had occupied that position for ten years.\nI Rec. 313-14 [Op. ¶¶10-12].\nQuitman County's two public defenders represented an average of seventeen indigent\nI I\ndefendants apiece in Circuit Court each year from 1999 through 2002.: Rec. 314 [Op. ¶l 3]. In\nI exchange for their services, each attorney has been paid a monthly fee of $1350 plus benefits\n11\ni\ni\n\n!\ni\nas a county employee. Rec. 313 [Op. ¶9].\ni\nQuitman County had the burden of proving at trial that the representation provided by\nthese attorneys is generally ineffective as a result of the State's county-based funding system.\nI\nRec. 328 lOp. ¶67]. The County alleged in its complaint that requiring the counties to pay for\nI\nindigent defense services in non-capital cases \"has resulted in constitutional requirements for\neffective assistance of counsel often not being met\" and, more ominously, that the \"numerous\nI\npost-conviction challenges to the adequacy of counsel provided to indigent defendants tried\nI\nfor felonies in Quitman County\" was undermining confidence in the criminal justice system.\nI Rec. 16 [Comp. ¶22]; see also Quitman County I, 807 So.2d at 407-08; Rec. 328 [Op. ¶67].\nAt trial, however,\nI\nthe County presented no evidence to the Court of any post-conviction\nproceedings which challenged the effectiveness of appointed counsel. The\nI\nCounty did not present proof from any defendant who claimed to have received\nineffective assistance, nor did they identify any single case where ineffective\nassistance was alleged. No proof was presented that any case has ever been\nI\noverturned in Quitman County because of ineffective assistance.\nRec. 330-31 [Op. at ¶72]. In other words, the County tried to prove that there was widespread\nI\nor rampant ineffective assistance of counsel in Quitman County without presenting specific\nI\nevidence of inadequate representation in any individual case.\nThe County instead chose to rely on the testimony of three experts--two of whom had\ni\nnever personally observed the Quitman County Circuit Court or the public defenders in action,\nI\nand the third had seen one arraignment day in 2003 when no pleas were taken. Rec. 318 [Op.\nI ¶26]. The experts testified in general terms about the various \"tools\" of an effective criminal\ndefense, including client communication, investigation, motion practice, plea and sentencing\nI\nI 12\n\nI\nI\nnegotiations, expert consultation, trial practice, and appellate advocacy. Rec. 318 [Op. ¶25].\nI\nThese expert witnesses who testified at trial were Thomas Former, who has served since 1991\nas the full-time public defender for Hinds County; Steven Farese, a criminal defense attorney\nI\nwho testified as to the generally recognized standards of the profession; and Stephen Bright,\nI\nthe director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta. Rec. 318 [Op. ¶24]. The\nI Circuit Court also heard testimony from the people who are directly involved in the Quitman\nCounty indigent-defense system--the three attorneys who have served as public defenders, the\nI\nthree sitting Circuit Judges who preside over the Quitman County Circuit Court (Hon. Albert\nI B. Smith, III, Hon. Kenneth L. Thomas, and Hon. Larry O. Lewis), and the District Attorney\nfor the Eleventh Judicial District (Hon. Laurence Y. Mellen); Rec. 321 [Op. ¶¶44-45]. And\nI\non vimaally every point, the Circuit Court found the testimony of the actual participants more\nI\npersuasive than the opinions of the County's experts.\nFirst, the Circuit Court found that the caseloads of Quitman County's public defenders\nI\nare not excessive. Rec. 331 lOp. ¶73]. Each public defender is required to appear in Quitman\nI\nCount3, Justice Court one day each month and represents an average of seventeen defendants\nin Quitman County Circuit Court each year. See id.; Rec. 313-14 [Op. ¶¶9, 13]. Taking into\nI\naccount their private law practices and their indigent cases from the other two counties, each\nI\npublic defender handles no more than 165 cases per year. Id. The court considered the public\nI defenders' testimony that they do \"not feel overburdened W!th their caseload\" more credible\nthat the experts' recommendations that they not take on more thanl150 cases per year. ld.;\nI\nRec. 320 [Op. ¶36]. Moreover, the judges in Quitman County monitor the public defenders'\ni\nI caseloads to ensure that they are manageable. Rec. 322 [op. ¶48].\nI 13\nI\n\nI\nI\nSecond, the Circuit Court found that the Quitman County public defenders were not\nI\nshirking their duties to indigent defendants in order to devote more time and resources to their\nprivate clients. Rec. 334-35 [Op. 181]. The court found the attorneys' and judges' testimony\nI\nmore credible than the expert witness's assertions that \"[p]rivate practice take precedence over\nI\npart time public defender practice. It just does.\" Tr. 346; cf Tr. 512 (Mr. Shackelford stated\nI that he and Mr. Tisdell \"will not allow, and our judges insist that we not.., allow our private\npractice to interfere with our public defender work\"). Rec. 320 [Op. 139]; Rec. 322 lop. 148];\nI\nRec. 331 lop. 173].\nI Third, the Circuit Court found that Mr. Tisdell and Mr. Shackelford each earned $8150\nper month representing indigent defendants in Coahoma, Tunica, and Quitman Counties. Rec.\nI\n313-14 [Op. 11 10-11]. These salaries meet or exceed those paid to part-time public defenders\nI\nin federal courts, to public defenders in Mississippi and in other states, and to attorneys in the\ndistrict attorneys' offices in Mississippi. See Rec. 320 [Op. ¶41]; Rec. 253.\nI\nFourth, the Circuit Court found that Quitman County's two part-time public defenders\nI\nhave sufficient resources to represent indigent defendants. Rec. 322 [Op. 146]. Even though\nQuitman County does not provide office space, both public defenders testified that they meet\nI\nwith their clients in the courthouse or in meeting-rooms at jail. Rec. 318 [Op. ¶28]. And even\nI\nthough the County does not provide extra funds for expenses or staff, the public defenders use\nI their regular offices and employees when appropriate. Rec. 313,322-[Op. 11 9, 46].\nFifth, the Circuit Court found that Quitman County public defenders have an adequate\nI\nopportunity to investigate their clients' cases, even though the County does not contract with\nI investigators who would be available to assist in every case. Rec. 319 lOp. 129]. Instead, the\nI 14\nI\n\nI\nI\npublic defenders generally prefer to conduct their own investigations. Rec. 322 [Op. ¶46]. If\nI\na public defender decides that an independent investigation is warranted, he must petition the\nCircuit Court for the necessary funds and demonstrate a \"substantial need\" for an investigator.\nI\nRec. 327, 334 [Op. ¶¶ 64, 80]. If the Circuit Court grants the petition for an investigator, the\nI\nCounty must provide the funds. Rec. 319 [Op. ¶29]. The court did not accept the County's\nI experts' opinion that it is impossible to have a constitutionally adequate system of indigent\ndefense without a stable of investigators who are available to assist in every case. ld.\nI\nSixth, the Circuit Court found that neither the number of guilty pleas nor the manner in\nI which they are entered indicates that the Quitman County public defenders are systematically\nproviding their clients with ineffective assistance of counsel. Rec. 333 [Op. ¶78]. Most of the\nI\npublic defenders' cases are resolved through guilty pleas, and fewer than ten percent of their\nI\ncases from 1995 to 2003 went to trial. Rec. 319 lop. ¶33]. The evidence also indicated that\nnearly half of the pleas during that period were entered on the same day as arraignment. Rec.\nI\n319 [Op. ¶ 31]. The court did not infer, however, that the practice of entering a guilty plea on\nI\nthe day of arraignment indicates a lack of communication with the client or a lack of adequate\ninvestigation. Rec. 333 [Op. ¶77]. The court pointed out that the frequency of guilty pleas in\nI\nQuitman County Circuit Court is identical to that in other state and federal courts. Rec. 333\nI\n[Op. ¶78]; DX 25; PX 5. Further, the procedures for taking guilty pleas are designed to ensure\nI that each plea is made intelligently and after sufficient consultation with attorneys. Rec. 333\n[Op. ¶78].\nI\nSeventh, the Circuit Court found that the County's public defenders filed substantial\n! ,\nI motions (including, for example, a motion to suppress but not basic discoveryrequests) in\nI 15\nI\n\nI\nI\nseventeen percent of their cases between 1998 and 2000. Rec. 319 [Op. ¶30]; PX 4; Rec. 258.\nI\nThe court drew no inferences from the mere number of motions filed and accepted the judges'\ntestimony that the frequency and type of motions filed was appropriate. Rec. 333 [Op. ¶79].\nI\nThe County did not identify a case in which a substantial motion was warranted but not filed.\nI\nEighth, the Circuit Court found that the public defenders may file petitions for mental\nI examinations or other expert services. Rec. 319 [Op. ¶32]. As was true with the procurement\nof independent investigators, the public defenders must use professional judgment on a case-\nI\nby-case basis to determine whether an expert is necessary. Id. The evidence indicated that\nI public defenders file motions for psychiatric examinations, which are handled by the State\nmental hospital, but that they have requested the services of an expert only once in their non-\nI\ncapital cases, ld. Again, the County did not identify a case in which such a motion was\nI\nwarranted but not filed.\nNinth, the Circuit Court found that Quitman County's indigent defendants were found\nI\nguilty in about eighty percent of the cases that went to trial, and half of those convictions were\nI\nappealed. Rec. 319 [Op. ¶34]. The conviction rate in Quitman County cases (like the rate of\nguilty pleas) is comparable to that in other state and federal courts; accordingly, the court drew\nI\nno inferences from that evidence. DX 25; PX 5. This comparative testimony was especially\nI\nrelevant since federal courts also use part-time public defenders. DX 25.\nI Tenth, the Circuit Court acknowledged the expert witnesses' opinion that the public\ndefenders in Quitman County are not sufficiently independent of the Circuit judges, especially\nI\nsince the senior circuit judge is involved in the hiring decisions. Rec. '320 lOp. ¶¶37-38]. The\nI court did not find, however, that the alleged \"lack of independence\" had resulted in ineffective\nI 16\nI\n\nI\nI\nassistance of counsel.\nI\nEleventh, the Circuit Court found that pretrial delays in processing cases and the short\ntime periods in which to prepare for trial could not be attributed to the county-based indigent\nI\ndefense system; while those problems clearly exist, they also affect non-indigent defendants in\nI\nQuitman County. Rec. 319, 331-32 [Op. ¶¶33, 74]. The court was concerned that indigent\nI defendants were not represented during the time when their cases were on appeal from justice\ncourt to circuit court. Rec. 332 lOp. ¶74]. But once again, the court did not find that flaw to\nI\nbe attributable to the county-based system itself.\nI The Circuit Court thus considered all the County's evidence on the \"essential tools of\na criminal defense\" and the alleged shortcomings of the Quitman County system. Rec. 318,\nI\n332 [Op. ¶¶24-25, 75]. In light of the evidence described above, the Circuit Court concluded\nI\nthat the County's evidence \"falls short of demonstrating that indigent defendants in Quitman\nCounty are receiving ineffective assistance of counsel\" as a result of the County's use of part-\nI\ntime, flat-fee public defenders. Rec. 335 [Op. ¶83].\nI\nThe Circuit Court had stated that the first issue to be decided was \"[w]hether the State\nhas breached its constitutional duty to provide indigent defendants with effective assistance of\nI\ncounsel by requiring Quitman County to fund indigent criminal defense in that County.\" Rec.\nI\n311 lOp. ¶4]. Because Quitman County did not carry the burden of proving that the county-\nI based system has led to chronic underfunding and systemic ineffective assistance of counsel,\nthe Circuit Court had no authority to enjoin the Legislature to create a statewide, state-funded\nI\nsystem of indigent defense. Rec. 336 lOp. ¶83]. But Judge Lamar did take the opportunity to\nI encourage the Legislature to continue to address the issue of indigent: defense in Mississippi.\nI 17\nI\n\ni\nI\nI\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nI\nTwo issues were presented to the Circuit Court. First, is Mississippi's county-based\nindigent defense system, which requires counties to provide the funding in non-capital cases,\nI\nthe cause of chronic underfunding and systemic ineffective assistance of counsel in Quitman\nI\nCounty? Second, if the State is systematically failing in its duty to provide effective counsel,\nare the defects so extreme that the courts must intervene and order the Legislature to establish\nI\na statewide, state-funded system of indigent criminal defense? Those issues were articulated\nI\nin this Court's first Quitman County opinion and also in the Circuit Court's opinion. Quitman\nI County I, 807 So.2d at 408,410; l_ec. 311 [Op. ¶4].\nOn the first issue, Quitman County did not meet its burden of proving that the present\nI\nindigent defense system is unconstitutional because the County (a) did not prove that its part-\nI\ntime public defenders are providing constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel on a\nsystematic or regular basis, and (b) did not prove that the deficiencies in the County's indigent\nI\ndefense system are attributable to the current funding system.\nI\nQuitman County sought to prove its case by using expert witnesses who testified about\nthe \"tools of a criminal defense\" and presented the court with raw data concerning conviction\nI\nrates, the frequency of guilty pleas, the public defenders' caseload, and access to experts and\nI\nprofessional investigators. The Circuit Court did not accept the expert witnesses' sweeping\nI generalizations uncritically. Many of the experts' assertions were undermined or contradicted\nby the testimony of the two current public defenders, a former public defender, three Circuit\nI I\nCourt judges, and the district attorney--all of whom were in a position to observe whether the\nI experts' categorical statements had any real-world validity. Moreover, the statistics that the\nI 18\n!\n\n,I\nI\nCounty's experts relied upon could not bear that was placed upon them. For example, the\nI\ncourt did not infer that the frequency of guilty pleas in Quitman County is a sign of ineffective\nassistance of counsel because a virtually identical percentage of indigent defendants in federal\nI\ncourts and other state courts plead guilty. The Circuit Court did not clearly err when it found\nI\nthat Quitman County's current indigent defense system satisfies the constitutional obligation\nI to provide adequate legal representation.\nThe evidence also showed that Quitman County is able to provide the necessary funds\nI\nto support a constitutionally adequate indigent defense system. The Circuit Court found that\nI the County spent less than one percent of its entire budget in 2001 on indigent defense; that\nthe Legislature's decision in 2000 to assume the costs for capital litigation further decreased\nI\nthe burden on the counties; that the County's duty to pay for non-capital indigent defense is\nI\nnot the cause of the C6unty's financial difficulties; and, finally, that the County could allocate\nadditional resources to indigent defense, if its board of supervisors really believed that it was\nI\nnecessary. Thus, even if the County had proven widespread ineffective assistance of counsel,\nI\nthey still would not have established the necessary link between the ineffectiveness and the\ncounty-based funding mechanism.\nI\nWithout proof that the State had violated Art. 3, § 26 by requiring the counties to pay\ni\nfor indigent defense in non-capital cases, the Circuit Court had no authority to enjoin the\nI Legislature to establish a statewide, state-funded system. The responsibility for expending\npublic funds on indigent criminal defense is traditionally a legislative question, and the courts\nI\nmay intervene only in cases of absolute necessity. This is not such a lease.\nI Quitman County has presented five issues for appellate review, none of which has\ni 19\nI\n\n!\ni\nmerit. First, the Circuit Court did not require the County to prove that individual defendants\nI\nhad suffered actual prejudice from the public defenders' performance as counsel. The court\ndid find it probative, however, that the County presented no evidence of specific instances\nI\nwhen the public defenders' performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness--\ni\neven though the County had alleged in its complaint that there have been \"numerous\" post-\nI conviction challenges involving Quitman County's public defenders.\nSecond, the Circuit Court did not apply an incorrect legal standard or commit clear\nI\nerror when it made the findings mentioned above regarding Quitman County's financial\ni condition.\nThird, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion with respect to certain evidentiary\nI\nrulings. The court liberally allowed the County's experts to offer their opinions as long as the\nI\ngrounds of the opinion were clear. Yet the County now complains that one of its experts was\nnot allowed to offer his opinion on whether we should \"fear[] for the integrity of the court\nI\nsystem.\" Such a vague and irrelevant opinion could not have been helpful to the court, and it\nI\nwas properly excluded. Nor did the court abuse its discretion in allowing three sitting judges\nto testify about their personal observations on how the indigent defense system operates in\nI\nQuitman County.\nI\nFinally, the Circuit Court's decision is amply supported by the evidence presented at\nI trial and is not the result of improper bias or other factors.\nI\nI\nI 20\nI\n\n1\n!\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nI\nWhen reviewing a judgment from a bench trial, this Court will not disturb findings of\nfact unless they are manifestly wrong: \"'A circuit judge sitting without ajury is accorded the\nI\nsame deference with regard to his findings as a chancellor,' and his findings are safe on appeal\nI\nwhere they are supported by substantial, credible, and reasonable evidence.\" City of Clinton\nI v. Smith, 861 So.2d 323,326 (Miss. 2003) (internal citations omitted). Conclusions of law are\nreviewed de novo. Par lndus., lnc. v. Target Container Co., 708 So.2d 44, 47 (Miss. 1998).\nI\nA court's evidentiary rulings are reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. Whitten v.\ni Cox, 799 So.2d 1, 13 (Miss. 2000). \"The admission of expert testimony is addressed to the\nsound discretion of the trial judge. Unless we conclude that the discretion was arbitrary and\nI\nclearly erroneous, amounting to an abuse of discretion, that decision will stand.\" Seal v.\nI\nMiller, 605 So.2d 240, 243 (Miss. 1992); see also Terrain Enter., lnc. v. Mockbee, 654 So.2d\n1122, 1131 (Miss. 1995) (evidentiary rulings are subject to harmless error analysis).\nI\nThe substantive legal standards are equally clear: Quitman County is challenging the\nI\nconstitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. § 99-15-17 and the other statutes that establish a system\nof indigent defense in non-capital cases that is funded by the counties and organized as each\nI\ncounty chooses. The County had to establish the unconstitutionality of this system beyond a\nI\nreasonable doubt. Jones v. State, 710 So.2d 870, 877 (Miss. 1998). Statutes are presumed to\nI be constitutional, and the conflict between a statutory scheme and a constitutional provision\nmust be \"palpable\" before the courts of this State will declare a statute unconstitutional. State\nI\nv. Mississippi Ass'n of Supervisors, lnc., 699 So.2d 1221, 1223 (Miss. 1997).\ni\nI 21\n!\n\n!\n!\nARGUMENT\nI\nI. The Circuit Court applied the correct legal standard for determining whether the\nindigent defense system in Quitman County has produced widespread ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\nI\nThe Circuit Court unambiguously stated that the question before it was not \"whether in\nI\nisolated cases the public defenders were ineffective.\" Rec. 336 [Op. ¶84]. Nevertheless, the\n1 Count3, now contends that the court \"proceeded as if this were an individual post-conviction\nproceeding and Quitman had to prove on a case-by-case basis that the attorney's performance\nwas deficient and the defendant was prejudiced .... \" Brief for Appellant at 26.\ni\ni To be sure, the Circuit Court was expecting to hear testimony about individual cases\nand examples of ineffective assistance of counsel. Common sense suggests that if Quitman\nil\nCounty claims there is widespread and pervasive ineffectiveness, the most probative evidence\nI\nto support that claim would be testimony about specific instances when the public defenders'\nperformance fell below \"an objective standard of reasonableness\" as measured by professional\ni\nnorms. Stricklandv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674\ni\n(1984) (defining a constitutionally \"deficient\" performance by counsel); Simon v. State, 857\nSo.2d 668,682-83 (Miss. 2003) (same). The trial court also expected to hear such testimony\nI\nsimply because the County alleged in its complaint that requiring each county to pay for its\ni\nown public defenders had \"resulted in constitutional requirements for effective assistance of\ni counsel often not being met\" and in \"numerous post-conviction challenges to the adequacy of\ncounsel provided to indigent defendants tried for felonies in Quitman County.\" Rec. 16\ni\n[Comp. ¶22]. If the County had such evidence, they chose not to present it at trial. And the\nI Circuit Court was hardly remiss in pointing out the absence of proof:\n,I 22\n!\n\nI\nI\nThe County alleged that \"there have been \"numerous post-conviction\nchallenges to the adequacy of counsel provided to indigent defendants tried for\nI\nfelonies in Quitman County.\" However, the County presented no evidence to\nthe Court of any post-conviction proceedings which challenged the\neffectiveness of appointed counsel. The County did not present proof from any\nI\ndefendant who claimed to have received ineffective assistance, nor did they\nidentify any single case where ineffective assistance was alleged. No proof\nI was presented that any case has even been overturned in Quitman County\nbecause of ineffective assistance.\nI Rec. 330-31 [Op. ¶72]. As this passage suggests, the court took notice of the fact that the\nCounty did not present any evidence on one of the central factual allegations in its complaint.\nI\nQuitman County cites that passage as evidence that the Circuit Court \"fundamentally\nI misconceived\" the nature of its case. Brief for Appellant at 26. Neither the court nor the State\nDefendants thought the County was seeking to overturn particular convictions. Id. Nor does\nI\nany party dispute that an ineffective assistance claim may be raised prospectively; this Court's\nI\ndecision in Quitman Coun.tv I resolved that issue. Even so, the Strickland standard does not\nbecome completely irrelevant in cases for prospective, systematic relief.\nI\nThe County still had to show that the public defenders are performing in a \"deficient\"\nI\nmanner (the first prong of Strickland) and are doing so regularly. See, e.g., State of Lousiana\nv. Peart, 621 So.2d 780, 789 (La. 1993). The Circuit Court did not require Quitman County\nI\nto prove, on a case-by-case basis, that the deficient performance achaally affected the outcome\nI\nof the trial (the second prong of Strickland). The salient point is that the County did not try to\nI show specific examples of when the public defenders' legal representation fell below the\nobjective standard of professional reasonableness. While perhaps not fatal to the County's\nI\nclaim, the absence of specific evidence could not have helped.\nI\nI 23\ni\n\nI\nI\nII. Theevidence of Quitman County's financial condition shows that (a) the County\nhas sufficient resources to fund a constitutionally adequate indigent defense\nI\nsystem and (b) the County's obligation to pay for indigent defense in non-capital\ncases has neither caused the County's present economic troubles nor forced the\nCounty to substantially reduce other governmental services.\n,I\nThe County alleged in its complaint that Mississippi's current indigent defense system\nI\nhas \"imposed enormous and unpredictable\" costs and that the \"financial resources available to\nI fund schools, hospitals, local law enforcement and the traditional health, safety, and welfare\nobligations of county government have been substantially reduced.\" Rec. 15 [Comp. ¶22],\nI\nquoted in Quitman County 1, 807 So.2d at 409. But, as the Quitman County Chancery Clerk\nI admitted, the reason for the unpredictable spikes in budgetary outlays was the expense of\ndefending capital cases--a potentially ruinous cost that is no longer borne by the counties. Tr.\nI\nat 213. (Indeed, the County had alleged in its complaint that it faced \"possible financial ruin\"\ni\nbecause the Court's Jackson decision would require it to pay for post-conviction proceedings\nin capital cases, at a cost of\"hundreds of thousands of dollars.\" Rec. 9-10 [Comp. ¶4].) The\nI\nchanged circumstances did not go unnoticed by the Circuit Court. Rec. 330 [Op. ¶71].\nI\nThe court also found no evidentiary support for Quitman County's allegation that the\ncost of providing indigent defense services had led to decreased funding for other essential\nI\nservices. Rec. 330 [Op. ¶70]. Nor, more generally, was there any evidence that the County's\nI\ncurrent fiscal problems are the result of spending on indigent defense. Instead, the court found\nI that Quitman County's deficit has been caused by spending on \"solid waste, other unfunded\nmandates, natural disasters, and economic development bonds that :were not being repaid.\" ld.\nI\nAs the court remarked, the cost of non-capital indigent defense is nbt the cause of Quitman\n1\nI\nI\nCounty's budget problems, and a wholly state-funded system be the solution to the County's\nI 24\nI\n\nI\nI\ndifficulties.\ni\nQuitman County seems to argue that it put on all the proof it needed when Chancery\nClerk Scipper announced that the County cannot afford to pay any more for indigent defense\nI\nthan it already does. Brief for Appellant at 29. The County neglects to mention the testimony\ni|\nand documentary evidence on the County's discretionary spending and its spending priorities.\nI See, e.g.. DX 11, 12, 16, 23. If the Quitman County Board of Supervisors made indigent\ndefense a higher priority, the County could find the additional funds--even if that meant less\nI\ndiscretionary spending on recreation and similar projects.\nI On a related but distinct point, the County argues that it could not afford to pay for a\nconstitutionally adequate system. They reason as follows: (a) the County's experts opined that\nI\nthe only constitutionally permissible system is a full-time public defender's office; (b) the cost\nof establishing of a full-time office in Quitman County would cost approximately $300,000 to\ni\n$500,000, (c) the County cannot afford to bring its indigent defense system into compliance\nI\nwith constitutional requirements by creating its own public defenders' office; and, therefore,\nI\n(d) the State has to relieve the County of that burden by creating a statewide and state-funded\noffice. Brief for Appellant at 29-30. Of course, the County's expert did not explain why a full\nI\ntime public defenders' office in a county with a population of 10,000 would cost more than\nI\nthe full-time office in a county (Jackson County) with more than 130,000 people. See Rec.\nI 315 [Op. ¶15]; Mississippi Official and Statistical Register, 2000-2004, at 238, 282.\nBut even assuming that the cost estimate is correct, the County's argument ignores a\nI\ncrucial point: The Circuit Court found that Quitman County's systeni of providing indigent\nI ,i\nI ,_ ' •\ni defense services is not providing constitutionally inadequate legal representation, even at the\n! 25\nI\n\nI\nI\ncurrent level offunding. Unless the County was able to show that it was providing inadequate\ni\nservices, the question of its ability to pay thousands of dollars more per year simply does not\ncome into play.\nI\nMoreover, the County cannot plausibly maintain that the Legislature is prohibited from\n,| imposing financial burdens on counties. It.has long been established that each county is an\nI agency or subdivision of the state, created for administration and other public purposes. See\nState of Mississippi v. Hinds CounO, Board of Sup 'rs, 635 So.2d 839, 843 (Miss. 1994). The\ni\nState's \"creator power\" over the counties extends to the control of funds in the possession of\nI counties: \"The revenues of a county are subject to the control of the Legislature, and when the\nLegislature directs their application to a particular purpose or to the payment of the claims of\nI\nparticular parties, the obligation to so pay is thereby imposed on the county.\" Jackson CounO,\ni\nv. Neville, 95 So. 626, 629 (Miss. 1932).\nIn sun, the County's main allegation is that the county-based system is unconstitutional\ni\nbecause it results, \"in Quitman County, in widespread ineffective assistance of counsel due to\ni\nthe fact that the County cannot afford to discharge its burden of providing funding for indigent\ndefendants in a constitutional manner.\" Quitman County I, 807 So.2d at 407-08. The Circuit\ni\nCourt found insufficient evidence that the County's public defenders are providing ineffective\nI\nassistance on a regular basis, and that finding alone is fatal to the :County's claim. The court\nI went further and found that the County could indeed afford to spend more if it chose; that the\ncreation of the statewide offices for capital litigation eliminated the possibility that the County\nI\nII\ncould suffer serious financial setbacks because of indigent defense_ costs; and that spending on\nJ\n. i t\nindigent defense had not led to deficit spending or substantial cuts in other essential services.\ni\nI 26\ni\n\nI\nI\nNothing in the Circuit Court's discussion of Quitman County's financial condition indicates\nI\nthat the trial court disregarded this Court's prior opinion, applied a \"newly devised test,\" or\nconsidered a \"different issue.\" Brief for Appellant at 30. The County's second assignment of\ni\nerror is thus without merit.\nI\nI III. The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion with respect to its evidentiary\nrulings.\nI A. The court allowed Quitman County's expert witnesses to freely offer\nopinion testimony, including opinions on the ultimate issue before the\ncourt, as long as the factual bases and legal criteria were clearly\nI\nestablished and the testimony was not redundant.\nQuitman County relied heavily on the opinion testimony of its three expert witnesses:\nI\nThomas Fortner, Steven Farese, and Stephen Bright. As soon as Mr. Farese was designated as\nI\nan expert on the generally recognized standards of criminal defense practice, the County asked\nfor his opinion on \"whether... Quitman County's public defenders.., are rendering the - an\nI\neffective criminal defense.\" Tr. 619, 624-25. The court sustained the State's objection to that\nI\nquestion and reminded the County's attorney of the agreement the parties had reached one day\nI earlier when Mr. Fortner was testifying. Tr. 625. At that time, the State Defendants objected\nto the general practice of allowing attorneys to offer expert opinions on the legal conclusions\nI\nto be drawn from the evidence. Tr. at 329. The State argued that such opinion testimony was\nI inadmissible, irrelevant, and unhelpful in the sense that allowing attorneys to testify as experts\non the ultimate legal issue \"just invites the other side to go get another practicing attorney to\nI\ntake the stand to have a battle of experts on an issue which is squarely resolvable only by the\ni\nI\nCourt.\" Tr. 329-330; RE tab 21. The County's attorney protested flaat the State's objection\nI 27\n!\n\nI\nI\nwas \"much ado about little\" because, even if the court did not permit expert opinions on the\nI\nultimate issue, the County would \"certainly ask\" its experts for their opinions about subsidiary\nissues like conviction rates, motion practice, plea agreements, and other aspects of criminal\nI\ndefense practice. Tr. 330-31.\nI\nThe court acknowledged that having attorney experts offering opinions on the ultimate\nI legal issue might not be very helpful, but the court ruled that she would\nallow this witness [Mr. Fortner] to testify as an expert in the field offered of\nI indigent defense and I do think that he has specialized knowledge through his\nexperience and training. And as to the ultimate question or the legal\nconclusion which must be drawn, that is a question for the Court and I would\nI\njust as soon you stay away from it. But I \"know there are matters that Mr.\nFortner can assist the Court on and I will allow him to testify and give those\nopinions.\nI\nTr. 333. By asking the parties to \"stay away\" from opinions on the ultimate issue, the court\nI\nindicated that she would allow expert opinion testimony on specific, fact-based matters while\nbeing less receptive to the sweeping and unsupported opinions that the County's attorneys\nI\nrepeatedly elicited. In that respect, the Court was following closely to the Comment to Rule\nI\n704. Although \"ultimate issue\" opinions may be admissible, \"[a] question may not be asked\nwhich is based on inadequately explored legal criteria since the answer would not be helpful.\"\nI\nComment, Miss. R. Evid. 704. The trial court, who was sitting as the trier of fact, was merely\nI\ngiving the parties some guidance about what opinion testimony would be useful in deciding\nI the issues. .\nThis interpretation of the court's ruling is supporte d by an exchange that occurred just\nI\nI :. •\na few minutes later when Mr. Fortner was asked for his expert oplmon \"regarding how the\n1\nI\nsystem is working in Quitman County.\" Tr. 338. When the attorney for the State asked if that\nI 28\nI\n\nI\nI\nwas the kind of legal conclusion that the witness should avoid, the Court allowed the witness\nI\nto answer, ld. Mr Fortner responded that the Quitman County indigent defense system is \"not\na fair system\" and that defendants \"aren't being adequately represented,\" but the court quickly\nI\ninterrupted him and said, \"Well, I would like you to tell me whatyour opinion is based on.\"\nI\nTr. 338 (emphasis added).\nI That single exchange encapsulates the trial court's approach to expert testimony: The\ncourt, sitting as the trier of fact, did not find it helpful to have a parade of experts declaring ex\nI\ncathedra that the system is unconstitutional. Therefore, after Mr. Fortner already had testified\nI about specific aspects of the Quitman County system, the court allowed him to offer his expert\nopinion on the more general question of whether it is \"possible for a part-time public defender\nI\nto do his or her job in an adequate manner.\" Tr. 358. The trial court, in other words, allowed\nI\nopinion testimony as long as there was sufficient background testimony to make the opinion\nhelpful.\nI\nOne day after the court had addressed the proper scope of expert testimony, the County\nI\ncalled Mr. Farese to the stand, and after he was designated as an expert, the very first question\nhe was asked was whether, in his expert opinion, the Quitman County public defendei's were\nI\nproviding constitutionally adequate representation. Tr. 624. The State objected, and the trial\nI\ncourt's understandable response was, \"We did hash this [out] yesterday, right... ?\" ld. The\nI County's attorney decided to \"focus on some of the specific practices with regard to indigent\ndefense,\" and Mr. Farese offered many opinions on indigent defense systems in general and\nI\n.1\non the Quitman County system in particular. (Indeed, his full testimony, takes up almost one\nI hundred pages of the trial transcript.)\nI 29\n|\n\nI\nI\nThe trial court did not allow Mr. Farese to answer the two final questions asked by the\nI\nCounty's attorney. When Mr. Farese was asked during re-direct examination if he supported a\n\"particular type of defense system,\" the court intervened:\nI\nBY THE COURT: I think it's in the record two or three times, what\nI kind of system he would support, is it not?\nBY THE WITNESS: I think the Court is correct.\nBY THE COURT: I would sustain the objection on the basis of\nI accumulative nature. I've heard it.\nTr. 698. The County's attorney said that she had \"one last question,\" and that was whether he\nI\nhad \"any fears for the integrity of the court system.\" Tr. 698-99. The State objected and the\nI court sustained the objection, without further protest or explanation from the County. Tr. 699.\nThe trial court had ruled many times before that such open-ended and sweeping expert\nI\nopinions were not helpful to the court and, as a general rule, would not be admitted for that\nI\nreason. At trial, the County described the court's approach to expert testimony as \"much ado\nabout little.\" Now, the County argues that the exclusion of this \"one last question\" for Mr.\nI\nFarese's opinion on the \"integrity of the court system\" constitutes reversible error. Brief for\nI\nAppellant at 32. Mr. Farese already had addressed his specific concerns about the indigent\nI defense system in his extensive testimony, and allowing one final, sweeping opinion during\nre-direct examination was redundant and unhelpful. (The Court had not allowed some of the\nI\nquestions for Mr. Former on the grounds that they were redundant, see, e.g.. Tr. 356.)\nI The trial court thus took a consistent approach with the expert wttnesses by allowing\nopinion testimony that had a sufficient factual predicate but exc!uding testimony that either\nI\nlacked a basis in fact or was unduly repetitive. These rulings were guided by the principles\nI\nthat expert opinion testimony should not be admitted unless it is helpful to the trier of fact and\nI 30\nI\n\nI\nI\nbased on adequately developed facts and legal criteria. Accordingly, the trial court's decision\nI\nto limit Mr. Farese's opinion testimony was not an abuse of discretion and, moreover, cannot\nconstitute reversible error in light of the extensive opinion testimony he was allowed to give\nI\non specific aspects of the system.\nI\nI B. The court properly allowed sitting Circuit Judges to testify about their\npersonal observations about how the public defender system functions in\nQuitman County and did not allow the judges to offer improper expert\nI opinion testimony.\nQuitman Count), complains that it was whipsawed by the court's evidentiary rulings\nI\nthat prevented them from introducing some expert opinion testimony but allowed the State to\nI call circuit judges to testify about the public defenders who appear in their courtrooms. Brief\nfor Appellant at 36.\nI\nThe court correctly handled the difficult issue of judicial testimony. When rejecting\nI\nthe County's request to exclude the judges' testimony, the court observed that it would have\nbeen unfair to allow the Plaintiffs to challenge the constitutionality of \"this very system over\nI\nwhich these three circuit judges preside\" but not let the judges share their observations on how\nI\nthe system works or respond to the concerns raised by the County. Tr. 411. The court ruled\nI that the judges could testify if they wanted to and that they would not be designated as experts\nand thus could not offer legal opinions on the constitutionality 0fthe system. Tr. 410-13. The\nI\nL .\ncourt added that the judges' testimony would be very useful because it would be \"based on\nI their own personal knowledge about the system and how it works in this county and their own\nT\npersonal observations\" of the part-time public defenders. Yr. 4i2.\nI .i\nI 31\nm.\n\nI\nI\nWhen Circuit Judge Albert B. Smith III was called to the stand, the court reiterated, for\nI\nthe benefit of the witness and the parties, that the judges' testimony should not include legal\nopinions or discussions of specific cases but should be limited to personal observations about\nI\nhow the Quitman County public defender system works. Tr. 717. Judge Smith made general\nI\nobservations about the public defenders' \"winning a lot of their cases\" and the frequency and\nI quality of motions. Tr. 718-19. Judge Smith also testified about the procedures for handling\nguilty pleas--an issue that was the subject of extensive criticism from the County's experts.\nI\nTr. 720-25. None of Judge Smith's testimony could be fairly characterized as improper expert\nI opinion testimony. Indeed, when the State's attorney asked Judge Smith whether he believed\nthat they are \"effective advocates for their clients,\" the court sustained the County's objection.\nI\nTr. 725-26.\nI\nCircuit Judge Larry Lewis was then called to testify about the appointment of public\ndefenders in Quitman County Circuit Court, the judges' standard practices for accepting pleas,\nI\nand the public defenders' handling of motions and trials. Tr. at 895-918. He explained that\nI\nbefore taking a guilty plea, the judges require each defendant to \"certify to the Court that the\ndefendant has informed his lawyer [of] everything that he knows about the charge, the facts of\nI\nthe case.\" Tr. 898. While the judge would not have direct knowledge of the content or scope\nI\nof an attorney's private communication with his client, the plea colloquy is designed to ensure\nI that such communication does occur. Tr. 898-99. The circuit judges also ask each defendant\ndirectly whether he has committed the crime, and, as Judge Lew_s iput it, \"If the defendant\nI\nfalters in any way at that point, the plea is off.\" Tr. 899. The circuit judges also require each\n LII:\nI defendant to certify that he is competent to enter a plea, and Judge_:Lewis emphasized that the\nl 32\n!\n\nI\nI\nCounty's public defenders \"understand their obligation.., to file for a mental examination\" if\nI\nthere is any doubt about the defendant's mental condition. Tr. 902.\nJudge Lewis testified that he had observed Quitman County's public defenders both in\nI\nhis capacity as a county prosecutor and as a circuit judge and that he always found them well-\nI\nprepared. Tr. 913-15. He testified that the public defenders regularly file various motions,\nI including motions to suppress evidence. Tr. 915-17. When asked whether he had observed\nany differences in how the public defenders represented indigent defendants as opposed to\nI\ntheir paying clients, Judge Lewis replied, \"No, sir. None at all.\" Tr. 915. When he was asked\nI whether the public defenders were \"effective advocates,\" Judge Lewis carefully limited his\nanswer to the \"results of their work,\" and testified that they are competent in the sense that\nI\nthey prevail in many of their cases. Tr. 916-17.\nI\nThe judges' testimony should be read in the proper context. Quitman County built its\ncase around abstruse opinion testimony (such as Mr. Fortner's view that economic pressures\nI\non part-time public defenders would invariably result in the neglect of indigent clients) and\nI\nraw statistical data (such as the percentage of indigent cases in Quitman County that proceed\nto trial). Allowing the trier of fact to hear testimony from the people who actually participate\nI\nin the indigent defense system helped assign the proper weight to the County's evidence. For\nI\nexample, the County presented evidence that more than three-fourths of indigent defendants\nI represented by Quitman County public defenders plead guilty and then asked the court to infer\nthat the percentage of guilty pleas is attributable to ineffective assistance of counsel. But that\nI\ninference was not warranted in light of the State's evidence of plea rates in other courts plus\ni\nthe judges' testimony about how pleas are entered in Quitman County Circuit Court.\nI 33\ni\n\nI\nI\nThe County acknowledges that the circuit judges \"have personal knowledge of what\nI.\nthey observe the lawyers doing in their courtroom,\" see Brief for Appellant at 36, which is\nI exactly why they were called as witnesses. The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in\nrelying on the judges' testimony to help it determine whether the public defenders' caseload is\nI\nexcessive, whether indigent defendants are entering into ill-advised plea agreements, and\nI whether the public defenders take seriously the obligation to represent indigent defendants.\nRec. 331,333-34 [Op. ¶¶ 73, 78, 79]. The court did not treat the judges' testimony as expert\nI\nopinion testimony on whether the public defenders were providing constitutionally adequate\nI\nrepresentation.\nI\nIV. Quitman Count)' did not meet its burden of proving that Mississippi's county-\nbased system of providing indigent defense services is unconstitutional.\nI\nQuitman County contends that the Circuit Court's \"decision goes against the weight of\nI\nthe evidence.\" Brief for Appellant at 41. Although the County repeatedly accuses the court of\nignoring some of the evidence, the County's own discussion reveals that the court either found\nI\nthe County's evidence less probative than the evidence submitted by the State Defendants or,\nI\nin some cases, refused to draw the inference that the County wanted.\nI The County cannot re-try its case on appeal. This Court is required to accept as true\nall \"evidence which supports or reasonably tends to support the findings of fact made below,\nI\ntogether with all reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom and which favor the\nI lower court's findings of fact. That there may be other eviderice to the contrary is irrelevant.\"\nPar lndus., 708 So.2d at 47 (internal quotation marks omitted)i A point-by-point examination\nI I ,\nI 34\nI\n\nI\ni\nof the County's argument shows that the County is not taking into account the evidence in the\nI\nrecord that its unfavorai_le to its position. Quitman County points out, for example, that its\npublic defenders have a total caseload of around 165 cases a year even though the American\nI\nBar Association standards recommend handling no more than 150 cases per year. Brief for\nI\nAppellant at 40. Because first-hand testimony about the public defenders' caseload indicated\nI that they were not overwhelmed by their work, the court surely was not required to find that\nhandling 165 cases instead of 150 cases had either resulted in or contributed to widespread\nI\nineffective assistance of counsel.\nI Similarly, Quitman County does not take into account the judges' testimony, which\ngenerally conflicts with the County's evidence. Nor does Quitman County address the public\nI\ndefenders' testimony about how they generally conduct investigations themselves and decide\nI\non a case-by-case basis whether to use the services of a professional investigator or retain an\nexpert witness, see, e.g., Tr. 449, 461,517-18,522-23; use their own offices, secretarial staff,\nI\ncomputers, and other resources, see, e.g., Tr. 449-50; conduct discovery, see. e.g.. Tr. 856-57;\nI\nand communicate with clients, see, e.g.. Tr. 458-59, 514-17, 562-64, 854-56. The testimony\nI of the judges and public defenders was the only first-hand account of how the system actually\noperates, and it should not be surprising that the court considered that testimony helpful in\nI\ndetermining whether there has been widespread ineffective assistance of counsel in Quitman\nI County as a result of the county-based indigent defense system. Finally, the County does not\naddress the State's documentary evidence, which has been discussed elsewhere in this brief\nI\nand need not be summarized here.\nI\nQuitman County also refers to its sparse evidence of deficiencies throughout the State.\nI 35\nI\n\nI\nI\nBrief for Appellant at 38. Perhaps evidence of statewide failures in indigent defense could\nI\nhave been useful for fashioning the proper remedy. But the court found insufficient evidence\nof chronic ineffectiveness in Quitman County and thus did not reach the difficult remedial\nI\nquestion of whether to order the county to improve its indigent defense system or whether to\nI\norder the Legislature to create a new statewide, state-funded system. Even if the County had\nI prevailed on the first issue addressed by the Circuit Court, the County still would not have\nbeen entitled to the relief it requested. See Peart, 621 So.2d at 784, 791 (refusing to order a\nI\nstatewide system where the local public defender had a truly staggering caseload of nearly 420\nI cases in an eight-month period); see also Wilson v. State, 547 So.2d 1338, 1340-41 (Miss.\n1990) (finding insufficient grounds for enjoining the Legislature to expend public funds on\nI\nindigent criminal defense). For these reasons, the Circuit Court's decision is amply supported\nI\nby the evidence presented at trial.\nI\nV° The Circuit Court's observation that Mississippi's system of providing indigent\ndefense should be improved by the Legislature---even though there was no proof\nI\nin this case of a constitutional violation that would warrant judicial\nintervention--is not a showing of improper bias or opinion.\nI\nQuitman County's final argument focuses on the closing paragraphs of the Circuit\nI Court's opinion. The Countycharges that Circuit Judge Ann H. Lamar violated Canon 3A of\nthe Code of Judicial Conduct and \"injected an unfortunate note of personal opinion into a\nI\ndecision of statewide significance and constitutional import, and contrary to the expressed\nI view of the majority of the Quitman Court.\" Brief for Appellant at 42-43. Here, quoted in\ni\nfull, are the passages that the County finds objectionable:\nI\nI 36\n\nI\nI\nThe County bears the burden of proving that the rights of indigent\ndefendants are being violated in Quitman County and across the state to the\nI\nextent that this court should hold the funding scheme established by our\nlegislature as unconstitutional. While this lawsuit has raised issues of\nstatewide concern which give rise to serious constitutional dilemmas, the Court\nI\nconcludes that the County falls short of demonstrating that indigent defendants\nin Quitman County are receiving ineffective assistance of counsel ....\nI\nThe question before this Court is not whether the county-based system\nis the best system of indigent defense. The question is not even whether in\nI isolated cases the public defenders were ineffective. Rather, the question is\nwhether Mississippi's county-based system is a constitutionally adequate\nsystem of indigent defense. This Court finds that our system meets\nI constitutional demands. This is not to say that another approach would not be\nmore desirable. This Court agrees with the sentiments expressed by three\njustices in the dissenting opinion in State v. Quitman County, 807 So.2d at 413\nI (Pittman, C.J., dissenting):\nI agree that it would be wise of the Legislature to create and\nI\nfund a statewide public defenders' office. However, the\nLegislature has attempted to solve the problem of indigent\ndefense in other ways. By its actions the Legislature has shown\nI\nthat it is not blind to the plight of Quitman County. It is the\nLegislature which holds the key to solving these problems, not\nthis Court by impressive and excessive exercise of judicial\nI\nauthority.\nI\nRec. 335-36 [Op. ¶¶83-84].\nCircuit Judge Lamar's ability to distinguish betaveen her own personal views about the\nI\ndesirability of a statewide public defenders' office and her judicial authority to grant that relief\nI-\ngiven the facts of this case is commendable; it is not grounds for reversal. Our judiciary does\nI have the extraordinary power to order the Legislature to expend public funds, but only \"in\ncases of absolute necessity.\" State v. Hosford, 525 S0:2d 789,:798 (Miss. 1988) (holding that\nI\nd\na court may compel a county board of supervisors to ,cgmply with its statutory duty to provide\nI adequate courtroom facilities)..But in this case, Quitman JCounty did not meet its burden of\nI 37\nI\n\nI\nI\nproving that the county-based system has resulted in widespread ineffective assistance of\nI\ncounsel and could not carry the further burden of showing that their requested injunction was\nthe proper remedy. Until such a showing is made at trial, the decision whether to implement a\nI\nstatewide, state-funded public defender office is a question for the Legislature.\nI\nCONCLUSION\nI\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Defendants-Appellees--the State of Mississippi,\nI\nGovernor Haley Barbour, and Attorney General Jim Hood--request that the judgment of the\nCircuit Court be affirmed.\nI\nRespectfully submitted, this the 15Ihday of November, 2004.\nI\nI BY: Jim Hood,\nAttorney General of the State of Mississippi\nI\nI\nHarold E.

State  of Mississippi,  Cause  No.  99-0136,  pending  in  the  Circuit \nCourt  of Noxubee  County,  Plaintiff's  counsel  has  asserted  that  approximately  400  indigent \ncriminal  defendants  were  provided  ineffective  assistance  of counsel.  The  State  Defendants  filed \nsimilar  motions  to  dismiss  the  Quitman  County,  Jefferson  County,  and  Noxubee  County  matters. \nNeither  the  Jefferson  or Noxubee  County  courts  have  ruled  on the  State  Defendants’  motion  to \ndismiss. \nAdditionally,  plaintiff's  counsel  has  also  filed  suit  on behalf of the  Forrest  County  public \ndefender  against  the  State  Defendants  and  the  Forrest  County  Board  of Supervisors.  In  J.B,  Van \nSlyke  v.  State  of Mississippi,  Cause  No.  00-0013-GN-D,  pending  in  the  Chancery  Court  for \nForrest County,  plaintiffs  counsel  has  raised  the  similar  issue  of “systemic  ineffective  assistance \nof counsel.” \nThe  resolution of the  contested  legal  issues  in  the  case  at  bar  will  affect the  resolution  of \nthe  three  additional  related  suits  and  the  hundreds  of instances  of ineffective  assistance  of \ncounsel raised  therein. \n  \n \nSTATEMENT  OF  ISSUES \nI.  Whether  Article  14,  Section  216  of the  Mississippi  Constitution  and  associated  statutes \ndirecting  counties,  which  are  political  subdivisions  created  for  the  convenience  of the  State,  to \nassist  the  State  in  the  provision  of representation to  indigent  criminal  defendants  are \n“unconstitutional”  unfunded  mandates. \nII.  Whether  a county  board  of supervisors  may  raise  arguments  regarding  “systemic” \nineffective  assistance  of counsel  in  a suit  against the  State  in  an  effort to  assail  the \nconstitutionality  of al]  statutes  which  require  counties  to  assist  in the  provision  of representation \nto  indigent  criminal  defendants  when  the  complaint  alleges  that  the  actions  of the  board  caused \nthe  alleged  ineffective  assistance  of counsel. \n \nSTATEOMF ETHEN CTAS E \nStatement  of  Fac  d  Proceedings  Below \nThis  matter  is  an  interlocutory  appeal  by  the  State  of Mississippi,  Governor  Ronnie \nMusgrove,  and  Attorney  General  Mike Moore  (collectively,  the  “State  Defendants”)  from  an \norder  of the  Honorable  Elzy  Smith  denying  the  State  Defendant’s  motion to  dismiss  the  entirety \nof the  Quitman  County  Board  of Supervisors’s  (the  “Quitman  Board’s”)  complaint.’ \nI.  Mississippi  Constitutional  and  Statutory  Provisions  Requiring  Counties  To  Assist \nThe  State  In  Providing  Representation  For  Indigent  Criminal  Defendants \nArticle  14,  Section  261  of the  Mississippi  Constitution  directs  that  the  “expenses  of \ncriminal  prosecutions  shall  be  borne  by  the  county  in  which  such  prosecution  shall  be  begun.” \nThis  Court,  having  previously  reviewed  the  relationship  between  Section  261  and  public \ndefenders,  has  stated  that  Section  261  requires,  and  that  the judiciary  defers to,  the  “legislative \nimplementation  for the  determination  of what  constitutes  proper  expenses,  the  amounts  thereof or \na  method  of making  such  determination,  and  to  whom  same  should  be  paid.”  See  Board  of \nSup’rs  of George  County  v.  Bailey,  236  So.2d  420,  422  (1970).  Accordingly,  the  Legislature  has \n  \n'  The  Circuit  Court  did  grant  the  State  Defendant’s  motion to  dismiss  as  moot  Count  Two \nof the  two  count  Quitman  complaint.  See  August  30,  2000  Judgment  on  Motion  to  Dismiss  (R.E. \n5).  Count  One  alleges  that  “[b]y  imposing  the  obligation  to  fund  indigent  defense  on  counties, \ndefendants  have  breached  their  duties  under  Article  3,  Section  26  of the  Mississippi  Constitution  to \nprovide  and  fund  adequate  representation  for  indigent  criminal  defendants.”  See  Complaint  at §  24 \n(R.E.  3).  Count  Two  alleged  that  the  State’s  failure  to  appropriate  additional  funds  for  the \nMississippi  Statewide  Public  Defender  System Act  of  1998  was  a “breach  of duty.”  See id.  at  §  27. \nThe  State  Defendants moved to  dismiss Count Two  as  moot because the specific  sections of the  1998 \nact  relied  on  by  the  Quitman  Board  had  never  become  effective  and  the  entire  1998  act  had  been \nrepealed. \n  \n \nimplemented  Section  261  by  providing  that the  State  and  counties  each  bear  certain  costs  related \nto  prosecutors  and  public  defenders. \nPrior  to  the  2000  Legislative  session,  county  boards  of supervisors  were  required  by \nstatute  to  provide  public  defenders  for  indigent  criminal  defendants  charged  with  capital  and \nnon-capital  offenses.  However,  consistent with the  explicit  authority  conferred  by  the \nConstitution’,  the  Legislature  has  recently  enacted  several  measures  which  fundamentally \nchanged  the  manner  in  which  public  defenders  are  provided.  Within  the  previous  year  the \nLegislature  has  passed  and  Governor  Musgrove  has  signed  into  law  legislation  creating:  (1)  the \nMississippi  Office  of Capital  Defense  Counsel;  (2)  the  Mississippi  Office  of Capital  Post- \nConviction  Counsel;  and  (3)  the  Mississippi  Public  Defender  System  Task Force.  See generally, \nMiss.  Code  Ann.  §  99-18-1,  et seq.  (Supp.  2000)  (establishing  Office  of Capital Defense \nCounsel);  §  99-39-101,  et seq.  (Supp.  2000)  (establishing  Office  of Capital  Post-Conviction \nCounsel);  §  25-32-71,  et seq.  (Supp.  2000)  (establishing  Public  Defender  Task  Force).  The \nlegislation,  and  the  offices  created thereby,  were  effective  on  July  1,  2000. \nMr.  C.  Jackson  Williams  was  appointed  effective  September  2000  by  the  Mississippi \nSupreme  Court  as  the  director  of  Office  of Capital  Post-Conviction  Counsel.  The  office  is \nproviding  state-supported  representation to  indigent  defendants  under  sentences  of death  in post- \nconviction  proceedings.  See Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  99-39-105  (Supp.  2000).  The  Mississippi \n  \n2  And  the  recommendation  of  this  Court  in  Wilson  v.  State,  574  So.2d  1338,  134, \nencouraging the  Legislature  to  review  funding  for public  defenders  in  capital cases. \n  \n \nOffice  of Capital  Defense  Counsel  will  provide  state-supported  representation to  indigent \ndefendants  under  indictment  for  death penalty  eligible  offenses.  See  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  99-18-5 \n(Supp.  2000).  For  state  fiscal  year 2001,  the  Legislature  appropriated  approximately  two  million \ndollars  for  both  offices.  The  Mississippi  Public  Defender  Task  Force,  an  eleven  member \ncommittee  formed  by  the  Legislature  to  study  the  need  for  state-supported  indigent  defense \ncounsel, has  completed  its  statutory  responsibilities  and  submitted  a report to  the  Legislature. \nProposals  made  by  the  task  force  and  under  consideration  by  the  Legislature,  includes the \ncreation  of a  State  office  of indigent  appeals. \nAs  the  Legislature  has  removed  from  counties  the  responsibility  of providing  public \ndefenders  in  capital  cases,  counties  now  provide  public  defenders  only  for  indigent  defendants \ncharged  with  non-capital  offenses.  See  generally,  Miss.  Code  Ann,  §  25-32-1  (1999)?  With \nrespect  to  such  non-capital  offenses,  county  boards  of supervisors  have  broad  discretion  to \nreview  the  needs  of their  counties  and  fashion  their  public  defender  services  in  a  manner  that  best \naddresses  such  needs.  Supervisors  may  establish,  on their  own  or  with  one  or  more  other \ncounties,  an  office  of public  defender.  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  25-32-1  (1999).  Supervisors  have  the \ndiscretion  to  employ  any  number  of part-time  or  full-time  public  defenders  and  negotiate  any \ntype  of service  contract  with  such  public  defenders  (such  as  “flat  rate”  or  “per  hour”  contracts). \n  \n>  The  magnitude  of this  change  is  evidenced  by  the  fact that  Quitman  complaint,  filed \nbefore  the  creation  of the  State  offices  providing  public  defenders  in capital  cases,  sited  the \nfinancial  burden  on counties  in  capital  cases  as  its  primary  example  of the  “unfair”  financial \nburden  placed  on  counties.  See  Quitman  Complaint  at  ]  4.\n  \nMiss.  Code  Ann.  §  25-32-5  (1999).  However,  supervisors  are  required  by  statute  to  compensate \nthe  county’s  public  defenders  at  a  rate  at  least  equal  to  that which  the  supervisors  compensate  the \ncounty’s  prosecuting  attorney.  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  25-32-5  (1999).  Supervisors  must  also \nprovide  the  county’s  public  defenders  with  resources  at  least  equal  to  the  resources  of the \ncounty’s prosecuting  attorney.  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  25-32-7  (1999). \nFinally,  supervisors  are  authorized  to  perform  any  additional  tasks  “necessary  for  the \nefficient  operation  of  [their  public  defenders]  to  the  end  that  adequate  legal  defense  for  indigent \npersons”  is  provided.  See  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  25-32-1  (1999). \nI.  Specific  Actions  Taken By The  Quitman  Board  Regarding  Public  Defenders. \nThe  Quitman  Board  has  taken  the  following  discretionary  and  official  actions  to  provide \npublic  defenders  for  Quitman  County’s  indigent  criminal  defendants. \nA.  Plaintiff Quitman  Board  Determined  That  Two  Part-Time  County \nPublic  Defenders  Were  Sufficient  To  Serve  The  Needs  Of Quitman’s \nIndigent  Criminal  Defendants, \n  \nIn  1990,  the  Quitman  Board  passed  a resolution  by  unanimous  vote  stating  that the  Board \nwould  nominate  and  compensate  two  part-time  attorneys  to  serve  as  public  defenders  for  all \nindigent  defendants  in  Quitman  County.  See  August  6,  1990  Legal  Representation  For  Indigent \nDefendants  Resolution  (the  “Public  Defender  Resolution”)  at ff  1,  5,  6  (R.E.  7;  R.  1629-30). \nThe resolution  contains  the proviso  that  the  board  would  compensate  additional  public  defenders \nif such  defenders  were  named  by  Circuit  Judge  Elzy  Smith.  See id.  at  97.  Neither the  Quitman\nBoard  nor  Judge  Smith  have  named  a third  attorney  to  serve  as  a  part-time  or  full-time  public \ndefender  for  Quitman  County. \nB.  Plaintiff Quitman  Board  Determined  The  Type  Of Contract  And  Amount  Of \nCompensation  To  Be  Provided  The  Quitman  County  Public  Defenders. \nThe  Quitman  Board  unanimously  determined  that  the  most  appropriate  method  by  which \nto  compensate  the  two  part-time  Quitman  County  public  defenders  was,  and  continues  to  be, \npursuant to  a  “flat-rate”  contract providing  a monthly  salary  to  each  defender  regardless  of the \nnumber  or  complexity  of cases  handled.  See id.  46.  Plaintiff Quitman  Board  has  also  decided \nthat  each  of the  two  part-time  public  defenders  should  be paid  approximately  $1,350  per  month. \nSee  Deposition  of Allan  Shackelford  at  14  (R.E.  81;  R.  1551);  Deposition  of Thomas  Pearson  at \n74  (R.E.  9;  R.  1720).  During  1999,  Mr.  Shackelford  was  the  designated  public  defender  in \nfourteen  (14)  cases  in  Quitman  County.  See  Exhibit  3  to  Shackelford  Deposition  (R.E.  8;  R. \n1634).  During  1999,  Mr.  Pearson  was the  designated  public  defender  for nineteen  (19)  cases  in \nQuitman  County.  See  Exhibit  3  to  Pearson  Deposition  (R.E.  9;  R.  1778). \nC.  Plaintiff Quitman  Board  Unanimously  Selected  Thomas  Pearson  and \nAllan  Shackelford  To  Serve  As  Quitman  County Public  Defenders. \nIn the  1990  Public  Defender  Resolution,  Plaintiff Quitman  Board  unanimously  found  that \nThomas  Pearson  and  Allan  Shackelford  were  qualified  to  serve  as  the  Quitman  County  public \ndefenders  and  recommended  their  appointment to  Circuit  Judge  Elzy  Smith.  See  Public \nDefender  Resolution  at  §  6  (R.E.  7).  Messrs.  Shackelford  and  Pearson  were  so  appointed  by \nJudge  Smith  and  Mr.  Shackelford  continued  at  all  tumes  relevant  to  this  matter  to  serve  at the  will\nand  pleasure  of the  Quitman  Board.  Mr.  Pearson  was  terminated  as  a  Quitman  County public \ndefender  during  the  Summer  of 2000.  See  Pearson  Deposition  at  86-88  (R.E.  9;  R.  1732-34). \nMr.  Pearson  was  not terminated  by  the  Plaintiff Quitman  Board.  Instead,  Mr.  Pearson  was \nterminated  for  undisclosed  reasons by  Circuit  Judge  Elzy  Smith.  Id. \nD.  Plaintiff  Quitman  Board’s  Allegations  In  The  Case  At  Bar. \nThe  Quitman  Board  has  initiated  this  matter  against  the  State  Defendants  on  behalf of the \nBoard  and  the  county  taxpayers.  See  Complaint  at  §  6  (R.E.  6).  Importantly,  the  Quitman \nBoard  has  not  filed  suit  on behalf of indigent  defendants.  Id. \nTo  further  evidence  the  financial  nature  of the  Quitman  Board’s  action,  the  Board  has  not \nfiled  suit  on  behalf of the  Quitman  County  public  defenders.  See id.  Indeed,  both  Quitman \nCount  public  defenders  have  testified  that they  did  not provide  ineffective  assistance  of counsel \nor  otherwise  violate  the  constitutional  rights  of their  indigent  clients.  See  Shackelford \nDeposition  at  81,  85-88  (R.E.  8;  R.  1617,  1621-24);  Pearson  Deposition  at  96-97  (R.E.  9;  R. \n1742-43).  Upon  learning  of the  Quitman  Board’s  allegation that  Mr.  Shackelford  provided \nineffective  assistance  of counsel  to  every  indigent  criminal  defendant  he  represented  in  the \nprevious  five  years,  Mr.  Shackelford  has  threatened to  sue  the  Quitman  Board  for  defamation  of \ncharacter.  See  Shackelford  Deposition at  85-88  (R.E.  8;  R.  1621-24). \n  \n4  As  set  forth  in  detail  in  the  State  Defendants’  September  7,  2000  petition  for \ninterlocutory  appeal,  plaintiffs  counsel  has  actually  filed  three  identical  suits  in  separate  circuit \ncourts  containing  the  same  legal  and  factual  allegations  and  seeking  the  same  state-wide  relief. \nPlaintiffs  counsel  has  resisted  all  efforts  to  coordinate  either  discovery  or  resolution  of the \nredundant  cases. \n \nCouched  in  the  general  assertion  that  by  virtue  of directing  counties  to partially  fund \npublic  defenders  the  State  Defendants  have  breached  their  duties  under  “Article  3,  Section  26  of \nthe  Mississippi  Constitution  to  provide  and  fund  adequate  representation  for  indigent  criminal \ndefendants,”  the  Quitman  Board  has  made  the  following  legal  and  factual  allegations.  See \nComplaint  at  |  24  (R.E.  3). \nFirst,  the  Quitman  Board  asserts  that Article  14,  Section  261  of the  Constitution  and \nrelated  statutes that  require  counties  to  assist  the  State  in providing  public  defenders  in  non- \ncapital  cases  are  “unconstitutional”  because  such  directives  are  “arbitrary  unfunded  mandates” \nwhich  impose  “costs”  and  “tax  burdens”  on  Quitman  County.  See  Complaint  at 4]  4,  22(a), \n22(b)  (R.E.  3).  Moreover,  the  Quitman  Board  contends  that  its  unanimous  decision to  hire  only \ntwo,  part-time  public  defenders  has  resulted  in “pretrial  delays”  which  require  “Quitman  County \nto  spend  its  own  funds  to  hold  defendants  in  county  custody.”  See  Complaint  at {22(e)  (asserting \n“lack of defense  counsel”  creates  delays  and  custodial  expenses)  (R.E.  3);  Public  Defender \nResolution  at J 6  (recommending  only  two,  part-time public  defenders)  (R.E.  7). \nSecond,  the  Quitman Board  asserts  that  the  numerous  appellate  challenges  to  the \nadequacy  of counsel  and  “subsequent  retrials  undermines  confidence  in  the  administration  of \njustice  and  results  in  an  unduly  wasteful,  inefficient  and  expensive justice  system.”  See \nComplaint  at {  22(d)  (R.E.  3).  However,  plaintiff's  counsel  has  been  unable  to  identify  a  single \nQuitman  County  indigent  criminal  defendant  who  has  had  their  conviction  overturned  on  the \ngrounds  of ineffective  assistance  of counsel. \n10 \n \nThird,  the  Quitman  Board  contends  that  the  present  system  of county  public  defenders  is \n“unconstitutional”  as  it has  resulted  in  each  indigent  criminal  defendant  in  Quitman  County  in \nthe  previous  five  years  receiving  “ineffective  assistance  of counsel.”  See  Complaint  at  J  22(c) \n(R.E.  3);  Plaintiff's  Supplemental  Response  to  Interrogatory  No.  3  and  exhibit  thereto \n(identifying  approximately  215  Quitman  County  indigent  defendants  alleged  to  have  received \nineffective  assistance  of counsel)  (R.E.  10;  R.  1198-99,  1202-12). \nSpecifically,  the  Quitman  Board  has  alleged that  the  following  actions  undertaken by  the \nBoard  have  created  such  “systemic”  ineffective  assistance  of counsel: \ne  The  Quitman Board  asserts  that  its  own  “underfunding”  of its public  defenders \nhas  resulted  in  “systemic  ineffective  assistance  of counsel.”  See  Complaint \nat  {  22(c)  (stating  “chronic  underfunding”  has  created  ineffective  assistance)  (R.E. \n3);  Public  Defender Resolution  at 4  6  (establishing  compensation  of \npublic  defenders)  (R.E.  7). \n°  The  Quitman  Board  asserts  that  its  own  decision  to  use  “part-time  contract \npublic  defenders  who  work  for  a  flat  fee  constitutes  presumptive  ineffective \nassistance  of counsel.”  See  Plaintiff's  Response  to  Interrogatory  No.  13  at  13-14 \n(emphasis  in  original)  (R.E.  11;  R.  1792-93);  Complaint  at ¢  22(c)  (R.E.  3); \nPublic  Defender  Resolution  at {  6  (unanimously  hiring  part-time  contract  public \ndefenders  on  a  “flat  fee”)  (R.E.  7). \ne  The  Quitman  Board  asserts  that  the public  defenders  it  recommended  (Messrs. \nShackelford  and  Pearson)  are  incompetent and  provided  ineffective  assistance  of \ncounsel  to  every  indigent  defendant  in  the  previous  five  years  in that  the \ndefenders  failed  to,  among  other  actions,  promptly  consult  with  clients,  keep \nclients  reasonably  informed,  file  motions  to  dismiss,  file  timely  pre-trial  motions, \nadequately  prepare  for  examination  of witnesses,  call  critical  witnesses,  suppress \nevidence,  and  file  “meritorious”  speedy  trial  motions.  See  Plaintiff's  Response \nto  Interrogatory  No.  13  at  11-13  (R.E.  11;  R.  1790-92);  Public  Defender \n11 \n  \n \nResolution  at {  6  (unanimously  recommending  Messrs.  Shackelford  and  Pearson \nas  public  defenders)  (R.E.  7). \nThus,  according  to  the  legal  and  factual  allegations  maintained  in this  matter,  the \ndecisions  of the  Plaintiff Quitman  Board  has  resulted  in  “systemic  ineffective  assistance  of \ncounsel”  and,  therefore,  Article  14,  Section  261  of the  Constitution  and  related  statutes  that  direct \ncounties  to  assist the  State  in  providing  representation  for  indigent  criminal  defendants  is \n“unconstitutional.” \nIll.  Relevant  Proceedings  Before  Circuit  Judge  Elzy  Smith. \nIn  the  proceedings  before  Circuit  Court,  the  State  Defendants  filed motions  seeking  the \nrecusal  of Judge  Smith  and  the  dismissal  of the  complaint  in  its  entirety.  The  State  Defendants \nsought  recusal  on the  basis  of the  “appearance  of impropriety”  created  by Judge  Smith’s,  a \nmember  of the  Public  Defender  Commission,  presiding  as  the  finder  of fact  in  this  matter.  The \nQuitman  Board’s  allegations  are  squarely  premised upon  (and quote  extensively  from)  the \nImplementation  Report  of the  Public  Defender  Commission.  The  report  was  drafted  in  part  by \ncommissioners  Judge  Smith  and  Butch  Scipper.  Mr.  Scipper,  the  Chancery  Clerk  for  Quitman \nCounty,  is  the  de  facto  plaintiff in  this  matter,  as  evidenced  by  Mr.  Scipper’s  verification  of \nplaintiff's  interrogatory  responses.  In  sum,  the  State  Defendants  sought  the  recusal  of Judge \nSmith,  for  among  other  reasons,  to  avoid  the  appearance  that the  present  litigation  is  a  suit \nbrought  by  a public  defender commissioner,  to  be  heard by  a  public  defender  commissioner, \npremised  on the  recommendations  of the  commission  and  seeking  to  accomplish  through judicial \n12 \n \norder that  which  the  commission  failed  to  successfully  lobby  the  Legislature  to  undertake.  Judge \nSmith  denied  the  State  Defendants’  motions  for recusal.  This  Court  denied  the  State  Defendants’ \npetition  for  interlocutory  appeal  regarding  the  motions  for  recusal. \nThe  State  Defendants’  sought  dismissal  of the  complaint  in  its  entirety  (consisting  of two \ncounts)  for  failure  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief can be  granted.  See  State  Defendants’ \nMotion  to  Dismiss  (R.E.  4).  Judge  Smith denied  the  State  Defendants’  motion  with  respect  to \nCount One.*?  See  Judgement  on  Motion to  Dismiss  (R.E.  5).  The  Circuit  Court  did  grant  the \nState  Defendant’s  motion to  dismiss  as  moot  Count  Two  of the  Quitman complaint.  See id. \nCount  Two  alleged  that  the  State’s  failure  to  appropriate  additional  funds  for the  Mississippi \nStatewide  Public  Defender  System  Act  of  1998  was  a  “breach of duty.”  See  Complaint  at  §  27 \n(R.E.  3).  The  State  Defendants  moved  to  dismiss  Count  Two  as  moot  because  the  specific \nsections  of the  1998  act  relied  on  by  Quitman  County  had  never  become  effective  and  the  entire \n1998  act  had  been  repealed.  See Motion  to  Dismiss  (R.E.  4). \nThe  State  Defendants’  petitioned,  and  this  Court  granted  permission,  for  an  interlocutory \nreview  of the  lower  court’s  denial  of the  motion  to  dismiss  with respect to  Count  One.  See \nInterlocutory  Order  (R.E.  6) \n  \n>  Count  I  alleges  that  the  State  Defendants  have  “breached  their duties  under Article  3, \nSection  26  of the  Mississippi  Constitution  to  provide  and  fund  adequate  representation  for \nindigent  defendants.”  Complaint  at  §  24  (R.E.  3). \n13\nSUMMARY  OF  ARGUMENT \nThe  Quitman  Board’s  sweeping  constitutional  challenge  to  any  and  all  constitutional  or \nstatutory  requirements  that  counties  assist  the  State  in  the  provision  of representation  for  indigent \ndefendants  is  properly  subject  to  dismissal  for  failure  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief can  be \ngranted.  It  is  clear  that  even  should  the  facts  of the  complaint  be proven  true,  the  Quitman \nBoard’s  legal  theories  do  not  overcome  the  heavy presumption  of constitutionality  afforded \nstatutes  as  the  board’s  inventive  theories  are  contrary  to  the  language  of the  Mississippi \nConstitution  and  the precedents  of this  Court. \nThe  Quitman  Board’s  claim  that  “[b]y  imposing  the  obligation  to  fund  indigent  defense \n{in  non-capital  cases]  on  counties,  defendants  have  breached  their  duties  under  Article  3,  Section \n26  of the  Mississippi  Constitution”  is  factually  and  legally  unsupportable.  See  Complaint  at  J  24 \n(R.E.  3).  Simply  expressed,  requiring  counties  to  assist  in  the provision  of representation  for \nindigent  defendants  does  not  violate  any  constitutional  right  of the  counties  in  Section  26  as \nSection  26  contains  no  rights  for counties...  Moreover,  the  Quitman  Board  cannot  attempt  to \nassail  the  constitutionality  of public  defender  statutes  by  arguing  that the  Board’s  own \nimplementation  of the  statutes  has  caused  widespread  ineffective  assistance  of counsel. \nCertainly  the  Quitman  Board  cannot  create  an  alleged  constitutional  crisis  and  then  seek  to \ndeclare  the  system  unconstitutional  in  a  suit  against the  State  Defendants. \n  \n°  Article  3,  Section 26  provides  in  relevant  part,  “the  accused  shall  have  a  right  to  be  heard \nby  himself or  counsel,  or both.” \n14\n| \nAs  set  forth more  fully  below,  the  Quitman complaint  is  subject to  dismissal  as  it  fails  to \narticulate  facts  or  legal  claims  that would  overcome  the  “very  heavy  burden”  of rebutting  the \n“strong  presumption”  of constitutionality  afforded  statutes.  See  State  v.  Jones,  726  So.2d  572, \n574  (Miss.  1998); Cities of Oxford, Carthage, Starkville, and Tupelo v. Northeast Elec. Power \nAss'n,  704  So.2d  59,  65  (Miss.  1997). \nSpecifically,  the  authority  of the  Legislature  to  divide the  burden  of indigent \nrepresentation  between  itself and  counties  (“subdivisions”  and  “agencies”  of the  State)  is \nconsistent  with the  express  and  implied  authority  conveyed the  Legislature  pursuant  to  the \nConstitution.  Article  14,  Section  26]  and the  interpretative  decisions  of this  Court  clearly \n+ \nauthorize  the  Legislature to  determine  which  expenses  associated  with  prosecution  are  to  be \n“borne  by  the  county.”  See  Miss.  Const.  Article  14,  Section  261;  Board  of Sup’rs  of George \nCounty  v.  Bailey,  236  So.2d  420,  422  (Miss.  1970)  (addressing  Section  261  and  public \ndefenders).  Moreover,  the  State  has the  implicit  “creator’s  authority”  to  direct  counties,  which \nare  political  subdivisions  created  for  the  administrative  convenience  of the  State,  to  expend  funds \nfor public  services.  See  State  v.  Hinds  County  Bd.  of Sup’rs,  635  So.2d  839,  843  (Miss.  1994) \n(“anything  that  belong{s]  to  a  county  also  belong[s]  to  the  state  and  ..  .  the  state  simply  [has] \ncreator’s  power  to  control  the  county”).  Thus,  counties  have  no  cause  of action  against  the  State \nfor  “unfunded  mandates”  and  the  decision  as  to  how to  allocate  the  burden  of public  defender \nfunding  is  with the  sound  discretion  of the  Legislature.  Young  v.  State,  255  So.2d  318,  321-22 \n(Miss.  1971);  See  Complaint  at J  22(a),  22(b)  (RE.  3). \n15 \n   \nAdditionally,  it  is  clear that  even  if widespread  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  exists  in \nQuitman  County,  the  Quitman  Board  is  not  the  proper party  to  raise  the  argument  in  an  attempt \nto  undermine  the  constitutionality  of the  public  defender  statutes.  There  is  simply  no  cause  of \naction  between  the  Quitman  Board  and  the  State  Defendants premised  on  ineffective  assistance \nof counsel.  Such  is  especially  the  case  when  the  complaint  evidences  that  it  is  the \nimplementation  of the  challenged  statutes  by  the  Quitman Board  which  has  caused  the  alleged \nconstitutional  violations.  The  Quitman  Board  is  not  at  liberty  to  underfund,  improperly  contract \nwith,  and  hire  “incompetent”  public  defenders’  and  then  sue  the  State  Defendants  to  declare  the \npublic  defender  statutes  unworkable  and  unconstitutional.  Moreover, the  Quitman  Board,  suing \non  behalf of Quitman  taxpayers,  does  not  have  the  standing  to  raise en masse  arguments \n  \nconcerning  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  on  behalf of hundreds  of previously  tried  or \nunnamed  future  criminal  defendants. \nFinally,  the  Quitman  Board’s  attempt  to  strike  all  public  defender  statutes  relating  to \ncounties  on  the  basis  of a  generalized  assertion  of ineffective  assistance  is  contrary  to  the \ndecisions  of this  Court  in  Wilson v.  State,  574  So.2d  1338  (Miss.  1990)  and  Pruett  v.  State,  574 \nSo.2d  1359  (Miss.  1990).  “tT]neffective  assistance  of counsel  is  a matter  that  is  better  decided  on \na  case  by  case  basis.  .  .  .  and just  because the  [public  defender  statute]  could  have  such a result  is \nno  reason  to  declare  it  unconstitutional.”  574  So.2d  at  1341. \n  \n’  The  State Defendants  and  the  Quitman  County  public  defenders  both  vigorously  deny  the \nQuitman  Board’s  allegations  in  this  respect. \n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nI.  The  Complaint  Is  Properly  Subject  To  Dismissal  As  The  Quitman  Board’s \nAllegations  Are  Insufficient  To  Overcome  The  Applicable  Presumption  Of \nConstitutionality  Or  Otherwise  Entitle  The  Quitman  Board  To  Relief. \nThe  Quitman  Board’s  complaint  is  properly  subject  to  dismissal  for  failure  to  state  a \nclaim  upon  which  relief can  be  granted  as the  facts  alleged  in the  complaint,  even  if proven  true, \nwould  not  overcome  the  presumption  of constitutional  validity  afforded  public  defender  statutes \nor  in  any  other  manner  entitle  plaintiff to  the  relief sought.  See  Robinson  v.  Stewart,  655  So.2d \n866,  867  (Miss.  1995);  see also Davvi. Stdates ofo Genorgi a,  622  F.2d  895,  896  (Sth  Cir.  1980) \n(cited  in  Tucker  v.  Hinds  County,  558  So.2d  869,  872  (Miss.  1990)).  While  for  present purposes \nplaintiff's  factual  allegations  are  taken  as  true,  courts  evaluating  a motion  to  dismiss  for  failure  to \nstate  a  claim  are  not  bound  to  accept  the  “legal  conclusions  or  allegations  of the  legal  effect  of \nevents”  as  asserted  in  the  complaint.  Tucker,  558  So.2d  at  872.  It  is  indeed  the  Quitman  Board’s \nsweeping  legal  conclusions  which  find  no  legal  support  in  the  language  of the  Constitution  or  the \ndecisions  of this  Court. \nIt  is  well  settled  that  a  court  may  strike  down  an  act  of the  Legislature  “only  where  it \nappears  beyond  all  reasonable  doubt” that  the  statute  violates  the  clear  language  of the \nconstitution.  See James  v.  State,  731  So.2d  1135,  1136  (Miss.  1999);  Pathfinder  Coach  Division \nof  Superior  Coach  Corp.  v.  Cottrell,  62  So.2d  383,  385  (Miss.  1953).  A party  challenging  the \nstatute  must  be  able  to  “overcome  the  strong  presumption”  that  the  act  is  constitutional.  Cities  of \n  \nOxford,  Carthage,  Starkville  and  Tupelo  v.  Northeast  Elec,  Power  Ass’n,  704  So.2d  59,  65 \n\\7 \n \n(Miss.  1997);  see also James,  731  So.2d  at  1136  (statutes  are  “clothed  with a  heavy  presumption \nof constitutional  validity”);  State  v.  Jones,  726  So.2d  572,  574  (Miss.  1998)  (plaintiffs  have  a \n“very  heavy  burden  in  contesting  the  constitutionality  of a  statute”)  (internal  quotation  omitted). \nAs  “{a]ll  doubts  must  be  resolved  in  favor  of the  validity  of a  statute,”  a  challenge  will \nfail  if the  statute  “does  not  clearly  and  apparently  conflict  with  organic  Jaw  after  first  resolving \nall  doubts  in  favor  of validity.”  Northeast  Elec.  Power  Ass’n,  704  So.2d  at  65.  Pursuant  to  the \npronouncements  of this  Court: \nIn  determining  whether  an  act  of the  Legislature  violates  the  Constitution,  the \ncourts  are  without  the  right  to  substitute  their judgment  for  that  of the  Legislature \nas  to  the  wisdom  and  policy  of the  act  and  must  enforce  it,  unless  it  appears \nbeyond  all  reasonable  doubt  to  violate  the  Constitution.  Nor  are  the  courts  at \nliberty  to  declare  an  Act  (of the  Legislature)  void,  because  in  their  opinion  it  is \nopposed to  a  spirit  supposed  to  prevail  the  Constitution,  but  not  the  expressed \nwords. \nCottrell,  62  So.2d  at  385.  “It  is  not  this  Court’s  duty  to  look  for  factual  possibilities  or  scenarios \nthat would  create  conflict  with  the  statute,  thereby  rendering  the  statute  unconstitutional.  Rather, \nthis  Court’s  duty  is  to  interpret the  Act  and  envision  facts  and  scenarios  in  which  the  statute \ncould  be  held  constitutional.”  Jones,  726  So.2d  at  573  (internal  citation  omitted);  see also \nWilson  v,  State,  574  So.2d  1338,  1340  (Miss.  1990)  (applying  same  rule  of constitutional \npresumption  to  statutes  regarding  public  defender  compensation). \nThus,  and  as  more  fully  set  forth  below,  the  Quitman  Board’s  conclusory  allegation that \nthe  State  Defendants  are  constitutionally  prohibited  from  requiring  counties  to  assist  in  providing \npublic  defenders  attempts  to  mask through  vagueness the  absence  of factual  support  in  the \n18 \n  \n \ncomplaint  and  the  existence  contrary  legal  authority  which justifies  dismissal  of the  complaint. \nGiven  the  constitutional  authority  for  the  Legislature’s  directives  to  its  political  subdivision,  the \nfacts  alleged  in the  complaint,  even  if proven true,  would  not  overcome  the  presumption  of \nconstitutional  validity  afforded  public  defender  statutes  or  in  any  other manner  entitle  plaintiff to \nthe  relief sought.  See Robinson,  655  So.2d  at  867;  see also Davidson,  622  F.2d  at  896  (cited  in \nTucker,  558  So.2d  at  872). \ni.  Counties,  As  Mere  Subdivisions  And  Agencies  Of The  State,  Have  No  Cause  Of \nAction  Against  The  State  For  “Unfunded  Mandates.” \n  \nA.  The  Legislature  Has  The  Explicit  Constitutional  Authority  To  Direct \nCounties  To  Fund  Any  “Expense  Of Prosecution,”  Including  Requiring \nCounties  To  Assist  In  Providing The  Public  Defenders  Necessary  For  Such \nProsecution. \nPursuant  to  the  Mississippi  Constitution,  the  State  has  the  express  authority  to  direct \ncounties  to  expend  funds  to  assist  in the  provision  of representation  for  indigent  criminal \ndefendants.  The  Constitution’s  explicit  pronouncement  that  “the  expenses  of criminal \nprosecution  shall  be  borne by  the  county”  provides  clear constitutional  authority  for  the \nLegislature  to  require  counties to  provide  county public  defenders  in non-capital  cases.  See \nMiss.  Const.  Article  14,  Section  261.  This  Court  has previously  reviewed  whether public \ndefenders  are  an  “expense  of prosecution”  and  has  deferred  to  the  Legislature’s  determination \nthereof.  Board  of  Sup’rs  of  George  County  v.  Bailey,  236  So.2d  420,  422  (Miss.  1970)  (holding \nthat  the  Legislature  should  determine  whether public  defenders  would  be  paid  by  counties). \n“There  is  nothing  in  [Section  261]  to  indicate  what  shall  constitute  an  expense  in  criminal \n19\nprosecutions.  ....  It requires  legislative  implementation  for the  determination  of what \nconstitutes  proper  expenses,  the  amounts thereof  or  a  method  of making  such  determination,  and \nto  whom  same  should be  paid.”  Id.  Pursuant to  the  discretion  conveyed  by  Article  14,  Section \n261,  the  Legislature  has  in  fact  made  a  “determination”  that  the  compensation  of public \ndefenders  in  non-capital  cases  is  proper expense  to  be  borne  by  the  counties.  See supra  pps.  4-7. \nImportantly,  the  Legislature  has  also  determined  that public  defenders  in  capital  cases  are  to  be \nprovided  by  the  State.  See id. \nIgnoring  Article  14,  Section  261,  the  Quitman  complaint asserts  that  the  language  of \nArticle  3,  Section  26  mandates  the  State,  and  not  the  counties,  to  fund  all public  defenders.  See \nComplaint  at {  24  (R.E.  3).  As  is  evident  from  the  plain  language  of Section  26,  there  is  simply \nno  such  requirement.  Even as  Section  26  has  been  interpreted  to  include  the  personal  guarantee \nof effective  assistance  of counsel,  it  has  never  been  read to  provide  any  rights  to  counties. \nMoreover,  Section  26  has  never been  read  to  restrict the manner  in  which the  State  may \ncompensate  public  defenders.  As  this  Court  stated  in  Wilson v.  State,  “the  issue  of compensation \nfor  an  attorney  appointed  [pursuant  to  Section  26]  is  a  legislative  matter  rather than  a judicial \nmatter.”  574  So.2d  1338,  1340  (Miss.  1990);  cf  Attorney  General  v.  Interest  of B.C.M.,  744 \nSo.2d  299,  303  (Miss.  1999)  (holding  that  Constitution  mandates  that the  State  care  for the \ninsane,  but “places  no  restrictions  on  how the  Legislature  may  allot  that  duty  of care”’). \nThe  Quitman  Board’s  attempt  to  engraft  into  Article  3,  Section  26  an  explicit \nconstitutional  directive  prohibiting  the  State  from  requiring  that  its  own political  subdivisions \n20 \n \nassist  in  providing  representation  for  indigent  criminal  defendants  is  unsupported  by  a  plain \nreading  of Section  26  and  in  direct  conflict  with  the  explicit  authority  conveyed  in  Article  14, \nSection  261.  As  the  Quitman  complaint  is  unable  to  allege  a “palpable  conflict”  between the \nactions  of the  Legislature  and the  Constitution,  the  Quitman Board’s  attempt  to  declare \n' \n“unconstitutional” any constitutional  or  statutory requirement  that  counties  assist  in providing \nrepresentation  for  indigent criminal  defendants  is  properly  subject to  dismissal  for  failure  to  state \na  claim.  See  Interest  of B.C.M.,  744  So.2d  at  303;  Northeast  Mississippi  Elec.  Power  Ass’n,  704 \nSo.2d  at  65  (statute  unconstitutional  only  if “clearly  and  apparently  [in]  conflict  with  organic  law \nafter  first  resolving  all  doubts  in  favor  of validity”);  Cottrell,  62  So.2d  at  385  (statute not \nunconstitutional  if “it  is  opposed to  a  spirit  supposed  to  pervade  the  Constitution,  but  not the \nexpressed  words”). \nB.  The  Legislature  Has  The  Implicit  “Creator’s  Authority”  To  Direct  Counties, \nPolitical  Subdivisions  Created  For The  Administrative  Convenience  Of The  State, \nTo  Expend  Funds  On  Services,  Including  County  Public  Defenders. \nAs  “anything that  belong[{s]  to  the  county  also  belong[s]  to  the  State,”  the  Quitman  Board \nhas  no  legal  authority  to  support  its  assertion  that  the  State  is  constitutionally  prohibited  from \ndirecting  counties  to  assist  in  the provision of representation  for  indigent  criminal  defendants. \nSee  State  v.  Hinds  County  Bd.  Of Sup’rs,  635  So.2d  839,  843  (Miss.  1994).  Without  such  a \nlegal  basis,  the  complaint  is  rightfully  subject to  dismissal  for  failure  to  state  a  claim.  See \nDavidson,  622  F.2d  at  896  (dismissal  appropriate  when  alleged  facts  fail  to  entitle  plaintiff to \nrelief). \n2] \n  \n \nIt  has  long  been  established  that  “a  county  ...  is  a  subdivision  of the  state,  created  for \nadministration  and  other  public  purposes,  and owes  its  creation  to  the  state,  it  is  a  rule  that  it  is \n- \nsubject  at  all  times  to  legislative  control  and  change.”  State  v.  Board  of Sup’rs  of Grenada \nCounty,  105  So.  541,  546  (Miss.  1925)  (citation  omitted)  (cited  approvingly  in  Hinds  County, \n635  So.2d  at  843  (1994)).  Indeed,  counties  were  in  fact  “created  by  the  Legislature  for  political \nand  civil  purposes  as agencies  of the  state  government.”  Grenada  County,  105  So.  at  546 \n(emphasis  supplied).  As  subdivisions  and  agencies  of the  State,  “anything  that  belong[s]  to  a \ncounty  also  belong[s]  to  the  state  and...  the  state  simply  [has]  creator’s  power  to  control  the \n=. \ncounty.”  Hinds  County,  635  So.2d  at  843  (citing Leflore County v. Big Sand Drainage District, \n. \n- \n383  So.2d  501  (Miss.  1980);  Jackson  County  v.  Neville,  95  So.2d.  626,  636  (Miss.  1932); \nGrenada  County,  105  So.  at  546). \nMoreover,  it  is  undisputed  that  the  State’s  “creator’s  power”  extends  to  the  control  of \n~ \nfunds  in  the  possession of its  subdivisions  and  agencies.  In reviewing  constitutional  challenges \nto  the  Legislature’s  financial  directives  to  counties,  this  Court  has  repeatedly  found  the \nLegislature  to  have  the  authority  to  direct  that  a  county  expend  funds  in a  certain  manner  or  on  a \n. \ncertain  program.  Simply  expressed  and  fatal  to  the  Quitman complaint,  “[t]he  revenues  of a \n. \ncounty  are  subject  to  the  control  of the  Legislature,  and  when  the  Legislature  directs  their \napplication  to  a  particular purpose  or  to  the  payment  of the  claims  of particular  parties,  the \nobligation  to  so  pay  is  thereby  imposed  on the  county.”  Jackson  County,  95  So.  at  628.  In \n: \nJackson  County,  the  board  challenged  a  statute  which  provided  that  county  records  may  be \n. \n22\naudited  by  a  state  agency  and  that  the  audit would  be  paid  for  from  county  funds.  95  So.  at  628 \n(cited  approvingly  in  Hinds  County,  635  So.2d  at 843).  The  court,  dismissing  the  county’s \nchallenge,  held that: \nThe  revenues  of a county  are  not  the  property  of the  county  in  the  sense  in which \nthe  revenue  of a private  person  or  corporation  is  regarded.  The  revenues  ofa \ncounty  are  subject  to  the  control  of the  Legislature,  and  when  the  Legislature \ndirects  their  application to  a particular purpose  or to  the  payment  of the  claims  of \nparticular  parties,  the  obligation to  so  pay  is  thereby  imposed  on  the  county. \nId.  at  629. \nIn  1994,  the  issue  of the  Legislature’s  authority to  require  counties  to  expend  funds  on \nspecific  services  was  revisited  and  reiterated.  In Hind  unty,  supervisors  asserted  that  the \nState  should bear  the  cost  of housing  State  prisoners  in  county  facilities.  635  So.2d  at  841 \n(“Hinds  County  argued that  this  inadequate  [$10.00  per  day]  reimbursement  resulted  in the \ncounty  being  forced to  pay  for  a majority  of the  costs  of housing  state  inmates.”)  The  claims  of \nthe Hinds  County  Supervisors  are  identical  to those  of the  Quitman  Supervisors.  See  Complaint \nat  |  22(e)  (“pretrial  delays  have  caused  Quitman  County  to  spend  its  own funds  to  hold \ndefendants in  county  custody,  even though those  costs  properly  should be  borne  by  the  State”) \n(R.E.  7).  The  Hinds  County court,  relying  on  the  Jackson  County and  Grenada County  decisions \nreferenced  above,  restated that “the  revenues  of a county  are  subject to  the  control  of the \nLegislature.”  635  So.2d  at  843  (quoting  Jackson  County,  95  So.2d  at  629).  The  court  found  that \nthe  supervisors’  complaint was properly  subject  to  a motion  to  dismiss  because  statutes  which \n23 \n \nrequire  counties  to  fund  specific  services  violate  “no  constitutional  right”  of the  counties.’  See \n635  So.2d  at  843;  cf.  City  of Jackson  v.  State,  676  So.2d  257,  259-260  (Miss.  1996)  (affirming \n12(b)(6)  dismissal  as  city  lacked  standing  to  challenge  State  statute  regarding  State  property). \nAs  the  Legislature  has  the  implicit  constitutional  authority  to  direct  counties,  as \nsubdivisions  and  agencies  of the  State,  to  assist  in providing  representation  for  indigent  criminal \ndefendants,  the  Quitman  complaint  is  unable  to  allege  a  “palpable  conflict”  between  the  actions \nof the  Legislature  and the  Constitution.  The  Quitman  Board’s  attempt  to  declare \n“unconstitutional”  any  constitutional  or  statutory  requirement  that  counties  assist  in  providing \nrepresentation  for  indigent  criminal  defendants  is  properly  subject to  dismissal  for  failure  to  state \naclaim.  See  Interest  of  B.C.M.,  744  So.2d  at  303;  Northeast  Mississippi  Elec.  Power  Ass'n,  704 \nSo.2d  at  65;  Cottrell,  62  So.2d  at  385. \n  \n®  The  Quitman  Board  reargues  a  second  legal  claim  rejected  by  the  Hinds  County  Court. \nThe  Quitman  complaint  asserts  that  placing  the  cost  of indigent  defense  on  counties  results  in \n“unequal  tax  burdens”  between  counties.  See  Complaint  at  J  22(b)  (R.E.  3).  Although  the \nQuitman  Board  fails  to  declare  which provision of the  Constitution  is  violated by  their  allegation, \nthe  Hinds  County  decision  found  that  “unequal”  financial  burdens  between  counties  does  not \nviolate  Section  112  of the  Mississippi  Constitution.  See  635  So.2d  at  845. \n24\nC.  As  Between  The  State  And  Its  Subdivisions  And  Agencies,  Decisions  As  To \nThe  Financing  Of Public  Defenders  Is  A  Legislative  Matter Which  Counties \nHave  No  Authority  To  Challenge In  Court. \n  \nStripped  of the  fanfaranade  of rhetoric  regarding  a  “fair  and  efficient  indigent  defense \nsystem,”  the  Quitman  Board  has  initiated  a challenge  devoid  of legal  or  factual  support.  As  is \nevident  from  the  complaint,  the  Board,  suing  only  on  behalf of its taxpayers  and nbote onh  alfo f \nindigent  defendants  or  public  defenders,  decries  the  “indigent  defense  costs”  and  “tax  burdens” \nplaced  on  Quitman  County  for public  defenders.  See  Complaint  at  J  22(a),  22(b)  (R.E.  7).  As \nthe  State  provides  public  defenders  in  all  capital cases,  the  Legislature  has  directed  counties  to \nassist  in the  provision  of representation  for  indigent  criminal  defendants  by  providing  public \ndefenders  only  in  non-capital  cases.”  There  exists  no  constitutional  restriction  on  the  ability  of \nthe  State  to  allocate  the  costs  of indigent  defense  between  the  State  and  its  subdivisions  and \nagencies. \nThe  decisions  of this  Court  have  consistently  recognized  that  determinations  regarding \nthe  best manner  (or the  “efficient”  manner)  to  fund  public  defenders  is  a  public  policy  decision \nwithin  the  purview  of the  Legislature. \nOne  of the  fundamental  constitutional  principles  is  the  division  of governmental \npowers.  The  Mississippi  Constitution  specifically  enjoins  each  department  from \nexercising  the  powers  vested  in  either  of the  others.  The  authority  to  empower \npayment  of attorneys  who  are  required  by  court  order  to  defend  indigents  .  .  .  isa \nlegislative  matter  or  a judicial  matter;  it  cannot  be  both.  ..  .  Sections  1  and  2  of \nour  Constitution  are  clear on  this  point.  The  appropriation  of public  funds  is \n  \n>  To  provide  context  for  the  Quitman  Board’s  arguments,  Quitman  County  spent  $32,400 \nin  state  fiscal  year  1999  on  counsel  expenses  for public  defenders. \n25\ntraditionally  within  the  exclusive  province  of the  legislature.  While  the  judiciary \npossesses  the  inherent  power to  appoint  counsel  to  defend  indigents,  it  does  not \nfollow  that  courts  can  order the  expenditure  of public  funds  to  pay  their  fees. \nThe  legislature  is  the  appropriate  branch  of the  government to  deal  with  this \nmatter  because  it  can  conduct  hearings  to  determine  the  extent  of the  need,  the \namount  of funds  required,  and  the  numerous  related  factors  involved.  While  the \nlegislature  can  view  the  full  spectrum  of the  problem,  the  courts  which  do  not \nhave  the  means  or  facilities  to  adequately  study the  problem  or provide  the \nremedy,  can  only deal  with  the  problem  on  a  case  by  case  basis. \nYoung  v.  State,  255  So.2d  318,  321-322  (Miss.  1971)  (quoting  Board  of Sup’rs  of George \nCounty  v.  Bailey,  236  So.2d  420,  423  (Miss.  1970)). \nIn  a  holding  which  reiterated  the  Legislative  role  discussed in  Young,  the  Wilson \ndecision  further  supports  dismissal  of the  Quitman  complaint.  In  contrast  to  the  allegations  of \nthe  Quitman  Board,  in Wilson  an  actual  indigent criminal  defendant  alleged that  the  statutory \nmaximum  for  public  defender  compensation was  unconstitutional  as  it  denied  him  and  other \ndefendants  the  “effective  assistance  of counsel.”  574  So.2d  1338,  1339-40  (Miss.  1990).  With \nrespect  to  the  Article  3,  Section  26  “effective  assistance  of counsel”  claims  raised by  both the \nQuitman  Board  and  the  Wilson  indigent  defendant,  the  challenge  raised  by  the  Wilson  defendant \n  \nwas  much  more  serious  and  yet this  Court reiterated  that  the  Legislature  is  the  proper  branch  to \ndetermine  the  method  for  compensating  public  defenders.  The  Wilson  defendant  challenged the \n  \namount  of compensation  to  be  provided  to  his  public  defenders.  574  So.2d  at  1340.  In  contrast, \nthe  Quitman  Board’s  complaint  is  properly  read  to  challenge  the  source  of the  compensation \n  \n26 \n  \n \n(county  or  State)  and  not  the  amount  thereof.'?  See  Complaint  at  ]  2  (R.E.  3).  In  addressing  the \nchallenge  to  the  amount  of public  defender  compensation,  the  Wilson  Court  stated: \nWhile  we  do have  the  authority  to  override  the  Legislature  in  cases  of absolute \nnecessity,  we  have  previously  held  that  the  issue  of compensation  for an  attorney \nappointed  to  defend  an  accused  in  a  criminal  case  is  a  legislative  matter  rather \nthan  a judicial  matter. \nAlthough  we recognize  our  inherent  authority  to  provide  counsel  for  indigents,  we \nrefused to  interfere  with the  Legislature’s  right  to  expend public  funds.  The \nLegislature  is  better equipped to  handle  this  matter. .  .. \n574  So.2d  at  1340.  It  follows  directly  from  this  Court’s  discussion  of the  Legislature’s  “right  to \nexpend  public  funds”  that  if the  Legislature  has  the  right  under Article  3,  Section  26  to  determine \nthe  amount  of public  defender  compensation,  then  the  Legislature  also  has  the  right to  determine \nthe  source  of such  funding.  As  such  the  Quitman  Board’s  allegation  that  Article  3,  Section  26 \nexplicitly  prohibits the  Legislature  from  requiring  counties  (subdivisions  and  agencies  of the \nState)  to  assist  in  indigent  criminal  representation  is  legally  unsupportable  and  properly  subject \nto  dismissal. \n  \n'0  In  the  alternative,  a  challenge  by  the  Quitman  Board  to  the  amount  of compensation \nprovided  public  defenders  fares  no  better.  Even  though  such  a  challenge  by  t he  Board  is  improper \ngiven,  among  other  items,  the  Board’s  role  in  setting  such  compensation,  Section  III  of this  brief, \nthe  Wilson  decision clearly  states  that “we  have previously  held that the  issue  of compensation  [for \npublic  defenders]  is  a  legislative  matter  rather than  a judicial  matter.”  574  So.2d  at  1340. \n27 \n \n :\nIII.  The  Quitman  Board  Is  Not  The  Proper  Party  To  Raise  “Ineffective  Assistance  Of \nCounsel”  To  Assail  The  Constitutionality  Of The  Public  Defender  System. \nFor  the  purposes  of a  complete  record,  the  State  Defendants  and  the  Quitman  County \npublic  defenders  vigorously  deny  that  “systemic  ineffective  assistance  of counsel”  exists  in \nQuitman  County.  See  Shackelford  Deposition  at  81,  85-88  (R.E.  8;  R.  1621-24);  Pearson \nDeposition  at  96-97  (R.E.  9;  R.  1742-43).  However,  even  if such  ineffective  assistance  of \ncounsel  existed,  the  Quitman  Board  is  procedurally  and  substantively  prohibited  from  raising \n \nz\na\nw\nsuch  an  argument  against  the  State  Defendants  in  an  effort  to  avoid  its  responsibility  to  assist  in \n \na providing  representation  for  indigent  defendants.  When  the  Quitman  Board’s  factual  and  legal \nallegations  are  examined  in  detail,  it  is  evident  that  there  is  no  cause  of action  between  the \n :\nQuitman Board  and  State  Defendants  regarding  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  and  that  the \n \nm\nQuitman Board  is  not the  proper  party to  raise  issues  of Quitman  County  public  defender  funding \na\nor  competence. \nA.  The  Quitman  Board  Has  No  Cause  Of Action  Against  The  State  For  “Failure \n  To  Provide  Adequate  Representation”  When  The  Complaint  Alleges  That \na\nw The  Actions Of The  Board  Caused  The  Ineffective  Assistance  Of Counsel. \nEven  the  most  inventive  interpretations  of an  individual’s  right  to  counsel  contained  in \nArticle  3,  Section  26  of the  Constitution  will  not  support  a  suit  by  the  Quitman  Board  against  the \nState  for  an  alleged  failure  to  “provide  adequate  representation  for  indigent  criminal  defendants” \n28\nwhen the  Quitman  complaint  acknowledges  that  it  was  the  discretionary  and unanimous  the \ndecisions  of the  Quitman  Board  which  have  caused  the  alleged  constitutional  violations. \nFirst,  the  complaint  asserts  that  “chronic  underfunding  of indigent  defense”  in  Quitman \nCounty  has  resulted  in  wide-spread  systemic  ineffective  assistance  of counsel.  See Complaint  at \nq  22(c)  (R.E.  3).  However,  was  is  Plaintiff Quitman  Board which,  through  a  unanimous  vote  set \nthe  salary  of the  Quitman  County  public  defenders  and decided  that  no  other resources  need  be \nprovided  to  the  defenders.  See Public  Defender  Resolution  at  4  6  (R.E.  7). \nSecond,  the  Quitman Board  asserts  that the  use  of “part-time  contract  public  defenders \nwho  work  for a  flat  fee  constitutes  presumptive  ineffective  assistance  of counsel.”  See  Plaintiffs \nResponse  to  Interrogatory  No.  13  at  13-14  (emphasis  in  original)  (R.E.  11;  R.  1792-93). \nHowever,  it  was  Plaintiff Quitman  Board  that  decided  to  hire  only  part-time public  defenders. \nSee Public  Defender  Resolution  at § 6  (R.E.  7).  Moreover,  it  was  by  unanimous  vote  of the \nQuitman  Board  that  such  defenders  were  hired  on  a  “flat  fee”  contract  basis.  See id.  There  is  no \nstatutory  or  other  directive  that  required the  Quitman Board  utilize  a  “flat  fee”  contract  or  hire \npart-time  defenders. \nFinally,  the  Quitman  Board  argues  that  the  Quitman  County  public  defenders,  Messrs. \nShackelford  and  Pearson,  were  so  incompetent  as  to  render  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  to \neach  criminal  defendant they  represented  because the  defenders  failed  to,  among  other  actions, \npromptly  consult  with  clients,  keep  clients  reasonably  informed,  file  motions  to  dismiss,  file \ntimely  pre-trial  motions,  adequately  prepare  for  examination  of witnesses,  call  critical  witnesses, \n29\nsuppress  evidence,  and  file  “meritorious”  speedy  trial  motions.  See  Plaintiff's  Response  to \nInterrogatory No.  13  at  11-13  (emphasis  in  original)  (R.E.  11;  R.  1790-92).  However,  it  was  the \nQuitman Board,  and  not  the  State  Defendants,  which  unanimously  recommended that  Messrs. \nShackelford  and  Pearson  serve  as  the  Quitman  County  public  defenders.  Public  Defender \nResolution  at  J  6  (R.E.  7).  Mr.  Shackelford  continues  to  serve  as  a Quitman  county  public \ndefender  at  the  will  and  pleasure  of the Board.  The  State  Defendants  had  no  role  in  the  Quitman \nBoard’s  decision regarding  which  attorneys  should be  hired  as  public  defenders. \nTaking  the  Quitman  Board’s  allegations  as  true  for  the  purposes  of this  motion,  there  is \nsimply  no  legal  theory  which  supports  the  Board’s  ability  to  allegedly  underfund,  improperly \ncontract  for,  and  hire  incompetent  public  defenders  and then  point  to  such  alleged  “systemic” \ndeficiencies  as  evidence  that  the  State  Defendant’s  are  denying  the  constitutional  rights  of \nQuitman  County  taxpayers. \nTaking  the  allegations  of the  Quitman  Board as  true,  it  is  not  the  statute  itself which  has \ncaused  ineffective  assistance  of counsel.  Instead,  it  is  the  Quitman  Board’s  unanimous  actions  in \nimplementing  the  statute  which  has  allegedly  caused  the  constitutional  violations  at  hand.  Thus, \nthe  complaint  is  properly  subject  to  dismissal  as  there  exists  no  legal  theory  whereby  the \nQuitman  Board  can underfund  its  public  defenders  and  then  sue  the  State  Defendants  to  have  the \npublic  defender  statutes  declared  unconstitutional. \n30 \n  \n \nB.  The Quitman Board Lacks  Standing To Assert The Individual Right To Counsel \nOn  Behalf  Of  215  Previously  Tried  Indigent  Defendants  Or  On  Behalf  Of \nUnnamed  Future  Indigent  Criminal  Defendants. \n  \nPlaintiff Quitman  Board  has  initiated  this  suit  only  on  behalf of members  of the  board  and \nthe  taxpayers  of Quitman  County.  See  Complaint  at {6  (R.E.  3).  The  theme  of the  complaint  in \nthis  respect  is  clear--  the  board  believes  that  the  Quitman  taxpayers  should  not  have  to  bear  any \ncost  or  burden  whatsoever relating  to  the  provision of public  defenders.  See  Complaint  at §  2 \n(R.E.  3).  However,  in  addition  to  the  financial  arguments  discussed  infra in  Section  II  of this \nbrief,  the  Quitman  Board  seeks  redress  from  the  State  Defendants  for  violations  of the  individual \nconstitutional  right to  counsel  embodied  in  the  Sixth  Amendment  to  the  United  State \nConstitution  and  Article  3,  Section 26  of the  Mississippi  Constitution.  See Complaint at  24 \n(R.E.  3).  Given  the  individual  nature  of the  right to  counsel,  the  frequency  in  which  the  right  is \nreviewed  in  appellate  criminal  proceedings,  and the  Board’s  self-acknowledged  role  in  the \nalleged  violations,  the  Quitman  Board  does  not  have  standing  to  raise  the  right  to  counsel  in \ngeneral,  on  behalf of  215  previously  tried  indigent  criminal  defendants,  or on  behalf of unnamed \nfuture  indigent  defendants. \n‘It  is  undisputed  that  the  Board  is not  claiming  to  assert  its  constitutional  right  to  counsel \nor  a  general  right  to  counsel  on  behalf of taxpayers.  The  right  to  counsel  is  an  individual \nconstitutional  right  available  exclusively  to  criminal  defendants.  Neither  the  Quitman  Board  nor \nthe  Quitman  taxpayers  have  such  a  right  as  “[nJo  court  ..  .  has  ever  held  that the  Sixth \nAmendment  protects  the  rights  of anyone  other  than  criminal  defendants.”  Portman  v.  County  of \n31 \n   \nSanata  Clara,  995  F.2d  898,  902  (9th  Cir.  1993);  accord  Kinoy  v.  Mitchell,  851  F.2d  591,  594 \n  \n(2d  Cir.  1988)  (holding  right  to  counsel  creates  no  rights  for the  attorney  or  anyone  other than \ndefendant). \nWithout  the  ability  to  assert the  individual  right  to  counsel  directly,  and  having  brought \nthe  suit  only  in  the  name  of the  Board  members  and  taxpayers,  the  complaint  does  not  even \ncontain  the  barest  of explanation  as  to  whose  individual  right  to  counsel  is  being  indirectly \nasserted.  Moreover,  it  is  clear that  the  Quitman  Board  does  not  have  standing  to  raise  en  masse \nthe  individual  constitutional  rights  of 215  previously  tried  indigent  defendants  or unnamed  future \nindigent  criminal  defendants. \nAs  a  general  proposition,  courts  have  recognized  that  individual  constitutional  rights  for \ncriminal  defendants  are  different  than  ordinary  claims  with  regard  to  standing.  The  difference  is \nso  stark that  a  criminal  defendant  lacks  the  ability  to  assert  the  constitutional  rights  of a  co- \ndefendant  even  in  situations  in  which  the right  would  be  beneficial  to  the  asserting  defendant. \nSee  United  States  v.  Sims,  845  F.2d  1564,  1568  (8th  Cir.  1988)  (holding  individuals  cannot \nassert  co-defendant’s  right  to  counsel);  Kennedy  v.  Fenton,  Civ  No.  89-0241,  1990  WL  118055, \n*]  (Aug.  13,  1990  E.D.  Pa.)  (holding  individual  cannot  assert  co-worker’s  right  to  counsel); \nKansas  v.  American  Oil  Co.,  446  P.2d  754,  757  (Kan.  1968)  (holding  employer  cannot  assert \nemployee’s  right to  counsel);  cf.  Alderman  v.  United  States,  394  U.S.  165,  174,  89  S.Ct.  961, \n966  (1969)  (“Fourth  Amendment  rights  are personal  rights  which,  like  some  other  constitutional \nrights,  may  not be  vicariously  asserted.”);  Ware  v.  State,  410  So.2d  1330,  1331  (Miss.  1982) \n32\n(holding  defendant  may  not  assert  Fourth  Amendment rights  of co-defendant).  The  Quitman \nBoard  is  subtly  seeking  a  sea  change  in the  context  of criminal  litigation  --  the  ability  of a third \nparty  to  vicariously  assert personal  constitutional  rights  of criminal  defendants.’’  The  Quitman \nBoard  simply  does  not  have  standing  to  assert  en masse the  individual  constitutional  rights  of \n215  previously  tried  indigent  defendants  or unnamed  future  indigent  criminal  defendants. \nMoreover,  even  under the  lenient  standing  requirements  afforded  rights  which  are,  unlike \nthe  issues  at  bar,  not  individual  constitutional  guarantees  of criminal  defendants,  the  Quitman \nBoard  still  lacks  standing to  raise  such  issues  on behalf of its  taxpayers.  The  standing \nrequirements  of Mississippi  courts  do  not this  type  of systemic  constitutional  challenge  unless \nthere  is  “no  probability”  of the  statute  being  challenged  by  a  person  protected  by  the  statute.  See \nVan  Slyke  v.  Bd,  Of Trustees  of State  Institutions  of Higher  Learning,  613  So.2d  872,  875  (Miss. \n1993)  (quoting  Board  of Trustees  of State  Institutions  of Higher  Learning  v.  Van  Slyke,  510 \nSo.2d  490,  497  (Prather,  J.,  dissenting)).  Indeed,  the  complaint admits  that  issues  of “ineffective \nassistance  of counsel”  are  frequently  reviewed  on  appeal.  Complaint  at  §  22(d)  (R.E.  3);  see also \nWilson,  574  So.2d  at  1340.\"  As  there  is  every probability  that the  adequacy  of public  defender \nfunding  has  been,  and  will  continue  to  be,  challenged  in  proper criminal  proceedings,  the \n  \n‘'  Moreover,  the  Quitman  Board  seeks  to  assert  the  individual  constitutional  rights  of \ncriminal  defendants  in  a  separate  civil  setting  even  though  many  of the  previously  tried  indigent \ncriminal  defendants  have  already  asserted  and  lost  such  arguments  in their  criminal  appeals. \n‘2  The  Quitman  Complaint  even  alleges  that  “ineffective  assistance”  is  reviewed  so \nfrequently  as  to  “undermine confidence  in  the  administration of justice.”  See  Complaint  at  J  22d) \n(R.E.  3). \n33 \n \nQuitman  Board  lacks  the  standing  to  raise  en  masse the  individual  constitutional  rights  of 215 \npreviously  tried  indigent  defendants  or  unnamed  future  indigent  criminal  defendants. \nFinally,  and  demonstrative  of plaintiff's  flawed  complaint,  the  Quitman  Board  fails  to \nfulfill  a  crucial  element  of even the  “colorable  interest”  standing  analysis.  “Standing  to  sue  is \nconferred  upon  one  who  has  a colorable  interest  in  the  subject  matter  or who  is  adversely \naffected  beyond  other members  of the  general  public.”  Zimmerman  v.  Three  Rivers  Planning \nand  Development  Dist.,  747  So.2d  853,  859  (Miss.App.  1999).  As the  Quitman Board  has \ninitiated  this  suit  on  behalf of the  Quitman  County  general  public  (the  Quitman  County \ntaxpayers),  the  Quitman  Board  lacks  a  suitable  “colorable  interest”  in  the  individual \nconstitutional  rights  of criminal  defendants  from  which to  launch  its  en masse  review. \n  \nC,  The  Quitman  Board’s  Constitutional  Challenge  To  The  Public  Defender \nStatutes  By  Means  Of A  Generalized  Assertion  Of Ineffective  Assistance  On \nBehalf Of Hundreds  Of Previous  Indigent Defendants  Or  Unnamed  Future \nIndigent  Defendants  Is  Contrary  To  The  Clear Precedent  Of This  Court. \nA  challenge  almost  identical  in  scope  and  substance  to  the  allegations  of the  Quitman \nBoard  has  been  reviewed  and  rejected  by  this  Court  in  Wilson  v.  State,  574  So.2d  1338  (Miss. \n1990)  and  Pruett v.  State,  574  So.2d  1359  (Miss.  1990).  The  indigent  criminal  defendant  in \nWilson  asserted  that the  statutory  limitation  on  public  defender  compensation  systematically \ndeprived  “indigent  defendants”  of their Article  3,  Section  26  right to  effective  counsel.  574 \nSo.2d  at  1340.  Indeed,  the  Quitman  Board  has  made  the  same  allegation.  The  complaint  alleges \nthat  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §  99-15-17  (along  with  other  statutes)  systematically  deprives  indigent \n34 \n \ndefendants  of their Article  3,  Section  26  right  to  effective  counsel.  See  Complaint  at  Prayer  for \nRelief (a)(iii)  and  J  24  (R.E:  3).  Both  the  Wilson  indigent  defendant  and  the  Quitman  Board \nargued  for the  complete  removal  of the  statute  on  constitutional  grounds. \nIn  reviewing  the  Wilson  indigent  defendant’s  constitutional  claims,  this  Court  rejected \nthe  defendant’s  systemic  challenge  for  reasons  which  now  have  greater weight  in  light  of the \neven  more  sweeping  generalizations  in  the  Quitman  complaint. \nWhen a  statute  can  be  interpreted  either  as  constitutional  or  unconstitutional,  we \nhave  long  held  that  we  will  adopt  the  constitutional  construction.  If possible,  we \nwill  construe  it  so  as to  enable  it to  withstand  the  constitutional  attach  and  to  carry \nout  the  purpose  embedded  in  the  statute. . \nThe  argument  concerning  the  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  is  a matter  that  is \nbetter  decided  on  a  case  by  case  basis.  As  one  court  has  held,  those  rare  cases \nwhere  counsel  has  been  ineffective  may  be  handled  and  determined  individually \nby  the  appellate  courts  and just  because  the  limitation  could  have  such a  result  is \nno  reason  to  declare  it  unconstitutional. \n547  So.2d  at  1341  (internal  quotations  and  citations  omitted).  The  Wilson  court’s  skepticism  for \nstriking  down  a  single statute  as  unconstitutional  on  a  generalized  ineffective  assistance  of \ncounsel  argument  is  appropriate  for,  and  the  concerns  magnified  by,  the  Quitman  Board’s \nattempt  to  declare  an  entire  type  of public  defender system  --  any  system  in  which  counties  assist \nin  funding  representation  --  unconstitutional  on  the  generalized  argument  of ineffective \nassistance  of counsel. \nAdditionally,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the Wilson  court  rejected  the  indigent \ndefendant’s  systemic  challenge  even  though  the  defendant  had  been  represented  by  a public \n35 \n     \n \n \ne defender  in  a capital  offense  case.  See  547  So.2d  at  1339.  As  of July  1,  2000,  all public \ne\ndefenders  in  capital  cases  are  provided  by the  State  and  not the  counties.  Thus,  there  is  exists  no \n \nee\ne\nlegal  support  for  a departure  from  the  requirements  expressed  in  Wilson that  ineffective \n \n  \nassistance  of counsel  is  resolved  on  a  case  by case  basis  and public  defender  statutes  are  not \nEe\ne declared  wholesale  unconstitutional  on  the  basis  of over  generalizations  regarding  Article  3, \ne  Section  26.

The MTLA and the MBA also jointly filed a brief as amici curiae in\nI\nWilson State, 574 So. 2d 1338 (Miss. 1990). Both organizations are uniquely concerned\nabout improving the current level of representation indigent defendants receive from\nI\ndefense counsel. Moreover, because the MTLA includes many criminal defense lawyers\nI\nand former prosecutors and the MBA includes a number of lawyers appointed to\n\\.II\n\\\nI\n\\\n\nI\nI\nI represent indigent defendants on a piecemeal basis, amici can attest to the fact that the\ncurrent system fails to provide effective assistance of counsel.\nI\nArgument\nI I. THE CURRENT INDIGENT DEFENSE SYSTEM DOES NOT\nPROVIDE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AND\nUNDERMINES THE INTEGRITY OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM\nI\nThe State provides no funding for indigent defense except for some limited\ni\nfunding in capital cases and imposes the obligation to provide indigent defense in almost\nall felony cases on counties, many of which are very poor. Because they cannot afford to\nI\ndo more, the vast majority of counties in Mississippi utilize the services of part-time\nI\ndefenders, who also have to maintain private practices to support their families. This\ncounty-based indigent defense system does not provide the necessary tools of an adequate\nI\ndefense including client communication, factual investigation, informed plea negotiation,\nI\nmotion practice and use of experts. These shortcomings are inherent in the existing part-\ntime system and cannot be cured at the county level. The incentives created by a part-\nI\ntime system allowing for private practices lead attorneys to minimize the amount of time\nI\nspent representing indigent clients. Further, because public defenders are usually\nI judicially appointed, there is a real risk of lack of independence and going along with the\ncourt and prosecution to move cases along rather than zealously representing the client.\nI\nThe vast disparity between the resources provided by the State to the prosecution and the\nI minimal resources available to public defenders adds to the inadequacy of representation.\nChronic underfunding of indigent defense has resulted in constitutional\ni\nrequirements for effective assistance of counsel often not being met and has adversely\nI\naffected the administration of justice in Mississippi. The poor and uneducated, who are\nI\n\nI\nI\ndisproportionately minorities, in many cases are effectively without representation. This\nI\nsituation undermines public trust in the justice system and furthers the cynical view that\nI\nthere is one law for the rich and one for the poor.\nI 11. JUDICIAL INTERVENTION IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A\nCONSTITUTIONALLY ADEQUATE INDIGENT DEFENSE\nSYSTEM\nI\nA statewide indigent defense system with resources comparable to the prosecution\nI is necessary, tbr a properly functioning adversary system. A full-time public defender\noffice is needed to deliver indigent defense services in a constitutionally adequate manner\nI\nin Mississippi. Such an office would need an adequate salary; investigative support;\nI\nsecretarial and other support; office space; access to legal resources; a computer system;\nprofessional supervision and consulting attorneys; and the ability to bring in other\nI\nlawyers when there is a conflict of interest. Tile resources required are far beyond tile\nI\nmeans ofahnost all Mississippi counties. It is clear that the establishment of a full-time\npublic defender office requires state action and state funding.\nI\nThis Court and numerous study commissions have identified serious problems in\nI\nthe county-based indigent defense system and urged the Legislature to replace it with a\nstatewide, state-funded system. Notably, the 2000 Public Defender Task Force compiled\nI\nreports by Senior Circuit Judges describing inadequate representation they observed in\nI\ntheir districts. But these calls for State funding have gone unheeded except for some very\nI limited funding in capital cases.\nIt is clear from the history of indigent defense, and from the history of other\nI\nepisodes of legal reform in Mississippi, that judicial intervention is required to make\nI constitutional guarantees a reality. Left to its own devices, the Legislature will not take\nI\n\nI\nI\nI action to secure the rights of politically unpopular criminal defendants. However, far\nmore is at stake here, because the right to the effective assistance of counsel in criminal\nI\ncases is a vital component of each individual's fundamental right to life and liberty. This\nI right is essential to the well being of all citizens and to a fair and efficient system of\njustice in Mississippi. The prompt appointment and effective assistance of counsel for\nI\nindigent defendants is necessary to ensure that the innocent are not wrongfully convicted\nI\nand that those found guilty by due process of law are incarcerated in a timely manner.\nThe creation of a fair and efficient indigent defense system will benefit crime victims,\nI\ntaxpayers, law enforcement officials and everyone else with an interest in the criminal\nI\njustice system.\nConclusion\nI\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Circuit Court should be reversed\nI\nand the Court should order the implementation ofa statewide and state-funded full-time\nI public defender system.\nDated: Jul _ 2004\nI\nRespectfully submitted,\nI\nMISSISSIPPJ_ TRIAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION\nI\nl_enltida P.-(_oxaveql..lr;,\nI President, MTLA\nMississippi Bar No. \"7'7 _ 2..\nP.O.

THE MISSISSIPPI CHANCERY AND CIRCUIT CLERKS' SERVE A\nCRITICAL ROLE IN MISSISSIPPI'S PROVISION OF JUSTICE.\nAs a result of their similar missions, the Mississippi Chancery. and Circuit Clerks\"\nAssociations share the important purpose of studying, understanding and promoting effective and\n3\n\nI\nI\nI efficient justice in Mississippi. Perhaps even more importantly, the members of these\nassociations work with and serve Mississippi's citizens and its many servants of justice. From\nI\nthe judiciary itself, to citizens haled before the state courts, to the multiple employees who work\nI daily within the court system, the Circuit and Chancery Court Clerks' of Mississippi undertake\nthe proverbial hard job of making the trains run on time. In so doing, Amici Association\n!\nMembers interact daily with prosecutors, defense attorneys, court personnel, stenographers, and\nI the countless others who have to work within the limited budget allotted them, particularly in\nlight of the financial crises many Mississippi counties now face. Amici are -- in no uncertain\nI\nterms -- longstanding and faithful friends of the Mississippi courts. And in serving Mississippi\ni\nand its many courts, Amici seek to ensure that the machinery of justice functions as well as it can\nwithin the limited budgetary resources available to them.\nI\nI!. MISSISSIPPI COUNTY RESOURCES, ALREADY STRAINED, ARE\nINADEQUATE TO ENSURE JUDICIAL AND COURT INTEGRITY.\ni\nThere is one financial reality facing all of Mississippi's 82 counties - their budgets are\nstrained and their financial resources are taxed to their limit. This is a fact that undoubtedly\nI\nfaces all of Mississippi's state and county governmental units alike. Nevertheless, it is also a\nI\nfinancial crisis that falls particularly hard upon the poorest of Mississippi's counties, their\ncitizens, and their governments. Like Quitman County, many of those counties have both small\nI\ntax bases, and as a related consequence, large percentages of young and old citizens\ni\ndisproportionately dependent upon government services.\nIn the over forty years, since this Court ordered in Conn. v. State, 170 So. 2d 20 (Miss.\nI\n1964), that it is the obligation of the State to provide indigent defendants with counsel where\nI\nthey could not aflbrd it, the Legislature of the State of Mississippi has failed to allocate funding\nto pay for that defense counsel. While that might be called an \"unfunded mandate\" by the\ni\n4\nI\n\nI\nI\nLegislature (a number of which have been placed upon the counties), for the counties, it is a\nI\nheavy financial burden, driving some into near financial disaster. This hardship falls especially\nI\nupon those counties with high levels of unemployment, a high level of government services and\ndisproportionate levels of crime. Often those three attributes go hand in hand.\nI\nII!. ONLY AN ORDER OF THIS COURT WILL ENSURE THAT THE\nCOURT SYSTEM IS BALANCED, AND THAT ITS INTEGRITY IS A\nI\nLIVING, WORKING REALITY.\nThe Courts of Mississippi fulfill many rolls and duties. They mete out justice for the\nI\npoor and rich alike. They solve problems, and they protect society. They send a message of\nI\ngovernmental fairness and equality under the law, and they are often the meeting place of\ncitizens from around Mississippi to convene and engage in the important work of society.\nI\nThis Court has held that it has the inherent authority to order the Legislature to cure its\nI\n\"failure to allocate sufficient funds\" for the Judicial branch. Quitman v. State, 807 So. 2d 401\n(2001). Thus, in 1912, this Court said that \"It]he inherent powers of a court are such as result\nI\nfrom the very nature of its organization, and are essential to its existence and protection, and to\nI\nthe due administration of justice.\" Fuller v. State, 57 So.2d 806, 807 (Miss. 1912) (citing\nWatson v. Williams, 36 Miss. 331 (Miss. Err. App. 1850)).\" This Court also explained in\nI\nHosford v. State, 525 So. 2d 789 (Miss. 1988), that this inherent authority is essential to the\nI\nseparation of powers at the heart of Mississippi's constitutional structure:\nThe same Constitutional requirement for our courts to exist\nI\nobviously carries with it the duty on the part of the legislative\nbranch to provide sufficient funds and facilities for them to operate\nindependently and effectively. Any holding otherwise would\nI emasculate the constitutional mandate for three separate and co-\nequal branches of government by reducing courts to supplicants\nonly of the Legislature.\nI\nThis discretionary authority of the Legislature is wide indeed, but\nit does not cover quite all the spectrum. If it fails to fulfill a\nI constitutional obligation to enable the judicial branch to operate\n5\n\nI\nI\nindependently and effectively, then it has violated its\nI Constitutional mandate, and the Judicial branch has the authority\nas well as the duty to see that courts do not atrophy. No court\ncreated by the Constitution is required to accept conditions which\nI prevent it operating independently and effectively. Such court also\nhas the duty under our governmental system to protect its own\nintegrity. It likewise has the inherent authority as part of a separate\nI and co-equal branch to make such orders to insure that\nindependence and integrity.\n/d. at 797-98 (emphasis added.). _\nI\nFinally, in Quitman v State, 807 So. 2d 401 (2001), this Court reaffirmed and made clear\nI\nthat the provision of criminal justice to all men, irrespective of race, creed, color, or ability to\npay, is a critical aspect of the Judiciary's inherent authority to fulfill its constitutional mandate:\nI\nThe question raised by the County's allegations is whether,\nassuming the State has failed in its duty to provide effective\nI\nindigent defense, the county-based system has resulted in the\ninability of the judiciary to operate in an independent and effective\nmanner to the extent that this Court must, of necessity, interfere in\nI\nthis traditionally legislative function and order the Legislature to\nestablish a statewide, state-fimded system of indigent criminal\ndefense.\nI\nQuitman, 807 So. 2d at 410 (emphasis added).\nI\nMoreover, the Court in Quitman firmly rejected the State's argument that funding was the\nLegislature's sole prerogative:\nI\nThe State argues that the financing of public defenders is a\nlegislative matter for which the courts can provide no remedy. The\nI\nState asserts that because there exists no constitutional restriction\non the ability of the State to allocate the costs of indigent defense\nbetween the State and counties, the system of indigent defense is a\nI\npublic policy decision solely within the purview of the\nLegislature ....\nI\nAs a result, if the \"Legislative branch fails inits constitutional mandate to furnish the absolute\nessentials required for the operation of an independent and effective court, then nocourt affected thereby\nI\nshould fail to act,\" and characterized their powers in such circumstances as an \"absolute duty [] to act\"\nand \"act promptly.\" ld. See also, Wilson v. State, 574 So. 2d at 1341 (\"Since the state funds the\nprosecution inthese cases, why not the defense?\").\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nThough questions of this nature are traditionally legislative affairs,\nI this Court has recognized that where the Legislature fails to act, the\ncourts have the authority and the duty to intervene. This Court\naddressed the Legislature's failure to allocate sufficient funds for\ni the courts to operate in Hosford v. State, 525 So. 2d 789 (Miss.\n1988). In Hosford. poor courtroom conditions including loud\nnoises and poor temperature control led the circuit court to petition\nthis Court for assistance so that the county courthouse would have\nI\nadequate operating facilities .... Certainly, if adequate facilities\nare essential to the administration of justice, so is effective\nrepresentation.\nI\nIn short, this Court's authority is crystal clear. This Court has the power and duty to\nI\nintervene to protect the court system, and, from the perspective of Amici, Mississippi Chancery\nand Circuit Court Clerks', the time for such intervention has arrived.\nI\nCONCLUSION\nI\nAmici Chancery and Circuit Court Clerks' Associations of Mississippi hereby request that\nthe Court rule in favor of Quitman County's request for a statewide, state-funded indigent\nI\ndefense system.\nI\nDated: July 26, 2004\nRespectfully submitted,\nI\nI\nWilliam B.

The Mississippi Association of Supervisors, Mr. Jack Gregory, Executive Director,\nI 793 North President Street, Jackson, Mississippi 39201.\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI iii\n\nI\nI\nINTRODUCTION\nI\nThe Mississippi Association of Supervisors, Inc. (\"MAS\") submits this amicus curiae\nbrief in support of Appellant, Quitman County, Mississippi's (\"Quitman County\") position.\nI\nMAS is a statewide organization comprised of supervisors elected from all 82 Mississippi\n| counties and maintains an active interest in county governments and the citizens which they\nI govern. In working to foster better government for all Mississippi counties, MAS serves as a\nliaison between the counties and the State government, particularly the Mississippi Legislature.\nI\nIt is through this role that MAS has a keen appreciation for the issues posed to the Legislature\nI and this Court in ensuring that adequate, effective assistance of counsel as required by the United\nStates and Mississippi constitutions is received by every indigent defendant in criminal\nI\nproceedings.\nI MAS is sensitive to the serious financial constraints facing our State and appreciates the\nefforts made by the State's legislative and executive branches to limit financial burdens placed\nI\nupon county governments. MAS is aware that a solution to such a difficult issue is not arrived at\nI\neasily but only after careful consideration of the parties' interests, the historical and current facts,\nand, most importantly, the constitutional requirements with which the State is charged. In\nI\nsubmitting this brief, MAS hopes to advance the decision-making process in which this Court is\nI\nengaged. All 82 county members of MAS will be directly impacted by this Court's ruling and,\ntherefore, MAS seeks to ensure that this Court is aware of all relevant facts and law.\nI\nARGUMENT\nI\nA. Mississippi counties cannot sustain the terrible financial burden of a\nconstitutionally effective system of indigent defense\nI\nIt is beyond dispute that indigent defendants in criminal actions are guaranteed the\nfundamental right to effective assistance of counsel under both the United States and Mississippi\nI\nI\n\nconstitutions.6thAmend.,U.S.Const;Art. 3,§26,Miss.Const.;ITriplett v. State, 666 So. 2d\n1356, 1358 (Miss. 1995) (concluding that Mississippi Constitution encompasses all fights to\ncounsel as provided in federal constitution). Furthermore, case law is unequivocal that the\nobligation to provide effective assistance of counsel in criminal proceedings under the Sixth\nAmendment is incumbent upon the State by the Fourteenth Amendment. 2 Gideon v.\nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335,341-42 (1963); Tfiolett, 666 So. 2d at 1357. The question posed to\nthis Court in the case subjudice, however, is whether the State may delegate its constitutional\nobligation of indigent defense andfitnding of that system of indigent defense to financially\nstrapped counties when the existing county-based system results in an inadequate system of\nindigent defense.\nMississippi counties are ill-prepared and financially unable to provide adequate funding\nfor an effective system of indigent defense. County treasuries across Mississippi are limited and\ninadequate to pay for significant expenditures which would be required to provide sufficient\nresources for adequate defense. Insufficient funding of defense services denies lawyers who\nrepresent indigent defendants the time and resources to provide competent representation.\nEffective assistance of counsel is not necessarily limited to fees incurred by defense counsel but\n\"'In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have a right to be heard by\nhimself or counsel, or both .... \" Art. 3, § 26, Miss. Const.\n2 In Gideon_n, the United States Supreme Court held:\n[R]eason and reflection require us to recognize that in our\nadversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court,\nwho is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial\nunless counsel is provided for him. This seems to be an obvious\ntruth .... The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not\nbe deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some\ncountries, but it is in ours.\"\n372 U.S. 335,346 (1963).\n\nI\nI\nalso expert witness assistance and investigation costs. Jackson v. State, 732 So. 2d 187, 188-189\nI\n(Miss. 1999). The payment of these expenses and fees would only be possible at the significant\nsacrifice of county resources devoted to other areas for which the county is responsible such as\nI\neducation, public safety, and public works. As this Court is aware, these traditional obligations\nI\nof the county are currently under tremendous budgetary constraints without the added financial\nI pressure of paying for the legal representation of indigent defendants. The unfunded mandate\nthrough which the State is attempting to transfer its constitutional duties would literally break the\nI\ncoffers of many Mississippi counties.\nI An evenmore devastating, but perhaps more realistic, result of the unfunded mandate\nwould be that legal counsel provided by the county would not be effective. See Tri1.ple_tt_6,66 So.\nI\n2d at 1357 (finding that Sixth Amendment right to counsel means \"the right to effective\nI assistance of counsel\") (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n. 14 (1970)). If the\ncounty is forced to provide legal representation in the face of existing financial trouble, it\nI\nlogically would seek the least expensive counsel and provide the minimal resources while hoping\nI\nthat it is effective under Gideon and its progeny. As a result, the indigent defendants are unable\nto vindicate their constitutional rights to investigative, expert or other services necessary for an\nI\nadequate defense. Furthermore, the right to effective assistance of counsel is more vulnerable\nI\nwhen the burden of providing it is passed to 82 separate county governments, instead of being\nfunded and administered by the State. See, e.__., State Tax Comm'n v. Fondren, 387 So. 2d 712,\nI\n719-20 (Miss. 1980) (requiring State Tax Commission to equalize assessments of ad valorem\nI\ntaxes among counties where practically each county maintained differing standards of.\nassessment). As there would be no uniformity in providing defense counsel to criminally\nI\naccused indigents, the inherent constitutional tightrope created by the unfunded mandate\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nvirtually ensures that their fights would be violated. The State's attempted delegation of its\nI\nconstitutional obligation would defeat the very purpose which it purports to obtain, i.e., securing\nI the right of effective assistance of counsel to every indigent defendant in criminal proceedings.\nB. Mississippi's existing county-based system fails to provide indigent defendants\nI with the tools of an adequate defense\nFundamental fairness entitles indigent defendants to \"an adequate opportunity to present\nI\ntheir claims fairly within the adversary system.\" Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 612 (1974). In\nI implementing this principle, the Supreme Court has focused on identifying the \"basic tools of an\nadequate defense or appeal.\" Britt v. North Carolina, 404 U. S. 226, 227 (1971). A criminal trial\nI\nis fundamentally unfair if the State proceeds against an indigent defendant without making\nI certain that he has access to the raw materials integral to the building of an effective defense.\nHarrison v. State, 635 So.2d 894, 901 (Miss. 1994).\nI\nThe chronic underfunding of Mississippi's existing county-based system adversely\nI affects the administration of an adequate defense. Indigent defendants are entitled to the basic\ntools of an adequate defense, other than mere counsel at the county's expense, as a necessary\nI\ncorollary to the right to counsel. The right of counsel means the right to effective assistance of\nI counsel, which allows for the opportunity to investigative, consult with experts or utilize other\nservices necessary in proving the facts of their case where such opportunity is appropriate. In\nI\nMississippi, however, these services necessary to an adequate defense are often limited to the\nI\nspan of one day. In many cases, public defenders are often appointed to represent indigent\ndefendants at the arraignment, and then a guilty plea is entered on the same day. This type of\nI\npractice abuses the basic tools of attorney/client contact, fact investigation and motion practice,\nI\nwhich are essential to building an adequate defense in any case. The Supreme Court warned that\nthe \"denial of opportunity for appointed counsel to confer, to consult with the accused and to\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nprepare his defense, could convert the appointment of counsel into a sham and nothing more than\na formal compliance with the Constitution's requirement that an accused be given the assistance\ni\nof counsel.\" Avery v. Alabama, 308 U. S. 444, 446 (1940). Furthermore, this type of practice\nI\nprohibits counsel from securing the necessary information on which to construct a defense. To\nI\nconstruct an adequate defense, counsel should have the opportunity to interview material\nI witnesses, view the scene of the alleged crime and consult wit experts where such opportunity is\nappropriate.\nI\nThe existing county-based system in Mississippi lacks the raw materials essential to the\ni building of an effective defense. As a result, indigent defendants are unable to vindicate their\nconstitutional right of effective assistance of counsel.\nI\nCONCLUSION\nI, The State of Mississippi is required to provide effective assistance of counsel to indigent\ndefendants in criminal proceedings and stands in better financial condition to execute its\nI\nconstitutional charge. Counties are not able to bear the financial burden nor to uniformly apply\nI the State's constitutional obligation. Accordingly, the Mississippi Association of Supervisors,\nInc. respectfully requests this Court to reverse the decision of the Circuit Court and require\nI\nimplementation of a statewide, state-fimded indigent defense system.\nI RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, this the _]_day of July, 2004.\nMISSISSIPPI ASSOCIATION OF SUPERVISORS, INC.\nI\n_y:___ e_a.+\nI\nElizabeth Lambert (MB #101187)\nTommie S.
