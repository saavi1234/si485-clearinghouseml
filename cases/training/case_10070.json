    "summary": "<p>On 10/24/1986, a group of criminal defense attorneys and indigent criminal defendants filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action lawsuit against Georgia state officials (including the governor and all state court judges responsible for appointing attorneys to indigent criminal defendants) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The plaintiffs claimed that a number of inadequacies in Georgia's indigent criminal defense system (including inadequate resources, delays in the appointment of counsel, pressure on attorneys to hurry their clients' case to trial or to enter a guilty plea, and inadequate supervision) deprived indigent criminal defendants of their rights to counsel, due process, and equal protection.  Plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, the Georgia Law Center for the Homeless, and private counsel, sought injunctive relief to remedy the alleged deficiencies. </p><p>On June 24, 1987 and December 31, 1988, the District Court (Judge Harold L. Murphy) granted Defendants' motion to dismiss on two alternate grounds.  First, the District Court reasoned that, while individual state officials had been the nominal defendants, the suit was, in essence, brought against the State of Georgia and was therefore barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  Second, the District Court held that, independent of the Eleventh Amendment rationale, the suit ought to be dismissed because Plaintiffs' complaint failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted.  Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</p><p>On November 23, 1988, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit (Judge Robert Smith Vance) reversed, rejecting both grounds for the District Court's dismissal.  Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 (11th Cir. 1988).  The Court first held that the suit was not barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity because, under the Ex Parte Young exception to the Eleventh Amendment, a suit seeking prospective relief against state officials is not deemed to be a suit against the state.  The Eleventh Circuit also rejected the second ground for the District Court's dismissal, holding that Plaintiffs' complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted despite the fact that it did not allege the \"future inevitability of ineffective assistance.\"  The Court thereby reversed the dismissal and remanded to the District Court.</p><p>The defendants were unsuccessful in their attempts to have the Eleventh Circuit panel's decision overturned.  On December 29, 1989, the Eleventh Circuit, in a per curiam decision, denied Defendants' petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc, Luckey v. Harris, 896 F.2d 479 (11th Cir. 1989), and, on May 29, 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari, Luckey v. Harris, 495 U.S. 957 (1989).</p><p>Upon remand to the District Court, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss the case on the basis of the abstention doctrine as set forth in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  On July 10, 1990 the District Court denied the renewed motion to dismiss, holding that it was bound by the law of the case.  The District Court reasoned that, while the Eleventh Circuit had not explicitly ruled on the abstention issue, it had sent the clear message that the case should be heard.  The District Court nevertheless certified the issue for immediate appeal.  The Eleventh Circuit (Judge Stanley F. Birch, Jr.) agreed to hear the case, Luckey v. Miller, 918 F.2d 888 (11th Cir. 1991), and, on April 23, 1991, the Eleventh Circuit (Judge Joel Fredrick Dubina) reversed on the law of the case issue, Luckey v. Miller, 929 F.2d 618 (11th Cir. 1991).  The case was again remanded.</p><p>On remand, the District Court (Judge Murphy) considered Defendants' abstention argument and, on that ground, dismissed the case on December 16, 1991.  The dismissal was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit on November 4, 1992.  Luckey v. Miller, 976 F.2d 673 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam).</p><p>According to the PACER docket, no further appeals were taken and the case was closed.</p><p></p>",

As this Court finds the Defendant's Motion\nto Dismiss should be granted, the Court does not reach the issues presented in Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary\nInjunction.\n\nA. Procedural History\nThis case has, thus far, been the subject of four decisions by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The first\n675 decision, Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 (11th Cir. *675 1988), (\"Luckey I\") reversed this Court's grant of the\nDefendant's initial motion to dismiss. The Appellate Court held that Plaintiffs' Complaint did state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted and that it was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The Appellate Court did not\naddress Defendant's abstention arguments.\nAbstention was addressed, albeit in a dissenting opinion, in the second Appellate Court opinion in this case. See,\nLuckey v. Harris, 896 F.2d 479 (11th Cir.1989) (\"Luckey II\"). In Luckey II the Appellate Court denied a motion to\nrehear the case, and also denied a motion to hear the case en banc. The majority of the court did not issue an\nopinion. Four judges, however, dissented from the majorities' decision in an opinion written by Judge\nEdmondson. Judge Edmondson's opinion, joined by Judges Fay and Cox and Chief Judge Tjoflat, concluded that\ndismissal of this case was required under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 [91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669] (1971),\nand O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488 [94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674] (1974), lest Georgia's state courts be\nplaced, potentially, under the direct supervision of this Court.\nOn remand from the Circuit's second opinion in this case, this Court concluded that Defendant's renewed motion\nto dismiss must denied under the law of the case doctrine. This Court reasoned that:\n\"by soundly reversing this Court, denying rehearing, denying rehearing en banc in the face of\nJudge Edmondson's dissent, and denying Defendant's Motion to Stay the Mandate pending the\nSupreme Court's disposition of Defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari, the Eleventh Circuit\ngave this Court the clear message that this case should be heard.\"\nOrder of the Court dated July 10, 1990, at 11. This Court also made clear, however, that had it not considered\nitself bound by the law of the case, it would have abstained from the hearing the case. Id. Lastly this Court\ncertified its disposition of the case for immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\nThe Appellate Court's third opinion in this case upheld this Court's grant of appellate certification. See, Harris v.\nLuckey, 918 F.2d 888 (11th Cir.1990) (\"Luckey III\"). The Court pointed out that an immediate appeal was\nappropriate in light of the fact that \"there are substantial grounds for [the defendant's] contention that the district\ncourt was not bound by the law of the case to reject the abstention doctrine of Younger.\" Id.,918 F.2d, at 893.\nAn immediate appeal was had and the Appellate Court reversed this Court for the second time. See, Luckey v.\nMiller, 929 F.2d 618 (1991) (\"Luckey IV\"). In its fourth opinion in the instant case, the Appellate Court held that the\nlaw of the case doctrine did not preclude consideration of the abstention doctrine since it was unclear whether\nsuch arguments had been previously considered. The Appellate Court found first that the arguments in favor of\nabstention were not raised by the Defendants prior to the Circuit's opinion in Luckey I, and were not addressed\nby the Appellate Court for that reason. Second, the Court found that since the Appellate Court's second opinion, \nLuckey II, denied en banc review without specifying any reasons for that denial, whether the Court had\nconsidered the abstention arguments raised by Judge Edmondson in his dissent could not be determined. The\nAppellate Court in Luckey IV concluded, therefore, that the law of the case doctrine did not bar consideration of\n[1]\nthe abstention doctrine and the case was remanded in order that such arguments could be considered.\n676  B. Plaintiff's Complaint\n*676\nPlaintiffs' Complaint asserts a class action on behalf of \"all individuals who are or will in the future be adversely\naffected by the unconstitutional practices of the indigent defense system within Georgia.\" They claim that\nGeorgia's indigent defense system \"is inherently incapable of providing constitutionally adequate services,\" and\nthat the system therefore \"violates the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\" Plaintiff's seek the following relief:\n(1) a court order providing for an indigent defense system that;\n\n(a) furnishes counsel, if requested, at probable cause determinations,\n(b) furnishes speedy appointment of counsel for critical stages,\n(c) furnishes adequate services and experts, and\n(d) furnishes adequate compensation for counsel\n(2) a court order that \"uniform standards be promulgated and adopted governing the\nrepresentation of indigent consistent with the judgment in this case;\"\n(3) monitor the implementation of those standards; and\n(4) award attorney's fees and other proper relief.\nPlaintiff's complaint has been upheld in the face of challenges based on Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and the Eleventh\nAmendment. As pointed out above, this complaint now faces a challenge based on the abstention doctrine of \nYounger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 [91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669] (1971).\nC. Abstention\nIn Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 [91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669] (1971), the United States Supreme Court found\nthat a \"basic doctrine of equity jurisprudence [is] that courts of equity should not act, and particularly should not\nact to restrain a criminal prosecution, when the moving party has an adequate remedy at law and will not suffer\nirreparable injury if denied equitable relief.\" Id., at 43-44 [97 S.Ct. at 750]; See, 28 U.S.C. § 2283. The Court\nexplained that abstention from interference in state criminal proceedings served the vital consideration of comity\nbetween the state and national governments.\n\"The concept does not mean blind deference to `State's Rights' any more than it means\ncentralization of control over every important issue in our National Government and its courts. The\nFramers rejected both these courses. What the concept does represent is a system in which there\nis sensitivity to the legitimate interests of both State and National Governments, and in which the\nNational Government, anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal\ninterests, always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate\nactivities of the states.\"\nId., at 44 [91 S.Ct. at 750-51].\nThe doctrine was further elaborated upon in O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488 [94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674]\n(1974). In O'Shea the plaintiffs sought an injunction aimed at controlling or preventing the occurrence of specific\nevents that might take place in the course of future criminal trials. The Court held that;\n\"a federal court should not intervene to establish the basis for future intervention that would be so\nintrusive and unworkable.... The objection is to unwarranted anticipatory interference in the state\ncriminal process by means of continuous or piecemeal interruptions of the state proceedings by\nlitigation in the federal courts; the object is to sustain `[t]he special delicacy of the adjustment to be\npreserved between federal equitable power and State administration of its own law.\"\nId., at 500 [94 S.Ct. at 678], quoting, Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U.S. 117, 120 [72 S.Ct. 118, 120, 96 L.Ed. 138]\n(1951).\nIn Luckey II, Judge Edmondson found that the Supreme Court's decision in O'Shea mandated a dismissal of the\n677 instant complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). *677 His dissent, joined by three other judges, also found that\nunder binding Eleventh Circuit authority, the Plaintiff's complaint should be dismissed on abstention grounds. \nSee, Luckey II, 896 F.2d, at 481-82; See also, Gardner v. Luckey, 500 F.2d 712 (5th Cir.1974); Tarter v. Hury, 646\nF.2d 1010 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981). Likewise in its order dated July 10, 1990, this Court made it clear that had it not\n\nconsidered itself bound by the law of the case doctrine this Court would have dismissed the present action under \nO'Shea and other Eleventh Circuit authority. See, order dated July 10, 1990, at 11.\nThe Appellate Court's opinion in Luckey IV impacted this Court's analysis of the pending motion to dismiss in two\nways. First, the opinion clearly indicated that the Circuit's previous opinions had not passed on the merits of the\n[2]\nDefendant's abstention defense. Luckey IV, 929 F.2d, at 622. Second, the opinion in Luckey IV made it clear\nthat the law of the case doctrine was no bar to dismissal under the abstention doctrine. See, Luckey IV, 929 F.2d,\nat 623. Consequently, given that this Court has already expressed its view of the pending motion, and that the\nobstacles this Court considered to prevent an implementation of that view have been removed, the Plaintiffs'\nburden in opposing the pending motion is, basically, to convince this Court that it should change its view. The\nPlaintiffs have failed to do so.\nPlaintiffs' first argument against dismissal of this action is that Younger is no bar to all federal injunctive relief\neven if the same subject is actually, rather than potentially, in state court litigation. Plaintiffs' contend that they do\nnot seek to contest any criminal conviction, nor to restrain any criminal prosecution, and that they seek only to\nhave this Court consider systemic issues which cannot be raised in any individual case. Plaintiffs argue that \nYounger only bars federal courts from restraining ongoing state court prosecutions and does not bar the\nprospective relief they seek.\nPlaintiffs' legal authority for this position is tenuous. The two district court opinions upon which rely, Westin v.\nMcDaniel, 760 F.Supp. 1563 (M.D.Ga.1991) and R.C. v. Hornsby, no. 88-d-1170-n, M.D.Ala. April 19, 1989, are\ndistinguishable on their facts. In Westin, for example, the Court ruled on alternative grounds that: (1) there were\nno state court action pending, and (2) even if there was, the claim would fall within the bad faith exception to the \nYounger abstention doctrine. See Westin, 760 F.Supp., at 1568, 1572. R.C. v. Hornsby, supra, is also\ndistinguishable. In R.C., a case in which the plaintiff sought to alleviate systemic constitutional deprivations in the\nfoster care system for emotionally disturbed children, the Court expressly found that there was no state court\nproceedings which would be interfered with, and that the state's juvenile courts lacked authority to consider the\nissues raised by the complaint. In the instant case, however, a decree of the sort requested by the plaintiffs\n[3]\nwould, inevitably, interfere with every state criminal proceeding.  Moreover, in the instant case, the state courts\ndo have the authority to consider the claims raised by the plaintiffs. See, Luckey II, (Edmondson dissenting), 896\nF.2d, at 482.\nMoreover this Court cannot concur in the Plaintiff's characterization of their claims. Although it is true that\nPlaintiffs do not seek to contest any single criminal conviction nor restrain any individual prosecution, it is\nnonetheless clear that plaintiff's intend to restrain every indigent prosecution and contest every indigent\nconviction until the systemic improvements they seek are in place. The fact no individual case is contested\n678 functions only to set up an empty *678 syllogism by which plaintiffs may argue that their intent is not to interfere\nwith pending prosecutions.\nIn any case, the thrust of Judge Edmondson's opinion, as well as this Court's previous decision, was on the\nanalysis provided by the Supreme Court in O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488 [94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674]\n(1974). This Court was specifically concerned with the prospective effect of the decree sought by the plaintiffs. As\nthis Court pointed out:\n\"[t]he relief sought by the plaintiffs would require this Court to force the state to promulgate\nuniform standards relating to various stages of prosecutions and also to monitor those standards.\nIf the monitoring is to be effective, this Court will have to review ongoing state proceedings and\nmay have to interrupt them if the standards are not being followed. Even if the Court merely\nrequired periodic reporting, such action on the part of a federal court strikes at the heart of the\nprohibitions that are embedded into constitutional law by Younger and its progeny. See, O'Shea,\n414 U.S., at 501 [94 S.Ct. at 679] (periodic reporting \"would constitute a form of monitoring of the\noperation of state court functions that is antipathetic to established principles of comity\").\"\nSee, Order dated July 10, 1990, at 10.\n\nPlaintiffs do not shrink from the task of attempting to distinguish their claims from those before the Court in \nO'Shea. Plaintiffs point out that in O'Shea any court order implementing the relief requested would have\nnecessarily involved constant outside supervision. Plaintiffs contend that in the instant case they seek merely an\norder which would require the Defendants to reform their own system, and not to impose ongoing review from the\noutside.\nPlaintiffs bolster this argument by presenting a number of possible solutions to the problem of creating a remedy,\ninoffensive to the comity concerns of Younger and O'Shea, should liability be found. First, a reporting\nrequirement, if required would not be unduly burdensome in light of the fact that Georgia has already instituted a\n[4]\nsystem of reporting as a precondition to state grants.  Second, any relief against the Defendant Governor would\nnot impact the concerns expressed in Younger and O'Shea since the onus would be on the state executive rather\n[5]\nthan the judiciary to comply. Third, any other relief would not require intervention in ongoing prosecutions.\nEquitable relief such as a declaratory judgment could be imposed and the state Defendants left to their own\nresources in formulating a means for compliance. Likewise, a simple \"best efforts\" decree would leave the\n[6]\nDefendants similar autonomy in fashioning their means of compliance.\nPlaintiffs conclude that since this Court would have a host of remedies which would not offend O'Shea by\nestablishing the basis for future intervention in Georgia's criminal justice system, the bar of O'Shea does not\napply. See, Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 [95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54] (1975); Tucker v. City of Montgomery\nBoard of Commissioners, 410 F.Supp. 494 (M.D.Ala. 1976).\n679 *679 This Court is unable to agree with the Plaintiffs' argument because, in the view of this Court, even the\nlimited decrees set forth above would inevitably set up the precise basis for future intervention condemned in \nO'Shea. Such a case cannot be decided in a vacuum, and the potential enforcement difficulties of any order\nreforming such an integral aspect of a state criminal justice process as the indigent defense system would be\nsignificant.\nPlaintiffs contend that the Court should not anticipate, at this stage of the litigation, that it would be forced to enter\nrelief which would offend the principles set forth in O'Shea. They point out that the Defendants, in effect, ask this\nCourt to assume in advance that they will flout any order which the Court may issue. Plaintiffs argue that such\nhypothesized recalcitrance cannot defeat Plaintiff's claim for relief. In the view of this Court, however,\nhypothesized recalcitrance is the precise inquiry demanded by O'Shea. As the Court in O'Shea explained,\n\"the question arises of how compliance might be enforced if the beneficiaries of the injunction\nwere to charge that it had been disobeyed. Presumably any member of respondent's class who\nappeared as an accused before petitioners could allege and have adjudicated a claim that\npetitioner's were in contempt of the federal court's injunction order, with a review of an adverse\ndecision in the Court of Appeals and, perhaps in this court.\"\nO'Shea, 414 U.S., at 501-02 [94 S.Ct. at 679]. Likewise in his dissent Judge Edmondson noted,\n\"If a state court judge does not obey a district court's injunction, are we willing to jail the state court\njudge for contempt? Avoidance of this unseemly conflict between state and federal judges is one\nreason for O'Shea and Younger.\nLuckey II, 896 F.2d, at 482. This Court is constrained, therefore, to focus on the likely result of an attempt to\nenforce an order of the nature sought here. It would certainly create an awkward moment if, at the end of\nprotracted litigation, a compliance problem arose which would force abstention on the same ground that existed\nprior to trial.\nPlaintiffs argue, finally, that even if the entry of a declaratory judgment or best efforts decree should lay the\ngroundwork for a future request for more detailed relief, that abstract possibility is insufficient to require this Court\nto deny all relief. Again, this Court must disagree. In the view of this Court, laying the groundwork for a future\nrequest for more detailed relief which would violate the comity principles expressed in Younger and O'Shea is the\nprecise exercise forbidden under the abstention doctrine. O'Shea, 414 U.S., at 500 [94 S.Ct. at 678].\n\nAlthough the Court admires the efforts put forth by the Plaintiffs in an attempt to distinguish their claims from\nthose in O'Shea, this Court cannot concur in their conclusions. Consequently the view of the law expressed by\nthis Court in its order dated July 10, 1990, remains this Court's view of the law today. This Court does not believe\nthat it should exercise its equitable jurisdiction to hear this case.\nAccordingly, based on the above, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 16th day of December 1991.\n/s/ Harold L. Murphy UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n[1] An analysis of the Circuit's handling of this case might indicate that the Circuit has determined that this Court\nshould simply enter an order dismissing this case under the abstention doctrine. Four judges have clearly stated\nthat this would be their conclusion. Moreover, in its last order this Court clearly indicated its intention to dismiss\nthis action on abstention grounds had it not considered itself bound by the law of the case. The Circuit has now\nremoved the obstacle of the law of the case without comment as to this Court's alternative holding. An argument\nexists, therefore, that the Circuit approves of this Court's alternate holding since the Circuit did nothing to\ndissuade this Court from its clearly expressed course.\n[2] Consequently, by this Court's count, there are four Circuit Court Judges who have accepted the Defendant's\nargument, and none who explicitly reject it.\n[3] Plaintiffs admit, by implication, that every criminal prosecution of an indigent person in Georgia would be\nrestrained, potentially, by a finding of liability in this case. Plaintiff's argue that no such order is necessarily\nrequired, \"unless Defendants defaulted in meeting Constitutional requirements....\" Plaintiff's Supplemental Brief\nOpposing Dismissal, page 17.\n[4] Plaintiffs contend that since such reports, at least in some form, are being made, any Court order would not\nneed to require them to be made. Moreover, since the reports are made by state court administrators, any\nreporting order would not need to be directed at the judicial officer. In the view of this Court, however, the degree\nof burden imposed by such a requirement is only one factor underlying the concept of comity. The real question is\nwhether the Court should force such reports to be made, not how difficult it would be to make them.\n[5] Plaintiffs contend that all relief other than a reporting requirement would not be offensive to the comity\nconcerns of Younger and its progeny.\n[6] Plaintiffs contend, basically, that leaving the means of compliance to the state's initiative would avoid any\ncomity problems with entering a finding of liability. Plaintiffs point out that any stronger action would not be\nnecessary unless the Defendants failed to take appropriate action. As explained infra, however, this Court does\nnot believe that it can extricate itself from the problems of enforcing a decree of the nature sought so easily.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Hill, Jr., Michael E. Hobbs, Alfred L. Evans, Jr., Atlanta, Ga., for defendants-appellants.\nDavid A. Webster, Emory University School of Law, Robert B. Remar, Megan E. Gideon, Eric G. Kocher, Kocher\nWilson Korschun & Cobb, Neil Bradley, Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiffs-appellees.\nBefore HATCHETT and DUBINA, Circuit Judges, and HILL, Senior Circuit Judge.\nDUBINA, Circuit Judge:\nHorace Luckey III and the other appellees herein seek intervention by the federal courts regarding the indigent\ncriminal defense system of the Georgia state courts. This court has permitted the appellants in this case to\nappeal an interlocutory order of the district court denying renewed motions to dismiss the complaint. The district\ncourt declined to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the law of the case barred it from considering the\nappellants' asserted grounds for dismissal. For the reasons which follow, we vacate the district court's order and\nremand the case for reconsideration by the district court of the appellants' renewed motions to dismiss.\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nThe appellees in this case (\"the Luckey plaintiffs\") represent a bilateral class consisting of (1) all indigent persons\npresently charged or who will be charged in the future with criminal offenses in the state courts of Georgia and (2)\nall attorneys who represent or will represent indigent defendants in the Georgia state courts. The appellants in\nthis case are Zell Miller, the Governor of the State of Georgia; the Honorable Robert J. Noland, Chief Judge of\nthe Douglas Judicial Circuit; the Honorable Joe E. Crumbley, Chief Judge of the Clayton Judicial Circuit; and all\nother Georgia state court judges who are responsible for appointing attorneys or otherwise arranging for the\nassistance of counsel for indigent criminal defendants in the Georgia state court system (\"the Miller defendants\").\nThe Luckey plaintiffs allege that systemic deficiencies in the Georgia indigent criminal defense system deny\nindigent criminal defendants their sixth amendment right to counsel, their due process rights under the fourteenth\namendment, their right to bail under the eighth and fourteenth amendments, and equal protection of the laws\n[1]\nguaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.  They seek federal intervention in order to establish minimum\nconstitutional standards for the provision of indigent criminal defense services in the state courts of Georgia and\nto enforce adherence by the Miller defendants to those standards.\nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThe Luckey plaintiffs brought this action in October 1986 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Miller defendants\nresponded with motions to dismiss asserting the following grounds: (1) immunity under the eleventh amendment;\n(2) no Article III case or controversy; (3) lack of the requisite degree of substantiality of the federal question; and\n(4) failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted. The district court dismissed the case in June 1987 on\n620 the ground *620 that the complaint, while nominally against the Governor and state court judges, was in essence\na suit against the State of Georgia and therefore was barred by the eleventh amendment. The Luckey plaintiffs\nfiled a motion to reconsider, which was granted. The court again dismissed the case in December 1987,\n\nconcluding that, even if the eleventh amendment were no bar to the action, the complaint failed to state a claim\nfor which relief could be granted. The Luckey plaintiffs appealed the order of dismissal.\nA panel of this court reversed the district court in Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 (11th Cir.1988) (\"Luckey I\"). \n[2]\nLuckey I held: (1) that the relief sought by the Luckey plaintiffs fell within the Ex parte Young  exception to the\neleventh amendment's general prohibition of suits brought against a state by its own citizens; (2) that personal\naction by state officials was not a necessary condition of injunctive relief as long as they were responsible for the\nchallenged action; (3) that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to establish the necessary \"case or\ncontroversy\" requirement; and (4) that in order to obtain prospective injunctive relief to compel state officials to\nfurnish adequate legal representation to indigents, the Luckey plaintiffs were only required to show the likelihood\nof substantial and immediate irreparable injury and inadequacy of their remedies at law, not the \"future\ninevitability of ineffective assistance\" required by the district court.\nThe Miller defendants filed a suggestion of rehearing en banc in December 1988. Thereafter, a poll was\nconducted pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 35 and 11th Cir.R. 35. The petition for rehearing en banc was denied in\nDecember 1989. Luckey v. Harris, 896 F.2d 479 (11th Cir.1989) (per curiam), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 110\nS.Ct. 2562, 109 L.Ed.2d 744 (1990) (\"Luckey II\"). A dissenting opinion focused primarily on the abstention\ndoctrine, which the dissent felt should have been considered by the court on its own motion even though it was\nnot asserted expressly. Luckey II, 896 F.2d at 479 (Edmondson, J., dissenting).\nOn remand to the district court, the Miller defendants reasserted their motions to dismiss on nonjusticiability and\nabstention grounds. Their new grounds for dismissal mirrored those outlined in Judge Edmondson's dissent in \nLuckey II. The Luckey plaintiffs argued that the law of the case barred the defendants from raising those grounds.\nThe Miller defendants maintained that, since the question of the applicability of the abstention doctrine had not\nbeen presented to or adjudicated by this court, the law of the case did not control the motions before the district\ncourt. The district court disagreed. In its order denying the Miller defendants' renewed motions to dismiss, the\ndistrict court first thoroughly considered the abstention issue, and opined that the Miller defendants' motions were\nmeritorious based on considerations of comity, equity, and federalism. The district court concluded, nevertheless,\nthat it was constrained by the law of the case, and declined to dismiss the complaint. The district court then\ncertified its interlocutory order for appeal.\nThe Miller defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) and\nFed.R.App.P. 5, which was granted by a divided panel. Harris v. Luckey, 918 F.2d 888 (11th Cir.1990) (\"Luckey\nIII\"). The dissent agreed with the Luckey plaintiffs that the law of the case barred dismissal on abstention\ngrounds. Luckey III, 918 F.2d at 894 (Hatchett, J., dissenting).\nIII. DISCUSSION\nThe narrow issue presented by this appeal is whether the law of the case precludes the district court from\n621 considering the jurisdictional dismissal of the complaint in accordance with controlling Supreme *621 Court and\nEleventh Circuit precedent on the applicability of the abstention doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91\nS.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). The district court's legal conclusion is subject to de novo review by this court. \nKirkland v. National Mortgage Network, Inc., 884 F.2d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir.1989).\nThe purpose of the law of the case doctrine is to establish efficiency, finality, and obedience within the judicial\nsystem. Wheeler v. City of Pleasant Grove, 746 F.2d 1437, 1440 (11th Cir.1984). Adherence to the law of the\ncase decrees that the \"findings of fact and conclusions of law by an appellate court are generally binding in all\nsubsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal.\" Heathcoat v. Potts, 905 F.2d\n367, 370 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting Dorsey v. Continental Cas. Co., 730 F.2d 675, 678 (11th Cir.1984)). The\ndoctrine is not as rigid as res judicata, however, and does not bar consideration of matters that could have been,\nbut were not, resolved in earlier proceedings. Litman v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 825 F.2d 1506, 1511\n(11th Cir.1987) (en banc), cert. denied,484 U.S. 1006, 108 S.Ct. 700, 98 L.Ed.2d 652 (1988). While law of the\ncase preclusion is limited to those issues previously decided, the doctrine does operate to encompass issues\ndecided by necessary implication as well as those decided explicitly. Heathcoat, 905 F.2d at 370.\n\nWhen acting under an appellate court's mandate, the law of the case dictates that a district court \"cannot vary it,\nor examine it for any other purpose than execution; or give any other or further relief; or review it, even for\napparent error, upon a matter decided on appeal; or intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much as has\nbeen remanded.\" Litman, 825 F.2d at 1511 (quoting In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., 160 U.S. 247, 255, 16 S.Ct.\n291, 293, 40 L.Ed. 414 (1895)). Even so, the law of the case is not an inexorable command, for the district court\nmay address issues which have not been disposed of on appeal. Piambino v. Bailey, 757 F.2d 1112, 1119 (11th\nCir.1985),cert. denied,476 U.S. 1169, 106 S.Ct. 2889, 90 L.Ed.2d 976 (1986).\nIn its order denying the Miller defendants' motions to dismiss this case on abstention grounds, the district court\ndetermined that, under the law of the case, it was precluded from considering the abstention argument raised by\nthe Miller defendants. The district court concluded that, since the entire Eleventh Circuit was faced with Judge\nEdmondson's arguments regarding abstention in Luckey II and declined to rehear the case or to stay the\nmandate pending the Supreme Court's disposition of the Miller defendants' petition for writ of certiorari, this court\nhad delivered a clear message that this case should be heard. The Luckey plaintiffs agree with that conclusion.\nThe Miller defendants argue that we should reverse the district court and allow it to consider their abstention\narguments. They maintain that the law of the case does not bar consideration of the abstention issue because it\nwas not raised before or considered by the appellate panel. The Miller defendants also point out that the denial of\nrehearing en banc without opinion bears little, if any, precedential weight.\nUnquestionably, abstention was not presented to the panel which heard the initial appeal in this case and was not\nexplicitly addressed in Luckey I. Abstention was never pleaded, briefed, argued, or ruled upon. Our inquiry must\nthen focus upon whether that issue was \"decided by necessary implication\" when this court denied rehearing en\nbanc in Luckey II, notwithstanding the examination of an abstention argument in the dissent. If this court neither\nexplicitly nor implicitly addressed abstention, then the district court is not barred from considering the dismissal of\nthis case on that basis. The law of the case doctrine clearly does not extend to issues an appellate court did not\naddress. Piambino, 757 F.2d at 1120.\nThe Miller defendants rely on the Fifth Circuit's decision in Wilcox v. Miller, 691 F.2d 739 (5th Cir.1982), which\n622 stated that the doctrine of the law of the case did not prevent the dismissal of a complaint where *622 an earlier\npanel had reversed a dismissal on other grounds. 691 F.2d at 740 n. 2. The Luckey plaintiffs insist that, contrary\nto the situation presented in Wilcox, the issue of abstention was raised in this case during the rehearing process,\n[3]\nand has, therefore, been rejected.  In response, the Miller defendants argue that a summary order of denial by\nthis court is equivalent to the denial of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court, which does not constitute\nan opinion on the merits of the case in which the petition is denied. See, e.g., Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World\nAirlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 365 n. 1, 93 S.Ct. 647, 650 n. 1, 34 L.Ed.2d 577 (1973).\nWe cannot conclude that the applicability of abstention was implicitly decided in the prior proceedings in this case\nbefore this court. In our view, a summary denial of rehearing en banc is insufficient to confer any implication or\ninference regarding the court's opinion relative to the merits of a case. The mere presence of an abstention\nargument raised in dissent in Luckey II is simply not enough to imply a preclusive decision.\nWe also believe that attaching precedential weight to a denial of rehearing en banc would be unmanageable. As\nthe majority explained in Luckey III, if the denial of a petition for rehearing en banc established the law of the\ncase, then any judge who disagreed with any part of the panel opinion on which a poll was requested would be\nconstrained to vote in favor of en banc review. Any poll that resulted in the denial of a petition for rehearing en\nbanc would place the authority of the entire court behind not only every express holding in the panel opinion, but\nbehind every conceivable implied holding as well. There is nothing in Luckey II to indicate why the majority of this\ncourt was not persuaded to grant en banc review, and any attempt to attribute any specific reasoning to a\nmember of that majority is purely speculative. The dearth of stated reasons for the denial of en banc review\nunderscores the risk of attributing any meaning to that decision within the context of the law of the case. We are\nconvinced that such a practice would be untenable in light of the extraordinary nature of en banc review by this\n[4]\ncourt. See Luckey III, 918 F.2d at 893-94.\n\nAccordingly, we find no law of the case barrier to the district court's consideration of the abstention doctrine in\ndeciding whether this case should be dismissed.\nThe district court's order denying the Miller defendants' motions to dismiss is hereby VACATED and this cause\nREMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nVACATED and REMANDED.\nHATCHETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nThe majority states that the purpose of the law of the case doctrine \"is to establish efficiency, finality, and\nobedience within the judicial system.\" Majority opinion at page 621. With the filing of the majority opinion in this\ncase, \"efficiency, finality, and obedience within [the Eleventh Circuit]\" become meaningless utterances. According\nto the majority, one judge of the en banc court may (1) dissent from the court's refusal to grant en banc rehearing\n623 on issues *623 decided by the district court and a panel of this court, (2) write on a new self-created theory, not\npleaded, not ruled on, not discussed, and (3) thereby nullify the actions of the parties, the district court, the panel,\nand the en banc court.\nIn the simplest terms, the majority holds that a judge on the en banc court, may not only review the district court's\nrulings and the panel's holdings, but, acting alone, may from the reviewed case give birth to a new case, based\non grounds never thought of by the parties.\nFor the additional reasons stated in my dissent in Harris v. Luckey, 918 F.2d 888 (11th Cir.1990) (Luckey III), I\ncontinue to dissent.\n[1] The alleged deficiencies in the Georgia indigent criminal defense system include inadequate resources,\ndelays in the appointment of counsel, pressure on attorneys to hurry their clients' cases to trial or to enter guilty\npleas, and inadequate supervision.\n[2]Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). This exception has been developed over\nthe years to permit prospective relief against state officers in their official capacities. Courts may order such state\nofficials to refrain from unconstitutional conduct even though compliance may cost the state money. See Milliken\nv. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2761, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977).\n[3] The Luckey plaintiffs maintain that Younger abstention is jurisdictional, thereby conferring upon the initial\npanel the power to consider the abstention issue when it was presented, even though its original decision had\nalready been rendered. Because the panel could not escape ruling on jurisdictional issues, they claim that its\nrejection of the abstention argument is necessarily inferred from its disposition.\n[4] 11th Cir.R. 35-3 (\"Extraordinary Nature of Suggestion of In Banc Consideration\") states as follows: \nA suggestion of in banc consideration, whether upon initial hearing or rehearing, is an extraordinary procedure\nintended to bring to the attention of the entire court a precedent-setting error of exceptional importance in an\nappeal or other proceeding, and, with specific reference to a suggestion of in banc consideration upon rehearing,\nis intended to bring to the attention of the entire court a panel opinion that is allegedly in direct conflict with\nprecedent of the Supreme Court or of this circuit. Alleged errors in a panel's determination of state law, or in the\nfacts of the case (including sufficiency of the evidence), or error asserted in the panel's misapplication of correct\nprecedent to the facts of the case, are matters for rehearing before the panel but not for in banc consideration.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Standards  of  Performanca  for  Appointed  Attorneys \nhave  not  been  promulgated. \n(2)  Standards  for  indigent  defense  services  have  been \npromulgated  by  the  Georgia  Indigent  Defense  Council,  as \nwall  as  the  American  Bar  Association,  the  National  Study \nCommigsion  on  Defense  Services,  the  National  Legal  Aid  and \nDefender  Association  and  the  National  Advisary  Commissien \n‘on  Criminal  Justice  Standards  and  Goals,  Indigent  criminal \ndefense  services  in  Georgia  function  without  regard  for, \nand  in  violation  of,  these  accepted  minimum  standards. \n(9)  By  not  providing  sufficient  resources,  the  Georgia  system  of \nindigant  defense  tends  to  preclude  the  involvement  of  experienced \ndmfanse  counsel  and  promotes  reliance  on  inexperienced  counsel. \n17 \n25 \nB10‘ d  1227079: 13  Ji  19  ¥   t0:0%  (NOKS6  SO-  ‘NA\nSENT  BY: ACLU  ;  7-17-  1  3  3:58PM  LEGAL  DEPT-  202  872  8690;:#19/56 \n(h)  Additionally,  that  lack  of  resources  inecreages  the  burden  on \nindigent  criminal  defense  counsel  and  effectively  creates  a  financial \ndisincentive  for  defense  counsel  to  provide  thorough  and  effective \ndefense  services  consistent  with  minimum  standards  of  representation. \n(i)  The  f€allure  to  provide  adequately  for  essential \ninvestigative  resources,  as  well  as  other  defense-related  expenses, \nsuch  ad  expert  witnesses,  psychiatric  examinations  and  sclentific \ntests,  imposes  4  substantial  purden  on  defense  counsel. \n(j)  Counsel  are  not  appointed  to  the  defense  promptly  after  the \narrest  or,  if  appeinted,  are  net  able  to  undertake  the  imnediate \nrepresentation  of  tha  indigent  defendant,  thus  depriving  a  defendant \nof  the  opportunity  ta  obtain  affective  assistance  9f  counsel  when  the \nevidence  is  freshest  and  the  individual's  constitutional  rights  most \nat  risk.  This  deprives  indigent  defendants  of  counsal  at  critical \nstages  of  the  prosecution. \n(k)  The  disparity  in  rescurces  and  services  committed  to \nindigent  defendants  by  the  various  counties  of  Georgia  further \ncontributes  to  an  inademuate  system  for  providing  indigent  defense \nservices. \n(Ll)  In  sun,  the  Georgia  appolntment  system  provides  indigant \ndefense  attorneys  insufficient  time  and  resources  to  permit  adequate \nservices,  including  (1)  interviewing;  (2)  investigation;  (3)  research} \n(4)  motion  practlce;  (5)  trial  preparation;  (6)  client  advice;  and  (7) \noverall  attention  to  the  case,  given  forced  excesaive  caseloads. \n64. \n18 \nao \noT” d  Pecee7$: : V4  dA  79  ¥  FO:0t  (NSO6 .WS0-) “N OE\nSENT  BY: ACLU  ;  7-17-  1  3  4:00PM  ;  LEGAL  DEPT~  202  872  8690;#20/56 \nUpon  information  and  belief,  the  defcndant  Judgas  and  the  class \nof  Judges  have  failed  to  provide  for  an  adequate  indigent  defense \nsystem  within  their  raspective  jurisdictions. \n65. \nCriminal  defendants  are  brought  befora  the  court  in  the  name  of \nthe  State  of  Gaurgia  and  it  is  the  responsibility  ef  the  State  to \nagsure  that  adequate  representation  is  provided  to  those  defendants  so \nthat  they  receive  4  fair  trial. \n6&6. \nThe  State  of  Georgia  and  Defendant  Harris  are  aware  of  the \nfailuras  and  inadequacies  of  the  present  «yatem  of  providing  defenses \nto  indigents  thraughcut  the  state  but  have  failed  to  act  in  any \nresponsible  way  to  alleviate  or  remedy  it. \nFIRST  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n67, \nThe  inherent  inadequacies  of  the  Georgia  indigent  criminal \ndefense  system  and  its  lack  of  adequate  funding  deny  Plaintiffs  and \ntheir  class  the  right  to  counse?  guaranteed  tham  by  the  Constitution's \nSixth  Amendment. \nSECOND,  CAUSE OF ACTION \n66, \nThe  allegations  of  paragraphs  One  through  74  are  incorporated \nherein  as  though  set  out  in  full. \n69. \n19 \n30 \n070  ‘d  F2L7E2S: 19h  S019  ¥  10:01  (NO$6N  .)SO -  ‘NOP\nSENT  BY: ACLU  ;  7-17-  1  3  4:00PM ;  LEGAL  DEPT-  202  872  8690;#21/56\nThe  systemic  and  funding  deficiencies  of  the  Georgia  criminal \ndafenge  scheme  for  indigents  also  violate  Plaintiffs'  dua  process \nrights  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  Unlted  states \nConstitution. \nTHIRD  GAUSE OF ACTION \n70, \nParagraphs  One  through  74  are  hereby  incorparated  by  reference. \n71. \nDelays  in  appointment  of  counsel  for  those  pretrial  detainees  in \nJaLll  effectively  dany  then  theix  right  to  bail,  in  violation  of  the \nEighth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments, \nFOURTH  CAUSE  OF ACTION \n72. \nParagraphs  One  through  74  are  hereby  incorporated  by  reference, \n73. \nThe  disparity  of  rasources  and  of  effectiveness  of  representation \namong  jurisdictions  denies  equal  protection  to  those  who  suffer  for \nlack  of  local  wherewithall. \nFIFTH  CAUOF SACETIO N \n7 4  « \nParagraphs  One  through  74  are  hereby  realleged  by  incorporation. \n75. \nCriminal  defendants  with  the  financial  méang  obtain  adequate \ndefense  services. \n20 \nJT \n1e0  d  Teecg2S: 19  AN  TOV  C0:O%  (NSO6 .WSO-) “N AP \nSENT BY: ACLU  >  7-17-  1  3  4:01PM  ;  LEGAL  DEPT-  202  872  8690;#22/06 \nThe  failuras  of  the  Georgia  criminal  defense  syatem  deny  the \nequal  protection  of  the  lawa,  guaranteed  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment, \nto  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff  class  of  indigent  criminal  defendants. \n77. \nPlaintiffs  have  no  adequate  remedy  at  Law,  but  must  call  upon \nequity  for  effective  relief. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  pray  that  this  Court: \nl.

Since  the \nfiling of  this  lawsuit,  an  unprecedented  wave  of  arrests and \nprosecutions  has  strained  that  system  entirely beyond  limit. \nA  prime  example  of  the  collapse  of  the  nonsystem  of  indigent \nrepresentation  is  Fulton  County.  Indigent  defense  for  felony \nprosecutions  in  Fulton  County  is handled  by  a  combination  of \nsalaried public defenders,  and  appointed private attorneys. \nAppointed  counsel  theoretically provide  representation  in  cases \nwhich  the  defenders  are precluded  from  handling  by  conflicts  of \ninterest  or,  on  occasion,  case  overload.  All  county  appropria-\ntions  for  the  appointment  of  private  attorneys during  the  year \n. \n1990  have  been  exhausted,  however.  In  the meantime,  expanding \ncaseloads  have  pressed  already  stra~ned public defender  resources \nbeyond  the  breaking  point.

This  preliminary  injunction motion  is  filed  to \nredress  the  inadequacies  of  Fulton  County  defense,  pending  final \ndecision  in  this  matter. \nI.

Her  affidavit established  the \nfollowing: \n(a)  Ms.  Borsuk  handled  indigent  defense  in  felonies  in  Judge \nJoel  J.  Fryer's division  of  Fulton County  Superior  Court. \n(b)  Ms.  Borsuk's  open  caseload  as  of  the date  of the  motion \nwas  116  felony  cases. \n(c)  For  the  nine  months  January-September  1990,  Ms.  Borsuk \nhad  closed  another  476  felony  cases. \nCd)  On  a  single. day,  september  19,  1990,  Borsuk  received \nappointment  to  represent  45  new  clients charged  with  felonies. \n(e)  Borsuk  sought  to  limit  new  appointments  to  six a  week. 1 \nAll  of  this must  be  compared  to the  national  standard  of  150 \nnew  cases  ~pually as  the  maximum  for  those  handling  felony \ncharges,  a  limit established  by  the  National  Advisory  Commission \non  criminal  Justice  standards  and  Goals,  Task  Force  on  Courts, \nstandard  13.12  (1973).  Ms.  Borsuk's  open  caselo·ad  as  of  the  date \nof  her  motion  was  nearly  that large.  with three months  left to \ngo  in  the  year,  she  already  had  closed three  times  as  many  cases \nas  the  national  standard would  allot to  her  for  the  entire year. \nThe  45  cases  assigned  to  her  in one  week  were  nearly  one-third  of \nthe  annual  maximum.  If she  accepted  appointment  to only  six new \ncaseS  per week,  as  the motion  suggested,  she  wo~ld nevertheless \nundertake  some  three  hundred  new  cases  per  year,  or twice  as  many \n1 \nUpon  her  office's offer of  assistance  from  a  defender  from \nanother  division,  Judge  Fryer  denied  the  motion.  Borsuk  has \nsince been  demoted  from  her Superior  Court  defender's  position  to \nan  entry-level  slot  in  the  Fulton  county  Juvenile  Court. \n3 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  7-17- 1  4:15PM  LEGAL  DEPT~  202  872  8690;#47/56 \n2 \nas  the  national  standard would  allow. Her  experience  is not \natypical  for  Fulton  county  defenders,  as  the  Spangenburg  report \nchronicles. \nThe  perils of  such  incredible  pressures  are dramatized  by \nvisualizing the  interview  room  on  September  19,  1990,  the  day \ncounsel  was  assigned  45  new  cases.  Assuming  that  the  court  and \ncounsel  worked  a  full  eight-hour day,  this  schedule  permits  ten \nminutes  for  counsel  to consult with  and  about  each  client. \nDuring  this  average  ten  minutes,  counsel  must  (1)  confer  in  a \nseparate  room  with  the  prosecutor,  to  learn  not  only  the  charges, \nbut  also  an  outline  of  the  state's evidence  in  support  of  those \ncharges;  (2)  return  to  consult  with the  client,  including \ninforming  the  client generally  of  the  nature  of  the  process \nconfronting  him,  discussing  the  information  shared by  the \nprosecutor,  reviewing  the  client's side  of  the  story,  discussing \ndevelopment  of  any  possible  evidence,  discussing  the  client's \noptions,  and  coming  to a  decision  on  whether  to plead  guilty or \nnot  guilty;  and  (3)  finally,  returning  to  discuss  with  the \nprosecutor  any  plea  bargain.  In  particular,  it is obvious  that \nthis  schedule  permits  no  time  at all  for  any  investigation  of  the \nfacts  beyond  consultation  with  the  client. \nMere  description  of  the  scene  leads  to two  companion  conclu-\nsions.  First,  the  physical  and  emotional  deman~d s  of getting \nthrough  such  a  sChedule  are  inhuman.  Second,  the  schedule  per-\nmits  no  meaningful  consultation. \n)  2  Arraignment  calendars  are held  each  weeK  in  Borsuk's  division. \n4 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  7-17- 1  4:16PM  LEGAL  DEPT-l  202  872  8630;#48/56 \nBut  the  lo-minute  average  theoretically  available  to  devote \nto  each  case  is not  the  only  restraint upon  effective  representa \ntion.  The  layout  of  the  consultation area  is an  important  inhi \nbition upon  effective  representation.  Only  one  conference  room \nwas  available  to  Borsuk  for  consultation.  Because  of  the  sheer \nnumber  of  accused  to  be  transported and  guarded,  all  of her \nclients were  chained  together  and  herded  into  the  same  small \nroom,  where  they  sat  surrounding  a  central  table. \nThis  bizarre  interview  setting left counsel  with  a  Hobson's \nchoice.  She  could  consult  each  client  in  this physical  arrange-\nment,  trying  as  much  as  possible to  reduce  conversations  to  a \nwhisper  for  the  sake  of  preserving  some  modicum  of  confidentiali-\nty.  Or  she  could  demand  release  of the  accused  one  by  one  for \nconSUltation  elsewhere.  But  this  second  \"solutionll  posed  new \nproblems  of  its own.  Unlocking  cuffs  and  moving  individuals \nwould  eat  still  further  into  the  already  precious  and  limited \ntime  available.  And  the  only  other  space  available was  nearly \nequally  in the  public  domain,  a  standing  area  next  to  a  public \nwater  cooler  in  an  open  hallway,  between  Borsuk's  conference  room \nand  that of  the  prosecutor. \nCounsel's meaningful  response was  still further  inhibited by \nresource  limitations  other  than  her own.  She  and  other defenders \n. \ntraditionally have  no  infor.mation  to  go  on  at arraignment  other \nthan  what  they  are  told by  their clients that day.  Although \ncounsel  are  provided  for  many  probable  cause  hearings,  in Atlanta \nMunicipal ·Court,  essentially no  information  is  forwarded  from \n) \n-\nI ........ •  that  stage  to  the  defender  who  will  handle  pleas  or  even  trial. \n5 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  7-17- 1  4:16PM  LEGAL  DEPT-l  202  872  8690;#49/56 \n,-.. ..... \n}  A  handful  of defenders  are  stationed  in  the  county  jail,  but  even \nif one  of  those  defenders  interviews  an  accused  ther~,  he  or  she \nwill  not  appear  in the  courtroom;  fur- thermore,  files  from  those \ninterviews  or any  fol1owup  are  almost  never  forwarded  to the \ncourtroom defender.  All  of  these  coordi- nation  problems  too  are \ndiscussed  in  the  Spangenburg  Group's  report. \nEven  in  cases  where  leads  are  available,  the  Fulton defend-\nerts task  is almost  impossible.  The  staff of  o~er 20  lawyers  is \nsupported  by  not  a  single paralegal.  The  office has  two  investi-\ngators.  Defenders  spend  their own  valuable  time  on  such  un-\nskilled  but  indispensable  tasks  as  serving  subpoenas  on  potential \nwitnesses. \nThe  Borsuk petition has  created  some  helpful  publicity \naround  the  Fulton  county  crisis,  and  has  even  prompted  a  few \nconcrete  results.  The  county  commission  has  voted  money  to  hire \nfour  new  defenders.  That  number  will  help  ease  the  most  extreme \npressure,  but will  not  bring  caseloads  down  to  anything  like  a \nnumber  appropriate  for meaningful  review  and  litigation. \nWith  that sale  exception,  the  county  has  shown  no  inclina-\ntion  to  correct  the  deep-seated  structural  and  resource  problems \nfacing.the  system.  The  county's  last-minute  attempt  is  insuffi-\ncient to deal  with  even  the  short-term crisis,  let alone  those \nlong-term problems. \nIn  short,  Plaintiffs will  suffer  irreparable harm  absent \nthis  Court's  preliminary  injunction.  Plaintiffs ask  that this \nCourt  convene  a  hearing  on  Fulton  County  indigent  defense,  and \n,) \nafter hearing  order defendants  to  do  the  following: \n6 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  7-17- 1  4:17PM  LEGAL  DEPT~  202  872  8690;#50/56 \n(a)  provide  that  defendants  are  brought  before  a \njudicial officer within  48  or  72  hours  of  their arrest; \n(b)  provide  for  the  appointment  of  competent, \neffective  counsel  at  each  critical stage of  the  criminal \nprosecution,  including  at preliminary  hearings,  bond \nhearings,  arraignment,  and  trial; \n(c)  provide  that every  defendant  is  represented  by \ncompetent,  effective counsel  throughout  the. criminal  pro-\nceedings; \n(d)  limit  the  number  of  cases  to which  an  individual \nattorney  is appointed  to  a  number  that  the  attorney  can \nhandle  effectively  and  competently,  but  in  no  event  to  a \nnumber  exceeding  recognized  minimum  national  standards; \n(e)  provide  for  a  sufficient number  of  public de fen-\nders  in  Fulton  County  so  that each  defendant will  have  the \neffective  assistance  of  counsel  at  each  stage  of the \ncriminal  prosecution; \n(f)  provide  that  court appointed  attorneys  are \nadequately  compensated  and  that  fees  are based  upon  the  time \nexpended  on  the  case  rather  than  a  flat  fee  regardless  of \nthe method  by  which  the  case  is disposed  of: \n(9)  provide  attorneys  representing  indigent  defendants \nwith  adequate  support  services,  including  i~n  vestigators, \nsecretaries and  experts; \n(h)  refuse  to  accept  pleas  from  defendants  unless \nthose defendants  have  received  the  effective assistance  of \n.. j \n7 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  7-17- 1  4:18PM  LEGAL  DEPT-.  202  872  8690;#51/56 \ncounsel  and  unless  the  pleas  are  knowingly  and  intelligently \nmade; \n(i)  insure  that  arraignments  and  trials are  not \ndelayed  and  defendants  incarcerated due  to the  absence  of \nsufficient numbers  of effective and  competent  pUblic \ndefenders  or  court  appointed  counsel. \n(j)  require  the court  to provide  an  interview  setting \nconsistent with  confidential  consultation with  counsel. \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS'  INJURY  WILL  OUTWEIGH  THAT  OF  DEFENDANTS. \nDefendants  will  not  suffer anywhere  near  the  kind  of  injury \nfrom  the  entry of the  requested  injunction  that  Plaintiffs would \nsUffer  in  its absence.  The  relief requested  is nothing  more  nor \nless than  the  Constitution  requires.  Even  though  the  county \ncannot  undo  the  improvements  this  Court's  order will  require,  nor \nobtain  any  refunds'for  its advances,  those  remote  contingencies \npale  in  significance  compared  to the  constitutionally  inadequate \nrepresentation  afforded  Plaintiffs.  The  balance  of  harms  clearly \ntips  in  Plaintiffs'  favor. \nIV.  INJUNCTION  WOULD  NOT  DISSERVE  THE  PUBLIC  INTEREST. \nThe  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  declared  the  public \ninterest  in  this matter: \nThe  substance  of  the  Constitution's  guarantee  of \nthe  effective assistance  of  counsel  illuminated \ni~ \nby  reference  to  its underlying  purpose.  \"[T)ruth,U \nLord  Eldon  said,  \"is  best discovered  by  powerful \nstatements  on  both sides  of the  question.\"  This \ndictum  describes  the  unique  strength of our  system \not criminal  justice.  \"The  very  premise  of our \nadversary  system of  criminal  justice  is that \npartisan  advocacy  on  both  sides  of  a  case will  best \npromote  the  ultimate  objective  that  the guilty be \n.) \n8 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  7-17- 1  4:18PM  LEGAL  DEPT-l  202  872  8690;#52/56 \nconvicted  and  the  innocent  go  free.\"  Herring  v. \nNew  York,  422  U.S.  853,  862  (1975). \nunited  states v.

The  right  to \ncounsel  is therefore  designed  to guarantee  a  fair  trial.  ~ at \n656.  \"[I)f the  process  loses  its character  as  a  confrontation \nbetween  adversaries,  the constitutional guarantee  is violated. \nII \n~ at 656-57.  The  facts  of  the  Fulton  County  U'systeml'  show  that \nits adversarial  character  is  lost because  of  the  severe  handicaps \nimposed  upon  the defense,  which  frustrate  minimally  adequate \nrepresentation.  The  public  interest lies  in  requiring  the county \nto do  its constitutional duty. \nV.  PLAINTIFFS  ARE  LIKELY  TO  SUCCEED  ON  THE  MERITS. \nThe  Eleventh  Circuit  has  already passed  upon  the  sufficiency \nof  Plaintiffs'  claims.  \"Without  passing on  the  merits  of  these \nallegations,  we  conclude  that they  are  sufficient to  state a \nclaim  upon  which  relief could be  granted.\"  Luckey  v.  Harris,  860 \nF.2d  1012,  1018  (11th  cir.  1988),  cert.  denied,  ___  U.s.  ___  \n(1990).  The  facts  recited  in  these motion  papers  are  nothing \nshort  of compelling  in support  of  Plaintiffs'  complaints  of \nsystematic  inadequacy  of  counsel. \nIn  particular,  this Circuit has  condemned  \"asselnbly-line \njustice,\"  inVOlving  no  investigation and  no  interviewing  of wit-\nnesses.  Walker  v.  Caldwell,  476  F.2d  213,  221-24  (5th  Cir. \n1973).  Although  the  Court  stopped  short of  adopting  a  per se \nrule  of  ineffective  counsel  in  cases where  counsel  spent  a  brief \ntime  with  the  accused,  the  Court  held  that  inadequate  time  devot \ned  to  the  case  in  addi~ion to  other crucial  factors  would  dernon-\n~)  strate ineffective  assistance.  Here,  the  lack of any  other prior \n9 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  7-17- 1  4:13PM  LEGAL  DEPT...;  202  872  8630;#53/56 \n., \ninformation  about  the  case,  and  the  inhibiting physical  condi-\ntions  of  interview which  all but  preclude  confidential  and  mean \ningful  exchange  between  attorney  and  client,  are  precisely  such \nadditional  factors.  See  also  smith v.

Arizona  v.

Plaintiffs have  met  all of \nthe  requirements  for  the  issuance  of this  Court's preliminary \ninjunction.

Webster, Emory University School\nof Law, Eric G. Kocher, Kocher, Wilson, Korschun & Cobb, Robert B. Remar, Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiffs-appellants.\nAlfred L. Evans, Jr., Sr. Asst. Atty. Gen., Atlanta, Ga., for defendants-appellees.\n[*]\nBefore VANCE and HATCHETT, Circuit Judges, and SCOTT , District Judge.\nVANCE, Circuit Judge:\nThis is an appeal from dismissal of a complaint on two alternate grounds: that the eleventh amendment bars\nrelief against the defendants and that the complaint fails to state a claim for which relief could be granted.\nAppellants, on behalf of a bilateral class consisting of all indigent persons presently charged or who will be\ncharged in the future with criminal offenses in the courts of Georgia and of all attorneys who represent or will\nrepresent indigent defendants in the Georgia courts, brought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1982) against\nthe following defendants in their official capacities: Joe Frank Harris, the Governor of Georgia, the Honorable\nRobert J. Noland, Chief Judge of the Douglas Judicial Circuit, the Honorable Joe E. Crumbley, Chief Judge of the\nClayton Judicial Circuit, and all Georgia judges responsible for providing assistance of counsel to indigents\ncriminally accused in the Georgia courts. Appellants allege that systemic deficiencies including inadequate\nresources, delays in the appointment of counsel, pressure on attorneys to hurry their clients' case to trial or to\nenter a guilty plea, and inadequate supervision in the Georgia indigent criminal defense system deny indigent\ncriminal defendants their sixth amendment right to counsel, their due process rights under the fourteenth\namendment, their right to bail under the eighth and fourteenth amendments and equal protection of the laws\nguaranteed by the fourteenth amendment. Appellants seek an order requiring that appellees meet minimum\nconstitutional standards in the provision of indigent criminal defense services.\nOn June 24, 1987, the district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss on the grounds that the suit, while\nnominally against the Governor and state court judges, was in essence a suit against the state of Georgia and\ntherefore was barred by the eleventh amendment. Appellants filed a motion for reconsideration. On December\n31, 1987 the court once again granted appellees' motion to dismiss, concluding that even if the eleventh\namendment were no bar to appellants' action, the suit failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. For\nthe reasons stated below, we reverse on both grounds and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\nI.\nThe threshold issue is whether appellants' suit is barred by the eleventh amendment. The eleventh amendment\nprovides:\nThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or\n1014 equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States *1014 by Citizens of another\nState, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. XI. Although this amendment does not expressly prohibit suits in federal court against a state\nby its own citizens, it has long been interpreted to bar such suits. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct.\n504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890).\nBoth parties agree that this suit involves the scope of the exception to the eleventh amendment first stated in Ex\nparte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). This case involved a suit against a state attorney\ngeneral to enjoin him from applying against plaintiffs a state law alleged to be unconstitutional. The Supreme\nCourt held that a suit against an officer of a state directing him to refrain from unconstitutional conduct is not a\nsuit against a state within the meaning of the eleventh amendment. Id. at 156, 28 S.Ct. at 452. This exception\nhas been developed over the years to permit prospective relief against state officers in their official capacities to\nrefrain from unconstitutional conduct even though compliance may cost the state money. See, e.g., Milliken v.\nBradley, 433 U.S. 267, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977).\nThe district court held that appellants' suit fell outside the scope of the Young exception. The court relied on two\nfactors to determine that the officials named in this suit were simply surrogates for the state itself: any decree or\norder would be enforced against the state and the complaint did not allege that \"any defendant, as an individual,\nhas personally undertaken any unconstitutional or wrongful action.\" The court concluded that the state was the\nreal party in interest and the suit was barred by the eleventh amendment. We address each of these factors\nseparately.\nA.\nAppellees assert this suit is in essence against the state of Georgia because its real goal is to obtain increased\nfunding for indigent services and because the state will ultimately bear the cost of any relief ordered against the\nnamed defendants. In their complaint appellants seek an order compelling appellees to meet minimum\nconstitutional standards in the provision of indigent defense services. Specifically, they asked the court to order\nthat appellees provide attorneys at probable cause determinations if so requested by indigent defendants, for\nspeedy appointment of counsel at all critical stages in the criminal process, for adequate investigative services\nand experts, for the adequate compensation of attorneys representing indigents, and for uniform standards\ngoverning the representation of indigents to be adopted and maintained. If this relief were granted, it would\ndoubtless result in expense to the state of Georgia.\nCases defining the scope of the Ex parte Young exception, however, have focused not on the source or amount\nof funds required to be expended if relief were granted, but on whether the funds are required to be expended as\ncompensation for past wrongdoing by the state or as an \"ancillary effect\" of compliance with the court order. As\nthe Supreme Court explained in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974),\nState officials, in order to shape their official conduct to the mandate of the Court's decrees, would\nmore likely have to spend money from the state treasury than if they had been left free to pursue\ntheir previous course of conduct. Such an ancillary effect on the state treasury is a permissible\nand often an inevitable consequence of the principle announced in Ex parte Young ...\nId. at 668, 94 S.Ct. at 1358. See also Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. at 289, 97 S.Ct. at 2461 (eleventh amendment\nno bar to court order that state defendants pay one-half costs attributable to education components in school\ndesegregation plan; the Young exception \"permits federal courts to enjoin state officials to conform their conduct\nto requirements of federal law, notwithstanding a direct and substantial impact on the state treasury\").\nAdmittedly, \"the difference between the type of relief barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted under\n1015 Ex parte Young will not in many instances be that between day and night.\" Edelman,*1015 415 U.S. at 667, 94\nS.Ct. at 1357. The touchstone, however, is whether an expenditure is a \"necessary result of compliance with\ndecrees which by their terms [are] prospective in nature,\" id. at 668, 94 S.Ct. at 1358, or a goal in itself. Edelman\ndemonstrates this distinction. The Supreme Court reversed an order requiring the retroactive payment of benefits\nfound to be wrongfully withheld by Illinois officials from applicants for state-administered aid to the aged, blind\nand disabled. On appeal the state \"concede[d] that Ex Parte Young ... is no bar to that part of the District Court's\n\njudgment that prospectively enjoined petitioner's predecessors from failing to process applications within the time\nlimits established by the federal regulations.\" Id. at 664, 94 S.Ct. at 1356. The Court concluded, however, that the\neleventh amendment did bar the order requiring retroactive payment of benefits because\n[i]t requires payment of state funds, not as a necessary consequence of compliance in the future\nwith a substantive federal-question determination, but as a form of compensation to those whose\napplications were processed on the slower time schedule at a time when petitioner was under no\ncourt-imposed obligation to conform to a different standard.\nId. at 668, 94 S.Ct. at 1358.\nLikewise, in Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986), the Court held that while\nthe eleventh amendment did not bar an equal protection clause challenge to the unequal distribution of funds\nfrom lands set aside to support local schools, it did bar attempts to require state officials to pay to some local\nschool boards yearly income based on amounts that had been generated by lands set aside to fund local\neducation before the lands were sold by state officials. While the Court recognized that these claims could be\nsimilar, it noted that the determining factor is the theory of the relief sought.\nIt may be that the current disparity results directly from the same actions in the past that are the\nsubject of the petitioners' trust claims, but the essence of the equal protection allegation is the\npresent disparity in the distribution of the benefits of state-held assets and not the past actions of\nthe State. A remedy to eliminate this current disparity, even a remedy that might require the\nexpenditure of state funds, would ensure\" `compliance in the future with a substantive federal-\nquestion determination'\" rather than bestow an award for accrued monetary liability. Milliken [v.\nBradley], 433 U.S. at 289, 97 S.Ct. at 2762 (quoting Edelman, 415 U.S. at 664, 94 S.Ct. at 1356).\nPapasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. at 282, 106 S.Ct. at 2942 (emphasis in original).\nWhen this test is applied to the relief appellants seek, it is clear that the eleventh amendment does not bar their\nsuit. Appellants seek an order to compel appellees to provide indigent defense services that meet minimum\nconstitutional standards. While the state ultimately may finance compliance with such an order, this fact is not\ndeterminative. Any funds that the state of Georgia may be required to spend if appellants were successful on the\nmerits would be an ancillary effect of future compliance with constitutional standards. Accordingly, we hold that\nthe relief appellants seek falls within the Ex parte Young exception to the eleventh amendment's general\nprohibition of suits brought against a state by its own citizens.\nB.\nWe turn now to two related claims concerning the naming of state officials as defendants in this action. Appellees\nassert that the Ex parte Young exception requires that the defendants must have taken some action personally\nthat violates the Constitution.\nPersonal action by defendants individually is not a necessary condition of injunctive relief against state officers in\ntheir official capacity. All that is required is that the official be responsible for the challenged action. As the Young\ncourt held, it is sufficient that the state officer sued must, \"by virtue of his office, ha[ve] some connection\" with the\n1016 unconstitutional act or *1016 conduct complained of. \"[W]hether [this connection] arises out of general law, or is\nspecially created by the act itself, is not material so long as it exists.\" Young, 209 U.S. at 157, 28 S.Ct. at 453.\nAccording to the Georgia constitution, the governor is responsible for law enforcement in that state and is\ncharged with executing the laws faithfully. Ga. Const. Art. 5, § 2, ¶ 2. The governor further has the residual power\nto commence criminal prosecutions, Ga.Code Ann. § 17-1-2 (1982), and has the final authority to direct the\nAttorney General to \"institute and prosecute\" on behalf of the state. Id. § 45-15-35. Judges are responsible for\nadministering the system of representation for the indigent criminally accused. Id. §§ 17-12-4 to -10, 17-12-60.\nDefendants are therefore appropriate parties against whom prospective relief could be ordered. See Papasan v.\nAllain, 487 U.S. at 282 n. 14, 106 S.Ct. at 2943 n. 14 (Secretary of state responsible for \"general supervision\" of\nadministration by local school officials of lands set aside for educational purposes properly could be enjoined\n\nunder Young exception in suit alleging violation of equal protection in distribution of funds from land). See also \nFortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 85 S.Ct. 498, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (1965) (Georgia Secretary of State sued in\napportionment case); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d506 (1964) (Alabama Secretary\nof State sued in apportionment case).\nAppellees further contend that the dismissal should be upheld because there is no \"case or controversy\" between\nthe parties in this suit. This claim is largely foreclosed by our analysis above. In any event, we conclude that\nappellants' allegations that they are presently being denied constitutional rights as a direct result of the failure of\nappellees to furnish counsel in a manner that meets minimum constitutional standards is sufficient to satisfy the\nArticle III requirement of an allegation that they have sustained or are immediately in danger of sustaining some\n\"real and immediate injury\" resulting from challenged official conduct. See United Pub. Workers of America v.\nMitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 88-91, 67 S.Ct. 556, 563-65, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947).\nII.\nWe next address whether the suit was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim for which relief can be\ngranted under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On such a motion the complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears\n\"beyond doubt that the plaintiff[s] can prove no set of facts in support of [their] claim that would entitle [them] to\nrelief.\" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-02, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); accord Bradberry v.\nPinellas County, 789 F.2d 1513, 1515 (11th Cir.1986). Even taking the allegations of the complaint as true, the\ndistrict court concluded that appellants had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\nThe problem with plaintiffs' claim is that they seek an across-the-board ruling that the Georgia\ncriminal defense scheme systematically denies or will deny in the future effective assistance of\ncounsel to the indigent accused.... The Supreme Court, however, has explained that an evaluation\nof effective assistance is inextricably bound up with the particular facts of a case. Few are the\ncircumstances that a court can declare so compromising that ineffective assistance is essentially\ninevitable.\n(emphasis in original). The district court's ruling clearly indicated that appellants had to prove \"an across-the-\nboard future inevitability of ineffective assistance.\" Taking the facts of the complaint as true, the court concluded\nthat appellants' allegations were insufficient to meet the \"ineffective assistance of counsel\" standard as set forth\nin Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) and United States v. Cronic,\n[1]\n466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984) and dismissed appellants' complaint.\n1017 *1017 We cannot agree that appellants' burden in this action for injunctive relief was to establish that ineffective\nassistance was inevitable for each of the class members. Accordingly, we reverse.\nStrickland v. Washington established the test for determining when counsel has rendered ineffective assistance.\nThis test requires that the prisoner show: (1) that the performance of his counsel was deficient, i.e., that he\n\"made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the `counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\nAmendment\" and (2) that the deficient performance by his counsel prejudiced his defense, i.e., \"that counsel's\nerrors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\" 466 U.S. at 687,\n104 S.Ct. at 2064.\nThis standard is inappropriate for a civil suit seeking prospective relief. The sixth amendment protects rights that\ndo not affect the outcome of a trial. Thus, deficiencies that do not meet the \"ineffectiveness\" standard may\nnonetheless violate a defendant's rights under the sixth amendment. In the post-trial context, such errors may be\ndeemed harmless because they did not affect the outcome of the trial. Whether an accused has been prejudiced\nby the denial of a right is an issue that relates to relief 00 whether the defendant is entitled to have his or her\n97\nconviction overturned 00 rather than to the question of whether such a right exists and can be protected\n97\nprospectively. See, e.g., Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970) (Alabama\npreliminary hearing in which determination is made if there is sufficient evidence to warrant presenting a case to\ngrand jury is \"critical stage\" in the state's criminal process at which the accused is entitled to assistance of\ncounsel; remand to determine whether denial of counsel prejudiced defense so as to require new trial); United\n\nStates v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967) (post-indictment line-up for purpose of\nidentification is \"critical stage\" in criminal process at which accused is entitled to assistance of counsel; remand to\ndetermine if the introduction of evidence from hearing was harmless error requiring no new trial); Pugh v.\nRainwater, 483 F.2d 778, 787 (5th Cir.1973) (\"The distinction between a pre-trial declaration of a right to a\nhearing and a post-conviction appeal for reversal on the basis of the absence of such hearing is a pragmatic and\nsensible distinction.\") aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 95\nS.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975).\nWhere a party seeks to overturn his or her conviction, powerful considerations warrant granting this relief only\nwhere that defendant has been prejudiced. The Strickland court noted the following factors in favor of deferential\nscrutiny of a counsel's performance in the post-trial context: concerns for finality, concern that extensive post-trial\nburdens would discourage counsel from accepting cases, and concern for the independence of counsel. 466\nU.S. at 690 These considerations do not apply when only prospective relief is sought.\nProspective relief is designed to avoid future harm. Swift & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 311, 326, 48 S.Ct. 311,\n315, 72 L.Ed. 587 (1928). Therefore, it can protect constitutional rights, even if the violation of these rights would\nnot affect the outcome of a trial. For example, in Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54\n(1975), the Supreme Court considered the claims of a class of accused individuals detained in Florida jails\nwithout a determination of probable cause. The detainees had been granted declaratory and injunctive relief in\nthe court below. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed that part of the Court of Appeal's decision declaring that\nthe Florida procedure violated defendants' rights under the fourth amendment because it did not require a timely\njudicial determination of probable cause as a condition of detention pending trial. Id. at 126, 95 S.Ct. at 869. Yet\nthe Court expressly noted that a showing of illegal arrest or detention is not automatic grounds for overturning a\nsubsequent conviction. Id. at 119, 95 S.Ct. at 865.\nIn a suit for prospective relief the plaintiff's burden is to show \"the likelihood of substantial and immediate\nirreparable injury, and the inadequacy of remedies at law.\" O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 502, 94 S.Ct. 669,\n1018 679, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974); see*1018also, United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894,\n897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953). This is the standard to which appellants, as a class, should have been held.\nAppellants have alleged that systemic delays in the appointment of counsel deny them their sixth amendment\nright to the representation of counsel at critical stages in the criminal process, hamper the ability of their counsel\nto defend them, and effectively deny them their eighth and fourteenth amendment right to bail, that their attorneys\nare denied investigative and expert resources necessary to defend them effectively, that their attorneys are\npressured by courts to hurry their case to trial or to enter a guilty plea, and that they are denied equal protection\nof the laws.

Remar, Neil Bradley, Laughlin McDonald, Kathleen\nWilde, Derek Aphrin, American Civ. Liberties Union Foundation, Inc., Atlanta, Ga., for respondents.\nBefore HATCHETT, COX and BIRCH, Circuit Judges.\nBIRCH, Circuit Judge:\nAppellants (defendants below) have presented to this court a petition for permission to appeal pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1292(b) and Fed.R.App.P. 5. For the reasons that follow, the petition is GRANTED.\nI. BACKGROUND\nAppellees (plaintiffs below) filed their complaint in this case on October 24, 1986 and their amendment to that\ncomplaint on November 25, 1986. The class action was initiated by two groups of plaintiffs: (1) all present and\nfuture indigent persons charged with criminal offenses in the courts of Georgia; and, (2) all attorneys who\nrepresent indigent defendants in those courts.\n[1]\nPlaintiffs contend that certain systemic deficiencies  in the Georgia indigent criminal defense system deny\nindigent criminal defendants their sixth amendment right to counsel, their due process rights under the fourteenth\namendment, their right to bail under the eighth and fourteenth amendments, and equal protection of the laws\nguaranteed by the fourteenth amendment. Plaintiffs seek intervention by the federal courts in the state indigent\ncriminal representation system to establish minimum constitutional standards and to enforce adherence to those\ncourt-ordered standards.\nThe defendants in the action are, respectively, the Governor of the State of Georgia and all judges of the state\ncourts of Georgia who appoint attorneys or otherwise arrange for the defense of indigent criminal defendants.\nDefendants, through their counsel, the Attorney General of the State of Georgia, filed a motion to dismiss based\n[2]\nupon several alternative theories.  On June 24, 1987, the district court entered an order dismissing the case,\n[3]\nconcluding that jurisdiction was lacking due to \"the State's invocation of Eleventh Amendment immunity\".\nThereafter, in response to plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, the district court entered a subsequent order on\nDecember 31, 1987 which held \"that assuming that the Eleventh Amendment is no bar to maintenance of this\n890 action, the action must be dismissed for failure to state a claim for *890 which relief can be granted\".[4]\nAn appeal to this court followed. Defendants' appellate brief and reply briefs focused on the eleventh amendment\nand statement of claim issues and did not advance any arguments addressing issues of equity, comity or\nfederalism. Plaintiffs' briefing was consistent with the approach employed by defendants. In seeking to have this\n[5] [6]\ncourt affirm the dismissal by the district court on any grounds,  the defendants presented several arguments\n[7]\nin their brief on appeal. None of these arguments, however, embraced the concepts of comity or federalism.  A\n\n[8]\npanel of this court  entered its decision on November 23, 1988. Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 (11th Cir.1988).\nThat opinion did not address the abstention doctrine.\nThe defendants filed a suggestion of rehearing en banc on December 13, 1988. In that application to the court,\ndefendants cited neither Younger v. Harris nor O'Shea v. Littleton, and invocation of the abstention doctrine was\nnot advanced or suggested. Thereafter, a poll was conducted pursuant to I.O.P. 5 (under Fed.R.App.P. 35 and\n11th Cir.R. 35). Because an \"affirmative vote of a majority of circuit judges in regular active service\" was not\nobtained, the court entered a per curiam order on December 29, 1989 denying the petition for rehearing en banc.\n[9] [10] [11]\n A dissent  was filed with the order of denial.  The panel's per curiam opinion did not address the\nabstention doctrine issue, but the dissent noted that the abstention doctrine had not been \"asserted expressly\"\n[12]\nbefore concluding that the court should have considered the issue.  In his dissent, Judge Edmondson also\nstated that the panel's opinion in the instant case conflicted with two prior decisions which were binding on the\ncourt: Gardner v. Luckey, 500 F.2d 712 (5th Cir.1974),cert. denied,423 U.S. 841, 96 S.Ct. 73, 46 L.Ed.2d 61\n891 (1975),*891 and Tarter v. Hury, 646 F.2d 1010 (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981). Thereafter, the Supreme Court denied\ndefendants' certiorari petition.\nThis court, in its initial opinion reversing the dismissal of the action by the district court, remanded the case \"for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\" Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d at 1018. On remand, defendants filed\na motion to dismiss based upon the abstention doctrine and the rulings of the Fifth Circuit applying that doctrine, \nGardner v. Luckey and Tarter v. Hury, which they argued would be binding on this court under Bonner v. City of\nPrichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981). Defendants stated that since the abstention doctrine question had\nnot been presented to, or adjudicated by, this court there was no \"law of the case\" problem before the district\n[13]\ncourt.  The district court disagreed.\nIn an order entered on July 10, 1990, the district court thoroughly considered the abstention issue before\nconcluding that defendants' motion to dismiss, based on considerations of comity, equity and federalism, was\nmeritorious. However, the court felt constrained by the \"law of the case\" to deny defendants' post-remand motion\nto dismiss. In pertinent part, the district court opined as follows:\n[T]his Court believes that the abstention doctrine applies because, in its opinion, requiring the\nstate, prospectively, to run an indigent defense system consistent with constitutional norms is an\nunwarranted intrusion into the business of the state.\nDespite the Court's perception of the strength of its opinion based on what it believes to be settled\nlaw, the entire Eleventh Circuit was faced with Judge Edmondson's arguments and declined to\nrehear the case, or even to stay the mandate pending Supreme Court review of the certiorari\npetition. This situation puts the Court in a difficult situation. On the one hand, as Defendants argue\nin their reply brief, the appellate panel did not expressly reach abstention and the denial of\nrehearing without an opinion bears little, if any, precedential weight.\nOn the other hand, by soundly reversing this Court, denying rehearing, denying rehearing en banc\nin the face of Judge Edmondson's dissent, and denying Defendants' motion to stay the mandate\npending the Supreme Court's disposition of Defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari, the\nEleventh Circuit gave this Court the clear message that this case should be heard. The Court\ntherefore concludes, under the law of the case, that the abstention doctrine does not apply. See \nLitman v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, 825 F.2d 1506, 1510 (11th Cir.1987),\ncert. denied,484 U.S. 1006 [108 S.Ct. 700, 98 L.Ed.2d 652] (1988). The Court's conclusion is\nreinforced by the fact that abstention goes to the equitable jurisdiction of this Court such that the\nappellate court should have ordered that this Court abstain had it concurred in Judge\nEdmondson's reasoning.\nThe Court makes clear that it would have dismissed the complaint on abstention grounds were it\nnot for this Court's conclusion regarding the Eleventh Circuit's rulings. The Court is sympathetic to\nthe concerns of the Plaintiffs, as it believes that the relief they seek would make it easier for the\nstate to provide for the constitutional rights of indigent criminal defendants. The Court's concern,\n\nhowever, is that the far reaching remedy sought runs afoul of federalism principles that lie at the\nheart of our constitutional form of government.\nDue to the significance and magnitude of this case, however, the Court sua sponte certifies, under\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), that this ruling \"involves a controlling question of law as to which there is\nsubstantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may\n892 materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" *892 If this Court has erred in its\ninterpretation of the Eleventh Circuit rulings, then the error can be corrected before the necessarily\nprotracted proceedings in this complex case of first impression have consumed substantial judicial\nand financial resources.\nDistrict Court Order at 10-12 (July 10, 1990) (footnote omitted).\nAfter entry of the order by the district court, quoted in pertinent part above, defendants filed a petition for\npermission to appeal to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) and Fed.R.App.P. 5. As framed by defendants,\nthe issue to be considered on this application is \"whether there is a `law of the case' barrier to the District Court's\njurisdictional dismissal of this case in accordance with controlling Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent\non the applicability of the abstention doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 [91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669]\n[14]\n(1971).\"\nII. DISCUSSION\nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), the district court may certify an interlocutory order for appeal if the order (1) involves\na controlling question of law, (2) as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and (3) an\nimmediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. Ray v.\nEdwards, 725 F.2d 655, 658 (11th Cir.1984). The statute requires an \"order\" from the district court that is directly\nassociated with the disposition of at least a claim, if not the entire case itself. See Church of Scientology Flag\nService Org., Inc. v. City of Clearwater, 777 F.2d 598, 608 (11th Cir.1985),cert. denied,476 U.S. 1116, 106 S.Ct.\n1973, 90 L.Ed.2d 656 (1986). Moreover, the jurisdiction of this court is not confined to the precise question\ncertified by the district court because the statute presents the \"order\" to us, not merely the question. See United\nStates v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 677, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 3060, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987).\nApplying the statutory criteria, it is manifest that we should exercise our discretion and grant the petition for\nimmediate review, because our review of the order below will determine the immediate future of this case. In that\n[15]\norder, the district court plainly and unequivocally stated that it would abstain and dismiss plaintiff's case  but\n[16]\nfor its determination that, under the law of this case, the abstention doctrine does not apply.  The legal issue\nas to whether the law of the case in this action would prohibit a dismissal of plaintiffs' claims through invocation of\nthe abstention doctrine is squarely presented. Accordingly, the order certified for review involves a controlling\nquestion of law which may ultimately terminate this litigation.\nThe remaining consideration, therefore, is whether substantial grounds for a difference of opinion exist on the law\n[17]\nof the case preclusion issue. A review of several recent decisions by this court  on law of the case suggests\nthat fertile ground for disagreement exists given the circumstances of this case. This court's most recent opinion\ndiscussing the law of the case doctrine states:\n893 The doctrine does not extend to every issue that could ever be raised in a given *893 litigation but\nrather is limited to those issues previously decided; the law is clear, however, that the law of the\ncase doctrine \"comprehends things decided by necessary implication as well as those decided\nexplicitly.\" Wheeler v. City of Pleasant Grove, 746 F.2d 1437, 1440 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam)\n(emphasis in original; quotation omitted); Piambino [v. Bailey], 757 F.2d [1112] at 1120 [(11th\nCir.1985)].\nHeathcoat v. Potts, 905 F.2d 367, 370 (11th Cir.1990). Accordingly, we must decide whether the panel decision\nannounced on November 23, 1988 determined the abstention question by implication, since that issue was not\nexpressly presented to or decided by this court.\n\nDefendants contend that the Fifth Circuit's decision in Wilcox v. Miller, 691 F.2d 739 (5th Cir.1982), is persuasive\nauthority for finding that the district court is not precluded from invoking the abstention doctrine. In Wilcox the\ncomplaint was dismissed by the district court, which concluded that habeas corpus was the proper remedy when\ndelays were alleged in appointment of counsel for indigent criminal defendants. On the initial appeal the Fifth\nCircuit reversed, finding that habeas corpus was not a viable remedy since the complaint did not seek release\nfrom, or modification of, confinement. The court of appeals ruled instead that the action was cognizable as a\nsection 1983 civil rights action. On remand, the district court found in favor of the defendants on the merits\nfollowing an evidentiary hearing. The plaintiff appealed again and the Fifth Circuit held, notwithstanding the\ndecision of its prior panel on the first appeal, that the matter should not have been tried, but should have been\ndismissed pursuant to the abstention doctrine. In the second Wilcox appeal, the Fifth Circuit found that:\nThe doctrine of the law of the case does not prevent us from ordering a dismissal of the complaint\nwhere an earlier panel of this court reversed a dismissal on other grounds.\nWilcox v. Miller, 691 F.2d at 740 n. 2. Plaintiffs argue that, contrary to the situation in Wilcox, the issue of\n[18]\nabstention was raised \"during the rehearing process, and therefore stand[s] rejected.\"  Defendants counter\nthat there was no indication in the court's denial as to why a majority was not persuaded to grant rehearing en\nbanc, so it is mere surmise or speculation to ascribe any particular reason or basis to the denial. Defendants\nequate a summary order of denial by this court to the Supreme Court's denial of certiorari, which, they argue,\ndoes not in any way constitute an opinion on the merits of the case in which the petition is denied. See, e.g., \nHughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 365 n. 1., 93 S.Ct. 647, 650, 34 L.Ed.2d 577 (1973).\nDefendants could be correct; there are substantial grounds for their contention that the district court was not\nbound by law of the case to reject the abstention doctrine of Younger.\nThe dissent insists that this court's prior denial of defendants' petition for rehearing en banc should preclude the\ndistrict court from dismissing this action under the abstention doctrine. By attempting to attach precedential\nweight to a denial of rehearing en banc, however, the dissent suggests an untenable rule. If a poll results in the\ndenial of a petition for rehearing en banc, and that denial establishes the law of the case, then any judge who\ndisagreed with any part of a challenged panel opinion would be obligated to vote in favor of en banc review.\nFailure of the poll would place the weight of the full court behind every conceivable express or implied holding in\n[19]\nthe panel opinion. Such a practice would be unwieldy and ultimately unworkable.\n894 *894 Based upon the foregoing, it seems that granting the petition to appeal the district court's order will permit\nus to consider a controlling question of law, on which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion, which\nmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. Moreover, to realize the full benefit from this\nprocedure, further proceedings in the district court should not be undertaken pending resolution of this appeal.\nAccordingly, we hereby stay all proceedings in the district court pending resolution of this appeal. The parties are\ndirected to comply with the I.O.P. under Fed.R.App.P. 5.\nHATCHETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nThe real issue in this case is: How many times may a litigant lose the same case by raising new grounds of\ndefense? In the original litigation, Georgia's state court judges and the state of Georgia moved to dismiss this\naction on the grounds of (1) eleventh amendment immunity, (2) lack of Article III \"case or controversy,\" (3) lack of\nfederal question \"substantiality,\" and (4) lack of a justiciable claim. The district court dismissed the case on the\nbasis of eleventh amendment immunity. Upon reconsideration, the district court dismissed the case for failure to\nstate a claim upon which relief could be granted. Significantly, issues regarding comity, federalism, and\nabstention, were never pleaded, never briefed, never argued, and never ruled upon.\nIn Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.1988), we reversed the district court holding:\nAppellants have alleged that systemic delays in the appointment of counsel deny them their sixth\namendment right to the representation of counsel at critical stages in the criminal process, hamper\nthe ability of their counsel to defend them, and effectively deny them their eighth and fourteenth\namendment right to bail, that their attorneys are denied investigative and expert resources\n\nnecessary to defend them effectively, that their attorneys are pressured by courts to hurry their\ncase to trial or to enter a guilty plea, and that they are denied equal protection of the laws. Without\npassing on the merits of these allegations, we conclude that they are sufficient to state a claim\nupon which relief could be granted. See Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84\nL.Ed.2d 53 (1985); Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 32 L.Ed.2d 530 (1972); \nColeman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970); United States v. Wade,\n388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct.\n157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961).\nWe remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. At the request of a judge of the court,\nthe court conducted an en banc poll. The court voted not to reconsider the case en banc. Judge Edmondson filed\na dissent to the court's failure to take the case en banc, the heart of which states:\nThe most troublesome aspect of this case is its disregard for federalism and comity between\nfederal and state courts. The lower federal courts are not and ought not to be the general\nsupervisors of state courts; yet this is what the complaint seeks. Lower federal courts 00 that is,\n97\ndistrict and circuit courts 00 can enforce the sixth amendment against the states; but the\n97\n895 appropriate enforcement mechanism is post-conviction habeas corpus *895 relief, operating on a\ncase-by-case basis and grounded upon a finding of prejudice.\nLuckey v. Harris, 896 F.2d 479, 480-81 (11th Cir.1989) (Edmondson, J., dissenting). Judge Cox and two other\njudges joined in the dissent. The state of Georgia and Georgia's judges then sought certiorari in the United States\nSupreme Court. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Harris v. Luckey,___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct.\n2562, 109 L.Ed.2d 744 (1990). The Eleventh Circuit issued its mandate.\nWhat is to be done upon issuance of the mandate? The district court is to proceed in accordance with the\nEleventh Circuit's opinion. That is, it must try the issues that the parties have \"joined.\"\nPicking up on the dissent from the Eleventh Circuit's denial of en banc consideration, the state of Georgia and\nGeorgia's state court judges filed another motion to dismiss. Not only did the motion to dismiss raise new and\nuntimely grounds for dismissal, but the grounds offered mirrored those outlined in Judge Edmondson's dissent:\ncomity, federalism and abstention.\nThe district court held that the law of the case kept it from dismissing the complaint on these new, untimely,\nrecently-suggested grounds. Having correctly ruled on this issue, the district court nevertheless certified the case\nfor interlocutory appeal finding that this ruling \"involves a controlling question of law as to which there is\nsubstantial ground for difference of opinion.\" See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\nThe law of the case barred the district court's dismissal of this action. As the district court correctly reasoned\nwhen denying the motion to dismiss:\nby soundly reversing this Court, denying rehearing, denying rehearing en banc in the face of\nJudge Edmondson's dissent, and denying Defendants' motion to stay the mandate pending the\nSupreme Court's disposition of Defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari, the Eleventh Circuit\ngave this Court the clear message that this case should be heard. The Court therefore concludes,\nunder the law of the case, that the abstention doctrine does not apply. See Litman v.\nMassachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, 825 F.2d 1506, 1510 (11th Cir.1987),cert.\ndenied,484 U.S. 1006, 108 S.Ct. 700, 98 L.Ed.2d 652 (1988).\nThe public and legal community expect more from the federal courts. When every pleading can be amended on\ndemand, and every previous ruling can be revisited and reversed at any time, a legal system becomes chaotic.\nWhen the outcome of a case changes simply because the membership of a court changes, the public's respect\nfor the legal system is eroded.\n\n[1] These deficiencies include: inadequate resources; delays in the appointment of counsel; pressure on\nappointed counsel to hurry their clients' cases to trial or to enter a guilty plea; and inadequate supervision in the\nGeorgia indigent criminal defense system.\n[2] The theories relied upon by defendant Joe Frank Harris in his original motion to dismiss (filed December 1,\n1986) included: (1) lack of jurisdiction under the eleventh amendment; (2) no Article III \"case or controversy\"; (3)\nthe \"federal question\" presented lacked \"substantiality\"; and (4) the presentation of \"non-justiciable\" claims. The\nlegal basis for the motion to dismiss filed by the defendant Superior Court Judges (on December 17, 1986)\nincluded grounds identical to those asserted by the Governor of Georgia in his motion.\n[3] Order of Judge Harold L. Murphy, United States District Court For The Northern District Of Georgia, dated\nJune 24, 1987, at 6.\n[4] Order of Judge Harold L. Murphy, United States District Court For The Northern District Of Georgia, dated\nDecember 31, 1987, at 1. The district court concluded: \"This Court cannot rule that a delay of a certain number of\ndays or the State's failure to provide a certain number of dollars for defense expenses constitutes an across-the-\nboard future inevitability of ineffective assistance under any set of facts alleged or implied in the plaintiffs'\ncomplaint. The Court thus holds that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief, and the complaint will be\ndismissed.\" Id. at 6.\n[5] This approach was predicated upon the axiom, acknowledged in their initial appellate brief at page 11, that a\ntrial court's final judgment will be affirmed on appeal if it is correct for any reason, even where the stated ground\nfor the decision is superfluous or erroneous. See In re Greenbrook Carpet Co., Inc., 722 F.2d 659, 660 n. 1 (11th\nCir.1984).\n[6] Defendants' brief primarily raised four arguments: (1) the eleventh amendment bar is fully applicable to the\nfacts in the case; (2) there exists no \"case or controversy\" sufficient to support federal jurisdiction; (3) the alleged\n\"federal questions\" lack that degree of \"substantiality\" required for the exercise of federal subject matter\njurisdiction; and, (4) the action is subject to dismissal for its failure to state a claim for which relief could be\ngranted, emphasizing (a) the nonjusticiable nature of the \"funding\" issues, (b) the political question nature of the\nclaims and (c) the futility of the relief sought against the defendants named.\n[7] The seminal Supreme Court decisions discussing comity and federalism and the abstention doctrine, Younger\nv. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971) and O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669,\n38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974), were cited only once in the defendants' brief (on page 23), relative to this comment:\n\"`Injury in fact' means injury which is real rather than merely abstract, theoretical, conjectural or speculative.\" The\ncomment was made in the context of the argument that no \"case or controversy\" was presented in the case. This\nargument was specifically addressed by the panel in Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1016 (11th Cir.1988),cert.\ndenied,___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 2562, 109 L.Ed.2d 744 (1990).\n[8] The panel consisted of two active circuit judges, Judge Robert S. Vance and Judge Joseph W. Hatchett, and a\ndistrict judge, Judge Thomas E. Scott, sitting by designation. Judge Vance authored the opinion.\n[9] The order indicates that Judge Vance participated in the poll prior to his death on December 16, 1989.\n[10] The dissent was authored by Judge J.L. Edmondson, and Chief Judge Gerald B. Tjoflat, Judge Peter T. Fay,\nand Judge Emmett R.

In any event, the absence of stated reasons for the denial\nillustrates the danger in ascribing any meaning to that decision within the context of the law of the case. This is\nparticularly important in light of the standard set out in the 11th Cir.R. 35-3 [\"Extraordinary Nature of Suggestions\nof In Banc Consideration.\"]: \nA suggestion of in banc consideration, whether upon initial hearing or rehearing, is an extraordinary procedure\nintended to bring to the attention of the entire court a precedent-setting error of exceptional importance in an\nappeal or other proceeding, and, with specific reference to a suggestion of in banc consideration upon rehearing,\nis intended to bring to the attention of the entire court a panel opinion that is allegedly in direct conflict with\nprecedent of the Supreme Court or of this circuit. Alleged errors in a panel's determination of state law, or in the\nfacts of the case (including sufficiency of the evidence), or error asserted in the panel's misapplication of correct\nprecedent to the facts of the case, are matters for rehearing before the panel but not for in banc consideration.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "896 F.2d 479 (1989)\nHorace LUCKEY, III, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants,\nv.\nJoe Frank HARRIS, Governor, et al., Defendants-Appellees.\nNo. 88-8047.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.\nDecember 29, 1989.\nNeil Bradley and Laughlin McDonald, American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, Inc., David A. Webster, Robert\nB. Remar, Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiffs-appellants.\nAlfred L. Evans, Jr., Sr. Asst. Atty. Gen., Atlanta, Ga., for defendants-appellees.\n[*] [**]\nBefore VANCE  and HATCHETT, Circuit Judges, and SCOTT , District Judge.\nON PETITIONS FOR REHEARING AND SUGGESTIONS OF\nREHEARING IN BANC\n(Opinion November 23, 1988, 11th Cir., 1988, 860 F.2d 1012).\nPER CURIAM:\nThe Petition(s) for Rehearing are DENIED and the Court having been polled at the request of one of the\nmembers of the Court and a majority of the Circuit Judges who are in regular active service not having voted in\nfavor of it (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Eleventh Circuit Rule 35-5), the Suggestion(s) of\nRehearing In Banc are also DENIED.\nEDMONDSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting in which TJOFLAT, Chief Judge, FAY and COX, Circuit Judges, join:\nConcerns of equity, comity and federalism make this an exceptionally important case. Today's court unfortunately\nhas declined to give the case that extra consideration which comes with in banc rehearing. On our court, dissents\nare rarely written when we decline in banc rehearing; but the principles involved here require me to protest and to\nexplain briefly the way I see the case.\nThe district judge dismissed this case, believing that he lacked the authority to grant the relief sought by plaintiffs.\nI believe the district court's judgment was correct. The panel opinion misconstrues the sixth amendment and\ndisregards considerations of comity and federalism that underlie Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27\nL.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and its progeny, including our own decisions. The result of these errors is to place Georgia's\nstate courts potentially under the direct supervision of a single federal district judge.\nThe panel opinion holds that the following allegations are sufficient to state a claim for injunctive relief\n(presumably enforceable by contempt) against the Governor of Georgia and all Georgia judges who preside over\ncriminal trials of indigent defendants in the Georgia courts:\n[Plaintiffs] have alleged that systematic delays in the appointment of counsel deny them their sixth\namendment right to the representation of counsel at critical stages in the criminal process, hamper\nthe ability of their counsel to defend them, and effectively deny them their eighth and fourteenth\namendment right to bail, that their attorneys are denied investigative and expert resources\nnecessary to defend them effectively, that their attorneys are pressured by courts to hurry their\ncase to trial or to enter a guilty plea, and that they are denied equal protection of the laws.\n\nLuckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.1988). Plaintiffs' complaint asks the federal court to order\n480 defendants to pay indigent-defense lawyers more, to provide *480 counsel earlier in the criminal process, and to\nprovide more defense services and expert resources. I think that plaintiffs' sixth amendment allegations fail to\n[1]\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.\nTwo sentences form the linchpin of the panel's opinion: \"The sixth amendment protects rights that do not affect\nthe outcome of a trial. Thus, deficiencies that do not meet the `ineffectiveness' standard may nonetheless violate\na defendant's rights under the sixth amendment.\" Id. at 1017. No citation of authority follows these statements.\nMore important, this view of the sixth amendment is inconsistent with the language and rationale of both \nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2047, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984).\nThe sixth amendment is inextricably bound up with the fairness of a defendant's trial: \"[T]he right to the effective\nassistance of counsel is recognized not for its own sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of the\naccused to receive a fair trial.\" Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. at 2046 (emphasis added). \"[T]he Sixth\nAmendment['s purpose] is not to improve the quality of legal representation....\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104\nS.Ct. at 2065. \"The purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the\nassistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding. Accordingly, any deficiencies in\ncounsel's performance must be prejudicial to the defense in order to constitute ineffective assistance under the\nConstitution.\" Id. at 691-92, 104 S.Ct. at 2067 (emphasis added). Thus, the sixth amendment right to counsel is\nnot an abstract right to a particular level of representation; it is the right to the representation necessary for a fair\n[2]\ntrial. There can be no sixth amendment violation in the absence of prejudice at a particular trial.  Put differently,\nif there is no prejudice, the alleged sixth amendment violation is not merely harmless; there is no violation at all.\nBecause prejudice is an essential element of any sixth amendment violation, sixth amendment claims cannot be\nadjudicated apart from the circumstances of a particular case. Put differently, no claim for relief can be stated in\ngeneral terms as was attempted here. The sixth amendment does not lend itself to a rigid set of rules. For\nexample, \"the Constitution nowhere specifies any period which must intervene between the required appointment\nof counsel and trial....\" Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446, 60 S.Ct. 321, 322, 84 L.Ed. 377 (1940). Although\nplaintiffs allege that delays in the appointment of counsel deny them counsel at \"critical stages\" in the criminal\nprocess, this conclusory allegation fails to identify the \"critical stage\" at which Georgia systematically denies\ncounsel to indigent defendants. This allegation is inadequate and does not put Georgia on notice of the alleged\nunconstitutional conduct. See Frankos v. LaVallee, 535 F.2d 1346 (2d Cir.1976); see also Alfaro Motors, Inc. v.\nWard, 814 F.2d 883, 887 (2d Cir.1987) (\"allegations which are nothing more than broad, simple conclusory\nstatements are insufficient to state a claim under § 1983\"). But even if I assume that the complaint alleges a sixth\namendment violation, I think the panel opinion is wrong.\nThe most troublesome aspect of this case is its disregard for federalism and comity between federal and state\ncourts. The lower federal courts are not and ought not to be the general supervisors of state courts; yet this is\n481 what the complaint seeks. Lower *481 federal courts 00 that is, district and circuit courts 00 can enforce the sixth\n97 97\namendment against the states; but the appropriate enforcement mechanism is post-conviction habeas corpus\nrelief, operating on a case-by-case basis and grounded upon a finding of prejudice.\nThe state defendants contend that \"considerations of federalism alone\" would be enough to justify the district\ncourt's judgment and, in the district court, moved to dismiss per Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (2), and (6). But even if\nabstention has not been asserted expressly, the abstention doctrine is much more than a \"pleader's option.\" See \nZwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 256, 88 S.Ct. 391, 400, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring). The\nSupreme Court, on its own motion, has requested parties to brief the Younger abstention issue and refused to\nabstain only after both parties urged a decision on the constitutional merits. See Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393,\n396 n. 3, 95 S.Ct. 553, 556 n. 3, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975). As stated in Mitchell Family Planning Inc. v. City of Royal\nOak, 335 F.Supp. 738, 740 (E.D.Mich.1972), \"[w]hile defendants have not argued [Younger] abstention, it is a\nmatter which the court must consider when it is requested to act in a manner which may affect the sensitive area\nof federal-state relations.\"\n\nDismissal of the action pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b) is not only supported by precedent, but is mandated by\ncase law of the Supreme Court and of this circuit. For example, in O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669,\n38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974), the Supreme Court upheld the district court's dismissal of the action because plaintiffs\nfailed to present an existing case or controversy and because they stated no adequate basis for equitable relief. \nYounger's principles of federalism and comity prevented the Court from granting the requested relief because the\ninjunction would have been a \"major continuing intrusion\" of federal power into the daily operations of state\ncriminal procedures. The action was thus properly dismissed because it failed to state a claim for which relief\ncould be granted. Defendants have a right to avoid not only the judgment, but the process of defending\nthemselves in federal courts; that is what Rule 12(b) is about. When the potential interference with state courts is\nunacceptable, a 12(b) dismissal is the appropriate reaction. What is said in O'Shea is on point here and\nsummarizes my chief criticism of the panel opinion:\nWhat [plaintiff-respondents] seek is an injunction aimed at controlling or preventing the occurrence\nof specific events that might take place in the course of future state criminal trials. The order the\nCourt of Appeals thought should be available if respondents proved their allegations would be\noperative only where permissible state prosecutions are pending against one or more of the\nbeneficiaries of the injunction. Apparently the order would contemplate interruption of state\nproceedings to adjudicate assertions of noncompliance by petitioners. This seems to us nothing\nless than an ongoing federal audit of state criminal proceedings which would indirectly accomplish\nthe kind of interference that Younger v. Harris and related cases sought to prevent.\n414 U.S. at 500, 94 S.Ct. at 678, 38 L.Ed.2d at 686.\nI know that a panel of this court once in the past granted prospective relief to secure constitutional standards in\nstate criminal proceedings, but that case did not involve sixth amendment ineffectiveness of counsel claims. In \nPugh v. Rainwater, 483 F.2d 778 (5th Cir.1973),rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420\nU.S. 103, 95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975), the Fifth Circuit held that Younger considerations did not preclude\ngranting relief to a class of pre-trial detainees challenging Florida's procedure of pre-trial detention without a\nprobable cause hearing. Rainwater, however, does not support prospective relief for every claim of constitutional\nviolations in state criminal proceedings. The Fifth Circuit wrote, \"[w]e have never intimated that abstention is\nappropriate where there is no state court prosecution to be interfered with and where the plaintiff seeking relief in\n482 federal court has no alternative forum in which to raise his *482 constitutional claim.\" 483 F.2d at 782 (quoting \nMorgan v. Wofford, 472 F.2d 822, 826 (5th Cir.1972)). The court then found that abstention was not required\nbecause the plaintiffs' pre-trial incarceration would have ended as of the time of trial, leaving them with no\nremedy; each claim to a pre-trial preliminary hearing would be mooted by conviction or exoneration.\nLuckey is a different case. Equity need not intervene immediately in plaintiffs' state trials. Plaintiffs have an\nadequate remedy at law for any ineffective assistance of counsel they may actually receive. Most important, they\ncan present objections to sixth amendment violations at their state trials and in their state appeals. \"They [also]\ncan challenge the legality of their custody via federal habeas corpus, subject, of course, to prior exhaustion of\nstate remedies.\" Gardner v. Luckey, 500 F.2d 712, 715 (5th Cir.1974).\nNot only is the panel decision unsupported by Eleventh Circuit precedent, I think it conflicts with prior cases. In \nGardner v. Luckey, a class of defendants asked the court for an injunction ordering the Florida Public Defenders\nOffices to pay higher salaries, provide representation at earlier stages of criminal proceedings, and reduce\ncaseloads of individual attorneys. In affirming the district court's dismissal of the action at the pleading stage,\nJudge Godbold wrote for the panel that \"[t]his case bears a strong resemblance to O'Shea v. Littleton.\" Id. at 714.\n\"It is clear from the face of the complaint that our appellants contemplate exactly the sort of intrusive and\nunworkable supervision of state judicial processes condemned in O'Shea.\" Id. at 715.\nIn Tarter v. Hury, 646 F.2d 1010 (5th Cir.Unit A 1981), the court expressly concluded that the federalism and\ncomity considerations of O'Shea applied to the claim that Galveston County, Texas provided ineffective court-\nappointed counsel. According to the court, \"[g]ranting and enforcing the equitable relief sought by Tarter to\nremedy those alleged improprieties would require the same anticipatory interference condemned in O'Shea.\" Id.\nat 1013 n. 5 (affirming the district court's dismissal of the action before pleadings were served on defendants).\n\nA case similar to Luckey but from another circuit is Wallace v. Kern, 499 F.2d 1345 (2d Cir.1974). The words of\nthe Second Circuit in the context of that speedy trial case seem apt in the context of this effective assistance of\ncounsel case:\nThis is not the proper business of the federal courts, which have no supervisory authority over the\nstate courts and have no power to establish rules of practice for the state courts. Rather, the\nfederal courts must limit their inquiry to the specific facts regarding a complaining petitioner. Relief\nfrom unconstitutional delays in criminal trials is not available in wholesale lots. Whether an\nindividual has been denied his right to a speedy trial must be determined ad hoc on a case-by-\ncase basis.\nId. at 1351.\nIf plaintiffs state a claim for injunctive relief here, federal habeas corpus need not exist. We could simply and\nbroadly enjoin all state court judges to apply the Constitution as we dictate; monitor the state judges'\nperformance; allow criminal defendants in the midst of state proceedings to come to federal court to seek\nenforcement of our injunction; and, if need be, hold state court judges in contempt for not doing as we say. When\nwe embark on this new course, we must prepare to face this unpleasant question: If a state judge does not obey\na district judge's injunction, are we willing to jail the state judge for contempt? Avoidance of this unseemly conflict\nbetween state and federal judges is one reason for O'Shea and Younger.\nIt may well be that Georgia ought to reform the way it finances and otherwise provides counsel to indigent\ndefendants. If reforms are not undertaken, it may well be that more and more state prisoners will have their\nconvictions voided on sixth amendment grounds by state and federal courts. But, for now, this is Georgia's\nbusiness: the business of Georgia's judges, legislators, and voters. While the lower federal courts are protectors\n483 of constitutional *483 rights, that power does not make us the general superintendents of state court systems. I\nthink the panel decision in this case is wrong, and I regret that a whole court has had no chance to study the case\nfully.\nI would grant a rehearing in banc.\n[*] Judge Vance participated in the poll of the court.\n[**] Hon. Thomas E. Scott, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, sitting by designation.\n[1] Our panel discussed only plaintiffs' sixth amendment claims. Therefore, I do not address whether the\ncomplaint may have stated a sufficient claim based on either the eighth amendment or equal protection.\n[2] The Supreme Court has said that in certain limited circumstances prejudice need not be proved but can be\npresumed. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. at 2067. Still, there must be prejudice (proven or\npresumed) in a specific case. Plaintiffs allege none of the circumstances that the Supreme Court has held may\nsupport a presumption of prejudice. Nor do they even allege that Georgia systematically engages in a specific\npractice which they say warrants a presumption of prejudice. Of course, no one claims that indigent defendants in\nGeorgia are regularly tried without counsel.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
