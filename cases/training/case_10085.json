Subsequently, several students and their parents alleged in a civil complaint on 10/21/2002 that the Board's student assignment plan violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause, as well as under Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 703(a) (1), the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and state constitutional and statutory provisions.  The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel.</p><p>District Judge John G. Heyburn grappled with resolving the plaintiffs' case in the wake of then-recent Supreme Court decisions upholding race-conscious admissions policies at a state law school while striking down different race-conscious admissions policies at an undergraduate school on the same campus.  See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003) and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003).  Judge Heyburn observed that the Supreme Court cases set out a requirement that any use of race in a higher education admissions plan must further a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to meet that interest, whereas the case before him involved the different context of an elementary and secondary school student assignment plan.  </p><p>After presiding over a five-day hearing in December 2003, and considering extensive stipulations and exhibits, the judge found on June 29, 2004, that JCPS' managed choice plan met the compelling interest requirement because the district had articulated some of the same reasons for integrated public schools that the Supreme Court upheld in Grutter.  Moreover, the Board described other compelling interests and benefits of integrated schools (such as improved student education and community support for public schools) that were not relevant in the law school context but were relevant to public elementary and secondary schools. The court also found that, in most respects, the JCPS student assignment plan also met the narrow-tailoring requirement. The plan's broad racial guidelines did not constitute a quota and, in the judge's view, avoided the use of race in predominant and unnecessary ways that unduly harmed members of a particular racial group. The Board also used other race neutral means, such as geographic boundaries, special programs and student choice, to achieve racial integration.  Judge Heyburn found, however, that the Board used a student assignment process for the \"traditional\" schools that it operated that was distinct from the process employed at all other programs and schools.  In the traditional schools' assignment process, JCPS separated students into racial categories in a manner that the judge found was completely unnecessary to accomplish its objective of maintaining a fully integrated countywide system of schools.  To the extent the 2001 Plan incorporated racial categorization procedures for assignments to traditional schools, the court concluded that it violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The judge ruled that the Board could continue to administer the 2001 Plan in every respect in all of its schools, with the exception of its use of racial categories in the traditional school assignment process.  McFarland v. Jefferson County Public Schools, 330 F. Supp.2d 834 (W.D. Ky. 2004).  (Footnote 8 of Judge Heyburn's order lists numerous reported decisions he regarded as legal predecessors of his opinion, including one--Hampton v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 72 F. Supp.2d 753 (W.D. Ky. 1999)--which provides a complete legal and historical background of the case.)</p><p>One of the plaintiffs appealed and, on July 25, 2006, the district court's ruling was affirmed in a per curiam decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  416 F.3d 513 (6th Cir. 2006).  That plaintiff, however, petitioned the Supreme Court to issue a writ of certiorari in order to review the Sixth Circuit's affirmance.  On June 5, 2006, the Supreme Court issued the writ and directed that the case and a similar appeal involving public schools in Seattle, WA. were to be considered together.  Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 547 U.S. 1177 (2006).</p><p>In June 2007, the Supreme Court issued its ruling addressing the issues raised in the two cases.  Published as Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 127 S. Ct. 2738, 168 L. Ed. 2d 508 (June 28, 2007), the ruling consists of several parts, with some mustering a 5-4 majority and others only a plurality.  The majority framed the issue as whether a public school system that had not operated legally segregated schools (i.e., Seattle) or that had been found to be unitary (i.e., Jefferson County) may choose to classify students by race and rely upon that classification in making school assignments.  Although the appellate courts had upheld the school systems in each case, the Supreme Court reversed.  After reviewing the operation of the racial classifications used by each school system and ruling that changed circumstances did not deprive it of jurisdiction, the Supreme Court set out the framework it used to evaluate the two cases.  Its' prior cases, in evaluating the use of racial classifications in the school context, recognized two interests that qualified as compelling. The first was the compelling interest of remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination.  This factor could not apply to the Seattle system, which had never engaged in such discrimination, nor to the JCPS system, which had been found to be unitary.   The second government interest recognized as compelling was the interest in diversity in higher education, but only where the racial component of the process is a part of an individualized, holistic consideration process.  Because each system under review relied on racial classifications in a nonindividualized, mechanical way, and because of the different context presented by public elementary and secondary schools in comparison to higher education, the school systems' could not rely on race as they had; Grutter did not govern.  In a portion of his opinion garnering three concurring votes, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the racial classifications employed by the districts were not narrowly tailored to the goal of achieving the educational and social benefits asserted to flow from racial diversity.  In his view of their design and operation, the plans were directed only to racial balance, pure and simple, an objective he said that the Court had repeatedly condemned as illegitimate.  He rejected use of racial balancing as an end in itself and rejected efforts to re-label the practice as racial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, or racial integration.  To the Chief Justice, the Constitution prohibited the states' use of means that treat students solely as members of a racial group, rather than as individuals.  In the following part of his opinion, he noted that both districts asserted the minimal impact of the districts' racial classifications on school enrollment, observing that the assertion casts doubt on the necessity component of assessing governmental use of racial classifications.  Nor had either district shown they seriously considered other, race-neutral methods of achieving their educational goals.  The opinion described what the Chief Justice considered flaws in a lengthy dissent authored by Justice Stephen Breyer.  Justice Stevens also filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion and Justice Kennedy filed a separate opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  The cases were remanded to the Courts of Appeals for further proceedings.</p><p>Subsequently, the Sixth Circuit returned the JCPS case to the district court for further proceedings.  That court's docket sheet reflects that Judge Heyburn held a status conference in early August 2007, and concluded afterward that, based upon the School Board's then-expressed intentions, the Board was in compliance with the Supreme Court's ruling.  The judge noted that plaintiff's counsel stated he would not be seeking any further equitable relief on behalf of plaintiff or any other persons. </p><p>On August 29, 2007, the court responded to a motion for a specific student to be enrolled in the elementary school of the student's choice. Although JCPS had allowed for enrollment prior to the order, the issue had brought the practice of questioning of different attendance zones for black and white students to determine assignments at three traditional magnet elementary schools to the court's attention. The court determined that the practice did not meet the \"narrow tailoring standard\" issued by the Supreme Court in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 334 (2003). JCPS was ordered to discontinue the practice as a result. </p><p>On November 9, 2007, Judge Heyburn ordered an award of $ 200,000 in attorney’s fees and $10,138.02 in expenses. JCPS provided notice of satisfaction of this judgment in December of 2007. </p><p>Two months later, the plaintiffs requested that the case be reopened. On March 11, 2008, the court denied the plaintiff's motion, stating that the plaintiffs was not affected by the new plan and thus had no standing. </p><p>This case is now closed.</p>",

      "text": "Case 3:02-cv-00620-JGH     Document 101      Filed 08/30/2007     Page 1 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY\nAT LOUISVILLE\nCIVIL ACTION NO. 3:02-CV-620-H\nCRYSTAL MEREDITH     PLAINTIFF\nV.\nJEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION, et al.          DEFENDANTS\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nPlaintiff has recently moved to compel the Jefferson County Public Schools (“JCPS”) to\nenroll a specifically named student in the fourth grade at Greathouse-Shyrock Traditional\nElementary School.  The motion raised concerns about the viability of counsel requesting\nspecific relief on behalf of a non-party.  That question and, indeed, the question of the specific\nrelief itself is no longer an issue because JCPS acted quickly to rectify an unusual sequence of\nevents by allowing the student in question to attend Greathouse-Shyrock.  \nThe voluntary resolution of the specific problem, however, did not erase the Court’s\nbroader concern which Plaintiff’s motion has raised.  Yesterday, JCPS confirmed that it has used\ndifferent attendance zones for black and white students to determine assignments at three\ntraditional magnet elementary schools.  The Court heretofore has been unaware of this practice.1 \nConsequently, neither this Court nor the Supreme Court considered whether such a practice\n1 This practice of drawing separate attendance zones for black and white students is at odds with the\nCourt’s prior factual findings and understanding.  See McFarland v. Jefferson County Public Schools, 330 F.Supp.2d\n834, 846-48 (W.D. Ky. 2004) (“each traditional elementary and middle school has its own geographic zone,” clearly\nimplying that each traditional school had one geographic attendance zone applicable equally to all races).  The\noversight or misunderstanding about the elementary school assignment process could have occurred because none of\nPlaintiffs were directly affected by this aspect of the student assignment plan.\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00620-JGH     Document 101      Filed 08/30/2007     Page 2 of 6\nmeets the narrow tailoring standard.2  The Court discussed this and other ongoing issues with the\nparties.  The following amplifies the views this Court articulated yesterday with which all\npresent seemed to consent.\nI.\nNeither this Court nor the Supreme Court has considered the issue of whether dividing\nstudents into separate attendance zones based on race violates the equal protection clause in\nthese circumstances.3  However, such an approach appears to be the functional equivalent of a\nrace based binary selection process, which a solid majority of the current Supreme Court has\nrejected in these circumstances.  Justice Roberts wrote that “classifying and assigning\nschoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of our\nprecedents and our Nation’s history of using race in public schools . . . .”  Parents Involved in\nCmty. Schs., 127 S.Ct. at 2760.  Justice Kennedy, while not so unequivocal, was nevertheless\nequally clear about the concept: absent a showing of necessity not made here, the government is\nnot permitted to “classify every student on the basis of race and to assign each of them to schools\nbased on that classification.”  Id. at 2797 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\nThree years ago, this Court reviewed the traditional school assignment process.  See\nMcFarland., 330 F.Supp.2d at 862-64.  At that time, the Court considered JCPS’s use of an\nassignment process that put black and white applicants on separate assignment tracks and held\n2 When the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications, that\naction is reviewed under strict scrutiny.  Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, et al., 127 S.Ct.\n2738, 2751-52 (2007).  To satisfy this standard of review, the use of racial classifications in the assignment\nprocedure must be “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compelling” government interest.  Id. at 2752.\n3 This is a subject which the Supreme Court did not address directly because this Court had required\nchanges in the traditional school assignment process which neither party contested on appeal.  See McFarland, 330\nF.Supp2d.at 862-864.\n2\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00620-JGH     Document 101      Filed 08/30/2007     Page 3 of 6\nthat such a procedure was not narrowly tailored, because it made race “the defining feature of his\nor her application” and was unnecessary to achieve JCPS’s goals.  Id. at 862 (citing Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 334 (2003)).  In a similar manner, the use of racial attendance zones\nunnecessarily makes race the “defining feature” in an individual student assignment in a binary\nfashion.  Had this Court been aware of and specifically considered the separate attendance zones\nfor traditional schools at the time of its original decision, it likely would have found them\nimproper, even prior to the recent Supreme Court opinion.\nThe Supreme Court’s recent direction on remand crystalizes the analysis and the result.\nSchool boards “are free to devise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general\nway and without treating each student in different fashion solely on the basis of a systematic,\nindividual typing by race.”  Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs., 127 S.Ct. at 2792 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring).  As noted by both this Court and Justice Kennedy, “drawing attendance zones with\ngeneral recognition of the demographics of the neighborhoods” is a permissible means for a\nschool board to further its goal of diversity, because it “[does] not lead to different treatment\nbased on a classification that tells each student he or she is to be defined by race. . . .”  Id. at\n2745 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also McFarland, 330 F.Supp.2d at 864.  \nFor all these reasons, the Court concludes that the use of separate attendance zones for\nblacks and whites is impermissible under the Supreme Court’s recent direction.  Independently,\nJCPS and its counsel appear to have neared the same conclusion.  Based upon JCPS’s\nrepresentation that the McFarland decision properly describes its current student assignment\nplan, this Court would not anticipate any further consideration or review of JCPS’s policies at\nthis time.\n3\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00620-JGH     Document 101      Filed 08/30/2007     Page 4 of 6\nII.\nIt is important to understand a few basic principles that follow the current remand from\nthe United States Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court defined certain conduct which violates the\nEqual Protection Clause in our current circumstances.  It did not require the school system to\nreassign any student nor did it require JCPS to adopt a new assignment plan within any specific\nperiod of time.  No student has an inherent right of assignment to any particular school,\nregardless of its proximity to their residence.  Upon remand, this Court’s immediate concern was\nthat JCPS cease any unconstitutional use of race as part of its current student assignment process. \nFor that purpose, this Court convened a hearing on August 2, 2007.  At that time, all parties\ndiscussed the current situation and agreed that JCPS was in compliance with the Supreme\nCourt’s decision.4  The hearing yesterday, as amplified in the initial section of the instant\nMemorandum Opinion, hopefully has resolved a final uncertainty about JCPS’s obligations\ngoing forward. \nOne might ask why this Court does not require some sort of immediate retroactive\nremedy or relief such as the Supreme Court required in 1955 after Brown and such as the late\nJudge James Gordon ordered in 1973.  There are several good reasons why.  First, none of the\nPlaintiffs here have requested any specific relief on remand, other than a request for damages by\nthe Meredith family.  Furthermore, no other non-party has requested additional relief arising\nfrom the Supreme Court’s remand.5  As in the previous case contesting the student assignment\n4 This conclusion was based upon JCPS’s representation that it was no longer using race or the racial\nguidelines as a factor in the assignment of specific students to a school or as a factor in the consideration of student\ntransfer requests. \n5 Whether a particular student has any legal ground to require retroactive reassignment to a particular\nschool is also quite problematic and, in any event, can only be determined after a request and an examination of the\n4\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00620-JGH     Document 101      Filed 08/30/2007     Page 5 of 6\nplan, the foremost concern of the parties and the Court has been to assure ongoing conduct\nconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause.  \nSecond, neither the remand of the Supreme Court nor the Sixth Circuit required or even\nsuggested such relief because the circumstances are so unlike those in 1955 and 1973.  In those\ninstances, unconstitutional acts over many years resulted in an unconstitutional condition.  That\nis the segregation of races by law.  In 1955 or 1973, our courts found that an entire class of\ncitizens identified by race were discriminated against and segregated.  As a consequence, the\nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals required Judge Gordon to immediately “formulate a\ndesegregation plan” to eliminate the effects of past segregation.  To be sure, the Supreme Court\nhas clarified that JCPS has improperly used race conscious assignment procedures.  However,\nthose procedures did not create an unconstitutional condition, such as the forced racial\nsegregation of students.\nConsequently, when JCPS ended the offending conduct as this Court has required, the\nprimary and appropriate remedy is achieved.  This Court does not anticipate further action in this\ncase other than resolving Plaintiff’s pending motions for attorney’s fees and damages.\nBeing otherwise sufficiently advised, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff’s motion for specific relief is DENIED AS\nMOOT.  JCPS has indicated its intention to follow the guidance set out herein.\nparticular circumstances.  Indeed, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that he would not seek further equitable relief on behalf\nof other persons under the current circumstances.\n5\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00620-JGH     Document 101      Filed 08/30/2007     Page 6 of 6\ncc: Counsel of Record\n6",

Metzmeier, Louisville, KY, for Kentucky Commission on Human Rights.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nHEYBURN, Chief Judge.\nFor twenty-five years, the Jefferson County Public Schools (\"JCPS\" or \"the Board\") maintained an integrated\nschool system under a 1975 federal court decree. After release from that decree four years ago, the JCPS\nelected to continue its integrated schools through a managed choice plan that includes broad racial guidelines\n(\"the 2001 Plan\"). This case arises because some students and their parents say that the Board's student\n[1]\nassignment plan violates their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.\n[2]\nThe occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education  has generated much discussion\nregarding whether that ruling has fulfilled its original promise. To give all students the benefits of an education in a\nracially integrated school and to maintain community commitment to the entire school system precisely express\nthe Board's own vision of Brown's promise. The benefits the JCPS hopes to achieve go to the heart of its\neducational mission: (1) a better academic education for all students; (2) better appreciation of our political and\ncultural heritage for all students; (3) more competitive and attractive public schools; and (4) broader community\nsupport for all JCPS schools.\n837 One half a century of social change after Brown, the constitutional questions the *837 federal courts confront are\nderivative of but dramatically different from those addressed in Brown. This case raises one of those questions:\nto what extent does the Equal Protection Clause limit JCPS's discretion to use race-conscious policies to\nmaintain an integrated public school system. The Supreme Court has yet to consider this question directly.\nI.\nSUMMARY\nThis case has required the Court to weigh individual rights under the Equal Protection Clause against the\nresponsibility and right of an elected public school board to determine its own educational policies. For guidance,\nthe Court has focused on the divided opinions of the Supreme Court in two recent cases: Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\n\nU.S. 306, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003), and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 123 S.Ct. 2411, 156\nL.Ed.2d 257 (2003). The first of these opinions upheld race-conscious admissions policies at the University of\nMichigan Law School; the latter struck down different policies at the University of Michigan's College of Literature,\nScience and the Arts. These two cases set out the requirement that any use of race in a higher education\nadmissions plan must further a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to meet that\ninterest. The Court considered these principles in the slightly different context of an elementary and secondary\nschool student assignment plan.\nJCPS meets the compelling interest requirement because it has articulated some of the same reasons for\nintegrated public schools that the Supreme Court upheld in Grutter. Moreover, the Board has described other\ncompelling interests and benefits of integrated schools, such as improved student education and community\nsupport for public schools, that were not relevant in the law school context but are relevant to public elementary\nand secondary schools.\nIn most respects, the JCPS student assignment plan also meets the narrow tailoring requirement. Its broad racial\nguidelines do not constitute a quota. The Board avoids the use of race in predominant and unnecessary ways\nthat unduly harm members of a particular racial group. The Board also uses other race-neutral means, such as\ngeographic boundaries, special programs and student choice, to achieve racial integration.\nThe student assignment process for the traditional schools is distinct from that employed at all other programs\nand schools. In that process, JCPS separates students into racial categories in a manner that appears\ncompletely unnecessary to accomplish its objectives. To the extent the 2001 Plan incorporates these procedures,\nthe Court concludes that it violates the Equal Protection Clause. The Board may continue to administer the 2001\nPlan in every respect in all of its schools, with the exception of its use of racial categories in the traditional school\nassignment process.\nII.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs all have children who attend or have attended Jefferson County public schools and have participated in\nthe student assignment process. Each, in different ways, is dissatisfied with the procedure or result of his or her\n838 child's assignment to a Jefferson County public school.[3] Plaintiffs *838 seek to enjoin the use of racial\nguidelines under the 2001 Plan, including the use of racial categories in the traditional school assignment\nprocess. This Court has stated that, because the student assignment plan applies at all grade levels in all school\nsettings in the Jefferson County schools, any ruling would necessarily apply to the entire school system.\nThe JCPS Board is composed of seven members elected by district for terms of four years. The Board manages\nand controls JCPS. The Board is a corporate body which is organized and exists pursuant to KRS § 160.160. It\nhas the powers and duties stated in KRS § 160.290 and other applicable statutes. The Board selects a\nsuperintendent, who acts as the chief administrative officer of JCPS. Defendant Stephen Daeschner is the\nSuperintendent of JCPS.\nThis Court conducted a five-day hearing in December 2003. Prior to this hearing, the parties entered into a 135-\n839 paragraph stipulation that included 75 exhibits. At the hearing, several Plaintiffs testified *839 about their\n[4]\nexperiences with the JCPS student assignment plan.  Defendants called the superintendent, several board\nmembers, numerous administrative staff members, principals and educational experts, who provided testimony\nabout all aspects of the JCPS student assignment plan, the traditional program, the student population and the\n[5]\nimportance of a racially integrated education.\n\nA.\nJCPS is the 28th largest public school system in the United States. Its district boundaries mirror those of the new\nMetropolitan Louisville which is now the 16th largest city in the nation. In 2003-2004, about 97,000 students were\nenrolled in JCPS: approximately 5,000 in preschool programs; 42,500 in elementary schools; 21,650 in middle\n840 schools; 24,750 in high schools; 2,100 in alternative schools; and about 1,000 in special schools and special \n*840 education centers. The racial profile of students subject to the 2001 Plan is about 34% Black and 66%\n[6]\nWhite.\n[7]\nJCPS offers a full array of comprehensive, specialized and advanced programs throughout its schools.  It\noperates pre-school and grades Primary 1 (\"kindergarten\") through grade five in its 87 elementary schools, sixth\ngrade through the eighth grade in its 23 middle schools, and ninth grade through twelfth grade in its 20 high\nschools. It also operates the Brown School, which contains all grade levels in one building, as well as several\nalternative schools and special education centers. Each school building has a program capacity, which is the\nnumber of students that the building can accommodate, consistent with the programs offered there. JCPS\nallocates operating funds to each school using the same formula that is uniformly applied to all JCPS schools.\nThe Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990 (\"KERA\") sets out many requirements for curriculum development,\neducational goals and assessment requirements for all Kentucky schools, including JCPS. KERA requires each\nschool to form a School-Based Decision Making Council (\"SBDM council\" or \"Council\") composed of parents,\nteachers and the school's principal or administrator. Each Council determines which textbooks, instructional\nmaterials and student support services will be used at its school. It also adopts policies for various aspects of\nschool life.\nKERA requires a statewide assessment program known as the Commonwealth Accountability Testing System\n(\"CATS\"). This test measures core academic content, basic skills, and higher-order thinking skills and their\napplication. KERA requires that JCPS and SBDM councils identify achievement gaps between various groups of\nstudents, including between Black and White students, and between Free and Reduced Lunch (\"FRL\") students\nand non-FRL students. JCPS sets biennial targets for eliminating those achievement gaps.\nB.\n[8]\nThis case and its legal predecessors  are inseparable from JCPS's ongoing commitment to racial integration\n841 within its individual schools. One can find the complete *841 legal and historical background of this case in \nHampton I, 72 F.Supp.2d 753, 754-67 (W.D.Ky.1999). A brief description follows.\nIn 1973, parents and students filed two federal lawsuits against the Board and the former Louisville Board of\nEducation, alleging that each maintained a segregated school system and demanding desegregation of those\nschools (collectively, the \"Haycraft\" case). In December 1973, on appeal from dismissal of both lawsuits, the\nSixth Circuit directed Judge James Gordon to devise a student assignment plan that eliminated all vestiges of\nstate-imposed segregation in the two school systems. Newburg Area Council, Inc. v. Bd. of Educ. of Jefferson\nCounty, 489 F.2d 925, 932 (6th Cir.1973). In July 1975, Judge Gordon approved such a plan, and the then-\nexisting Board implemented it. By December 1981, Judge Gordon ended his direct monitoring of schools. In April\n1984, the Board approved the first significant modification of its student assignment plan.\nOver the next decade, the Board gradually increased specialized educational offerings and encouraged students\nto make voluntary school choices. In August 1996, after receiving advice from consultants, various committees\nand a public opinion survey, the Board again revised its student assignment plan. In April 1998, students and\nparents filed a lawsuit alleging that the students were denied admission to Central High School due to their race.\nIn June 1999, this Court concluded that Judge Gordon's original Haycraft desegregation decree was still in effect.\nHampton I, 72 F.Supp.2d at 774. Plaintiffs then moved to dissolve that decree.\n\nIn June 2000, this Court dissolved the 1975 desegregation decree, ordered JCPS to cease using racial quotas at\nCentral High School, and ordered JCPS to complete any reevaluation and redesign of the admissions procedures\nin other magnet schools before the beginning of the 2002-2003 school year. Hampton II, 102 F.Supp.2d 358,\n[9]\n377-81 (W.D.Ky.2000).\nTo comply with the Court's order, the Board ended its use of racial quotas at Central High School and at three\nother magnet schools, duPont Manual High School (including the Youth Performing Arts School (\"YPAS\")), the\nBrown School, and Brandeis Elementary. The Board determined that the Court's order did not address the use of\nrace at magnet traditional schools. In April 2001, after considering public feedback from opinion surveys and\ncommunity meetings, the Board adopted the 2001 Plan.\nIII.\nTHE 2001 STUDENT ASSIGNMENT PLAN\nNotwithstanding many changes and refinements to its assignment plans over the past twenty-five years, the\n842 Board's primary *842 objective has remained constant: to maintain a fully integrated countywide system of\nschools. The 2001 Plan contains three basic organizing principles: (1) management of broad racial guidelines, (2)\ncreation of school boundaries or \"resides\" areas and elementary school clusters, and (3) maximization of student\nchoice through magnet schools, magnet traditional schools, magnet and optional programs, open enrollment and\ntransfers. Using these principles, JCPS provides a form of managed choice in student assignment for its students\nindividually and for the system as a whole.\nA.\nThe racial guidelines broadly influence the overall student assignment plan. This is not surprising since one of the\nBoard's current stated goals under the 2001 Plan is to provide \"substantially uniform educational resources to all\nstudents\" and to teach basic skills and critical thinking skills \"in a racially integrated environment.\" To accomplish\nthese objectives, the 2001 Plan requires each school to seek a Black student enrollment of at least 15% and no\nmore than 50%. This reflects a broad range equally above and below Black student enrollment systemwide.\nPrior to any consideration of a student's race, a myriad of other factors, such as place of residence, school\ncapacity, program popularity, random draw and the nature of the student's choices, will have a more significant\neffect on school assignment. The guidelines mostly influence student assignment in subtle and indirect ways. For\ninstance, where the racial composition of an entire school lies near either end of the racial guidelines, the\napplication of any student for open enrollment, transfer or even to a magnet program could be affected. In a\nspecific case, a student's race, whether Black or White, could determine whether that student receives his or her\nfirst, second, third or fourth choice of school.\nFor the most part, the guidelines provide administrators with the authority to facilitate, negotiate and collaborate\nwith principals and staff to maintain schools within the 15-50% range. The Court will discuss the actual\nassignment process in greater detail in Sections III.D and III.E of this Memorandum.\nB.\nGeographic boundaries greatly influence student assignments. Each JCPS school, except Central, duPont\nManual and YPAS, Male and Butler high schools, the Brown School, Brandeis Elementary, and the traditional\nprograms at Foster and Maupin, has a designated geographic attendance area, which is called its \"resides area.\"\nEach student is assigned a \"resides school\" based upon the residence address of his or her parent(s) or\n[10]\nguardian. In 2002-2003, 57.5% of all students attended their resides school.\n\nAt the elementary school level, all non-magnet elementary schools are grouped into twelve clusters. The\nelementary schools in a cluster, which includes a student's resides school, are designated as \"cluster resides\nschools\" for that student. Racial demographics have influenced the boundaries for contiguous and non-\ncontiguous resides areas and the composition of some elementary school clusters. Elementary schools are\nclustered so that combined attendance zones, assuming normal voluntary choices, will produce at each school\nstudent populations somewhere within the racial guidelines.\n843 *843 Each non-magnet middle and high school has its own resides area. There are no clusters at those levels.\nApart from age, graduation from previous grade and residence, no selection criteria govern admission of any\nstudent to his or her resides school or a school within his or her cluster. The geographic boundaries of resides\nareas and cluster schools determine most school assignments.\nC.\nStudent choice may be the most significant element of the 2001 Plan. In addition to a choice of geographic\nlocation, JCPS offers students the choice of numerous and varied specialized schools and programs. The basic\nsettings of specialized curriculum are: (1) magnet schools, (2) magnet and optional programs, and (3) magnet\ncareer academies. Differences abound, even within these broad groupings. Virtually all age appropriate students\nmay apply for admission to any of these specialized programs.\nJCPS has created thirteen magnet schools. Non-traditional magnet schools do not have a resides area. Any\nstudent, regardless of address, may apply to the four non-traditional magnet schools: Brandeis Elementary,\nduPont Manual (including YPAS), Central, and Brown. These schools offer specialized programs and curricula.\nThe remaining nine magnets are traditional schools that offer regular curriculum in a particular school\nenvironment. Although students may only apply to a particular traditional school based on place of residence\n(except for Butler, Male, and the traditional programs at Foster and Maupin), traditional schools are not resides\nschools for any student because all students must apply for entry.\n[11]\nThe Board has created eighteen magnet programs.  These are small, specialized programs within a regular\n[12]\nschool. The Board has also created optional programs in twenty-two schools.  These are small, specialized\nprograms with unique characteristics. A student may apply for admission to any magnet or optional program\n[13]\nregardless of his or her resides area.\nMagnet career academies are high schools that offer programs focusing on a specific technical career. Students\nmust apply to the magnet program at a magnet career academy. The Board has designated thirteen resides high\n[14]\nschools, plus Central, as magnet career academies.  Except in the case of Central, which has a unique\ncurriculum and is open to students countywide, the majority of students enrolled in a magnet career academy live\nin that school's resides area.\n844 *844 An important part of student choice is the ability of virtually any student to apply for open enrollment (high\nschool freshmen only) or transfer to any non-magnet school. The process for each is similar. After the initial\n[15]\nassignment process is complete, any student may apply for transfer to any non-magnet school.  Rising\nfreshmen may apply for open enrollment to any non-magnet high school. If the student is accepted, the receiving\nschool becomes the student's resides school. In each case, the receiving school makes the original decision to\naccept or reject the applicant. The number of students actually requesting transfer or open enrollment is quite\n[16]\nsmall.\nD.\nSchool geographic boundaries and student choice interact to create a huge array of choices and flexibility within\nthe assignment process.\n\nAt the Primary 1 (or kindergarten) level, a student is assigned to his or her resides school unless that school\nlacks capacity or the student applies for another school. The racial guidelines do not apply to kindergarten.\nAn elementary school student has as many as five choices. Normally, that student is assigned to his or her\nresides school unless that school exceeds its capacity or hovers at the extreme ends of the racial guidelines\n(except for kindergarten), or the student has been accepted to another school or program in or out of the resides\n[17]\ncluster.  All parents of incoming kindergarten students, first graders or new elementary school students may\nselect a first and second choice school within their resides cluster and a first and second choice magnet or\noptional program, including a traditional school. Students may list a traditional school only as a first choice\nmagnet program. A student may exercise his or her choices in each successive year.\nThe principals in each cluster and JCPS administrators jointly determine elementary school assignments based\nupon student choices, the available space and the racial guidelines. If the student is unhappy with the\nassignment, the student may request a transfer to another elementary school, in or out of the cluster. Acceptance\n845 by *845 transfer depends upon the racial guidelines and program capacity. If a student submits no application,\nthen the student is assigned to a school within his or her resides cluster depending upon capacity and the racial\nguidelines. Only a small number of elementary students receive an assignment that is not one of their choices.\n[18]\nAt the middle school level, students have three choices. Most students choose to attend their resides school, for\nwhich the only selection criteria are graduation from an elementary school and place of residence. A student may\nalso apply for a first and second choice magnet middle school or magnet or optional program. Regardless of\nacceptance to a magnet program, a student may choose to attend either his or her resides school or select a\nthird option, which is to apply for a transfer to another middle school.\nAt the high school level, students have the same basic three choices. Most high school students choose to attend\ntheir resides school for which the only selection criteria are middle school graduation and place of residence.\nStudents may also apply for a first and second choice magnet high school or optional or magnet program. Rising\nfreshmen may also apply for open enrollment to any non-magnet high school of their choice. If a student is\naccepted to a high school through open enrollment, that high school becomes the student's resides school.\nRegardless of acceptance to a magnet program, a student may choose to attend either his or her resides school\nor select a third option, which is to apply for a transfer to another high school.\nThe admissions process for non-traditional magnet schools, magnet programs and optional programs at all grade\n[19]\nlevels is relatively straightforward. Admissions decisions for the four non-traditional magnet schools  are based\nupon: (1) objective criteria established by the school or program, such as a survey and/or essay,\nrecommendations by adults, a work sample or audition, attendance data, course grades and CATS and/or\nstandardized test scores; (2) available space in the school or program; and (3) for students applying to Brown,\nposition on a computer-generated random draw list and residence within a zip code that will make the student\nbody representative of the entire county. In addition to objective criteria and program capacity, the racial\nguidelines are a factor in admission to all the other magnet and optional programs. Admission to one of the\nmiddle school Math, Science and Technology Programs is also based upon position on a computer-generated\nrandom draw list.\nE.\nTraditional schools have a more complex admissions process, which combines elements of student choice,\nprogram and school capacity, geographic boundaries, pure chance, broad racial guidelines and the use of racial\ncategories to separate applicants. Some Plaintiffs initiated this litigation because they object to JCPS's use of the\nracial guidelines in general, and the use of racial categories in particular, in the traditional school admissions\nprocess.\nJCPS first developed traditional programs for the 1976-1977 school year. Traditional schools offer the same\n846 comprehensive *846 curriculum offered by every other non-magnet school. These schools emphasize basic skills\n\nin a highly structured educational environment, discipline and dress codes, learning with daily follow-up\nassignments, and concepts of courtesy, patriotism, morality and respect for others. Parents are expected to\nmonitor their children's school work, to support their children's academic and extracurricular activities, and to be\ninvolved in the school PTA.\nThe traditional program is offered as the sole structure at nine schools: four elementary, three middle and two\n[20]\nhigh schools.  In addition, JCPS offers the traditional program at two resides elementary schools, Foster and\n[21]\nMaupin.  In 2002-2003, about 9.3% of all JCPS students were enrolled in the traditional program. Application\nto the traditional program at Foster and Maupin is open to students districtwide. Students apply to the other\ntraditional schools based on place of residence (except at Butler and Male). The traditional schools, including\nFoster and Maupin, admit students only by application. They do not accept students based on transfer or high\nschool open enrollment applications. In response to the increasing popularity of the traditional school setting,\n[22]\neight other resides schools now offer this learning environment to their students.\n1.\nPlace of residence and position on the random draw lists are the primary factors for entry into the traditional\nprogram. With the exception of the programs at Foster and Maupin, which are open to students districtwide, each\ntraditional elementary and middle school has its own geographic zone. Students attend the traditional school in\ntheir geographic zone. After initial acceptance, the so-called \"pipeline\" becomes the dominant influence in\ntraditional school assignment. The \"pipeline\" guarantees each current traditional school student a spot in the next\ngrade level without submitting a new application. The \"pipeline\" enlarges in each grade, thus creating openings\nfor new applicants to the traditional program.\nThe traditional program begins in kindergarten. At this grade level, the four traditional elementary schools have a\n[23]\ntotal of 360 openings (96 at each school, except 72 at Schaffner).  These students form the first stage of the\n847 traditional program \"pipeline.\" The \"pipeline\" increases by twenty-four students at the first grade level. *847 The\n\"pipeline\" increases by sixty-four students at the fourth grade level and by sixteen students at the fifth grade level,\ndue to increases in the pupil to teacher ratio. After the four traditional elementary schools have filled all their\navailable spaces, Foster and Maupin send letters to the parents of student applicants who were not accepted,\noffering them the opportunity to apply to those traditional magnet programs. Foster and Maupin also accept\nadditional students to their traditional program between the first and fifth grades. Students who attend Foster and\nMaupin become part of the traditional school \"pipeline\" and therefore gain the right to attend a traditional middle\nschool.\nMiddle schools are larger than elementary schools. Consequently, the \"pipeline\" increases by about 450 students\nat the sixth grade level and by sixty students at the seventh grade level. About 800 students graduate from the\nthree traditional middle schools. These students can state a preference to attend either Butler or Male. The two\ntraditional high schools have available space for 946 ninth graders, 446 at Butler and 500 at Male. Currently,\nmost middle school students choose Male, so that school usually has no spots available for new applicants. On\nthe other hand, Butler typically has about 200 openings for students outside the traditional school \"pipeline.\"\nConsequently, students not in the \"pipeline\" may apply for Butler. Their applications are considered to the extent\nspace is available.\nStudents who are not accepted to a traditional school have other opportunities to join the \"pipeline.\" For instance,\na student may elect to apply to the traditional programs at Foster or Maupin. Plaintiff David McFarland's son,\nDaniel McFarland, chose not to accept his offer to attend Maupin. Students may also reapply each year. Two\nstudents in this case, Stephen and Daniel McFarland, applied a second time, and each was accepted to a\ntraditional school. Neither Brandon Pittenger nor Kenneth Aubrey, the other two children challenging the\ntraditional school assignment plan, chose to reapply to a traditional school.\n\n2.\nThe racial guidelines also apply to the traditional schools. The process for employing the guidelines, however, is\nsignificantly different from the process as it is applied to all other schools. Applicants are separated and randomly\nsorted into four lists at each grade level: Black Male, Black Female, White Male and White Female.\nThe principal has discretion to draw candidates from different lists in order to stay within the racial guidelines for\nthe entire school student population. The racial guidelines apply to the entire school, not per grade. Generally\n[24]\nspeaking, depending on how many spaces are available for new applicants,  a principal will first take a certain\nnumber of applicants from each list 00 for instance, the first ten names on each list 00 and notify the parents. If the\n97 97\nparent declines to enroll the child in that school, the principal can now move to the next name on one of the four\nlists, using his or her discretion as to which list to choose from. If all of the parents accept, depending upon space\navailability, the selection process may be complete or may require selection of a few more students. The Office of\nDemographics gives final approval on a principal's selections to ensure that the school is within the racial\nguidelines.\n848 *848 A principal may not deviate from the order in which the names appear on the lists. If a principal has chosen\nall the names on a given list, he or she is not permitted to recruit additional applicants for that race/gender\ncategory. Similarly, if few or no Black students apply to a traditional school, a principal would be limited to\nadmitting only those Black students who apply at that time. JCPS, however, makes a concerted effort through the\nParent Assistance Center and the Department of Student Assignment to ensure adequate Black student\n[25]\nparticipation in the traditional program.\nIV.\nTHE STANDARD OF REVIEW\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution provides that no state shall \"deny to any person\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. While everyone agrees that\nany government action based on race is subject to thorough judicial inquiry, some dispute the exact nature of that\ninquiry. This Court concludes that the Supreme Court has unequivocally established that \"all racial classifications\nreviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.\" Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 270,\n123 S.Ct. 2411, 156 L.Ed.2d 257 (2003) (quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 224, 115\nS.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S.\n306, 326, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003).\nThe Supreme Court first stated this view in Korematsu v. United States, where it found all racial classifications to\nbe \"immediately suspect\" and subject to \"the most rigid scrutiny.\" 323 U.S. 214, 216, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194\n(1944). In virtually every case since then, in a broad variety of circumstances and despite repeated entreaties to\nreverse itself, the Supreme Court has applied the same standard. See, e.g., Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326, 123 S.Ct.\n2325; Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270, 123 S.Ct. 2411; Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S.Ct.\n2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995) (invalidating a federal government contract program giving preference to\nbusinesses owned by racial minorities); City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493, 109 S.Ct. 706,\n102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (plurality opinion) (invalidating municipal program requiring all contractors to subcontract\nat least 30% of each contract to minority-owned businesses); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267,\n273, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986) (invalidating teacher layoff policy that granted racial preferences in\nmaking layoff decisions); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967) (outlawing\nstate anti-miscegenation statute); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954)\n(outlawing de jure racial segregation in the District of Columbia public school system). Most recently, in Grutter\nand Gratz, the Supreme Court explicitly reaffirmed strict scrutiny for review of racial classifications in higher\n[26]\neducation admissions programs.\n\nSeveral lower courts have suggested that some form of intermediate scrutiny might be more appropriate when\n849 examining the constitutionality of certain affirmative *849 action plans promoting racial integration in housing and\n[27]\namong students and teachers in public schools.  While the present case is distinguishable in many respects\nfrom the Supreme Court's most recent decisions in Grutter and Gratz, the Supreme Court has always chosen\n[28]\nstrict scrutiny as the proper standard of review for racial classifications.  Given our inherent suspicion of racial\ncategories, the utmost level of scrutiny is required.\nThis Court will therefore apply strict scrutiny to the JCPS student assignment plan.\nV.\nJCPS HAS ESTABLISHED A COMPELLING INTEREST IN\nMAINTAINING INTEGRATED SCHOOLS\nStrict scrutiny means that racial classifications must further a compelling governmental interest and must be\nnarrowly tailored to meet that interest. Absent searching judicial inquiry, one cannot determine \"what\nclassifications are `benign' or `remedial' and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of\nracial inferiority or simple racial politics.\" Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting J.A. Croson Co., 488\nU.S. at 493, 109 S.Ct. 706). Strict scrutiny of all racial classifications will \"`smoke out' illegitimate uses of race by\nassuring that [the government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.\" Id.\nThe Supreme Court has said that universities and graduate schools may state a compelling interest in obtaining\n\"the educational benefits of a diverse student body.\" Id. at 328, 123 S.Ct. 2325. The Board's interests articulated\nhere overlap with those of the Michigan Law School at the individual student level. In addition, in its statement of\ninterests, the Board has articulated broader concerns in the different context of public elementary and secondary\n[29]\neducation.  The different context \"matters\" because, under the Equal Protection Clause, \"[n]ot every decision\ninfluenced by race is equally objectionable and strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully\n850 examining the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker *850 for\nthe use of race in that particular context.\" Id. at 327, 123 S.Ct. 2325. No particular interest, however, is\ncategorically compelling. The interest asserted must be examined and approved in each case in light of the\nparticular context in which it is asserted.\nWhether an asserted interest is truly compelling is revealed only by assessing the objective validity of the goal, its\nimportance to JCPS and the sincerity of JCPS's interest. For the reasons that follow, the Court has no doubt that\nDefendants have proven that their interest in having integrated schools is compelling by any definition.\nA.\nTraditionally, Americans consider the education of their children a matter of intense personal and local concern.\nNot surprisingly, over many years and in a variety of circumstances, the Supreme Court has strongly endorsed\nthe role and importance of local elected school boards as they craft educational policies for their communities. \nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 489-90, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992); Bd. of Educ. of Okla. City Pub.\nSchs. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248, 111 S.Ct. 630, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991); Wash. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1,\n458 U.S. 457, 481-82, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982); Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406,\n410, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 741-42, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d\n1069 (1974); San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 49-51, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).\n[30]\n The historical importance of the deference accorded to local school boards goes to the very heart of our\ndemocratic form of government. It is conceptually different 00 though perhaps more accepted 00 than the\n97 97\n[31]\ndeference discussed in Grutter and Bakke.\n851\n\n*851 Democratically elected school boards across the country are struggling to improve our schools and the\neducation of children in them and to retain the public support of their communities. The Court's deference to\nJCPS's efforts here is neither absolute nor determinative. Rather, offering deference is consistent with the\nBoard's acknowledged responsibilities and complements the basic concepts of democracy. In a different age and\nunder quite different circumstances, the Sixth Circuit observed that\nit is the wiser course to allow for the flexibility, imagination and creativity of local school boards in\nproviding for equal opportunity in education for all students.... [T]here may be a variety of\npermissible means to the goal of equal opportunity, and that room for reasonable men of good will\nto solve these complex community problem[s] must be preserved.\nDeal v. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ., 11 Ohio Misc. 184, 369 F.2d 55, 61 (6th Cir.1966). The same advice makes\nsense today in the aftermath of JCPS's long period of court-ordered integration.\nIndeed, the Board has earned at least a small measure of the Court's respect as it chooses the method of\norganizing the community's schools. This Court addressed this very theme in Hampton II:\nIf JCPS voluntarily chooses to maintain desegregated schools, it acts with the traditional authority\ninvested in a democratically elected school board:\n`School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement\neducational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in\na pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students\nreflecting the proportion of the district as a whole. To do this as an educational policy is within the\nbroad discretionary powers of school authorities ....'\n102 F.Supp.2d at 379 (quoting Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28\nL.Ed.2d 554 (1971)). Viewing voluntary school integration as an extension of the Supreme Court's school\ndesegregation jurisprudence makes sense. In 1975, an integrated school system and all the benefits it promised\nwere thought so essential that various federal courts required JCPS to create and maintain it. Over the years\nmuch has changed. As many school systems escape the mandate of desegregation decrees, they face for the\nfirst time a choice of direction. It would seem rather odd that the concepts of equal protection, local control and\nlimited deference are now only one-way streets to a particular educational policy, virtually prohibiting the\n[32]\nvoluntary continuation of policies once required by law.\n852 *852 While some deference is due JCPS in the exercise of its policy choices, the arguments favoring the Board's\ncompelling interest are so objectively overwhelming that deference is immaterial to the result here.\nB.\nNow removed from the mandate of a federal court decree, the Board has made its choice. This Court must\nconsider the importance and validity of that choice.\nIntegrated schools, better academic performance, appreciation for our diverse heritage and stronger, more\ncompetitive public schools are consistent with central values and themes of American culture. Access to equal\nand integrated schools has been an important national ethic ever since Brown v. Board of Education established\n[33]\nwhat Richard Kluger described as \"nothing short of a reconsecration of American ideals.\"  What Kluger and\nothers have articulated is that Brown's symbolic, moral and now historic significance may now far exceed its\nstrictly legal importance. Alluding to that very point, this Court has said that \"Brown and its progeny established a\nmoral imperative to eradicate racial injustice in the public schools.\" Hampton II, 102 F.Supp.2d at 379. Congress\nrecently affirmed the value of racial integration and interaction by its enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act\n[34]\nand by the statements contained in that legislation. See 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq.  Likewise, the Supreme\nCourt has reiterated that \"education ... is the very foundation of good citizenship.\" Grutter, 539 U.S. at 331, 123\nS.Ct. 2325 (quoting Brown, 347 U.S. at 493, 74 S.Ct. 686).\n\nNeither Congress's statements nor Supreme Court references are proof that a policy of school integration is a\ncompelling goal. They do reinforce, however, the notion that Brown's original moral and constitutional declaration\nhas survived to become a mainstream value of American education and that the Board's interests are entirely\nconsistent with these traditional American values. They reinforce our intuitive sense that education is about a lot\nmore than just the \"three-R's.\"\nFor the majority in Grutter, cross-racial understanding and racial tolerance, preparation for a diverse workplace\nand training of the nation's future leaders were \"substantial\" benefits of diversity in higher education. Id. at\n330-32, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Like institutions of higher education, elementary and secondary schools are \"pivotal to\n853 `sustaining our political and cultural *853 heritage' with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society.\" Id.\nat 331, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982)). For\n[35]\nthat reason, these same benefits accrue to students in racially integrated public schools.  Several JCPS\nwitnesses testified that, in a racially integrated learning environment, students learn tolerance towards others\nfrom different races, develop relationships across racial lines and relinquish racial stereotypes. These values\ntranscend their experiences in public school and carry over to their relationships in college and in the workplace.\nAs a result, these students are better prepared for jobs in a diverse workplace and exhibit greater social and\nintellectual maturity with their peers in the classroom and at their job. These benefits that the Board seeks from\nan integrated school system are precisely those articulated and approved of in Grutter. The Court finds that the\nbenefits of racial tolerance and understanding are equally as \"important and laudable\" in public elementary and\n[36]\nsecondary education as in higher education. Id. at 330, 123 S.Ct. 2325.\nOther benefits the Board seeks are quite different from those articulated in Grutter. Nevertheless, they seem\nequally compelling. The Board believes that integration has produced educational benefits for students of all\nraces. Over the past twenty-five years, White and Black students in JCPS have progressed by every measure. In \nHampton II, this Court found that \"the Board is convinced that integrated schools provide a better educational\nsetting for all its students; [and] that concentrations of poverty which may arise in neighborhood schools are\nmuch more likely to adversely affect black students than whites.\" 102 F.Supp.2d at 371 n. 30. The evidence\npresented in this and earlier cases \"seems to suggest that African-American student achievement has improved\nsubstantially\" during the past twenty-five years. Id. at 365 n. 12. Indeed, one of Defendants' experts testified that\nracial integration benefits Black students substantially in terms of academic achievement. The Court cannot be\ncertain to what extent the policy of an integrated school system has contributed to these successes. Opinions\n854 surely vary on this issue.[37] The Court certainly need not resolve this ongoing debate. But, *854 the Fourteenth\n[38]\nAmendment does not enact any particular preference of educational policy.  As a matter of evidence, however,\nthis Court can find that the Board has valid reasons for believing that its student assignment policies may aid\n[39]\nstudent performance.\nThe Board also believes that school integration benefits the system as a whole by creating a system of roughly\nequal components, not one urban system and another suburban system, not one rich and another poor, not one\nBlack and another White. It creates a perception, as well as the potential reality, of one community of roughly\nequal schools. Student choice and integrated schools, the Board believes, invest parents and students alike with\na sense of participation and a positive stake in their schools and the school system as a whole. This is vital to\nJCPS because, in a very real sense, it competes for students with many types of private and parochial schools\nthroughout Jefferson County. In recent years, it has competed very successfully. One of the ways JCPS meets\n[40]\nthe competition is by offering quality education in an integrated setting at every school.  Every measure of\nstudent and public attitudes on the value of integration completely supports the conclusion that an integrated\n[41]\nschool system is an advantage for many parents and students.\nThe evidence on each of these points demonstrates that maintaining an integrated system may help the Board to\nachieve its goals for individual students and the system as a whole. The Court concludes, therefore, that the\nBoard's policy of integrated schools is both important and valid.\n\nC.\nThe final factor of the compelling interest analysis is whether the Board's motives are sincere and not aimed at\nsome improper or illegitimate purpose, or are merely for the purpose of racial balancing.\nIn Hampton II, this Court considered this very question at some length because the Board's commitment to the\nideal of an integrated system went to the very essence of whether dissolving the existing desegregation decree\n855 was proper. The *855 Court found that the Board had been truly dedicated to quality education, racial equity and\nintegration over the past twenty-five years. The Board's commitment to the idea of an integrated school system\nwas so strong that it continued even after it was unclear whether Supreme Court precedent or the decree\nrequired it. The Board took affirmative steps to build strong public support for its policies of an integrated school\nsystem, even when it clashed with the changing educational, social, political and legal perspectives of the 80's\nand 90's. Hampton II, 102 F.Supp.2d at 369-70.\nSuccessive boards and administrations dedicated themselves to integration in a manner thought to be\nconstitutionally acceptable. Id. at 370. In the process, the Board treated the idea of an integrated system as much\nmore than a legal obligation. The Board considered it \"a positive, desirable policy and an essential element of any\nwell-rounded public school education.\" Id. No one says that the Board somehow intends to discriminate or\nmarginalize either Black or White students. In fact, the Board needs the support of each group to maintain\nroughly equal schools and a community school system that is attractive to all.\nThese findings demonstrate conclusively that JCPS is not advancing an interest in racial balancing that the\nSupreme Court would label as \"patently unconstitutional.\" Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330, 123 S.Ct. 2325. \"Racial\nbalance is not to be achieved for its own sake.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494, 112 S.Ct. 1430. And, to use race for\nthis purpose fails for want of a compelling reason. In his Grutter dissent, Chief Justice Rehnquist said that, absent\nan adequate explanation of the law school's interest, its attempts to reach a \"critical mass\" were nothing more\nthan unconstitutional racial balancing. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 378-87, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\nJustice O'Connor distinguished Michigan Law School's use of race as \"defined by reference to the educational\nbenefits that [its compelling reason] is designed to produce.\" Id. at 330, 123 S.Ct. 2325. In our case, the same\ndistinction applies, but with even greater force. The Board has precisely described the academic, social and\ninstitutional benefits it achieves from integrated schools. This is a compelling explanation and one that is\nsupported by overwhelming evidence. Based on the evidence, no one can honestly say that JCPS is asserting an\ninterest in racial balancing merely for its own sake.\nConsidering all the evidence presented in this and other cases, the Court is convinced that the Board's policy of\n[42]\nmaintaining an integrated school system is sincerely held and not intended to disadvantage any race.  Based\non the strong evidence of the Board's sincerity and the importance and validity of its goals, the Court concludes\nthat the Board has met its burden of establishing a compelling interest in maintaining racially integrated schools.\nVI.\nTHE 2001 PLAN IS NARROWLY TAILORED IN MOST RESPECTS\nEven to achieve a compelling purpose, the Board may use race only by means that are \"specifically and narrowly\nframed to accomplish that purpose.\" Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S.\n899, 908, 116 S.Ct. 1894, 135 L.Ed.2d 207 (1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted). To be narrowly tailored,\n856 the Board's use of race must \"`fit' this compelling goal so closely *856 that there is little or no possibility that the\nmotive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.\" J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 493, 109\nS.Ct. 706. The Court's narrow tailoring inquiry must be carefully \"calibrated to fit the distinct issues raised by the\nuse of race\" in this case. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Consequently, the Court will evaluate whether\nthe 2001 Plan is narrowly tailored, or is a proper \"fit,\" in light of the factual and analytical differences between this\ncase and the admissions programs reviewed in Grutter and Gratz.\n\nThe complexity of these legal issues and the absence of judicial unanimity mean that fundamental truths about\nnarrow tailoring are difficult to discern. The Grutter and Gratz opinions reveal a starkly divided court that\ndetermines equal protection jurisprudence by a shifting coalition of views in a given context or case. The Court\nmust proceed carefully. For that reason, the Court will not accord even limited deference to the Board's\n[43]\nimplementation of its goals.\nWith these principles in mind, in order to determine whether the 2001 Plan is narrowly tailored, the Court will\nevaluate the four primary factors that the Supreme Court considered in Grutter: (1) whether the 2001 Plan\namounts to a quota that seeks a fixed number of desirable minority students and insulates one group of\napplicants from another, id. at 334-35, 123 S.Ct. 2325; (2) whether the applicant is afforded individualized review,\nid. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 2325; (3) whether the 2001 Plan \"unduly harm[s] members of any racial group,\" id. at 341,\n123 S.Ct. 2325; and (4) whether JCPS has given \"serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\n[44]\nalternatives\" to achieve its goals, id. at 339, 123 S.Ct. 2325.  Together, these factors constitute the \"fit\" that is\nso important to the narrow tailoring analysis. Id. at 333, 123 S.Ct. 2325. The Court's analysis will focus upon\nelements of the 2001 Plan that govern assignment to non-traditional schools. In a separate section, the Court will\nconsider whether the student assignment process for traditional schools is narrowly tailored.\nThe Court now considers each of these factors in turn.\nA.\nThe most important narrow tailoring issue, and Plaintiffs' primary argument, concerns whether the 2001 Plan\noperates as a racial quota. \"Properly understood, a `quota' is a program in which a certain fixed number or\nproportion of opportunities are `reserved exclusively for certain minority groups.' \"Id. at 335, 123 S.Ct. 2325\n(quoting J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 496, 109 S.Ct. 706). The Supreme Court said that a race-conscious\nadmissions program cannot use a quota system because it would almost always violate the narrow tailoring\nrequirement. Id. at 334-35, 123 S.Ct. 2325. As the Supreme Court also wisely noted, however, \"`[s]ome attention\n857 to numbers,' without more, does not transform *857 a flexible admissions system into a rigid quota.\" Id. at 336,\n123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 323, 98 S.Ct. 2733). Common sense and the Supreme Court suggest\nthat any strict or de facto racial quota has a couple of known characteristics: it has a precise target, and it\ninsulates some applicants from competition with other applicants. The Court concludes that, for the most part, the\n2001 Plan's use of the racial guidelines lacks these attributes.\n1.\n[45]\nBy definition, a quota must present a relatively precise target.  While this would appear clear enough,\neveryone appears to have different ways of applying this definition to a given set of facts.\nThe 2001 Plan's racial guidelines for all schools present a quite flexible and broad target range. The Board's goal\nis to achieve a racial mix of between 15% and 50% Black students at each school. That the actual percentage of\nBlack students at individual schools ranges between 20.1% and 50.4% demonstrates the extent of the Board's\nflexibility in achieving its goals. Even within this broad range, the Court finds a wide dispersal among the\npercentages of Black students in JCPS schools. For instance, 62 out of 87 elementary schools, 17 of 23 middle\nschools, and 15 of 20 high schools have a racial mix of over 40% or under 30% Black students. In other words,\nonly about 30% of all schools show a racial mix within even five percent of either side of the systemwide average.\nThis represents a widely dispersed range in Black students among JCPS schools rather than a precise target.\nEveryone seems to have an opinion about the meaning of statistics. In Grutter, for instance, Justices O'Connor\nand Kennedy battled over statistics and what constituted a quota. Justice O'Connor called the Michigan Law\nSchool's percentages of minority students, which varied between 13.5% and 20.1%, \"a range inconsistent with a\nquota.\" Grutter, 539 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Justice Kennedy, however, concluded that the percentage of\nminority law students fell in a much tighter range that he called a quota. He viewed race as almost \"an automatic\nfactor\" that made the law school's \"numerical goals indistinguishable from quotas.\" Id. at 389, 123 S.Ct. 2325\n\n(Kennedy, J., dissenting). He said that \"[t]he narrow fluctuation band [among rates of admission for Black\napplicants] raises an inference that the Law School subverted individual determination, and strict scrutiny\nrequires the Law School to overcome the inference.\" Id. at 390-91, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Justice Kennedy cited\nAmherst College, which admitted between about 8.5% (81 out of 950 offers) and 13.2% (125 out of 950 offers)\nminority applicants over a ten-year period, as an example of a range not suggestive of a quota. Id. In our case,\none finds neither an automatic assignment nor a \"narrow band\" of percentages of Black students among JCPS\nschools. Indeed, the range in the percentage of Black students among all JCPS schools is much broader than the\n858 range in minority admissions at either Amherst College or Michigan Law School.[46]*858 This wide fluctuation\nsuggests a lesser use of race and the absence of a specific target. Finally, even a cursory review of assignment\ndata reveals that neither Black students nor White students are guaranteed assignment to a particular school.\nToo many race-neutral factors affect assignment for that to be true.\n2.\nA quota also insulates \"each category of applicants with certain desired qualifications from competition with all\nother applicants.\" Id. at 334, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 315, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (Powell, J.)). In other\nwords, it \"put[s] members of those groups on separate admissions tracks.\" Id. (citing Bakke, 438 U.S. at 315-16,\n98 S.Ct. 2733 (Powell, J.)). Except for traditional school assignment, all JCPS students are subject to the same\ncriteria within the 2001 Plan. Criteria such as residence, student choice and random lottery are significant\nassignment factors for every student. No JCPS student is insulated from competition with all other students, and\nno student is placed on a separate admissions track.\nIt is constitutionally permissible to set racial goals to achieve truly compelling interests. It is impermissible,\nhowever, to seek that racial goal so assiduously and precisely that it amounts to a quota. JCPS's conduct\nresembles the former because it has set \"a permissible goal ... requir [ing] only a good-faith effort ... to come\nwithin a range demarcated by the goal itself.\" Id. at 335, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n\nv. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 495, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986)). The broad range in the guidelines shows\nthat the Board does not operate a de facto quota that imposes or arrives at a \"fixed number or percentage which\nmust be attained.\" Id. (quoting Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n, 478 U.S. at 495, 106 S.Ct. 3019). Thus, the\nevidence simply does not support the conclusion that the broad racial guidelines actually mask a tighter range,\ncreate a de facto quota or insulate one group of applicants from competition with another group.\nB.\nIn Grutter, Justice O'Connor noted that the law school's \"highly individualized\" review of applications meant that\nthe admissions process did not contain \"mechanical\" or \"predetermined diversity bonuses.\" Id. at 337, 123 S.Ct.\n2325. For her, the law school's approach was more nuanced than that of the undergraduate admissions program\nbecause the law school conducted a meaningful review of the individual candidate's application. In fact, in her \nGratz concurrence joined by Justice Breyer, she noted the absence of individualized attention when finding the\nundergraduate program's use of race in its admissions policy impermissible. Gratz, 539 U.S. at 276-77, 123 S.Ct.\n2411 (O'Connor, J., concurring). The switch that Justices O'Connor and Breyer made between Grutter and Gratz\nreveals a potential fault line in the narrow tailoring analysis: the presence or absence of individualized review.\nConsequently, the Court must determine whether the 2001 Plan incorporates some sufficient form of\nindividualized attention in the assignment process. The Court concludes that it does.\n\"[H]ighly individualized, holistic review\" of each applicant ensures that \"each applicant is evaluated as an\n859 individual and not in a way that makes an applicant's race or *859 ethnicity the defining feature of his or her\napplication.\" Grutter, 539 U.S. at 337, 123 S.Ct. 2325. All relevant factors for assignment must be placed \"on the\nsame footing for consideration\" even though one factor may be accorded more weight in the end. Id. (quoting \nBakke, 438 U.S. at 317, 98 S.Ct. 2733) (internal quotation marks omitted). Likewise, the process must ensure\nthat \"all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in\nadmissions decisions.\" Id. Under those circumstances, race is \"one of many factors\" to consider and may be\n\nused as a permissible \"tipping\" factor in deciding a particular student's placement. Id. at 339, 123 S.Ct. 2325\n(citing Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316, 98 S.Ct. 2733).\nOne must analyze the 2001 Plan in its totally different context. Unlike the law school, JCPS does not deny\nanyone the benefits of an education. Unlike the law school, JCPS does not have the goal of creating elite and\nhighly selective school communities. Unlike the law school's admissions process, the JCPS assignment process\ndoes not involve weighing comparative criteria in a competitive manner. Rather than excluding applicants, the\nBoard's goal is to create more equal school communities for educating all students. But, like the law school, the\nJCPS assignment process focuses a great deal of attention upon the individual characteristics of a student's\napplication, such as place of residence and student choice of school or program. It is individualized attention of a\ndifferent kind in a different context than the Supreme Court found in Grutter.\nIn significant ways, the 2001 Plan actually operates like the \"plus\" system of which the Supreme Court has\nspoken so approvingly. Id. at 335, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (citing Johnson v. Transp. Agency, 480 U.S. 616, 638, 107\nS.Ct. 1442, 94 L.Ed.2d 615 (1987)). Many factors determine student assignment, including address, student\nchoice, lottery placement, and, at the margins, the racial guidelines. But, race is simply one possible factor\namong many, acting only occasionally as a permissible \"tipping\" factor in most of the JCPS assignment process.\nThe Supreme Court has said this narrow use of race is permissible given a compelling reason. Specifically,\nJustice Powell stated in Bakke that \"[w]hen the [Harvard] Committee on Admissions reviews the large middle\ngroup of applicants who are `admissible' and deemed capable of doing good work in their courses, the race of an\napplicant may tip the balance in his favor....\" 438 U.S. 265, 316, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (quoting\nfrom amicus brief regarding aspects of Harvard admissions policy). In Grutter, the Supreme Court echoed these\nsentiments, stating that situations where race makes a difference in admissions could happen in \"any plan that\nuses race as one of many factors,\" including the Michigan Law School plan. 539 U.S. at 339, 123 S.Ct. 2325.\nIn light of the foregoing analysis, the Court concludes that the 2001 Plan allows for the consideration of several\nfactors, including race. Moreover, except as to traditional schools, the appropriate consideration of individual\nfactors within the assignment context ensures that race does not become \"the defining feature\" of a student's\napplication.\nC.\nAnother factor in the narrow tailoring analysis is that the Board's use of race does not \"unduly harm members of\nany racial group.\" Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341, 123 S.Ct. 2325. This is neither a new nor surprising concept. Some\ntwenty-six years ago, Justice Powell referenced the same distinction between denial of admission to a selective\n860 graduate school and the assignment of a student to an alternative *860 but appropriate public school. Bakke, 438\n[47]\nU.S. at 300 n. 39, 98 S.Ct. 2733.  His observation seems applicable here.\nJustice Powell's observation is consistent with the now well established concept that a student has no\nconstitutional right to attend a particular school. Johnson v. Bd. of Educ. of Chi., 604 F.2d 504, 515 (7th Cir.1979);\nHall v. St. Helena Parish Sch. Bd., 417 F.2d 801, 810 n. 15 (5th Cir.1969); see Milliken, 418 U.S. at 746-47, 94\nS.Ct. 3112; United States v. S. Bend Cmty. Sch. Corp., 692 F.2d 623, 627 (7th Cir.1982) (citing United States v.\nPerry County Bd. of Educ., 567 F.2d 277, 279 (5th Cir.1978)). As this Court explained in Hampton II, the\nconsequences of assigning students to various public schools are quite different from denying an applicant\nadmission to a selective college or job placement:\nThe workplace, marketplace, and higher education cases are poor models for most elementary\nand secondary public school education precisely because they always involve vertical choices 00\n97\none person is hired, promoted, receives a valuable contract, or gains admission. Ordinarily, when\nJCPS assigns students to a particular elementary, middle, or high school, the assignment has no\nqualitative or `vertical' effects. This is so because the Court concludes that as between two regular\nelementary schools, assignment to one or another imposes no burden and confers no benefit. The\nsame education is offered at each school, so assignment to one or another is basically fungible.\nAs a logical consequence, most courts have concluded that there is no individual right to attend a\n\nspecific school in a district or to attend a neighborhood school. As among basically equal schools,\nthe use of race would not be a `preference.' As among basically equal schools, therefore, JCPS's\npolicy is not one of `affirmative action.'\n102 F.Supp.2d at 380 (citations and footnotes omitted). The difference between the use of race in graduate\nschool admissions and the JCPS student assignment plan results from the vastly different concept of each\nsystem. The law school admissions program excludes many applicants because of its goal of creating an elite\ncommunity. The JCPS policy of creating communities of equal and integrated schools for everyone excludes no\none from those communities. Consequently, when the Board makes a student assignment among its equal and\n[48]\nintegrated schools, it neither denies anyone a benefit nor imposes a wrongful burden.\n861 *861 The Court concludes that the 2001 Plan uses race in a manner calculated not to harm any particular person\nbecause of his or her race. Certainly, no student is directly denied a benefit because of race so that another of a\ndifferent race can receive that benefit. Rather, the Board uses race in a limited way to achieve benefits for all\nstudents through its integrated schools.\nD.\nFinally, narrow tailoring requires \"serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives that will\nachieve\" the Board's goals. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339, 123 S.Ct. 2325. It is apparent that, with the notable\nexception of the traditional schools, the Board not only considered, but actually implemented, a variety of race-\nneutral strategies to achieve its goals.\nMany aspects of the 2001 Plan have avoided using race at all. About 18,000 students, almost 20% of the system,\nare not covered by the racial guidelines because they attend special schools, programs or kindergarten.\nVoluntary student choices for numerous academic concentrations and school settings create a certain degree of\nintegration within different schools and the system as a whole. School geographic boundaries accomplish much\nthe same. These two factors account for a vast proportion of all student assignments.\n\"Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative.\" Id. For instance, the\nBoard could accomplish its objective through some form of an assignment lottery covering the entire school\nsystem. Such a system, however, would require a \"dramatic sacrifice\" in student choice, geographic convenience\nand program specialization. Id. at 340, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Moreover, it could only be achieved at a huge financial\ncost. This is not required.\nIn every area of school assignment except the traditional schools, the Board has undertaken considerable effort\nto achieve its goals without the overt use of race in student assignments. It encourages students of all races to\nexercise choices. It recruits Black and White students for academic programs that promote educational\nimprovement and enhance school integration. As a consequence, the Board's goal of an integrated school\nsystem is achieved primarily through alternative measures that are educationally laudable and restrained in the\nuse of race. The Court concludes that, throughout most of the assignment process, the Board sufficiently\nconsidered and used alternatives, which either were race-neutral or made minimal use of race, to meet narrow\ntailoring requirements.\nE.\nIn summary, except for the traditional school assignment process, which will be discussed separately, the 2001\nPlan is a proper \"fit\" because it is sufficiently flexible to determine school assignments for all students by a host of\nfactors, such as residence, student choice, capacity, school and program popularity, pure chance and race. Id. at\n862 337, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Data showing that the majority of students attend their resides schools and that only a *862\nvery small percentage of students are not assigned to one of the schools they preferred suggest the minimal\nimpact of race on this process. Even for those students assigned to a school they did not select, race is not\nnecessarily \"a defining feature\" in those assignments. Students may also be enrolled in a particular school\nbecause, for instance, (a) they did not make any choices at all or stated only a preference for one particular\n\nmagnet program that did not accept them, or (b) their preferred or resides school or program was already filled to\ncapacity. Even where race does \"tip\" the balance in some cases, it does so only at the end of the process, after\nresidence, choice and all the other factors have played their part.\nThe 2001 Plan also \"fits\" its intended objectives because it does not unduly harm other students. The Plan works\nso that most students attend a school of their choice. Because all schools have similar funding, offer similar\nacademic programs and comprise more similar ranges of students than possible in neighborhood schools, an\nassignment to one school over another does not cause constitutional harm to any student.\nExcept as to traditional schools, the Court cannot see that JCPS has any other workable race-neutral alternatives\nfor accomplishing its compelling objective.\nVII.\nTHE TRADITIONAL SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT PROCESS IS NOT\nNARROWLY TAILORED\nThe sole exception to the Court's narrow tailoring inquiry concerns the traditional school assignment process.\n[49]\nTraditional school enrollment amounts to a small portion of the overall student census.  The assignment\nprocess for those schools has features that make it distinct from other aspects of the 2001 Plan and present\nparticularly difficult constitutional questions. In the end, the Court finds that the use of race in the traditional\nschool assignment process is not narrowly tailored.\nIn some respects, the traditional schools are no different than others throughout JCPS. Traditional schools have\nthe same curriculum, financial resources and student discipline regulations as nearly every other school. They\noffer a distinct atmosphere for the same educational curriculum available at most other schools. The broad racial\nguidelines cover traditional schools in the same manner as every other school. Were the traditional school\nassignment process to function under the same broad racial guidelines and operational principles as previously\ndiscussed, it would be entirely permissible.\nThe traditional school assignment process, however, differs in two respects that have constitutional significance:\n(1) the assignment process puts Black and White applicants on separate assignment tracks, and (2) its use of the\nseparate lists appears to be completely unnecessary to accomplish the Board's goal.\nThe significance of separating traditional school applicants into explicit racial categories is that students are\nplaced on separate assignment tracks where race becomes \"the defining feature of his or her application.\" \nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 334, 337, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Elsewhere in the 2001 Plan, the racial guidelines play a muted role\nin the assignment process along with other factors, such as residence, program capacity and, sometimes,\n863 placement in a lottery. True, an individual student's selection to a *863 traditional school depends in some\nmeasure upon the luck of the random draw. It is, however, a random draw within each separate racial category.\nThe assignment process insulates one group of applicants from the randomness of choice and \"competition\" with\nother applicants. The use of categories, therefore, makes race the \"defining feature\" rather than merely the\n[50]\n\"tipping\" factor.  In this Court's view, the Supreme Court would likely find these racial categories highly\nsuspect.\nAn even more troublesome aspect of these racial classifications is that they appear entirely unnecessary to\nachieve the Board's stated goal of racial integration. The Court has compared data regarding the racial make-up\nof the applicant pools in the last two academic years with the racial make-up of the student populations in\nindividual traditional schools at the same time. Overall, the percentage of Black applicants each year to a\nparticular traditional school rather closely approximated the percentage of Black students in that school's\n[51]\npopulation.  Under the general law of probabilities, if applicants were selected off of one random draw list, the\nratio of Black to White students in the applicant pool at a particular school would be reflected in the ratio of Black\nto White students in the pool of admitted students and, consequently, in the school's student population at large.\n\nMore importantly, given the current numbers of Black students applying to traditional schools, the laws of\n864 probability predict that each school would fall within the racial guidelines. This is true even at *864 Greathouse\nElementary and Johnson Middle where numbers of Black applicants hover at either end of the guidelines. This\nevidence suggests that the use of racial categories is completely unnecessary.\nJCPS says that separate racial lists are necessary to maintain solid levels of Black student participation in\ntraditional schools. JCPS fears that, without the lists, Black students would be admitted in fewer numbers, racial\nisolation would result, and Black students would be discouraged from applying in the future. Even if this\nspeculation should prove true, the Board has much less intrusive and more precisely targeted means at its\ndisposal to maintain present levels of Black student participation in the traditional program or to rectify decreased\nfuture participation at certain schools. JCPS can enhance its recruitment efforts for White and Black students at\nvarious traditional schools. It can redraw traditional school boundaries (at least at the elementary and middle\nschool levels) to increase the chances of attracting more Black students from neighborhoods in which Blacks\nreside and increase outreach to Black families. As the 2001 Plan provides, the Board could then use race as a\n\"tipping\" factor if necessary to achieve its compelling goals.\nThe Court must conclude that the initial separation of traditional school applicants into racial categories makes\nrace a defining feature of the student's application and is entirely unnecessary to accomplish the Board's stated\nobjective of racial integration. This use of race in the 2001 Plan therefore is not narrowly tailored. By revising the\n2001 Plan in a manner consistent with this Memorandum Opinion, the Board may maintain its current assignment\nprocess. Although the Court has found that the use of racial categories under the 2001 Plan violates Plaintiffs'\nrights under the Equal Protection Clause, their children are not entitled to admission to the school of their choice.\nFirst, Plaintiff McFarland's children, Stephen and Daniel, are already enrolled in a traditional school, mooting their\nparticular request for injunctive relief. Second, Plaintiffs Pittenger and Underwood have offered no proof that their\nchildren, Brandon Pittenger and Kenneth Aubrey, respectively, were denied entry into a traditional school solely\nbecause of their race. Finally, neither has reapplied for the traditional program in a subsequent year. While the\nCourt will enjoin the use of the racial categories in the traditional school assignment process, equity does not\nrequire that Plaintiffs' children be admitted to the school of their choice in the upcoming school year. Like all\nJCPS students, Plaintiffs Pittenger and Underwood may reapply for admission to a traditional school for the\n2005-2006 academic year.\nThe Court will enter an order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\nORDER\nThe Court has issued a Memorandum Opinion setting forth its views on the issues raised in this case. Being\notherwise sufficiently advised,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs' request for relief is granted only to the extent that JCPS shall revise the\nstudent assignment process for traditional magnet schools in a manner consistent with the accompanying\nMemorandum Opinion in time for its use in the 2005-2006 school year assignments.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, as to all other aspects of the JCPS student assignment plan, Plaintiffs' requests\nfor relief are DENIED.\nThis is a final and appealable order.\n[1] Plaintiffs offer a litany of federal laws under which federal jurisdiction is appropriate and under which they\nrequest that the Court find their civil rights have been violated: Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\nU.S.C. § 703(a)(1), the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §\n1681, KRS ch. 344, the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and \"appropriate paragraphs\"\nof the Kentucky State Constitution. The arguments presented by both sides have addressed only the\nconstitutionality of the racial guidelines under the Equal Protection Clause.\n[2] 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954).\n\n[3] Plaintiff David McFarland has two boys, Stephen and Daniel. In 2002-2003, Stephen applied to Jefferson\nCounty Traditional Middle School (\"JCTMS\") as a rising sixth grader without indicating a second choice option for\na magnet or optional program. He was rejected by JCTMS and assigned to Newburg, his resides middle school.\nHe then applied for a transfer to Myers Middle School, where he was accepted and enrolled. In 2003-2004,\nStephen reapplied to JCTMS and was accepted. He attended JCTMS for the seventh grade. \nDaniel McFarland lives in the Price Cluster. His resides elementary school is Bates. In 2002-2003, Daniel applied\nto two cluster schools, Fern Creek and Luhr, as well as to Schaffner Traditional Elementary without indicating a\nsecond choice option for a different magnet or optional program. He was rejected by Schaffner and chose not to\naccept an offer to go to the traditional program at Maupin; enrollment in the Maupin program would have put\nDaniel in the traditional school \"pipeline.\" Daniel was then assigned to Fern Creek. He did not apply for a transfer\nfrom Fern Creek after the cluster and magnet application process was complete. In 2003-2004, Daniel applied\nagain to Schaffner Traditional without indicating a second choice magnet program and was accepted. He\nattended Schaffner for the second grade.\nPlaintiff Ronald Pittenger's son, Brandon, attended Bates Elementary School for kindergarten through fifth grade.\nIn 2002-2003, as a rising sixth grader, Brandon applied to JCTMS as his first choice and the Newburg Math,\nScience and Technology Magnet Program as his second choice. He was not accepted at JCTMS, and his\napplication to the Newburg MST Program was not processed because a student can only enroll in the Newburg\nmagnet program if it is listed as the student's first choice. Brandon chose not to attend his resides middle school\nat Newburg. Brandon later enrolled at Evangel Christian School for the sixth grade and chose to stay there. He\ndid not reapply to JCTMS or any other public school option in 2003-2004.\nPlaintiff Anthony Underwood's son, Kenneth Maxwell Aubrey, attended several different schools in Jefferson\nCounty and elsewhere from kindergarten through fifth grade. In 2002-2003, he applied as a rising sixth grader to\nJCTMS without offering a second choice magnet or optional program. His application was rejected by JCTMS,\nand he was assigned to Newburg. He applied for a transfer to Myers Middle School, which was accepted, and he\nenrolled in Myers for the sixth grade. In 2003-2004, he did not apply for magnet programs nor a transfer from\nMyers. He attended Myers in the seventh grade.\nPlaintiff Crystal Meredith's son, Joshua McDonald, was unable to be enrolled in his resides school, Breckinridge-\nFranklin Elementary School, because it was filled to capacity. He was then assigned to Young Elementary School\n(\"Young\") for kindergarten in 2002-2003. He applied for a transfer to Bloom Elementary School (\"Bloom\"), which\nwas not in his assigned cluster of schools, and was denied admittance because his transfer to Bloom would have\nhad an adverse effect on Young's racial composition in violation of the racial guidelines under the student\nassignment plan. Joshua, however, did not apply for any further transfers after his request for Bloom was denied\n(students are unlimited in the number of transfer requests they can make), did not appeal the decision to deny\nthe transfer, and did not apply in 2003-2004 for a different cluster school, a magnet program, or another transfer.\nJoshua attended Young in the first grade.\n[4] Plaintiffs called four witnesses. Plaintiffs David McFarland, Ronald Pittenger, and Crystal Meredith testified\nabout their experiences with the traditional school admissions process and the student assignment plan in\ngeneral. Plaintiffs also called an additional witness, Cherri Jackson, who testified about her failed attempt to\nenroll her children at the elementary school that she preferred in her cluster.\n[5] Defendants called thirteen witnesses (listed in order of appearance): Carol Ann Haddad, a school board\nmember, testified about changes in 1991 and 1996 to the student assignment plan, the origins of the traditional\nprogram, and more generally about the importance and benefits of racial integration in education; Dr. Stephen\nDaeschner, JCPS Superintendent, testified about the student assignment plan and the traditional program, the\nvariables involved in reducing the achievement gap between Blacks and Whites and low and high performing\nschools, and the benefits of racial integration; Patricia Todd, Executive Director for Student Assignment, testified\nabout the different types of schools and academic programs and the assignment process for the traditional\nschools and JCPS as a whole; Carolyn Meredith, Director of Employee Relations for JCPS, testified about the\nhiring and placement of principals and teachers; Loudena Peabody, Director of Instructional Support for JCPS,\ntestified about her previous experience as a teacher and principal in JCPS and methods for improving student\n\nperformance; Sam Corbett, former school board member and local business owner, testified about the\nimportance of racial integration in education as it prepares students for working in a diverse workplace and the\nlack of differences between traditional and non-traditional schools; Dr. Robert Rodosky, Executive Director of\nAccountability, Research, and Planning, testified about the demographic make-up of and racial segregation in\nhousing in Jefferson County, data about the student assignment process, data about state testing scores, use of\nincome data as a predictor of academic performance, and data about the traditional school admissions process;\nDr. Edward Kifer, Jr., Professor in the College of Education at the University of Kentucky, testified about research\nregarding socioeconomic status as a predictor of academic success, the achievement gap between Blacks and\nWhites, and the impact of diversity on a public school system; Janice Hardin, Chief Financial Officer and\nTreasurer for JCPS, testified about school funding, per pupil expenditures, and teacher salaries; Tito Castillo,\nPrincipal of Fern Creek Traditional High School, testified about the similarities of his traditional high school to the\nmagnet traditional program; Mark Rose, Principal at Jefferson County Traditional Middle School (\"JCTMS\"),\ntestified about the differences and similarities between traditional and non-traditional public schools and the\nadmissions process at JCTMS; Rick Caple, Director of Transportation for JCPS, testified about the JCPS\ntransportation system for students and the transportation budget; Joseph Burks, Assistant Superintendent for\nJCPS High Schools, testified about his previous experience as principal of Louisville Male and his knowledge of\nMale and Butler as compared with other traditional JCPS high schools; and Dr. Gary Orfield, Professor of\nEducation and Social Policy at Harvard University and Co-Director of the Harvard Civil Rights Project, testified\nabout his research on desegregation and the benefits of diversity in public schools.\n[6] The JCPS student assignment plan records the race of each student as Black or African-American and Other,\nwhich this Court will denote as \"White.\" This particular practice of distinguishing only Black and non-Black\nstudents and referencing non-Black students as \"Others\" was discussed rather extensively during the hearing. As\nseveral witnesses testified, JCPS is a school district almost entirely populated by only Black and White students.\nStudents of other races and backgrounds, such as Latino and Asian students, are represented only in very small\nnumbers, e.g., less than five percent of the total student population is neither non-Hispanic Black nor White. The\nCourt believes that it is more accurate to refer to the two groups as \"Black\" and \"White.\"\n[7] The Comprehensive Program is the main instructional program. The Advance Program offers a curriculum for\ngifted and talented students. The Honors Program provides intensive academic preparation for middle and high\nschool students in the Comprehensive Program. The Exceptional Child Education Program offers services to\nstudents with identified disabilities.\n[8]See Newburg Area Council, Inc. v. Bd. of Educ. of Jefferson County, 489 F.2d 925 (6th Cir.1973); Newburg\nArea Council, Inc. v. Bd. of Educ. of Jefferson County, 510 F.2d 1358 (6th Cir.1974); Newburg Area Council, Inc.\nv. Gordon, 521 F.2d 578 (6th Cir.1975); Cunningham v. Grayson, 541 F.2d 538 (6th Cir.1976); Haycraft v. Bd. of\nEduc. of Jefferson County, 560 F.2d 755 (6th Cir.1977); Haycraft v. Bd. of Educ. of Jefferson County, 585 F.2d\n803 (6th Cir.1978); Hampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 72 F.Supp.2d 753 (W.D.Ky.1999) (\"Hampton I\"); \nHampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 102 F.Supp.2d 358 (W.D.Ky.2000) (\"Hampton II\").\n[9] Some of the Court's findings in Hampton II are relevant to the current case: (1) the Board demonstrated\nextraordinary good faith through its dedication to quality education in an integrated setting, 102 F.Supp.2d at\n369-70; and (2) the Board's student assignment plan was no longer bound by a federal court decree, id. at 377.\nThe Court concluded the following: (1) that elected school boards had traditional authority to establish an\neducational policy, id. at 379; (2) that, as between equal schools, the assignment to one particular school did not\ncreate a burden or confer a benefit that was constitutionally protected, id. at 380; (3) that the Board could use\nrace along with other factors to maintain an integrated school system, id. at 379; and (4) that the use of racial\nquotas to exclude students from magnet schools with special programs violated the Equal Protection Clause, id.\nat 381. The Court did not discuss the status of traditional schools or the assignment process for them.\n[10] At the elementary school level, 57% of students attended their resides school. At the middle school level,\n67.5% attended their resides school. At the high school level, 49.7% attended their resides school.\n[11] Magnet programs are located at the following schools: at the elementary school level, Byck, Coleridge-Taylor\nMontessori, Foster, Kennedy Montessori, King, Maupin, Wheatley, and Young; at the middle school level,\n\nFarnsley, Highland, Thomas Jefferson, Meyzeek, Newburg, and Noe; and at the high school level, Atherton,\nDoss, Seneca, and Western. Foster and Maupin elementary schools have traditional magnet programs.\n[12] Optional programs are located at the following schools: at the elementary school level, Cane Run and Price;\nat the middle school level, Crosby, Highland, Lassiter, Moore, Southern Leadership Academy, Stuart, and\nWestport Traditional; and at the high school level, Doss, Eastern, Fern Creek, Iroquois, Jeffersontown, Moore,\nPleasure Ridge Park, Seneca, Shawnee, Southern, Valley, Waggener, and Western.\n[13] Students who apply to the Math, Science and Technology Program at Farnsley, Meyzeek, or Newburg middle\nschools and are accepted to the program are assigned to one of those schools based upon place of residence.\n[14] Magnet career academies are located at Atherton, Central, Doss, Fairdale, Fern Creek, Iroquois,\nJeffersontown, Moore, Pleasure Ridge Park, Seneca, Shawnee, Southern, Valley, and Waggener.\n[15] A school may approve transfer applications for a variety of reasons, including day care arrangements,\nmedical criteria, family hardship, student adjustment problems, and program offerings. In addition, school\ncapacity, a student's attendance record, behavior, grades and the racial guidelines play a role. Three of Plaintiffs'\nchildren applied to transfer out of the schools to which they were assigned. Two were successful; one was not.\nAfter Stephen McFarland and Kenneth Aubrey were not accepted to Jefferson County Traditional, they both\napplied for a transfer to Myers Middle School from their resides school at Newburg, and both were accepted.\nJoshua McDonald also applied for a transfer to Bloom Elementary School when he could not enroll in his resides\nschool at Breckinridge-Franklin and was assigned to Young. His transfer request was denied under the racial\nguidelines, but he did not apply for another transfer that year nor did he submit an application for his resides\nschool, another cluster school, a magnet school or program, or a transfer to another school the following year.\n[16] Overall, over the past two years, transfer and open enrollment applications together have represented about\n7.6% of JCPS students. However, many students apply for both. Therefore, the actual number of students\nseeking either is probably less than 5%. In 2003-2004, JCPS received 1,208 open enrollment applications and\naccepted 335, or 27.7%. In 2002-2003, JCPS received a total of 6,185 transfer applications and granted 4,061, or\n65.7%.\n[17] A student could apply for and receive acceptance to a magnet or traditional school, a magnet or optional\nprogram, or a cluster or other school by transfer.\n[18] Generally, about 95-96% of all elementary students receive their first or second choice cluster school. In\n2003-2004, about 30% of elementary school applicants to magnet or optional programs received their first or\nsecond choice.\n[19] The admissions process for the traditional schools will be explained separately.\n[20] The traditional schools are as follows: at the elementary school level, Audubon, Carter, Greathouse/Shryock,\nand Schaffner; at the middle school level, Barret, Jefferson County Traditional, and Johnson; and at the high\nschool level, Butler and Louisville Male.\n[21] Foster is a traditional program within a resides school. In 2003-2004, about half of its students were in the\ntraditional program. Maupin also has a separate traditional program within its resides school, but all students at\nMaupin receive traditional instruction. Most importantly, as described later, any student attending the traditional\nprogram at these schools is part of the traditional school \"pipeline.\"\n[22] These resides schools have elected to provide instruction to their students in a traditional or structured\nenvironment, with the same emphasis on traditional discipline and other instructional concepts as the traditional\nmagnet schools. All eight schools have \"turned\" traditional in the past ten years: Smyrna and Wilkerson\nelementary schools, Moore and Westport middle schools, and Fern Creek, Moore, Valley, and Waggener high\nschools. Each school's SBDM council, with Board approval, made the decision and designed the instructional\nprogram and environment at these schools. Students attending these eight resides traditional schools do not\nbecome part of the traditional school \"pipeline\" discussed in Section III.E.1.\n[23] A small number of kindergarten students attend the traditional programs at Foster and Maupin.\n\n[24] For instance, Schaffner has 72 slots available at kindergarten, so a principal will be able to take more\nstudents at that time. But, as the grades progress, a principal will have fewer and fewer slots available for new\napplicants because spaces are filled by students already in the \"pipeline.\"\n[25] In Jefferson County, fewer Black than White students tend to apply to traditional schools so that the lists of\nBlack males and females will be shorter than the lists for White applicants. Black applicants, therefore, generally\nhave a higher chance of acceptance to traditional schools than White applicants because their numbers are\nsmaller.\n[26] No Justice appears to have suggested that a lesser degree of scrutiny was appropriate in either Grutter or \nGratz.\n[27]See Raso v. Lago, 135 F.3d 11, 16-17 (1st Cir.1998); Jacobson v. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ., 961 F.2d 100,\n102-03 (6th Cir.1992); Kromnick v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 739 F.2d 894, 902-03 (3d Cir.1984); Comfort v. Lynn Sch.\nComm., 283 F.Supp.2d 328, 364-66 (D.Mass.2003).\n[28] Even when the Supreme Court once approved intermediate scrutiny of \"benign\" racial classifications, it later\noverruled that decision, applying strict scrutiny to all racial classifications. See Metro Broad., Inc. v. FCC, 497\nU.S. 547, 564-65, 110 S.Ct. 2997, 111 L.Ed.2d 445 (1990) (applying intermediate scrutiny to \"benign\" race-based\nmeasures), overruled by Adarand, 515 U.S. 200, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995).\n[29] Justice Thomas has stated that one proposing to use race must \"define with precision the interest being\nasserted.\" Grutter, 539 U.S. at 354, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Thomas, J., dissenting). No doubt, Justice Thomas\narticulates a virtually unanimous view of the Court on this point. In view of its importance, this Court has set out\nthe Board's precise statement of its interests at the very beginning of this Memorandum Opinion and repeats it\nhere: \nTo give all students the benefits of an education in a racially integrated school and to maintain community\ncommitment to the entire school system precisely express the Board's own vision of Brown's promise. The\nbenefits the JCPS hopes to achieve go to the heart of its educational mission: (1) a better academic education for\nall students; (2) better appreciation of our political and cultural heritage for all students; (3) more competitive and\nattractive public schools; and (4) broader community support for all JCPS schools. Mem. Op., at 1-2.\n[30] The Supreme Court has broadly endorsed the importance of local control of public education. This Court\nagrees with that view. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490, 112 S.Ct. 1430 (\"As we have long observed, `local\nautonomy of school districts is a vital national tradition.' Returning schools to the control of local authorities at the\nearliest practicable date is essential to restore their true accountability in our governmental system. When the\nschool district and all state entities participating with it in operating the schools make decisions in the absence of\njudicial supervision, they can be held accountable to the citizenry, to the political process, and to the courts in the\nordinary course.\") (citation omitted); Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248, 111 S.Ct. 630 (\"Local control over the education of\nchildren allows citizens to participate in decisionmaking, and allows innovation so that school programs can fit\nlocal needs.\"); Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. at 481, 102 S.Ct. 3187 (\"[N]o single tradition in public education\nis more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools....\") (quoting Milliken, 418 U.S. at 741, 94\nS.Ct. 3112); Brinkman, 433 U.S. at 410, 97 S.Ct. 2766 (\"[O]ur cases have ... firmly recognized that local\nautonomy of school districts is a vital national tradition.\"); Milliken, 418 U.S. at 741-42, 94 S.Ct. 3112 (\"No single\ntradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools; local\nautonomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of community concern and support for public\nschools and to quality of the educational process.\"); Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 49-50, 93 S.Ct. 1278 (\"[Local control\nof schools offers] the opportunity ... for participation in the decisionmaking process that determines how those\nlocal tax dollars will be spent.... Pluralism also affords some opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and a\nhealthy competition for educational excellence.\").\n[31] Justice Powell first expressed the idea that a university's right to determine its own student body was\naccorded some special consideration under the First Amendment. Regents of the Univ. of Calif. v. Bakke, 438\nU.S. 265, 312-14, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978). In Grutter, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the idea that\nacademic freedom grounded in the First Amendment supported some deference to the university. Grutter, 539\n\nU.S. at 329, 123 S.Ct. 2325. In the different context of public school education, that concept of deference is not\nrelevant here.\n[32] Justice Thomas has argued that deference is contradictory to the very idea of strict scrutiny. Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 362, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Thomas, J., dissenting). For instance, he said that while a state may opt to create\nan elite law school, it has no compelling interest to do so. Id. at 357-58, 123 S.Ct. 2325. He said that \"there is no\npressing public necessity in maintaining a public law school at all.\" Id. at 357, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Public elementary\nand secondary school education, however, is an entirely different matter. Educating the community's children is\nnot optional. It is essential to all facets of this community's growth and future. JCPS's interests are precisely\nthose which Justice Thomas found absent at the Michigan Law School 00 educating all students who live in the\n97\ncommunity. This Court therefore concludes that strict scrutiny and limited deference are compatible here.\n[33] Richard Kluger, Simple Justice: The History ofBrown v. Board of Educationand Black America's Struggle for\nEquality 710 (1975).\n[34] In offering assistance to local educational agencies in setting up magnet schools, Congress specifically\nnoted that \n[i]t is in the best interests of the United States ... to continue the Federal Government's support of local\neducational agencies that are implementing court-ordered desegregation plans and local educational agencies\nthat are voluntarily seeking to foster meaningful interaction among students of different racial and ethnic\nbackgrounds ... [;] to ensure that all students have equitable access to a high quality education that will prepare\nall students to function well in ... a highly competitive economy comprised of people from many different racial\nand ethnic backgrounds; and ... to continue to desegregate and diversify schools by supporting magnet\nschools....\n20 U.S.C. § 7231(a)(4). Congress further noted that the purpose of this particular section of the bill was \"to assist\nin the desegregation of schools ... by providing financial assistance to eligible local educational agencies for ...\nthe elimination, reduction, or prevention of minority group isolation in elementary schools and secondary schools\nwith substantial proportions of minority students\" and for \"the development and design of innovative educational\nmethods and practices that promote diversity.\" Id. § 7231(b)(1), (3).\n[35] Justice Scalia calls these benefits merely \"a lesson of life\" as opposed to an \"educational benefit.\" Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 347, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (dissenting, Scalia, J.). Such lessons are pretty important for most people who\nare fortunate enough to learn them early in life. These are precisely the lessons that JCPS hopes its students will\nabsorb. JCPS is not attempting to cure \"general societal ills\" but, rather; to prepare its students for dealing with\nthem. Id. at 371, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (dissenting, Thomas, J.).\n[36] Purely as a matter of evidence, JCPS more than carried its burden on this issue. Numerous witnesses\ntestified about the value of these benefits. Plaintiffs offered nothing to the contrary.\n[37] For instance, in Grutter, Justice Thomas strenuously objected to the idea that a diverse student body or\nintegrated school system is necessary for Black students to achieve success. He asserted his own view that\n\"blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators.\" Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 350, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Thomas, J., dissenting). In an earlier desegregation case, he said: \nGiven that desegregation has not produced the predicted leaps forward in black educational achievement, there\nis no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when surrounded by members of their own race as\nwhen they are in an integrated environment.\nMissouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 121-22, 115 S.Ct. 2038, 132 L.Ed.2d 63 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring).\nJustice Thomas's views of educational policy fall among the huge body of conflicting opinions about the benefits\nof racial integration.\n[38]See Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 75, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting).\n[39] Once again, Plaintiffs completely failed to introduce evidence that integration is only a neutral factor. All of\nthe testimony of school officials and experts suggested that the fully integrated school system has helped achieve\n\nsystemwide gains. Plaintiffs introduced no contrary evidence. All that matters is that the Board has valid reasons\nfor believing its policies have succeeded.\n[40] Presumably, Plaintiffs could have challenged the argument that integrated schools are not valuable to the\nsystem as a whole. No one, however, made that argument, and not one witness came forward to offer such a\nview. By contrast, JCPS offered numerous of its own witnesses and two expert witnesses to testify that integrated\nschools strengthen and make the entire school system more attractive. To find otherwise would require the Court\nto ignore every bit of testimony on the subject. As a matter of evidence, the Court's finding is compelled.\n[41] To be sure, the constitutionality of a policy is not determined by its popularity. These numbers merely\ndemonstrate that JCPS's reasons have some validity. In 2000, a confidential survey of high school juniors was\nconducted for JCPS to record the benefits of a racially integrated school system. Over 90% of the students who\nreceived the survey responded. Approximately 92% of White students and 96% of Black students reported that\nthey were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" working with students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.\nOver 80% of Black and White students who responded said their school experience helped them learn how to\nrelate to students from other racial groups. And over 90% of respondents in each group reported that they would\nbe comfortable working under a supervisor of a different race as an adult.\n[42] Plaintiffs did not introduce evidence in either the Hampton case or this case that suggested the Board's\nmotives were illegitimate, improper or insincere in any manner.\n[43] In his dissent in Grutter, Justice Kennedy made this point: \nThe [majority] confuses deference to a university's definition of its educational objective with deference to the\nimplementation of this goal. In the context of university admissions the objective of racial diversity can be\naccepted based on empirical data known to us, but deference is not to be given with respect to the methods by\nwhich it is pursued.\n539 U.S. at 388, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). The Court agrees with Justice Kennedy's observation\nand will recognize that distinction in its narrow tailoring analysis.\n[44] While the Supreme Court often overlapped its discussion of the first and second factors, see Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 334-39, 123 S.Ct. 2325, for the sake of clarity, this Court separately discusses each of those factors.\n[45] A quota is \"the share or proportional part of a total that is required\" or \"the number or percentage of persons\nof a specified kind permitted to enroll in a college, join a club, immigrate to a country, etc.\" Random House\nUnabridged Dictionary 1588 (2d ed.1993).\n[46] The range in the Black student population in JCPS is between 20.1% and 50.4%, which is much broader\nnumerically than the range in minority admissions at Amherst College. However, that is not a fair comparison\nbecause the range in JCPS percentages is larger overall. The best comparison is to determine the percentage\ndeviation of each range from its mean. At Amherst, the mean percentage between 13.1% and 8.5% is 10.8%.\nThe range extends 2.3% on either side, or about 21.2% on either side of the mean. The JCPS mean between\n50.4% and 20.1% is 35.2%. The range extends 15.1% either side, or about 43% of either side of the mean.\nTherefore, the Amherst College range in minority admissions that Justice Kennedy viewed as not constituting a\nquota is, by comparison, much narrower than the range in the Black student population in JCPS schools.\n[47] Justice Powell contrasted the situation of the applicant in Bakke rejected by his preferred medical school\nagainst that of a public school student sent away from his neighborhood school: \"[The applicant's] position is\nwholly dissimilar to that of a pupil bused from his neighborhood school to a comparable school in another\nneighborhood in compliance with a desegregation decree. [The medical school] did not arrange for [Allan Bakke]\nto attend a different medical school in order to desegregate Davis Medical School; instead, it denied him\nadmission and may have deprived him altogether of a medical education.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. at 300 n. 39, 98 S.Ct.\n2733.\n[48] Likewise, Plaintiff Crystal Meredith's son, Joshua McDonald, was not unduly harmed when JCPS denied his\ntransfer from Young to Bloom under the racial guidelines. He was not denied any benefit because he was denied\n\na transfer between equal and integrated schools. Furthermore, race was only a \"tipping\" factor in denying\nJoshua's transfer request. JCPS took into account his address and school preference when he applied to attend\nhis resides school at Breckinridge-Franklin, a request which was denied because the school was full. Next,\nJoshua had stated no additional preferences for other schools in his cluster, so he was then assigned to Young\n(he applied right before the school year began and had already missed the deadline for magnet and optional\nprograms). Once he was assigned, he applied to transfer to Bloom, a school outside of his cluster. Here, the\nracial guidelines factored into his assignment. They did so, however, only with respect to his third choice and\nafter JCPS had already considered other factors in denying his application to Breckinridge-Franklin. There was\nno evidence that Joshua's transfer request from Young would have been consistently denied under the racial\nguidelines had he applied for further transfers to different schools that same year. And, there was no evidence\nthat Joshua's transfer request would have been denied had he applied the following year for his resides school at\nBreckinridge-Franklin, another cluster school, a magnet or optional program or a transfer.\n[49] In 2002-2003, about 9.3% of all JCPS students were enrolled in the traditional program.\n[50] That race becomes more significant in the traditional school assignment process is, overall, borne out by\nadmission statistics. Black applicants generally have a higher chance of acceptance to traditional schools than\nWhite applicants because they apply in smaller numbers.\n[51] For instance, in 2002-2003, 34% of the applicants to Carter were Black, and Blacks made up 35.4% of the\nstudents there. At Schaffner, 28% of the applicants were Black, and Black students were 32.2% of the population.\nAt Barret, 24% of the applicants were Black, and Black students were 27.9% of the population. At Jefferson\nCounty Traditional, 23% of the applicants were Black, and Blacks made up 26.4% of the student population. In\n2003-2004, 33% of the applicants to Carter were Black, and Blacks made up 33.1% of the students. At Schaffner,\n30% of the applicants were Black, and Black students were 32% of the population. At Barret, 30% of the\napplicants were Black, and Black students were 29.5% of the population. At Jefferson County Traditional, 32% of\nthe applicants were Black, and Blacks made up 29.2% of the student population. \nIn both years, Johnson was the only school where the percentage of Black applicants was noticeably larger than\nthe percentage of Black students at the school. In 2002-2003, 34% of the applicants were Black, and Blacks\nmade up 28.6% of the students. In 2003-2004, 39% of the applicants were Black, and Blacks made up 28.5% of\nthe students. By contrast, in both years, Audubon and Greathouse/Shryock were the only schools where the\npercentage of Black applicants was visibly lower. In 2002-2003, 23% of the applicants to Audubon were Black,\nand Black students were 33.2% of the population 00 a ten-point difference. At Greathouse, 17% of the applicants\n97\nwere Black, and 24.1% of the students were Black 00 a seven-point difference. In 2003-2004, 22% of the\n97\napplicants to Audubon were Black, and 32.9% of the students were Black 00 nearly an eleven-point difference. At\n97\nGreathouse, 17% of the applicants were Black, and 22.3% of the students were Black 00 a five-point difference. In\n97\n2002-2003, Blacks likewise applied to Butler in numbers (12%) noticeably lower than their representation in the\nschool population (20.8%). But, Butler rebounded in 2003-2004 when 19% of the applicants were Black, and\n20.1% of the students were Black.\nIn all cases, however, the percentage of Black applicants fell within the racial guidelines (with the one exception\nof Butler in 2002-2003). Louisville Male was excepted from these statistics because it typically only has enough\nspace for those students already in the \"pipeline\" and thus rarely accepts new applicants.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \nPARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v. \n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1 ET AL. \n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE NINTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 05–908.  Argued December 4, 2006—Decided June 28, 2007* \nRespondent school districts voluntarily adopted student assignment\nplans that rely on race to determine which schools certain children \nmay attend.  The Seattle district, which has never operated legally\nsegregated schools or been subject to court-ordered desegregation,\nclassified children as white or nonwhite, and used the racial classifi-\ncations as a “tiebreaker” to allocate slots in particular high schools. \nThe Jefferson County, Ky., district was subject to a desegregation de-\ncree until 2000, when the District Court dissolved the decree after \nfinding that the district had eliminated the vestiges of prior segrega-\ntion to the greatest extent practicable.  In 2001, the district adopted\nits plan classifying students as black or “other” in order to make cer-\ntain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests. \nPetitioners, an organization of Seattle parents (Parents Involved)\nand the mother of a Jefferson County student (Joshua), whose chil-\ndren were or could be assigned under the foregoing plans, filed these \nsuits contending, inter alia, that allocating children to different pub-\nlic schools based solely on their race violates the Fourteenth Amend-\nment’s equal protection guarantee.  In the Seattle case, the District \nCourt granted the school district summary judgment, finding, inter \nalia, that its plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal constitu-\ntional claim because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\ngovernment interest.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In the Jefferson \nCounty case, the District Court found that the school district had as-\n—————— \n*Together with No. 05–915, Meredith, Custodial Parent and Next \nFriend of McDonald v. Jefferson County Bd. of Ed et al., on certiorari to \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. \n\n2  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nSyllabus \n\nserted a compelling interest in maintaining racially diverse schools, \nand that its plan was, in all relevant respects, narrowly tailored to\nserve that interest.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed.    \nHeld: The judgments are reversed, and the cases are remanded. \nNo. 05–908, 426 F. 3d 1162; No. 05–915, 416 F. 3d 513, reversed and \nremanded. \nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\nto Parts I, II, III–A, and III–C, concluding: \n1. The Court has jurisdiction in these cases.  Seattle argues that \nParents  Involved  lacks  standing  because  its  current  members’ \nclaimed injuries are not imminent and are too speculative in that,\neven if the district maintains its current plan and reinstitutes the ra-\ncial tiebreaker, those members will only be affected if their children \nseek to enroll in a high school that is oversubscribed and integration\npositive.  This argument is unavailing; the group’s members have \nchildren in all levels of the district’s schools, and the complaint \nsought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of members whose\nelementary and middle school children may be denied admission to \nthe high schools of their choice in the future.  The fact that those \nchildren may not be denied such admission based on their race be-\ncause of undersubscription or oversubscription that benefits them \ndoes not eliminate the injury claimed.  The group also asserted an in-\nterest in not being forced to compete in a race-based system that \nmight prejudice its members’ children, an actionable form of injury\nunder the Equal Protection Clause, see, e.g., Adarand Constructors, \nInc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 211.  The fact that Seattle has ceased us-\ning the racial tiebreaker pending the outcome here is not dispositive,\nsince the district vigorously defends its program’s constitutionality,\nand nowhere suggests that it will not resume using race to assign\nstudents if it prevails.  See Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envi-\nronmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 189.  Similarly, the \nfact that Joshua has been granted a transfer does not eliminate the \nCourt’s jurisdiction; Jefferson County’s racial guidelines apply at all \ngrade levels and he may again be subject to race-based assignment in\nmiddle school.  Pp. 9–11.\n2. The school districts have not carried their heavy burden of show-\ning that the interest they seek to achieve justifies the extreme means\nthey have chosen—discriminating among individual students based \non race by relying upon racial classifications in making school as-\nsignments.  Pp. 11–17, 25–28.   \n(a) Because “racial classifications are simply too pernicious to per-\nmit any but the most exact connection between justification and clas-\nsification,” Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 537 (STEVENS, J., \ndissenting), governmental distributions of burdens or benefits based \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  3 \nSyllabus \non individual racial classifications are reviewed under strict scrutiny, \ne.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 505–506.  Thus, the school \ndistricts must demonstrate that their use of such classifications is \n“narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compelling” government interest. \nAdarand, supra, at 227. \nAlthough remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination\nis a compelling interest under the strict scrutiny test, see Freeman v. \nPitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494, that interest is not involved here because \nthe Seattle schools were never segregated by law nor subject to court-\nordered desegregation, and the desegregation decree to which the Jef-\nferson County schools were previously subject has been dissolved.\nMoreover, these cases are not governed by Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 \nU. S. 306, 328, in which the Court held that, for strict scrutiny pur-\nposes, a government interest in student body diversity “in the context \nof higher education” is compelling.  That interest was not focused on \nrace alone but encompassed “all factors that may contribute to stu-\ndent body diversity,” id., at 337, including, e.g., having “overcome \npersonal adversity and family hardship,” id., at 338.  Quoting Justice \nPowell’s articulation of diversity in Regents of the University of Cali-\nfornia v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 314–315, the Grutter Court noted that \n“ ‘it is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified \npercentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members \nof selected ethnic groups,’ that can justify the use of race,” 539 U. S.,\nat 324–325, but “ ‘a far broader array of qualifications and character-\nistics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important \nelement, ’ ” id., at 325.  In the present cases, by contrast, race is not\nconsidered as part of a broader effort to achieve “exposure to widely\ndiverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,” id., at 330; race, for \nsome students, is determinative standing alone.  The districts argue \nthat other factors, such as student preferences, affect assignment de-\ncisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into\nplay, it is decisive by itself.  It is not simply one factor weighed with\nothers in reaching a decision, as in Grutter; it is the factor. See Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 275.  Even as to race, the plans here em-\nploy only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in\nwhite/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/“other” terms in Jefferson \nCounty.  The Grutter Court expressly limited its holding—defining a \nspecific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique context\nof higher education—but these limitations were largely disregarded \nby the lower courts in extending Grutter to the sort of classifications \nat issue here.  Pp. 11–17. \n(b) Despite the districts’ assertion that they employed individual\nracial classifications in a way necessary to achieve their stated ends,\nthe minimal effect these classifications have on student assignments \n\n4  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nSyllabus \n\nsuggests that other means would be effective.  Seattle’s racial tie-\nbreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of stu-\ndents between schools.  Similarly, Jefferson County admits that its \nuse of racial classifications has had a minimal effect, and claims only\nthat its guidelines provide a firm definition of the goal of racially in-\ntegrated schools, thereby providing administrators with authority to\ncollaborate with principals and staff to maintain schools within the\ndesired range.  Classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to\na binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of this \nCourt’s precedents and the Nation’s history of using race in public \nschools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it.\nIn Grutter, in contrast, the consideration of race was viewed as indis-\npensable in more than tripling minority representation at the law\nschool there at issue.  See 539 U. S., at 320.  While the Court does not \nsuggest that greater use of race would be preferable, the minimal im-\npact of the districts’ racial classifications on school enrollment casts \ndoubt on the necessity of using such classifications.  The districts \nhave also failed to show they considered methods other than explicit\nracial classifications to achieve their stated goals.  Narrow tailoring \nrequires “serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives,” id., at 339, and yet in Seattle several alternative as-\nsignment plans—many of which would not have used express racial\nclassifications—were rejected with little or no consideration.  Jeffer-\nson County has failed to present any evidence that it considered al-\nternatives, even though the district already claims that its goals are\nachieved primarily through means other than the racial classifica-\ntions.  Pp. 25–28. \nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE THOMAS, and \nJUSTICE ALITO, concluded for additional reasons in Parts III–B and IV \nthat the plans at issue are unconstitutional under this Court’s prece-\ndents.  Pp. 17–25, 28–41.  \n1. The Court need not resolve the parties’ dispute over whether ra-\ncial diversity in schools has a marked impact on test scores and other \nobjective yardsticks or achieves intangible socialization benefits be-\ncause it is clear that the racial classifications at issue are not nar-\nrowly tailored to the asserted goal.  In design and operation, the \nplans are directed only to racial balance, an objective this Court has \nrepeatedly condemned as illegitimate.  They are tied to each district’s\nspecific racial demographics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of \nthe level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational bene-\nfits.  Whatever those demographics happen to be drives the required \n“diversity” number in each district.  The districts offer no evidence \nthat the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve the asserted \neducational benefits happens to coincide with the racial demograph-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  5 \nSyllabus \nics of the respective districts, or rather the districts’ white/nonwhite\nor black/“other” balance, since that is the only diversity addressed by\nthe plans.  In Grutter, the number of minority students the school \nsought to admit was an undefined “meaningful number” necessary to\nachieve a genuinely diverse student body, 539 U. S., at 316, 335–336, \nand the Court concluded that the law school did not count back from \nits applicant pool to arrive at that number, id., at 335–336.  Here, in \ncontrast, the schools worked backward to achieve a particular type of \nracial balance, rather than working forward from some demonstra-\ntion of the level of diversity that provides the purported benefits.\nThis is a fatal flaw under the Court’s existing precedent.  See, e.g., \nFreeman, supra, at 494.  Accepting racial balancing as a compelling\nstate interest would justify imposing racial proportionality through-\nout American society, contrary to the Court’s repeated admonitions \nthat this is unconstitutional.  While the school districts use various \nverbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to promote—\nracial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration—they \noffer no definition suggesting that their interest differs from racial \nbalancing.  Pp. 17–25.\n2. If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school\ndistricts is unclear, even on the districts’ own terms, the costs are \nundeniable.  Government action dividing people by race is inherently\nsuspect because such classifications promote “notions of racial inferi-\nority and lead to a politics of racial hostility,” Croson, supra, at 493, \n“reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history,\nthat individuals should be judged by the color of their skin,” Shaw v. \nReno, 509 U. S. 630, 657, and “endorse race-based reasoning and the \nconception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to\nan escalation of racial hostility and conflict,” Metro Broadcasting, Inc. \nv. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 603 (O’Connor, J., dissenting).  When it comes \nto using race to assign children to schools, history will be heard.  In \nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, the Court held that seg-\nregation deprived black children of equal educational opportunities \nregardless of whether school facilities and other tangible factors were \nequal, because the classification and separation themselves denoted\ninferiority.  Id., at 493–494.  It was not the inequality of the facilities\nbut the fact of legally separating children based on race on which the\nCourt relied to find a constitutional violation in that case.  Id., at 494. \nThe districts here invoke the ultimate goal of those who filed Brown \nand subsequent cases to support their argument, but the argument of\nthe plaintiff in Brown was that the Equal Protection Clause “pre-\nvents states from according differential treatment to American chil-\ndren on the basis of their color or race,” and that view prevailed—this\nCourt ruled in its remedial opinion that Brown required school dis-\n\n6  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nSyllabus \n\ntricts “to achieve a system of determining admission to the public\nschools on a nonracial basis.”  Brown v. Board of Education, 349 \nU. S. 294, 300–301 (emphasis added).  Pp. 28–41. \nJUSTICE KENNEDY agreed that the Court has jurisdiction to decide \nthese cases and that respondents’ student assignment plans are not\nnarrowly tailored to achieve the compelling goal of diversity properly \ndefined, but concluded that some parts of the plurality opinion imply\nan unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances \nwhen it may be taken into account. Pp. 1–9.\n(a) As part of its burden of proving that racial classifications are\nnarrowly tailored to further compelling interests, the government \nmust establish, in detail, how decisions based on an individual stu-\ndent’s race are made in a challenged program.  The Jefferson County \nBoard of Education fails to meet this threshold mandate when it con-\ncedes it denied Joshua’s requested kindergarten transfer on the basis\nof his race under its guidelines, yet also maintains that the guide-\nlines do not apply to kindergartners.  This discrepancy is not some \nsimple and straightforward error that touches only upon the periph-\neries of the district’s use of individual racial classifications.  As be-\ncomes clearer when the district’s plan is further considered, Jefferson \nCounty has explained how and when it employs these classifications \nonly in terms so broad and imprecise that they cannot withstand\nstrict scrutiny.  In its briefing it fails to make clear—even in the lim-\nited respects implicated by Joshua’s initial assignment and transfer\ndenial—whether in fact it relies on racial classifications in a manner \nnarrowly tailored to the interest in question, rather than in the far-\nreaching, inconsistent, and ad hoc manner that a less forgiving read-\ning of the record would suggest.  When a court subjects governmental\naction to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambiguities in favor of the \ngovernment.  In the Seattle case, the school district has gone further\nin describing the methods and criteria used to determine assignment\ndecisions based on individual racial classifications, but it has never-\ntheless failed to explain why, in a district composed of a diversity of \nraces, with only a minority of the students classified as “white,” it has\nemployed the crude racial categories of “white” and “non-white” as \nthe basis for its assignment decisions.  Far from being narrowly tai-\nlored, this system threatens to defeat its own ends, and the district\nhas provided no convincing explanation for its design.  Pp. 2–6. \n(b) The plurality opinion is too dismissive of government’s legiti-\nmate interest in ensuring that all people have equal opportunity re-\ngardless of their race.  In administering public schools, it is permissi-\nble to consider the schools’ racial makeup and adopt general policies \nto encourage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial\ncomposition.  Cf. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306.  School authori-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  7 \nSyllabus \nties concerned that their student bodies’ racial compositions interfere\nwith offering an equal educational opportunity to all are free to de-\nvise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general way \nand without treating each student in different fashion based solely on\na systematic, individual typing by race.  Such measures may include \nstrategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with\ngeneral  recognition  of  neighborhood  demographics;  allocating  re-\nsources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a tar-\ngeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other sta-\ntistics by race.   \nEach respondent has failed to provide the necessary support for the \nproposition that there is no other way than individual racial classifi-\ncations to avoid racial isolation in their school districts.  Cf. Rich-\nmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 501.  In these cases, the fact \nthat the number of students whose assignment depends on express\nracial classifications is small suggests that the schools could have\nachieved their stated ends through different means, including the fa-\ncially race-neutral means set forth above or, if necessary, a more nu-\nanced, individual evaluation of school needs and student characteris-\ntics that might include race as a component.  The latter approach \nwould be informed by Grutter, though the criteria relevant to student \nplacement  would  differ  based  on  the  students’  age,  the  parents’\nneeds, and the schools’ role.

The \nSeattle school district classifies children as white or non-\nwhite;  the  Jefferson  County  school  district  as  black  or \n“other.”  In Seattle, this racial classification is used to \n\n2  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

In Jefferson \nCounty,  it  is  used  to  make  certain  elementary  school \nassignments and to rule on transfer requests.  In each \ncase, the school district relies upon an individual student’s\nrace in assigning that student to a particular school, so \nthat the racial balance at the school falls within a prede-\ntermined  range  based  on  the  racial  composition  of  the\nschool  district  as  a  whole.  Parents  of  students  denied \nassignment to particular schools under these plans solely\nbecause of their race brought suit, contending that allocat-\ning children to different public schools on the basis of race \nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal \nprotection.  The Courts of Appeals below upheld the plans. \nWe granted certiorari, and now reverse. \nI \nBoth cases present the same underlying legal question—\nwhether  a  public  school  that  had  not  operated  legally \nsegregated schools or has been found to be unitary may \nchoose  to  classify  students  by  race  and  rely  upon  that\nclassification in making school assignments.  Although we\nexamine the plans under the same legal framework, the \nspecifics  of  the  two  plans,  and  the  circumstances \nsurrounding  their  adoption,  are  in  some  respects  quite\ndifferent. \nA \nSeattle School District No. 1 operates 10 regular public\nhigh schools.  In 1998, it adopted the plan at issue in this\ncase for assigning students to these schools.

If too many \nstudents  list  the  same  school  as  their  first  choice,  the \ndistrict employs a series of “tiebreakers” to determine who \nwill fill the open slots at the oversubscribed school.  The \nfirst tiebreaker selects for admission students who have a \nsibling currently enrolled in the chosen school.  The next \ntiebreaker  depends  upon  the  racial  composition  of  the \nparticular school and the race of the individual student. \nIn the district’s public schools approximately 41 percent of \nenrolled  students  are  white;  the  remaining  59  percent,\ncomprising all other racial groups, are classified by Seattle \nfor assignment purposes as nonwhite.  Id., at 38a, 103a.2 \nIf an oversubscribed school is not within 10 percentage\npoints of the district’s overall white/nonwhite racial bal-\nance, it is what the district calls “integration positive,” and\nthe district employs a tiebreaker that selects for assign-\nment students whose race “will serve to bring the school \ninto balance.”  Id., at 38a.  See Parents Involved VII, 426 \nF. 3d 1162, 1169–1170 (CA9 2005) (en banc).3  If it is still \nnecessary to select students for the school after using the \nracial  tiebreaker,  the  next  tiebreaker  is  the  geographic\nproximity of the school to the student’s residence.  App. in\nNo. 05–908, at 38a. \nSeattle has never operated segregated schools—legally \n—————— \nyear in evaluating the plan.  See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1169–1171 (CA9 2005) \n(en banc) (Parents Involved VII). \n2The racial breakdown of this nonwhite group is approximately 23.8 \npercent Asian-American, 23.1 percent African-American, 10.3 percent \nLatino, and 2.8 percent Native-American.  See 377 F. 3d 949, 1005– \n1006 (CA9 2004) (Parents Involved VI) (Graber, J., dissenting). \n3For the 2001–2002 school year, the deviation permitted from the \ndesired racial composition was increased from 10 to 15 percent.  App. in \nNo. 05–908, p. 38a.  The bulk of the data in the record was collected \nusing the 10 percent band, see n. 1, supra. \n\n4  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

It none-\ntheless  employs  the  racial  tiebreaker  in  an  attempt  to\naddress the effects of racially identifiable housing patterns \non school assignments.  Most white students live in the \nnorthern  part  of  Seattle,  most  students  of  other  racial\nbackgrounds in the southern part.  Parents Involved VII, \nsupra, at 1166.  Four of Seattle’s high schools are located \nin the north—Ballard, Nathan Hale, Ingraham, and Roo-\nsevelt—and five in the south—Rainier Beach, Cleveland, \nWest Seattle, Chief Sealth, and Franklin.  One school— \nGarfield—is more or less in the center of Seattle.  App. in \nNo. 05–908, at 38a–39a, 45a. \nFor  the  2000–2001  school  year,  five  of  these  schools\nwere  oversubscribed—Ballard,  Nathan  Hale,  Roosevelt, \nGarfield,  and  Franklin—so  much  so  that  82  percent  of \nincoming  ninth  graders  ranked  one  of  these  schools  as\ntheir first choice.  Id., at 38a.  Three of the oversubscribed \nschools  were  “integration  positive”  because  the  school’s \nwhite  enrollment  the  previous  school  year  was  greater \nthan 51 percent—Ballard, Nathan Hale, and Roosevelt.\nThus, more nonwhite students (107, 27, and 82, respec-\ntively) who selected one of these three schools as a top \nchoice received placement at the school than would have\nbeen the case had race not been considered, and proximity \nbeen the next tiebreaker.  Id., at 39a–40a.  Franklin was \n“integration positive” because its nonwhite enrollment the \nprevious school year was greater than 69 percent; 89 more\nwhite students were assigned to Franklin by operation of \nthe racial tiebreaker in the 2000–2001 school year than\notherwise would have been.  Ibid.  Garfield was the only\noversubscribed school whose composition during the 1999–\n2000  school  year  was  within  the  racial  guidelines,  al-\nthough in previous years Garfield’s enrollment had been\npredominantly  nonwhite,  and  the  racial  tiebreaker  had \nbeen used to give preference to white students.

The concerns of Parents Involved \nare illustrated by Jill Kurfirst, who sought to enroll her \nninth-grade son, Andy Meeks, in Ballard High School’s \nspecial  Biotechnology  Career  Academy.    Andy  suffered  \nfrom attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia,\nbut had made good progress with hands-on instruction, \nand his mother and middle school teachers thought that \nthe smaller biotechnology program held the most promise \nfor his continued success.  Andy was accepted into this \nselective program but, because of the racial tiebreaker,\nwas denied assignment to Ballard High School.  Id., at \n143a–146a, 152a–160a.  Parents Involved commenced this \nsuit in the Western District of Washington, alleging that\nSeattle’s use of race in assignments violated the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,4 Title VI \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964,5 and the Washington Civil\nRights Act.6  Id., at 28a–35a.  \nThe District Court granted summary judgment to the\nschool district, finding that state law did not bar the dis-\ntrict’s use of the racial tiebreaker and that the plan sur-\nvived strict scrutiny on the federal constitutional claim \nbecause  it  was  narrowly  tailored  to  serve  a  compelling \n—————— \n4“No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the \nequal protection of the laws.”  U.

Board of Ed. of Jefferson Cty., 489 F. 2d \n925,  932  (CA6),  vacated  and  remanded,  418  U. S.  918, \nreinstated with modifications, 510 F. 2d 1358, 1359 (CA6\n1974), and in 1975 the District Court entered a desegrega-\ntion decree.  See Hampton v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed., 72 \nF. Supp.  2d  753,  762–764  (WD  Ky.  1999).    Jefferson \nCounty operated under this decree until 2000, when the \nDistrict Court dissolved the decree after finding that the \ndistrict had achieved unitary status by eliminating “[t]o \nthe greatest extent practicable” the vestiges of its prior \npolicy of segregation.  Hampton v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of \nEd., 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 360 (2000).  See Board of Ed. of \nOklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, \n249–250 (1991); Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391 \nU. S. 430, 435–436 (1968).\nIn 2001, after the decree had been dissolved, Jefferson \nCounty adopted the voluntary student assignment plan at \nissue in this case.  App. in No. 05–915, p. 77.  Approxi-\nmately  34  percent  of  the  district’s  97,000  students  are\nblack;  most  of  the  remaining  66  percent  are  white. \nMcFarland v. Jefferson Cty. Public Schools, 330 F.

The district assigns students to nonmagnet \nschools  in  one  of  two  ways:  Parents  of  kindergartners, \nfirst-graders, and students new to the district may submit\nan application indicating a first and second choice among \nthe schools within their cluster; students who do not sub-\nmit such an application are assigned within the cluster by\nthe  district.    “Decisions  to  assign  students  to  schools \nwithin each cluster are based on available space within\nthe  schools  and  the  racial  guidelines  in  the  District’s \ncurrent student assignment plan.”  Id., at 38.  If a school \nhas  reached  the  “extremes  of  the  racial  guidelines,”  a \nstudent whose race would contribute to the school’s racial \nimbalance will not be assigned there.  Id., at 38–39, 82. \nAfter assignment, students at all grade levels are permit-\nted to apply to transfer between nonmagnet schools in the \ndistrict.  Transfers may be requested for any number of\nreasons, and may be denied because of lack of available \nspace or on the basis of the racial guidelines.  Id., at 43.7 \nWhen petitioner Crystal Meredith moved into the school \ndistrict  in  August  2002,  she  sought  to  enroll  her  son, \nJoshua  McDonald,  in  kindergarten  for  the  2002–2003 \nschool year.  His resides school was only a mile from his \nnew  home,  but  it  had  no  available  space—assignments\nhad been made in May, and the class was full.  Jefferson \nCounty assigned Joshua to another elementary school in\nhis cluster, Young Elementary.  This school was 10 miles \nfrom home, and Meredith sought to transfer Joshua to a \nschool in a different cluster, Bloom Elementary, which— \n—————— \n7Middle and high school students are designated a single resides \nschool and assigned to that school unless it is at the extremes of the \nracial guidelines.

See \nTr. in McFarland I, pp. 1–49 through 1–54 (Dec. 8, 2003). \nSpace was available at Bloom, and intercluster transfers\nare allowed, but Joshua’s transfer was nonetheless denied \nbecause, in the words of Jefferson County, “[t]he transfer\nwould  have  an  adverse  effect  on  desegregation  compli-\nance” of Young.

The  District  Court  found \nthat Jefferson County had asserted a compelling interest \nin maintaining racially diverse schools, and that the as-\nsignment  plan  was  (in  all  relevant  respects)  narrowly \ntailored to serve that compelling interest.  McFarland I, \nsupra, at 837.9  The Sixth Circuit affirmed in a per curiam\nopinion relying upon the reasoning of the District Court,\nconcluding that a written opinion “would serve no useful\npurpose.”  McFarland v.

Seattle argues that Parents Involved lacks \nstanding because none of its current members can claim \nan imminent injury.  Even if the district maintains the \n—————— \n8It  is  not  clear  why  the  racial  guidelines  were  even  applied  to \nJoshua’s transfer application—the guidelines supposedly do not apply \nat the kindergarten level.  Id., at 43.  Neither party disputes, however, \nthat Joshua’s transfer application was denied under the racial guide-\nlines, and Meredith’s objection is not that the guidelines were misap-\nplied but rather that race was used at all. \n9Meredith joined a pending lawsuit filed by several other plaintiffs.\nSee id., at 7–11.  The other plaintiffs all challenged assignments to\ncertain specialized schools, and the District Court found these assign-\nments, which are no longer at issue in this case, unconstitutional. \nMcFarland I, 330 F. Supp. 2d 834, 837, 864 (WD Ky. 2004). \n\n10  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\ncurrent plan and reinstitutes the racial tiebreaker, Seattle \nargues, Parents Involved members will only be affected if \ntheir children seek to enroll in a Seattle public high school \nand choose an oversubscribed school that is integration\npositive—too  speculative  a  harm  to  maintain  standing. \nBrief for Respondents in No. 05–908, pp. 16–17.\nThis  argument  is  unavailing.    The  group’s  members\nhave  children  in  the  district’s  elementary,  middle,  and\nhigh schools, App. in No. 05–908, at 299a–301a; Affidavit \nof  Kathleen  Brose  Pursuant  to  this  Court’s  Rule  32.3 \n(Lodging  of  Petitioner  Parents  Involved),  and  the  com-\nplaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of \nParents Involved members whose elementary and middle \nschool  children  may  be  “denied  admission  to  the  high \nschools of their choice when they apply for those schools in \nthe future,”  App. in No. 05–908, at 30a.  The fact that it is \npossible that children of group members will not be denied \nadmission to a school based on their race—because they\nchoose  an  undersubscribed  school  or  an  oversubscribed \nschool  in  which  their  race  is  an  advantage—does  not \neliminate the injury claimed.  Moreover, Parents Involved \nalso asserted an interest in not being “forced to compete \nfor seats at certain high schools in a system that uses race \nas a deciding factor in many of its admissions decisions.” \nIbid.  As we have held, one form of injury under the Equal\nProtection Clause is being forced to compete in a race-\nbased system that may prejudice the plaintiff, Adarand \nConstructors,  Inc.  v.  Peña,  515  U. S.  200,  211  (1995); \nNortheastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of \nAmerica  v.  Jacksonville,  508  U.

Voluntary cessation\ndoes not moot a case or controversy unless “subsequent\nevents ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrong-\nful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,” \nFriends of Earth, Inc. v.

Although apparently Joshua\nhas now been granted a transfer to Bloom, the school to\nwhich transfer was denied under the racial guidelines, Tr. \nof Oral Arg. in No. 05–915, at 45, the racial guidelines\napply at all grade levels.  Upon Joshua’s enrollment in \nmiddle  school,  he  may  again  be  subject  to  assignment \nbased on his race.  In addition, Meredith sought damages \nin her complaint, which is sufficient to preserve our ability \nto consider the question.  Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. \n95, 109 (1983). \nIII \n\nA \n\nIt is well established that when the government distrib-\nutes burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial \nclassifications, that action is reviewed under strict scru-\ntiny.

As the Court recently reaffirmed, \n“‘racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit\nany but the most exact connection between justification \nand classification.’”  Gratz v.

In \norder  to  satisfy  this  searching  standard  of  review,  the\nschool districts must demonstrate that the use of individ-\nual  racial  classifications  in  the  assignment  plans  here\nunder review is “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compel-\nling” government interest.  Adarand, supra, at 227. \nWithout attempting in these cases to set forth all the\ninterests a school district might assert, it suffices to note\nthat our prior cases, in evaluating the use of racial classi-\nfications in the school context, have recognized two inter-\nests that qualify as compelling.  The first is the compelling \ninterest of remedying the effects of past intentional dis-\ncrimination.  See  Freeman  v.  Pitts,  503  U. S.  467,  494 \n(1992).  Yet the Seattle public schools have not shown that \nthey were ever segregated by law, and were not subject to \ncourt-ordered  desegregation  decrees.    The  Jefferson \nCounty public schools were previously segregated by law \nand  were  subject  to  a  desegregation  decree  entered  in \n1975.  In 2000, the District Court that entered that decree \ndissolved it, finding that Jefferson County had “eliminated \nthe vestiges associated with the former policy of segrega-\ntion  and  its  pernicious  effects,”  and  thus  had  achieved \n“unitary”  status.    Hampton,  102  F. Supp.  2d,  at  360. \nJefferson County accordingly does not rely upon an inter-\nest in remedying the effects of past intentional discrimina-\ntion in defending its present use of race in assigning stu-\ndents.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05–915, at 38. \nNor could it.  We have emphasized that the harm being \nremedied by mandatory desegregation plans is the harm\nthat is traceable to segregation, and that “the Constitution\nis not violated by racial imbalance in the schools, without \nmore.”  Milliken  v.  Bradley,  433  U. S.  267,  280,  n. 14 \n(1977).  See also Freeman, supra, at 495–496; Dowell, 498 \nU. S.,  at  248;  Milliken  v.  Bradley,  418  U. S.  717,  746 \n(1974).  Once Jefferson County achieved unitary status, it \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  13 \nOpinion of the Court \nhad remedied the constitutional wrong that allowed race-\nbased assignments.  Any continued use of race must be\njustified on some other basis.10 \nThe second government interest we have recognized as\ncompelling for purposes of strict scrutiny is the interest in \ndiversity in higher education upheld in Grutter, 539 U. S., \nat 328.  The specific interest found compelling in Grutter \nwas student body diversity “in the context of higher educa-\ntion.”  Ibid.  The diversity interest was not focused on race\nalone but encompassed “all factors that may contribute to\nstudent body diversity.”  Id., at 337.  We described the \nvarious types of diversity that the law school sought: \n“[The law school’s] policy makes clear there are many \npossible bases for diversity admissions, and provides\nexamples  of  admittees  who  have  lived  or  traveled \nwidely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have \n—————— \n10The districts point to dicta in a prior opinion in which the Court\nsuggested  that,  while  not  constitutionally  mandated,  it  would  be \nconstitutionally permissible for a school district to seek racially bal-\nanced schools as a matter of “educational policy.”  See Swann v. Char-\nlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971).  The districts also \nquote with approval an in-chambers opinion in which then-Justice \nRehnquist made a suggestion to the same effect.  See Bustop, Inc. v. Los \nAngeles Bd. of Ed., 439 U. S. 1380, 1383 (1978).  The citations do not \ncarry the significance the districts would ascribe to them.  Swann, \nevaluating a school district engaged in court-ordered desegregation,\nhad no occasion to consider whether a district’s voluntary adoption of \nrace-based assignments in the absence of a finding of prior de jure\nsegregation was constitutionally permissible, an issue that was again \nexpressly reserved in Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 \nU. S. 457, 472, n. 15 (1982).  Bustop, addressing in the context of an\nemergency injunction application a busing plan imposed by the Supe-\nrior Court of Los Angeles County, is similarly unavailing.  Then-Justice \nRehnquist,  in  denying  emergency  relief,  stressed  that  “equitable \nconsideration[s]” counseled against preliminary relief.  439 U. S., at \n1383.  The propriety of preliminary relief and resolution of the merits \nare of course “significantly different” issues.  University of Texas v. \nCamenisch, 451 U. S. 390, 393 (1981). \n\n14  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978), noting that “it is not an\ninterest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified \npercentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to\nbe members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the \nuse of race.”  Grutter, supra, at 324–325 (citing and quot-\ning  Bakke,  supra,  at  314–315  (opinion  of  Powell,  J.); \nbrackets and internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, \nwhat was upheld in Grutter was consideration of “a far \nbroader  array  of  qualifications  and  characteristics  of \nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though impor-\ntant element.”  539 U. S., at 325 (quoting Bakke, supra, \nat 315 (opinion of Powell, J.); internal quotation marks\nomitted).\nThe entire gist of the analysis in Grutter was that the \nadmissions program at issue there focused on each appli-\ncant as an individual, and not simply as a member of a \nparticular racial group.  The classification of applicants by \nrace upheld in Grutter was only as part of a “highly indi-\nvidualized,  holistic  review,”  539  U. S.,  at  337.  As  the \nCourt explained, “[t]he importance of this individualized \nconsideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions \nprogram is paramount.”  Ibid.  The point of the narrow\ntailoring analysis in which the Grutter Court engaged was\nto ensure that the use of racial classifications was indeed \npart of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply \nan effort to achieve racial balance, which the Court ex-\nplained would be “patently unconstitutional.”  Id., at 330. \nIn the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  15 \nOpinion of the Court \nas part of a broader effort to achieve “exposure to widely\ndiverse  people,  cultures,  ideas,  and  viewpoints,”  ibid.; \nrace, for some students, is determinative standing alone.\nThe  districts  argue  that  other  factors,  such  as  student\npreferences, affect assignment decisions under their plans, \nbut under each plan when race comes into play, it is deci-\nsive by itself.  It is not simply one factor weighed with\nothers in reaching a decision, as in Grutter; it is the factor. \nLike  the  University  of  Michigan  undergraduate  plan\nstruck down in Gratz, 539 U. S., at 275, the plans here “do \nnot  provide  for  a  meaningful  individualized  review  of \napplicants” but instead rely on racial classifications in a\n“nonindividualized,  mechanical”  way.    Id.,  at  276,  280 \n(O’Connor, J., concurring). \nEven when it comes to race, the plans here employ only\na limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in\nwhite/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/“other” terms \nin Jefferson County.11  But see Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. \nFCC, 497 U. S. 547, 610 (1990) (“We are a Nation not of \nblack and white alone, but one teeming with divergent \ncommunities knitted together with various traditions and \ncarried  forth,  above  all,  by  individuals”)  (O’Connor,  J., \ndissenting).  The Seattle “Board Statement Reaffirming \nDiversity Rationale” speaks of the “inherent educational \nvalue” in “[p]roviding students the opportunity to attend\nschools with diverse student enrollment,” App. in No. 05–\n908, at 128a, 129a.  But under the Seattle plan, a school\nwith 50 percent Asian-American students and 50 percent \nwhite  students  but  no  African-American,  Native-\nAmerican, or Latino students would qualify as balanced, \n—————— \n11The way Seattle classifies its students bears this out.  Upon enroll-\ning their child with the district, parents are required to identify their\nchild as a member of a particular racial group.  If a parent identifies\nmore than one race on the form, “[t]he application will not be accepted \nand, if necessary, the enrollment service person taking the application \nwill indicate one box.”  App. in No. 05–908, at 303a. \n\n16  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nwhile a school with 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent\nAfrican-American,  25  percent  Latino,  and  20  percent \nwhite students would not.  It is hard to understand how a \nplan that could allow these results can be viewed as being \nconcerned  with  achieving  enrollment  that  is  “‘broadly\ndiverse,’” Grutter, supra, at 329. \n  Prior to Grutter, the courts of appeals rejected as uncon-\nstitutional attempts to implement race-based assignment\nplans—such as the plans at issue here—in primary and \nsecondary schools.  See, e.g., Eisenberg v. Montgomery Cty. \nPublic Schools, 197 F. 3d 123, 133 (CA4 1999); Tuttle v. \nArlington Cty. School Bd., 195 F. 3d 698, 701 (CA4 1999); \nWessman v. Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790, 809 (CA1 1998).  See \nalso Ho v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 147 F. 3d \n854,  865  (CA9  1998).    After  Grutter,  however,  the  two \nCourts of Appeals in these cases, and one other, found that \nrace-based assignments were permissible at the elemen-\ntary and secondary level, largely in reliance on that case. \nSee Parents Involved VII, 426 F. 3d, at 1166; McFarland \nII, 416 F. 3d, at 514; Comfort v. Lynn School Comm., 418 \nF. 3d 1, 13 (CA1 2005).\nIn upholding the admissions plan in Grutter, though,\nthis Court relied upon considerations unique to institu-\ntions of higher education, noting that in light of “the ex-\npansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with\nthe university environment, universities occupy a special \nniche in our constitutional tradition.”  539 U. S., at 329. \nSee also Bakke, supra, at 312, 313 (opinion of Powell, J.).\nThe Court explained that “[c]ontext matters” in applying\nstrict scrutiny, and repeatedly noted that it was address-\ning the use of race “in the context of higher education.” \nGrutter, supra, at 327, 328, 334.  The Court in Grutter \nexpressly  articulated  key  limitations  on  its  holding—\ndefining a specific type of broad-based diversity and noting \nthe unique context of higher education—but these limita-\ntions  were  largely  disregarded  by  the  lower  courts  in \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  17 \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u Crt. J. \nextending  Grutter  to  uphold  race-based  assignments  in \nelementary and secondary schools.  The present cases are \nnot governed by Grutter. \nB \nPerhaps  recognizing  that  reliance  on  Grutter  cannot \nsustain their plans, both school districts assert additional \ninterests, distinct from the interest upheld in Grutter, to \njustify  their  race-based  assignments.  In  briefing  and \nargument before this Court, Seattle contends that its use \nof race helps to reduce racial concentration in schools and \nto ensure that racially concentrated housing patterns do\nnot prevent nonwhite students from having access to the\nmost desirable schools.  Brief for Respondents in No. 05– \n908,  at 19.    Jefferson  County  has  articulated  a  similar \ngoal, phrasing its interest in terms of educating its stu-\ndents “in a racially integrated environment.”  App. in No.\n05–915, at 22.12  Each school district argues that educa-\ntional and broader socialization benefits flow from a ra-\ncially  diverse  learning  environment,  and  each  contends\nthat because the diversity they seek is racial diversity—\nnot the broader diversity at issue in Grutter—it makes \nsense to promote that interest directly by relying on race\nalone. \nThe  parties  and  their  amici  dispute  whether  racial\ndiversity in schools in fact has a marked impact on test \nscores and other objective yardsticks or achieves intangi-\nble socialization benefits.  The debate is not one we need to \n—————— \n12Jefferson County also argues that it would be incongruous to hold\nthat  what  was  constitutionally  required  of  it  one  day—race-based \nassignments pursuant to the desegregation decree—can be constitu-\ntionally prohibited the next.  But what was constitutionally required of \nthe district prior to 2000 was the elimination of the vestiges of prior\nsegregation—not racial proportionality in its own right.  See Freeman \nv. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494–496 (1992).  Once those vestiges were \neliminated, Jefferson County was on the same footing as any other \nschool district, and its use of race must be justified on other grounds. \n\n18  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

J. \n\nresolve, however, because it is clear that the racial classi-\nfications employed by the districts are not narrowly tai-\nlored to the goal of achieving the educational and social \nbenefits asserted to flow from racial diversity.  In design\nand operation, the plans are directed only to racial bal-\nance, pure and simple, an objective this Court has repeat-\nedly condemned as illegitimate. \nThe plans are tied to each district’s specific racial demo-\ngraphics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of the level \nof  diversity  needed  to  obtain  the  asserted  educational\nbenefits.  In Seattle, the district seeks white enrollment of \nbetween  31  and  51  percent  (within  10  percent  of  “the\ndistrict white average” of 41 percent), and nonwhite en-\nrollment of between 49 and 69 percent (within 10 percent \nof “the district minority average” of 59 percent).  App. in \nNo. 05–908, at 103a.  In Jefferson County, by contrast, the \ndistrict seeks black enrollment of no less than 15 or more \nthan 50 percent, a range designed to be “equally above and \nbelow  Black  student  enrollment  systemwide,” \nMcFarland I, 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 842, based on the objec-\ntive of achieving at “all schools . . . an African-American\nenrollment equivalent to the average district-wide Afri-\ncan-American enrollment” of 34 percent.  App. in No. 05–\n915, at 81.  In Seattle, then, the benefits of racial diversity \nrequire enrollment of at least 31 percent white students;\nin Jefferson County, at least 50 percent.  There must be at \nleast  15  percent  nonwhite  students  under  Jefferson\nCounty’s  plan;  in  Seattle,  more  than  three  times  that \nfigure.  This comparison makes clear that the racial demo-\ngraphics in each district—whatever they happen to be—\ndrive the required “diversity” numbers.  The plans here\nare not tailored to achieving a degree of diversity neces-\nsary to realize the asserted educational benefits; instead \nthe plans are tailored, in the words of Seattle’s Manager of\nEnrollment Planning, Technical Support, and Demograph-\nics, to “the goal established by the school board of attain-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  19 \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u Crt. J. \ning a level of diversity within the schools that approxi-\nmates the district’s overall demographics.”  App. in No. \n05–908, at 42a. \nThe districts offer no evidence that the level of racial \ndiversity  necessary  to  achieve  the  asserted  educational \nbenefits happens to coincide with the racial demographics\nof  the  respective  school  districts—or  rather  the \nwhite/nonwhite or black/“other” balance of the districts, \nsince that is the only diversity addressed by the plans. \nIndeed, in its brief Seattle simply assumes that the educa-\ntional benefits track the racial breakdown of the district. \nSee Brief for Respondents in No. 05–908, at 36 (“For Seat-\ntle, ‘racial balance’ is clearly not an end in itself but rather \na measure of the extent to which the educational goals the \nplan was designed to foster are likely to be achieved”).\nWhen  asked  for  “a  range  of  percentage  that  would  be \ndiverse,” however, Seattle’s expert said it was important to\nhave “sufficient numbers so as to avoid students feeling \nany kind of specter of exceptionality.”  App. in No. 05–908, \nat 276a.  The district did not attempt to defend the propo-\nsition that anything outside its range posed the “specter of\nexceptionality.”  Nor did it demonstrate in any way how \nthe educational and social benefits of racial diversity or \navoidance of racial isolation are more likely to be achieved\nat a school that is 50 percent white and 50 percent Asian-\nAmerican, which would qualify as diverse under Seattle’s \nplan, than at a school that is 30 percent Asian-American, \n25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 \npercent white, which under Seattle’s definition would be \nracially concentrated.\n  Similarly,  Jefferson  County’s  expert  referred  to  the\nimportance of having “at least 20 percent” minority group \nrepresentation for the group “to be visible enough to make\na  difference,”  and  noted  that  “small  isolated  minority \ngroups in a school are not likely to have a strong effect on \nthe overall school.”  App. in No. 05–915, at 159, 147.

Joshua  McDonald’s \nrequested transfer was denied because his race was listed\nas “other” rather than black, and allowing the transfer\nwould have had an adverse effect on the racial guideline\ncompliance of Young Elementary, the school he sought to\nleave.  Id., at 21.  At the time, however, Young Elementary\nwas 46.8 percent black.  Id., at 73.  The transfer might\nhave had an adverse effect on the effort to approach dis-\ntrict-wide racial proportionality at Young, but it had noth-\ning to do with preventing either the black or “other” group\nfrom becoming “small” or “isolated” at Young.\nIn fact, in each case the extreme measure of relying on\nrace in assignments is unnecessary to achieve the stated \ngoals, even as defined by the districts.  For example, at\nFranklin High School in Seattle, the racial tiebreaker was \napplied because nonwhite enrollment exceeded 69 percent, \nand resulted in an incoming ninth-grade class in 2000–\n2001 that was 30.3 percent Asian-American, 21.9 percent \nAfrican-American, 6.8 percent Latino, 0.5 percent Native-\nAmerican, and 40.5 percent Caucasian.  Without the racial \ntiebreaker, the class would have been 39.6 percent Asian-\nAmerican,  30.2  percent  African-American,  8.3  percent\nLatino,  1.1  percent  Native-American,  and  20.8  percent \nCaucasian.  See App. in No. 05–908, at 308a.  When the \nactual racial breakdown is considered, enrolling students \nwithout regard to their race yields a substantially diverse \nstudent body under any definition of diversity.13 \n—————— \n13Data for the Seattle schools in the several years since this litigation\nwas commenced further demonstrate the minimal role that the racial \ntiebreaker in fact played.  At Ballard, in 2005–2006—when no class at \nthe school was subject to the racial tiebreaker—the student body was\n14.2 percent Asian-American, 9 percent African-American, 11.7 percent\nLatino,  62.3  percent  Caucasian,  and  2.8  percent  Native-American. \n\nCite as: 551 U.

Id., at 335–336.  Here \nthe racial balance the districts seek is a defined range set\nsolely by reference to the demographics of the respective \nschool districts. \nThis working backward to achieve a particular type of\nracial balance, rather than working forward from some\ndemonstration of the level of diversity that provides the\npurported  benefits,  is  a  fatal  flaw  under  our  existing\nprecedent.

The sweep of the mandate claimed by the\ndistrict  is  contrary  to  our  rulings  that  remedying  past\nsocietal  discrimination  does  not  justify  race-conscious \ngovernment action.

Racial balancing is not \ntransformed from “patently unconstitutional” to a compel-\nling state interest simply by relabeling it “racial diversity.”  \nWhile the school districts use various verbal formulations \nto describe the interest they seek to promote—racial di-\nversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration—\nthey  offer  no  definition  of  the  interest  that  suggests  it \ndiffers from racial balance.  See, e.g., App. in No. 05–908,\nat 257a (“Q. What’s your understanding of when a school \nsuffers from racial isolation? A. I don’t have a definition \nfor that”); id., at 228a–229a (“I don’t think we’ve ever sat \ndown and said, ‘Define racially concentrated school exactly\non point in quantitative terms.’  I don’t think we’ve ever \nhad that conversation”); Tr. in McFarland I, at 1–90 (Dec. \n8, 2003) (“Q. How does the Jefferson County School Board \ndefine  diversity . . . ?”  “A.  Well,  we  want  to  have  the \nschools that make up the percentage of students of the\npopulation”).\nJefferson County phrases its interest as “racial integra-\ntion,” but integration certainly does not require the sort of\nracial proportionality reflected in its plan.  Even in the \ncontext of mandatory desegregation, we have stressed that\nracial  proportionality  is  not  required,  see  Milliken,  433 \nU. S., at 280, n. 14 (“[A desegregation] order contemplat-\ning the substantive constitutional right [to a] particular\ndegree of racial balance or mixing is . . . infirm as a matter\nof  law”  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted));  Swann  v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.

For the \nforegoing reasons, this conclusory argument cannot sus-\ntain the plans.  However closely related race-based as-\nsignments may be to achieving racial balance, that itself \ncannot be the goal, whether labeled “racial diversity” or\nanything else.  To the extent the objective is sufficient \ndiversity so that students see fellow students as individu-\nals rather than solely as members of a racial group, using \nmeans that treat students solely as members of a racial\ngroup is fundamentally at cross-purposes with that end. \nC \nThe districts assert, as they must, that the way in which \nthey  have  employed  individual  racial  classifications  is\nnecessary to achieve their stated ends.  The minimal effect \nthese classifications have on student assignments, how-\never, suggests that other means would be effective.  Seat-\ntle’s racial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a\nsmall number of students between schools.  Approximately\n307 student assignments were affected by the racial tie-\nbreaker in 2000–2001; the district was able to track the \nenrollment status of 293 of these students.  App. in No. \n05–908, at 162a.  Of these, 209 were assigned to a school \nthat was one of their choices, 87 of whom were assigned to \nthe same school to which they would have been assigned \nwithout the racial tiebreaker.  Eighty-four students were\nassigned to schools that they did not list as a choice, but\n29 of those students would have been assigned to their \nrespective school without the racial tiebreaker, and 3 were \n\n26  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

In \nover one-third of the assignments affected by the racial \ntiebreaker, then, the use of race in the end made no differ-\nence, and the district could identify only 52 students who \nwere ultimately affected adversely by the racial tiebreaker\nin that it resulted in assignment to a school they had not \nlisted as a preference and to which they would not other-\nwise have been assigned. \nAs the panel majority in Parents Involved VI concluded: \n“[T]he  tiebreaker’s  annual  effect  is  thus  merely  to\nshuffle a few handfuls of different minority students \nbetween a few schools—about a dozen additional La-\ntinos into Ballard, a dozen black students into Nathan \nHale, perhaps two dozen Asians into Roosevelt, and so \non.  The District has not met its burden of proving\nthese marginal changes . . . outweigh the cost of sub-\njecting hundreds of students to disparate treatment \nbased solely upon the color of their skin.”  377 F. 3d, \nat 984–985 (footnote omitted). \nSimilarly, Jefferson County’s use of racial classifications \nhas only a minimal effect on the assignment of students. \nElementary school students are assigned to their first- or \nsecond-choice school 95 percent of the time, and transfers, \nwhich account for roughly 5 percent of assignments, are \nonly denied 35 percent of the time—and presumably an\neven smaller percentage are denied on the basis of the \nracial guidelines, given that other factors may lead to a \ndenial.  McFarland I, 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 844–845, nn. 16, \n18.  Jefferson County estimates that the racial guidelines \naccount for only 3 percent of assignments.  Brief in Oppo-\nsition in No. 05–915, p. 7, n. 4; Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05–\n915,  at  46.   As  Jefferson  County  explains,  “the  racial\nguidelines have minimal impact in this process, because\nthey ‘mostly influence student assignment in subtle and \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  27 \nOpinion of the Court \nindirect  ways.’”    Brief  for  Respondents  in  No.  05–915,\npp. 8–9.\nWhile we do not suggest that greater use of race would \nbe preferable, the minimal impact of the districts’ racial\nclassifications  on  school  enrollment  casts  doubt  on  the \nnecessity of using racial classifications.  In Grutter, the \nconsideration of race was viewed as indispensable in more\nthan tripling minority representation at the law school—\nfrom 4 to 14.5 percent.  See 539 U. S., at 320.  Here the \nmost Jefferson County itself claims is that “because the \nguidelines provide a firm definition of the Board’s goal of \nracially  integrated  schools,  they  ‘provide  administrators\nwith the authority to facilitate, negotiate and collaborate\nwith principals and staff to maintain schools within the \n15–50% range.’”  Brief in Opposition in No. 05–915, at 7 \n(quoting  McFarland  I,  supra,  at  842).  Classifying  and \nassigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception\nof race is an extreme approach in light of our precedents\nand our Nation’s history of using race in public schools, \nand requires more than such an amorphous end to justify\nit. \nThe districts have also failed to show that they consid-\nered methods other than explicit racial classifications to\nachieve  their  stated  goals.    Narrow  tailoring  requires\n“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral \nalternatives,” Grutter, supra, at 339, and yet in Seattle \nseveral  alternative  assignment  plans—many  of  which\nwould not have used express racial classifications—were\nrejected with little or no consideration.  See, e.g., App. in \nNo. 05–908, at 224a–225a, 253a–259a, 307a.  Jefferson \nCounty has failed to present any evidence that it consid-\nered alternatives, even though the district already claims \nthat its goals are achieved primarily through means other \nthan the racial classifications.

Instead, it selectively relies on inapplicable \nprecedent and even dicta while dismissing contrary hold-\nings,  alters  and  misapplies  our  well-established  legal\nframework  for  assessing  equal  protection  challenges  to\nexpress racial classifications, and greatly exaggerates the \nconsequences of today’s decision. \nTo  begin  with,  JUSTICE  BREYER  seeks  to  justify  the \nplans at issue under our precedents recognizing the com-\npelling interest in remedying past intentional discrimina-\ntion.  See post, at 18–24.  Not even the school districts go \nthis far, and for good reason.  The distinction between \nsegregation by state action and racial imbalance caused by \nother factors has been central to our jurisprudence in this\narea for generations.  See, e.g., Milliken, 433 U. S., at 280, \nn. 14; Freeman, 503 U. S., at 495–496 (“Where resegrega-\ntion is a product not of state action but of private choices,\nit does not have constitutional implications”).  The dissent \nelides this distinction between de jure and de facto segre-\ngation, casually intimates that Seattle’s school attendance \npatterns reflect illegal segregation, post, at 5, 18, 23,15 and \n—————— \n15 JUSTICE BREYER makes much of the fact that in 1978 Seattle “set-\ntled” an NAACP complaint alleging illegal segregation with the federal\nOffice for Civil Rights (OCR).  See post, at 5, 8–9, 18, 23.  The memo-\nrandum of agreement between Seattle and OCR, of course, contains no \nadmission by Seattle that such segregation ever existed or was ongoing \nat the time of the agreement, and simply reflects a “desire to avoid the\nincovenience [sic] and expense of a formal OCR investigation,” which \nOCR was obligated under law to initiate upon the filing of such a \ncomplaint.

J. \nfails to credit the judicial determination—under the most \nrigorous standard—that Jefferson County had eliminated \nthe vestiges of prior segregation.  The dissent thus alters \nin fundamental ways not only the facts presented here but\nthe established law. \nJUSTICE BREYER’s reliance on McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 \nU. S. 39 (1971), post, at 23–24, 29–30, highlights how far\nremoved the discussion in the dissent is from the question \nactually presented in these cases.  McDaniel concerned a \nGeorgia school system that had been segregated by law. \nThere was no doubt that the county had operated a “dual \nschool system,” McDaniel, supra, at 41, and no one ques-\ntions that the obligation to disestablish a school system \nsegregated by law can include race-conscious remedies—\nwhether or not a court had issued an order to that effect. \nSee supra, at 12.  The present cases are before us, how-\never, because the Seattle school district was never segre-\ngated by law, and the Jefferson County district has been \nfound to be unitary, having eliminated the vestiges of its\nprior  dual  status.  The  justification  for  race-conscious \nremedies  in  McDaniel  is  therefore  not  applicable  here. \nThe dissent’s persistent refusal to accept this distinction—\nits insistence on viewing the racial classifications here as\nif they were just like the ones in McDaniel, “devised to \novercome a history of segregated public schools,” post, at \n47—explains its inability to understand why the remedial \njustification for racial classifications cannot decide these \ncases. \nJUSTICE BREYER’s dissent next relies heavily on dicta \nfrom  Swann  v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  Bd.  of  Ed.,  402 \nU. S., at 16—far more heavily than the school districts\nthemselves.  Compare  post, at 3, 22–28, with Brief for \nRespondents in No. 05–908, at 19–20; Brief for Respon-\ndents in No. 05–915, at 31.

J. \n\nthe  two-sentence  discussion  in  Swann  was  pure  dicta, \npost, at 22, but nonetheless asserts that it demonstrates a \n“basic principle of constitutional law” that provides “au-\nthoritative legal guidance.”  Post, at 22, 30.  Initially, as\nthe Court explained just last Term, “we are not bound to\nfollow our dicta in a prior case in which the point now at\nissue  was  not  fully  debated.”    Central  Va.  Community \nCollege v. Katz, 546 U. S. 356, 363 (2006).  That is particu-\nlarly true given that, when Swann was decided, this Court \nhad not yet confirmed that strict scrutiny applies to racial \nclassifications like those before us.  See n. 16, infra.  There \nis nothing “technical” or “theoretical,” post, at 30, about \nour approach to such dicta.  See, e.g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 \nWheat. 264, 399–400 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (explaining \nwhy dicta is not binding).\nJUSTICE BREYER would not only put such extraordinary\nweight on admitted dicta, but relies on the statement for\nsomething it does not remotely say.  Swann addresses only\na possible state objective; it says nothing of the permissi-\nble  means—race  conscious  or  otherwise—that  a  school \ndistrict might employ to achieve that objective.  The rea-\nson for this omission is clear enough, since the case did not\ninvolve any voluntary means adopted by a school district. \nThe  dissent’s  characterization  of  Swann  as  recognizing\nthat  “the  Equal  Protection  Clause  permits  local  school\nboards to use race-conscious criteria to achieve positive\nrace-related goals” is—at best—a dubious inference.  Post, \nat 22.  Even if the dicta from Swann were entitled to the \nweight the dissent would give it, and no dicta is, it not \nonly did not address the question presented in Swann, it \nalso  does  not  address  the  question  presented  in  these\ncases—whether the school districts’ use of racial classifica-\ntions to achieve their stated goals is permissible.    \nFurther, for all the lower court cases JUSTICE BREYER \ncites  as  evidence  of  the  “prevailing  legal  assumption” \nembodied by Swann, very few are pertinent.

But \nTometz addressed a challenge to a statute requiring race-\nconsciousness in drawing school attendance boundaries—\nan issue well beyond the scope of the question presented in \nthese cases.

E. \n2d, at 502 (“The test of any legislative classification essen-\ntially is one of reasonableness”), which even the dissent \ngrudgingly recognizes is an improper standard for evaluat-\ning express racial classifications.  Other cases cited are \nsimilarly inapplicable.  See, e.g., Citizens for Better Ed. v. \nGoose Creek Consol. Independent School Dist., 719 S. W. \n2d  350,  352–353  (Tex.  App.  1986)  (upholding  rezoning\nplan under rational-basis review).16 \n—————— \n16In fact, all the cases JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent cites as evidence of \nthe “prevailing legal assumption,” see post, at 25–27, were decided \nbefore this Court definitively determined that “all racial classifications \n. . .  must  be  analyzed  by  a  reviewing  court  under  strict  scrutiny.” \nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995).  Many\nproceeded under the now-rejected view that classifications seeking to\nbenefit a disadvantaged racial group should be held to a lesser stan-\ndard of review.  See, e.g., Springfield School Comm. v. Barksdale, 348 \nF. 2d 261, 266 (CA1 1965).  Even if this purported distinction, which \nJUSTICE STEVENS would adopt, post, at 2, n. 3 (dissenting opinion), had \nnot been already rejected by this Court, the distinction has no relevance \nto these cases, in which students of all races are excluded from the \nschools they wish to attend based solely on the racial classifications. \nSee, e.g., App. in No. 05–908, at 202a (noting that 89 nonwhite students \nwere denied assignment to a particular school by operation of Seattle’s\nracial tiebreaker). \nJUSTICE STEVENS’s reliance on School Comm. of Boston v.

S. 457, 472, n. 15 (1982), post, at 56–57, but there this \nCourt expressly noted that it was not passing on the pro-\npriety of race-conscious student assignments in the ab-\nsence of a finding of de jure segregation.  Similarly, the\ncitation of Crawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, 458 \nU. S. 527 (1982), post, at 24, in which a state referendum \nprohibiting a race-based assignment plan was challenged,\nis  inapposite—in  Crawford  the  Court  again  expressly \nreserved the question presented by these cases.  458 U. S., \nat 535, n. 11.  Such reservations and preliminary analyses\nof course did not decide the merits of this question—as \nevidenced by the disagreement among the lower courts on \nthis issue.  Compare Eisenberg, 197 F. 3d, at 133, with \nComfort, 418 F. 3d, at 13. \nJUSTICE BREYER’s dissent also asserts that these cases \nare controlled by Grutter, claiming that the existence of a \ncompelling interest in these cases “follows a fortiori” from \nGrutter,  post,  at  41,  64–66,  and  accusing  us  of  tacitly \n—————— \nracial imbalance in schools but did not specify how to achieve this\ngoal—and certainly did not require express racial classifications as the\nmeans to do so.  The law was upheld under rational-basis review, with\nthe state court explicitly rejecting the suggestion—which is now plainly\nthe law—that “racial group classifications bear a far heavier burden of\njustification.”  352 Mass., at 700, 227 N. E. 2d, at 734 (internal quota-\ntion marks and citation omitted).  The passage JUSTICE STEVENS quotes\nproves our point; all the quoted language says is that the school com-\nmittee “shall prepare a plan to eliminate the imbalance.”  Id., at 695, \n227 N. E. 2d, at 731; see post, at 4, n. 5.  Nothing in the opinion ap-\nproves use of racial classifications as the means to address the imbal-\nance.  The suggestion that our decision today is somehow inconsistent\nwith our disposition of that appeal is belied by the fact that neither the\nlower courts, the respondent school districts, nor any of their 51 amici \nsaw fit even to cite the case.  We raise this fact not to argue that the \ndismissal  should  be  afforded  any  different  stare  decisis  effect,  but \nrather simply to suggest that perhaps—for the reasons noted above—\nthe dismissal does not mean what JUSTICE STEVENS believes it does. \n\nCite as: 551 U.

The dissent over-\nreads Grutter, however, in suggesting that it renders pure \nracial  balancing  a  constitutionally  compelling  interest; \nGrutter itself recognized that using race simply to achieve \nracial balance would be “patently unconstitutional,” 539\nU. S., at 330.  The Court was exceedingly careful in de-\nscribing the interest furthered in Grutter as “not an inter-\nest in simple ethnic diversity” but rather a “far broader\narray of qualifications and characteristics” in which race\nwas but a single element.  539 U. S., at 324–325 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  We take the Grutter Court at \nits  word.  We  simply  do  not  understand  how  JUSTICE \nBREYER can maintain that classifying every schoolchild as \nblack or white, and using that classification as a determi-\nnative factor in assigning children to achieve pure racial\nbalance, can be regarded as “less burdensome, and hence \nmore narrowly tailored” than the consideration of race in \nGrutter, post, at 47, when the Court in Grutter stated that \n“[t]he importance of . . . individualized consideration” in\nthe program was “paramount,” and consideration of race\nwas one factor in a “highly individualized, holistic review.” \n539 U. S., at 337.  Certainly if the constitutionality of the\nstark use of race in these cases were as established as the \ndissent would have it, there would have been no need for \nthe extensive analysis undertaken in Grutter.  In light of \nthe foregoing, JUSTICE BREYER’s appeal to stare decisis \nrings particularly hollow.  See post, at 65–66. \nAt the same time it relies on inapplicable desegregation\ncases, misstatements of admitted dicta, and other noncon-\ntrolling pronouncements, JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent can-\ndidly dismisses the significance of this Court’s repeated \nholdings that all racial classifications must be reviewed \nunder strict scrutiny, see post, at 31–33, 35–36, arguing\nthat  a  different  standard  of  review  should  be  applied \nbecause the districts use race for beneficent rather than \nmalicious purposes, see post, at 31–36. \n\n34  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

JUSTICE BREYER nonethe-\nless relies on the good intentions and motives of the school \ndistricts, stating that he has found “no case that . . . repu-\ndiated this constitutional asymmetry between that which\nseeks to exclude and that which seeks to include members \nof minority races.”  Post, at 29 (emphasis in original).  We \nhave found many.  Our cases clearly reject the argument\nthat motives affect the strict scrutiny analysis.

Accepting JUSTICE BREYER’s approach would “do no\nmore than move us from ‘separate but equal’ to ‘unequal \nbut benign.’”  Metro Broadcasting, supra, at 638 (KEN-\nNEDY, J., dissenting).\nJUSTICE BREYER speaks of bringing “the races” together\n(putting aside the purely black-and-white nature of the \nplans), as the justification for excluding individuals on the\nbasis of their race.  See post, at 28–29.  Again, this ap-\nproach to racial classifications is fundamentally at odds \nwith  our  precedent,  which  makes  clear  that  the  Equal\nProtection  Clause  “protect[s] persons,  not  groups,”  Ada-\nrand, 515 U.

See ibid. \n(“[A]ll governmental action based on race—a group classi-\nfication long recognized as ‘in most circumstances irrele-\nvant  and  therefore  prohibited,’  Hirabayashi  [v.

The rights established are personal rights”).\nThis fundamental principle goes back, in this context, to \nBrown itself.  See Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. \n294, 300 (1955) (Brown II) (“At stake is the personal inter-\nest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools . . . on a \nnondiscriminatory  basis”  (emphasis  added)).    For  the \ndissent,  in  contrast,  “‘individualized  scrutiny’  is  simply \nbeside the point.”  Post, at 55. \nJUSTICE  BREYER’s  position  comes  down  to  a  familiar \nclaim: The end justifies the means.  He admits that “there \nis a cost in applying ‘a state-mandated racial label,’” post, \nat 67, but he is confident that the cost is worth paying. \nOur established strict scrutiny test for racial classifica-\ntions, however, insists on “detailed examination, both as to \nends and as to means.”  Adarand, supra, at 236 (emphasis\nadded).  Simply because the school districts may seek a \nworthy goal does not mean they are free to discriminate on\nthe basis of race to achieve it, or that their racial classifi-\ncations should be subject to less exacting scrutiny.    \nDespite his argument that these cases should be evalu-\nated under a “standard of review that is not ‘strict’ in the \ntraditional  sense  of  that  word,”  post,  at  36,  JUSTICE \nBREYER  still  purports  to  apply  strict  scrutiny  to  these \ncases.  See  post,  at  37.    It  is  evident,  however,  that \nJUSTICE  BREYER’s  brand  of  narrow  tailoring  is  quite\nunlike anything found in our precedents.  Without any\ndetailed discussion of the operation of the plans, the stu-\ndents who are affected, or the districts’ failure to consider \nrace-neutral alternatives, the dissent concludes that the \ndistricts have shown that these racial classifications are \nnecessary to achieve the districts’ stated goals.  This con-\nclusion is divorced from any evaluation of the actual im-\npact of the plans at issue in these cases—other than to \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  37 \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u Crt. J. \nnote that the plans “often have no effect.”  Post, at 46.17 \nInstead, the dissent suggests that some combination of the \ndevelopment of these plans over time, the difficulty of the \nendeavor, and the good faith of the districts suffices to \ndemonstrate that these stark and controlling racial classi-\nfications  are  constitutional.  The  Constitution  and  our \nprecedents require more.\nIn keeping with his view that strict scrutiny should not \napply, JUSTICE BREYER repeatedly urges deference to local \nschool boards on these issues.  See, e.g., post, at 21, 48–49, \n66.  Such deference “is fundamentally at odds with our \nequal  protection  jurisprudence.  We  put  the  burden  on\nstate actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies\nare justified.”  Johnson, 543 U. S., at 506, n. 1.  See Cro-\nson, 488 U. S., at 501 (“The history of racial classifications\nin this country suggests that blind judicial deference to\nlegislative or executive pronouncements of necessity has \nno place in equal protection analysis”); West Virginia Bd. \nof Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 637 (1943) (“The Four-\nteenth  Amendment  . . .  protects  the  citizen  against  the \nState itself and all of its creatures—Boards of Education \nnot excepted”).\nJUSTICE BREYER’s dissent ends on an unjustified note of \nalarm.  It predicts that today’s decision “threaten[s]” the \nvalidity of “[h]undreds of state and federal statutes and \nregulations.”  Post, at 61; see also post, at 27–28.  But the \n—————— \n17 JUSTICE BREYER also tries to downplay the impact of the racial as-\nsignments by stating that in Seattle “students can decide voluntarily to \ntransfer to a preferred district high school (without any consideration of \nrace-conscious criteria).”  Post, at 46.  This presumably refers to the\ndistrict’s decision to cease, for 2001–2002 school year assignments, \napplying the racial tiebreaker to students seeking to transfer to a\ndifferent school after ninth grade.  See App. in No. 05–908, at 137a– \n139a.  There are obvious disincentives for students to transfer to a \ndifferent school after a full quarter of their high school experience has \npassed, and the record sheds no light on how transfers to the oversub-\nscribed high schools are handled. \n\n38  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

S. C. \n§6311(b)(2)(C)(v)—have nothing to do with the pertinent \nissues in these cases. \nJUSTICE  BREYER  also  suggests  that  other  means  for\nachieving greater racial diversity in schools are necessar-\nily unconstitutional if the racial classifications at issue in\nthese cases cannot survive strict scrutiny.  Post, at 58–62. \nThese other means—e.g., where to construct new schools, \nhow to allocate resources among schools, and which aca-\ndemic offerings to provide to attract students to certain\nschools—implicate  different  considerations  than  the  ex-\nplicit racial classifications at issue in these cases, and we\nexpress no opinion on their validity—not even in dicta. \nRather, we employ the familiar and well-established ana-\nlytic approach of strict scrutiny to evaluate the plans at\nissue  today,  an  approach  that  in  no  way  warrants  the\ndissent’s cataclysmic concerns.  Under that approach, the\nschool districts have not carried their burden of showing\nthat  the  ends  they  seek  justify  the  particular  extreme\nmeans they have chosen—classifying individual students \non the basis of their race and discriminating among them\non that basis. \n*    *    * \nIf the need for the racial classifications embraced by the\nschool  districts  is  unclear,  even  on  the  districts’  own \nterms, the costs are undeniable.  “[D]istinctions between\ncitizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very\nnature  odious  to  a  free  people  whose  institutions  are\nfounded  upon  the  doctrine  of  equality.”  Adarand,  515 \nU.

Reno, 509 U. S. 630, \n657  (1993),  and  “endorse  race-based  reasoning  and  the \nconception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus con-\ntributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict.” \nMetro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 603 (O’Connor, J., dis-\nsenting).  As the Court explained in Rice v. Cayetano, 528 \nU. S. 495, 517 (2000), “[o]ne of the principal reasons race \nis treated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans \nthe dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry \ninstead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities.” \nAll this is true enough in the contexts in which these\nstatements  were  made—government  contracting,  voting \ndistricts,  allocation  of  broadcast  licenses,  and  electing\nstate officers—but when it comes to using race to assign \nchildren to schools, history will be heard.  In Brown v. \nBoard of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (Brown I), we\nheld  that  segregation  deprived  black  children  of  equal \neducational  opportunities  regardless  of  whether  school\nfacilities and other tangible factors were equal, because \ngovernment  classification  and  separation  on  grounds  of\nrace themselves denoted inferiority.  Id., at 493–494.  It \nwas not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of le-\ngally separating children on the basis of race on which the \nCourt relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954.  See \nid., at 494 (“‘The impact [of segregation] is greater when it\nhas the sanction of the law’”).  The next Term, we accord-\ningly stated that “full compliance” with Brown I required\nschool districts “to achieve a system of determining admis-\nsion to the public schools on a nonracial basis.”  Brown II, \n349 U. S., at 300–301 (emphasis added). \nThe parties and their amici debate which side is more \nfaithful to the heritage of Brown, but the position of the \nplaintiffs in Brown was spelled out in their brief and could \n\n40  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

T. 1953, \np.15 (Summary of Argument).  What do the racial classifi-\ncations at issue here do, if not accord differential treat-\nment on the basis of race?  As counsel who appeared be-\nfore this Court for the plaintiffs in Brown put it: “We have\none fundamental contention which we will seek to develop \nin the course of this argument, and that contention is that \nno  State  has  any  authority  under  the  equal-protection \nclause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  use  race  as  a \nfactor  in  affording  educational  opportunities  among  its\ncitizens.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. in Brown I, p. 7 (Robert L.\nCarter, Dec. 9, 1952).  There is no ambiguity in that state-\nment.  And  it  was  that  position  that  prevailed  in  this \nCourt,  which  emphasized  in  its  remedial  opinion  that\nwhat was “[a]t stake is the personal interest of the plain-\ntiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable \non a nondiscriminatory basis,” and what was required was\n“determining admission to the public schools on a nonra-\ncial basis.”  Brown II, supra, at 300–301 (emphasis added).  \nWhat do the racial classifications do in these cases, if not \ndetermine admission to a public school on a racial basis?\nBefore  Brown,  schoolchildren  were  told  where  they \ncould and could not go to school based on the color of their \nskin.  The school districts in these cases have not carried \nthe heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow \nthis  once  again—even  for  very  different  reasons.  For \nschools that never segregated on the basis of race, such as \nSeattle, or that have removed the vestiges of past segrega-\ntion,  such  as  Jefferson  County,  the  way  “to  achieve  a \nsystem of determining admission to the public schools on a\nnonracial basis,” Brown II, 349 U. S., at 300–301, is to \nstop assigning students on a racial basis.  The way to stop \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  41 \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u Crt.

Contrary to the dissent’s arguments, reseg-\nregation is not occurring in Seattle or Louisville; these\nschool boards have no present interest in remedying past \nsegregation;  and  these  race-based  student-assignment\nprograms  do  not  serve  any  compelling  state  interest. \nAccordingly, the plans are unconstitutional.  Disfavoring a\ncolor-blind interpretation of the Constitution, the dissent \nwould give school boards a free hand to make decisions on\nthe basis of race—an approach reminiscent of that advo-\n\n2  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\n\ncated by the segregationists in Brown v. Board of Educa-\ntion, 347 U. S 483 (1954).  This approach is just as wrong\ntoday as it was a half-century ago.  The Constitution and \nour cases require us to be much more demanding before\npermitting local school boards to make decisions based on \nrace. \nI \nThe dissent repeatedly claims that the school districts\nare  threatened  with  resegregation  and  that  they  will \nsuccumb to that threat if these plans are declared uncon-\nstitutional.  It also argues that these plans can be justified \nas part of the school boards’ attempts to “eradicat[e] ear-\nlier school segregation.”  See, e.g., post, at 4.  Contrary to\nthe dissent’s rhetoric, neither of these school districts is \nthreatened  with  resegregation,  and  neither  is  constitu-\ntionally compelled or permitted to undertake race-based\nremediation.  Racial imbalance is not segregation, and the \nmere incantation of terms like resegregation and remedia-\ntion cannot make up the difference. \nA \nBecause this Court has authorized and required race-\nbased remedial measures to address de jure segregation, it\nis important to define segregation clearly and to distin-\nguish it from racial imbalance.  In the context of public\nschooling,  segregation  is  the  deliberate  operation  of  a \nschool system to “carry out a governmental policy to sepa-\nrate pupils in schools solely on the basis of race.”  Swann \nv. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 6 (1971); \nsee also Monroe v. Board of Comm’rs of Jackson, 391 U. S. \n450, 452 (1968).  In Brown, this Court declared that segre-\ngation was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Swann, supra, at \n6; see also Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391 U. S. \n430,  435  (1968)  (“[T]he  State,  acting  through  the  local \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  3 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nschool board and school officials, organized and operated a\ndual system, part ‘white’ and part ‘Negro.’  It was such \ndual systems that 14 years ago Brown I[, 347 U. S. 483,] \nheld unconstitutional and a year later Brown II[, 349 U. S. \n294 (1955)] held must be abolished”).1 \nRacial  imbalance  is  the  failure  of  a  school  district’s \nindividual  schools  to  match  or  approximate  the  demo-\ngraphic makeup of the student population at large.  Cf. \nWashington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, \n460  (1982).  Racial  imbalance  is  not  segregation.2    Al-\nthough presently observed racial imbalance might result\nfrom past de jure segregation, racial imbalance can also\nresult  from  any  number  of  innocent  private  decisions, \nincluding voluntary housing choices.  See Swann, supra, \nat 25–26; Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 116 (1995) \n(THOMAS, J., concurring).  Because racial imbalance is not \ninevitably linked to unconstitutional segregation, it is not \nunconstitutional in and of itself.  Dayton Bd. of Ed. v. \nBrinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 413 (1977); Dayton Bd. of Ed. v. \nBrinkman, 443 U. S. 526, 531, n. 5 (1979) (“Racial imbal-\nance . . . is not per se a constitutional violation”); Freeman \nv. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494 (1992); see also Swann, supra, \nat 31–32; cf. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, 740–741, \nand n. 19 (1974). \n—————— \n1In this Court’s paradigmatic segregation cases, there was a local \nordinance,  state  statute,  or  state  constitutional  provision  requiring \nracial separation.  See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners in Bolling v. Sharpe, \nO. T. 1952, No. 4, pp. 28–30 (cataloging state laws requiring separa-\ntion  of  the  races);  id.,  at  App.  A  (listing  “Statutory  and  Consti-\ntutional Provisions in the States Where Segregation in Education is\nInstitutionalized”). \n2The  dissent  refers  repeatedly  and  reverently  to  “ ‘integration.’ ”  \nHowever, outside of the context of remediation for past de jure segrega-\ntion, “integration” is simply racial balancing.  See post, at 37.  There-\nfore, the school districts’ attempts to further “integrate” are properly\nthought of as little more than attempts to achieve a particular racial\nbalance. \n\n4  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\n\nAlthough there is arguably a danger of racial imbalance\nin schools in Seattle and Louisville, there is no danger of \nresegregation.  No one contends that Seattle has estab-\nlished or that Louisville has reestablished a dual school \nsystem that separates students on the basis of race.  The \nstatistics cited in Appendix A to the dissent are not to the \ncontrary.  See post, at 69–72.  At most, those statistics \nshow a national trend toward classroom racial imbalance. \nHowever, racial imbalance without intentional state action \nto separate the races does not amount to segregation.  To \nraise  the  specter  of  resegregation  to  defend  these  pro-\ngrams is to ignore the meaning of the word and the nature \nof the cases before us.3 \nB \nJust as the school districts lack an interest in prevent-\ning resegregation, they also have no present interest in\nremedying past segregation.  The Constitution generally\nprohibits government race-based decisionmaking, but this\nCourt has authorized the use of race-based measures for \nremedial purposes in two narrowly defined circumstances. \n—————— \n3The dissent’s assertion that these plans are necessary for the school \ndistricts to maintain their “hard-won gains” reveals its conflation of\nsegregation and racial imbalance.  Post, at 38.  For the dissent’s pur-\nposes, the relevant hard-won gains are the present racial compositions\nin the individual schools in Seattle and Louisville.  However, the actual \nhard-won gain in these cases is the elimination of the vestiges of the \nsystem of state-enforced racial separation that once existed in Louis-\nville.  To equate the achievement of a certain statistical mix in several\nschools with the elimination of the system of systematic de jure segre-\ngation trivializes the latter accomplishment.  Nothing but an interest in\nclassroom aesthetics and a hypersensitivity to elite sensibilities justi-\nfies the school districts’ racial balancing programs.  See Part II–B, \ninfra. But “the principle of inherent equality that underlies and infuses \nour Constitution” required the disestablishment of de jure segregation. \nSee Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995) \n(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Assessed \nin any objective manner, there is no comparison between the two. \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  5 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nFirst, in schools that were formerly segregated by law,\nrace-based measures are sometimes constitutionally com-\npelled  to  remedy  prior  school  segregation.    Second,  in \nCroson, the Court appeared willing to authorize a govern-\nment unit to remedy past discrimination for which it was \nresponsible.  Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, \n504 (1989).  Without explicitly resting on either of these\nstrands  of  doctrine,  the  dissent  repeatedly  invokes  the\nschool  districts’  supposed  interests  in  remedying  past\nsegregation.  Properly analyzed, though, these plans do\nnot fall within either existing category of permissible race-\nbased remediation. \n1 \nThe  Constitution  does  not  permit  race-based  govern-\nment  decisionmaking  simply  because  a  school  district \nclaims a remedial purpose and proceeds in good faith with\narguably  pure  motives.  Grutter  v.  Bollinger,  539  U. S. \n306, 371 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dis-\nsenting in part) (citing Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, \n515 U. S. 200, 239 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part \nand  concurring  in  judgment)).  Rather,  race-based  gov-\nernment decisionmaking is categorically prohibited unless \nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.  Grutter, \nsupra, at 326; see also Part II–A, infra.  This exacting\nscrutiny “has proven automatically fatal” in most cases. \nJenkins, supra, at 121 (THOMAS, J., concurring); cf. Hira-\nbayashi  v.  United  States,  320  U. S.  81,  100  (1943) \n(“[R]acial  discriminations  are  in  most  circumstances  ir-\nrelevant and therefore prohibited”).  And appropriately so.\n“The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not \nonly because those classifications can harm favored races\nor  are  based  on  illegitimate  motives,  but  also  because \nevery time the government places citizens on racial regis-\nters and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens\nor benefits, it demeans us all.”  Grutter, supra, at 353 \n\n6  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\n\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.).  Therefore, as a general rule, all \nrace-based  government  decisionmaking—regardless  of \ncontext—is unconstitutional. \n2 \nThis Court has carved out a narrow exception to that\ngeneral  rule  for  cases  in  which  a  school  district  has  a \n“history  of  maintaining  two  sets  of  schools  in  a  single \nschool system deliberately operated to carry out a govern-\nmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the \nbasis of race.”4  See Swann, 402 U. S., at 5–6.  In such \ncases,  race-based  remedial  measures  are  sometimes  re-\nquired.5  Green, 391 U. S., at 437–438; cf. United States v. \nFordice, 505 U. S. 717, 745 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring).6   But  without  a  history  of  state-enforced  racial \n—————— \n4The dissent makes much of the supposed difficulty of determining \nwhether prior segregation was de jure or de facto. See, e.g., post, at 19– \n20.  That determination typically will not be nearly as difficult as the \ndissent makes it seem.  In most cases, there either will or will not have \nbeen a state constitutional amendment, state statute, local ordinance, \nor local administrative policy explicitly requiring separation of the \nraces.  See, e.g., n. 1, supra.  And even if the determination is difficult, \nit is one the dissent acknowledges must be made to determine what\nremedies school districts are required to adopt. Post, at 43. \n5This Court’s opinion in McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39 (1971), fits \ncomfortably within this framework.  There, a Georgia school board\nvoluntarily adopted a desegregation plan.  At the time of Brown, v. \nBoard  of  Education,  347  U.  S.  483  (1954),  Georgia’s  Constitution\nrequired that “[s]eparate schools shall be provided for the white and \ncolored races.”  Ga. Const., Art. VII, §1, ch. 2–6401 (1948).  Given that \nstate law had previously required the school board to maintain a dual\nschool system, the county was obligated to take measures to remedy its\nprior de jure segregation.  This Court recognized as much in its opinion,\nwhich stated that the school board had an “affirmative duty to disestab-\nlish the dual school system.” McDaniel, supra, at 41. \n6As I have explained elsewhere, the remedies this Court authorized \nlower courts to compel in early desegregation cases like Green and \nSwann were exceptional.  See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 124– \n125 (1995), (THOMAS, J., concurring).  Sustained resistance to Brown \nprompted the Court to authorize extraordinary race-conscious remedial \n\nCite as: 551 U.

Jefferson Cty. Bd. of \nEd., 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 376–377 (WD Ky. 2000), that\ndecree was dissolved in 2000, id., at 360.  Since then, no \nrace-based  remedial  measures  have  been  required  in\nLouisville.  Thus, the race-based student-assignment plan\nat  issue  here,  which  was  instituted  the  year  after  the \ndissolution  of  the  desegregation  decree,  was  not  even\narguably required by the Constitution. \n—————— \nmeasures  (like  compelled  racial  mixing)  to  turn  the  Constitution’s \ndictate to desegregate into reality.  515 U. S., at 125 (THOMAS, J., \nconcurring).  Even if these measures were appropriate as remedies in\nthe face of widespread resistance to Brown’s mandate, they are not\nforever insulated from constitutional scrutiny.  Rather, “such powers \nshould have been temporary and used only to overcome the widespread\nresistance to the dictates of the Constitution.”  515 U. S., at 125 (THO-\nMAS, J., concurring). \n7Though the dissent cites every manner of complaint, record mate-\nrial,  and  scholarly  article  relating  to  Seattle’s  race-based  student \nassignment efforts, post, at 73–75, it cites no law or official policy that\nrequired separation of the races in Seattle’s schools.  Nevertheless, the \ndissent tries to cast doubt on the historical fact that the Seattle schools \nwere never segregated by law by citing allegations that the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People and other organiza-\ntions made in court filings to the effect that Seattle’s schools were once \nsegregated by law.  See post, at 7–9, 23.  These allegations were never\nproved and were not even made in this case.  Indeed, the record before \nus suggests the contrary.  See App. in No. 05–908, pp. 214a, 225a, 257a. \nPast allegations in another case provide no basis for resolving these \ncases. \n\n8  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\n\n3 \nAside  from  constitutionally  compelled  remediation  in\nschools,  this  Court  has  permitted  government  units  to\nremedy prior racial discrimination only in narrow circum-\nstances.  See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, \n277 (1986) (plurality opinion).  Regardless of the constitu-\ntional validity of such remediation, see Croson, supra, at \n524–525 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), it does not \napply here.  Again, neither school board asserts that its\nrace-based actions were taken to remedy prior discrimina-\ntion.  Seattle provides three forward-looking—as opposed \nto remedial—justifications for its race-based assignment \nplan.  Brief for Respondents in No. 05–908, pp. 24–34. \nLouisville  asserts  several  similar  forward-looking  inter-\nests, Brief for Respondents in No. 05–915, pp. 24–29, and \nat  oral  argument,  counsel  for  Louisville  disavowed  any \nclaim that Louisville’s argument “depend[ed] in any way \non the prior de jure segregation,” Tr. of Oral Arg. in No.\n05–915, p. 38.\nFurthermore,  for  a  government  unit  to  remedy  past\ndiscrimination for which it was responsible, the Court has\nrequired it to demonstrate “a ‘strong basis in evidence for \nits conclusion that remedial action was necessary.’”  Cro-\nson,  488  U. S.,  at  500  (quoting  Wygant,  supra,  at  277 \n(plurality opinion)).  Establishing a “strong basis in evi-\ndence” requires proper findings regarding the extent of the\ngovernment unit’s past racial discrimination.  Croson, 488 \nU. S., at 504.  The findings should “define the scope of any\ninjury [and] the necessary remedy,” id., at 505, and must \nbe  more  than  “inherently  unmeasurable  claims  of  past\nwrongs,” id., at 506.  Assertions of general societal dis-\ncrimination  are  plainly  insufficient.    Id.,  at  499,  504; \nWygant, supra, at 274 (plurality opinion); cf. Regents of \nUniv. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 310 (1978) (opinion \nof Powell, J.).  Neither school district has made any such\nspecific  findings.  For  Seattle,  the  dissent  attempts  to \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  9 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nmake up for this failing by adverting to allegations made \nin past complaints filed against the Seattle school district.\nHowever, allegations in complaints cannot substitute for \nspecific findings of prior discrimination—even when those \nallegations lead to settlements with complaining parties. \nCf.  Croson,  supra,  at  505;  Wygant,  supra,  at  279,  n. 5 \n(plurality opinion).  As for Louisville, its slate was cleared \nby  the  District  Court’s  2000  dissolution  decree,  which\neffectively declared that there were no longer any effects\nof de jure discrimination in need of remediation.8 \nDespite the dissent’s repeated intimation of a remedial \npurpose, neither of the programs in question qualifies as a \npermissible  race-based  remedial  measure.    Thus,  the \nprograms are subject to the general rule that government \nrace-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional. \nC \nAs the foregoing demonstrates, racial balancing is some-\ntimes a constitutionally permissible remedy for the dis-\ncrete legal wrong of de jure segregation, and when directed\nto that end, racial balancing is an exception to the general \nrule that government race-based decisionmaking is uncon-\n—————— \n8Contrary to the dissent’s argument, post, at 44, the Louisville school \ndistrict’s interest in remedying its past de jure segregation did vanish \nthe day the District Court found that Louisville had eliminated the\nvestiges of its historic de jure segregation.  See Hampton v. Jefferson \nCty. Bd. of Ed., 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, at 360 (WD Ky. 2000).  If there \nwere further remediation to be done, the District Court could not \nlogically have reached the conclusion that Louisville “ha[d] eliminated\nthe vestiges associated with the former policy of segregation and its\npernicious effects.”  Ibid.  Because Louisville could use race-based \nmeasures only as a remedy for past de jure segregation, it is not “inco-\nherent,” post, at 56, to say that race-based decisionmaking was allowed\nto Louisville one day—while it was still remedying—and forbidden to it\nthe next—when remediation was finished.  That seemingly odd turn-\naround is merely a result of the fact that the remediation of de jure\nsegregation is a jealously guarded exception to the Equal Protection\nClause’s general rule against government race-based decisionmaking. \n\n10  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\n\nstitutional.  Perhaps for this reason, the dissent conflates\nthe concepts of segregation and racial imbalance:  If racial \nimbalance equates to segregation, then it must also be \nconstitutionally  acceptable  to  use  racial  balancing  to \nremedy racial imbalance. \nFor at least two reasons, however, it is wrong to place\nthe remediation of segregation on the same plane as the\nremediation of racial imbalance.  First, as demonstrated \nabove,  the  two  concepts  are  distinct.  Although  racial \nimbalance can result from de jure segregation, it does not\nnecessarily, and the further we get from the era of state-\nsponsored racial separation, the less likely it is that racial\nimbalance has a traceable connection to any prior segrega-\ntion.  See Freeman, 503 U. S., at 496; Jenkins, 515 U. S., \nat 118 (THOMAS, J., concurring). \nSecond, a school cannot “remedy” racial imbalance in \nthe same way that it can remedy segregation.  Remedia-\ntion of past de jure segregation is a one-time process in-\nvolving the redress of a discrete legal injury inflicted by an \nidentified entity.  At some point, the discrete injury will be\nremedied, and the school district will be declared unitary. \nSee Swann, 402 U. S., at 31.  Unlike de jure segregation,\nthere is no ultimate remedy for racial imbalance.  Individ-\nual schools will fall in and out of balance in the natural \ncourse, and the appropriate balance itself will shift with a\nschool  district’s  changing  demographics.  Thus,  racial \nbalancing will have to take place on an indefinite basis—a\ncontinuous process with no identifiable culpable party and \nno discernable end point.  In part for those reasons, the\nCourt has never permitted outright racial balancing solely\nfor the purpose of achieving a particular racial balance. \nII \nLacking a cognizable interest in remediation, neither of \nthese  plans  can  survive  strict  scrutiny  because  neither \nplan serves a genuinely compelling state interest.  The \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  11 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \ndissent  avoids  reaching  that  conclusion  by  unquestion-\ningly accepting the assertions of selected social scientists \nwhile completely ignoring the fact that those assertions\nare the subject of fervent debate.  Ultimately, the dissent’s\nentire analysis is corrupted by the considerations that lead \nit initially to question whether strict scrutiny should apply \nat all.  What emerges is a version of “strict scrutiny” that\ncombines hollow assurances of harmlessness with reflex-\nive acceptance of conventional wisdom.  When it comes to \ngovernment race-based decisionmaking, the Constitution\ndemands more. \nA \nThe dissent claims that “the law requires application\nhere of a standard of review that is not ‘strict’ in the tradi-\ntional sense of that word.”  Post, at 36.  This view is in-\nformed by dissents in our previous cases and the concur-\nrences of two Court of Appeals judges.  Post, at 34–36 \n(citing 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193–1194 (CA9 2005) (Kozinski, \nJ., concurring); Comfort v. Lynn School Comm., 418 F. 3d \n1, 28–29 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring)).  Those \nlower court judges reasoned that programs like these are \nnot “aimed at oppressing blacks” and do not “seek to give\none racial group an edge over another.”  Comfort, supra, at \n27 (Boudin, C. J., concurring); 426 F. 3d, at 1193 (Kozin-\nski, J., concurring).  They were further persuaded that\nthese plans differed from other race-based programs this\nCourt  has  considered  because  they  are  “certainly  more\nbenign than laws that favor or disfavor one race, segregate\nby race, or create quotas for or against a racial group,” \nComfort, 418 F. 3d, at 28 (Boudin, C. J., concurring), and \nthey are “far from the original evils at which the Four-\nteenth Amendment was addressed,” id., at 29; 426 F. 3d, \nat 1195 (Kozinski, J., concurring).  Instead of strict scru-\ntiny, Judge Kozinski would have analyzed the plans under \n“robust and realistic rational basis review.”  Id., at 1194. \n\n12  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\n\nThese arguments are inimical to the Constitution and to \nthis Court’s precedents.9  We have made it unusually clear \nthat strict scrutiny applies to every racial classification. \nAdarand, 515 U. S., at 227; Grutter, 539 U. S., at 326; \nJohnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 505 (2005) (“We have \ninsisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-\ncalled ‘benign’  racial classifications”).10  There are good \nreasons not to apply a lesser standard to these cases.  The \nconstitutional  problems  with  government  race-based \ndecisionmaking are not diminished in the slightest by the\npresence or absence of an intent to oppress any race or by \nthe real or asserted well-meaning motives for the race-\nbased decisionmaking.  Adarand, 515 U. S., at 228–229. \nPurportedly benign race-based decisionmaking suffers the \nsame  constitutional  infirmity  as  invidious  race-based \ndecisionmaking.  Id., at 240 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (“As far as the Constitu-\ntion is concerned, it is irrelevant whether a government’s\nracial  classifications  are  drawn  by  those  who  wish  to\noppress a race or by those who have a sincere desire to \nhelp those thought to be disadvantaged”). \nEven supposing it mattered to the constitutional analy-\nsis, the race-based student assignment programs before us \n—————— \n9The dissent’s appeal to stare decisis, post, at 65, is particularly ironic \nin light of its apparent willingness to depart from these precedents, \npost, at 36–37. \n10The idea that government racial classifications must be subjected\nto strict scrutiny did not originate in Adarand.  As early as Loving v. \nVirginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), this Court made clear that government\naction that “rest[s] solely upon distinctions drawn according to race” \nhad to be “subjected to the ‘most rigid scrutiny.’ ”  Id., at 11 (quoting \nKorematsu  v.  United  States,  323  U. S.  214,  216  (1944));  see  also \nMcLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 196 (1964) (requiring a statute\ndrawing a racial classification to be “necessary, and not merely ration-\nally related, to accomplishment of a permissible state policy”); id., at \n197 (Harlan, J., concurring) (“The necessity test . . . should be equally\napplicable in a case involving state racial discrimination”). \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  13 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nare not as benign as the dissent believes.  See post, at 34– \n35.  “[R]acial  paternalism  and  its  unintended  conse-\nquences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other \nform of discrimination.”  Adarand, supra, at 241 (opinion \nof THOMAS, J.).  As these programs demonstrate, every \ntime  the  government  uses  racial  criteria  to  “bring  the\nraces together,” post, at 29, someone gets excluded, and \nthe person excluded suffers an injury solely because of his \nor her race.  The petitioner in the Louisville case received \na  letter  from  the  school  board  informing  her  that  her \nkindergartener would not be allowed to attend the school \nof petitioner’s choosing because of the child’s race.  App. in\nNo. 05–915, p. 97.  Doubtless, hundreds of letters like this \nwent out from both school boards every year these race-\nbased assignment plans were in operation.  This type of\nexclusion, solely on the basis of race, is precisely the sort \nof government action that pits the races against one an-\nother, exacerbates racial tension, and “provoke[s] resent-\nment  among  those  who  believe  that  they  have  been\nwronged  by  the  government’s  use  of  race.”    Adarand, \nsupra, at 241 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).  Accordingly, these\nplans are simply one more variation on the government \nrace-based decisionmaking we have consistently held must \nbe subjected to strict scrutiny.  Grutter, supra, at 326. \nB \nThough  the  dissent  admits  to  discomfort  in  applying\nstrict scrutiny to these plans, it claims to have nonetheless \napplied that exacting standard.  But in its search for a \ncompelling interest, the dissent casually accepts even the\nmost tenuous interests asserted on behalf of the plans, \ngrouping  them  all  under  the  term  “‘integration.’”    See \npost, at 37.  “‘[I]ntegration,’” we are told, has “three essen-\ntial elements.”  Ibid.  None of these elements is compel-\nling.  And the combination of the three unsubstantiated \nelements does not produce an interest any more compel-\n\n14  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\n\nling than that represented by each element independently. \n1 \nAccording to the dissent, integration involves “an inter-\nest in setting right the consequences of prior conditions of \nsegregation.”  Post,  at  37.    For  the  reasons  explained\nabove, the records in these cases do not demonstrate that \neither school board’s plan is supported by an interest in \nremedying past discrimination.  Part I–B, supra. \nMoreover, the school boards have no interest in remedy-\ning  the  sundry  consequences  of  prior  segregation  unre-\nlated to schooling, such as “housing patterns, employment\npractices, economic conditions, and social attitudes.”  Post, \nat 38.  General claims that past school segregation af-\nfected such varied societal trends are “too amorphous a\nbasis for imposing a racially classified remedy,” Wygant, \n476 U. S., at 276 (plurality opinion), because “[i]t is sheer \nspeculation” how decades-past segregation in the school \nsystem might have affected these trends, see Croson, 488 \nU. S.,  at  499.    Consequently,  school  boards  seeking  to\nremedy those societal problems with race-based measures\nin schools today would have no way to gauge the proper\nscope of the remedy.  Id., at 498.  Indeed, remedial meas-\nures geared toward such broad and unrelated societal ills\nhave “‘no logical stopping point,’” ibid., and threaten to \nbecome “ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless \nin their ability to affect the future,” Wygant, supra, at 276 \n(plurality opinion).  See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 342 (stating \nthe “requirement that all governmental use of race must \nhave a logical end point”). \nBecause the school boards lack any further interest in \nremedying segregation, this element offers no support for \nthe purported interest in “integration.” \n2 \nNext, the dissent argues that the interest in integration \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  15 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nhas  an  educational  element.  The  dissent  asserts  that \nracially  balanced  schools  improve  educational  outcomes \nfor black children.  In support, the dissent unquestioningly \ncites  certain  social  science  research  to  support  proposi-\ntions that are hotly disputed among social scientists.  In \nreality, it is far from apparent that coerced racial mixing \nhas any educational benefits, much less that integration is \nnecessary to black achievement.\nScholars have differing opinions as to whether educa-\ntional benefits arise from racial balancing.  Some have \nconcluded that black students receive genuine educational \nbenefits.  See, e.g., Crain & Mahard, Desegregation and \nBlack Achievement: A Review of the Research, 42 L. & \nContemp. Probs. 17, 48 (1978).  Others have been more \ncircumspect.  See, e.g., Henderson, Greenberg, Schneider,\nUribe,  &  Verdugo,  High  Quality  Schooling  for  African \nAmerican  Students,  in  Beyond  Desegregation  166  (M. \nShujaa ed. 1996) (“Perhaps desegregation does not have a \nsingle  effect,  positive  or  negative,  on  the  academic\nachievement  of  African  American  students,  but  rather \nsome strategies help, some hurt, and still others make no\ndifference whatsoever.  It is clear to us that focusing sim-\nply on demographic issues detracts from focusing on im-\nproving schools”).  And some have concluded that there \nare no demonstrable educational benefits.  See, e.g., Armor \n& Rossell, Desegregation and Resegregation in the Public\nSchools, in Beyond the Color Line: New Perspectives on\nRace and Ethnicity in America 239, 251 (A. Thernstrom & \nS. Thernstrom eds. 2002). \nThe  amicus  briefs  in  the  cases  before  us  mirror  this \ndivergence of opinion.  Supporting the school boards, one \namicus  has  assured  us  that  “both  early  desegregation\nresearch and recent statistical and econometric analyses \n. . .  indicate  that  there  are  positive  effects  on  minority\nstudent  achievement  scores  arising  from  diverse  school \nsettings.”  Brief for American Educational Research Asso-\n\n16  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Another brief claims that \n“school desegregation has a modest positive impact on the\nachievement of African-American students.”  App. to Brief \nfor 553 Social Scientists as Amici Curiae 13–14 (footnote \nomitted).  Yet  neither  of  those  briefs  contains  specific\ndetails like the magnitude of the claimed positive effects \nor the precise demographic mix at which those positive \neffects begin to be realized.  Indeed, the social scientists’ \nbrief rather cautiously claims the existence of any benefit \nat all, describing the “positive impact” as “modest,” id., at \n13, acknowledging that “there appears to be little or no\neffect on math scores,” id., at 14, and admitting that the\n“underlying reasons for these gains in achievement are not \nentirely clear,” id., at 15.11\n  Other amici dispute these findings.  One amicus reports\nthat “[i]n study after study, racial composition of a student \nbody, when isolated, proves to be an insignificant determi-\nnant of student achievement.”  Brief for Dr. John Murphy\net al. as Amici Curiae in No. 05–908, p. 8; see also id., at 9 \n(“[T]here is no evidence that diversity in the K–12 class-\nroom positively affects student achievement”).  Another \namicus  surveys  several  social  science  studies  and  con-\ncludes  that  “a  fair  and  comprehensive  analysis  of  the \n—————— \n11At least one of the academic articles the dissent cites to support\nthis  proposition  fails  to  establish  a  causal  connection  between  the \nsupposed  educational  gains  realized  by  black  students  and  racial\nmixing.  See Hallinan, Diversity Effects on Student Outcomes: Social\nScience Evidence, 59 Ohio St. L. J. 733 (1998).  In the pages following \nthe ones the dissent cites, the author of that article remarks that “the \nmain reason white and minority students perform better academically\nin majority white schools is likely that these schools provide greater\nopportunities to learn.  In other words, it is not desegregation per se\nthat improves achievement, but rather the learning advantages some\ndesegregated schools provide.” Id., at 744.  Evidence that race is a good \nproxy  for  other  factors  that  might  be  correlated  with  educational \nbenefits does not support a compelling interest in the use of race to\nachieve academic results. \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  17 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nresearch shows that there is no clear and consistent evi-\ndence of [educational] benefits.”  Brief for David J. Armor \net al. as Amici Curiae 29. \nAdd to the inconclusive social science the fact of black \nachievement in “racially isolated” environments.  See T. \nSowell,  Education:  Assumptions  Versus  History  7–38 \n(1986).  Before Brown, the most prominent example of an \nexemplary black school was Dunbar High School.  Id., at \n29 (“[I]n the period 1918–1923, Dunbar graduates earned \nfifteen degrees from Ivy League colleges, and ten degrees \nfrom Amherst, Williams, and Wesleyan”).  Dunbar is by no \nmeans an isolated example.  See id., at 10–32 (discussing\nother successful black schools); Walker, Can Institutions \nCare? Evidence from the Segregated Schooling of African \nAmerican Children, in Beyond Desegregation 209–226 (M. \nShujaa ed. 1996); see also T. Sowell, Affirmative Action \nAround the World: An Empirical Study 141–165 (2004).\nEven after Brown, some schools with predominantly black \nenrollments  have  achieved  outstanding  educational  re-\nsults.  See, e.g., S. Carter, No Excuses: Lessons from 21 \nHigh-Performing, High-Poverty Schools 49–50, 53–56, 71–\n73, 81–84, 87–88 (2001); A. Thernstrom & S.

Izumi,  They  Have  Overcome:  High-\nPoverty,  High-Performing  Schools  in  California  (2002) \n(chronicling  exemplary  achievement  in  predominantly \nHispanic schools in California).  There is also evidence \nthat black students attending historically black colleges\nachieve  better  academic  results  than  those  attending \npredominantly white colleges.

That \nschool was founded in 1990 as part of the school board’s\neffort to “increase academic achievement.”12  See African \nAmerican  Academy  History,  online  at  http://www. \nseattleschools.org/schools/aaa/history.htm  (all  Internet \nmaterials as visited June 26, 2007, and available in Clerk \nof Court’s case file).  According to the school’s most recent\nannual  report,  “[a]cademic  excellence”  is  its  “primary\ngoal.”  See African American Academy 2006 Annual Re-\nport,  p. 2,  online  at  http://www.seattleschools.org/area/ \nsiso/reports/anrep/altern/938.pdf.  This  racially  imbal-\nanced  environment  has  reportedly  produced  test  scores\n“higher  across  all  grade  levels  in  reading,  writing  and \nmath.”  Ibid.  Contrary to what the dissent would have \npredicted,  see  post,  at  38–39,  the  children  in  Seattle’s \nAfrican American Academy have shown gains when placed\nin a “highly segregated” environment.\nGiven this tenuous relationship between forced racial\nmixing and improved educational results for black chil-\ndren, the dissent cannot plausibly maintain that an educa-\ntional element supports the integration interest, let alone\nmakes it compelling.13  See Jenkins, 515 U. S., at 121–122 \n—————— \n12Of course, if the Seattle school board were truly committed to the\nnotion that diversity leads directly to educational benefits, operating a\nschool with such a high “nonwhite” enrollment would be a shocking \ndereliction of its duty to educate the students enrolled in that school. \n13In fact, the available data from the Seattle school district appear to\nundercut the dissent’s view.  A comparison of the test results of the \nschools in the last year the racial balancing program operated to the \nresults in the 2004-to-2005 school year (in which student assignments \nwere  race-neutral)  does  not  indicate  the  decline  in  black  achieve- \nment  one  would  expect  to  find  if  black  achievement  were  contin- \ngent  upon  a  particular  racial  mix.

It is not up to the school\nboards—the  very  government  entities  whose  race-based \npractices we must strictly scrutinize—to determine what\ninterests  qualify  as  compelling  under  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.

It defines the “democratic ele-\nment” as “an interest in producing an educational envi-\nronment that reflects the ‘pluralistic society’ in which our\nchildren will live.”  Post, at 39.15  Environmental reflec-\n—————— \n14The dissent accuses me of “feel[ing] confident that, to end invidious\ndiscrimination, one must end all governmental use of race-conscious \ncriteria” and chastises me for not deferring to democratically elected \nmajorities.  See post, at 62.  Regardless of what JUSTICE BREYER’s goals \nmight be, this Court does not sit to “create a society that includes all\nAmericans” or to solve the problems of “troubled inner city schooling.” \nIbid.  We are not social engineers.  The United States Constitution \ndictates that local governments cannot make decisions on the basis of \nrace.  Consequently, regardless of the perceived negative effects of\nracial imbalance, I will not defer to legislative majorities where the\nConstitution forbids it. \nIt should escape no one that behind JUSTICE BREYER’s veil of judicial\nmodesty hides an inflated role for the Federal Judiciary.  The dissent’s \napproach confers on judges the power to say what sorts of discrimina-\ntion are benign and which are invidious. Having made that determina-\ntion (based on no objective measure that I can detect), a judge following\nthe dissent’s approach will set the level of scrutiny to achieve the \ndesired result.  Only then must the judge defer to a democratic major-\nity. In my view, to defer to one’s preferred result is not to defer at all. \n15The notion that a “democratic” interest qualifies as a compelling \ninterest (or constitutes a part of a compelling interest) is proposed for\nthe first time in today’s dissent and has little basis in the Constitution \nor our precedent, which has narrowly restricted the interests that \nqualify as compelling.  See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 351–354 \n(2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The \nFourteenth Amendment does not enact the dissent’s newly minted \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  21 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \ntion, though, is just another way to say racial balancing.\nAnd “[p]referring members of any one group for no reason \nother than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its\nown sake.”  Bakke, 438 U. S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). \n“This the Constitution forbids.”  Ibid.; Grutter, supra, at \n329–330; Freeman, 503 U. S., at 494. \nNavigating  around  that  inconvenient  authority,  the\ndissent argues that the racial balancing in these plans is\nnot an end in itself but is instead intended to “teac[h] \nchildren  to  engage  in  the  kind  of  cooperation  among \nAmericans of all races that is necessary to make a land of \nthree hundred million people one Nation.”  Post, at 39–40. \nThese “generic lessons in socialization and good citizen-\nship” are too sweeping to qualify as compelling interests. \nGrutter, 539 U. S., at 348 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part \nand dissenting in part).  And they are not “uniquely rele-\nvant” to schools or “uniquely ‘teachable’ in a formal educa-\ntional setting.”  Id., at 347.  Therefore, if governments may \nconstitutionally  use  racial  balancing  to  achieve  these \naspirational ends in schools, they may use racial balancing \nto  achieve  similar  goals  at  every  level—from  state-\nsponsored 4–H clubs, see Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. \n385, 388–390 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring), to the state \ncivil service.  See Grutter, 539 U. S. 347–348 (opinion of \nSCALIA, J.).\nMoreover,  the  democratic  interest  has  no  durational \nlimit, contrary to Grutter’s command.  See id., at 342; see \nalso Croson, 488 U. S., at 498; Wygant, 476 U. S., at 275 \n(plurality opinion).  In other words, it will always be im-\nportant for students to learn cooperation among the races.\nIf  this  interest  justifies  race-conscious  measures  today, \nthen logically it will justify race-conscious measures for-\n—————— \n\nunderstanding of liberty.  See Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 75\n\n(1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting) (“The Fourteenth Amendment does not \n\nenact Mr. Herbert Spencer’s Social Statics”). \n\n\n22  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Thus, the democratic interest, limitless in scope and\n“timeless in [its] ability to affect the future,” id., at 276 \n(plurality opinion), cannot justify government race-based \ndecisionmaking.16 \nIn addition to these defects, the democratic element of \nthe integration interest fails on the dissent’s own terms.\nThe dissent again relies upon social science research to \nsupport the proposition that state-compelled racial mixing \nteaches children to accept cooperation and improves racial \nattitudes  and  race  relations.    Here  again,  though,  the \ndissent overstates the data that supposedly support the \ninterest. \nThe dissent points to data that indicate that “black and\nwhite students in desegregated schools are less racially\nprejudiced than those in segregated schools.”  Post, at 40 \n(internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    By  the  dissent’s\naccount,  improvements  in  racial  attitudes  depend  upon \nthe increased contact between black and white students \nthought to occur in more racially balanced schools.  There \nis no guarantee, however, that students of different races\nin the same school will actually spend time with one an-\nother.  Schools  frequently  group  students  by  academic \n—————— \n16The dissent does not explain how its recognition of an interest in \nteaching racial understanding and cooperation here is consistent with \nthe Court’s rejection of a similar interest in Wygant.  In Wygant, a \nschool district justified its race-based teacher-layoff program in part on\nthe theory that “minority teachers provided ‘role models’ for minority \nstudents and that a racially ‘diverse’ faculty would improve the educa-\ntion of all students.”  Grutter, supra, at 352 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)\n(citing Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1984, No. 84–1340, pp. 27–28; 476\nU. S., at 315 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)).  The Court rejected the inter-\nests asserted to justify the layoff program as insufficiently compelling. \nWygant, 476 U. S., at 275–276 (plurality opinion); id., at 295 (White, J., \nconcurring in judgment).  If a school district has an interest in teaching\nracial understanding and cooperation, there is no logical reason why\nthat interest should not extend to the composition of the teaching staff \nas well as the composition of the student body.  The dissent’s reliance \non this interest is, therefore, inconsistent with Wygant. \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  23 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nability as an aid to efficient instruction, but such group-\nings often result in classrooms with high concentrations of\none race or another.  See, e.g., Yonezawa, Wells, & Serna, \nChoosing  Tracks:  “Freedom  of  Choice”  in  Detracting\nSchools,  39  Am.  Ed.  Research  J.,  No.  1,  p. 38  (Spring \n2002); Mickelson, Subverting Swann: First- and Second-\nGeneration  Segregation  in  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nSchools,  38  Am.  Ed.  Research  J.,  No.  2,  pp.  233–234\n(Summer 2001) (describing this effect in schools in Char-\nlotte, North Carolina).  In addition to classroom separa-\ntion, students of different races within the same school \nmay separate themselves socially.  See Hallinan & Wil-\nliams,  Interracial  Friendship  Choices  in  Secondary\nSchools, 54 Am. Sociological Rev., No. 1, pp. 72–76 (Feb. \n1989);  see  also  Clotfelter,  Interracial  Contact  in  High\nSchool Extracurricular Activities, 34 Urban Rev., No. 1, \npp. 41–43 (Mar. 2002).  Therefore, even supposing interra-\ncial contact leads directly to improvements in racial atti-\ntudes and race relations, a program that assigns students\nof different races to the same schools might not capture\nthose benefits.  Simply putting students together under\nthe same roof does not necessarily mean that the students\nwill learn together or even interact.\nFurthermore, it is unclear whether increased interracial \ncontact  improves  racial  attitudes  and  relations.17    One  \n—————— \n17Outside the school context, this Court’s cases reflect the fact that \nracial mixing does not always lead to harmony and understanding.  In \nJohnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499 (2005), this Court considered a \nCalifornia prison policy that separated inmates racially.  Id., at 525– \n528 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).  That policy was necessary because of\n“numerous incidents of racial violence.”  Id., at 502; id., at 532–534 \n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).  As a result of this Court’s insistence on strict \nscrutiny of that policy, but see id., at 538–547, inmates in the Califor-\nnia prisons were killed.  See Beard v. Banks, 548 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) \n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that two were killed and \nhundreds  were  injured  in  race  rioting  subsequent  to  this  Court’s \ndecision in Johnson). \n\n24  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

[;] virtually all of the reviewers determined that\nfew, if any, firm conclusions about the impact of desegre-\ngation on intergroup relations could be drawn.”  Schofield, \nSchool Desegregation and Intergroup Relations: A Review \nof the Literature, in 17 Review of Research in Education \n356 (G. Grant ed. 1991).  Some studies have even found \nthat  a  deterioration  in  racial  attitudes  seems  to  result \nfrom racial mixing in schools.  See N. St. John, School \nDesegregation  Outcomes  for  Children  67–68  (1975)  (“A \nglance at [the data] shows that for either race positive\nfindings  are  less  common  than  negative  findings”);\nStephan, The Effects of School Desegregation: An Evalua-\ntion 30 Years After Brown, in Advances in Applied Social\nPsychology  183–186  (M.  Saks  &  L.  Saxe  eds.  1986). \nTherefore,  it  is  not  nearly  as  apparent  as  the  dissent \nsuggests that increased interracial exposure automatically \nleads to improved racial attitudes or race relations. \nGiven our case law and the paucity of evidence support-\ning  the  dissent’s  belief  that  these  plans  improve  race \nrelations, no democratic element can support the integra-\ntion interest.18 \n4 \nThe dissent attempts to buttress the integration interest\nby claiming that it follows a fortiori from the interest this \n—————— \n18After discussing the “democratic element,” the dissent repeats its \nassertion that the social science evidence supporting that interest is\n“sufficiently strong to permit a school board to determine . . . that this \ninterest is compelling.”  Post, at 40.  Again, though, the school boards\nhave no say in deciding whether an interest is compelling.  Strict \nscrutiny of race-based government decisionmaking is more searching\nthan  Chevron-style  administrative  review  for  reasonableness.    See \nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 \nU. S. 837, 845 (1984). \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  25 \nTHOMAS, J., concurring \nCourt recognized as compelling in Grutter.  Post, at 41. \nRegardless of the merit of Grutter, the compelling interest \nrecognized in that case cannot support these plans.  Grut-\nter recognized a compelling interest in a law school’s at-\ntainment of a diverse student body.  539 U. S., at 328. \nThis  interest  was  critically  dependent  upon  features\nunique to higher education: “the expansive freedoms of \nspeech and thought associated with the university envi-\nronment,” the “special niche in our constitutional tradi-\ntion”  occupied  by  universities,  and  “[t]he  freedom  of  a \nuniversity to make its own judgments as to education[,] \ninclud[ing] the selection of its student body.”  Id., at 329 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  None of these fea-\ntures  is  present  in  elementary  and  secondary  schools.\nThose schools do not select their own students, and educa-\ntion in the elementary and secondary environment gener-\nally does not involve the free interchange of ideas thought \nto be an integral part of higher education.  See 426 F. 3d, \nat 1208 (Bea, J., dissenting).  Extending Grutter to this \ncontext would require us to cut that holding loose from its \ntheoretical  moorings.  Thus,  only  by  ignoring  Grutter’s \nreasoning can the dissent claim that recognizing a compel-\nling interest in these cases is an a fortiori application of \nGrutter. \nC \nStripped of the baseless and novel interests the dissent \nasserts on their behalf, the school boards cannot plausibly\nmaintain that their plans further a compelling interest.\nAs I explained in Grutter, only “those measures the State\nmust take to provide a bulwark against anarchy . . . or to\nprevent  violence”  and  “a  government’s  effort  to  remedy\npast discrimination for which it is responsible” constitute \ncompelling interests.  539 U.

See Part I–B, supra. \nAccordingly, the school boards cannot satisfy strict scru-\ntiny.  These plans are unconstitutional. \nIII \nMost of the dissent’s criticisms of today’s result can be\ntraced to its rejection of the color-blind Constitution.  See \npost, at 29.  The dissent attempts to marginalize the no-\ntion of a color-blind Constitution by consigning it to me\nand Members of today’s plurality.19  See ibid.; see also \npost, at 61.

See, e.g., Part I–B, supra.  Race-based \ngovernment measures during the 1860’s and 1870’s to remedy state-\nenforced slavery were therefore not inconsistent with the color-blind \nConstitution. \n\nCite as: 551 U.

But the solutions mandated by these school \ndistricts must themselves be lawful.

NO. 1\n\nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\nlabels proclaiming the race of all persons in a broad class\nof citizens—elementary school students in one case, high \nschool students in another—are unconstitutional as the \ncases now come to us. \nI agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that we have jurisdic-\ntion to decide the cases before us and join Parts I and II of \nthe Court’s opinion.  I also join Parts III–A and III–C for \nreasons provided below.  My views do not allow me to join \nthe balance of the opinion by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, which \nseems to me to be inconsistent in both its approach and its\nimplications with the history, meaning, and reach of the\nEqual  Protection  Clause.  JUSTICE  BREYER’s  dissenting \nopinion, on the other hand, rests on what in my respectful \nsubmission is a misuse and mistaken interpretation of our \nprecedents.  This leads it to advance propositions that, in \nmy view, are both erroneous and in fundamental conflict \nwith basic equal protection principles.  As a consequence,\nthis separate opinion is necessary to set forth my conclu-\nsions in the two cases before the Court. \nI \nThe opinion of the Court and JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent-\ning  opinion  (hereinafter  dissent)  describe  in  detail  the\nhistory  of  integration  efforts  in  Louisville  and  Seattle. \nThese plans classify individuals by race and allocate bene-\nfits and burdens on that basis; and as a result, they are to\nbe subjected to strict scrutiny.  See Johnson v. California, \n543 U. S. 499, 505–506 (2005); ante, at 11.  The dissent \nfinds that the school districts have identified a compelling \ninterest in increasing diversity, including for the purpose \nof avoiding racial isolation.  See post, at 37–45.  The plu-\nrality, by contrast, does not acknowledge that the school \ndistricts have identified a compelling interest here.  See \nante, at 17–25.  For this reason, among others, I do not\njoin Parts III–B and IV.  Diversity, depending on its mean-\ning  and  definition,  is  a  compelling  educational  goal  a \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  3 \nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \nschool district may pursue.   \nIt is well established that when a governmental policy is \nsubjected  to  strict  scrutiny,  “the  government  has  the\nburden of proving that racial classifications ‘are narrowly\ntailored measures that further compelling governmental \ninterests.’”    Johnson,  supra,  at  505  (quoting  Adarand \nConstructors,  Inc.  v.  Peña,  515  U. S.  200,  227  (1995)). \n“Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for \nsuch race-based measures, there is simply no way of de-\ntermining  what  classifications  are  ‘benign’  or  ‘remedial’ \nand what classifications are in fact motivated by illegiti-\nmate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.” \nRichmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493 (1989) \n(plurality opinion).  And the inquiry into less restrictive \nalternatives demanded by the narrow tailoring analysis\nrequires in many cases a thorough understanding of how a\nplan works.  The government bears the burden of justify-\ning its use of individual racial classifications.  As part of\nthat  burden  it  must  establish,  in  detail,  how  decisions \nbased on an individual student’s race are made in a chal-\nlenged  governmental  program.  The  Jefferson  County\nBoard of Education fails to meet this threshold mandate. \nPetitioner  Crystal  Meredith  challenges  the  district’s\ndecision to deny her son Joshua McDonald a requested \ntransfer  for  his  kindergarten  enrollment.    The  district \nconcedes  it  denied  his  request  “under  the  guidelines,” \nwhich is to say, on the basis of Joshua’s race.  Brief for \nRespondents in No. 05–915, p. 10; see also App. in No. 05–\n915, p. 97.  Yet the district also maintains that the guide-\nlines do not apply to “kindergartens,” Brief for Respon-\ndents in No. 05–915, at 4, and it fails to explain the dis-\ncrepancy.    Resort  to  the  record,  including  the  parties’ \nStipulation  of  Facts,  further  confuses  the  matter.

See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in\nNo. 05–915, at 4–10.

Compare,  e.g.,  App.  in  No.  05–915,  at  37\n(“Each  [Jefferson  County]  school  . . .  has  a  designated \ngeographic attendance area, which is called the ‘resides \narea’ of the school[, and each] such school is the ‘resides \nschool’  for  those  students  whose  parent’s  or  guardian’s \nresidence address is within the school’s geographic atten-\ndance area”); id., at 82 (“All elementary students . . . shall \nbe assigned to the school which serves the area in which \nthey reside”); and Brief for Respondents in No. 05–915, at \n5 (“There are no selection criteria for admission to [an \nelementary  school  student’s]  resides  school,  except  at-\ntainment  of  the  appropriate  age  and  completion  of  the\nprevious grade”), with App. in No. 05–915, at 38 (“Deci-\nsions to assign students to schools within each cluster are \nbased on available space within the [elementary] schools \nand the racial guidelines in the District’s current student \nassignment plan”); id., at 82 (acknowledging that a stu-\ndent may not be assigned to his or her resides school if it\n“has reached . . . the extremes of the racial guidelines”).\nOne can attempt to identify a construction of Jefferson \nCounty’s student assignment plan that, at least as a logi-\ncal matter, complies with these competing propositions;\nbut this does not remedy the underlying problem.  Jeffer-\nson County fails to make clear to this Court—even in the\nlimited respects implicated by Joshua’s initial assignment \nand  transfer  denial—whether  in  fact  it  relies  on  racial \nclassifications in a manner narrowly tailored to the inter-\nest in question, rather than in the far-reaching, inconsis-\ntent, and ad hoc manner that a less forgiving reading of\nthe record would suggest.

See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in\nNo. 05–908, p. 5–11.  The district, nevertheless, has failed \nto make an adequate showing in at least one respect.  It \nhas failed to explain why, in a district composed of a di-\nversity of races, with fewer than half of the students clas-\nsified as “white,” it has employed the crude racial catego-\nries  of  “white”  and  “non-white”  as  the  basis  for  its \nassignment decisions.  See, e.g., id., at 1–11. \nThe district has identified its purposes as follows: “(1) to\npromote the educational benefits of diverse school enroll-\nments;  (2)  to  reduce  the  potentially  harmful  effects  of\nracial isolation by allowing students the opportunity to opt\nout of racially isolated schools; and (3) to make sure that\nracially segregated housing patterns did not prevent non-\nwhite students from having equitable access to the most \npopular  over-subscribed  schools.”    Id.,  at  19.  Yet  the \nschool district does not explain how, in the context of its \ndiverse  student  population,  a  blunt  distinction  between \n“white”  and  “non-white”  furthers  these  goals.    As  the \nCourt explains, “a school with 50 percent Asian-American\nstudents and 50 percent white students but no African-\nAmerican,  Native-American,  or  Latino  students  would \nqualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent Asian-\nAmerican, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent La-\ntino, and 20 percent white students would not.”  Ante, at \n15–16; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae \nin No. 05–908, pp. 13–14.

S. ____ (2007)  7 \nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \nsystem it has chosen, despite what appears to be its ill fit, \nSeattle has not shown its plan to be narrowly tailored\nto achieve its own ends; and thus it fails to pass strict \nscrutiny. \nII \nOur Nation from the inception has sought to preserve \nand expand the promise of liberty and equality on which it \nwas founded.  Today we enjoy a society that is remarkable \nin its openness and opportunity.  Yet our tradition is to go\nbeyond present achievements, however significant, and to \nrecognize and confront the flaws and injustices that re-\nmain.  This is especially true when we seek assurance that \nopportunity is not denied on account of race.  The endur-\ning hope is that race should not matter; the reality is that\ntoo often it does. \nThis is by way of preface to my respectful submission \nthat parts of the opinion by THE CHIEF JUSTICE imply an\nall-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in\ninstances when, in my view, it may be taken into account. \nThe plurality opinion is too dismissive of the legitimate \ninterest government has in ensuring all people have equal \nopportunity regardless of their race.  The plurality’s postu-\nlate that “[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of\nrace is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” ante, at \n40–41, is not sufficient to decide these cases.  Fifty years \nof experience since Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. \n483 (1954), should teach us that the problem before us\ndefies so easy a solution.  School districts can seek to reach \nBrown’s objective of equal educational opportunity.  The \nplurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that\nthe  Constitution  requires  school  districts  to  ignore  the \nproblem of de facto resegregation in schooling.  I cannot \nendorse that conclusion.  To the extent the plurality opin-\nion  suggests  the  Constitution  mandates  that  state  and \nlocal  school  authorities  must  accept  the  status  quo  of \n\n8  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\nracial isolation in schools, it is, in my view, profoundly \nmistaken. \nThe statement by Justice Harlan that “[o]ur Constitu-\ntion  is  color-blind”  was  most  certainly  justified  in  the \ncontext of his dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, \n559 (1896).  The Court’s decision in that case was a griev-\nous error it took far too long to overrule.  Plessy, of course, \nconcerned official classification by race applicable to all\npersons who sought to use railway carriages.  And, as an \naspiration,  Justice  Harlan’s  axiom  must  command  our \nassent.  In the real world, it is regrettable to say, it cannot \nbe a universal constitutional principle.\nIn the administration of public schools by the state and\nlocal authorities it is permissible to consider the racial\nmakeup of schools and to adopt general policies to encour-\nage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial\ncomposition.  Cf. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003); \nid., at 387–388 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).  If school au-\nthorities are concerned that the student-body compositions\nof certain schools interfere with the objective of offering an \nequal educational opportunity to all of their students, they\nare free to devise race-conscious measures to address the \nproblem in a general way and without treating each stu-\ndent in different fashion solely on the basis of a system-\natic, individual typing by race. \nSchool boards may pursue the goal of bringing together \nstudents of diverse backgrounds and races through other \nmeans, including strategic site selection of new schools;\ndrawing attendance zones with general recognition of the\ndemographics  of  neighborhoods;  allocating  resources  for\nspecial  programs;  recruiting  students  and  faculty  in  a \ntargeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, \nand other statistics by race.  These mechanisms are race \nconscious but do not lead to different treatment based on a \nclassification that tells each student he or she is to be \ndefined by race, so it is unlikely any of them would de-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  9 \nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \nmand strict scrutiny to be found permissible.  See Bush v. \nVera, 517 U. S. 952, 958 (1996) (plurality opinion) (“Strict \nscrutiny  does  not  apply  merely  because  redistricting  is \nperformed with consciousness of race. . . . Electoral district\nlines are ‘facially race neutral’ so a more searching inquiry \nis necessary before strict scrutiny can be found applicable \nin redistricting cases than in cases of ‘classifications based\nexplicitly on race’” (quoting Adarand, 515 U. S., at 213)).\nExecutive and legislative branches, which for generations \nnow  have  considered  these  types  of  policies  and  proce-\ndures, should be permitted to employ them with candor\nand with confidence that a constitutional violation does \nnot occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the impact\na  given  approach  might  have  on  students  of  different \nraces.  Assigning to each student a personal designation \naccording to a crude system of individual racial classifica-\ntions is quite a different matter; and the legal analysis \nchanges accordingly.\nEach  respondent  has  asserted  that  its  assignment  of\nindividual students by race is permissible because there is \nno other way to avoid racial isolation in the school dis-\ntricts.  Yet, as explained, each has failed to provide the \nsupport necessary for that proposition.  Cf. Croson, 488 \nU. S., at 501 (“The history of racial classifications in this \ncountry suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative \nor executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in \nequal protection analysis”).  And individual racial classifi-\ncations employed in this manner may be considered le-\ngitimate only if they are a last resort to achieve a compel-\nling interest.  See id., at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in \npart and concurring in judgment). \nIn the cases before us it is noteworthy that the number \nof students whose assignment depends on express racial \nclassifications is limited.  I join Part III–C of the Court’s\nopinion because I agree that in the context of these plans, \nthe small number of assignments affected suggests that \n\n10  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\nthe schools could have achieved their stated ends through \ndifferent means.  These include the facially race-neutral \nmeans set forth above or, if necessary, a more nuanced, \nindividual evaluation of school needs and student charac-\nteristics that might include race as a component.  The \nlatter approach would be informed by Grutter, though of\ncourse the criteria relevant to student placement would \ndiffer based on the age of the students, the needs of the \nparents, and the role of the schools. \nIII \nThe dissent rests on the assumptions that these sweep-\ning race-based classifications of persons are permitted by\nexisting precedents; that its confident endorsement of race\ncategories for each child in a large segment of the commu-\nnity presents no danger to individual freedom in other,\nprospective realms of governmental regulation; and that\nthe racial classifications used here cause no hurt or anger\nof the type the Constitution prevents.  Each of these prem-\nises is, in my respectful view, incorrect. \nA \nThe  dissent’s  reliance  on  this  Court’s  precedents  to\njustify the explicit, sweeping, classwide racial classifica-\ntions at issue here is a misreading of our authorities that, \nit appears to me, tends to undermine well-accepted princi-\nples needed to guard our freedom.  And in his critique of\nthat analysis, I am in many respects in agreement with\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.  The conclusions he has set forth in \nPart III–A of the Court’s opinion are correct, in my view,\nbecause the compelling interests implicated in the cases\nbefore us are distinct from the interests the Court has \nrecognized  in  remedying  the  effects  of  past  intentional \ndiscrimination and in increasing diversity in higher edu-\ncation.  See ante, at 12–13.  As the Court notes, we recog-\nnized the compelling nature of the interest in remedying \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  11 \nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \npast intentional discrimination in Freeman v. Pitts, 503 \nU. S. 467, 494 (1992), and of the interest in diversity in\nhigher  education  in  Grutter.  At  the  same  time,  these \ncompelling interests, in my view, do help inform the pre-\nsent inquiry.  And to the extent the plurality opinion can \nbe interpreted to foreclose consideration of these interests, \nI disagree with that reasoning.   \nAs to the dissent, the general conclusions upon which it\nrelies have no principled limit and would result in the\nbroad acceptance of governmental racial classifications in \nareas far afield from schooling.  The dissent’s permissive\nstrict scrutiny (which bears more than a passing resem-\nblance to rational-basis review) could invite widespread\ngovernmental deployment of racial classifications.  There \nis every reason to think that, if the dissent’s rationale\nwere accepted, Congress, assuming an otherwise proper\nexercise  of  its  spending  authority  or  commerce  power, \ncould mandate either the Seattle or the Jefferson County \nplans nationwide.  There seems to be no principled rule, \nmoreover, to limit the dissent’s rationale to the context of \npublic schools.  The dissent emphasizes local control, see \npost, at 48–49, the unique history of school desegregation, \nsee post, at 2, and the fact that these plans make less use\nof race than prior plans, see post, at 57, but these factors \nseem more rhetorical than integral to the analytical struc-\nture of the opinion.\nThis brings us to the dissent’s reliance on the Court’s\nopinions in Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244 (2003), and \nGrutter, 539 U. S. 306.  If today’s dissent said it was ad-\nhering to the views expressed in the separate opinions in \nGratz and Grutter, see Gratz, 539 U. S., at 281 (BREYER, \nJ., concurring in judgment); id., at 282 (STEVENS, J., dis-\nsenting); id., at 291 (SOUTER, J., dissenting); id., at 298 \n(GINSBURG,  J.,  dissenting);  Grutter,  supra,  at  344 \n(GINSBURG, J., concurring), that would be understandable, \nand likely within the tradition—to be invoked, in my view, \n\n12  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\nin rare instances—that permits us to maintain our own \npositions in the face of stare decisis when fundamental \npoints of doctrine are at stake.  See, e.g., Federal Maritime \nComm’n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, \n770 (2002) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  To say, however,\nthat we must ratify the racial classifications here at issue \nbased on the majority opinions in Gratz and Grutter is, \nwith all respect, simply baffling. \nGratz involved a system where race was not the entire\nclassification.  The procedures in Gratz placed much less\nreliance on race than do the plans at issue here.  The issue \nin Gratz arose, moreover, in the context of college admis-\nsions  where  students  had  other  choices  and  precedent \nsupported the proposition that First Amendment interests \ngive universities particular latitude in defining diversity.\nSee Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 312– \n314 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).  Even so the race factor \nwas found to be invalid.  Gratz, supra, at 251.  If Gratz is \nto be the measure, the racial classification systems here \nare a fortiori invalid.  If the dissent were to say that col-\nlege cases are simply not applicable to public school sys-\ntems  in  kindergarten  through  high  school,  this  would\nseem to me wrong, but at least an arguable distinction. \nUnder no fair reading, though, can the majority opinion in \nGratz be cited as authority to sustain the racial classifica-\ntions under consideration here. \nThe same must be said for the controlling opinion in \nGrutter.  There  the  Court  sustained  a  system  that,  it \nfound, was flexible enough to take into account “all perti-\nnent  elements  of  diversity,”  539  U. S.,  at  341  (internal \nquotation marks omitted), and considered race as only one \nfactor among many, id., at 340.  Seattle’s plan, by con-\ntrast, relies upon a mechanical formula that has denied \nhundreds of students their preferred schools on the basis\nof three rigid criteria: placement of siblings, distance from \nschools, and race.  If those students were considered for a \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  13 \nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \nwhole range of their talents and school needs with race as\njust one consideration, Grutter would have some applica-\ntion.  That, though, is not the case.  The only support\ntoday’s dissent can draw from Grutter must be found in its \nvarious separate opinions, not in the opinion filed for the \nCourt. \nB \nTo uphold these programs the Court is asked to brush\naside two concepts of central importance for determining\nthe validity of laws and decrees designed to alleviate the\nhurt and adverse consequences resulting from race dis-\ncrimination.  The first is the difference between de jure \nand  de  facto  segregation;  the  second,  the  presumptive\ninvalidity of a State’s use of racial classifications to differ-\nentiate its treatment of individuals. \nIn  the  immediate  aftermath  of  Brown  the  Court  ad-\ndressed other instances where laws and practices enforced \nde jure segregation.  See, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. \n1 (1967) (marriage); New Orleans City Park Improvement \nAssn. v. Detiege, 358 U. S. 54 (1958) (per curiam) (public \nparks); Gayle v. Browder, 352 U. S. 903 (1956) (per cu-\nriam) (buses); Holmes v. Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955) (per \ncuriam) (golf courses); Mayor of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350 \nU. S. 877 (1955) (per curiam) (beaches).  But with refer-\nence to schools, the effect of the legal wrong proved most \ndifficult to correct.  To remedy the wrong, school districts \nthat had been segregated by law had no choice, whether \nunder court supervision or pursuant to voluntary desegre-\ngation  efforts,  but  to  resort  to  extraordinary  measures \nincluding individual student and teacher assignment to \nschools  based  on  race.    See,  e.g.,  Swann  v.  Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 8–10 (1971); see also \nCroson, 488 U. S., at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part \nand concurring in judgment) (noting that racial classifica-\ntions “may be the only adequate remedy after a judicial \n\n14  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\ndetermination  that  a  State  or  its  instrumentality  has\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause”).  So it was, as the \ndissent observes, see post, at 13–14, that Louisville classi-\nfied children by race in its school assignment and busing \nplan in the 1970’s. \nOur cases recognized a fundamental difference between\nthose school districts that had engaged in de jure segrega-\ntion and those whose segregation was the result of other \nfactors.  School districts that had engaged in de jure seg-\nregation had an affirmative constitutional duty to deseg-\nregate; those that were de facto segregated did not.  Com-\npare Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391 U. S. 430, \n437–438 (1968), with Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, \n745 (1974).  The distinctions between de jure and de facto \nsegregation extended to the remedies available to govern-\nmental units in addition to the courts.  For example, in \nWygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 274 (1986), \nthe plurality noted: “This Court never has held that socie-\ntal  discrimination  alone  is  sufficient  to  justify  a  racial \nclassification.  Rather, the Court has insisted upon some \nshowing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit\ninvolved before allowing limited use of racial classifica-\ntions in order to remedy such discrimination.”  The Court’s \ndecision  in  Croson,  supra,  reinforced  the  difference  be-\ntween the remedies available to redress de facto and de \njure discrimination: \n“To accept [a] claim that past societal discrimination \nalone can serve as the basis for rigid racial prefer-\nences would be to open the door to competing claims\nfor  ‘remedial  relief’  for  every  disadvantaged  group. \nThe dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society\nwhere race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and\nachievement  would  be  lost  in  a  mosaic  of  shifting \npreferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims \nof past wrongs.”  Id., at 505–506. \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  15 \nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \nFrom the standpoint of the victim, it is true, an injury \nstemming from racial prejudice can hurt as much when\nthe  demeaning  treatment  based  on  race  identity  stems\nfrom bias masked deep within the social order as when it \nis imposed by law.  The distinction between government\nand private action, furthermore, can be amorphous both as\na historical matter and as a matter of present-day finding \nof fact.  Laws arise from a culture and vice versa.  Neither \ncan  assign  to  the  other  all  responsibility  for  persisting\ninjustices.\nYet, like so many other legal categories that can overlap \nin some instances, the constitutional distinction between \nde jure and de facto segregation has been thought to be an \nimportant one.  It must be conceded its primary function\nin school cases was to delimit the powers of the Judiciary\nin the fashioning of remedies.  See, e.g., Milliken, supra, at \n746.  The  distinction  ought  not  to  be  altogether  disre-\ngarded, however, when we come to that most sensitive of\nall racial issues, an attempt by the government to treat \nwhole classes of persons differently based on the govern-\nment’s systematic classification of each individual by race. \nThere, too, the distinction serves as a limit on the exercise \nof a power that reaches to the very verge of constitutional \nauthority.  Reduction of an individual to an assigned racial\nidentity  for  differential  treatment  is  among  the  most\npernicious actions our government can undertake.  The \nallocation of governmental burdens and benefits, conten-\ntious under any circumstances, is even more divisive when \nallocations  are  made  on  the  basis  of  individual  racial \nclassifications.  See, e.g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, \n438 U. S. 265 (1978); Adarand, 515 U. S. 200. \nNotwithstanding these concerns, allocation of benefits \nand burdens through individual racial classifications was \nfound sometimes permissible in the context of remedies for \nde jure wrong.  Where there has been de jure segregation,\nthere  is  a  cognizable  legal  wrong,  and  the  courts  and \n\n16  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\nlegislatures have broad power to remedy it.  The remedy,\nthough, was limited in time and limited to the wrong.  The \nCourt has allowed school districts to remedy their prior de \njure segregation by classifying individual students based\non their race.  See North Carolina Bd. of Ed. v. Swann, \n402 U. S. 43, 45–46 (1971).  The limitation of this power to \ninstances where there has been de jure segregation serves \nto confine the nature, extent, and duration of governmen-\ntal reliance on individual racial classifications. \nThe cases here were argued upon the assumption, and\ncome  to  us  on  the  premise,  that  the  discrimination  in\nquestion did not result from de jure actions.  And when de \nfacto discrimination is at issue our tradition has been that \nthe remedial rules are different.  The State must seek \nalternatives  to  the  classification  and  differential  treat-\nment of individuals by race, at least absent some extraor-\ndinary showing not present here. \nC \nThe dissent refers to an opinion filed by Judge Kozinski\nin one of the cases now before us, and that opinion relied\nupon an opinion filed by Chief Judge Boudin in a case\npresenting an issue similar to the one here.  See post, at \n35 (citing 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193–1196 (CA9 2005) (concur-\nring opinion) (citing Comfort v. Lynn School Comm., 418 \nF. 3d 1, 27–29 (CA1  2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring))). \nThough this may oversimplify the matter a bit, one of the \nmain concerns underlying those opinions was this: If it is\nlegitimate for school authorities to work to avoid racial\nisolation in their schools, must they do so only by indirec-\ntion and general policies?  Does the Constitution mandate \nthis inefficient result?  Why may the authorities not rec-\nognize the problem in candid fashion and solve it alto-\ngether  through  resort  to  direct  assignments  based  on \nstudent racial classifications?  So, the argument proceeds,\nif race is the problem, then perhaps race is the solution. \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  17 \nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \nThe argument ignores the dangers presented by indi-\nvidual  classifications,  dangers  that  are  not  as  pressing\nwhen the same ends are achieved by more indirect means. \nWhen the government classifies an individual by race, it\nmust first define what it means to be of a race.  Who ex-\nactly is white and who is nonwhite?  To be forced to live \nunder a state-mandated racial label is inconsistent with \nthe dignity of individuals in our society.  And it is a label \nthat an individual is powerless to change.  Governmental \nclassifications that command people to march in different\ndirections  based  on  racial  typologies  can  cause  a  new\ndivisiveness.  The practice can lead to corrosive discourse,\nwhere race serves not as an element of our diverse heri-\ntage but instead as a bargaining chip in the political proc-\ness.  On the other hand race-conscious measures that do \nnot  rely  on  differential  treatment  based  on  individual \nclassifications present these problems to a lesser degree. \nThe idea that if race is the problem, race is the instru-\nment  with  which  to  solve  it  cannot  be  accepted  as  an \nanalytical leap forward.  And if this is a frustrating dual-\nity of the Equal Protection Clause it simply reflects the \nduality of our history and our attempts to promote free-\ndom  in  a  world  that  sometimes  seems  set  against  it.\nUnder our Constitution the individual, child or adult, can \nfind his own identity, can define her own persona, without \nstate intervention that classifies on the basis of his race or \nthe color of her skin.   \n*    *    * \nThis Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill \nits historic commitment to creating an integrated society\nthat ensures equal opportunity for all of its children.  A \ncompelling interest exists in avoiding racial isolation, an\ninterest that a school district, in its discretion and exper-\ntise, may choose to pursue.  Likewise, a district may con-\nsider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student \n\n18  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nOpinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\npopulation.  Race may be one component of that diversity, \nbut other demographic factors, plus special talents and \nneeds, should also be considered.  What the government is\nnot permitted to do, absent  a showing of necessity not \nmade here, is to classify every student on the basis of race\nand to assign each of them to schools based on that classi-\nfication.  Crude measures of this sort threaten to reduce \nchildren to racial chits valued and traded according to one \nschool’s supply and another’s demand.\nThat  statement,  to  be  sure,  invites  this  response:  A \nsense  of  stigma  may  already  become  the  fate  of  those \nseparated out by circumstances beyond their immediate \ncontrol.  But to this the replication must be:  Even so, \nmeasures other than differential treatment based on racial \ntyping of individuals first must be exhausted.   \nThe decision today should not prevent school districts\nfrom continuing the important work of bringing together \nstudents  of  different  racial,  ethnic,  and  economic  back-\ngrounds.  Due to a variety of factors—some influenced by \ngovernment, some not—neighborhoods in our communities\ndo  not  reflect  the  diversity  of  our  Nation  as  a  whole. \nThose  entrusted  with  directing  our  public  schools  can \nbring to bear the creativity of experts, parents, adminis-\ntrators,  and  other  concerned  citizens  to  find  a  way  to \nachieve the compelling interests they face without resort-\ning to widespread governmental allocation of benefits and \nburdens on the basis of racial classifications. \nWith this explanation I concur in the judgment of the\nCourt. \n\nCite as: 551 U.

Compare ante, at 39 (“history \nwill be heard”), with Brewer v. Quarterman, 550 U. S. ___, \n___ (2007) (slip op., at 11) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (“It \nis a familiar adage that history is written by the victors”). \nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE rejects the conclusion that the racial\nclassifications at issue here should be viewed differently\nthan others, because they do not impose burdens on one\nrace alone and do not stigmatize or exclude.3  The only\njustification for refusing to acknowledge the obvious im-\n—————— \n1Le Lys Rouge (The Red Lily) 95 (W.

The \nschool  board  plans  before  us  resemble  many  others \nadopted in the last 50 years by primary and secondary \nschools throughout the Nation.  All of those plans repre-\nsent local efforts to bring about the kind of racially inte-\ngrated education that Brown v. Board of Education, 347 \nU. S.  483  (1954),  long  ago  promised—efforts  that  this \nCourt has repeatedly required, permitted, and encouraged \nlocal authorities to undertake.  This Court has recognized \nthat the public interests at stake in such cases are “com-\n\n2  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\npelling.”  We have approved of “narrowly tailored” plans \nthat are no less race-conscious than the plans before us. \nAnd  we  have  understood  that  the  Constitution  permits \nlocal  communities  to  adopt  desegregation  plans  even \nwhere it does not require them to do so. \nThe plurality pays inadequate attention to this law, to \npast opinions’ rationales, their language, and the contexts\nin which they arise.  As a result, it reverses course and \nreaches  the  wrong  conclusion.    In  doing  so,  it  distorts\nprecedent, it misapplies the relevant constitutional princi-\nples, it announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by \nstate and local governments to deal effectively with the \ngrowing  resegregation  of  public  schools,  it  threatens  to\nsubstitute  for  present  calm  a  disruptive  round  of  race-\nrelated litigation, and it undermines Brown’s promise of\nintegrated  primary  and  secondary  education  that  local \ncommunities have sought to make a reality.  This cannot \nbe justified in the name of the Equal Protection Clause. \nI \nFacts \nThe historical and factual context in which these cases \narise is critical.  In Brown, this Court held that the gov-\nernment’s segregation of schoolchildren by race violates \nthe Constitution’s promise of equal protection.  The Court \nemphasized that “education is perhaps the most important \nfunction of state and local governments.”  347 U. S., at \n493.  And it thereby set the Nation on a path toward pub-\nlic school integration. \nIn dozens of subsequent cases, this Court told school \ndistricts previously segregated by law what they must do\nat  a  minimum  to  comply  with  Brown’s  constitutional \nholding.  The  measures  required  by  those  cases  often\nincluded  race-conscious  practices,  such  as  mandatory \nbusing and race-based restrictions on voluntary transfers. \nSee, e.g., Columbus Bd. of Ed. v. Penick, 443 U. S. 449, \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  3 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n455,  n. 3  (1979);  Davis  v.  Board  of  School  Comm’rs  of \nMobile Cty., 402 U. S. 33, 37–38 (1971); Green v. School \nBd. of New Kent Cty., 391 U. S. 430, 441–442 (1968). \nBeyond  those  minimum  requirements,  the  Court  left\nmuch of the determination of how to achieve integration to \nthe judgment of local communities.  Thus, in respect to\nrace-conscious desegregation measures that the Constitu-\ntion permitted, but did not require (measures similar to\nthose at issue here), this Court unanimously stated: \n“School  authorities  are  traditionally  charged  with\nbroad power to formulate and implement educational \npolicy and might well conclude, for example, that in\norder to prepare students to live in a pluralistic soci-\nety each school should have a prescribed ratio of Ne-\ngro to white students reflecting the proportion for the \ndistrict as a whole.  To do this as an educational pol-\nicy is within the broad discretionary powers of school \nauthorities.”  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of \nEd., 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971) (emphasis added). \nAs a result, different districts—some acting under court\ndecree, some acting in order to avoid threatened lawsuits, \nsome seeking to comply with federal administrative or-\nders,  some  acting  purely  voluntarily,  some  acting  after \nfederal  courts  had  dissolved  earlier  orders—adopted,\nmodified, and experimented with hosts of different kinds \nof plans, including race-conscious plans, all with a similar \nobjective: greater racial integration of public schools.  See \nF. Welch & A. Light, New Evidence on School Desegrega-\ntion v (1987) (hereinafter Welch) (prepared for the Com-\nmission on Civil Rights) (reviewing a sample of 125 school\ndistricts,  constituting  20%  of  national  public  school  en-\nrollment, that had experimented with nearly 300 different\nplans over 18 years).  The techniques that different dis-\ntricts have employed range “from voluntary transfer pro-\ngrams to mandatory reassignment.”  Id., at 21.

NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\ndesign of particular plans has been “dictated by both the \nlaw and the specific needs of the district.”  Ibid. \nOverall these efforts brought about considerable racial \nintegration.  More recently, however, progress has stalled.\nBetween  1968  and  1980,  the  number  of  black  children \nattending  a  school  where  minority  children  constituted\nmore than half of the school fell from 77% to 63% in the \nNation (from 81% to 57% in the South) but then reversed\ndirection by the year 2000, rising from 63% to 72% in the\nNation (from 57% to 69% in the South).  Similarly, be-\ntween 1968 and 1980, the number of black children at-\ntending schools that were more than 90% minority fell\nfrom 64% to 33% in the Nation (from 78% to 23% in the \nSouth), but that too reversed direction, rising by the year\n2000 from 33% to 37% in the Nation (from 23% to 31% in\nthe South).  As of 2002, almost 2.4 million students, or \nover 5% of all public school enrollment, attended schools \nwith a white population of less than 1%.  Of these, 2.3 \nmillion were black and Latino students, and only 72,000 \nwere white.  Today, more than one in six black children \nattend a school that is 99–100% minority.  See Appendix\nA, infra.  In light of the evident risk of a return to school\nsystems that are in fact (though not in law) resegregated, \nmany school districts have felt a need to maintain or to\nextend their integration efforts. \nThe upshot is that myriad school districts operating in\nmyriad circumstances have devised myriad plans, often\nwith race-conscious elements, all for the sake of eradicat-\ning earlier school segregation, bringing about integration, \nor preventing retrogression.  Seattle and Louisville are \ntwo such districts, and the histories of their present plans \nset forth typical school integration stories. \nI describe those histories at length in order to highlight \nthree important features of these cases.  First, the school \ndistricts’ plans serve “compelling interests” and are “nar-\nrowly  tailored”  on  any  reasonable  definition  of  those \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  5 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nterms.  Second, the distinction between de jure segregation\n(caused  by  school  systems)  and  de  facto  segregation\n(caused, e.g., by housing patterns or generalized societal \ndiscrimination)  is  meaningless  in  the  present  context,\nthereby dooming the plurality’s endeavor to find support \nfor its views in that distinction.  Third, real-world efforts \nto  substitute  racially  diverse  for  racially  segregated\nschools (however caused) are complex, to the point where \nthe Constitution cannot plausibly be interpreted to rule \nout categorically all local efforts to use means that are\n“conscious” of the race of individuals. \nIn both Seattle and Louisville, the local school districts \nbegan with schools that were highly segregated in fact.  In \nboth  cities  plaintiffs  filed  lawsuits  claiming  unconstitu-\ntional segregation.  In Louisville, a federal district court \nfound that school segregation reflected pre-Brown state \nlaws separating the races.  In Seattle, the plaintiffs al-\nleged that school segregation unconstitutionally reflected \nnot only generalized societal discrimination and residen-\ntial housing patterns, but also school board policies and \nactions that had helped to create, maintain, and aggravate\nracial segregation.  In Louisville, a federal court entered a \nremedial decree.  In Seattle, the parties settled after the\nschool district pledged to undertake a desegregation plan. \nIn both cities, the school boards adopted plans designed to\nachieve  integration  by  bringing  about  more  racially  di-\nverse schools.  In each city the school board modified its\nplan  several  times  in  light  of,  for  example,  hostility to \nbusing, the threat of resegregation, and the desirability of\nintroducing greater student choice.  And in each city, the \nschool boards’ plans have evolved over time in ways that \nprogressively  diminish  the  plans’  use  of  explicit  race-\nconscious criteria. \nThe  histories  that  follow  set  forth  these  basic  facts. \nThey are based upon numerous sources, which for ease of\nexposition I have cataloged, along with their correspond-\n\n6  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v. \nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \ning citations, at Appendix B, infra. \nA \nSeattle \n1. Segregation,  1945  to  1956.   During  and  just  after\nWorld  War  II,  significant  numbers  of  black  Americans \nbegan to make Seattle their home.  Few black residents \nlived outside the central section of the city.  Most worked \nat unskilled jobs.  Although black students made up about \n3%  of  the  total  Seattle  population  in  the  mid-1950’s, \nnearly all black children attended schools where a major-\nity of the population was minority.  Elementary schools in\ncentral Seattle were between 60% and 80% black; Gar-\nfield, the central district high school, was more than 50% \nminority;  schools  outside  the  central  and  southeastern \nsections of Seattle were virtually all white. \n2. Preliminary Challenges, 1956 to 1969.  In 1956, a \nmemo for the Seattle School Board reported that school\nsegregation reflected not only segregated housing patterns\nbut also school board policies that permitted white stu-\ndents to transfer out of black schools while restricting the \ntransfer of black students into white schools.  In 1958, \nblack parents whose children attended Harrison Elemen-\ntary School (with a black student population of over 75%) \nwrote the Seattle board, complaining that the “‘boundaries\nfor the Harrison Elementary School were not set in accor-\ndance with the long-established standards of the School \nDistrict . . . but were arbitrarily set with an end to exclud-\ning colored children from McGilvra School, which is adja-\ncent to the Harrison school district.’” \nIn 1963, at the insistence of the National Association for \nthe Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other\ncommunity groups, the school board adopted a new race-\nbased transfer policy.  The new policy added an explicitly \nracial criterion: If a place exists in a school, then, irrespec-\ntive of other transfer criteria, a white student may trans-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  7 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nfer to a predominantly black school, and a black student\nmay transfer to a predominantly white school.\nAt that time one high school, Garfield, was about two-\nthirds minority; eight high schools were virtually all white. \nIn 1963, the transfer program’s first year, 239 black stu-\ndents and 8 white students transferred.  In 1969, about \n2,200 (of 10,383 total) of the district’s black students and \nabout 400 of the district’s white students took advantage\nof the plan.  For the next decade, annual program trans-\nfers remained at approximately this level. \n3. The  NAACP’s  First  Legal  Challenge  and  Seattle’s \nResponse, 1969 to 1977.  In 1969 the NAACP filed a fed-\neral lawsuit against the school board, claiming that the\nboard  had  “unlawfully  and  unconstitutionally”  “estab-\nlish[ed]” and “maintain[ed]” a system of “racially segre-\ngated public schools.”  The complaint said that 77% of \nblack  public  elementary  school  students  in  Seattle  at-\ntended 9 of the city’s 86 elementary schools and that 23 of \nthe remaining schools had no black students at all.  Simi-\nlarly, of the 1,461 black students enrolled in the 12 senior \nhigh schools in Seattle, 1,151 (or 78.8%) attended 3 senior \nhigh schools, and 900 (61.6%) attended a single school, \nGarfield. \nThe  complaint  charged  that  the  school  board  had \nbrought about this segregated system in part by “mak[ing] \nand enforc[ing]” certain “rules and regulations,” in part by\n“drawing . . . boundary lines” and “executing school atten-\ndance policies” that would create and maintain “predomi-\nnantly Negro or non-white schools,” and in part by build-\ning schools “in such a manner as to restrict the Negro \nplaintiffs and the class they represent to predominantly\nnegro or non-white schools.”  The complaint also charged \nthat the board discriminated in assigning teachers. \nThe board responded to the lawsuit by introducing a\nplan  that  required  race-based  transfers  and  mandatory\nbusing.  The plan created three new middle schools at \n\n8  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nthree school buildings in the predominantly white north\nend.  It then created a “mixed” student body by assigning\nto  those  schools  students  who  would  otherwise  attend \npredominantly  white,  or  predominantly  black,  schools \nelsewhere.  It  used  explicitly  racial  criteria  in  making \nthese assignments (i.e., it deliberately assigned to the new \nmiddle schools black students, not white students, from \nthe black schools and white students, not black students, \nfrom the white schools).  And it used busing to transport \nthe students to their new assignments.  The plan provoked \nconsiderable local opposition.  Opponents brought a law-\nsuit.  But eventually a state court found that the manda-\ntory busing was lawful. \nIn 1976–1977, the plan involved the busing of about 500 \nmiddle school students (300 black students and 200 white\nstudents).  Another 1,200 black students and 400 white \nstudents participated in the previously adopted voluntary\ntransfer program.  Thus about 2,000 students out of a \ntotal  district  population  of  about  60,000  students  were\ninvolved in one or the other transfer program.  At that \ntime, about 20% or 12,000 of the district’s students were \nblack.  And the board continued to describe 26 of its 112 \nschools as “segregated.” \n4.  The  NAACP’s  Second  Legal  Challenge,  1977.    In  \n1977, the NAACP filed another legal complaint, this time\nwith the federal Department of Health, Education, and \nWelfare’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  The complaint\nalleged that the Seattle School Board had created or per-\npetuated unlawful racial segregation through, e.g., certain \nschool-transfer criteria, a construction program that need-\nlessly  built  new  schools  in  white  areas,  district  line-\ndrawing criteria, the maintenance of inferior facilities at \nblack  schools,  the  use  of  explicit  racial  criteria  in  the\nassignment  of  teachers  and  other  staff,  and  a  general \npattern of delay in respect to the implementation of prom-\nised desegregation efforts. \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  9 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nThe OCR and the school board entered into a formal \nsettlement agreement.  The agreement required the board\nto implement what became known as the “Seattle Plan.” \n5. The Seattle Plan: Mandatory Busing, 1978 to 1988. \nThe board began to implement the Seattle Plan in 1978.\nThis  plan  labeled  “racially  imbalanced”  any  school  at\nwhich the percentage of black students exceeded by more \nthan 20% the minority population of the school district as\na whole.  It applied that label to 26 schools, including 4 \nhigh  schools—Cleveland  (72.8%  minority),  Franklin \n(76.6% minority), Garfield (78.4% minority), and Rainier \nBeach (58.9% minority).  The plan paired (or “triaded”) \n“imbalanced”  black  schools  with  “imbalanced”  white \nschools.  It then placed some grades (say, third and fourth\ngrades) at one school building and other grades (say, fifth \nand sixth grades) at the other school building.  And it \nthereby required, for example, all fourth grade students\nfrom  the  previously  black  and  previously  white  schools \nfirst  to  attend  together  what  would  now  be  a  “mixed”\nfourth grade at one of the school buildings and then the \nnext year to attend what would now be a “mixed” fifth\ngrade at the other school building.\nAt the same time, the plan provided that a previous\n“black”  school  would  remain  about  50%  black,  while  a \nprevious  “white”  school  would  remain  about  two-thirds \nwhite.  It was consequently necessary to decide with some \ncare which students would attend the new “mixed” grade.\nFor  this  purpose,  administrators  cataloged  the  racial\nmakeup of each neighborhood housing block.  The school \ndistrict met its percentage goals by assigning to the new\n“mixed” school an appropriate number of “black” housing \nblocks  and  “white”  housing  blocks.    At  the  same  time, \ntransport from house to school involved extensive busing, \nwith about half of all students attending a school other \nthan the one closest to their home. \nThe Seattle Plan achieved the school integration that it \n\n10  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nsought.  Just prior to the plan’s implementation, for ex-\nample, 4 of Seattle’s 11 high schools were “imbalanced,” \ni.e.,  almost  exclusively  “black”  or  almost  exclusively\n“white.”  By 1979, only two were out of “balance.”  By 1980\nonly Cleveland remained out of “balance” (as the board\ndefined it) and that by a mere two students. \nNonetheless, the Seattle Plan, due to its busing, pro-\nvoked serious opposition within the State.  See generally \nWashington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, \n461–466 (1982).  Thus, Washington state voters enacted \nan initiative that amended state law to require students to \nbe assigned to the schools closest to their homes.  Id., at \n462.  The Seattle School Board challenged the constitu-\ntionality of the initiative.  Id., at 464.  This Court then \nheld that the initiative—which would have prevented the \nSeattle Plan from taking effect—violated the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Id., at 470. \n6. Student Choice, 1988 to 1998.  By 1988, many white\nfamilies had left the school district, and many Asian fami-\nlies had moved in.  The public school population had fallen \nfrom  about  100,000  to  less  than  50,000.  The  racial \nmakeup of the school population amounted to 43% white, \n24% black, and 23% Asian or Pacific Islander, with His-\npanics and Native Americans making up the rest.  The \ncost of busing, the harm that members of all racial com-\nmunities feared that the Seattle Plan caused, the desire to \nattract white families back to the public schools, and the \ninterest in providing greater school choice led the board to\nabandon busing and to substitute a new student assign-\nment policy that resembles the plan now before us. \nThe  new  plan  permitted  each  student  to  choose  the\nschool he or she wished to attend, subject to race-based\nconstraints.  In respect to high schools, for example, a\nstudent was given a list of a subset of schools, carefully \nselected by the board to balance racial distribution in the\ndistrict by including neighborhood schools and schools in \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  11 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nracially different neighborhoods elsewhere in the city.  The \nstudent could then choose among those schools, indicating\na first choice, and other choices the student found accept-\nable.  In  making  an  assignment  to  a  particular  high\nschool, the district would give first preference to a student\nwith a sibling already at the school.  It gave second prefer-\nence to a student whose race differed from a race that was \n“over-represented” at the school (i.e., a race that accounted \nfor a higher percentage of the school population than of \nthe total district population).  It gave third preference to\nstudents  residing  in  the  neighborhood.    It  gave  fourth\npreference  to  students  who  received  child  care  in  the\nneighborhood.  In a typical year, say, 1995, about 20,000\npotential  high  school  students  participated.  About  68% \nreceived their first choice.  Another 16% received an “ac-\nceptable” choice.  A further 16% were assigned to a school\nthey had not listed. \n7. The Current Plan, 1999 to the Present.  In 1996, the \nschool board adopted the present plan, which began in\n1999.  In doing so, it sought to deemphasize the use of\nracial criteria and to increase the likelihood that a student \nwould receive an assignment at his first or second choice\nhigh school.  The district retained a racial tiebreaker for \noversubscribed  schools,  which  takes  effect  only  if  the\nschool’s minority or majority enrollment falls outside of a \n30% range centered on the minority/majority population \nratio within the district.  At the same time, all students \nwere  free  subsequently  to  transfer  from  the  school  at \nwhich they were initially placed to a different school of\ntheir choice without regard to race.  Thus, at worst, a \nstudent would have to spend one year at a high school he\ndid not pick as a first or second choice.\nThe new plan worked roughly as expected for the two\nschool years during which it was in effect (1999–2000 and\n2000–2001).  In the 2000–2001 school year, for example,\nwith the racial tiebreaker, the entering ninth grade class \n\n12  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nat Franklin High School had a 60% minority population; \nwithout the racial tiebreaker that same class at Franklin \nwould have had an almost 80% minority population.  (We\nconsider only the ninth grade since only students entering \nthat class were subject to the tiebreaker, and because the\nplan was not in place long enough to change the composi-\ntion of an entire school.)  In the year 2005–2006, by which\ntime the racial tiebreaker had not been used for several \nyears, Franklin’s overall minority enrollment had risen to\n90%.  During the period the tiebreaker applied, it typically\naffected about 300 students per year.  Between 80% and \n90% of all students received their first choice assignment;\nbetween 89% and 97% received their first or second choice \nassignment.\nPetitioner  Parents  Involved  in  Community  Schools\nobjected to Seattle’s most recent plan under the State and \nFederal  Constitutions.  In  due  course,  the  Washington\nSupreme Court, the Federal District Court, and the Court \nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (sitting en banc) rejected\nthe challenge and found Seattle’s plan lawful. \nB \nLouisville \n1. Before the Lawsuit, 1954 to 1972.  In 1956, two years \nafter Brown made clear that Kentucky could no longer \nrequire racial segregation by law, the Louisville Board of \nEducation created a geography-based student assignment \nplan designed to help achieve school integration.  At the \nsame time it adopted an open transfer policy under which \napproximately  3,000  of  Louisville’s  46,000  students  ap-\nplied for transfer.  By 1972, however, the Louisville School \nDistrict remained highly segregated.  Approximately half \nthe  district’s  public  school  enrollment  was  black;  about\nhalf was white.  Fourteen of the district’s nineteen non-\nvocational middle and high schools were close to totally\nblack or totally white.  Nineteen of the district’s forty-six \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  13 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nelementary schools were between 80% and 100% black.\nTwenty-one elementary schools were between roughly 90% \nand 100% white. \n2. Court-Imposed Guidelines and Busing, 1972 to 1991.\nIn 1972, civil rights groups and parents, claiming uncon-\nstitutional segregation, sued the Louisville Board of Edu-\ncation in federal court.  The original litigation eventually \nbecame  a  lawsuit  against  the  Jefferson  County  School\nSystem, which in April 1975 absorbed Louisville’s schools\nand combined them with those of the surrounding sub-\nurbs.  (For ease of exposition, I shall still use “Louisville” \nto  refer  to  what  is  now  the  combined  districts.)    After \npreliminary rulings and an eventual victory for the plain-\ntiffs  in  the  Court  of Appeals  for  the  Sixth  Circuit,  the\nDistrict Court in July 1975 entered an order requiring \ndesegregation.\nThe order’s requirements reflected a (newly enlarged)\nschool district student population of about 135,000, ap-\nproximately 20% of whom were black.  The order required\nthe school board to create and to maintain schools with \nstudent populations that ranged, for elementary schools, \nbetween 12% and 40% black, and for secondary schools\n(with one exception), between 12.5% and 35% black. \nThe District Court also adopted a complex desegregation\nplan designed to achieve the order’s targets.  The plan\nrequired  redrawing  school  attendance  zones,  closing  12\nschools, and busing groups of students, selected by race \nand the first letter of their last names, to schools outside \ntheir immediate neighborhoods.  The plan’s initial busing \nrequirements  were  extensive,  involving  the  busing  of \n23,000  students  and  a  transportation  fleet  that  had  to\n“operate from early in the morning until late in the eve-\nning.”  For typical students, the plan meant busing for\nseveral years (several more years for typical black stu-\ndents  than  for  typical  white  students).    The  following\nnotice, published in a Louisville newspaper in 1976, gives \n\n14  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\na sense of how the district’s race-based busing plan oper-\nated in practice: \nLouisville Courier Journal, June 18, 1976 (reproduced in\nJ. Wilkinson, From Brown to Bakke: The Supreme Court\nand School Integration 1954–1978, p. 176 (1979)). \nThe  District  Court  monitored  implementation  of  the \nplan.  In 1978, it found that the plan had brought all of \nLouisville’s schools within its “‘guidelines’ for racial com-\nposition” for “at least a substantial portion of the [previ-\nous] three years.”  It removed the case from its active \ndocket while stating that it expected the board “to con-\ntinue  to  implement  those  portions  of  the  desegregation\norder which are by their nature of a continuing effect.” \nBy 1984, after several schools had fallen out of compli-\nance with the order’s racial percentages due to shifting\ndemographics in the community, the school board revised \nits desegregation plan.  In doing so, the board created a \nnew racial “guideline,” namely a “floating range of 10% \nabove  and  10%  below  the  countywide  average  for  the\ndifferent grade levels.”  The board simultaneously redrew\ndistrict boundaries so that middle school students could \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  15 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nattend the same school for three years and high school\nstudents for four years.  It added “magnet” programs at \ntwo  high  schools.    And  it  adjusted  its  alphabet-based \nsystem  for  grouping  and  busing  students.    The  board \nestimated that its new plan would lead to annual reas-\nsignment (with busing) of about 8,500 black students and \nabout 8,000 white students. \n3. Student  Choice  and  Project  Renaissance,  1991  to \n1996.  By 1991, the board had concluded that assigning \nelementary school students to two or more schools during\ntheir  elementary  school  years  had  proved  educationally \nunsound and, if continued, would undermine Kentucky’s\nnewly  adopted  Education  Reform  Act.    It  consequently\nconducted a nearly year-long review of its plan.  In doing\nso, it consulted widely with parents and other members of \nthe  local  community,  using  public  presentations,  public\nmeetings, and various other methods to obtain the public’s\ninput.  At the conclusion of this review, the board adopted \na new plan, called “Project Renaissance,” that emphasized \nstudent choice. \nProject  Renaissance  again  revised  the  board’s  racial\nguidelines.  It provided that each elementary school would\nhave a black student population of between 15% and 50%; \neach middle and high school would have a black popula-\ntion and a white population that fell within a range, the\nboundaries of which were set at 15% above and 15% below \nthe general student population percentages in the county\nat that grade level.  The plan then drew new geographical \nschool assignment zones designed to satisfy these guide-\nlines;  the  district  could  reassign  students  if  particular\nschools failed to meet the guidelines and was required to\ndo so if a school repeatedly missed these targets. \nIn respect to elementary schools, the plan first drew a \nneighborhood line around each elementary school, and it\nthen  drew  a  second  line  around  groups  of  elementary \nschools (called “clusters”).  It initially assigned each stu-\n\n16  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\ndent to his or her neighborhood school, but it permitted \neach student freely to transfer between elementary schools \nwithin each cluster provided that the transferring student \n(a) was black if transferring from a predominantly black \nschool to a predominantly white school, or (b) was white if\ntransferring from a predominantly white school to a pre-\ndominantly  black  school.    Students  could  also  apply  to \nattend magnet elementary schools or programs. \nThe  plan  required  each  middle  school  student  to  be \nassigned  to  his  or  her  neighborhood  school  unless  the \nstudent applied for, and was accepted by, a magnet middle \nschool.  The plan provided for “open” high school enroll-\nment.  Every 9th or 10th grader could apply to any high\nschool in the system, and the high school would accept \napplicants  according  to  set  criteria—one  of  which  con-\nsisted of the need to attain or remain in compliance with \nthe plan’s racial guidelines.  Finally, the plan created two \nnew  magnet  schools,  one  each  at  the  elementary  and \nmiddle school levels. \n4. The  Current  Plan:  Project  Renaissance  Modified, \n1996 to 2003.  In 1995 and 1996, the Louisville School \nBoard, with the help of a special “Planning Team,” com-\nmunity meetings, and other official and unofficial study \ngroups, monitored the effects of Project Renaissance and \nconsidered proposals for improvement.  Consequently, in\n1996,  the  board  modified  Project  Renaissance,  thereby\ncreating the present plan. \nAt the time, the district’s public school population was\napproximately 30% black.  The plan consequently redrew\nthe racial “guidelines,” setting the boundaries at 15% to\n50% black for all schools.  It again redrew school assign-\nment boundaries.  And it expanded the transfer opportuni-\nties available to elementary and middle school pupils.  The \nplan forbade transfers, however, if the transfer would lead\nto a school population outside the guideline range, i.e., if it \nwould create a school where fewer than 15% or more than \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  17 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n50% of the students were black. \nThe plan also established “Parent Assistance Centers” \nto help parents and students navigate the school selection\nand assignment process.  It pledged the use of other re-\nsources in order to “encourage all schools to achieve an\nAfrican-American  enrollment  equivalent  to  the  average\ndistrict-wide African-American enrollment at the school’s \nrespective elementary, middle or high school level.”  And \nthe plan continued use of magnet schools.\nIn 1999, several parents brought a lawsuit in federal \ncourt attacking the plan’s use of racial guidelines at one of \nthe district’s magnet schools.  They asked the court to\ndissolve the desegregation order and to hold the use of \nmagnet  school  racial  guidelines  unconstitutional.    The \nboard  opposed  dissolution,  arguing  that  “the  old  dual\nsystem”  had  left  a  “demographic  imbalance”  that  “pre-\nvent[ed] dissolution.”  In 2000, after reviewing the present \nplan, the District Court dissolved the 1975 order.  It wrote \nthat there was “overwhelming evidence of the Board’s good\nfaith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its\nunderlying purposes.”  It added that the Louisville School \nBoard had “treated the ideal of an integrated system as\nmuch  more  than  a  legal  obligation—they  consider  it  a\npositive, desirable policy and an essential element of any \nwell-rounded public school education.”\nThe Court also found that the magnet programs avail-\nable at the high school in question were “not available at \nother high schools” in the school district.  It consequently\nheld unconstitutional the use of race-based “targets” to \ngovern admission to magnet schools.  And it ordered the \nboard  not  to  control  access  to  those  scarce  programs\nthrough the use of racial targets. \n5. The Current Lawsuit, 2003 to the Present.  Subse-\nquent to the District Court’s dissolution of the desegrega-\ntion order (in 2000) the board simply continued to imple-\nment  its  1996  plan  as  modified  to  reflect  the  court’s \n\n18  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nmagnet school determination.  In 2003, the petitioner now \nbefore us, Crystal Meredith, brought this lawsuit challeng-\ning the plan’s unmodified portions, i.e., those portions that \ndealt with ordinary, not magnet, schools.  Both the Dis-\ntrict Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit \nrejected  Meredith’s  challenge  and  held  the  unmodified \naspects of the plan constitutional. \nC \nThe histories I have set forth describe the extensive and \nongoing  efforts  of  two  school  districts  to  bring  about\ngreater racial integration of their public schools.  In both \ncases the efforts were in part remedial.  Louisville began\nits integration efforts in earnest when a federal court in\n1975 entered a school desegregation order.  Seattle under-\ntook its integration efforts in response to the filing of a\nfederal lawsuit and as a result of its settlement of a segre-\ngation complaint filed with the federal OCR. \nThe plans in both Louisville and Seattle grow out of \nthese earlier remedial efforts.  Both districts faced prob-\nlems that reflected initial periods of severe racial segrega-\ntion, followed by such remedial efforts as busing, followed \nby evidence of resegregation, followed by a need to end \nbusing and encourage the return of, e.g., suburban stu-\ndents through increased student choice.  When formulat-\ning the plans under review, both districts drew upon their \nconsiderable experience with earlier plans, having revised\ntheir policies periodically in light of that experience.  Both \ndistricts rethought their methods over time and explored a \nwide range of other means, including non-race-conscious\npolicies.  Both districts also considered elaborate studies \nand consulted widely within their communities.  \nBoth  districts  sought  greater  racial  integration  for\neducational and democratic, as well as for remedial, rea-\nsons.  Both sought to achieve these objectives while pre-\nserving their commitment to other educational goals, e.g., \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  19 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \ndistrictwide commitment to high quality public schools,\nincreased  pupil  assignment  to  neighborhood  schools, \ndiminished use of busing, greater student choice, reduced\nrisk of white flight, and so forth.  Consequently, the pre-\nsent plans expand student choice; they limit the burdens\n(including busing) that earlier plans had imposed upon\nstudents and their families; and they use race-conscious\ncriteria in limited and gradually diminishing ways.  In \nparticular, they use race-conscious criteria only to mark\nthe outer bounds of broad population-related ranges. \nThe  histories  also  make  clear  the  futility  of  looking \nsimply to whether earlier school segregation was de jure or \nde facto in order to draw firm lines separating the consti-\ntutionally permissible from the constitutionally forbidden\nuse of “race-conscious” criteria.  JUSTICE THOMAS suggests\nthat it will be easy to identify de jure segregation because\n“[i]n most cases, there either will or will not have been a\nstate constitutional amendment, state statute, local ordi-\nnance, or local administrative policy explicitly requiring \nseparation of the races.”  Ante, at 6, n. 4 (concurring opin-\nion).  But our precedent has recognized that de jure dis-\ncrimination can be present even in the absence of racially\nexplicit laws.  See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 373– \n374 (1886).\nNo one here disputes that Louisville’s segregation was \nde jure.  But what about Seattle’s?  Was it de facto?  De \njure?  A mixture?  Opinions differed.  Or is it that a prior\nfederal court had not adjudicated the matter?  Does that \nmake a difference?  Is Seattle free on remand to say that \nits schools were de jure segregated, just as in 1956 a memo \nfor the School Board admitted?  The plurality does not \nseem confident as to the answer.  Compare ante, at 12 \n(opinion of the Court) (“[T]he Seattle public schools have \nnever shown that they were ever segregated by law” (em-\nphasis  added)),  with  ante  at  29–30  (plurality  opinion)\n(assuming  “the  Seattle  school  district  was  never  segre-\n\n20  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\ngated by law,” but seeming to concede that a school dis-\ntrict with de jure segregation need not be subject to a court \norder  to  be  allowed  to  engage  in  race-based  remedial \nmeasures).\nA court finding of de jure segregation cannot be the \ncrucial variable.  After all, a number of school districts in \nthe  South  that  the  Government  or  private  plaintiffs\nchallenged as segregated by law voluntarily desegregated \ntheir schools without a court order—just as Seattle did.\nSee, e.g., Coleman, Desegregation of the Public Schools \nin  Kentucky—The  Second  Year  After  the  Supreme \nCourt’s Decision, 25 J. Negro Educ. 254, 256, 261 (1956)\n(40  of  Kentucky’s  180  school  districts  began  desegre-\ngation  without  court  orders);  Branton,  Little  Rock \nRevisited: Desegregation to Resegregation, 52 J.

S. 39,  40,  n.  1  (1971)  (Clarke  County, \nGeorgia).    See  also  Letter  from  Robert  F.  Kennedy, \nAttorney General, to John F.

How could such a plan be lawful the day \nbefore dissolution but then become unlawful the very next \nday?  On what legal ground can the majority rest its con-\ntrary view?  But see ante, at 12–13, 17, n. 12. \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  21 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nAre courts really to treat as merely de facto segregated\nthose school districts that avoided a federal order by vol-\nuntarily complying with Brown’s requirements?  See id., \nat 12, 29–30.  This Court has previously done just the \nopposite, permitting a race-conscious remedy without any\nkind of court decree.  See McDaniel, supra, at 41.  Because \nthe Constitution emphatically does not forbid the use of\nrace-conscious  measures  by  districts  in  the  South  that\nvoluntarily desegregated their schools, on what basis does\nthe plurality claim that the law forbids Seattle to do the\nsame?  But see ante, at 29. \nThe histories also indicate the complexity of the tasks\nand the practical difficulties that local school boards face\nwhen they seek to achieve greater racial integration.  The \nboards work in communities where demographic patterns \nchange, where they must meet traditional learning goals, \nwhere  they  must  attract  and  retain  effective  teachers, \nwhere  they  should  (and  will)  take  account  of  parents’ \nviews  and  maintain  their  commitment  to  public  school\neducation, where they must adapt to court intervention,\nwhere they must encourage voluntary student and parent\naction—where they will find that their own good faith, \ntheir knowledge, and their understanding of local circum-\nstances are always necessary but often insufficient to solve\nthe problems at hand.\nThese facts and circumstances help explain why in this \ncontext, as to means, the law often leaves legislatures, city \ncouncils, school boards, and voters with a broad range of \nchoice, thereby giving “different communities” the oppor-\ntunity to “try different solutions to common problems and\ngravitate toward those that prove most successful or seem \nto them best to suit their individual needs.”  Comfort v. \nLynn School Comm., 418 F. 3d 1, 28 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, \nC.

Because  of  its  importance,  I  shall\nrepeat what this Court said about the matter in Swann. \nChief Justice Burger, on behalf of a unanimous Court in a\ncase of exceptional importance, wrote: \n“School authorities are traditionally charged with\nbroad power to formulate and implement educational \npolicy and might well conclude, for example, that in\norder to prepare students to live in a pluralistic soci-\nety each school should have a prescribed ratio of Ne-\ngro to white students reflecting the proportion for the \ndistrict as a whole.  To do this as an educational policy \nis within the broad discretionary powers of school au-\nthorities.”  402 U. S., at 16. \nThe statement was not a technical holding in the case. \nBut  the  Court  set  forth  in  Swann  a  basic  principle  of\nconstitutional law—a principle of law that has found “wide\nacceptance  in  the  legal  culture.”    Dickerson  v.  United \nStates,  530  U.  S.  428,  443  (2000)  (internal  quotation \nmarks omitted); Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314, \n330 (1999); id., at 331, 332 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citing\n“‘wide acceptance in the legal culture’” as “adequate rea-\nson not to overrule” prior cases). \n  Thus, in North Carolina Bd. of Ed. v. Swann, 402 U. S. \n43, 45 (1971), this Court, citing Swann, restated the point.\n“[S]chool authorities,” the Court said, “have wide discre-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  23 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \ntion in formulating school policy, and . . . as a matter of \neducational  policy  school  authorities  may  well  conclude\nthat some kind of racial balance in the schools is desirable \nquite apart from any constitutional requirements.”  Then-\nJustice Rehnquist echoed this view in Bustop, Inc. v. Los \nAngeles Bd. of Ed., 439 U. S. 1380, 1383 (1978) (opinion in\nchambers), making clear that he too believed that Swann’s \nstatement reflected settled law: “While I have the gravest\ndoubts that [a state supreme court] was required by the \nUnited  States  Constitution  to  take  the  [desegregation]\naction that it has taken in this case, I have very little\ndoubt that it was permitted by that Constitution to take \nsuch action.”  (Emphasis in original.)\nThese statements nowhere suggest that this freedom is\nlimited to school districts where court-ordered desegrega-\ntion measures are also in effect.  Indeed, in McDaniel, a \ncase decided the same day as Swann, a group of parents\nchallenged a race-conscious student assignment plan that \nthe Clarke County School Board had voluntarily adopted\nas a remedy without a court order (though under federal \nagency pressure—pressure Seattle also encountered).  The \nplan required that each elementary school in the district\nmaintain  20%  to  40%  enrollment  of  African-American \nstudents, corresponding to the racial composition of the\ndistrict.  See Barresi v. Browne, 226 Ga. 456, 456–459, 175 \nS. E. 2d 649, 650–651 (1970).  This Court upheld the plan, \nsee  McDaniel,  402  U. S.,  at  41,  rejecting  the  parents’ \nargument that “a person may not be included or excluded \nsolely because he is a Negro or because he is white.”  Brief \nfor Respondents in McDaniel, O. T. 1970, No. 420, p. 25. \nFederal  authorities  had  claimed—as  the  NAACP  and \nthe OCR did in Seattle—that Clarke County schools were \nsegregated in law, not just in fact.  The plurality’s claim \nthat Seattle was “never segregated by law” is simply not \naccurate.  Compare ante, at 29, with supra, at 6–9.  The \nplurality could validly claim that no court ever found that \n\n24  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Unless we \nbelieve that the Constitution enforces one legal standard\nfor the South and another for the North, this Court should \ngrant Seattle the permission it granted Clarke County, \nGeorgia.  See  McDaniel,  402  U. S.,  at  41  (“[S]teps  will\nalmost invariably require that students be assigned ‘dif-\nferently because of their race.’ . . . Any other approach\nwould freeze the status quo that is the very target of all\ndesegregation processes.”).\nThis Court has also held that school districts may be\nrequired  by  federal  statute  to  undertake  race-conscious\ndesegregation efforts even when there is no likelihood that \nde jure segregation can be shown.  In Board of Ed. of City \nSchool Dist. of New York v. Harris, 444 U. S. 130, 148–149 \n(1979), the Court concluded that a federal statute required \nschool districts receiving certain federal funds to remedy\nfaculty segregation, even though in this Court’s view the\nracial disparities in the affected schools were purely de \nfacto and would not have been actionable under the Equal \nProtection Clause.  Not even the dissenters thought the\nrace-conscious  remedial  program  posed  a  constitutional \nproblem.  See id., at 152 (opinion of Stewart, J.).  See also, \ne.g., Crawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, 458 U. S. \n527, 535–536 (1982) (“[S]tate courts of California continue\nto have an obligation under state law to order segregated \nschool districts to use voluntary desegregation techniques, \nwhether  or  not  there  has  been  a  finding  of  intentional \nsegregation.  .  .  .  [S]chool  districts  themselves  retain  a \nstate-law obligation to take reasonably feasible steps to \ndesegregate, and they remain free to adopt reassignment \nand busing plans to effectuate desegregation” (emphasis\nadded)); School Comm. of Boston v.

Indeed,  in  1968,  the  Illinois  Supreme\nCourt  rejected  an  equal  protection  challenge  to  a  race-\nconscious state law seeking to undo de facto segregation: \n“To  support  [their]  claim,  the  defendants  heavily \nrely on three Federal cases, each of which held, no \nState law being involved, that a local school board\ndoes not have an affirmative constitutional duty to act \nto alleviate racial imbalance in the schools that it did \nnot cause.  However, the question as to whether the \nconstitution requires a local school board, or a State, \nto act to undo de facto school segregation is simply not\nhere concerned.  The issue here is whether the consti-\ntution permits, rather than prohibits, voluntary State \naction aimed toward reducing and eventually elimi-\nnating de facto school segregation.\n“State laws or administrative policies, directed to-\nward  the  reduction  and  eventual  elimination  of  de \nfacto segregation of children in the schools and racial \nimbalance, have been approved by every high State \ncourt which has considered the issue.  Similarly, the\nFederal courts which have considered the issue . . . \nhave  recognized  that  voluntary  programs  of  local\nschool authorities designed to alleviate de facto segre-\ngation  and  racial  imbalance  in  the  schools  are  not \nconstitutionally forbidden.”  Tometz v.

In this respect, Swann was not a sharp or unex-\npected departure from prior rulings; it reflected a consen-\nsus  that  had  already  emerged  among  state  and  lower \nfederal courts. \nIf there were doubts before Swann was decided, they did \nnot survive this Court’s decision.  Numerous state and \nfederal courts explicitly relied upon Swann’s guidance for \ndecades to follow.  For instance, a Texas appeals court in\n1986  rejected  a  Fourteenth  Amendment  challenge  to  a \nvoluntary integration plan by explaining: \n“[T]he absence of a court order to desegregate does not\nmean that a school board cannot exceed minimum re-\nquirements  in  order  to  promote  school  integration. \nSchool authorities are traditionally given broad dis-\ncretionary powers to formulate and implement educa-\ntional  policy  and  may  properly  decide  to  ensure  to \ntheir students the value of an integrated school ex-\nperience.”  Citizens for Better Ed. v.

Like the Texas \ncourt,  the  Ninth  Circuit  relied  upon  Swann  and  North \nCarolina Bd. of Ed. to reject the argument that “a race-\nconscious plan is permissible only when there has been a \njudicial finding of de jure segregation.”  610 F. 2d, at 663– \n664.  See also, e.g., Darville v. Dade County School Bd., \n497 F. 2d 1002, 1004–1006 (CA5 1974); State ex rel. Citi-\nzens Against Mandatory Bussing v.

These decisions illustrate \nwell how lower courts understood and followed Swann’s \nenunciation of the relevant legal principle. \nCourts  are  not  alone  in  accepting  as  constitutionally\nvalid the legal principle that Swann enunciated—i.e., that \nthe  government  may  voluntarily  adopt  race-conscious \nmeasures to improve conditions of race even when it is not \nunder a constitutional obligation to do so.  That principle \nhas been accepted by every branch of government and is\nrooted in the history of the Equal Protection Clause itself. \nThus,  Congress  has  enacted  numerous  race-conscious \nstatutes  that  illustrate  that  principle  or  rely  upon  its \nvalidity.  See, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §6311(b)(2)(C)(v) (No Child \nLeft Behind Act); §1067 et seq. (authorizing aid to minority\ninstitutions).  In fact, without being exhaustive, I have\ncounted 51 federal statutes that use racial classifications. \nI have counted well over 100 state statutes that similarly \nemploy racial classifications.  Presidential administrations \nfor the past half-century have used and supported various\nrace-conscious measures.  See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 10925, \n26  Fed.  Reg.  1977  (1961)  (President  Kennedy);  Exec. \nOrder No. 11246, 30 Fed. Reg. 12319 (1965) (President \n\n28  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

And during the same time, hundreds of \nlocal  school  districts  have  adopted  student  assignment\nplans that use race-conscious criteria.  See Welch 83–91. \nThat Swann’s legal statement should find such broad \nacceptance  is not surprising.  For Swann is predicated \nupon  a  well-established  legal  view  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment.  That view understands the basic objective of \nthose who wrote the Equal Protection Clause as forbidding \npractices that lead to racial exclusion.  The Amendment \nsought  to  bring  into  American  society  as  full  members \nthose whom the Nation had previously held in slavery. \nSee Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1872) (“[N]o\none can fail to be impressed with the one pervading pur-\npose found in [all the Reconstruction amendments] . . . we\nmean the freedom of the slave race”); Strauder v. West \nVirginia,  100  U.  S.  303,  306  (1879)  (“[The  Fourteenth\nAmendment] is one of a series of constitutional provisions\nhaving  a  common  purpose;  namely,  securing  to  a  race \nrecently emancipated . . . all the civil rights that the supe-\nrior race enjoy”).\nThere is reason to believe that those who drafted an \nAmendment with this basic purpose in mind would have\nunderstood the legal and practical difference between the \nuse of race-conscious criteria in defiance of that purpose, \nnamely  to  keep  the  races  apart,  and  the  use  of  race-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  29 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nconscious criteria to further that purpose, namely to bring \nthe races together.  See generally R. Sears, A Utopian\nExperiment in Kentucky: Integration and Social Equality \nat Berea, 1866–1904 (1996) (describing federal funding, \nthrough the Freedman’s Bureau, of race-conscious school \nintegration programs).  See also R. Fischer, The Segrega-\ntion Struggle in Louisiana 1862–77, p. 51 (1974) (describ-\ning the use of race-conscious remedies); Harlan, Desegre-\ngation  in  New  Orleans  Public  Schools  During\nReconstruction, 67 Am.

Vaughn, Schools for All: The Blacks and Public Educa-\ntion in the South, 1865–1877, pp. 111–116 (1974) (same). \nAlthough  the  Constitution  almost  always  forbids  the \nformer, it is significantly more lenient in respect to the \nlatter.  See Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 301 (2003) \n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. \nPeña, 515 U. S. 200, 243 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\nSometimes Members of this Court have disagreed about \nthe degree of leniency that the Clause affords to programs \ndesigned  to  include.  See  Wygant  v.  Jackson  Board  of \nEducation,  476  U.  S.  267,  274  (1986);  Fullilove  v. \nKlutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 507 (1980).  But I can find no \ncase in which this Court has followed JUSTICE THOMAS’ \n“colorblind”  approach.    And  I  have  found  no  case  that \notherwise  repudiated  this  constitutional  asymmetry  be-\ntween that which seeks to exclude and that which seeks to \ninclude members of minority races.\nWhat does the plurality say in response?  First, it seeks \nto  distinguish  Swann  and  other  similar  cases  on  the \nground  that  those  cases  involved  remedial  plans  in  re-\nsponse  to  judicial  findings  of  de  jure  segregation.  As \nMcDaniel  and  Harris  show,  that  is  historically  untrue. \nSee supra, at 22–24.  Many school districts in the South\nadopted  segregation  remedies  (to  which  Swann  clearly\napplies) without any such federal order, see supra, at 19– \n20.  See also Kennedy Report.  Seattle’s circumstances are \n\n30  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nnot meaningfully different from those in, say, McDaniel, \nwhere  this  Court  approved  race-conscious  remedies. \nLouisville’s plan was created and initially adopted when a\ncompulsory district court order was in place.  And, in any\nevent, the histories of Seattle and Louisville make clear \nthat  this  distinction—between  court-ordered  and  volun-\ntary desegregation—seeks a line that sensibly cannot be\ndrawn. \nSecond,  the  plurality  downplays  the  importance  of \nSwann and related cases by frequently describing their \nrelevant statements as “dicta.”  These criticisms, however, \nmiss the main point.  Swann did not hide its understand-\ning of the law in a corner of an obscure opinion or in a \nfootnote,  unread  but  by  experts.   It  set  forth  its  view \nprominently in an important opinion joined by all nine \nJustices,  knowing  that  it  would  be  read  and  followed \nthroughout the Nation.  The basic problem with the plu-\nrality’s technical “dicta”-based response lies in its overly \ntheoretical approach to case law, an approach that empha-\nsizes rigid distinctions between holdings and dicta in a \nway  that  serves  to  mask  the  radical  nature  of  today’s\ndecision.  Law is not an exercise in mathematical logic. \nAnd statements of a legal rule set forth in a judicial opin-\nion do not always divide neatly into “holdings” and “dicta.”\n(Consider the legal “status” of Justice Powell’s separate \nopinion in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 \n(1978).)  The  constitutional  principle  enunciated  in \nSwann, reiterated in subsequent cases, and relied upon\nover many years, provides, and has widely been thought to\nprovide, authoritative legal guidance.  And if the plurality\nnow chooses to reject that principle, it cannot adequately \njustify its retreat simply by affixing the label “dicta” to\nreasoning with which it disagrees.  Rather, it must explain\nto the courts and to the Nation why it would abandon \nguidance set forth many years before, guidance that count-\nless others have built upon over time, and which the law \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  31 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nhas continuously embodied.\nThird,  a  more  important  response  is  the  plurality’s\nclaim that later cases—in particular Johnson, Adarand, \nand Grutter—supplanted Swann.  See ante, at 11–12, 31– \n32, n. 16, 34–35 (citing Adarand, supra, at 227; Johnson v. \nCalifornia, 543 U. S. 499, 505 (2005); Grutter v. Bollinger, \n539 U. S. 306, 326 (2003)).  The plurality says that cases \nsuch as Swann and the others I have described all “were \ndecided before this Court definitively determined that ‘all \nracial classifications . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing\ncourt under strict scrutiny.’”  Ante, at 31, n. 16 (quoting \nAdarand, 515 U. S., at 227).  This Court in Adarand added \nthat “such classifications are constitutional only if they are\nnarrowly tailored measures that further compelling gov-\nernmental interests.”  Ibid.  And the Court repeated this \nsame statement in Grutter.  See 539 U. S., at 326. \nSeveral of these cases were significantly more restrictive\nthan Swann in respect to the degree of leniency the Four-\nteenth  Amendment  grants  to  programs  designed  to  in-\nclude people of all races.  See, e.g., Adarand, supra; Gratz, \nsupra; Grutter, supra.  But that legal circumstance cannot \nmake a critical difference here for two separate reasons.   \nFirst,  no  case—not  Adarand,  Gratz,  Grutter,  or  any\nother—has  ever  held  that  the  test  of  “strict  scrutiny”\nmeans that all racial classifications—no matter whether \nthey  seek  to  include  or  exclude—must  in  practice  be \ntreated the same.  The Court did not say in Adarand or in \nJohnson or in Grutter that it was overturning Swann or \nits central constitutional principle.   \nIndeed, in its more recent opinions, the Court recognized\nthat the “fundamental purpose” of strict scrutiny review is\nto  “take  relevant  differences”  between  “fundamentally\ndifferent situations . . . into account.”  Adarand, supra, at \n228 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court made \nclear that “[s]trict scrutiny does not trea[t] dissimilar race-\nbased  decisions  as  though  they  were  equally  objection-\n\n32  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nable.”  Ibid.  It added that the fact that a law “treats [a\nperson]  unequally  because  of  his  or  her  race  .  .  .  says\nnothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law.” \nId., at 229–230 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And \nthe Court, using the very phrase that Justice Marshall \nhad used to describe strict scrutiny’s application to any \nexclusionary use of racial criteria, sought to “dispel the \nnotion that strict scrutiny” is as likely to condemn inclu-\nsive uses of “race-conscious” criteria as it is to invalidate \nexclusionary uses.  That is, it is not in all circumstances \n“‘strict in theory, but fatal in fact.’”  Id., at 237 (quoting \nFullilove  v.  Klutznick,  448  U. S.,  at  519  (Marshall,  J., \nconcurring in judgment)). \nThe Court in Grutter elaborated: \n“Strict scrutiny is not ‘strict in theory, but fatal in \nfact.’  .  .  .  Although  all  governmental  uses  of  race\nare subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated\nby it. . . .\n“Context matters when reviewing race-based gov-\nernmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.\nSee  Gomillion  v.  Lightfoot,  364  U. S.  339,  343–344 \n(1960) (admonishing that, ‘in dealing with claims un-\nder broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive\ncontent by an interpretive process of inclusion and ex-\nclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on\nand qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise \nto them, must not be applied out of context in disre-\ngard of variant controlling facts’). . . . Not every deci-\nsion influenced by race is equally objectionable, and\nstrict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for\ncarefully examining the importance and the sincerity\nof  the  reasons  advanced  by  the  governmental  deci-\nsionmaker for the use of race in that particular con-\ntext.”  539 U. S., at 326–327. \nThe  Court’s  holding  in  Grutter  demonstrates  that  the \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  33 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nCourt meant what it said, for the Court upheld an elite \nlaw school’s race-conscious admissions program.   \nThe  upshot  is  that  the  cases  to  which  the  plurality\nrefers,  though  all  applying  strict  scrutiny,  do  not  treat\nexclusive and inclusive uses the same.  Rather, they apply\nthe strict scrutiny test in a manner that is “fatal in fact” \nonly to racial classifications that harmfully exclude; they\napply the test in a manner that is not fatal in fact to racial \nclassifications that seek to include. \nThe plurality cannot avoid this simple fact.  See ante, at \n34–36.  Today’s opinion reveals that the plurality would \nrewrite this Court’s prior jurisprudence, at least in practi-\ncal application, transforming the “strict scrutiny” test into\na rule that is fatal in fact across the board.  In doing so,\nthe plurality parts company from this Court’s prior cases,\nand it takes from local government the longstanding legal \nright to use race-conscious criteria for inclusive purposes \nin limited ways.\n  Second,  as  Grutter  specified,  “[c]ontext  matters  when\nreviewing  race-based  governmental  action  under  the\nEqual Protection Clause.”  539 U. S., at 327 (citing Gomil-\nlion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343–344 (1960)).  And \ncontexts differ dramatically one from the other.  Govern-\nmental use of race-based criteria can arise in the context \nof, for example, census forms, research expenditures for\ndiseases,  assignments  of  police  officers  patrolling  pre-\ndominantly minority-race neighborhoods, efforts to deseg-\nregate  racially  segregated  schools,  policies  that  favor \nminorities  when  distributing  goods  or  services  in  short \nsupply,  actions  that  create  majority-minority  electoral\ndistricts, peremptory strikes that remove potential jurors\non the basis of race, and others.  Given the significant \ndifferences among these contexts, it would be surprising if\nthe law required an identically strict legal test for evaluat-\ning the constitutionality of race-based criteria as to each of\nthem. \n\n34  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nHere, the context is one in which school districts seek to \nadvance or to maintain racial integration in primary and \nsecondary schools.  It is a context, as Swann makes clear, \nwhere history has required special administrative reme-\ndies.  And it is a context in which the school boards’ plans \nsimply set race-conscious limits at the outer boundaries of\na broad range.\nThis context is not a context that involves the use of race \nto decide who will receive goods or services that are nor-\nmally distributed on the basis of merit and which are in\nshort supply.  It is not one in which race-conscious limits \nstigmatize or exclude; the limits at issue do not pit the\nraces against each other or otherwise significantly exacer-\nbate racial tensions.  They do not impose burdens unfairly\nupon members of one race alone but instead seek benefits\nfor members of all races alike.  The context here is one of \nracial limits that seek, not to keep the races apart, but to\nbring them together.\nThe importance of these differences is clear once one\ncompares  the  present  circumstances  with  other  cases \nwhere one or more of these negative features are present. \nSee, e.g., Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880); \nYick  Wo  v.  Hopkins,  118  U. S.  356  (1886);  Brown,  347 \nU. S. 483; Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); Regents of \nUniv. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.

S. 499 (2005).\nIf one examines the context more specifically, one finds \nthat the districts’ plans reflect efforts to overcome a his-\ntory of segregation, embody the results of broad experience\nand  community  consultation,  seek  to  expand  student\nchoice while reducing the need for mandatory busing, and\nuse  race-conscious  criteria  in  highly  limited  ways  that \n\nCite as: 551 U.

They\ndo not seek to award a scarce commodity on the basis of \nmerit, for they are not magnet schools; rather, by design\nand in practice, they offer substantially equivalent aca-\ndemic programs and electives.  Although some parents or\nchildren prefer some schools over others, school popularity \nhas varied significantly over the years.  In 2000, for exam-\nple,  Roosevelt  was  the  most  popular  first  choice  high\nschool in Seattle; in 2001, Ballard was the most popular; \nin 2000, West Seattle was one of the least popular; by \n2003,  it  was  one  of  the  more  popular.

In a word, the school plans under review do not \ninvolve  the  kind  of  race-based  harm  that  has  led  this \nCourt, in other contexts, to find the use of race-conscious \ncriteria unconstitutional. \nThese and related considerations convinced one Ninth \nCircuit judge in the Seattle case to apply a standard of\nconstitutionality review that is less than “strict,” and to\nconclude that this Court’s precedents do not require the \ncontrary.  See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193–1194 (2005) (Kozinski, \nJ., concurring) (“That a student is denied the school of his \nchoice  may  be  disappointing,  but  it  carries  no  racial\nstigma  and  says  nothing  at  all  about  that  individual’s\naptitude or ability”).

J. 420, 433–434 (1988). \nThe  view  that  a  more  lenient  standard  than  “strict \nscrutiny” should apply in the present context would not \nimply abandonment of judicial efforts carefully to deter-\n\n36  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nmine the need for race-conscious criteria and the criteria’s \ntailoring in light of the need.  And the present context\nrequires a court to examine carefully the race-conscious \nprogram at issue.  In doing so, a reviewing judge must be\nfully  aware  of  the  potential  dangers  and  pitfalls  that \nJUSTICE  THOMAS  and  JUSTICE  KENNEDY  mention.  See \nante,  at  11–12  (THOMAS,  J.,  concurring); ante,  at  3,  17 \n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\nBut unlike the plurality, such a judge would also be \naware  that  a  legislature  or  school  administrators,  ulti-\nmately  accountable  to  the  electorate,  could  nonetheless \nproperly conclude that a racial classification sometimes \nserves a purpose important enough to overcome the risks \nthey mention, for example, helping to end racial isolation \nor to achieve a diverse student body in public schools.  Cf. \nante, at 17–18 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Where that is so, \nthe judge would carefully examine the program’s details to \ndetermine  whether  the  use  of  race-conscious  criteria  is \nproportionate to the important ends it serves.\nIn  my  view,  this  contextual  approach  to  scrutiny  is\naltogether fitting.  I believe that the law requires applica-\ntion here of a standard of review that is not “strict” in the \ntraditional sense of that word, although it does require the\ncareful review I have just described.  See Gratz, supra, at \n301  (GINSBURG,  J.,  joined  by  SOUTER,  J.,  dissenting); \nAdarand,  supra,  at  242–249  (STEVENS,  J.,  joined  by\nGINSBURG, J., dissenting); 426 F. 3d, at 1193–1194 (Koz-\ninski, J., concurring).  Apparently JUSTICE KENNEDY also \nagrees that strict scrutiny would not apply in respect to\ncertain “race-conscious” school board policies.  See ante, at \n9 (“Executive and legislative branches, which for genera-\ntions  now  have  considered  these  types  of  policies  and \nprocedures,  should  be  permitted  to  employ  them  with \ncandor and with confidence that a constitutional violation \ndoes not occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the \nimpact a given approach might have on students of differ-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  37 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nent races”).\nNonetheless, in light of Grutter and other precedents, \nsee, e.g., Bakke, 438 U. S., at 290 (opinion of Powell, J.), I \nshall adopt the first alternative.  I shall apply the version\nof strict scrutiny that those cases embody.  I shall conse-\nquently  ask  whether  the  school  boards  in  Seattle  and \nLouisville  adopted  these  plans  to  serve  a  “compelling\ngovernmental interest” and, if so, whether the plans are \n“narrowly tailored” to achieve that interest.  If the plans\nsurvive this strict review, they would survive less exacting\nreview a fortiori.  Hence, I conclude that the plans before \nus  pass  both  parts  of  the  strict  scrutiny  test.    Conse-\nquently I must conclude that the plans here are permitted \nunder the Constitution. \nIII \nApplying the Legal Standard \nA \nCompelling Interest \nThe principal interest advanced in these cases to justify\nthe  use  of  race-based  criteria  goes  by  various  names. \nSometimes a court refers to it as an interest in achieving \nracial “diversity.”  Other times a court, like the plurality\nhere, refers to it as an interest in racial “balancing.”  I \nhave  used  more  general  terms  to  signify  that  interest, \ndescribing it, for example, as an interest in promoting or \npreserving greater racial “integration” of public schools.\nBy this term, I mean the school districts’ interest in elimi-\nnating school-by-school racial isolation and increasing the \ndegree to which racial mixture characterizes each of the \ndistrict’s  schools  and  each  individual  student’s  public \nschool experience. \nRegardless of its name, however, the interest at stake\npossesses three essential elements.  First, there is a his-\ntorical and remedial element: an interest in setting right\nthe consequences of prior conditions of segregation.  This \n\n38  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nrefers  back  to  a  time  when  public  schools  were  highly\nsegregated,  often  as  a  result  of  legal  or  administrative\npolicies  that  facilitated  racial  segregation  in  public\nschools.    It  is  an  interest  in  continuing  to  combat  the\nremnants of segregation caused in whole or in part by\nthese school-related policies, which have often affected not \nonly schools, but also housing patterns, employment prac-\ntices, economic conditions, and social attitudes.  It is an \ninterest in maintaining hard-won gains.  And it has its \nroots in preventing what gradually may become the de \nfacto resegregation of America’s public schools.  See Part I, \nsupra, at 4; Appendix A, infra.  See also ante, at 17 (opin-\nion of KENNEDY, J.) (“This Nation has a moral and ethical \nobligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an\nintegrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of\nits children”).\nSecond, there is an educational element: an interest in \novercoming the adverse educational effects produced by \nand associated with highly segregated schools.  Cf. Grut-\nter, 539 U. S., at 345 (GINSBURG, J., concurring).  Studies \nsuggest that children taken from those schools and placed \nin integrated settings often show positive academic gains.\nSee, e.g., Powell, Living and Learning: Linking Housing \nand Education, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking \nHousing and Education Policy 15, 35 (J. Powell, G. Kear-\nney, & V. Kay eds. 2001) (hereinafter Powell); Hallinan, \nDiversity  Effects  on  Student  Outcomes:  Social  Science\nEvidence, 59 Ohio St. L. J. 733, 741–742 (1998) (hereinaf-\nter Hallinan).\nOther studies reach different conclusions.  See, e.g., D. \nArmor, Forced Justice (1995).  See also ante, at 15–17 \n(THOMAS, J., concurring).  But the evidence supporting an\neducational interest in racially integrated schools is well \nestablished and strong enough to permit a democratically\nelected  school  board  reasonably  to  determine  that  this\ninterest is a compelling one. \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  39 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nResearch  suggests,  for  example,  that  black  children\nfrom  segregated  educational  environments  significantly \nincrease their achievement levels once they are placed in a \nmore integrated setting.  Indeed in Louisville itself the \nachievement  gap  between  black  and  white  elementary \nschool  students  grew  substantially  smaller  (by  seven \npercentage points) after the integration plan was imple-\nmented in 1975.  See Powell 35.  Conversely, to take an-\nother example, evidence from a district in Norfolk, Vir-\nginia, shows that resegregated schools led to a decline in \nthe achievement test scores of children of all races.  Ibid. \nOne commentator, reviewing dozens of studies of the \neducational benefits of desegregated schooling, found that \nthe studies have provided “remarkably consistent” results,\nshowing that: (1) black students’ educational achievement \nis improved in integrated schools as compared to racially\nisolated schools, (2) black students’ educational achieve-\nment is improved in integrated classes, and (3) the earlier \nthat black students are removed from racial isolation, the \nbetter their educational outcomes.  See Hallinan 741–742. \nMultiple studies also indicate that black alumni of inte-\ngrated schools are more likely to move into occupations \ntraditionally  closed  to  African-Americans,  and  to  earn\nmore money in those fields.  See, e.g., Schofield, Review of \nResearch on School Desegregation’s Impact on Elementary\nand Secondary School Students, in Handbook of Research\non Multicultural Education 597, 606–607 (J. Banks & C. \nBanks eds. 1995).  Cf. W. Bowen & D. Bok, The Shape of \nthe River 118 (1998) (hereinafter Bowen & Bok).\nThird,  there  is  a  democratic  element:  an  interest  in \nproducing  an  educational  environment  that  reflects  the\n“pluralistic  society”  in  which  our  children  will  live. \nSwann, 402 U. S., at 16.  It is an interest in helping our\nchildren learn to work and play together with children of\ndifferent racial backgrounds.  It is an interest in teaching\nchildren  to  engage  in  the  kind  of  cooperation  among \n\n40  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nAmericans of all races that is necessary to make a land of \nthree hundred million people one Nation. \nAgain, data support this insight.  See, e.g., Hallinan 745; \nQuillian & Campbell, Beyond Black and White: The Pre-\nsent and Future of Multiracial Friendship Segregation, 68 \nAm. Sociological Rev. 540, 541 (2003) (hereinafter Quillian\n& Campbell); Dawkins & Braddock, The Continuing Sig-\nnificance of Desegregation: School Racial Composition and \nAfrican  American  Inclusion  in  American  Society,  63  J. \nNegro Ed. 394, 401–403 (1994) (hereinafter Dawkins & \nBraddock); Wells & Crain, Perpetuation Theory and the \nLong-Term Effects of School Desegregation, 64 Rev. Edu-\ncational  Research  531,  550  (1994)  (hereinafter  Wells  & \nCrain).\nThere are again studies that offer contrary conclusions.\nSee, e.g., Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup\nRelations, in 17 Review of Research in Education 356 (G. \nGrant ed. 1991).  See also ante, at 22–23 (THOMAS, J., \nconcurring).  Again, however, the evidence supporting a\ndemocratic interest in racially integrated schools is firmly\nestablished  and  sufficiently  strong  to  permit  a  school\nboard to determine, as this Court has itself often found, \nthat this interest is compelling.\nFor  example,  one  study  documented  that  “black  and\nwhite students in desegregated schools are less racially\nprejudiced  than  those  in  segregated  schools,”  and  that \n“interracial  contact  in  desegregated  schools leads  to  an \nincrease in interracial sociability and friendship.”  Hal-\nlinan 745.  See also Quillian & Campbell 541.  Cf. Bowen \n& Bok 155.  Other studies have found that both black and \nwhite students who attend integrated schools are more\nlikely to work in desegregated companies after graduation \nthan  students  who  attended  racially  isolated  schools.\nDawkins & Braddock 401–403; Wells & Crain 550.  Fur-\nther research has shown that the desegregation of schools \ncan help bring adult communities together by reducing \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  41 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nsegregated housing.  Cities that have implemented suc-\ncessful  school  desegregation  plans  have  witnessed  in-\ncreased interracial contact and neighborhoods that tend to\nbecome  less  racially  segregated.    Dawkins  &  Braddock \n403.  These effects not only reinforce the prior gains of\nintegrated  primary  and  secondary  education;  they  also\nforesee  a  time  when  there  is  less  need  to  use  race-\nconscious criteria. \nMoreover, this Court from Swann to Grutter has treated \nthese civic effects as an important virtue of racially di-\nverse education.  See, e.g., Swann, supra, at 16; Seattle \nSchool Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S., at 472–473.  In Grutter, in \nthe context of law school admissions, we found that these \ntypes of interests were, constitutionally speaking, “compel-\nling.”  See 539 U. S., at 330 (recognizing that Michigan\nLaw School’s race-conscious admissions policy “promotes \ncross-racial  understanding,  helps  to  break  down  racial\nstereotypes, and enables [students] to better understand \npersons  of  different  races,”  and  pointing  out  that  “the \nskills needed in today’s increasingly global marketplace\ncan only be developed through exposure to widely diverse \npeople, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints” (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted; alteration in original)).\nIn light of this Court’s conclusions in Grutter, the “com-\npelling” nature of these interests in the context of primary \nand  secondary  public  education  follows  here  a  fortiori. \nPrimary and secondary schools are where the education of \nthis Nation’s children begins, where each of us begins to\nabsorb those values we carry with us to the end of our \ndays.  As Justice Marshall said, “unless our children begin \nto learn together, there is little hope that our people will\never learn to live together.”  Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. \n717, 783 (1974) (dissenting opinion).   \nAnd it was Brown, after all, focusing upon primary and \nsecondary schools, not Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629 \n(1950), focusing on law schools, or McLaurin v. Oklahoma \n\n42  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Kluger, Simple Justice: The \nHistory of Brown v. Board of Education and Black Amer-\nica’s Struggle for Equality, p. x (1975) (arguing that per-\nhaps  no  other  Supreme  Court  case  has  “affected  more \ndirectly  the  minds,  hearts,  and  daily  lives  of  so  many\nAmericans”);  Patterson,  Brown  v.  Board  of  Education \nxxvii  (2001)  (identifying  Brown  as  “the  most  eagerly\nawaited and dramatic judicial decision of modern times”).\nSee also Parents Involved VII, 426 F. 3d, at 1194 (Kozin-\nski,  J.,  concurring);  Strauss,  Discriminatory  Intent  and \nthe Taming of Brown, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 935, 937 (1989) \n(calling  Brown  “the  Supreme  Court’s  greatest  anti-\ndiscrimination  decision”);  Brief  for  United  States  as \nAmicus Curiae in Brown, 347 U. S. 483; Dudziak, Brown \nas a Cold War Case, 91 J. Am.

Hence, I am not surprised \nthat JUSTICE KENNEDY finds that, “a district may consider\nit a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student popu-\nlation,” including a racially diverse population.  Ante, at \n17–18. \nThe compelling interest at issue here, then, includes an\neffort to eradicate the remnants, not of general “societal \ndiscrimination,”  ante,  at  23  (plurality  opinion),  but  of \nprimary and secondary school segregation, see supra, at 7, \n14; it includes an effort to create school environments that \nprovide better educational opportunities for all children; it \nincludes an effort to help create citizens better prepared to\nknow, to understand, and to work with people of all races \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  43 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nand backgrounds, thereby furthering the kind of democ-\nratic government our Constitution foresees.  If an educa-\ntional interest that combines these three elements is not \n“compelling,” what is?\nThe  majority  acknowledges  that  in  prior  cases  this \nCourt has recognized at least two interests as compelling:\nan interest in “remedying the effects of past intentional\ndiscrimination,”  and  an  interest  in  “diversity  in  higher\neducation.”  Ante, at 12, 13.  But the plurality does not \nconvincingly explain why those interests do not constitute\na “compelling interest” here.  How do the remedial inter-\nests here differ in kind from those at issue in the volun-\ntary desegregation efforts that Attorney General Kennedy\nmany years ago described in his letter to the President? \nSupra, at 19–20.  How do the educational and civic inter-\nests differ in kind from those that underlie and justify the\nracial “diversity” that the law school sought in Grutter, \nwhere this Court found a compelling interest?  \nThe plurality tries to draw a distinction by reference to \nthe well-established conceptual difference between de jure \nsegregation  (“segregation  by  state  action”)  and de  facto \nsegregation (“racial imbalance caused by other factors”). \nAnte, at 28.  But that distinction concerns what the Con-\nstitution requires school boards to do, not what it permits\nthem to do.  Compare, e.g., Green, 391 U.  S., at 437–438 \n(“School  boards  . . .  operating  state-compelled  dual  sys-\ntems” have an “affirmative duty to take whatever steps\nmight  be  necessary  to  convert  to  a  unitary  system  in\nwhich racial discrimination would be eliminated root and \nbranch”), with, e.g., Milliken, 418 U.  S., at 745 (the Con-\nstitution  does  not  impose  a  duty  to  desegregate  upon\ndistricts that have not been “shown to have committed any \nconstitutional violation”).   \nThe opinions cited by the plurality to justify its reliance\nupon the de jure/de facto distinction only address what\nremedial measures a school district may be constitution-\n\n44  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nally required to undertake.  See, e.g., Freeman v. Pitts, 503 \nU. S. 467, 495 (1992).  As to what is permitted, nothing in\nour equal protection law suggests that a State may right \nonly those wrongs that it committed.  No case of this Court \nhas ever relied upon the de jure/de facto distinction in \norder to limit what a school district is voluntarily allowed \nto do.  That is what is at issue here.  And Swann, McDan-\niel,  Crawford,  North  Carolina  Bd.  of  Ed.,  Harris,  and \nBustop made one thing clear: significant as the difference\nbetween de jure and de facto segregation may be to the \nquestion of what a school district must do, that distinction \nis not germane to the question of what a school district \nmay do. \nNor does any precedent indicate, as the plurality sug-\ngests with respect to Louisville, ante, at 29, that remedial \ninterests vanish the day after a federal court declares that\na district is “unitary.”  Of course, Louisville adopted those \nportions of the plan at issue here before a court declared \nLouisville “unitary.”  Moreover, in Freeman, this Court \npointed out that in “one sense of the term, vestiges of past \nsegregation by state decree do remain in our society and in\nour schools.  Past wrongs to the black race, wrongs com-\nmitted by the State and in its name, are a stubborn fact of\nhistory.  And stubborn facts of history linger and persist.” \n503  U. S.,  at  495.    See  also  ante,  at  15  (opinion  of \nKENNEDY, J.).  I do not understand why this Court’s cases, \nwhich rest the significance of a “unitary” finding in part\nupon the wisdom and desirability of returning schools to \nlocal control, should deprive those local officials of legal \npermission  to  use  means  they  once  found  necessary  to \ncombat persisting injustices.\nFor  his  part,  JUSTICE  THOMAS  faults  my  citation  of \nvarious studies supporting the view that school districts\ncan  find  compelling  educational  and  civic  interests  in\nintegrating their public schools.  See ante, at 15–17, 23 \n(concurring opinion).  He is entitled of course to his own \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  45 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nopinion as to which studies he finds convincing—although \nit bears mention that even the author of some of JUSTICE \nTHOMAS’ preferred studies has found some evidence link-\ning  integrated  learning  environments  to  increased  aca-\ndemic  achievement.  Cf.  ante,  at  15–17  (opinion  of \nTHOMAS, J.) (citing Armor & Rossell, Desegregation and \nResegregation in the Public Schools, in Beyond the Color \nLine  239  (A.  Thernstrom  &  S.  Thernstrom  eds.  2002); \nBrief for Armor et al. as Amici Curiae, with Rosen, Per-\nhaps Not All Affirmative Action is Created Equal, N. Y. \nTimes, June 11, 2006 (quoting David Armor as comment-\ning “‘[w]e did find the [racial] achievement gap changing \nsignificantly’”  and  acknowledging  that  he  “‘did  find  a\nmodest association for math but not reading in terms of\nracial composition and achievement, but there’s a big state\nvariation’” (emphasis added)).  If we are to insist upon\nunanimity in the social science literature before finding a\ncompelling interest, we might never find one.  I believe \nonly that the Constitution allows democratically elected \nschool boards to make up their own minds as to how best \nto include people of all races in one America. \nB \nNarrow Tailoring \nI next ask whether the plans before us are “narrowly \ntailored” to achieve these “compelling” objectives.  I shall \nnot accept the school board’s assurances on faith, cf. Miller \nv. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 920 (1995), and I shall subject \nthe “tailoring” of their plans to “rigorous judicial review.” \nGrutter,  539  U. S.,  at  388  (KENNEDY,  J.,  dissenting).\nSeveral  factors,  taken  together,  nonetheless  lead  me  to \nconclude that the boards’ use of race-conscious criteria in \nthese plans passes even the strictest “tailoring” test. \nFirst, the race-conscious criteria at issue only help set\nthe  outer  bounds  of  broad  ranges.  Cf.  id.,  at  390 \n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (expressing concern about “nar-\n\n46  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nrow fluctuation band[s]”).  They constitute but one part of \nplans  that  depend  primarily  upon  other,  nonracial  ele-\nments.  To use race in this way is not to set a forbidden \n“quota.”  See id., at 335 (“Properly understood, a ‘quota’ is\na program in which a certain fixed number or proportion\nof opportunities are ‘reserved exclusively for certain mi-\nnority groups’” (quoting Croson, 488 U. S., at 496)). \nIn  fact,  the  defining  feature  of  both  plans  is  greater \nemphasis upon student choice.  In Seattle, for example, in\nmore than 80% of all cases, that choice alone determines \nwhich  high  schools  Seattle’s  ninth  graders  will  attend. \nAfter  ninth  grade,  students  can  decide  voluntarily  to\ntransfer to a preferred district high school (without any\nconsideration of race-conscious criteria).  Choice, therefore, \nis the “predominant factor” in these plans.  Race is not. \nSee Grutter, supra, at 393 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (al-\nlowing consideration of race only if it does “not become a\npredominant factor”).\nIndeed, the race-conscious ranges at issue in these cases\noften have no effect, either because the particular school is \nnot oversubscribed in the year in question, or because the \nracial makeup of the school falls within the broad range, \nor because the student is a transfer applicant or has a \nsibling at the school.  In these respects, the broad ranges \nare less like a quota and more like the kinds of “useful \nstarting  points”  that  this  Court  has  consistently  found\npermissible, even when they set boundaries upon volun-\ntary  transfers,  and  even  when  they  are  based  upon  a\ncommunity’s general population.  See, e.g., North Carolina \nBd. of Ed. v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43, 46 (1971) (no “absolute\nprohibition against [the] use” of mathematical ratios as a\n“starting point”); Swann, 402 U. S., at 24–25 (approving \nthe use of a ratio reflecting “the racial composition of the\nwhole school system” as a “useful starting point,” but not\nas an “inflexible requirement”).  Cf. United States v. Mont-\ngomery County Bd. of Ed., 395 U. S. 225, 232 (1969) (ap-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  47 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nproving a lower court desegregation order that “provided\nthat the [school] board must move toward a goal under \nwhich ‘in each school the ratio of white to Negro faculty\nmembers is substantially the same as it is throughout the \nsystem,’” and “immediately” requiring “[t]he ratio of Negro \nto white teachers” in each school to be equal to “the ratio\nof Negro to white teachers in . . . the system as a whole”). \nSecond, broad-range limits on voluntary school choice \nplans  are  less  burdensome,  and  hence  more  narrowly \ntailored,  see  Grutter,  supra,  at  341,  than  other  race-\nconscious restrictions this Court has previously approved. \nSee, e.g., Swann, supra, at 26–27; Montgomery Co. Bd. of \nEd., supra, at 232.  Indeed, the plans before us are more \nnarrowly tailored than the race-conscious admission plans\nthat this Court approved in Grutter.  Here, race becomes a \nfactor  only  in  a  fraction  of  students’  non-merit-based\nassignments—not  in  large  numbers  of  students’  merit-\nbased applications.  Moreover, the effect of applying race-\nconscious criteria here affects potentially disadvantaged\nstudents less severely, not more severely, than the criteria \nat issue in Grutter.  Disappointed students are not rejected\nfrom  a  State’s  flagship  graduate  program;  they  simply\nattend a different one of the district’s many public schools,\nwhich in aspiration and in fact are substantially equal. \nCf. Wygant, 476 U. S., at 283.  And, in Seattle, the disad-\nvantaged student loses at most one year at the high school \nof his choice.  One will search Grutter in vain for similarly \npersuasive  evidence  of  narrow  tailoring  as  the  school\ndistricts have presented here. \nThird, the manner in which the school boards developed \nthese plans itself reflects “narrow tailoring.”  Each plan\nwas devised to overcome a history of segregated public \nschools.  Each plan embodies the results of local experi-\nence and community consultation.  Each plan is the prod-\nuct of a process that has sought to enhance student choice, \nwhile diminishing the need for mandatory busing.  And \n\n48  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\neach plan’s use of race-conscious elements is diminished \ncompared to the use of race in preceding integration plans. \nThe  school  boards’  widespread  consultation,  their  ex-\nperimentation with numerous other plans, indeed, the 40-\nyear history that Part I sets forth, make clear that plans \nthat are less explicitly race-based are unlikely to achieve\nthe board’s “compelling” objectives.  The history of each\nschool system reveals highly segregated schools, followed\nby remedial plans that involved forced busing, followed by \nefforts to attract or retain students through the use of \nplans that abandoned busing and replaced it with greater \nstudent  choice.  Both  cities  once  tried  to  achieve  more \nintegrated schools by relying solely upon measures such as \nredrawn district boundaries, new school building construc-\ntion, and unrestricted voluntary transfers.  In neither city\ndid these prior attempts prove sufficient to achieve the\ncity’s integration goals.  See Parts I–A and I–B, supra, at \n6–18. \nMoreover, giving some degree of weight to a local school \nboard’s knowledge, expertise, and concerns in these par-\nticular matters is not inconsistent with rigorous judicial\nscrutiny.  It simply recognizes that judges are not well \nsuited  to  act  as  school  administrators.  Indeed,  in  the \ncontext of school desegregation, this Court has repeatedly \nstressed the importance of acknowledging that local school \nboards better understand their own communities and have \na better knowledge of what in practice will best meet the \neducational needs of their pupils.  See Milliken, 418 U. S., \nat 741–42 (“No single tradition in public education is more \ndeeply  rooted  than  local  control  over  the  operation  of \nschools; local autonomy has long been thought essential \nboth to the maintenance of community concern and sup-\nport for public schools and to quality of the educational \nprocess”).  See also San Antonio Independent School Dist. \nv. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 49–50 (1973) (extolling local \ncontrol for “the opportunity it offers for participation in \n\nCite as: 551 U.

In 1987, the U. S. Commission on \nCivil  Rights  studied  125  large  school  districts  seeking\nintegration.  It reported that most districts—92 of them, in \nfact—adopted desegregation policies that combined two or\nmore highly race-conscious strategies, for example, rezon-\ning or pairing.  See Welch 83–91. \nHaving looked at dozens of amicus briefs, public reports, \nnews stories, and the records in many of this Court’s prior\ncases,  which  together  span  50  years  of  desegregation\nhistory in school districts across the Nation, I have discov-\nered many examples of districts that sought integration\nthrough explicitly race-conscious methods, including man-\ndatory busing.  Yet, I have found no example or model that \nwould permit this Court to say to Seattle and to Louisville:\n“Here is an instance of a desegregation plan that is likely \nto achieve your objectives and also makes less use of race-\nconscious criteria than your plans.”  And, if the plurality \n\n50  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\ncannot suggest such a model—and it cannot—then it seeks\nto impose a “narrow tailoring” requirement that in prac-\ntice would never be met. \nIndeed, if there is no such plan, or if such plans are\npurely imagined, it is understandable why, as the plural-\nity notes, ante, at 27, Seattle school officials concentrated \non  diminishing  the  racial  component  of  their  districts’ \nplan, but did not pursue eliminating that element entirely. \nFor the plurality now to insist as it does, ante, at 27–28, \nthat these school districts ought to have said so officially is \neither to ask for the superfluous (if they need only make\nexplicit what is implicit) or to demand the impossible (if \nthey must somehow provide more proof that there is no \nhypothetical other plan that could work as well as theirs). \nI am not aware of any case in which this Court has read\nthe “narrow tailoring” test to impose such a requirement.\nCf. People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Ed. School Dist. \nNo. 205, 961 F. 2d 1335, 1338 (CA7 1992) (Easterbrook, J.) \n(“Would  it  be  necessary  to  adjudicate  the  obvious \nbefore adopting (or permitting the parties to agree on) a \nremedy . . . ?”).\nThe plurality also points to the school districts’ use of\nnumerical goals based upon the racial breakdown of the \ngeneral school population, and it faults the districts for\nfailing to prove that no other set of numbers will work.  See \nante, at 18–20.  The plurality refers to no case in support \nof its demand.  Nor is it likely to find such a case.  After \nall,  this  Court  has  in  many  cases  explicitly  permitted\ndistricts  to  use  target  ratios  based  upon  the  district’s \nunderlying population.  See, e.g., Swann, 402 U. S., at 24– \n25; North Carolina Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S., at 46; Montgom-\nery County Bd. of Ed., 395 U. S., at 232.  The reason is \nobvious: In Seattle, where the overall student population \nis 41% white, permitting 85% white enrollment at a single\nschool would make it much more likely that other schools \nwould have very few white students, whereas in Jefferson \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  51 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nCounty, with a 60% white enrollment, one school with 85% \nwhite students would be less likely to skew enrollments \nelsewhere. \nMoreover, there is research-based evidence supporting,\nfor example, that a ratio no greater than 50% minority—\nwhich is Louisville’s starting point, and as close as feasible \nto Seattle’s starting point—is helpful in limiting the risk of \n“white flight.”  See Orfield, Metropolitan School Desegre-\ngation: Impacts on Metropolitan Society, in Pursuit of a\nDream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy \n121, 125.  Federal law also assumes that a similar target \npercentage  will  help  avoid  detrimental  “minority  group \nisolation.”  See No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Title V, \nPart C, 115 Stat. 1806, 20 U. S. C. §7231 et seq. (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV); 34 CFR §§280.2, 280.4 (2006) (implementing \nregulations).  What other numbers are the boards to use \nas a “starting point”?  Are they to spend days, weeks, or \nmonths seeking independently to validate the use of ratios \nthat this Court has repeatedly authorized in prior cases? \nAre they to draw numbers out of thin air?  These districts \nhave followed this Court’s holdings and advice in “tailor-\ning” their plans.  That, too, strongly supports the lawful-\nness of their methods. \nNor could the school districts have accomplished their\ndesired  aims  (e.g.,  avoiding  forced  busing,  countering \nwhite flight, maintaining racial diversity) by other means.\nNothing in the extensive history of desegregation efforts \nover the past 50 years gives the districts, or this Court, \nany reason to believe that another method is possible to \naccomplish these goals.  Nevertheless, JUSTICE KENNEDY \nsuggests that school boards: \n“may pursue the goal of bringing together students of \ndiverse backgrounds and races through other means,\nincluding strategic site selection of new schools; draw-\ning attendance zones with general recognition of the \n\n52  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\ndemographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources \nfor special programs; recruiting students and faculty\nin a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, per-\nformance, and other statistics by race.” Ante, at 8. \nBut, as to “strategic site selection,” Seattle has built one \nnew high school in the last 44 years (and that specialized \nschool serves only 300 students).  In fact, six of the Seattle \nhigh schools involved in this case were built by the 1920’s; \nthe other four were open by the early 1960’s.  See gener-\nally N. Thompson & C. Marr, Building for Learning: Seat-\ntle  Public  Schools  Histories,  1862–2000  (2002).    As  to \n“drawing”  neighborhood  “attendance  zones”  on  a  racial \nbasis, Louisville tried it, and it worked only when forced \nbusing was also part of the plan.  See supra, at 12–14.  As \nto “allocating resources for special programs,” Seattle and \nLouisville have both experimented with this; indeed, these \nprograms are often referred to as “magnet schools,” but\nthe limited desegregation effect of these efforts extends at\nmost to those few schools to which additional resources are \ngranted.  In addition, there is no evidence from the experi-\nence of these school districts that it will make any mean-\ningful impact.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 05–908, p. \n42.  As to “recruiting faculty” on the basis of race, both\ncities have tried, but only as one part of a broader pro-\ngram.  As to “tracking enrollments, performance and other \nstatistics by race,” tracking reveals the problem; it does \nnot cure it.\n JUSTICE  KENNEDY  sets  forth  two  additional  concerns \nrelated to “narrow tailoring.”  In respect to Louisville, he \nsays first that officials stated (1) that kindergarten as-\nsignments are not subject to the race-conscious guidelines, \nand (2) that the child at issue here was denied permission\nto attend the kindergarten he wanted because of those \nguidelines.  Both, he explains, cannot be true.  He adds \nthat this confusion illustrates that Louisville’s assignment \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  53 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nplan (or its explanation of it to this Court) is insufficiently \nprecise  in  respect  to  “who  makes  the  decisions,”  “over-\nsight,” “the precise circumstances in which an assignment\ndecision” will be made; and “which of two similarly situ-\nated children will be subjected to a given race-based deci-\nsion.”  Ante, at 4. \nThe record suggests, however, that the child in question \nwas not assigned to the school he preferred because he\nmissed the kindergarten application deadline.  See App. in \n05–915, p. 20.  After he had enrolled and after the aca-\ndemic year had begun, he then applied to transfer to his \npreferred school after the kindergarten assignment dead-\nline had passed, id., at 21, possibly causing school officials\nto treat his late request as an application to transfer to the\nfirst grade, in respect to which the guidelines apply.  I am \nnot certain just how the remainder of JUSTICE KENNEDY’s \nconcerns affect the lawfulness of the Louisville program, \nfor they seem to be failures of explanation, not of admini-\nstration.  But  Louisville  should  be  able  to  answer  the \nrelevant questions on remand. \nJUSTICE KENNEDY’s second concern is directly related to \nthe merits of Seattle’s plan: Why does Seattle’s plan group \nAsian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Native-Americans,\nand  African-Americans  together,  treating  all  as  similar \nminorities?  Ante,  at  6–7.  The  majority  suggests  that\nSeattle’s classification system could permit a school to be \nlabeled  “diverse”  with  a  50%  Asian-American  and  50% \nwhite student body,  and no African-American students, \nHispanic students, or students of other ethnicity.  Ante, at \n6; ante, at 15–16 (opinion of the Court).   \nThe  50/50  hypothetical  has  no  support  in  the  record \nhere; it is conjured from the imagination.  In fact, Seattle \napparently began to treat these different minority groups\nalike  in  response  to  the  federal  Emergency  School  Aid \nAct’s requirement that it do so.  Siqueland 116–117.  See \nalso Hanawalt 31; Pub. L. 95–561, Tit. VI (1978) (prescrib-\n\n54  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\ning  percentage  enrollment  requirements  for  “minority”\nstudents);  Siqueland  55  (discussing  HEW  definition  of \n“minority”).  Moreover, maintaining this federally man-\ndated  system  of  classification  makes  sense  insofar  as \nSeattle’s  experience  indicates  that  the  relevant  circum-\nstances  in  respect  to  each  of  these  different  minority \ngroups are roughly similar, e.g., in terms of residential \npatterns, and call for roughly similar responses.  This is \nconfirmed by the fact that Seattle has been able to achieve \na desirable degree of diversity without the greater empha-\nsis on race that drawing fine lines among minority groups\nwould  require.  Does  the  plurality’s  view  of  the  Equal \nProtection Clause mean that courts must give no weight to \nsuch a board determination?  Does it insist upon especially \nstrong evidence supporting inclusion of multiple minority \ngroups  in  an  otherwise  lawful  government  minority-\nassistance program?  If so, its interpretation threatens to \nproduce divisiveness among minority groups that is in-\ncompatible  with  the  basic  objectives  of  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment.  Regardless, the plurality cannot object that\nthe constitutional defect is the individualized use of race \nand  simultaneously  object  that  not  enough  account  of\nindividuals’ race has been taken. \nFinally, I recognize that the Court seeks to distinguish \nGrutter from these cases by claiming that Grutter arose in \n“‘the context of higher education.’”  Ante, at 16.  But that \nis not a meaningful legal distinction.  I have explained \nwhy I do not believe the Constitution could possibly find\n“compelling” the provision of a racially diverse education\nfor a 23-year-old law student but not for a 13-year-old high\nschool pupil.  See supra, at 46–48.  And I have explained \nhow the plans before us are more narrowly tailored than\nthose in Grutter.  See supra, at 45.  I add that one cannot \nfind a relevant distinction in the fact that these school \ndistricts did not examine the merits of applications “indi-\nvidual[ly].”  See ante, at 13–15.  The context here does not \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  55 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \ninvolve admission by merit; a child’s academic, artistic, \nand athletic “merits” are not at all relevant to the child’s \nplacement.  These are not affirmative action plans, and \nhence “individualized scrutiny” is simply beside the point.\nThe  upshot  is  that  these  plans’  specific  features—(1)\ntheir limited and historically-diminishing use of race, (2) \ntheir strong reliance upon other non-race-conscious ele-\nments,  (3)  their  history  and  the  manner  in  which  the\ndistricts developed and modified their approach, (4) the \ncomparison with prior plans, and (5) the lack of reasonably\nevident  alternatives—together  show  that  the  districts’ \nplans are “narrowly tailored” to achieve their “compelling” \ngoals.  In sum, the districts’ race-conscious plans satisfy\n“strict scrutiny” and are therefore lawful. \nIV \nDirect Precedent \nTwo additional precedents more directly related to the\nplans  here  at  issue  reinforce  my  conclusion.  The  first \nconsists of the District Court determination in the Louis-\nville case when it dissolved its desegregation order that\nthere  was  “overwhelming  evidence  of  the  Board’s  good \nfaith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its\nunderlying purposes,” indeed that the Board had “treated\nthe ideal of an integrated system as much more than a\nlegal  obligation—they  consider  it  a  positive,  desirable\npolicy and an essential element of any well-rounded public \nschool education.”  Hampton II, 102 F. Supp. 2d, at 370. \nWhen the court made this determination in 2000, it did so \nin the context of the Louisville desegregation plan that the\nboard had adopted in 1996.  That plan, which took effect\nbefore 1996, is the very plan that in all relevant respects is\nin effect now and is the subject of the present challenge. \nNo one claims that (the relevant portion of) Louisville’s\nplan was unlawful in 1996 when Louisville adopted it.  To \nthe contrary, there is every reason to believe that it repre-\n\n56  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nsented part of an effort to implement the 1978 desegrega-\ntion order.  But if the plan was lawful when it was first\nadopted and if it was lawful the day before the District\nCourt dissolved its order, how can the plurality now sug-\ngest  that  it  became  unlawful  the  following  day?    Is  it \nconceivable that the Constitution, implemented through a \ncourt desegregation order, could permit (perhaps require)\nthe district to make use of a race-conscious plan the day\nbefore the order was dissolved and then forbid the district \nto use the identical plan the day after?  See id., at 380 \n(“The very analysis for dissolving desegregation decrees \nsupports continued maintenance of a desegregated system\nas  a  compelling  state  interest”).  The  Equal  Protection\nClause is not incoherent.  And federal courts would rightly\nhesitate to find unitary status if the consequences of the \nruling were so dramatically disruptive. \nSecond,  Seattle  School  Dist.  No.  1,  458  U. S.  457,  is \ndirectly on point.  That case involves the original Seattle \nPlan, a more heavily race-conscious predecessor of the very\nplan now before us.  In Seattle School Dist. No. 1, this \nCourt  struck  down  a  state  referendum  that  effectively \nbarred implementation of Seattle’s desegregation plan and \n“burden[ed] all future attempts to integrate Washington \nschools in districts throughout the State.”  Id., at 462–463, \n483.  Because the referendum would have prohibited the\nadoption of a school-integration plan that involved manda-\ntory busing, and because it would have imposed a special\nburden on school integration plans (plans that sought to\nintegrate previously segregated schools), the Court found \nit unconstitutional.  Id., at 483–487. \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court did not directly\naddress the constitutional merits of the underlying Seattle\nplan.  But it explicitly cited Swann’s statement that the \nConstitution  permitted  a  local  district  to  adopt  such  a \nplan.  458 U. S., at 472, n. 15.  It also cited to Justice \nPowell’s opinion in Bakke, approving of the limited use of \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  57 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nrace-conscious  criteria  in  a  university-admissions  “af-\nfirmative action” case.  458 U. S., at 472, n. 15.  In addi-\ntion,  the  Court  stated  that  “[a]ttending  an  ethnically \ndiverse school,” id., at 473, could help prepare “minority\nchildren for citizenship in our pluralistic society,” hope-\nfully “teaching members of the racial majority to live in \nharmony  and  mutual  respect  with  children  of  minority\nheritage.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).\nIt is difficult to believe that the Court that held uncon-\nstitutional a referendum that would have interfered with \nthe implementation of this plan thought that the integra-\ntion plan it sought to preserve was itself an unconstitu-\ntional plan.  And if Seattle School Dist. No. 1 is premised\nupon the constitutionality of the original Seattle Plan, it is \nequally premised upon the constitutionality of the present \nplan, for the present plan is the Seattle Plan, modified \nonly  insofar  as  it  places  even  less  emphasis  on  race-\nconscious elements than its predecessors. \nIt is even more difficult to accept the plurality’s contrary\nview, namely that the underlying plan was unconstitu-\ntional.  If that is so, then all of Seattle’s earlier (even more\nrace-conscious)  plans  must  also  have  been  unconstitu-\ntional.  That necessary implication of the plurality’s posi-\ntion strikes the 13th chime of the clock.  How could the \nplurality adopt a constitutional standard that would hold \nunconstitutional large numbers of race-conscious integra-\ntion plans adopted by numerous school boards over the \npast 50 years while remaining true to this Court’s deseg-\nregation precedent? \nV \nConsequences \nThe  Founders  meant  the  Constitution  as  a  practical\ndocument that would transmit its basic values to future \ngenerations  through  principles  that  remained  workable \n\n58  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nover time.  Hence it is important to consider the potential \nconsequences  of  the  plurality’s  approach,  as  measured \nagainst the Constitution’s objectives.  To  do  so  provides\nfurther reason to believe that the plurality’s approach is\nlegally unsound.\nFor one thing, consider the effect of the plurality’s views \non the parties before us and on similar school districts\nthroughout the Nation.  Will Louisville and all similar \nschool districts have to return to systems like Louisville’s\ninitial 1956 plan, which did not consider race at all?  See \nsupra, at 12.  That initial 1956 plan proved ineffective. \nSixteen  years  into  the  plan,  14  of  19  middle  and  high\nschools remained almost totally white or almost totally \nblack.  Ibid. \nThe districts’ past and current plans are not unique. \nThey resemble other plans, promulgated by hundreds of \nlocal  school  boards,  which  have  attempted  a  variety  of\ndesegregation  methods  that  have  evolved  over  time  in \nlight  of  experience.  A  1987  Civil  Rights  Commission \nStudy of 125 school districts in the Nation demonstrated \nthe breadth and variety of desegregation plans: \n“The [study] documents almost 300 desegregation\nplans that were implemented between 1961 and 1985. \nThe degree of heterogeneity within these districts is\nimmediately apparent. They are located in every re-\ngion of the country and range in size from Las Cruces,\nNew Mexico, with barely over 15,000 students attend-\ning 23 schools in 1968, to New York City, with more \nthan one million students in 853 schools. The sample \nincludes districts in urban areas of all sizes, suburbs \n(e.g., Arlington County, Virginia) and rural areas (e.g., \nJefferson  Parish,  Louisiana,  and  Raleigh  County, \nWest  Virginia).  It  contains  34  countywide  districts \nwith central cities (the 11 Florida districts fit this de-\nscription, plus Clark County, Nevada and others) and \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  59 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \na small number of consolidated districts (New Castle\nCounty, Delaware and Jefferson County, Kentucky). \n“The districts also vary in their racial compositions \nand levels of segregation. Initial plans were imple-\nmented in Mobile, Alabama and Mecklenburg County, \nNorth Carolina, and in a number of other southern \ndistricts in the face of total racial segregation. At the \nother  extreme,  Santa  Clara,  California  had  a  rela-\ntively even racial distribution prior to its 1979 deseg-\nregation plan. When the 1965 plan was designed for\nHarford County, Maryland, the district was 92 per-\ncent white. Compton, California, on the other hand, \nbecame over 99 percent black in the 1980s, while Buf-\nfalo,  New  York  had  a  virtual  50–50  split  between \nwhite and minority students prior to its 1977 plan.\n“It is not surprising to find a large number of differ-\nent  desegregation  strategies  in  a  sample  with  this \nmuch variation.” Welch 23 (footnotes omitted). \nA  majority  of  these  desegregation  techniques  explicitly \nconsidered a student’s race.  See id., at 24–28.  Transfer \nplans, for example, allowed students to shift from a school\nin which they were in the racial majority to a school in \nwhich they would be in a racial minority.  Some districts, \nsuch  as  Richmond,  California,  and  Buffalo,  New  York, \npermitted only “one-way” transfers, in which only black \nstudents  attending  predominantly  black  schools  were\npermitted to transfer to designated receiver schools.  Id., \nat 25.  Fifty-three of the 125 studied districts used trans-\nfers as a component of their plans.  Id., at 83–91. \nAt  the  state  level,  46  States  and  Puerto  Rico  have \nadopted  policies  that  encourage  or  require  local  school \ndistricts to enact interdistrict or intradistrict open choice \nplans.

Code \nAnn. §3313.98(B)(2)(b)(iii) (Lexis Supp. 2006).  Ohio adds \nthat a “district may object to the enrollment of a native \nstudent in an adjacent or other district in order to main-\ntain an appropriate racial balance.”  §3313.98 (F)(1)(a). \nA  Connecticut  statute  states  that  its  student  choice \nprogram will seek to “preserve racial and ethnic balance.”\nConn. Gen. Stat. §10–266aa(b)(2) (2007).  Connecticut law \nrequires each school district to submit racial group popu-\nlation figures to the State Board of Education.  §10–226a. \nAnother Connecticut regulation provides that “[a]ny school \nin which the Proportion for the School falls outside of a \nrange  from  25  percentage  points  less  to  25  percentage \npoints  more  than  the  Comparable  Proportion  for  the\nSchool District, shall be determined to be racially imbal-\nanced.”  Conn.  Agencies  Regs.  §10–226e–3(b)  (1999).

The State Supreme Court wrote: “De-\nspite  the  initiatives  undertaken  by  the  defendants  to \nalleviate the severe racial and ethnic disparities among \nschool districts, and despite the fact that the defendants \ndid not intend to create or maintain these disparities, the \ndisparities that continue to burden the education of the \nplaintiffs infringe upon their fundamental state constitu-\ntional right to a substantially equal educational opportu-\nnity.”  Id., at 42, 678 A. 2d, at 1289. \nAt a minimum, the plurality’s views would threaten a \nsurge  of  race-based  litigation.  Hundreds  of  state  and \nfederal statutes and regulations use racial classifications\nfor educational or other purposes.  See supra, at 27.  In \nmany such instances, the contentious force of legal chal-\nlenges to these classifications, meritorious or not, would \ndisplace earlier calm.\nThe  wide  variety  of  different  integration  plans  that \nschool districts use throughout the Nation suggests that\nthe problem of racial segregation in schools, including de \nfacto segregation, is difficult to solve.  The fact that many \nsuch  plans  have  used  explicitly  racial  criteria  suggests\nthat such criteria have an important, sometimes neces-\nsary, role to play.  The fact that the controlling opinion \nwould make a school district’s use of such criteria often \nunlawful (and the plurality’s “colorblind” view would make\nsuch use always unlawful) suggests that today’s opinion \nwill require setting aside the laws of several States and \nmany local communities.\nAs I have pointed out, supra, at 4, de facto resegregation \nis on the rise.  See Appendix A, infra.  It is reasonable to \nconclude that such resegregation can create serious educa-\ntional, social, and civic problems.

NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\npresently at their disposal to combat those problems.  Yet \nthe plurality would deprive them of at least one tool that \nsome districts now consider vital—the limited use of broad \nrace-conscious student population ranges.\nI  use  the  words  “may  need”  here  deliberately.    The \nplurality, or at least those who follow JUSTICE THOMAS’ \n“‘color-blind’” approach, see ante, at 26–27 (THOMAS, J., \nconcurring); Grutter, 539 U. S., at 353–354 (THOMAS, J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part), may feel confi-\ndent that, to end invidious discrimination, one must end \nall governmental use of race-conscious criteria including \nthose with inclusive objectives.  See ante, at 40–41 (plural-\nity opinion); see also ante, at 26 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\nBy way of contrast, I do not claim to know how best to stop\nharmful discrimination; how best to create a society that \nincludes all Americans; how best to overcome our serious \nproblems of increasing de facto segregation, troubled inner\ncity schooling, and poverty correlated with race.  But, as a \njudge, I do know that the Constitution does not authorize \njudges to dictate solutions to these problems.  Rather, the \nConstitution creates a democratic political system through \nwhich the people themselves must together find answers. \nAnd it is for them to debate how best to educate the Na-\ntion’s  children  and  how  best  to  administer  America’s \nschools to achieve that aim.  The Court should leave them \nto their work.  And it is for them to decide, to quote the \nplurality’s slogan, whether the best “way to stop discrimi-\nnation on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the \nbasis of race.”  Ante, at 40–41.  See also Parents Involved \nVII, 426 F. 3d, at 1222 (Bea, J., dissenting) (“The way to \nend  racial  discrimination  is  to  stop  discriminating  by\nrace”).  That is why the Equal Protection Clause outlaws\ninvidious discrimination, but does not similarly forbid all \nuse of race-conscious criteria. \nUntil today, this Court understood the Constitution as \naffording the people, acting through their elected repre-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  63 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nsentatives, freedom to select the use of “race-conscious” \ncriteria from among their available options.  See Adarand \nConstructors, Inc., 515 U. S., at 237 (“[S]trict scrutiny” in\nthis context is “[not] ‘strict in theory, but fatal in fact’” \n(quoting Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J., concur-\nring in judgment))).  Today, however, the Court restricts \n(and some Members would eliminate) that leeway.  I fear \nthe consequences of doing so for the law, for the schools, \nfor the democratic process, and for America’s efforts to \ncreate, out of its diversity, one Nation. \nVI \nConclusions \nTo show that the school assignment plans here meet the \nrequirements of the Constitution, I have written at excep-\ntional length.  But that length is necessary.  I cannot refer \nto the history of the plans in these cases to justify the use\nof race-conscious criteria without describing that history \nin full.  I cannot rely upon Swann’s statement that the use \nof race-conscious limits is permissible without showing,\nrather than simply asserting, that the statement repre-\nsents  a  constitutional  principle  firmly  rooted  in  federal\nand state law.  Nor can I explain my disagreement with\nthe Court’s holding and the plurality’s opinion, without \noffering  a  detailed  account  of  the  arguments  they  pro-\npound and the consequences they risk.\nThus, the opinion’s reasoning is long.  But its conclusion \nis short: The plans before us satisfy the requirements of\nthe  Equal  Protection  Clause.  And  it  is  the  plurality’s\nopinion, not this dissent that “fails to ground the result it\nwould reach in law.”  Ante, at 28. \nFour  basic  considerations  have  led  me  to  this  view. \nFirst, the histories of Louisville and Seattle reveal com-\nplex circumstances and a long tradition of conscientious\nefforts by local school boards to resist racial segregation in\npublic schools.  Segregation at the time of Brown gave way \n\n64  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nto expansive remedies that included busing, which in turn\ngave rise to fears of white flight and resegregation.  For \ndecades  now,  these  school  boards  have  considered  and \nadopted and revised assignment plans that sought to rely \nless upon race, to emphasize greater student choice, and to\nimprove the conditions of all schools for all students, no\nmatter the color of their skin, no matter where they hap-\npen to reside.  The plans under review—which are less\nburdensome,  more  egalitarian,  and  more  effective  than\nprior plans—continue in that tradition.  And their history\nreveals school district goals whose remedial, educational, \nand democratic elements are inextricably intertwined each\nwith the others.  See Part I, supra, at 2–21. \nSecond, since this Court’s decision in Brown, the law \nhas consistently and unequivocally approved of both vol-\nuntary and compulsory race-conscious measures to combat \nsegregated schools.  The Equal Protection Clause, ratified\nfollowing the Civil War, has always distinguished in prac-\ntice between state action that excludes and thereby subor-\ndinates racial minorities and state action that seeks to \nbring together people of all races.  From Swann to Grutter, \nthis Court’s decisions have emphasized this distinction,\nrecognizing that the fate of race relations in this country\ndepends upon unity among our children, “for unless our \nchildren begin to learn together, there is little hope that\nour people will ever learn to live together.”  Milliken, 418 \nU. S., at 783 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  See also C. Sum-\nner, Equality Before the Law: Unconstitutionality of Sepa-\nrate Colored Schools in Massachusetts, in 2 The Works of \nCharles Sumner 327, 371 (1849) (“The law contemplates\nnot only that all be taught, but that all shall be taught \ntogether”).  See Part II, supra, at 21–37. \nThird, the plans before us, subjected to rigorous judicial \nreview, are supported by compelling state interests and \nare narrowly tailored to accomplish those goals.  Just as \ndiversity in higher education was deemed compelling in \n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  65 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nGrutter,  diversity  in  public  primary  and  secondary\nschools—where there is even more to gain—must be, a \nfortiori,  a  compelling  state  interest.  Even  apart  from \nGrutter, five Members of this Court agree that “avoiding\nracial isolation” and “achiev[ing] a diverse student popula-\ntion” remain today compelling interests.  Ante, at 17–18 \n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).  These interests combine reme-\ndial,  educational,  and  democratic  objectives.    For  the \nreasons discussed above, however, I disagree with JUSTICE \nKENNEDY  that  Seattle  and  Louisville  have  not  done \nenough to demonstrate that their present plans are neces-\nsary to continue upon the path set by Brown.  These plans \nare more “narrowly tailored” than the race-conscious law \nschool  admissions  criteria  at  issue  in  Grutter.  Hence, \ntheir lawfulness follows a fortiori from this Court’s prior \ndecisions.  See Parts III–IV, supra, at 37–57. \nFourth, the plurality’s approach risks serious harm to \nthe law and for the Nation.  Its view of the law rests either \nupon a denial of the distinction between exclusionary and \ninclusive use of race-conscious criteria in the context of the \nEqual Protection Clause, or upon such a rigid application \nof its “test” that the distinction loses practical significance. \nConsequently, the Court’s decision today slows down and \nsets back the work of local school boards to bring about \nracially diverse schools.  See Part V, supra, at 57–63. \nIndeed,  the  consequences  of  the  approach  the  Court \ntakes today are serious.  Yesterday, the plans under re-\nview were lawful.  Today, they are not.  Yesterday, the \ncitizens  of  this  Nation  could  look  for  guidance  to  this\nCourt’s  unanimous  pronouncements  concerning  desegre-\ngation.  Today, they cannot.  Yesterday, school boards had \navailable to them a full range of means to combat segre-\ngated schools.  Today, they do not.\nThe  Court’s  decision  undermines  other  basic  institu-\ntional  principles  as  well.  What  has  happened  to  stare \ndecisis?  The history of the plans before us, their educa-\n\n66  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\ntional  importance,  their  highly  limited  use  of  race—all\nthese and more—make clear that the compelling interest\nhere is stronger than in Grutter.  The plans here are more\nnarrowly tailored than the law school admissions program\nthere at issue.  Hence, applying Grutter’s strict test, their \nlawfulness follows a fortiori.  To hold to the contrary is to\ntransform that test from “strict” to “fatal in fact”—the very\nopposite of what Grutter said.  And what has happened to \nSwann?  To McDaniel?  To Crawford?  To Harris?  To \nSchool Committee of Boston?  To Seattle School Dist. No. \n1?  After decades of vibrant life, they would all, under the\nplurality’s logic, be written out of the law. \nAnd what of respect for democratic local decisionmaking\nby States and school boards?  For several decades this \nCourt has rested its public school decisions upon Swann’s \nbasic view that the Constitution grants local school dis-\ntricts a significant degree of leeway where the inclusive \nuse of race-conscious criteria is at issue.  Now localities \nwill  have  to  cope  with  the  difficult  problems  they  face\n(including resegregation) deprived of one means they may \nfind necessary. \nAnd what of law’s concern to diminish and peacefully \nsettle  conflict  among  the  Nation’s  people?  Instead  of \naccommodating different good-faith visions of our country\nand our Constitution, today’s holding upsets settled expec-\ntations, creates legal uncertainty, and threatens to pro-\nduce  considerable  further  litigation,  aggravating  race-\nrelated conflict. \nAnd what of the long history and moral vision that the \nFourteenth  Amendment  itself  embodies?    The  plurality\ncites in support those who argued in Brown against segre-\ngation, and JUSTICE THOMAS likens the approach that I\nhave taken to that of segregation’s defenders.  See ante, at \n39–41 (plurality opinion) (comparing Jim Crow segrega-\ntion to Seattle and Louisville’s integration polices); ante, \nat 28–32 (THOMAS, J., concurring).  But segregation poli-\n\nCite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)  67 \nBREYER, J., dissenting \ncies did not simply tell schoolchildren “where they could\nand could not go to school based on the color of their skin,” \nante, at 40 (plurality opinion); they perpetuated a caste \nsystem rooted in the institutions of slavery and 80 years of \nlegalized subordination.  The lesson of history, see ante, at \n39 (plurality opinion), is not that efforts to continue racial \nsegregation  are  constitutionally  indistinguishable  from \nefforts to achieve racial integration.  Indeed, it is a cruel \ndistortion of history to compare Topeka, Kansas, in the \n1950’s  to  Louisville  and  Seattle  in  the  modern  day—to \nequate the plight of Linda Brown (who was ordered to \nattend a Jim Crow school) to the circumstances of Joshua\nMcDonald (whose request to transfer to a school closer to\nhome was initially declined).  This is not to deny that \nthere is a cost in applying “a state-mandated racial label.” \nAnte, at 17 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concur-\nring in judgment).  But that cost does not approach, in\ndegree or in kind, the terrible harms of slavery, the result-\ning caste system, and 80 years of legal racial segregation. \n*    *    * \nFinally, what of the hope and promise of Brown?  For \nmuch of this Nation’s history, the races remained divided.\nIt was not long ago that people of different races drank \nfrom  separate  fountains,  rode  on  separate  buses,  and \nstudied in separate schools.  In this Court’s finest hour, \nBrown v. Board of Education challenged this history and \nhelped to change it.  For Brown held out a promise.  It was \na  promise  embodied  in  three  Amendments  designed  to\nmake citizens of slaves.  It was the promise of true racial\nequality—not as a matter of fine words on paper, but as a\nmatter of everyday life in the Nation’s cities and schools.\nIt was about the nature of a democracy that must work for\nall Americans.  It sought one law, one Nation, one people,\nnot simply as a matter of legal principle but in terms of\nhow we actually live. \n\n68  PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nNot everyone welcomed this Court’s decision in Brown. \nThree  years  after  that  decision  was  handed  down,  the \nGovernor of Arkansas ordered state militia to block the \ndoors of a white schoolhouse so that black children could \nnot enter.  The President of the United States dispatched\nthe 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas, and \nfederal  troops  were  needed  to  enforce  a  desegregation \ndecree.  See Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 (1958).  Today,\nalmost 50 years later, attitudes toward race in this Nation\nhave  changed  dramatically.  Many  parents,  white  and \nblack  alike,  want  their  children  to  attend  schools  with \nchildren of different races.  Indeed, the very school dis-\ntricts that once spurned integration now strive for it.  The \nlong history of their efforts reveals the complexities and\ndifficulties they have faced.  And in light of those chal-\nlenges, they have asked us not to take from their hands\nthe  instruments  they  have  used  to  rid  their  schools  of \nracial  segregation,  instruments  that  they  believe  are \nneeded to overcome the problems of cities divided by race \nand poverty.  The plurality would decline their modest \nrequest.\nThe plurality is wrong to do so.  The last half-century\nhas witnessed great strides toward racial equality, but we\nhave not yet realized the promise of Brown.  To invalidate \nthe  plans  under  review  is  to  threaten  the  promise  of \nBrown.  The plurality’s position, I fear, would break that \npromise.  This is a decision that the Court and the Nation \nwill come to regret.\nI must dissent. \n\nCite as: 551 U.

Plaintiff Crystal Meredith, on behalf of her son Joshua Ryan McDonald, \nappeals the decision of the district court to uphold the student assignment plan of the Jefferson \nCounty Public Schools, which includes racial guidelines.  The district court concluded that the \nassignment plan met the constraints of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nbecause the school board had a compelling interest to use the racial guidelines and applied them in \na manner that was narrowly tailored to realize its goals.  McFarland v. Jefferson County Public \nSchools, 330 F. Supp. 2d 834 (W.D. Ky. 2004). \nBecause the reasoning which supports summaryj udgment for defendants has been articulated \nin the well-reasoned opinion of the district court, the issuance of a detailed written opinion by this \ncourt would serve no useful purpose.  __ \nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.

DEFENDANTS\nORDER\nOn August 2, 2007, the Court convened a hearing to discuss any pending issues.  There\nappeared on behalf of Plaintiff, Mr. Theodore Gordon and Mr. Jeff Aston; on behalf of\nDefendants, Mr. Frank J. Mellen, Jr. and Ms. Rosemary Miller, General Counsel for the School\nBoard.\nAfter discussing the status of the case on remand from the United States Supreme Court,\nthe Court determined that based upon the School Board’s current expressed intentions, it was in\ncompliance with the Supreme Court’s ruling.  All present agreed and, therefore, no further ruling\nwas required.1  Plaintiff’s counsel stated that he would not be seeking any further equitable relief\non behalf of Plaintiff or any other persons.  The Court noted that this resolution was consistent\nwith the handling of relief arising from the Court’s decisions in 2000 and 2004.  Neither party\nraised additional issues.  The other pending issues concerning Plaintiff’s actual damages and\nattorney’s fees were set for briefing.  \n1   Plaintiff’s counsel is certainly free to raise additional issues based upon new facts. \n\nCase 3:02-cv-00620-JGH   Document 88   Filed 08/03/07   Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 1366\nThe Court being otherwise sufficiently advised,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for attorney fees (DN #84) and the motion\nfor damages (DN #80) are REMANDED and counsel for Plaintiff shall have thirty (30) days in\nwhich to resubmit the motions.\ncc: Counsel of Record",

DEFENDANTS\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nThe Court has considered Plaintiff’s motion to reopen this case and to sanction and\nenjoin Defendants from violation of the Supreme Court’s decision in Parents Involved in\nCommunity Schools, et al. v. Seattle School Distr. No. 1, et al., 127 S.Ct. 2738, _____ U.S.\n_____ (2007).\nAt a hearing on March 11, 2008, the Court heard arguments from both sides on the\npending motion.  These arguments centered upon whether Plaintiff’s new claims are ripe,\nwhether Plaintiff has standing to assert those claims and whether the instant case is moot.  The\nCourt did not directly consider the underlying hypothetical validity of Plaintiff’s new\nconstitutional allegations and this decision should not be considered as a ruling one way or\nanother on the constitutional compliance of the new plan.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court stated that it would deny the pending motion\nfor reasons which it explained extensively on the record.  The Court will not repeat its analysis\nhere other than to summarize that Plaintiff’s complaints raise new constitutional issues outside\nthe scope of this case as originally filed.  Plaintiff is not affected by the current interim\nassignment plan and therefore has no standing to raise a constitutional claim about it.  See Sutton\n\nCase 3:02-cv-00620-JGH   Document 125   Filed 03/12/08   Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 1727\nv. St. Jude Hosp. S.C., 419 F.3d. 568, 570 (6th Cir. 2005).\nThough Defendants have adopted the interim plan, as yet no students have been assigned\nbased upon it.  There is ample time to address concerns should any actually arise.  Therefore, the\nclaim itself is not ripe for consideration.  See Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49\n(1967).  For all those reasons and others stated, the Court finds this motion moot under the\ninstant case.\nBeing otherwise sufficiently advised,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff’s motion for relief is DENIED.\ncc: Counsel of Record\n2",
