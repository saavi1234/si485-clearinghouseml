The Complaint alleged that the Defendant mortgage lender applied more rigorous standards when evaluating mortgage applicants from prospective black and Hispanic borrowers. The Complaint stated that the Defendant had rejected black and Hispanic applicants at twice the rate of white applicants during the preceding two years. </p><p>The parties submitted a consent decree the same day at the Complaint was filed. U.S. District Court Judge Alfred V. Covello approved the consent decree, and the case was voluntarily dismissed by the DOJ. The consent decree required the Defendant to continue several recently implemented anti-discrimination procedures, including a mortgage review committee, which conducted a second review of all rejected minority credit applications; a mortgage customer assistance program; and periodic self-evaluations. In addition, the consent decree also required the Defendant to provide lending data to the Department of Justice on a regular basis for the following three years.</p><p></p>",

This court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1337a, and 1345; 42 U.S.C. § 3614;\nand 15 U.S.C. SS 45(m) (1) (A), 49, 53(b), 56(a), 57b, 1691(c) and 1691(h).\n3. Defendant, Shawmut Mortgage Company (or \"the mortgage company\" or \"the lender\"), is a Connecticut\nStock Corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Connecticut with its principal place of business\nin West Hartford, Connecticut. Shawmut Mortgage Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartford\nNational Corporation, a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with its\nprincipal place of business in Hartford, Connecticut. Hartford National Corporation is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Shawmut Services Corporation, a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the\nState of Delaware with its headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut. Shawmut Mortgage Company's business\nincludes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions and regularly extending credit to persons. The\nmortgage company is a creditor as that term is defined, by section 702(e) of the ECOA, 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(e),\nand is, therefore, subject to the requirements of the ECOA and its implementing Regulation B, as amended,\n12 C.F.R. Part 202, in effect on or after March 23, 1977.\n4. Beginning in January 1990, as required by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (\"HMDA\"), the mortgage\ncompany has maintained a Loan Application Register (\"LAR\") on which the lender's employees recorded\ninformation about each home loan application, including the applicants, income and race (or ethnicity), the\nloan amount, the type of loan, whether the subject property was to be owner-occupied, and the action taken\nby the mortgage company on the application. The mortgage company kept the LAR data in computerized\nform, in preparation both for the filing of annual HMDA reports to the mortgage company's federal bank\nregulatory agency and for internal reports that were circulated periodically to its management and employees.\nOn the basis of the LAR/HMDA reports management of the mortgage company knew that it had been\ndenying the home mortgage loan applications of black and Hispanic applicants at substantially higher rates\nthan white applicants. More specifically, the reports showed that:\na. in 1990 the mortgage company's overall denial rates for applications for conventional purchase and\nrefinancing loans combined were 123 of 317 (or 38.8%) for blacks; 68 of 205 (or 33.17%) for\nHispanics; and 1,193 of 6,892 (or 17.31%) for whites;\n2. in 1991 these denial rates were 122 of 359 (or 33.98%) for blacks; 68 of 222 (or 30.63%) for\n1 of 8 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nComplaint in Shawmut Mortgage Company http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutcomp.htm\nHispanics; and 1,122 of 7,634 (or 14.7%) for whites; and\n3. in 1992 these denial rates were 118 of 555 (or 21.26%) for blacks; 88 of 360 (or 24.44%) for\nHispanics; and 1,594 of 14,999 (or 10.63%) for whites.\n5. Prior to late 1991, when the mortgage company began to implement a special program to review the files of\ndenied minority applicants, it processed applications for home mortgages in the following manner:\na. employees of the mortgage company (usually with the title of \"loan counsellor\" or \"loan originator\")\ncontacted real estate agents and brokers, builders, and others involved in the sale of residential real\nestate, in order to develop sources of referrals of persons interested in borrowing money to purchase\nhomes (or to refinance their current outstanding home mortgage debts).\n2. It was the responsibility of the loan counsellor to have those seeking home mortgage loans present an\ninitial application containing the financial information deemed necessary by the mortgage company to\nmake an underwriting decision on the loan application (i.e., a decision whether to deny the application, \nto approve it under the terms requested, or to make a counter-offer). The required qualifying\ninformation included (among other things): The applicant(s)' income, employment history, education,\npast credit performance, outstanding financial obligations, assets (liquid and non-liquid), and the\napplicant(s)' projected monthly payment for the loan sought (including principal, interest, taxes, and\ninsurance). It was also the loan counsellor's responsibility to ascertain the existence of any \"offsetting\"\nqualifications of the applicant(s) that could compensate for one or more deficiencies in the required\nqualifying information.\n3. In addition to the information requested of the prospective borrower(s) by the application form, the\nmortgage company required applicant(s) to sign additional forms authorizing the lender to obtain\ndocumentation of the qualifying information claimed by the applicant(s). These additional forms\nincluded:\ni. A verification of Employment (VOE) form, to be executed by the applicant(s)' employer(s) and\nreturned to the mortgage company, verifying the applicant(s)' claimed base salary or wages for\nthe past two years and year-to-date, and secondary income (such as overtime, bonus, and\ncommission income). The VOE contains a box to be checked (\"yes\" or \"no\") as to whether the\napplicant(s)' secondary income is expected to continue;\n2. A Verification of Deposit (VOD) form, to be executed by the applicant(s)' financial depository\ninstitution(s) and returned to the mortgage company, verifying the amount of the applicant(s)'\nclaimed deposits;\n3. A mortgage or rent payment verification form, whichever was applicable, to be executed by the\napplicant(s)' former mortgagee or landlord and returned to the mortgage company, verifying the\napplicant(s)' prior mortgage or rent amount and payment history; and\n4. A credit report form authorizing a credit reporting firm selected by the mortgage company to\nverify on its behalf the amount and duration of the applicant(s)' financial obligations and to\nobtain both positive and negative information on the applicant(s)' credit history with respect to\nboth present and former financial obligations over the previous seven-year period.\nThe purpose of the verifications described in sub-paragraph (c) was to provide the lender with\ndocumentary evidence of the applicant(s)' claimed financial qualifications for loan approval, i.e., the \nability and willingness to repay the mortgage debt. In those instances where the qualifying information\nwas not susceptible to verification by use of standard forms (such as the VOE for the self-employed or\nthe VOD for those whose assets were not located in depository financial institutions), the mortgage\ncompany had the option to require applicant(s) to submit alternative documentation (such as copies of\ntax returns or proof of liquid assets not held by a depository institution) directly to the lender.\n2 of 8 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nComplaint in Shawmut Mortgage Company http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutcomp.htm\n4. Upon receipt of the verification forms by the lender, it was the responsibility of a loan processor (alone\nor in concert with the loan counsellor or the loan underwriter) to see to it that the forms were complete,\nproperly executed, and consistent with the applicant(s), claimed financial qualifications. In addition, it\nwas the loan processor's responsibility to place the documentation in the loan file, in preparation for\nsubmission of the application to the lender's underwriters for a decision. The extent of the\ndocumentation the mortgage company required for each loan application was dependent upon either the\nlender's internal standards with respect to loans it intended to hold in its own loan portfolio (or the\nportfolio of one of its affiliated depository institutions) or, for those loans that the mortgage company\nintended to sell, the external standards required by potential purchasers of the loan on the secondary\nmortgage market.\n5. With the exception of credit reporting agencies that reported derogatory credit history, those entities\nthat provided documentation to the mortgage company on the standard forms described in paragraph 5\nprovided none of the verification forms or the qualifying information contained therein directly to the\napplicant(s). If the credit report included derogatory information, the credit reporting agency, by means\nof a form letter, informed the applicant(s) of the existence of the derogatory information and advised\nthe applicant(s) to contact the credit reporting agency in order to correct claimed errors in the report.\n6. After assembling a loan file containing the application, the documentation of the applicant(s)' ability\nand willingness to repay the mortgage debt, and an appraisal of the subject property (used to document\nthe adequacy of the security value of the property to be mortgaged), the loan processor submitted the\nfile to the mortgage company's underwriters for a loan decision.\n7. It was the responsibility of the underwriter, prior to making an underwriting decision, to insure that all\nof the applicant(s)' claimed qualifying information was documented for the file, by obtaining the\ninformation from those who had been asked to supply it, or by requesting the loan processor to do so.\n8. Thereafter, it was the responsibility of the mortgage company's underwriters to review the entire loan\nfile to assess the evidence therein concerning the applicant(s) ability and willingness to repay the loan\nand the security value of the subject property. On the basis of this assessment, the underwriters made a\ndecision whether the mortgage company should approve the loan application under the terms requested,\ndeny the application under those terms but make a counteroffer to the applicant(s), or deny the\napplication. In making these decisions, it was the underwriter's responsibility to apply rules (or\n\"underwriting guidelines\") that were defined either by the mortgage company's internal standards for\nthose loans it intended to hold in its own loan portfolio (or the portfolio of one of its affiliated\ndepository institutions), or, for those loans that the mortgage company intended to sell, by the external\nstandards required by potential purchasers of the loan on the secondary mortgage market.\n6. Prior to late 1991, it was the lender's policy to allow its employees, in carrying out the procedures described\nin the previous paragraph, to exercise discretion in deciding the extent of the efforts they would make to\ndocument the qualifying information of loan applicants. Pursuant to this policy, the employees were free to\ndecide whether to request applicants for alternative documentation, depending on a variety of circumstances,\nincluding but not limited to circumstances:\na. when the standard verification forms described in subparagraphs 5 (c) (i)-(iv) were not provided for\ndocumentation of positive information, or\n2. when applicants might have been able to supply additional information that would compensate for\nnegative qualifying information or an explanation of any negative information that had been provided.\n7. Prior to late 1991, it was the lender's policy, pursuant to its internal underwriting guidelines and the external\nunderwriting guidelines of its secondary market purchasers, to allow its underwriters broad discretion in\napproving loan applications that failed to meet all guideline requirements, so long as the facts upon which the\nexceptions were made were adequately documented in the loan file. In addition, the mortgage company\npermitted underwriters to waive documentation of specific requirements if the file contained documentation\n3 of 8 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nComplaint in Shawmut Mortgage Company http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutcomp.htm\nof compensating or offsetting qualifying information.\n8. Prior to late 1991, it was the policy of the mortgage company to require different or varying levels or degrees\nof documentation of applicants' qualifying information, depending on a variety of circumstances, including\nbut not limited to:\na. the loan product sought by the applicants;\n2. the applicant(s)' provision of documentation of offsetting qualifications that could compensate for\ninadequacies in or lack of documentation of the applicant(s)' ability or willingness to pay or the\nsecurity value of the subject property;\n3. the mortgage company's contractual arrangements with one or more secondary market purchasers,\nunder which the loan purchasers agreed in advance to purchase loans that had been approved by the\nlender under exceptions, specifically set forth in the contract, to the documentation contained in such\npurchasers, published underwriting guidelines; and\n4. the mortgage company's allowance of formal \"underwriting exceptions,\" whereby named officers and\nemployees of the mortgage company were allowed to obtain the underwriter's approval of loan\napplications that failed to meet the lender's underwriting guidelines or that contained less\ndocumentation than that required of similarly situated applicants not applying under an exception. To\nthis end the mortgage company maintained an \"exceptions list\" that specified which named officers or\nemployees were entitled to invoke specifically described exceptions.\n9. Prior to late 1991, the lender had no mechanism in place to review the level of diligence exercised by its loan\ncounsellors, loan processors, or underwriters in obtaining documentation of black and Hispanic applicants'\nqualifying information or to review the level of discretion its underwriters exercised in applying internal or\nexternal underwriting criteria to their applications.\n10. During the period January 1990 through late 1991, the mortgage company failed to take adequate steps to\ninsure that its loan counsellors, loan processors, or underwriters exercised the same degree of diligence in\nobtaining documentation of qualifying information for black and Hispanic applicants as they exercised in\nobtaining such information for white applicants, or to take adequate steps to insure that its underwriters\napplied the same underwriting standards to black and Hispanic applicants as they did to white applicants.\n11. The mortgage company began to make policy changes in late 1991 that were intended to improve its\ntreatment of black and Hispanic applicants. However, these changes had only incremental impact prior to late\n1992. Specifically, in late 1991 the mortgage company instituted several changes in its policies and\nprocedures. This included a procedure whereby certain of its employees sitting on \"Mortgage Review\nCommittees\" were given the responsibility of reviewing the files of minority applicants whose loans had been\ndenied by the lender's underwriters. Between late 1991 and late 1992, the Mortgage Review committee\nprocess made some progress, but was not wholly effective in eliminating discriminatory practices. Instead of\ncreating a mechanism that would insure fair treatment of all applicants by loan counsellors, loan processors\nand underwriters, the lender allowed the Mortgage Review Committee to obtain applicant qualifying\ninformation that either contradicted that obtained by the loan counsellors, loan processors or underwriters or\nprovided offsetting or compensatory information that would justify loan approval.\n12. Prior to late 1992 or early 1993, the mortgage company failed to instruct its loan counsellors or loan\nprocessors to obtain documentation of, or underwriters to consider:\na. the stability of applicants' income (in contrast to the stability of applicants' employment) in\ndocumenting applicants' ability to repay the mortgage loan;\n2. applicants, prior record of rent and utility payments (in contrast to credit history as reflected by\napplicants, performance in repaying contractual debt) in documenting applicants, ability and\n4 of 8 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nComplaint in Shawmut Mortgage Company http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutcomp.htm\nwillingness to repay the mortgage loan;\n3. applicants' non-traditional sources of cash for down payment, such as family revolving loans or cash\nthat was not held by the applicants in depository financial institutions; and\n4. the income and assets of applicants, extended family members, who planned to reside at the property\nsubject to the mortgage but who were not co-applicants, in documenting applicants' ability to repay the\nmortgage loan.\n13. Prior to late 1991, the lender's management knew or should have known that the implementation of its\npolicies and practices resulted in discrimination against black and Hispanic loan applicants. More\nspecifically, these officials knew or should have known that:\na. at each stage of the loan application process described in paragraph 5, the mortgage company's\nemployees exercised the discretion allowed to them by the policies described in paragraphs 6 though 8;\n2. black and Hispanic applicants who could have qualified for approval were being denied loans as the\nresult of the failure of the lender's employees to undertake sufficient steps to obtain documentation of\nthe applicants, qualifying information;\n3. white applicants were approved when they did not meet all of the mortgage company's underwriting\nguidelines or when the documentation of their qualifying information was in part missing or\nincomplete; and\n4. black and Hispanic applicants were more likely than white applicants to benefit from the formal\nchanges made in the lender's documentation requirements as described in paragraph 12.\nFrom late 1991 to late 1992, the Mortgage Review Committees, in reversing denials made by underwriters,\nconsistently found that these employees had failed to exercise the diligence expected of them in documenting\nthe qualifying information of black and Hispanic applicants.\n14. As a result of the manner in which the policies and practices described in paragraphs 5 through 13 were\nimplemented, black and Hispanic applicants who sought home mortgage loans from the mortgage company\nduring the period January 1990 through late 1991, and in some instances between late 1991 and late 1992,\nwere:\na. subjected to more stringent standards than were white applicants, either by the failure of the lender's\nunderwriters to consider their offsetting or compensating qualifying information to the extent that such\ninformation was considered for white applicants, or by the underwriters, subjecting them to higher\nunderwriting standards than those applied to white applicants;\n2. provided with lesser opportunities than were white applicants to document their qualifying information;\nor\n3. denied loans under underwriting policies and practices that had a greater negative impact on their\nchances for loan approval than on the approval chances of white applicants.\n15. The disparities in denial rates between white home mortgage loan applicants and black and Hispanic\napplicants during the period January 1990 through October 1992 cannot be fully attributed to differences in\nthe relative qualifications of white and minority applicants.\n16. The manner in which the mortgage company's policies and practices were implemented, as described in\nparagraphs 5 through 13 constituted:\na. discrimination on the basis of race or national origin in making available residential real estate-related\ntransactions in violation of Section 805 of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a);\n5 of 8 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nComplaint in Shawmut Mortgage Company http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutcomp.htm\n2. the making unavailable or the denial of dwellings to persons, because of race or national origin, in\nviolation of Section 804(a) of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); and\n3. discrimination on the basis of race or national origin in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the\nprovision of services or facilities in connection with the sale or rental of dwellings, in violation of\nSection 804(b) of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b).\n17. During the period January 1990 through October 1992, on numerous occasions, defendant has denied\nmortgage credit to black and Hispanic applicants, while extending mortgage credit to similarly qualified\nwhite applicants, and has thereby discriminated against black and Hispanic applicants on the basis of race or\nnational origin, thereby violating Section 701(a) (1) of the ECOA, 15 U.S.C. § 1691; and Section 202.4 of\nRegulation B.\n18. Defendant has engaged in the practices described in this Complaint with knowledge as set forth in Section\n5(m) (1) (A) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(m) (1) (a).\n19. The discriminatory practices of defendant as described in this Complaint were implemented with disregard\nfor the rights of black and Hispanic persons.\n20. During the period January 1990 through October 1992, the defendant engaged in a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination in home mortgage lending, in violation of the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act by:\na. requiring a higher level of documentation of black and Hispanic applicants' qualifying information than\nit required of white applicants;\n2. failing to make an effort to obtain documentation of black and Hispanic applicants, qualifying\ninformation comparable to the efforts made to obtain documentation of the qualifying information of\nwhite applicants;\n3. failing to obtain qualifying information from black and Hispanic applicants that would compensate for\napparent disqualifying information;\n4. failing to approve loans for qualified black and Hispanic applicants under the same underwriting\nstandards that were applied to qualified white applicants;\n5. failing to approve loans for black and Hispanic applicants whose qualifications as documented in the\nmortgage company's loan files did not meet all of its underwriting standards but nevertheless met\nstandards that were equal to or greater than those applied to similarly situated white applicants; and\n6. failing to take steps to insure that the policy of granting exceptions for certain applicants, as described\nin paragraph 8 (d), did not result in the application of discriminatory standards to minority applicants.\n21. During the period January 1990 through October 1992, the defendant engaged in a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination against minority applicants with respect to credit transactions, in violation of the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691(A) (1), by failing to implement the policy changes described in paragraph\n12, thereby continuing an overall loan processing system that had the effect of discriminating against black\nand Hispanic applicants.\n22. The implementation of the defendant's policies and practices as described in this Complaint, constitutes:\na. a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights secured by the Title VIII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §§\n3601-3619; and\n2. a denial to a group of persons of rights granted by Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as\n6 of 8 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nComplaint in Shawmut Mortgage Company http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutcomp.htm\namended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619, that raises an issue\nof general public importance.\n23. Persons who have been victims of defendant's discriminatory practices as described in this Complaint are\naggrieved persons as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 3602(i). As a consequence of defendant's practices, these persons\nhave been denied their rights to equal opportunity in housing, credit, and residential real estate-related\ntransactions. Some victims also have experienced other actual, compensable injuries, such as economic loss.\nWHEREFORE, the United State's prays that the court enter an ORDER that:\na. declares that the totality of the policies and practices of defendant constitutes a violation of the Fair Housing\nAct, the FTC Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act;\n2. enjoins defendant, its agents, employees and successors, and all other persons in active concert or\nparticipation with it, from discriminating on account of race or national origin in any aspect of their mortgage\nlending activities;\n3. requires defendant to develop and submit to the court for its approval a detailed plan that: (a) remedies the\nvestiges of defendant's discriminatory policies and practices; and (b) ensures that future black and Hispanic\nmortgage loan applicants will be treated in a nondiscriminatory manner that does not differ from the treatment\nafforded to white applicants;\n4. awards such damages or redress as would fully compensate the victims of defendant's discriminatory conduct\nfor the injuries caused by the defendant; and\n5. assesses civil penalties against defendant, in order to vindicate the public interest.\nThe United States further prays for such additional relief as the interests of justice may require.\nJANET RENO\nAttorney General\nJAME P.

The Complaint alleges that the mortgage company has engaged in\npolicies and practices that discriminated on the basis of race and national origin in its home mortgage lending\nbusiness.\nThe lender denies all of the allegations in the Complaint and states that it has never discriminated on the basis of race\nor national origin in its mortgage lending business.\nMore specifically, the United States alleges that the mortgage company, during the period January 1990 through\nOctober 1992, engaged in lending practices that discriminated on the basis of race and national origin by requiring a\nhigher level of documentation of black and Hispanic applicants' qualifying information than it required of white\napplicants; failing to make the same level of effort to obtain documentation of black and Hispanic applicants'\nqualifying information that was made to obtain documentation of the qualifying information of white applicants;\nfailing to obtain qualifying information from black and Hispanic applicants that would compensate for apparent\ndisqualifying information; applying more stringent underwriting standards to black and Hispanic applicants by\nfailing to consider the offsetting or compensating information they supplied to the same extent that such information\nwas considered in approving the loan applications of similarly situated white applicants; failing to approve loans for\nblack and Hispanic applicants whose qualifications as documented in the mortgage company's loan files did not meet\nall of the mortgage company's underwriting standards but nevertheless met standards that were equal to or greater\nthan those applied to similarly situated white applicants; and failing to take steps to insure that the policy of granting\nexceptions for certain applicants did not result in the application of discriminatory standards to black and Hispanic\napplicants.\nThe parties have agreed that, in order to avoid protracted and costly litigation, this controversy should be resolved\nvoluntarily. The parties have also agreed that there should be no evidentiary hearing, trial or other adjudication on\nthe merits, and that the entry of this Consent Decree is not to be construed as an admission by the mortgage company\nof the validity of any of the claims asserted in this action.\nNow therefore, on the basis of the foregoing representations of the United States and the mortgage company, it is\nhereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED as follows:\nI. GENERAL INJUNCTIVE PROVISION\n1. The Shawmut Mortgage Company, its officials, employees, and agents, as well as successors, as provided in \nparagraph 10, below, are enjoined from engaging in any act or practice that discriminates on the basis of race\nor national origin in the provision of home mortgages, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection\nwith any such transactions; and from imposing on the basis of race or national origin different terms or\nconditions for the availability of home mortgage loans. Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604 and 3605; Equal\n1 of 6 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nShawmut Mortgage Settlement http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutsettle.htm\nCredit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a)(1), and Regulation B, 12 C.F.R. § 202.\nII. SPECIFIC INJUNCTIVE PROVISIONS\n2. The United States recognizes that the mortgage company, beginning in late 1991, and particularly since\nOctober 1992, has implemented a comprehensive fair lending compliance program to improve its outreach to\npotential black and Hispanic borrowers and to ensure that black and Hispanic borrowers who apply for credit\nare treated in a non-discriminatory fashion, both in the processing of their applications before underwriting,\nand in the underwriting decisions themselves. Several of the key elements of this program include the planned\nopening of a branch in the predominantly minority community of Roxbury, Massachusetts; the change of the\ncompensation structure of loan originators to add incentives to encourage the origination of loans on\nlower-valued homes; the extension of its advertising program in minority-oriented media, such as newspapers\nand radio stations; the extension of its marketing program efforts to reach into predominantly minority\nneighborhoods; the training of loan counsellors, loan originators, loan processors and loan underwriters in the\nprinciples of fair processing and fair underwriting of loan applications; and the expansion of the role of its\nMortgage Review Committee, which re-evaluates the qualifications of all denied minority applicants, to\ninclude all other applicants whose applications were denied and whose incomes are 115% or less than the\nmedian for their metropolitan areas.\nThe United States believes that this fair lending compliance program, as more specifically described below and\nin Attachment 1 to this Decree, is now working well and is adequate to ensure the lender's compliance with the\nfair lending provisions of the Equal Credit opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. Those aspects of the fair\nlending compliance program the mortgage company has devised to insure that all home loan applications are\nfully processed and fairly considered are set out below. In addition, Attachment 1 describes the lender's\ninnovative loan products designed to facilitate home ownership by low-to-moderate income persons; its\nparticipation in a variety of state and federal loan programs with similar goals; and the marketing and outreach\nactivities it uses to inform potential low-to-moderate income and minority borrowers of loan availability.\nA. Mortgage Review Committees\nIn November 1991 the mortgage company established Mortgage Review committees (\"MRCs\"), one for\nMassachusetts/New Hampshire and one for Connecticut/Rhode Island, to provide a mandatory second\nlook at all minority applications before they are declined. The mortgage company gave the committees\nauthority to approve the loan, affirm the underwriter's decision, or return the file with a request for more\ninformation. The MRCs initially consisted entirely of senior managers. The committee structure has\nbecome more formalized over time. Since October 1992 the MRCs have been staffed by an array of\nexperienced managers and underwriters, including experienced lending professionals who are members\nof minority groups. In addition, in April 1993 the lender's minority advocate, an African-American with\nextensive experience in affordable housing issues, joined both MRCs.\nThe MRC process has evolved in other ways as well. Over time, the committee members have kept more\ndetailed minutes and have distributed the minutes more widely to enable underwriters to better\nunderstand the analytical basis for MRC loan approval decisions and to use that learning to improve\ntheir own underwriting. On November 1, 1993, the mortgage company invested six senior underwriters\nwith the MRC's approval authority so that they could work with their underwriting colleagues to ensure\nthat all avenues for potential approval are exhausted at the initial underwriting stage. In addition, on\nNovember 23, 1993, the lender issued a memorandum informing its underwriters of the major reasons\nthe MRC has approved loans and directing them to employ these analytical tools themselves.\n2. Mortgage Customer Assistance Program\nIn early 1993, the mortgage company created the Shawmut Mortgage Customer Assistance (\"SMCA\")\nprogram and hired an African-American with extensive affordable housing experience to serve as an\nadvocate for minority applicants. Since April 1, 1993, at the time of application, all minority applicants\nhave received a letter informing them of the SMCA program and giving them a telephone number to call\nfor assistance. The letter also describes the twin goals of the SMCA program: (1) to provide information\n2 of 6 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nShawmut Mortgage Settlement http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutsettle.htm\nand assistance in the loan application process; and (2) to ensure that every loan application is processed\nin full compliance with the lender's equal credit and fair housing obligations.\n3. Self-Evaluation\nThe mortgage company engages in rigorous self-analysis of its fair lending performance. In late 1992,\nthe Corporate Credit Review Department conducted a sample file review to assess whether white and\nblack applicants with similar credit characteristics were being treated similarly in the underwriting\nprocess. In addition, the lender retained an outside consultant in late 1992 to conduct a \"mystery shopper\nprogram\" to assess whether it was treating minority and non-minority applicants similarly in the\npre-application process. The testing was conducted between February and April 1993.\nOn October 8, 1993, Shawmut National Corporation's CRA Policy Committee initiated a comprehensive\nfair lending compliance program. Pursuant to this initiative, the mortgage company has begun the\nprocess of reviewing all of its lending policies and procedures for conformity with its regulatory fair\nlending obligations and with the Corporation's Fair Lending Mission Statement. It has retained a well\nregarded outside consultant to assist with this program and has commenced a search for an experienced\nDirector of Consumer Compliance.\nThe mortgage company will continue these programs, or similar programs, along with additional\nprograms that have been implemented by the lender to serve these goals, during the duration of this\nDecree.\nOf equal importance to the United States in agreeing to the terms of this settlement is that the changes\nthe mortgage company made in November 1992 in its loan processing and underwriting procedures were\nthe direct result of the lender's forthright self-evaluation of the differences in the ways it treated minority\nand white applicants. In recognition of the mortgage company's incremental, and ultimately effective,\nsteps to correct its fair lending deficiencies, the United States has agreed that it will not be necessary to\nhave this Court impose upon the mortgage company extensive affirmative procedural practices to insure\ncompliance with the general injunctive provisions of this Decree. In further recognition of the\nself-evaluative and immediate self-corrective steps that the mortgage company has taken, the United\nStates has agreed to a compensation amount, as described in paragraph 7, below, for those injured by the\nlender's practices during the period January 1990 through October 1992, that is designed only to make\nwhole those persons who may have been injured by past discriminatory conduct; the amount contains no\npunitive sanctions and is approximately half of the amount the United States would have insisted upon in\nthe absence of such corrective actions. The agreed-upon level of compensation also takes into\nconsideration the reduced costs to the United States in proving its case.\nIII. RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n3. For a three-year period, the mortgage company will retain all loan application files submitted for home\nmortgage loans and all documents and notices relevant to any underwriting decisions, including Mortgage\nReview Committee decisions. The lender will also retain all records relating to its fair lending compliance\nprogram, including documents concerning its employee training on fair lending, mortgage production,\nemployee recruitment, and compliance activities, as they relate to black and Hispanic borrowers and potential\nborrowers.\n4. To fairly monitor the mortgage company's processing and evaluation of home mortgage loan applicants under\nthis Consent Decree, the United States may, from time to time, seek and be provided access to individual home\nmortgage loan application files and related records such as the minutes of the lender's Mortgage Review\nCommittees, provided such requests are reasonable and are made upon reasonable notice and in writing to the\nmortgage company. The United States will keep all records and information relating to loan applicants\nconfidential to protect the applicants, privacy rights. If the United States identifies any concerns with respect to\nthe mortgage company's compliance with this Consent Decree in its treatment of home mortgage loan\napplicants, it will promptly notify the lender of its concerns and seek to resolve them.\n3 of 6 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nShawmut Mortgage Settlement http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutsettle.htm\n5. The mortgage company will report its progress under this Consent Decree to the Civil Rights Division of the\nUnited States Department of Justice on a semi-annual basis for the first year, and annually thereafter for the\nnext two years. All reports will be submitted to the United States within 30 days after the close of each\nreporting period and will include the following information:\na. A general report on the mortgage company's performance, in marketing and outreach to potential\nborrowers, and in its processing and underwriting of black and Hispanic applicants for mortgage credit.\nThis report should discuss, among other things, the lender's advertising, marketing, mortgage production,\nemployee recruitment, compliance activities, underwriting, and Mortgage Review Committee activities,\nas they relate to black and Hispanic borrowers and potential borrowers; and\n2. A report in machine-readable form from its automated loan tracking system for all home mortgage loan\napplicants. The variables to be included in the reports will be agreed upon by the parties prior to the first\nreporting period.\n6. Copies of all notices, correspondence, reports, or documents required to be provided by one party to the other\nunder this Consent Decree will be mailed to the following addresses:\nFor the United States:\nChief, Housing and Civil Enforcement Section\nCivil Rights Division\nU.S. Department of Justice\nP.O. Box 65998\nWashington, DC 20035\nFor the Shawmut Mortgage Company\nDirector of Compliance\n433 South Main Street\nWest Hartford, CN 06110\nIV. COMPENSATORY RELIEF\n7. The mortgage company will place Nine Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars ($960,000.00) into a Shawmut\nMortgage Company Consent Decree Compensation Fund to be administered at the direction of the United\nStates. The purpose of this fund is to compensate those who were injured by the mortgage company's practices\nduring the period January 1990 through October 1992. It is agreed and understood between the patties that\n$160,000 of the compensation fund is to be paid by the mortgage company in lieu of civil money penalties that\nwould have been payable, if assessed, to the United States Treasury pursuant to Section 5(m) (1) (A) of the\nFederal Trade Commission Act, Section 704 (c) of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Regulation B. The\ncompensation fund will be administered as follows:\na. the lender's personnel will review all loan files of rejected black and Hispanic applicants under the\nreview standards that have been used by the Mortgage Review Committee since October 1992;\n2. the mortgage company will then compile a list of those applicants who would have been accepted or\nmade counteroffers, and state its reasons for affirming all loan denials for black and Hispanic applicants\nduring the period January 1990 through October 1992; and\n3. the United States will then review the files and the reasons for continued denial of those not identified as\neligible for compensation and will have the right to add any whom it believes should be included as\npayees. The United States will also review the circumstances surrounding the denials of the payees'\napplications, and will identify any persons who were unusually damaged by the denial and who may,\ntherefore, be entitled to additional compensation (not to exceed a total of $15,000 for any individual).\n8. The mortgage company will then notify all payees by registered mail, return receipt requested, of the nature of\n4 of 6 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nShawmut Mortgage Settlement http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutsettle.htm\nthe settlement and of their right to receive compensation, and will include a copy of the Consent Decree with\nthe notice. It will notify the United States of the names and last known addresses of all payees from whom no\nreturn receipt has been received within thirty days of the mailing of the notice, and the United States will have\nan additional thirty days to locate these payees and provide them with a copy of the notice. The notice will\ninclude a requirement that each payee respond within 60 days of receipt of the notice and execute a waiver, in\nthe form set forth in attachment 2, of any additional rights to proceed against the mortgage company on claims\narising from the same facts. Each payee will receive $10,000, except where special circumstances warrant a\ngreater payment (as described in paragraph 7) or a lower amount (if the United States agrees that any lower \npayments are warranted by the circumstances of the denials). The mortgage company will issue checks to each\npayee for the designated amount.\n9. The disposition of any amount remaining in the fund after all payees have been compensated will be\ndetermined by the United States. In the event that the fund is insufficient to compensate all payees according to\nthe provisions of this decree, the mortgage company will supplement the fund to provide the required\ncompensation.\nV. SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST\n10. The terms of this Consent Decree will bind any successor in interest to the Shawmut Mortgage Company as to\nemployees, branches, and offices now under the control of the mortgage company, branches subsequently\nacquired by the mortgage company, and any branches into which the mortgage company branches are\nconsolidated. It is assumed by the parties that any successor in interest will voluntarily implement the\nprovisions of this Consent Decree in all successor-in-interest branches located in the lender's current service\narea, but if any such successor in interest declines to voluntarily implement the provisions of the Decree in all\nsuch branches and offices, it shall present to the United States its proposed plan of operation. If the United\nStates concludes that the proposed plan of operation will hinder the attainment of the goals of this Consent\nDecree it shall present such concerns to the successor in interest and attempt to resolve the differences\nvoluntarily. Any differences that cannot be resolved by the parties may be presented to the court for resolution.\nVI. MODIFICATION\n11. This Consent Decree may be modified by written agreement of the defendant, the Department of Justice, and\nthe Federal Trade Commission.\nVII. RETENTION OF JURISDICTION\n12. For a three-year period, this Court will retain jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing all provisions of this\nConsent Decree. The parties to the Decree will endeavor in good faith to resolve informally any differences\nregarding interpretation and compliance with this Consent Decree prior to bringing such matters to the court\nfor resolution. Thereafter, the court will retain jurisdiction for an additional seven-year period solely for the\npurpose of enforcing the general injunctive provision.\nVIII. COSTS\n13. Each party to this litigation will bear its own costs.\nIt is so ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED this ________ day of 1993.\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nThe undersigned apply for consent to the entry of this Order:\nFor the United States:\nJANET RENO\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n5 of 6 7/6/2007 1:39 PM\n\nShawmut Mortgage Settlement http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/shawmutsettle.htm\nJAMES P.

      "text": "Fair Lending Enforcement Program http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/bll_01.htm\nUnderwriting Discrimination\nDiscrimination in underwriting -- the process of evaluating the qualifications of credit applicants -- was\nthe issue in our investigations leading to suits against Decatur Federal Savings & Loan Association in\nAtlanta, The Northern Trust Company in Chicago, and First National Bank of Doña Ana County in New\nMexico. United States v. Decatur Federal Savings & Loan Association, Case No. 1 92-CV-2198-CAM\n(N.D. Ga. 1992); United States v. The Northern Trust Company, Civil Action No. 95C 3239 (N.D. Ill.\n1995); United States v. First National Bank of Doña Ana County, Civil Action No. 97-0096 HB (D.N.M.\n1997). Our attention was focused on these institutions by Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)\nstatistics showing that African-American and Hispanic applicants were rejected for mortgage loans at\nsignificantly higher rates than were white applicants. When our lawyers examined loan files, they\nuncovered disturbing evidence that bank employees were providing assistance to white applicants that\nthey were not providing to African-American and Hispanic applicants. Loan officers often did not help\nminority applicants explain negative information on their credit reports and document all of their income.\nSimilar loan officer behavior was responsible for the inordinately high denial rate of African-American\napplicants underlying the Federal Reserve Board's referral to us of the Shawmut Mortgage Company in\nBoston. United States v. Shawmut Mortgage Company, Case No. 3:93CV-2453 (AVC) (D. Conn. 1993).\nThe relief we obtained in these four underwriting suits included fair lending training for loan officers,\nadvertising and marketing to minority communities, \"second reviews\" of rejected minority applications,\nand new bank branches in minority neighborhoods. Our lawsuits against these lenders, and follow-up\nbank examinations by the regulatory agencies, have focused lending industry attention on this issue and,\nwe hope, encouraged lenders to institute a variety of programs to prevent disparate treatment.\n1 of 1 7/6/2007 1:52 PM",
