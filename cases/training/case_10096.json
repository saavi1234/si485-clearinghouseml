Georgia, Atlanta Division.\nFebruary 29, 2000.\n11332245 *1324*1325 Georgia Kay Lord, Nelson, Hill, Lord & Beasley, Decatur, GA, for plaintiff.\nWilliam Henry Major, III, Allen William Nelson, David Hunt Wilson, Anthony Paul Tatum, Hawkins & Parnell,\nAtlanta, GA, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER\nSTORY, District Judge.\nPlaintiff Joyce Sallion brings this action alleging Defendant SunTrust Bank, Atlanta, f/k/a Trust Company Bank\n(\"SunTrust\") rejected her application for a loan based on her race and marital status in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง\n1981, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1982, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1691 et seq. (\"ECOA\"). In addition,\nSallion alleges Defendant Beverly Wittler, a SunTrust loan originator, also violated ECOA by providing her with\nless assistance in the preparation of her loan file than what Wittler normally provided to loan applicants outside\nthe protected classes. Before the Court is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [39-1]. After reviewing the\nentire record and considering all arguments of the parties, the Court enters the following Order.\nI. Factual Background\nIn 1994 Sallion contacted Beverly Wittler, a loan originator, to discuss the possibility of qualifying in advance for a\nloan to construct a house on a lot she and her husband purchased. After reviewing Sallion's financial information,\nWittler testified she recommended Sallion apply for a loan in the amount of $108,000, but Sallion allegedly\nignored the recommendation and directed Wittler to submit a loan application for $132,000. (Def.'s Ex. A., Wittler\nAff. ยถ 9.) Sallion disagrees, explaining \"What I asked for was for them to tell me how much house I could afford;\nand on the basis of that, then I would select the house that I wanted.\" (Sallion Dep. at 64.) According to Sallion's\ntestimony, Wittler proposed a loan amount of $132,250 to Sallion, who apparently never objected, and Wittler\nsubmitted the loan for this amount. (Id. at 103, 108.)\nOn August 3, 1994, Nancy Wallis, a SunTrust underwriter, denied Sallion's application for a loan of $132,250\nallegedly because she did not qualify for the loan due to (1) insufficient verifiable income, (2) an unacceptable\ndebt to income ratio, (3) delinquent credit obligations, and (4) insufficient closing funds. (Pl.'s Ex. 7 at\n100001-003.) This determination rested in part on the finding Sallion had failed to verify monthly income of $1500\nfrom a recent divorce. Ellen Lighton, also a SunTrust underwriter, reviewed the application and agreed with\nWallis's decision. (Lighton Dep. at 24.)\nWittler then obtained Sallion's handwritten explanation of her credit history and resubmitted Sallion's application\nto underwriting. (Wittler Dep. at 39.) Lighton denied the resubmitted application on August 18, noting that even if\nSallion could submit sufficient verification of her alleged $1500 monthly alimony income, her debt to income ratios\nwould still exceed banking guidelines. (Pl.'s Ex. 7 at 100004; Lighton Aff. ยถยถ 16-17.) Based on the loan amount\n1326 and Sallion's slow payment credit history, Lighton also concluded the bank required *1326 more closing funds\n\nand reserve funds than Sallion possessed. (Pl.'s Ex. 7 at 100004; Lighton Aff. ยถยถ 19-21.) Set forth below is a\nmore detailed explanation of SunTrust's proffered reasons and Sallion's responses thereto.\nA. Insufficient Verifiable Income\nSunTrust did not consider the $1500 alimony payment because Sallion could not provide proof she received the\npayments consistently over the previous twelve months. Under the terms of the divorce decree, the payments did\nnot begin until April 1994, just four months before Sallion submitted her loan application to SunTrust. Sallion thus\nfailed to satisfy the following SunTrust underwriting guideline:\n1. Child Support/Alimony\nA copy of the executed divorce decree, property settlement agreement and/or separation\nagreement reflecting the amount and duration of the payment is required.\nIt will also be necessary to substantiate receipt of the amounts specified therein; and the income\nin question must continue for at least three years. A copy of the court transcript if paid through the\ncourts is considered acceptable proof of receipt. If the payments are not made through the courts,\ncopies of canceled checks or validated deposit slips showing regular deposits of said income for\nthe last 12 months are acceptable verification of receipt.\n(Pl.'s Ex. 11 at 285.) Sallion admits she cannot show receipt of payment for twelve months, but argues the\nverification requirement violates ECOA's proscription of discrimination based on marital status because it\nestablishes more stringent standards of verification for alimony than other types of income. (Resp.Br. at Part III\n(D).)\nB. Insufficient Closing Funds\nIt is undisputed Sallion lacked $650 of the $16,936.10 she needed to close the $132,250 loan. Sallion's complaint\nis that SunTrust never informed her of this concern before rejecting her application, thus denying her the\nopportunity to increase her available funds by collecting $3000 from her son as payment for a loan she gave him.\n(Sallion Aff. ยถ 9.) In addition, Sallion argues her closing and reserve funds would have been sufficient had\nSunTrust been more flexible and considered her for a smaller loan.\nC. Credit History\nSallion admits her credit report contained some late payments and one charged-off debt, but contends SunTrust\ndid not deny her loan application based on her alleged poor credit history. (Pl.'s Ex. 8 at 200048.) Two pieces of\nevidence allegedly support this contention. First, SunTrust's statement of credit denial sent to Sallion when\nSunTrust rejected the loan application for the second time states \"The Credit Reporting Agency information on\nyou did not influence our decision.\" (Pl.'s Ex. 7 at 100002.) Second, SunTrust's loan files allegedly show the bank\nextended credit to many white applicants with poorer credit histories. (Pl.'s Exs. 24-30.)\nD. Debt to Income Ratios\nAfter SunTrust concluded Sallion's alimony payment of $1500 was unverifiable and thus could not be considered\nfor purposes of the loan application, it recalculated Sallion's debt to income ratios and found they exceeded\nSunTrust's guidelines. Sallion does not attack the correctness of the calculations, but advances instead the\nargument described above that SunTrust's verification requirements for alimony payments violate ECOA. Sallion\nalso alleges this proffered reason is unworthy of belief because at the time of the application denial SunTrust\n\"approv[ed] numerous loan applications which reflected poorer ratios and poorer credit, as well as applications\nwith more significant problems regarding verification of income.\" (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Facts ยถ 7.)\n\n1327  E. Additional Evidence of Discrimination\n*1327\nAside from arguing the underwriters' proffered reasons for denying the loan are pretextual, Sallion also blames\nWittler for the denial, claiming Wittler failed to (1) inform underwriters Sallion did not demand any certain loan\namount, and (2) provide the underwriters with additional information about Sallion that would have increased her\nchances of receiving the loan. In addition, Sallion claims Wittler provided her with a lower level of service than\nshe provided white applicants.\nII. Discussion\nA district court shall grant summary judgment when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is (1) no genuine issue as to any material\nfact and that (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). The trial judge\nshould not weigh the evidence to determine the truth of the matter but should only determine whether there is a\ngenuine issue for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202\n(1986). The moving party is entitled to summary judgment when, after adequate time for discovery, the\nnonmoving party completely fails to prove an essential element of his case with respect to which he has the\nburden of proof. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).\n[1]\nSallion's claims are best analyzed under the methods of proof used in employment discrimination claims.\nSallion may therefore prove her claims by direct evidence of discriminatory intent, statistical proof of a\ndiscriminatory pattern and practice, or by circumstantial evidence through application of the McDonnell-Douglas\nframework. Sallion has submitted both direct evidence and circumstantial evidence in support of her marital\nstatus discrimination claim and circumstantial evidence only in support of her race discrimination claim. The Court\nwill therefore consider Sallion's direct evidence of marital status discrimination first, then analyze Sallion's\ncircumstantial evidence of racial and marital status discrimination together through application of the McDonnell-\nDouglas test.\nA. Direct Evidence of Marital Status Discrimination\nSallion alleges SunTrust's underwriting guidelines are facially discriminatory because they impose more stringent\nverification requirements on alimony income than other types of income, thereby treating alimony recipients less\nfavorably than others based solely on their marital status. Section 1691(a)(1) of ECOA proscribes discrimination\nby creditors against applicants on the basis of marital status. Regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal\nReserve Bank state, in pertinent part, that \"[w]hen an applicant relies on alimony .... in applying for credit, the\ncreditor shall consider such payments as income to the extent that they are likely to be consistently made.\" 12\nC.F.R. ยง 202.6(b)(5).\n1328 *1328 SunTrust underwriting guidelines describe the requirements for verification of alimony income as follows:\nI. Other Miscellaneous Income\n1. Child Support/Alimony\nA copy of the executed divorce decree, property settlement agreement and/or separation\nagreement reflecting the amount and duration of the payment is required.\nIt will also be necessary to substantiate receipt of the amounts specified therein; and the income\nin question must continue for at least three years. A copy of the court transcript if paid through the\ncourts is considered acceptable proof of receipt. If the payments are not made through the courts,\ncopies of canceled checks or validated deposit slips showing regular deposits of said income for\nthe last 12 months are acceptable verification of receipt.\n\n(Pl.'s Ex. 11 at 37.) Sallion listed on her application receipt of two alimony payments per month in the amounts of\n$102.50 and $1500.00 for a total monthly alimony income of $1602.50. (Pl.'s Ex. 7 at 100041.) SunTrust deemed\nboth sources of alimony income unverified under the above-quoted guidelines and thus did not consider them\nwhen deciding whether Sallion qualified for the loan.\nBank officials allegedly did not consider the smaller $102.50 payment because Sallion never remitted a copy of\nthe divorce decree. Sallion disagrees, stating she provided Wittler with a copy of the divorce decree \"[a]t some\npoint during the application process.\" (Sallion Aff. ยถ 8.) While a factual dispute exists as to whether SunTrust ever\nreceived the decree, Sallion does not allege SunTrust's policy of requiring the decree for verification is\ndiscriminatory, and the decision to deem the $102.50 monthly income unverified is therefore irrelevant to the\npresent analysis.\nSunTrust classified the $1500 monthly income as unverified because Sallion could not substantiate receipt of\npayment for one year as SunTrust's underwriting guidelines require; Sallion did not receive her first payment\nunder the 1994 divorce decree until April 1994 and thus could only substantiate receipt of payment for two\nmonths. Sallion alleges this proof of payment requirement is a \"rigid rule[]\" that SunTrust \"does not impose on\nother forms of income.\" The only evidence offered in support of this allegation, however, are three instances\nwhen SunTrust approved loan applications despite the applicant's recent commencement of employment with a\nnew employer. (Resp.Br. at 21.) No reasonable juror could review this evidence in addition to the remainder of\nthe record and conclude SunTrust maintained a policy of discriminating against divorcees.\nSallion never mentions the fact SunTrust imposes this same receipt-of-payment requirement on loan applicants\nwho receive every type of income not considered to be wages or salary. Indeed, loan applicants must confirm\nreceipt of payment for (1) at least three years for income derived from notes or mortgages, (2) at least two years\nfor income from interest, dividends, and trusts, or tips, and (3) at least one year for income from social security\ndisability, retirement, interest, and dividends. (Pl.'s Ex. 11 at 285-87.) Because SunTrust consistently imposes\nproof-of-receipt requirements in these more analogous areas of income, no reasonable juror could find\nSunTrust's alimony verifications requirements are discriminatory based on the sole fact employment income is\nsubject to more lenient verification standards.\nB. Circumstantial Evidence of Racial and Marital Status\nDiscrimination\nBoth parties agree the Court should utilize the McDonnell-Douglas framework to analyze the propriety of\n1329 SunTrust's decision to deny Sallion's loan application. When adjusted to fit the context of the *1329 case sub\njudice, the framework is as follows:\n[Sallion] must first make out a prima facie case by showing: \"1) that [s]he is a member of a\nprotected class; 2) that [s]he applied for and was qualified for a loan from the defendant; 3) that\nthe loan was rejected despite h[er] qualifications; and 4) that the defendant continued to approve\nloans for applicants with qualifications similar to the plaintiffs.\" Milton v. Bancplus Mortgage Corp.,\nNo. 96 C 106, 1996 WL 197532 *2 (N.D.Ill. April 19, 1996) (citations omitted). Once the plaintiff\nmakes the prima facie case, the burden \"shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason for taking the action it did against plaintiff.\" Sayers v. General Motors\nAcceptance Corp., 522 F.Supp. 835, 840 (W.D.Mo.1981); See Thomas, Defending an ECOA\nClaim, at 112 (same). Finally, if the lender comes forward with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nreason for denying the applicant credit, the applicant then must show that these reasons are just a\npretext for discrimination. See Saldana [v. Citibank], No. 93 C 4164, 1996 WL 332451 * 3\n(Applicant may still prevail is she can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a\ndiscriminatory reason more likely motivated the bank or that the bank's proffered explanation is\nunworthy of credence or is a pretext for discrimination.)\nAB & S Auto Serv., Inc. v. South Shore Bank of Chicago, 962 F.Supp. 1056, 1060 n. 6 (N.D.Ill.1997).\n\nThe problem, however, is this analysis focuses almost exclusively on the question whether the applicant was\nqualified for the loan. This is because banks presumably loan money to all applicants who qualify, unlike\nemployers who usually make their selection from a host of qualified candidates. Consequently, by proving\nqualification for the loan, an ECOA plaintiff satisfies the second element of the prima facie case and, at the same\ntime, casts sufficient doubt on the bank's proffered legitimate reason that he or she was not qualified.\nRegardless of the terms in which it is couched, the undisputed evidence in the case sub judice reveals Sallion\nwas not qualified for the loan. In addition, the evidence does not support a finding SunTrust treated similarly\nsituated loan applicants who are not members of the protected classes more favorably. Sallion has therefore\nfailed to satisfy elements two and four of her prima facie case and, at the same time, has failed to either cast\nsufficient doubt on SunTrust's proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons or show a discriminatory reason\nmore likely motivated SunTrust to reject her loan.\n1. SunTrust's Proffered Explanation\nSunTrust has presented evidence detailed in part one of this Order that it rejected Sallion's loan application of\n$132,250 not because of her race or marital status but, instead, because she was unqualified due to (1)\ninsufficient verifiable income, (2) an unacceptable debt to income ratio, (3) delinquent credit obligations, and (4)\ninsufficient closing funds. (Pl.'s Ex. 7 at 100001-003.) Reasonable jurors could not, after reviewing the record,\ndisagree with SunTrust's conclusion Sallion was not qualified for the loan. Sallion has thus failed to satisfy prong\ntwo of her prima facie case and failed to cast sufficient doubt on SunTrust's legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nreasons.\na. Insufficient Verifiable Income. The Court has already concluded SunTrust's verification policy for alimony\nincome is not discriminatory, see supra pp. 1327-28, and it is undisputed Sallion's monthly income was\ninsufficient absent the unverified alimony income of $1500 per month.\nb. Unacceptable Debt to Income Ratio. There is no colorable argument Sallion even came close to satisfying\nSunTrust's loan ratio requirements; instead, the undisputed evidence reveals Sallion's loan ratios alone\ndisqualified her for the loan. When both the $1500 alimony income and the $102.32 alimony income are removed\n1330 *1330 from consideration, Sallion's mortgage payment ratio is 52.6% and her total debt ratio is 64.6%, (Pl.'s Ex.\n10), which exceeds SunTrust's target ratios of 28% and 36% by a colossal margin. Adding the $102.32 monthly\nalimony payment to Sallion's income, and thus assuming it is verifiable, only decreases the ratios to 50% and\n59%. (See Pl.'s Ex. 7 at 100003.)\nThere is no evidence to suggest any loan applicant similarly situated in terms of front and back ratios received\nloan approval from SunTrust. Of the nineteen loan files Sallion has submitted, SunTrust approved no loans with a\nfront ratio of 50% or more (the highest is 38%), and approved only one loan from a white male applicant with a\nback ratio of 59% or more. (See Resp.Br. at 14-16.) But there exists no substantial similarity between Sallion and\nthat applicant because (1) his front ratio was 38% as compared to Sallion's 50%, (2) SunTrust conditioned loan\napproval upon the applicant paying off a debt that accounted for $300 of his monthly expenses, and (3) SunTrust\ninitially qualified the applicant based on a monthly income calculated using a future raise, which decreased the\nback ratio to 37.8%; when a bank official realized this, she ordered another official to \"[c]ontact co-borrower for\nemployment info and verify....\" (Pl.'s Ex. 34.)\nSallion complains the underwriters did not take into consideration the tax-exempt nature of her retirement income\nwhen calculating her loan ratios, which SunTrust's underwriting guidelines permits. (Pl.'s Ex. 11 at 284). She also\npoints out that SunTrust took this factor into account for at least one white borrower. (Resp.Br. at 5.) This\nevidence neither suggests a discriminatory motive nor proves Sallion was qualified for the loan. First, there is no\nevidence Sallion ever informed bank officials of the tax-exempt nature of her retirement income, and nothing in\nthe record suggests bank officials should have discovered this fact on their own from the face of Sallion's\napplication. Reasonable jurors could therefore only speculate that the underwriters knew this fact but chose to\nignore it in an effort to disguise their discriminatory rejection of her application. Second, Sallion has not provided\nthe Court with either (1) the amount of tax savings that should have been added to her gross monthly income for\n\nunderwriting purposes or (2) the adjusted loan ratios based upon said adjusted gross income figure. Absent this\ninformation, the Court cannot discern whether the adjusted loan ratios would have compared favorably with\napplicants outside the protected classes who received loan approval.\nc. Delinquent Credit Obligations. Because SunTrust's second denial of credit to Sallion stated Sallion's credit\nhistory did not influence the underwriters' decision to reject the loan, reasonable jurors could find this proffered\nreason did not play a role in SunTrust's decision.\nd. Insufficient Closing Funds. Sallion admits she did not have sufficient, readily-available funds to close, but\nargues (1) SunTrust should have approved her for a smaller loan for which her funds would have been sufficient\nto close, (2) since she lacked only $650, the bank should have notified her it would approve the loan application if\nshe raised the needed funds, and (3) SunTrust should have asked Sallion to cash in her life insurance policy or\ndemand repayment from her son of a $3000 loan in order to raise the needed funds.\nAs to the first argument, the Court has concluded no evidence in the record suggests SunTrust ever approves\nloans for less than the specific amount stated on the application. See infra p. 1331. The second and third\ncontentions are unpersuasive because SunTrust would not have approved the loan even if Sallion raised the\nadditional funds because of her unacceptable loan ratios.\n2. No Similarly-Situated Applicants Approved\nSallion has also failed to satisfy prong four of her prima facie case because she has not established SunTrust\n1331 approved *1331 the loan application of any similarly situated applicant who is not a member of the protected\nclasses. To establish substantial similarity, Sallion does not have to find an exact match between her application\nand applicants outside the protected classes who received loans, but comparator loan files must be significantly\nparallel in every material respect. See Jones v. Bessemer Carraway Medical Center, 137 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th\nCir.1998) (citation omitted) (plaintiff must show comparators are \"similarly situated in all relevant respects. ...\").\nSallion never offers a thorough comparison but, instead, presents only snapshots of comparator loan files in an\nattempt to create a sense of substantial similarity where none really exists. (Resp.Br. at 14-16; Reply Br. at 11-14;\nPl.'s Exs. 24-42.)\n3. Attempt to Show Discriminatory Reason More Likely Motivated the\nDecision\nOnce a plaintiff has satisfied all of the prima facie elements, she may establish pretext either \"directly by\npersuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that\nthe employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\" Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519,\n1528 (11th Cir.1997),cert. denied,522 U.S. 1045, 118 S.Ct. 685, 139 L.Ed.2d 632 (1998) (quoting Texas Dep't.\nof Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1095, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)). Because\nreasonable jurors could not find Sallion was qualified for the loan, Sallion obviously cannot satisfy the prima facie\nelements of her case or establish pretext indirectly by showing SunTrust's proffered reasons are unworthy of\nbelief. But even if one assumes Sallion could get past the prima facie elements, the Court also finds no evidence\nto support a finding that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated SunTrust's rejection of the loan application.\nSallion attempts to show a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the decision by alleging SunTrust acted\nout of the ordinary when it rejected the loan application for $132,250 instead of qualifying Sallion for some\nunspecified, lower amount more suitable to her financial profile. According to Sallion, SunTrust's failure to do so\nwould lead a factfinder to only one conclusion: SunTrust did not want to qualify her for a loan because of her race\nand marital status. Having reviewed the evidence Sallion presents in support of this allegation, the Court\nconcludes no reasonable juror could find this contention to be true.\nSallion argues the bank should have qualified her for an unspecified amount less than $132,250 because Sallion\ninformed Wittler she simply wanted to know the highest loan amount for which she could qualify. While Sallion's\ndeposition testimony regarding this matter is confusing, the following two points are clear: (1) Sallion understood\n\nWittler had to choose a specific loan amount for the underwriters to consider; and (2) Sallion did not object when\nWittler informed her the loan application would be submitted in the amount of $132,250. (Sallion Dep. at\n107-108.) In addition, there is no indication Sallion ever asked Wittler to reduce the loan amount, even after the\nbank denied her application the first and second times.\nSallion implies SunTrust acted out of the ordinary by failing to go outside the requested loan amount to determine\nthe highest amount for which Sallion could qualify. But Plaintiff has presented no evidence to suggest SunTrust\never operates in this manner, and the record contains ample evidence to suggest otherwise. Indeed, every\nSunTrust loan file Sallion has presented to the Court lists a specific loan amount for which the applicant sought\nqualification, and in every instance the underwriters did not stray from the requested loan amount by offering\nunsolicited statements regarding the loan applicants' qualification for a lesser amount. Indeed, only one loan file\n1332 in the record evidences approval for a loan amount less than what the application originally requested, but *1332\nthat occurred because the loan applicant reduced the loan amount by $13,000 and resubmitted the loan\napplication after being denied the first time. (Pl.'s Ex. 26.)\nC. Claim Against Wittler\nAlthough Sallion testified Wittler appeared \"truthful, honest, and very up front\" during the time they worked\ntogether on the loan application, (Sallion Dep. at 89-90), Sallion now claims Wittler \"extended more assistance or\nadvocacy to prospective borrowers of one race than another.\" (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Facts ยถ 11.) But the five\ncriticisms of Wittler's performance Sallion offers to support this claim offer no basis for a finding Wittler\nmaintained such a discriminatory policy or, more importantly, that Wittler applied the policy to Sallion and treated\nher less favorably than white applicants.\nFirst, Sallion blames Wittler for submitting the loan application for $132,250 and not explaining to the underwriters\n\"that the amount of money the plaintiff sought was flexible.\" (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Facts ยถ 10.) But as explained\nabove, SunTrust did not stray from the specific loan amount listed on the application in an attempt to qualify\napplicants who would otherwise be rejected for smaller amounts.\nSecond, Sallion alleges Wittler \"drafted a memorandum regarding [her] loan application for the underwriters\nwhich contains information that is simply false and that undermined her loan application.\" (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.'\nFacts ยถ 10.) At her deposition, Sallion expressed disagreement with dates and facts Wittler recounted in a\nmemorandum to SunTrust underwriters, but no reasonable juror could find the discrepancies material to Sallion's\nloan application. (Sallion Dep. at 92-97; Pl.'s Ex. 8 at 20045.) Nor could the memorandum and Sallion's testimony\nprovide sufficient basis for a jury determination that Wittler intentionally offered a lower level of service to Sallion\nbecause of her race.\nThird, Sallion alleges Wittler \"failed to advise the underwriters of several factors present in [her] application which\nhad been used to compensate for high ratios in applications submitted by white applicants.\" (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.'\nFacts ยถ 10.) But the six factors Sallion proceeds to list are facts readily ascertainable from the face of Sallion's\napplication. In addition, there is no evidence Wittler ever took the time to highlight favorable portions of\napplications submitted by loan applicants outside the protected classes. Indeed, the record contains no evidence\ndescribing to any extent the level of services Wittler provided other loan applicants outside the protected classes.\nFourth, Sallion faults Wittler for not suggesting she could resubmit Sallion's application after Sallion had received\nthe $1500 alimony payment for twelve months. (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Facts ยถ 10.) But Sallion cannot escape the\nfact there is no evidence Wittler advised white applicants of every obvious scenario for obtaining qualification.\nFinally, Sallion relies on a test performed by a local agency whereby two people (one white and one black) posed\nas prospective loan applicants, approached Wittler, and asked her questions regarding SunTrust mortgages.\nWittler allegedly treated the black applicant less favorably by, for example, grabbing her hand only by the\nfingertips during their handshake and referring her almost immediately to a course for first-time home buyers.\n(Pl.'s Ex. 43.) Setting aside the subjective nature of the test and its inherent unreliability, the results do nothing to\nestablish Wittler treated Sallion less favorably than white applicants during the application process.\n\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the Court concludes reasonable jurors could not find Defendants discriminated\nagainst Plaintiff on the basis of her race or marital status either in the provision of services or in the determination\n1333 Plaintiff was not qualified for a loan. Defendants' Motion for *1333 Summary Judgment [39-1] is therefore\nGRANTED.\n[1] Over ten years ago the Supreme Court instructed courts to apply Title VII's \"carefully designed framework of\nproof\" in the context of section 1981 discrimination claims. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 109\nS.Ct. 2363, 2377-2378, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989). Courts within the Eleventh Circuit have applied the McDonnell-\nDouglas burden shifting analysis to analyze section 1982 claims. See Farrior v. H.J. Russell & Co., 45 F.Supp.2d\n1358, 1367 (N.D.Ga.1999); Bell v. Mike Ford Realty Co., 857 F.Supp. 1550 (S.D.Ala.1994). Courts also use this\nframework of proof to resolve claims of discrimination under the ECOA. See Moore v. United States Dep't of\nAgric., 55 F.3d 991, 994 (5th Cir.1995) (implying McDonnell-Douglas framework would apply but for fact plaintiffs\npresented direct evidence of discrimination); Mercado-Garcia v. Ponce Federal Bank, 979 F.2d 890, 893 (1st\nCir.1992) (applying McDonnell-Douglas framework to ECOA claim); but see Latimore v. Citibank Federal Savings\nBank, 151 F.3d 712, 713-15 (7th Cir. 1998) (concluding McDonnell-Douglas should not be applied in ECOA\ncontext).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
