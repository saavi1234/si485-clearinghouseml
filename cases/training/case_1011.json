    "summary": "<p>On January 17, 1989, residents of T.B. Watkins Homes, a public housing development operated by the Housing Authority of Kansas City, Missouri, filed a class-action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the State of Missouri in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated by racial discrimination in the provision of public housing.  Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court for an injunction to prevent the defendants from demolishing the T.B. Watkins Homes.  </p><p>On January 3, 1990, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri (Judge Dean Whipple) certified the plaintiffs as a class, holding that they had a private cause of action under the U.S. Housing Act section regulating demolitions, and that they had established a prima facie Title VIII claim.  Tinsley v. Kemp, 750 F.Supp. 1001 (W.D.Mo. 1990).</p><p>On November 21, 1991, the parties entered into a Consent Decree, under which the defendants agreed to a comprehensive modernization and rehabilitation of the T.B. Watkins Homes.  They agreed to transform the development into safe, decent, and sanitary housing, without any loss of units, to remain viable for at least twenty additional years.  The development was to also see improvements in the areas of the playground, park areas, landscaping, outside lighting, and security.  </p><p>On July 6, 1993, the District Court (Judge Whipple) appointed Robert E. Larson to be the Special Master for the case.  On January 22, 1993, the District Court held the defendants in contempt for failure to comply with the Consent Decree, ordering them to pay $86,000 as well as the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.  </p><p>For the next ten years, the parties continued to quibble over the specific terms of the Consent Decree.  On October 4, 2004, the District Court ordered them to begin working on a decree.  </p><p>According to the PACER docket, which is accurate as of 01/12/2007, the District Court continues to oversee the case and is currently awaiting the parties' new Consent Decree proposal.  </p><p></p>",

Watkins Homes, (T.B.\nWatkins), a public housing development operated by defendants,\nHousing Authority of Kansas City, Missouri, and Mike Fisher\n(hereinafter referred to collectively as \"HAKC\"), and on behalf\nof all applicants to public housing operated by HAKC who have\nbeen placed on a waiting list for public housing.\n1.  Plaintiffs are automatically substituting the name of Jack L.\nKemp as Secretary of HUD pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d)(l).\n\n2.  Plaintiffs who are residents of T.B.  Watkins and the \nclass they represent are living in substandard conditions.  Over \nthe years, HAKC  has failed to respond to plaintiffsf requests for \nrepairs.  As a result, the units are frequently in a state of \ndisrepair, and at all times relevant hereto, the common areas of \nthe buildings at T.B.  Watkins have been dilapidated and \ndangerous. \n3.  Currently, there are approximately 118 vacancies at T.B. \nWatkins out of 288 units.  HAKC  has boarded up most of these 118 \nvacant units.  However, they have not been properly secured. \nTrespassers and drug dealers have entered many of these vacant \nunits and have threatened and frightened the residents of T.B. \nWatkins. \n4.  HAKC  has taken little action to protect the residents of \nT.B.  Watkins.  Moreover, HAKC  has taken no action to repair and \nmake occqiable the 118 vacant units. \n5.  This complaint is also filed on behalf of applicants to \npublic housing who have been placed on a waiting list.  Some of \nthese applicants are living in overcrowded conditions.  Some are \nhomeless,  Many of these applicants would not be waiting for low- \nincome busing if HAKC  had performed its duties and made the nec- \nessary repairs to ready the vacant units for occupancy. \n6.  Plaintiffs seek an order requiring HAKC  to immediately \nrepair and make occupiable all of the units at T.B.  Watkins. \nPlaintiffs also seek an order requiring HAKC  to immediately fill \nall vacant units after said units have been made occupiable. \nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin defendants from causing the deteriora- \n\ntion and de facto demolition of T.B. Watkins.  Plaintiffs\nchallenge defendants' actions as violative of 42 U.S.C. § l437p,\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, and the Annual Contributions\nContract entered into by defendants HAKC, HUD and Kemp.\nPlaintiffs also challenge defendants' actions as violative of\nTitle VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et\nseq. and Title VI 42, U.S.C. § 2OOOd et seq. because their\nactions discriminate against and have an adverse impact upon the\nnonwhite residents of T.B. Watkins and the nonwhite applicants\nfor public housing.\nII.  JURISDICTION\n7.

Kemp is the Secretary of the United\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in Wash-\nington, D.C.  Defendant Kemp is sued in his official capacity.\nHis presence in this action is necessary and indispensable for\nthe provision of the relief requested by the plaintiffs.\n20.  Defendant HUD is the federal administrative agency re-\nsponsible for fulfilling its statutory obligations, duties, and\nresponsibilities under the Housing Act.  Defendant HUD, is also\nresponsible for implementing and enforcing any of its regulations\npromulgated to effectuate its statutory responsibilities.\n21.

CLASS ACTION REQUIREMENTS\n23.  The named plaintiffs bring this suit individually and,\npursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, on behalf of a class consisting of all residents of\nT.B. Watkins and all applicants for public housing operated by\nHAKC who have been placed on a waiting list for public housing.\n24.  The requirements of Rule 23 are met in that the class,\nupon information and belief, consists of more than one hundred\nseventy (170) residents of T.B. Watkins and more than one\nthousand fifty (1050) applicants for public housing operated by\ndefendant HAKC who have been placed on a waiting list.  The class\nis so numerous that joinder is impracticable.  There are ques-\ntions of law and fact common to the class including whether de-\nfendant HAKC's failure to repair and maintain T.B. Watkins vio-\nlates rights secured to plaintiffs and all class members; the\nclaims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the\nclass; the named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class; and the defendants have acted and re-\n\nfused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,\nthereby making appropriate final injunctive and declaratory\nrelief with respect to the class as a whole.\nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND\n25.  The Housing Act was intended to provide a remedy for the\nshortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for low-income\nindividuals.  This legislation, in pertinent part, authorizes a\nvariety of federal subsidies to Public Housing Authorities\n(\"PHAs\") to assist in the development and operation of housing\nprojects.\n26.  The national housing goal was affirmed in the Housing\nand Community Development Act of 1968, 12 U.S.C. § ,l7Olt, which\nstated that the goal of \"a decent home and a suitable living en-\nvironment for every American family\" had not been fully \"realized\nfor many of the Nation's lower income families; that this is a\nmatter of grave national concern; and that there exist in the\npublic and private sectors of the economy the resources and capa-\nbilities necessary to the full realization of this goal.\"\nCongress went on to provide that:\nThe Congress declares that in the administration of those\nhousing programs authorized by this Act which are designed\nto assist families with incomes so low that they could not\notherwise decently house themselves, and of other Government\nprograms designed to assist in the provision of housing for\nsuch families, the highest priority and emphasis should be\ngiven to meeting the housing needs of those families for\nwhich the national goal has not become a reality; and in the\ncarrying out of such programs there should be the fullest\npracticable utilization of the resources and capabilities of\nprivate enterprise and of individual self-help techniques.\n27.  The Federal Government, through the mechanism of the An-\nnual Contributions Contract  (ACC), to which a PHA is a party, has\n\nthe authority to make annual contributions to subsidize the cost\nof operating and managing low-income public housing projects.  42\nU.S.C. §§ 14 37c and g.  The operation of each local PHA is sub-\nject to extensive regulation by HUD including, but not limited\nto, the following areas:  admission requirements, 24 C.F.R. part\n960; maintenance and operation, 24 C.F.R. part 965; lease and\ngrievance procedures, 24 C.F.R. part 966; energy conservation and\nutilities, 24 C.F.R. part 965; and the demolition and disposition\nof public housing units or projects, 24 C.F.R. part 970.\n28.  The Secretary of HUD is authorized to assist in the fi-\nnancing of the construction, acquisition and operation of low-\nrent housing developments on behalf of low-income individuals and\nfamilies by a PHA such as HAKC.  42 U.S.C. § 1437b.\n29.  The demolition or disposition of a public housing pro-\nject or unit is covered under 42 U.S.C. § l437p.  In 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1437p(a), the Secretary of HUD may not approve an application\nby a public housing authority for demolition or disposition un-\nless the Secretary determines that:\n(1) in the case of an application proposing demolition of a\npublic housing project or a portion of a public housing pro-\nject, the project or portion of the project is obsolete as\nto physical condition, location, or other factors, making it\nunusable for housing purposes and no reasonable program of\nmodification is feasible to return the project or portion of\nthe project to useful life; or in the case of an application\nproposing the demolition of only a portion of a project, the\ndemolition will help to assure the useful life of the re-\nmaining portion of the project; . . ..  (Emphasis added).\n30.  The statute continues to define specific requirements\nthat must be met before an application for demolition can be\napproved:\n8\n\n(b)  The Secretary may not approve an application or furnish\nassistance under this section or under this Act unless—\n(1)  the application from the public housing agency has\nbeen developed in consultation with tenants and tenant\ncouncils, if any, who will be affected by the demoli-\ntion or disposition and contains a certification by ap-\npropriate local government officials that the proposed\nactivity is consistent with the applicable housing as-\nsistance plan;\n(2)  all tenants to be displaced as a result of the de-\nmolition or disposition will be given assistance by the\npublic housing agency and are relocated to other de-\ncent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, which is,\nto the maximum extent practicable, housing of their\nchoice, including housing assisted under Section 8 of\nthis Act; and\n(3) the public housing agency has developed a plan for\nthe provision of an additional decent, safe, sanitary,\nand affordable dwelling  unit for each public housing\ndwelling unit to be demolished or disposed under such\napplication which plan—\n(A)  provides for the provision of such additional\ndwelling units through-\n(i) the acquisition or development of additional\npublic housing dwelling units;\n(ii)  the use of 15-year project-based assistance\nunder Section 8;\n(iii) the use of not less than 15-year project-\nbased assistance under other Federal programs;\n(iv) the acquisition or development of dwelling\nunits assisted under a State or local government\nprogram that provides for project-based assistance\ncomparable in terms of eligibility, contribution\nto rent, and length of assistance contract (not\nless than 15 years) to assistance under Section\n8(b)(l);\n(v) the use of 15-year tenant-based assistance un-\nder Section 8 (excluding vouchers under Section\n8(o); or\n(vi) any combination of such methods;\nUnder 42 U.S.C. § l437p(d), a public housing agency \"shall\nnot take any action to demolish or dispose of a public housing\n\nproject or a portion of a public housing project without obtain-\ning the approval of the Secretary and satisfying the conditions\nspecified in subsections (a) and (b).\"\n(Emphasis added).\n31.  Title 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) makes it unlawful to \"refuse\nto sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, . ..  or\notherwise make unavailable or deny a dwelling to any person be-\ncause of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\"\n32.  Title 42 U.S.C. § 3608(d) states that \"[a]ll executive\ndepartments and agencies shall administer their programs and ac-\ntivities relating to housing and urban development in a manner\naffirmatively to further the purposes of this title and shall co-\noperate with the Secretary to further such purposes.\"\n33.  Title 42 U.S.C. § 2OOO(d) provides that:  •'[n]o person\nin the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or\nnational origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program\nor activity receiving federal financial assistance.\"\nFACTUAL STATEMENT\n34.  Plaintiffs Doletha Tinsley, Corine Batts, Bertha Doss,\nLorine Dawkins and Mary Vann are tenants of T.B. Watkins.  All of\ntheir units have had defective conditions at various times during\ntheir tenancy.  Frequently, their requests for repairs have been\nignored by HAKC.  When repairs have been made, they have usually\nbeen made improperly by unskilled maintenance workers.\n35.  Although these plaintiffs have had individual habit-\nability problems with their units, the more serious risk of harm\n10\n\nto plaintiffs and their children comes from the dangerous condi-\ntions in the common areas of each building at T.B. Watkins and\nthe existence of 118 vacant units among the 288 total units at\nthe project.\n36.  The vacant units have exposed plaintiffs and the class\nthey represent to drug dealers, arsonists and trespassers.\nThese vacant units have not been properly secured by HAKC thereby\nenabling trespassers and drug dealers to enter the units and in-\nhabit them.  These units have become dilapidated and uninhabit-\nable due to HAKC's failure to repair the units as repairs were\nneeded.  As a result, these vacant units are unoccupiable and\nhave been left unsecured.  Many of these units have been stripped\nof window frames, appliances, cabinets and countertops.  They are\nfull of trash and infested with rats and insects.\n37.  The legitimate residents of T.B. Watkins are fearful for\ntheir lives.  They are frequently exposed to open drug dealing in\nthe vacant units and in the hallways of their buildings.  The\ncommon areas are full of trash, human waste, broken glass and\nfilth.  Many of the windows in the common areas are broken.  The\nbuildings are unsecured and dangerous.\n38.  Since May, 1988 the number of vacancies at T.B. Watkins\nhas increased from 35 to 118 units.  The vacancies at T.B.\nWatkins are growing at an astonishing rate.\n39.  HAKC has a history of failing to make repairs to its\npublic housing units and buildings to such an extent that build-\nings at T.B. Watkins and other public housing projects have been\ndemolished.\n11\n\n40.  In 1983, T.B. Watkins had 348 units.  HAKC requested the\ndemolition of 48 units \"because of the delay in making relatively\nsimple repairs.\" Fiscal Year 1983 Comprehensive Improvement\nAssistance Program Preliminary Application Narrative, p. 12.\nHAKC felt that it would be more cost effective to demolish the\nunits than to rehabilitate them at $4,500.00 per unit. Id.\n41.  Defendants HUD and Pierce approved the demolition of\nthese 48 units to be funded under the Fiscal Year 1984 Comprehen-\nsive Improvement Assistance Program  (CIAP).  Consequently T.B.\nWatkins went from 348 units to 300 units.\n42.  In 1984, HAKC again requested permission from HUD to\ndemolish 12 units at T.B. Watkins due to poor maintenance and\nsubstandard conditions.  Again, Defendants HUD and Pierce ap-\nproved the demolition and T.B. Watkins was reduced from 300 units\nto 288 units.\n43.  HAKC is fully aware that its failure to make repairs and\nto remedy defective conditions has caused the de facto demolition\nof the affected units and buildings at T.B. Watkins.\n44.  In the summer of 1988, HUD assigned a member of its\nstaff to be officed full-time at the central office of HAKC in\norder to oversee and monitor HAKC's management and operation of\nits public housing projects.\n45.  HUD has refused to take any action to force HAKC to\nremedy the defects and rehabilitate the vacant units at T.B.\nWatkins.  Additionally, HUD has recently refused to grant funds\nfor the rehabilitation of T.B. Watkins.\n12\n\n46.  Currently, 99% of the residents at T.B. Watkins are\n¿·—¯  '—  .  -—•\nnonwhite.  Historically, T.B. Watkins has been predominately\noccupied by nonwhites.\n,  -  —  -  '\n47.  All of the plaintiffs are nonwhite.  The de facto\ndemolition of T.B. Watkins has a greater adverse effect upon non-\nwhite people than upon white people.\n48.  Currently there are approximately 1,050 people on a\nwaiting list to get into public housing.  Plaintiff Linda Robin-\nson is one of those persons.\n49.  The waiting list for public housing operated by defen-\ndant HAKC contains a larger percentage of nonwhite applicants\nthan white applicants.\n50.  Most people on the waiting list for public housing are\neither living in substandard or overcrowded conditions, facing\neviction because of their inability to pay the rent or are  home-\nless.\n51.  Plaintiff Linda Robinson has lived in various shelters\nand is currently living with ten other people in a three bedroom\nhouse.\n52.  There are approximately 12,000 homeless people in the\nKansas City, Missouri metropolitan area.\n53.  HAKC has a pattern and practice of deferring\nmaintenance until units and buildings are beyond repair, thereby\nleading to demolition.\n54.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent have been in-\njured by defendants' de facto demolition of T.B. Watkins.\n13\n\n55.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent will be ir-\nreparably harmed if HAKC is not enjoined from taking any further\nsteps to demolish units at T.B. Watkins.\n56.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent will be ir-\nreparably harmed if HAKC and HUD are not enjoined from deferring\nor neglecting to perform necessary maintenance and rehabilitation\nof all the units and common areas at T.B. Watkins.\n57.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent will be ir-\nreparably harmed if HAKC, HUD and Kemp are not enjoined from\ntaking any action concerning T.B. Watkins that will have a dis-\ncriminatory impact on plaintiffs and their class.\n58.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nCOUNT I\n(42 U.S.C. § 1983 against HAKC)\n59.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if\nfully pled herein paragraphs 1 through 58 of their Complaint.\n60.  Defendants, Housing Authority of Kansas City, Missouri\nand Mike Fisher are each \"persons\" within the meaning of that\nterm as it is used in 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n61.  Defendant HAKC has failed to maintain and properly man-\nage T.B. Watkins to such an extent that many of its occupied\nunits are in disrepair and the 118 unoccupied vacant units are\ndilapidated and unfit for occupancy.\n62.  HAKC has failed to preserve the 118 vacant units by\nfailing to repair and maintain these units in decent, safe and\nsanitary condition and by removing tenants from certain units.\n14\n\n63.  HAKC's actions have caused the 118 vacant units at T.B.\nWatkins to become unoccupiable and have created a de facto demo-\nlition of these units.\n64.  The Housing Act requires that HAKC before undertaking\nany action, including the omission or failure to act, that would\nresult in the destruction or demolition of any existing T.B.\nWatkins unit, must secure approval from defendants Kemp and HUD.\n42 U.S.C. § l437p.  Such approval shall not be given un-less\ncertain conditions have been met, including the submission of an\napplication that has been \"developed in consultation with tenants\n. . . who will be affected by the demolition or disposi-tion . .\n.\",  42 U.S.C. § l437p(b)(l), and provides that \"all tenants to\nbe displaced as a result of the demolition or disposi-tion will\nbe given assistance by the public housing agency and are\nrelocated to other decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing,\nwhich is, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their\nchoice . . ..  \" 42 U.S.C. § l437p(b)(2).\n65.  HAKC has not consulted with tenants regarding the future\nof T.B. Watkins and has not developed their plans after consulta-\ntion with tenants.\n66.  HAKC has failed to provide adequate relocation assis-\ntance and has not developed a plan for relocation of displaced\ntenants.\n67.  The actions and omissions of HAKC under color of state\nlaw deprived plaintiffs and the class they represent of the\n15\n\nrights they enjoy under 42 U.S.C. § l437p.\nCOUNT II\n(Civil Remedy Against Kemp and HUD)\n68.

The actions of defendants HUD and Kemp have caused a de  <-¿,\nfacto demolition without meeting the statutory and regulatory\nrequirements.\n72.

U.S.\nAtty., Kansas City, Mo., for defendants.\nORDER\nWHIPPLE, District Judge.\nIn this action, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief in equity, but not damages. Five motions are\npending:\n1. Plaintiffs filed a motion on January 31, 1989, seeking an order determining that this matter\n1003 should be maintained as a class action. Defendants Mike Fisher *1003 and Housing Authority of\nKansas City filed a memorandum in opposition on April 17, 1989. Plaintiffs filed a reply on April 27,\n1989. The motion will be granted, and a class will be certified to seek equitable relief.\n2. Defendants United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and Jack L. Kemp,\nsecretary of the department (hereinafter, those two defendants collectively are \"HUD\") filed a\nmotion on May 23, 1989, to dismiss this action. Plaintiffs filed suggestions in opposition on June\n28, 1989, and HUD filed a reply on July 27, 1989. Plaintiffs submitted supplemental suggestions in\nopposition on October 19, 1989. The motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n3. HUD filed, on October 30, 1989, a motion to strike plaintiffs' supplemental suggestions or, in the\nalternative, for leave to file a limited response. Plaintiffs filed suggestions in opposition to the\nmotion on November 1, 1989. The motion will be denied in part, in that the supplemental\nsuggestions will not be stricken. However, the motion will be granted in part in that HUD's limited\nresponse will be considered.\n4. HUD filed a motion on August 8, 1989, to stay discovery pending a ruling on the motion to\ndismiss. Plaintiffs filed their opposition on August 29, 1989. HUD replied on September 8, 1989.\nThe motion will be denied as moot.\n5. Plaintiffs filed a motion on December 6, 1989, to compel production of documents. HUD filed\nopposition on December 21, 1989. The motion will be granted.\nI. STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nFive plaintiffs are residents of T.B. Watkins Homes (\"Watkins Homes\"), a public housing project in Kansas City,\nMissouri. The sixth plaintiff is a homeless applicant who has been on a waiting list for public housing since April\n1988.\n\nDefendants Housing Authority of Kansas City, Missouri, and Michael Fisher, the authority's executive director\n(hereinafter, these two defendants collectively are \"HAKC\"), operate Watkins Homes. HAKC is a public housing\nauthority which administers federally subsidized and assisted low-rent housing programs as authorized by the\nUnited States Housing Act of 1937 (\"Housing Act\"). HUD is a federal agency with statutory obligations, duties,\nand responsibilities under the Housing Act. HUD also is responsible for implementing and enforcing regulations\npromulgated to effectuate statutory responsibilities.\nPlaintiffs allege essentially that defendants are permitting deterioration of residential units at the Watkins Homes\nwhich, in effect, is illegal demolition of the units. This passive sort of de facto demolition results in fewer units\navailable to applicants, and a lower quality housing project for the residents, plaintiffs allege. Plaintiffs primarily\nseek declaratory judgment and an injunction to prevent the alleged de facto demolition. They seek no money\ndamages.\nPlaintiffs seek relief under a variety of theories. Their claims:\n(1) Violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by HAKC (constitutional rights claim),\n(2) Violation of Housing Act provisions by HUD (implied cause of action under Section 18(d) of the\nHousing Act [42 U.S.C. § 1437p] and 24 C.F.R. Part 970),\n(3) Commission of an administrative legal wrong by HUD for which there is redress under 5 U.S.C.\n§ 702 (Administrative Procedures Act, or \"APA\", claim),\n(4) Breach of contract by HUD and HAKC (third-party beneficiary claim),\n(5) Discriminatory impact of violations of Housing Act by HAKC and HUD (Title VIII claim under\nFair Housing Act of 1968 [42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) and 3608(d)]),\n(6) Facially discriminatory impact of violations of Housing Act by HUD (another Title VIII claim),\nand\n(7) Discrimination against intended beneficiaries by HAKC and HUD for failure to maintain decent\nhousing (Title VI claim [42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.]).\n1004 [1]\n II. FACTS\n*1004\nAs a public housing authority (\"PHA\"), HAKC has an annual contributions contract (\"ACC\") with HUD to receive\nsubsidizing funds for operation and maintenance of low-income housing under the Housing Act. 42 U.S.C. §§\n1437c and 1437g. The PHA is subject to extensive regulation by HUD in numerous areas, including demolition\nand disposition of public housing units or projects. Procedures, limits and requirements for demolition and\ndisposition are set in 42 U.S.C. § 1437p.\nWatkins Homes had 348 residential units in 1983 when HAKC asked to demolish 48 units because of delay in\nmaking relatively simple repairs. Demolition would be less expensive than the rehabilitation cost of $4,500 per\nunit. HUD approved the demolition, reducing the number of units to 300. In 1984 HAKC asked to demolish 12\nmore units, due to poor maintenance and substandard conditions. With HUD's permission, the number of units\ndropped to 288.\nIn the summer of 1988, HUD assigned a staff member to be officed full-time at the HAKC central office to oversee\nand monitor HAKC's management and operation of public housing projects. HUD did not force HAKC to remedy\ndefects and rehabilitate vacant units, and did not grant funds for rehabilitation at Watkins Homes.\nOf the 288 remaining units, 118 are vacant. In May 1988, only 35 units were vacant. The vacant units are\nunsecured, uninhabitable, dilapidated, and open to trespassers, arsonists and drug dealers. The vermin-infested\nunits are full of trash. Many units are stripped of window frames, appliances, cabinets and counter tops. The\ncommon areas have broken windows, and are full of trash, human waste, and broken glass.\n\nLike 99% of Watkins Homes residents, all the plaintiffs are nonwhite. Five of the plaintiffs, as residents, suffer\nfrom their exposure to the deteriorated conditions of the vacant units. More than 170 persons reside in the\noccupied units at Watkins Homes.\nThe sixth plaintiff is one of the 1,050 persons waiting to enter public housing. More nonwhite persons than white\npersons are waiting. They are living in substandard and/or overcrowded conditions, are facing eviction for inability\nto pay rent, or are homeless. The sixth plaintiff is homeless and has four children. She has lived in various\nshelters, and currently is living with ten other persons in a three-bedroom house. She has applied for a unit at\nWatkins Homes.\nDespite the alleged de facto demolition of the 118 vacant units, HAKC has not consulted with tenants regarding\nthe future of Watkins Homes so it has not developed post-demolition plans after consultation with tenants. HAKC\nfurther has not provided adequate relocation assistance, and has not developed a relocation plan for displaced\ntenants.\nIII. THE MOTIONS\nA. Class Action\n1. Arguments\nPlaintiffs seek certification of a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), Fed. R.Civ.P. The class would include all\nresidents of Watkins Homes, and all applicants who have been put on a waiting list for HAKC-operated public\nhousing. They claim to have the four class characteristics required in Rule 23(a). They also contend the\ndefendants acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, and that injunctive and declarative relief is\nappropriate, so a class should be certified under Rule 23(b)(2).\nDefendant HAKC opposes certification on four grounds: (1) The relief, as a practical matter, would benefit\nproposed class members anyway, so certification is unnecessary. (2) The boundaries of the putative class have\nbeen defined inadequately. (3) Plaintiffs have not satisfied the characteristics required by Rule 23(a). (4) No\n1005 sufficient nexus has been shown between the class and liability, i.e., the proposed class *1005 has not been\nlimited to those harmed by defendants.\nPlaintiffs replied that Rule 23(b)(2) specifically provides for class certification where injunctive and declaratory\nrelief is sought. They raise four reasons why a class is necessary here. First, if a class is declared, plaintiffs\nargue, their claims could avoid premature mootness. (For instance, defendants merely could provide decent\nhousing only for the named plaintiffs, thereby making their claims moot before the issues are resolved.) Thus the\nrelief sought for other aggrieved parties could be obtained without litigating separately for each individual resident\nor applicant. Second, class status protects absent parties. Third, all class members subsequently can enforce\nrelief. Finally, broader class issues can be considered in formulating class-wide relief. Plaintiffs further argue that\nthe class definition is not too broad, that plaintiffs have standing, and that they have satisfied the Rule 23(a)\nrequirements.\n2. Discussion\nUnder Rule 23(a), parties may be representatives to sue or be sued of behalf of a class if:\n(1) [T]he class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions\nof law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.\nUnder Rule 23(b)(2), a class action may be maintained if the requirements listed above are met and if:\n\n(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the\nclass, thereby making appropriate relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the\nclass as a whole;\n* * * * * *\na. Rule 23(a) Qualifications\n(1). Numerosity\nThe number of persons in the proposed class exceeds 1,220, demonstrating that as a practical matter individual\nlawsuits would be so burdensome on the parties (and the courts) that they could not be litigated otherwise.\nIndividual litigation is even less likely when one considers that the putative class members are, by definition, low-\nincome persons who could not afford to prosecute their own actions. Although the number of persons is small\nenough that they could be identified with particularity, the number still is too large to permit litigation merely by\njoining all the parties. The fluid nature of the class 00 with residents arriving and leaving 00 makes this group of\n97 97\nplaintiffs particularly suitable for class certification. Although defendants argue to the contrary, any given\nindividual easily can be identified with precision as being within or outside the class merely by looking at a list of\nresidents and a list of applicants. The definition is not too vague, but the number is too large to accommodate by\njoinder.\n(2). Commonality\nThe same single source of harm alleged by the plaintiffs is alleged to have occurred to all class members. The\nsame alleged rights, allegedly protected by and enforceable under the same laws, would apply to plaintiffs and\nproposed class members alike. The remedy would apply to all class members the same as it would apply to the\nnamed plaintiffs. Contrary to HAKC's argument, the plaintiffs and proposed class members share more than a\nfew characteristics. The few factual differences among individual persons are too insignificant, relative to what\nthe persons allegedly have in common, to defeat certification. The common questions of law and fact are\nsignificant, substantial and obvious.\n(3). Typicality\nLikewise, the named plaintiffs' grievances are typical of those of the potential class members. The deteriorating\nconditions 00 resulting from the same action (and inaction) of defendants 00 of which resident plaintiffs complain\n97 97\nare the same as the conditions allegedly causing de facto demolition that reduces the amount of housing for the\n1006 plaintiff applicant. The factual proof and legal theories to be applied by *1006 the named plaintiffs are precisely\nthe same as would be used by the potential class members. The relief which the named plaintiffs seek is\nprecisely the same which would relieve the alleged harm to the other potential class members.\nThe named plaintiffs quite clearly have a personal stake in the outcome. Their standing to sue, and to represent\nthe proposed class, is manifest. A judgment in their favor clearly would benefit the proposed class members.\n(4). Representation Adequacy\nAs discussed above, the named plaintiffs have interests which are common to those of the potential class\nmembers. The plaintiffs' pleadings and supporting documentation demonstrate that they would prosecute the\nmatter vigorously, with the assistance of qualified counsel. Defendants have raised no reason to doubt either of\nthese propositions, and the court is aware of none. There is no reason to believe the named plaintiffs and any\npotential class members would have any conflict of interest. The named plaintiffs appear ready, willing and able\nto represent the other class members fairly, adequately and vigorously.\n\nb. Rule 23(b)(2) Requirements\nUnder 23(b)(2) the proposed class first must satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a) which, as discussed above,\nhave been met in this instance. Second, the opposing party must have acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to a class, thereby making final injunctive relief and corresponding declaratory relief\nappropriate.\nAs discussed above, the actions (or inaction) attributed to the defendants are the same with regard to all plaintiffs\nand potential class members. The most appropriate remedy under the circumstances would be injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief. That is precisely what the named plaintiffs seek, which would benefit all members of the\npotential class.\nCuriously, HAKC argues that no class certification is necessary, inasmuch as any relief automatically would apply\nas a practical matter to all potential class members. This argument must fail for two reasons. First, Rule 23(b)(2)\nspecifically provides for certifying a class in instances such as this. Second, the experience in a similar case\nillustrates how invalid this argument is.\nIn Todd v. Housing Authority of Kansas City, No. 84-0852-CV-W-1 (W.D.Mo. Dec. 14, 1984), HAKC was a\ndefendant which had stipulated to maintenance of the class action by a group of persons virtually identical to\nthose which would be in the class here. Three years after a consent decree had been entered on December 14,\n1984, class members had to return to the court for enforcement and modification of the decree to assure\ncompliance. Without certification in that case, the named plaintiffs there would have had no standing, and there\nwould have been no class members to seek enforcement. In other words, the resolution would not 00 as a\n97\npractical matter 00 necessarily benefit all of the class if it had not been certified. The virtually complete identity of\n97\nparties in that case, compared to this one, is too obvious for HAKC's argument to have any credence.\n3. Conclusion\nThe requirements under Rule 23(a) clearly have been met. The appropriateness of injunctive and declaratory\nrelief, if any, demonstrates that a class should be certified under Rule 23(b)(2). The nature of the class suggests\nthat notice of certification should be a relatively simple task. The residents of Watkins Homes, obviously, are to be\nfound in a relatively small geographic area. The applicants, by definition, have their names on a waiting list which\npresumably shows how they can be located.\nA reasonable timetable for notification must be established. To promote efficiency, by reducing paperwork and\nthis court's involvement, the parties will be directed to cooperate in developing a notification procedure for\napproval by the court. The procedure would include the text of a notice, the means of distributing it, the\nmechanism for \"opting out,\" and the financing for the notice. The parties will be expected to act in good faith to\n1007 develop stipulations *1007 concerning the notice procedure to be submitted for approval.\nB. Dismissal\nThe federal defendants (\"HUD\") rely upon numerous points in support of their motion to dismiss the claims:\n1. Plaintiffs failed to state a claim under Section 18(d) of the Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 1437p)\nbecause\na. No actual demolition has occurred.\nb. Section 18(d) does not express or imply a private right of action.\nc. Any action by HUD is not subject to judicial review, because under the Administrative\nProcedures Act (5 U.S.C. § 701-706)\n\n(1). Such action, if any, was discretionary, (5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)) and\n(2). An adequate remedy is available against HAKC alone (5 U.S.C. § 704).\n2. Plaintiffs failed to state viable civil rights claims under Title VI (42 U.S.C. § 2000d) and Title VIII\n(42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a) and 3608(d)) because\na. Sovereign immunity was not waived.\nb. No prima facie violations were pleaded against HAKC, so HUD's alleged failure to enforce\nagainst HAKC has not been pleaded.\nc. Titles VI and VIII neither express nor imply a private right of action.\nd. Plaintiffs do not allege civil rights violations by HUD under\n(1). Title VI, or\n(2). Title VIII, Section 804(a), or\n(3). Title VIII, Section 808(e)(5).\n3. Plaintiffs failed to state a contract claim because\na. They are not third-party beneficiaries.\nb. They have not identified a breach of contract by HUD.\nThe arguments will be examined individually.\n1. Section 18(d) of Housing Act\na. Decision to Demolish\nHUD argues that, in the absence of an affirmative decision to cause actual demolition, no claim is stated under\nSection 18(d) of the Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 1437p). This argument misses the point of plaintiffs' complaint.\nPlaintiffs allege that a de facto demolition has occurred by defendants' inaction. This is simply an allegation that,\nby inaction, defendants have accomplished what they cannot do by action.\nRather than alleging a conscious decision to demolish actively, the complaint essentially alleges that HUD\npassively decided not to decide to maintain the housing units. Plaintiffs allege this \"non-decision\" effectively left\nthe units to deteriorate until overt demolition was the only available option. Plaintiffs should have the opportunity\nto prove that defendants accomplished, by inaction, what they were prohibited from doing actively.\nThis concept of \"demolition by neglect\" has been applied previously. In Concerned Tenants Ass'n of Father Panik\nVillage v. Pierce, 685 F.Supp. 316, 321 (D.Conn.1988), the court said:\n* * * By enacting § 1437p, Congress intended to prohibit the destruction of public housing projects\nwithout HUD approval. Because the result 00 the unapproved destruction of a housing project 00 is\n97 97\nthe same whether done by a wrecking ball and bulldozers or by neglect that renders the units\nuninhabitable, the requirements of § 1437p should apply to both actual and de facto demolitions.\nTo conclude otherwise would allow public housing agencies to evade the law by simply allowing\nhousing projects to fall into decay and disrepair.\n* * * * * *\nThe use of the words \"any action\" and \"any step\" [in 42 U.S.C. § 1437p] can only be reasonably\nconstrued to encompass conduct, including an omission or failure to act, by a public housing\n\nagency that would result in the destruction of all or part of a housing project in the sense that the\nhousing units would no longer be habitable. As reflected in the amendment [in 1987], Congress\nintended to ensure that tenants could fully enforce compliance with the physical condition\n1008 requirements of § 1437p. To limit these *1008 requirements to actual demolitions would\nundermine this intent.\nHUD distinguishes Concerned Tenants by saying it applies only to neglect by the public housing agency (in this\ncase, HAKC) rather than to neglect by HUD. However, HUD has the authority (and, plaintiff contends, the duty) to\nenforce housing regulations which would prevent such demolition by negligence. As in Concerned Tenants,\nplaintiffs have stated a claim sufficiently here to overcome a motion to dismiss.\nb. Private Right of Action\nHUD contends that no private right of action exists under Housing Act Section 18(d) (42 U.S.C. § 1437p, which\nregulates demolitions) in favor of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs respond that other courts have found implied rights of action\nto enforce a closely related subsection, 42 U.S.C. § 1437a (which regulates rent charges).\nIn Howard v. Pierce, 738 F.2d 722, 725 (6th Cir.1984), the court found that low-income tenants clearly were the\nintended beneficiaries and thus privately could enforce regulations limiting rent amounts. In Castleman v. HUD,\nNo. 83-0461-CV-W-8, 1988 WL 220583 (W.D.Mo. Sept. 8, 1988), the Honorable Joseph E. Stevens Jr. found an\nimplied right of action to enforce rights to limited rent amounts in the public housing program. In Gonzalez v. St.\nMargaret's House Hous. Dev. Fund Corp., 620 F.Supp. 806, 809 (S.D.N.Y.1985),recon'd on other grounds, 668\nF.Supp. 187 (S.D.N. Y.1987), the courts also found low-income tenants could sue to enforce rights through\nprivate litigation. Likewise, the Supreme Court has found rights enforceable (through 42 U.S.C. § 1983) against\npublic housing authorities in 42 U.S.C. § 1437a. Wright v. Roanoke Redev. & Hous. Auth., 479 U.S. 418, 107\nS.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987).\nThe section in question here, Section 1437p, is so closely related to Section 1437a that these cases could be\nconsidered dispositive. After all, if the intended primary beneficiaries 00 low-income tenants 00 can enforce\n97 97\nrestrictions on rent, they should be able to enforce restrictions on demolition. Nevertheless, in an abundance of\ncaution, the test promulgated in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 2087, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975) will be\napplied to determine whether a private right of action can be inferred from Section 1437p. The four-part Cort test\nis: (1) Does the statute create a federal right in favor of plaintiff? (2) Does the legislative intent, explicitly or\nimplicitly, create a private remedy or deny one? (3) Is it consistent with the purpose of the statute to imply such a\nremedy for plaintiff? (4) Is the cause of action one relegated to the sovereign states, such that inferring a right of\naction based solely on federal law would be inappropriate?\nFirst, as noted in Concerned Tenants, supra, 685 F.Supp. at 320, the creation of a right is clear. The court in that\ncase discussed Edwards v. District of Columbia, 821 F.2d 651 (D.C.Cir.1987), where Section 1437p was found\nnot to have created an enforceable right that might be violated by a de facto demolition. The Congress promptly\namended Section 1437p, and the court in Concerned Tenants quoted H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 426, 100th Cong., 1st\nSess. (1987), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1987 pp. 3317, 3458:\n* * * This provision is intended to correct an erroneous interpretation of the existing statute by the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Edwards v. District of Columbia and shall be\nfully enforceable by tenants of and applicants for the housing that is threatened.\nSecond, the Congressional disagreement with the Edwards court, and the reference to enforceability, manifest\nintent to create a private right of action. Third, the purpose of the statute obviously is to benefit low-income\ntenants, so permitting a private right to enforce is consistent with the purpose of the statute. See Wright v.\nRoanoke Redev. & Housing Auth., supra, 479 U.S. at 430, 107 S.Ct. at 773; See also, Cannon v. University of\nChicago, 441 U.S. 677, 703, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1961, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Finally, the entire scheme of the\nHousing Act, including promulgation, enforcement and funding, is and has been a matter for the federal\n1009 government. It is *1009 not traditionally a matter for state governments, so inferring a federal cause of action\nwould not be inappropriate.\n\nCourts have found a private right of action under Section 1437a, and the court in Concerned Tenants, supra,\nfound an implied right of action under Section 1437p. Independently, this court also finds a private right of action\nunder Section 1437p by applying the Cort test. Plaintiffs' complaint withstands the motion to dismiss on this point.\nc. Judicial Review Despite the APA\n(1). Discretionary Act 00 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)\n97\nHUD relies upon Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) in contending that the\nAdministrative Procedures Act, under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), presumes immunity from judicial review of a decision \nnot to enforce regulations. Plaintiffs respond that, under Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, 108 S.Ct. 1372, 99\nL.Ed.2d 618 (1988), there is a strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action.\nA comparison of the related case law reveals that these two cases are not necessarily in conflict. Rather, as\nnoted by plaintiffs and in the Chaney case itself, the presumed immunity is a narrow exception to the overall\npresumption favoring judicial enforcement. See, Heckler v. Chaney, supra, 470 U.S. at 826, 830, and 838, 105\nS.Ct. at 1652, 1655, and 1659; Dunlop v. Bachowski, 421 U.S. 560, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975); \nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). Indeed, the APA\nitself provides, in part, \"[a] person ... adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action ... is entitled to judicial\nreview thereof.\"\nChaney is a peculiar case wherein the federal Food and Drug Administration was challenged by Oklahoma and\nTexas death-row inmates. They argued that the drug used for lethal injections had not been approved by the FDA\nas \"safe and effective\" for human executions. The court would not permit judicial review of FDA's refusal to\nenforce drug laws, analogizing FDA's position to the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity. Chaney, supra, 470 U.S.\nat 827 and 834, 105 S.Ct. at 1653 and 1657. The court reiterated, in its closing paragraph, that the exemption\nfrom judicial review is a narrow one which is used only where Congress intended an agency action to exempt\nfrom such review. Chaney, supra, 470 U.S. at 838, 105 S.Ct. at 1659.\nAs noted above, a private right of action clearly was intended by the Congress. Such a right, by definition, is a\nright to obtain judicial review. Contrary to HUD's position, this matter is not within the narrow exemption from\njudicial review. Rather, it is within the general rule that agency action should be subject to judicial review. The\nsame finding was made by Judge Stevens in Castleman v. HUD, No. 83-0461-CV-W-8 (W.D.Mo. Sept. 8, 1988)\nin regard to the closely related subsection, 42 U.S.C. § 1437a.\n(2). Remedy Against HAKC 00 5 U.S.C. § 704\n97\nHUD argues that an adequate remedy is available in an action against HAKC alone so, under 5 U.S.C. § 704,\nreview of HUD's actions is barred. Plaintiffs respond that any remedy fashioned against HAKC alone would be\nineffective without a judgment against HUD. The court agrees.\nThe pervasive regulation, the frequent and close oversight, and the funding provided by HUD to HAKC illustrates\nthat HAKC could not correct alleged problems to any significant degree without HUD cooperation, supervision,\napproval and funding. A remedy directed only at HAKC could be nearly worthless in these circumstances. Any\nmeaningful remedy could be achieved only with HUD's involvement, so Section 704 does not preclude judicial\nreview here.\n2. Civil Rights Claims\n\na. Sovereign Immunity\nHUD argues that sovereign immunity bars the claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §\n2000d) and Title VIII of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a) and 3608(d)). However, HUD also\n1010 acknowledges in its *1010 motion and reply to plaintiffs' response that the civil rights claims could be brought\nunder 5 U.S.C. § 702, which provides, in pertinent part:\n* * * An action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating\na claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official\ncapacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein denied on the\nground that it is against the United States.... * * *\nHUD's acknowledgement is consistent with several cases. See Young v. Pierce, 628 F.Supp. 1037, 1058\n(E.D.Tex.1985),vacated on other grounds,822 F.2d 1368 (5th Cir. 1987); Larson v. Domestic and Foreign\nCommerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 690-691, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 1461-1462, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949); See also, Dugan v.\nRank, 372 U.S. 609, 621-622, 83 S.Ct. 999, 1006-1007, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963); Gautreaux v. Romney, 448 F.2d\n731, 735 (7th Cir.1971); United States v. Yonkers Board of Ed., 594 F.Supp. 466, 469 (S.D.N.Y.1984).\nPlaintiffs oppose the motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds. However, they ask in the alternative for\nleave to amend their complaint to insert the reference to Section 702 so they can maintain their civil rights claims.\nRule 15, Fed.R. Civ.P., provides that leave to amend will be granted freely when justice requires. The intent of the\ncomplaint is obvious, so the amendment would be almost a formality. Nevertheless, plaintiffs' basis for bringing\ncivil rights claims against a federal agency should be established explicitly in their complaint. Accordingly, leave\nwill be granted to amend the complaint.\nb. Prima Facie Case Against HAKC\nHUD contends that plaintiffs failed to allege a prima facie case of civil rights violations by HAKC and, therefore,\nHUD cannot be held liable for any such violations. Plaintiffs respond that they have shown discriminatory effects\nand, thus, have alleged a prima facie case under each of Title VIII of the Federal Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604)\nand Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000d).\n(1). Title VIII Claim\nHUD contends that its liability under Title VIII would be due to its failure to enforce regulations against HAKC\nwhen it was violating Title VIII. That liability would presuppose that HAKC was violating Title VIII, but no such\nviolation has been alleged by plaintiffs, HUD argues.\nPlaintiffs respond that 99% of the residents at Watkins Homes are members of a racial minority, and most of the\nhomeless or inadequately housed persons are minority members. They further respond that the alleged de facto\ndemolition effectively reduces the quality and number of housing units for disproportionately more minority\npersons than non-minority persons.\nThe case law supports plaintiffs' position. The prima facie Title VIII claim was discussed in the relatively recent\ncase of Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 934 (2nd Cir.),aff'd488 U.S. 15, 109\nS.Ct. 276, 102 L.Ed.2d 180reh. denied,488 U.S. 1023, 109 S.Ct. 824, 102 L.Ed.2d 813 (1988). In that case, the\ncourt compared the Title VIII standard to the standard for Title VII (employment discrimination) and relied in part\non two cases from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court said:\nThe prima facie standard for Title VIII disparate impact cases involving public defendants is a\nquestion of first impression in this circuit. In Boyd v. Lefrak Org., 509 F.2d 1110 (2d Cir.),rehearing\ndenied,517 F.2d 918 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,423 U.S. 896, 96 S.Ct. 197, 46 L.Ed.2d 129 (1975), a\ndivided panel, considering a Title VIII case against a private defendant, doubted the relevance of\n\nthe methodology used in Title VII litigation. 509 F.2d at 1114. Since then, however, we have\npointedly accepted the relevance of Title VII cases to Title VIII cases. See United States v. Starrett\nCity Assoc., 840 F.2d 1096, 1101 (2d Cir. 1988); Robinson [v. 12 Lofts Realty, Inc.], 610 F.2d\n[1032] at 1036-37 [(2nd Cir.1979)]. Thus, even if the views expressed in Lefrak still apply in a Title\n1011 VIII case against a private defendant, a matter of considerable uncertainty, the *1011 disparate\nimpact approach of Title VII cases is fully applicable to this Title VIII case brought against a public\ndefendant.\nUnder disparate impact analysis, as other circuits have recognized, a prima facie case is\nestablished by showing that the challenged practice of the defendant \"actually or predictably\nresults in racial discrimination; in other words that it has a discriminatory effect.\" United States v.\nCity of Black Jack, 508 F.2d 1179, 1184-85 (8th Cir.1974),cert. denied,422 U.S. 1042, 95 S.Ct.\n2656, 45 L.Ed.2d 694 (1975). The plaintiff need not show that the decision complained of was\nmade with discriminatory intent. United States v. Yonkers Board of Education, [supra], 837 F.2d\n1181, 1217 (2d Cir. 1987); Robinson, 610 F.2d at 1036-38; Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, 564\nF.2d 126, 146-48 (3d Cir.1977),cert. denied,435 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 1457, 55 L.Ed.2d 499 (1978);\nSmith v. Anchor Bldg. Corp, 536 F.2d 231, 233 (8th Cir. 1976); Black Jack, [supra], 508 F.2d at\n1184-85. Refusal to require intent in disparate impact cases is entirely consistent with our prior\ndecisions. See Starrett City, [supra], 840 F.2d 1100; Yonkers, 837 F.2d at 1217; Robinson, 610\nF.2d at 1036-38. In determining whether discriminatory effect is sufficient, we look to\ncongressional purpose, as gleaned from the legislative history of Title VIII, related Title VII\njurisprudence, and practical concerns. Although none of these considerations is alone\ndeterminative, taken together they strongly suggest that discriminatory impact alone violates Title\nVIII.\nHUD incorrectly would limit the field for testing alleged discrimination to only those persons who reside at Watkins\nHomes. HUD relies upon Betsey v. Turtle Creek Associates, 736 F.2d 983 (4th Cir.1984). That case concerned\ndisparate treatment of minority tenants as compared to non-minority tenants within a particular building of an\napartment complex. The court, at 987, looked to whether there was a disproportionate impact on minority\nmembers (as compared to non-minority members) within the limited group to which the defendant's policy\napplied.\nIn the present case, the allegation of discrimination is broader, and should be applied to a broader range of\npersons. The allegation is that, among low-income persons who have or seek subsidized housing, the alleged de\nfacto demolition at Watkins Homes has a disproportionate and discriminatory impact upon persons who belong to\nminorities than upon non-minority persons. The comparison concerns all low-income persons who have or seek\nsubsidized housing operated and administered by HUD. Such low-income persons are not all members of\nminorities, although nearly all (99%) persons living at Watkins Homes are members of minorities. Therefore,\nactions affecting residents or applicants at Watkins Homes are more likely to affect members of minorities than\nwould actions affecting all low-income persons. The allegation of disparate impact is sufficient to withstand a\nmotion to dismiss.\n(2). Title VI Claim\nIn the Eighth Circuit, the disparate-impact analysis does not apply to claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964. Intent to discriminate is required under Title VI, rather than mere proof of disparate impact or effects. In \nWilliams v. City of Sioux Falls, 846 F.2d 509, 511 (8th Cir.1988), the court said:\nThe district court correctly recognized that under plaintiff's individual claim, each theory of\nrecovery is viable only if the City intentionally treated the plaintiff less favorably because of his\nrace. See Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 463 U.S. 582, 103 S.Ct. 3221, 77 L.Ed.2d 866\n(1983); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). The court\nemployed the traditional analysis utilized to decide questions of intentional discrimination, asking\nfirst whether the plaintiff had established a prima facie case.\n\n* * * * * *\nAbsent an allegation of intentional discrimination, the claim under Title VI must be dismissed.\n1012  c. Private Actions Under Titles VI and VIII\n*1012\nInasmuch as no viable Title VI claim has been alleged by plaintiffs, there is no need to reach the issue of whether\na private action may be brought against HUD under Title VI. The claim under Title VIII is another matter, however.\nImmediately after a lengthy discussion of a private right of action under Title VI, the court in Clients' Council v.\nPierce, 711 F.2d 1406, 1424-1425 (8th Cir.1983), examined the Title VIII claim. The court found that HUD \"failed\nto carry out its affirmative duty to `institute action the direct result of which was to be the implementation of the\ndual and mutual goals for fair housing and the elimination of discrimination in that housing.'\" 711 F.2d at 1425,\nquoting in part Banks v. Perk, 341 F.Supp. 1175, 1182 (N.D.Ohio 1972),aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other\ngrounds,473 F.2d 910 (6th Cir.1973). The only fair reading of the discussion is that a private right of action\nagainst HUD is implied in Title VIII.\nd. Civil Rights Violations by HUD\nHUD contends that plaintiffs have failed to allege civil rights violations by HUD under Title VI; Title VIII, Section\n804(a); or Title VIII, Section 808(e)(5). As stated above, plaintiffs have failed to alleged the intentional\ndiscrimination necessary for a Title VI violation. HUD's position regarding Sections 804(a) and 808(e)(5) of Title\nVIII (42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a) and 3608(d)) relies upon its characterization of plaintiffs' claims as \"nonenforcement\"\nclaims. The complaint reveals, however, that the claims are allegations of actual overt and direct involvement by\nHUD in the passive decision-making process to permit alleged de facto demolition to occur. The allegations of\ndiscriminatory activity by HUD bring the claims within the requirements of the cases cited by HUD. Therefore, the\nclaims against HUD under Title VIII, Section 804(a); or Title VIII, Section 808(e)(5) (42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a) and\n3608(d)) need not be dismissed for failure to allege discriminatory activity by HUD.\n3. Contract Claim\na. Third-Party Beneficiary\nHUD argues that the plaintiffs were not the intended beneficiaries of the annual contributions contract (\"ACC\")\nbetween HUD and HAKC. Therefore, HUD contends, plaintiffs cannot bring claims under the ACC as third-party\nbeneficiaries. The case law is contrary.\nIn Ashton v. Pierce, 716 F.2d 56,modified,723 F.2d 70 (D.C.Cir.1983), public housing tenants were found to be\nthird-party beneficiaries of the ACC and had the right to enforce the duties arising under it. Likewise, third-party\nenforcement rights were found under the ACC in Concerned Tenants of Father Panik Village v. Pierce, supra, 685\nF.Supp. at 324.\nIn Holbrook v. Pitt, 643 F.2d 1261, 1270 (7th Cir.1981), public housing tenants were found to be third-party\nbeneficiaries to a \"HAP\" contract. A \"HAP\" contract provides for housing assistance payments by HUD to\nlandlords to maintain low rent levels pursuant to Section 8 of the Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 1437f). See also, Knox\nHill Tenant Council v. Washington, 448 F.2d 1045 (D.C.Cir.1971); Free v. Landrieu, 666 F.2d 698, 700, 702 (1st\nCir.1981).\nb. Breach of Contract\nHUD asserts that plaintiffs have failed to allege a breach of contract to support their claim. The purpose of the\nACC is to provide safe, decent, sanitary and affordable housing for eligible low-income people. See Concerned\n\nTenants of Father Panik Village v. Pierce, supra, 685 F.Supp. at 323; Ashton v. Pierce, supra, 716 F.2d at 66; \nHolbrook v. Pitt, 643 F.2d at 1271-1272. The agreement authorizes payment of funds to a housing authority on\nthe condition that it complies with federal housing laws. See, 42 U.S.C. § 1437c, 42 U.S.C. § 1437g, and 24\nC.F.R. § 941.103. In this instance, plaintiffs clearly have alleged failure to comply with the contract requirements.\nA breach has been sufficiently alleged to evade dismissal.\n1013 C. Strike Supplemental Suggestions\n*1013\nIn the motion filed October 30, 1989, HUD objects to plaintiffs' supplementary suggestions, which were filed on\nOctober 19, 1989. The supplementary suggestions called to the court's attention a recent decision from a district\ncourt in Ohio on a related matter. HUD's argument was that plaintiffs had no permission to file the additional\npleading, and so it should not be considered. Alternatively, HUD requested that its response to the supplementary\nsuggestions be considered. For the sake of clarity in the record, plaintiffs will be granted leave nunc pro tunc to\nfile supplementary suggestions. Further, HUD's motion to strike the suggestions will be denied, but the alternative\nrequest for consideration of the response to the supplementation will be granted.\nD. Stay Discovery\nHUD filed a motion to stay discovery pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss. The motion would appear to be\nmoot, if based entirely upon the need to await a ruling on the motion. Of course, the pendency of a dispositive\nmotion is not, by itself, sufficient to stay discovery. See Local Rule 15 D.\nE. Compel Production\nPlaintiffs filed a motion on December 6, 1989, to compel production of documents. HUD filed opposing\nsuggestions, relying upon the fact that a motion to dismiss and a motion to stay discovery were pending.\nAttached to the motion is a document which is purported to be a letter dated November 6, 1989, from counsel for\nHUD. The text of the purported letter:\nPerhaps I am obtuse, but I do not believe that Local Rule 15D applies to require completion of\ndiscovery pending a motion to stay that same discovery. Otherwise, the one would moot one's\nown motion, don't you think? We will await ruling on our motion or on any motion to compel you\nfind it necessary to file.\nThe purported letter's observation suggests two interesting concepts. First, it implies that a motion to stay\n[2]\ndiscovery is not a motion within the meaning of Local Rule 15 D.  The rule does not exempt particular types of\nmotions. Second, the author is apparently so concerned about making the motion moot, that the inescapable\nconsequence is overlooked. That is, by refusing to comply with discovery merely because a motion to stay is\npending, a party effectively is granting its own motion to stay 00 even before the court has ruled. Such a\n97\nphenomenon would reduce a court's orders to useless and senseless formalities. The parties may be assured\nthat this court's orders are not intended to be viewed or received so cavalierly.\nThe attitude conveyed in the letter also appeared in the opposition to the motion, although HUD did concede that\na dispositive motion does not automatically stay discovery under Local Rule 15. HUD's sole (albeit misguided)\nreason for refusing production is the pendency of a motion to stay discovery. Therefore, HUD should be free to\nproduce the discoverable materials, now that the motion to stay has been denied. Denial of the motion to stay\nordinarily would have permitted summary disposition of the motion to compel, but the circumstances suggested\nthat some guidance on the local rules, especially concerning discovery, would be helpful to the parties.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\nAs discussed above, plaintiffs will be permitted to represent a certified class. The parties will develop a proposed\nplan for managing the class action, including the notification mechanism, to be submitted for court approval.\nThe motion to dismiss will be denied, with two exceptions. First, a ruling on dismissal on the basis of sovereign\nimmunity will be deferred, pending a motion by plaintiffs to file an amended complaint which would invoke\n1014 jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. § 702. Second, the claims against *1014 HAKC and HUD pursuant to Title VI of the\n[3]\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d) will be dismissed for failure to allege intentional discrimination.\nHUD's motion to strike plaintiffs' supplemental suggestions will be denied in that the suggestions will not be\nstricken, but granted in that HUD's response will be considered. Plaintiffs' supplemental suggestions will be\nconsidered upon leave granted nunc pro tunc to file them. The motion to stay discovery will be denied. The\nmotion to compel production will be granted. If the parties believe revision of the discovery schedule would be\nhelpful, they may choose to submit jointly a proposed amended scheduling order.\nIt is\nORDERED that plaintiffs' motion, filed January 31, 1989, seeking an order determining that this matter should be\nmaintained as a class action is granted. It is further\nORDERED that the proposed class is certified, pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), Fed.R. Civ.P., such that the named\nplaintiffs may proceed on behalf of the class to seek injunctive and declaratory relief, and costs (but not monetary\ndamages). It is further\nORDERED that the parties shall, within 30 days, jointly submit a proposed plan for notification of class members\nand for management of this class action, including any stipulations which would promote efficient management,\nfor court approval. It is further\nORDERED that defendants' motion, filed May 23, 1989, to dismiss the complaint is granted in part and is denied\nin part. It is further\nORDERED that Count VII (i.e., plaintiffs' claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d)\nis dismissed as to all defendants. It is further\nORDERED that defendants' motion, filed October 30, 1989, to strike plaintiffs' supplemental suggestions is\ndenied in part and granted in part. It is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs are granted leave, nunc pro tunc, to file their supplemental suggestions, and the record\nshall continue to show it was filed October 19, 1989. It is further\nORDERED that defendants' motion, filed August 8, 1989, to stay discovery, is denied as moot. It is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs' motion, filed December 6, 1989, to compel production of documents requested in\nplaintiffs' first request for production of documents, is granted. It is further\nORDERED that the federal defendants shall respond within 30 days of the date of this order to the plaintiffs' first\nrequest, which was served on defendants on July 6, 1989, for production of documents. It is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs submit within 30 days a bill of reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred\nby plaintiffs in filing their motion to compel, which plaintiffs would hope to recover from defendants.\n[1] For purposes of ruling these four motions, the facts set forth by plaintiffs will be accepted as accurate 00 just as\n97\nHUD accepted plaintiffs' facts in its May 23, 1989, motion to dismiss at page 8.\n\n[2] Local Rule 15 D: D. Filing of Motions Does Not Automatically Stay Discovery. Absent an order of the Court to\nthe contrary, the filing of a motion, including a discovery motion, a motion for summary judgment, or a motion to\ndismiss, does not excuse counsel from complying with this rule and any scheduling order entered in the case.\n(emphasis added)\n[3] Plaintiffs are requested to acknowledge the dismissal of Title VI claims when plaintiffs file their motion to\namend their complaint, and in any proposed order they submit. Such acknowledgement in the motion and order\nwould avoid additional motion practice on that point, while preserving the issue for appeal.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
