HAKC agrees to perform comprehensive modernization\nand rehabilitation of Riverview to transform the development\n<  .  . -  c  -  .\ninto safe, decent and sanitary condition without loss of any\nunits through the following course of action:\nA.  HAKC will contract for an independent architect to\nprepare plans and specifications based on the needs\nassessment to rehabilitate the Riverview development\nidentified in the Major Reconstruction of Obsolete\nProperty grant application approved by HUD on September\n30, 1992  (MROP).

HAKC agrees to make each of the 232 units of\nRiverview, all the common areas and grounds safe,\ndecent, sanitary and viable for the next 20 years\nwithout any demolition, conversion or disposition.  As\npart of the rehabilitation, all services on site at\nRiverview controlled by HAKC shall be improved, in-\ncluding but not limited to the playground, park areas,\nlandscaping, outside lighting and security.  Security\nguards will be provided to the extent funds are avail-\nable for their employment.\nC.  HUD will provide $10,536,900 of the MROP grant for\nHAKC to complete the modernization and rehabilitation\nof Riverview.  Such funds will be provided for moderni-\nzation and rehabilitation upon HAKC's submission and\nHUD's approval of the architectural plans and speci-\nfications and HAKC's development plan for Riverview.\nIf HUD determines that HAKC is deficient in its\nmodernization of Riverview, it will provide HAKC with\nnotice and a reasonable opportunity to correct the\ndeficiencies, prior to withholding any funds.  HUD will\nsimultaneously provide a copy of such notice to plain-\ntiffs' counsel.  If HUD subsequently determines to\nwithhold funds from HAKC because HAKC did not take the\nnecessary corrective action, plaintiffs reserve the\nright to challenge in this or any other court any such\ndecision.\n- 3 -\n\nHAKC will provide plaintiffs' counsel with a copy\nof the quarterly report that it submits to HUD pursuant\nto paragraph 10 of this Consent Decree which details\nHAKC·s progress in completing the modernization of\nRiverview.\nD.  Until the completion of the modernization of\nRiverview, HAKC agrees to meet with the Riverview\nResident Management Corporation (RMC) and plaintiffs'\ncounsel on at least a quarterly basis to discuss plans\nfor the modernization of Riverview and the progress of\nsaid modernization.\nE.  HUD and HAKC agree to allow the RMC to be an\nactive participant in the selection of the independent\narchitect.  This purpose shall be accomplished by the\nappointment by the RMC of two individuals to serve as\nmembers of the Riverview Task Force.  Notice to these\nindividuals will be made by giving notice to plain-\ntiffs' counsel of all task force meetings.\nHAKC agrees to consult with the RMC with respect\nto the modernization which includes the selection of\nthe architect for the preparation of the plans and\nspecifications, selection of the contractor to perform\nthe actual rehabilitation work at Riverview, and tenant\ndisplacement and relocation plans and proceedures.\nF.

Upon written request, HUD will provide to\nplaintiffs any copy of HUD's response to such applica-\ntion and, in the event HUD approves the application,\nHUD will provide plaintiffs with a copy of said ap-\nproval.

HAKC will offer tours to any applicant who has\nbeen offered a unit at Riverview.  HAKC can delegate\nthis responsibility to the RMC, if the RMC agrees.
