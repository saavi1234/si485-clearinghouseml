The case was tried  in January, 1978,\nand  District  Judge  Don  J.  Young  issued  an Opinion  in May,\n1983.  Judge Young  found that both LMHA and HUD were liable\nfor  intentional  discrimination  and  segregation  in  LMHA's\npublic  housing  programs.  Judge  Young  awarded  monetary\ndamages and equitable relief, and ordered the preparation of\nan affirmative action Plan to correct past segregation.\nThe  Sixth  Circuit  affirmed  the  district  court's\nfinding  that  there  had  been  impermissible  internal\nsegregation within LMHA's housing projects.

The court  affirmed  in part and\nreversed in part, and ordered the defendants to comply with\nthe provisions of the affirmative action  that were upheld.\nThe  Sixth  Circuit  also  directed  that  the district  court\ndecide the issue of whether HUD should be held liable.\nThis  court  issued  an  Opinion  and Order  dated\nJune  6,  1989, finding  that  HUD was  liable  for the\ndiscrimination  in  public  housing  in  Lucas  County, and\nordered  HUD to comply  with  the terms  of the affirmative\naction .\nAn  award of attorneys'  fees is authorized by the\nCivil  Rights  Attorney's  Fees  Award  Act,  42 U.S.C. §  1988:\ns\n\"In any action or proceeding  to enforce a provision of §§\n1981, 1982, 1983, . .. of this Title, . . . , or title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court, in its discretion,\nmay allow the prevailing party, other than the United States,\na reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\"\nThe  court  must  first  determine  whether  the\nplaintiffs  are entitled  to an award  of attorneys'  fees.\nAlthough an award of fees  under § 1988 is a matter of the\ncourt's  discretion, see 42 U.S.C.  § 1988, a court  should\nordinarily  award  fees  under  the statute  to a  prevailing\nplaintiff  \"'\"unless  special  circumstances  would  render  such\nan award unjust.\"'\"  Hensley v.

A  plaintiff\nwho  succeeds  on  only  some  claims  for  relief  may  still  be\nentitled  to attorneys' fees.  Id. at 434.  The Supreme Court\ndeclined  to  articulate  a  precise  method  for  calculating  a\nreasonable  fee  when  a  plaintiff  achieves  partial  success.\nSee id. at 435-37.  Instead, the Court left such calculations\nto the  discretion  of  the district  court, counseling  that a\nparty  who  obtains  excellent  results  should  not  receive  a\nreduced  fee  simply  because  he  failed  to  prevail  on  every\nissue, and a party who achieves limited success should not be\nawarded fees for every hour expended on the case.  Id.  \"The\nresult is what matters.\"  Id. at 435  (footnote omitted).  In\naffirming the Hensley standard, the Court recently stated:\nThe  touchstone  of  the  prevailing  party\ninquiry must be the material  alteration\nof the legal relationship of the parties\nin  a  manner  which  Congress  sought  to\npromote in the fee statute.  Where such\nchange  has  occurred,  the  degree  of\nAO72A  ®\n(Rtv. 8/82)\ni^fe^\n\nthe plaintiff's overall success goes to\nthe  reasonableness  of  the  award  under\nHensley,  not  to  the  availability  of  a\nfee award vel non.\nTexas  State  Teachers  Ass'n  v.

The  plaintiffs'  suit  has\nvindicated  their  rights  to  fair  housing  opportunities  by\nenjoining  LMHA  and  HUD  from  engaging  in  discriminatory\npractices  that  perpetuate  segregation  in public  housing  in\nLucas  County.

The  plaintiffs  are  thus\n\"prevailing  parties\" within  the meaning  of § 1988, Hensley,\nand Texas State Teachers Association.\nThe  next  inquiry  is  to  determine  what  is  a\n\"reasonable\"  fee.

Hens ley,  461 U.S. at 434  (quoting  S. Rep. No.\n1011,  94th  Cong.  2d  Sess.  6,  reprinted  in  1976  U.S.  Code\nCong. & Admin. News 5908, 5913).  This court has reviewed the\nattorneys'  affidavits and  finds the number  of hours claimed\nby  each  attorney  to  be  reasonable.  The  attorneys  are\nexpected  to  exercise  \"billing  judgment,\"  id.  at  437,  and\nthese affidavits, in general,  reflect  sound  legal  judgment\nas  to  the  number  of  hours  required  for  particular  tasks.\nThis  is not to say, however, that the court will compensate\nthe  attorneys  for  every  hour  listed  in  their  affidavits.\nAO72A  ®\n(Rtw.8/82) ';<V-,V-\n\nThere are two factors  that may warrant a reduction of the\nnumber of hours.  First,  should  the number of hours be\nreduced to account for the fact that the plaintiffs did not\nprevail on all their  claims?  See Texas  State  Teachers\nAss'n, 109 S. Ct. at 1492; Hensley, 461 U.S at 437.\nPlaintiffs' claims in this case may be divided into\ntwo  broad  categories:  (1) claims  related  to discrimination\nand  segregation  within  the LMHA  housing  projects; and (2)\nclaims related to the failure of LMHA and HUD to enter  into\ncooperation agreements with suburban communities to construct\naffordable housing outside the city of Toledo.  On the first\nclaim,  the plaintiffs  were  successful  before  the district\ncourt and were affirmed on appeal.  As to the second  claim,\nhowever, the Sixth  Circuit  held  that the plaintiffs  lacked\nstanding, and therefore, dismissed those claims.\n^  If this  were a case  where the plaintiffs  pressed\ntwo  unrelated  claims  and prevailed  as to one but not the\nother, it would be logical for the court to reduce the number\nof  hours by fifty  percent  (50%).  Several  factors  convince\nthe court, however, that this is not such a case.\nThe  Ninth  Circuit  has  articulated  a two-part\nanalysis to determine whether the number of hours should be\nreduced where a plaintiff's success is not total.\nFirst, the court asks whether the claims\nupon  which  the  plaintiff  failed to\nprevail  were  related  to the plaintiff's\nsuccessful  claims.  If unrelated,  the\nfinal  fee award  may not include  time\nexpended on the unsuccessful claims. If\nthe unsuccessful claims are related, then\nthe court must  apply the second  part of\n>•*••>.*•?>\nAO72A ©\n(Rtv. 8/82)\n•^^i'i^S^^^^i^^^^^iMfP^-i.^\n\nthe  analysis,  in  which  the  court\nevaluates  the  \"significance  of  the\noverall relief obtained  by the plaintiff\nin  relation  to  the  hours  reasonably\nexpended.\"  If  the  plaintiff  obtained\n\"excellent  results,\"  full  compensation\nmay be appropriate, but if only  \"partial\nor  limited  success\"  was  obtained,  full\ncompensation may be excessive.\nThorne v. City  of El Sequndo, 802 F.2d  1131, 1141  (9th Cir.\n1986) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435).  See also Fite v.\nFirst  Tennessee  Prod.  Credit  Ass'n,  861 F.2d  884, 894  (6th\nCir.  1988)(applying substantially similar analysis).\nThe plaintiffs1 unsuccessful suburban housing claim\nis  related  to  their  successful  internal  segregation  claim:\nthe unsuccessful claim is based on the same legal theory and\narises under the same statutory and constitutional provisions\nas  the . internal  segregation  claim,  but  involves  different\nfacts and remedies.  This is not a case where the two claims\nare virtually  identical  (e.g., a case raising Title VII and\n42 U.S.C. § 1981 claims), nor  is it a case where the claims\nare so unrelated that they should be treated as if raised in\ndifferent lawsuits.\nThe court also finds that  the results obtained  by\nthe plaintiffs  are substantial.  An affirmative  action plan\nis now  in effect  which  will  attempt  to undo  decades  of d_e\njure  and  de_ facto  segregation  in  public  housing  in  Lucas\nCounty.\nThe  court  concludes  that  some  reduction  of  the\naward  is  appropriate,  but  that  a  fifty  percent  (50%)\nreduction would be excessive.  The Supreme Court stated that\n8\nAO72A  ©\n(R«v.8/82)\n^i > ,*. t**^-  N**--1 a*--\n\nthe court may either identify and eliminate specific hours or\nsimply  reduce the award  to account for  the partial success.\nTexas  State  Teachers  Ass'n,  109  S.  Ct.  at  1492  (citing\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 437).  The affidavits of the plaintiffs1\nattorneys  do  not  reflect  which  hours  were  spent  on  which\nclaims, so the court cannot  identify  and eliminate  specific\nhours  expended  on  the  suburban  housing  claim.  Considering\nthat  the  two claims  are  related  but  involve  distinct  facts\nand remedies, and that the success achieved by the plaintiff\nis substantial but not complete, the court concludes that is\nis  therefore  appropriate  to  reduce  the  number  of  hours  by\ntwenty-five percent  (25%) to reflect the plaintiffs' failure\non  the suburban  housing  claim.  Compare  Zook  v.  Brown,  865\nF.2d  887, 895-96  (7th Cir. 1989) (affirming  reduction of fee\n•Jj\naward  by 75% where plaintiff prevailed  only as to a portion\nof one out of three claims) with Gilmere v. City of Atlanta,\n864 F.2d  734, 741-42  (11th Cir. 1988)(affirming  reduction of\nfee award by 25% where plaintiff prevailed as to § 1983 claim\nagainst  individual  police  officers  but  not  against\nmunicipality) and Cabrales v. County of Los Angeles, 864 F.2d\n1454,  1464-66  (9th  Cir.  1988)(affirming  reduction  of  fee\naward  by  25% where  plaintiff  prevailed  as  to  Monell  claim\nagainst  county  but  not  as  to  claims  against  individual\ndefendants).\nThe  second  factor  is whether  the  number  of  hours\nshould  be reduced  to eliminate duplication  of services.  In\nNorthcross,  the  court  held  that  in  complicated  cases\nAO72A  ®\n<Rtv. 8/82)\n\ninvolving many lawyers, the court may deduct a percentage of\nthe  total  hours  to eliminate  duplication  of  services.  611\nF.2d  at  637  (citing  Oliver  v.  Kalamazoo  Bd.  of  Educ. , 576\nF.2d  714  (6th Cir.  1978)).  The  court  finds  that, for  the\nmost  part,  the  attorneys'  affidavits  do  not  indicate\nduplication of services.  On the contrary, this case seems to\nhave been leanly staffed for the most part.  In preparing for\ntrial, two attorneys logged time on this case, but given the\ncomplexity and magnitude of the case, the court does not find\ntwo lawyers  to be excessive.  The fact that several  lawyers\nhandled  this  case  does  not  justify  a  reduction  for\nduplication  of  services.  In  a  case  that  spans  fourteen\nyears,  it  is  reasonable  that  individual  attorneys  may  come\nand  go.  The  amount  of  time  a  new  attorney  spent  in\nacquainting  herself  with  the  case  is  de  minimis;  even  an\nattorney  on  the  case  from  the  start  would  have  to  review\nrecords  and  refamiliarize  himself  after  a period  of years.\nThe  one  instance  of  duplicative  services  causing  excessive\nhours was the preparation of post trial briefs.  Kathleen A.\nGmeiner's  affidavit  states  that  she  spent  approximately\n100.75  hours  preparing  the  plaintiffs'  post  trial  brief.\nGlenn  G.  Galbreath  claims  to  have  spent  approximately  167\nhours on the same task.  For drafting  reply briefs, Gmeiner\nclaims  29 hours  and  Galbreath  claims  100 hours.  The  court\nfinds 267.75 hours for a post trial brief and 129 hours for a\nreply  brief  to  be  \"excessive,  redundant,  or  otherwise\nunnecessary.\"  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434.  Those hours should,\n1 0\nAO72A  ©\n&m W^^&i^&^^&^SS^  r^KfeKi&fc.v.^\n^\n\ntherefore, be  reduced  by  50%, or  198 hours, rounded  to  the\nnearest hour.\nThe  court,  therefore,  determines  that  the\nreasonable  number  of  hours  in  this  case  is  the  number  of\nhours  stated  in  the  attorneys'  affidavits  (2589.45  hours),\nfirst  reduced  by  198  hours  to  account  for  duplicative\nservices  and  then  reduced  by  twenty-five  percent  (25%)  to\naccount  for  partial  success,  for  a  total  of  1793  hours\n(rounded to the nearest hour).\n—-  The  next  question  is  what  hourly  rate  should  be\napplied  to  the  reasonable  number  of  hours.  In Northcross,\nthe  court  held  that  an  award  of  attorneys'  fees  should\nreflect the fair market value of the services provided.  611\nF.2d  at 638.  The fair market value is generally  calculated\nas  the  hourly  rate  charged  customarily  by  attorneys  in the\ncommunity.  Id.  Some courts have concluded  that the hourly\nrate charged  at the time the award  is made, rather  than the\nrate  charged  when  the  services  were  rendered,  is  more\nappropriate  in  order  to  compensate  for  inflation,  foregone\ninterest and delay in payment.  Daly v. Hill, 790 F.2d 1071,\n1081  (4th Cir. 1986); Ramos v. Lamm, 713 F.2d  546, 555  (10th\nCir.  1983):  Arthur  S.  Lanqenderfer,  Inc. v.  S.E.  Johnson,\nCo. , No. 76-425, slip op. at 5-6  (N.D. Ohio Jan. 11, 1988).\n| The  Sixth  Circuit  has  cautioned  that  Northcross  and  the\ni\nJ discretionary nature of fee awards do not require that awards\n; be  adjusted  for  inflation,  but  the  court  should  consider '\n1 whether  such adjustment  is called  for  in light of the facts\n1 1\nAO72A  e\n(Rtv.8/82)\n.— .CiMi- -~.-- »'*\n\nof  the case.  Louisville Black  Police Officers  v. City of\nLouisville,  700  F.2d  268, 274-75  (6th  Cir.  1983).  If  the\ncourt  determines  that  adjustment  for  inflation  is\nappropriate,  it  can  either  apply  a  current  hourly  rate  or\nenhance  the entire award by an appropriate  amount.  See id.\nat 275; Johnson v. University College of  the University of\nAlabama,  706  F.2d  1205, 1210-11  (11th  Cir.),  cert, denied,\n464 U.S. 994  (1983).  This court concludes that in this case,\nsome  adjustment  for  inflation  is appropriate  and  that using\nthe  current  market  rate  is  the  most  reasonable  method  of\ncalculating that adjustment.\nLMHA  suggests  that  even  if  the  court  awards  fees\nbased  on current hourly  rates, the fees should not be based\non current levels of experience.  For example, LMHA suggests\nthat  a  person  who  currently  has  ten  years  of  experience\nshould not be compensated at the ten-year level for work that\nhe performed fresh out of law school.  LMHA's argument is not\nsupported by caselaw, and it violates the animating principle\nof  the  fee  statute  of  encouraging  attorneys  to  take  on\ncomplicated  civil  rights  cases  such  as  the one  sub  judice.\nSee  Hensley,  461  U.S.  at  429  (§  1988  intended  \"to  ensure\n•effective  access to the judicial  process' for persons with\ncivil  rights  grievances\"  (quoting  H.  Rep.  No.  1558,  94th\nCong., 2d Sess. 1 (1976)).\nIn  cases  where  the  court  has  awarded  fees  at\ncurrent rates, the court generally does not differentiate as\nto levels of experience.  E.g., Gatreaux v. Chicago Housing\n1 2\nAO72A  ©\n(Rtv.8/82)\n,-i\\-  •'•.•*.. - '.•.*..•..*\n\nAuthority, 690 F.2d 6.01, 612 (7th Cir. 1982) (affirming a rate\nof $125.00 per hour for all services performed by an attorney\nover  a  fourteen-year  period),  cert,  denied,  461  U.S.  961\n(1983);  Akron  Center  for  Reproductive  Health  v.  City  of\nAkron ,  604  F.  Supp.  1275,  1288-92  (N.D.  Ohio\n1985)(compensating  attorneys  for  work  done over  seven years\nat an hourly fee based on levels of experience at time of fee\napplication).  The fact that  attorneys generally  take these\ncivil  rights cases without an expectation of payment unless\nthere  are victorious  is reason  to compensate  them  based  on\ncurrent  levels  of  experience.  The  court  in  Northcross\napproved  the  district  court's  consideration  of  the\ncontingency  of  compensation  as  a  factor  for  enhancing  the\nroutine hourly rate.  611 F.2d  at 638.  An attorney's hourly\nbilling  is based on the expectation of payment regardless of\nthe outcome of the case.  In contingency cases, where payment\nwill  only  be  had  in  the  event  of  victory,  an  upward\nadjustment  is appropriate to compensate the attorney for the\n..risk of not being paid  at all.  See Conklin v.  Lovely,  834\nF.2d 543, 553-54 (6th Cir. 1987)(approving enhancement of fee\nto compensate  for contingency element provided  that district\ncourt makes specific factual findings).  Northcross cautions\n. us,  however,  that  in  a  long,  complicated  lawsuit,  once\n\\ liability  is established,  the contingency  factor  disappears\nand  compensation  for  establishing  a  remedy,  monitoring  the\n/decree  and  recovery  fees  should  not  include  an  upward\n, adjustment for contingency.  Id.\n1 3\nAO72A  ®\n(Rtv.  8/82)\n^'sW-'?^*^^\n\nThis case was  filed  in 1974  and went  to trial  in\n1978.  Judge Young did not issue a decision until 1983, and\nhis  decision  was  affirmed  in part  and  reversed  in part  in\n1985.  An  affirmative  action  plan  was  created  in  1985  and\naffirmed with some exceptions in 1987.  LMHA's liability was\nnot settled  until the first appeal to the Sixth Circuit was\ndecided  in 1985.  The fee award should  therefore reflect the\ncontingent nature of the case during  the first eleven years\nof  the  case.  To  compensate  the  attorneys  based  on  their\ncurrent  levels  of  experience  will  best  accomplish  that\nadjustment.  See  City  of  Riverside  v.  Rivera,  106  S.  Ct.\n2686,  2692-93  (1986)(approving  award  where  district  court\ncompensated  attorney  at  prevailing  market  rate  even  though\nattorney was inexperienced when litigation began).\nAs  evidence  of  the  current  market  rate  for\nattorneys' services in Toledo, the plaintiffs submit the fee\nschedule  of  their  attorneys,  Advocates  for  Basic  Legal\nEquality  [\"ABLE\"] and  the affidavit  of Daniel J.  Steinbock,\nan associate  Professor  of Law  at  the University  of Toledo,\nwho studied the rates of attorneys in Toledo in March, 1988.\nABLE,  a nonprofit- corporation, employs  twenty-one  attorneys\nand has established the following schedule of fees.\nYEARS OF EXPERIENCE  HOURLY RATE\n0-2 $60\n3-5 $80\n6-10 $100\n11 and over $120\n1 4\nAO72A  ©\niBM^3MM^M^^^^M&. ;.M\n(R»v.8/82)\n\nlaw clerks  $30\nProfessor  Steinbock  states that among  medium-sized\nlaw firms in Toledo  (10-19 lawyers), the average hourly rate\nfor senior partners  is $120.00.  Among  larger  law firms  (20\nor more lawyers), the average hourly rate for senior partners\nif $124.00.  For junior partners, the average hourly rate at\nmedium-sized  firms  is $100.00  and  at larger  firms, $102.00.\nThe plaintiffs' request for $120.00 per hour for an attorney\nwith  more  than  eleven  years  of  experience  and  $100.00  for\nan  attorney  with  six  to  ten  years  of  experience  is  a\nreasonable  request  in  light  of  prevailing  market  rates  for\nattorneys with comparable experience in Toledo.\nAs a final matter, the court must determine whether\nliability  for  the  plaintiffs'  attorneys'  fees  should  be\napportioned  between  the two defendants, LMHA and HUD.  When\nthis  motion  for  an  interim  award  of  attorneys'  fees  was\nfiled,  the  issue  of HUD's  liability  had  not  been  resolved.\nThe plaintiffs, therefore, sought  fees only  from  LMHA.  In\nview of this court's determination that HUD is liable for the\nplaintiffs'  claims,  the  court  concludes  that  it  is\nappropriate to determine whether HUD should bear a portion of\nthe fees award.\nIn Council  for  Periodical  Distributors  Ass'ns  v.\nEvans,  827  F.2d  1483,  1487-88  (11th  Cir.  1987),  the  court\nstated that the district court has discretion whether and how\nto divide liability for fees.  In cases where the defendants\nparticipated  equally  in the wrongdoing,  the  court  may  hold\n1 5\nAO 72A  ©\nmtv.8/82)\n\nthe defendants jointly and severally liable for fees, or the\ncourt may divide the fees equally among the defendants.  Id.\nat  1487; Grendel's  Den,  Inc.  v.  Larkin,  749  F.2d  945, 959\n(1st Cir. 1984).  Fees may also be divided  according  to the\nrelative culpability of each defendant.  Evans, 827 F.2d  at\n1488;  Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d  at 960; Jose P. v. Ambach, 669\nF.2d  865, 871  (2d Cir. 1982).  It may also be appropriate to\napportion  fees according  to the amount of time spent by the\nplaintiff  in  preparing  the  case  against  each  defendant.\nEvans,  827  F.2d  at  1488; Grendel's  Den,  749  F.2d  at  960;\nSoutheast  Legal  Defense  Group  v.  Adams,  657  F.2d  1118,\n1125-26  (9th Cir. 1981).\nSeveral factors influence this court's decision to\napportion fees.  First, HUD has been a defendant in this case\nsince 1975, and plaintiffs have expended considerable effort\nin proving HUD's participation and responsibility for illegal\ndiscrimination  in  public  housing  administered  by  LMHA  and\nfunded  by HUD.  Second,  in view  of  the fact  that LMHA  was\nresponsible  for  on-the-scene  administration  of  public\nhousing, LMHA assigned tenants to particular units, and LMHA\nmaintained  the  waiting  list,  while  HUD  provided  funds,\nauthorized  the three refusal policy, and exercised a general\nsupervisory  function,  LMHA  should  bear  more  of  the\nresponsibility  than  HUD  for  the  discrimination  and\nsegregation  in public housing.  See Evans, 827 F.2d  at 1487\n(\"[I]t may be appropriate  for a district court to apportion\nfees  between  the  active  instigator  of  a  wrong  and  a  more\n1 6\nAO72A  ®\n(Rtw. 8/82)\n..\n'iii. I v*J^^-^viSfewis&Sirttas^-S\n\npassive co-defendant -who had a more peripheral or ministerial\nrole in the wrong.\").\nIf  this  were  a  case  where  both  defendants\ncontributed equally to the injury suffered by the plaintiffs,\nthen the court would be inclined to apportion damages equally\nbetween the two defendants.  In this case, however, although\nHUD  has  been  found  to  be  liable  for  the  injury  to  the\nplaintiffs, the court  is satisfied  that LMHA  bears more of\nthe  direct  responsibility  for  the  plaintiffs'  injury.\nBecause the attorneys' affidavits do not reflect which hours\nwere  spent  preparing  the  case  against  which  defendant,  the\ncourt cannot apportion  fees on an hourly basis.  Therefore,\nthe  court  finds  that  LMHA  is  liable  for  two-thirds  of  the\nplaintiffs'  attorneys1  fees and HUD  is liable for  one-third\nof the fees.\n•  In holding  the United  States  liable for  fees,  the\ncourt may not compensate at a current hourly rate in order to\naccount  for  delay  of payment.  In Library  of  Congress  v.\nShaw, 106 S. Ct. 2957 (1986), the Court held that an award of\nattorneys' fees against the United States, pursuant to Title\nVII  of  the .Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  may  not  compensate\nattorneys  at  current  hourly  rates  in  order  to  account  for\ndelay  of  payment  because  the  no-interest  rule  renders  the\nUnited  States  immune  from  an  award  of  interest,  in  the\nabsence  of  express  congressional  waiver  of  that  immunity.\nCompare  Loeffler  v.  Frank,  108  S.  Ct.  1965,  1974\n(1988)(holding  that  interest  may  be  awarded  against  Postal\n1 7\nAO72A  e\n(Rtv.8/82)\n\nService because in creating the Postal Service Congress \"cast\noff  the  cloak  of  sovereignty  and  assumed  the  status  of  a\nprivate commercial enterprise\"  (quoting Library of Congress\nv. Shaw, 106 S. Ct. 2957, 2963 n.5  (1986)).  Because there is\nno express waiver of the United States' immunity with respect\nto  interest  in  §  1988, the court  concludes  that  as  to  the\nnumber  of  hours  for  which  HUD  is  liable,  plaintiffs'\nattorneys may not be compensated at the current hourly rate.\nThe  court  does  not  have  sufficient  evidence  to  set  a\nreasonable hourly rate for the years 1974 to 1978 and 1983 to\n1987.  The  parties  will,  therefore,  supply  the  court  with\nsuch evidence according to the schedule set forth below.\nThe  plaintiffs  have  claimed  that  their  attorneys\nspent  2589.45  hours  on  their  case  up  to  September,  1988.\nThis  figure  will  be  reduced  by  198  hours  to  account  for\nduplicative  services  and  an  excessive  number  of  hours  in\npreparing post trial briefs.  The remaining number of hours,\n2391, will be reduced by twenty-five  (25%) to account for the\nplaintiffs' partial success.  The reasonable number of hours,\nrounded  to  the  nearest  hour,  is  therefore  1793.  LMHA  is\nliable for 1195 hours and HUD is liable for 598 hours.  The\nreasonable hourly rate for those hours assessed against LMHA\nis $120 per hour for hours worked by attorneys with more than\neleven  years  experience  (1018 hours)  and  $100 per  hour  for\nhours worked  by attorneys with six-to-seven-years  experience\n(177  hours).

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nWESTERN DIVISION\nINDIA GRAYSON, et al., \nPlaintiff, Case No. 3:74 CV 68\n-vs-\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nTOLEDO METROPOLITAN\nHOUSING AUTHORITY, et al., \nDefendant.\nKATZ, J.\nA class of plaintiffs brought this action in 1974, alleging the defendants Lucas Metropolitan\nHousing Authority (then the Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority) and United States Department of\nHousing and Urban Development were segregating minorities from non-minorities when building and\ndoling out housing. The Court found for the plaintiffs and entered an order that mandated adherence to an\nAffirmative Action Plan (AAP) designed to correct these practices and undo their effects. A series of\nappeals and later entries served to both uphold and hone the plan’s language. The Court recently approved\na class substitution, entering India Grayson as a named plaintiff in lieu of Josie Jaimes, the former named\nplaintiff. Doc. 263. Ms. Grayson has filed a motion to modify the AAP and the Court issued an order on\nthreshold issues, Doc. 259, clearing the way to address Ms. Grayson’s motion to modify. The three parties\nhave stipulated to certain facts upon which the Court will rely. Doc. 266. Both LMHA and HUD oppose\nMs. Grayson’s proposed modification. \nMs. Grayson takes a broad look at public housing in Lucas County and asks the Court to create a\nnew AAP that addresses the realities LMHA and HUD face today, such as the fact that some, but not full\nprogress has been made towards racial integration; LMHA has shifted to a stronger focus on administering\nSection 8 (the housing choice voucher program); the racial makeup of public housing tenants has changed;\nand LMHA is rebuilding and repurposing inner city housing projects that were central to the original racial\nsegregation finding. Ms. Grayson asks the Court to modify the AAP to account for and monitor progress in\n\nthis changing landscape. Only two narrow avenues exist for modifying the former judgment of the Court.\nFirst, when it created the AAP, the Court carved in a modification tool: the AAP could be modified either\nby agreement of the parties or when one party can show the Court that progress towards the plan’s\nobjectives is no longer being made. Second, the Court has the power under FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL\nPROCEDURE 60(b) to relieve a party from a judgment for a variety of reasons, including when the\nprospective application of that judgment is no longer equitable. These two avenues overlap significantly,\nbut neither party has provided the Court with authority that would indicate that to “relieve a party” could\ninclude revising a plan to impose new restrictions on that party. In other words, neither party has provided\nthe Court with authority demonstrating that a plaintiff can move under Rule 60(b) to make a judgment more\nstringent upon a defendant, which is exactly what Ms. Grayson requests. Since the Court’s own order has a\nprovision for modification, the Court need not resolve the Rules question and can just apply the order’s\nprovision to determine if modification is appropriate. \nBy the terms of the Court’s prior order, Jaimes v. Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority, No. 74-\n68, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12980 (December 10, 1985), Ms. Grayson, as the movant, must demonstrate\nthat progress is not being made toward achieving the objectives of the AAP, of which there are three:\nreducing racial segregation in LMHA projects, remedying the effects of past discrimination, and assuring\nequal access to housing. Id. at 16. Ms. Grayson has also asked the Court to determine whether the AAP has\nachieved the Court’s goals. See e.g., Doc. 240 at 2; Doc. 246 at 2. In 1985, the Court said that the objective\nof remedying past discrimination “shall be achieved” by maintaining each family public housing location\nbetween 72.5% - 76.5% minority and 22.5% - 26.5% non-minority and each senior housing location\nbetween 47.5% - 52.5% minority and 47.5% - 52.5% non-minority. Id. at 16 (expressing this as a 3:1 ratio\nin family housing and a 1:1 ratio in elderly housing, with 2.5% variance in either direction). The record\nshows that, at best, two family locations and one elderly location are within these narrow bands. Doc. 266.\nHUD and LMHA have not moved the Court to modify or terminate the plan based on a theory that,\n2\n\nnotwithstanding the racial makeup being outside the bands, they have met the general objectives of the plan\nand are entitled to termination of the plan. See id. (“C. The Plan shall continue until its objectives are\nachieved.”). There is no value, then, in the Court making a concrete determination that HUD and LMHA\nhave not met the objectives of the plan, as Ms. Grayson requests. The inquiry turns entirely on whether Ms.\nGrayson can show that modification of the plan is appropriate because “progress is not being made toward\nachieving the objectives of the Plan.” Id.\nMs. Grayson asks the Court to create a new plan that encompasses LMHA’s handling of Section 8\nvoucher programs. During the last two decades, HUD has shifted to favoring Section 8 vouchers as the\nneed for public housing has increased and public housing agencies nationwide have demolished aging\npublic housing projects without replacing them, instead moving people into voucher-based housing.\nBecause of this, the nature of LMHA’s work has changed much since Ms. Grayson’s predecessor filed this\ncase in 1974. Yet Ms. Grayson’s request to include Section 8 administration in a revised AAP oversteps\nthis Court’s authority. The Court’s role is limited to enforcing federal law when it must and returning\nauthority to the locally accountable officials when it can. Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 450 (2009)\n(analyzing the Equal Education Opportunity Act and finding that institutional reform litigation must be\nflexible to account for changing circumstances, but must also be keen to respecting federalism concerns and\nthe ultimate goal of returning authority to the local governmental unit when the violation of federal law is\ncured); accord United States v. Tennessee, 615 F.3d 646, 652 (6th Cir. 2010) (“federal encroachment upon\nstates' rights is more likely to occur in institutional reform litigation [so,] courts must take a ‘flexible\napproach’ to Rule 60(b)(5) motions addressing such decrees.” (quotations omitted)). \nIn this case, the Court created the AAP because it found racial segregation in public housing\nprojects and created a judicial solution to remedy that. “The evidence in the case also is overwhelming that\nthe defendants, since the time of the Vann decision have, by selecting sites for new housing developments\neither in racially concentrated or racially impacted areas, or in census tracts on the fringes of those areas, or\n3\n\nthat were obviously changing from non-impacted to impacted, acted in a manner which totally belies their\ndeclaration of [non-segregation] policy.” Doc. 88 at 11-12. This Court and the Court of Appeals were\naware that LMHA administered Section 8 housing, but the ultimate AAP did not include a mandate\ndirecting LMHA’s Section 8 administration. Of course, the Court’s original injunction included a ban on\nengaging in any discriminatory housing practices, and this would include LMHA’s administration of\nSection 8 housing, but the AAP focuses exclusively on housing projects. The Court of Appeals explicitly\nstruck provisions of the District Court’s order that could have been broadly interpreted and left the more\nspecific foundation that became the AAP and controls public housing projects. See Doc. 117 at 41 (“We set\naside . . . the court’s injunction and direction for submission of affirmative action plans, except for Part IX\nand paragraph a. of part VI of the trial court’s judgment order and REMAND the cause for further\nproceedings in conformity with this opinion.”). This Court of Appeals’ remand led to the Court’s adoption\nof the AAP, and that did not include a mandate for administering Section 8 voucher programs. If Ms.\nGrayson could show (and she has not even asserted this) that LMHA was using Section 8 vouchers in a\nway that worsens the segregation in public housing projects, then the Court could consider broadening the\nAAP to prevent that. But, simply noting that the Section 8 program is itself a difficult program to\nadminister fairly does not broaden the Court’s power to include the administration of Section 8 housing in\nthe AAP. Except when a plaintiff shows a violation of federal law and the court remedies it with an order\n(see, e.g. Horne, 557 U.S. at 450 (“It goes without saying that federal courts must vigilantly enforce federal\nlaw and must not hesitate in awarding necessary relief.”)), comity and federalism demand that courts must\ndefer to local officials to implement programs that adhere to the law. Id. Therefore, the Court cannot grant\nMs. Grayson’s request to broaden the AAP to include LMHA’s administration of Section 8 vouchers.\nThe Court’s 1985 order implementing the AAP after remand from the Court of Appeals, 1985 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 12980 at 15-29, defines the Plan’s objectives in (I)(A) and (B). Succinctly, they are: (1) to\nreduce racial segregation in LMHA projects, (2) to remedy the effects of past discrimination, and (3) to\n4\n\nassure equal access to housing opportunity without regard to race, color, or national origin. The AAP\nallowed that the objective of remedying past discrimination would be achieved if all the housing projects\nwere within a narrow band of ratios between minority and non-minority residents (between 72.5% - 76.5%\nminority and 22.5% - 26.5% non-minority in family housing and between 47.5% - 52.5% minority and\n47.5% - 52.5% non-minority in elderly housing (expressed as ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 with plus or minus 2.5%\nconsidered on-target)). The first and second objectives merge in the plan; that is, the remedy for past\ndiscrimination that caused segregation is, under the plan, to reduce segregation going forward. The third\nobjective is sometimes in tension with the first two because LMHA must exert some influence on residents\nto get them to move in certain directions based on their race (to end up with evenly desegregated projects).\nThe AAP narrowly walks between these objectives, which are sometimes in tension, dictating how LMHA\ncan allocate its units.\nThe 1985 order provided for modification by agreement (and the parties are not in agreement) or\nmodification when any party can show that progress is no longer being made under the plan. Therefore, the\nCourt’s narrowly defined task is to determine if Ms. Grayson can show that progress is not being made\ntowards achieving these objectives. In support of her position, Ms. Grayson can show that the 3:1 ratio has\nnot been met in all the family housing and the 1:1 ratio has not been met in all the senior housing. She also\ncan show that many individual projects have had some, but not enough, progress towards desegregation.\nThe ratios (3:1 for family housing and 1:1 for elderly housing) are, to an extent, red herrings. The\nlanguage of the Court’s 1985 order (1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12980 at 16) allows that, “[t]he objective of\nremedying past discrimination shall be achieved and maintained so long as [the ratios are attained and\nmaintained].” Yet, remedying past discrimination is only one of three discernible objectives of the original\nplan, and this ratio language does not preclude meeting this objective or the other two objectives by other\nmeans. Most importantly, the stipulated facts show that the ratio of non-minorities in the LMHA system\nhas dropped; family housing is now around 21% non-minority and elderly housing is now around 39%\n5\n\nnon-minority. To compel LMHA to move towards 25% non-minority residents in every family housing\nproject and towards 50% non-minority residents in every elderly housing project may effect the precisely\nopposite outcome as is desired. Because the wording of the AAP does not strictly bind the Court to those\nratios and because the reality has changed, the Court will not require strict adherence to the outdated 3:1\nand 1:1 ratios.\nAs the Court seeks to determine whether progress is being made towards the plan’s objectives, it\nmust employ a method of measurement. Many ways of measuring desegregation success may exist, but two\nmeasures are worth noting. The first measure is ratios (although not the outdated ratios); in a perfectly\ndesegregated public housing system, the ratios in each location would be the same as the ratios in the\noverall system. That is, if non-minorities made up 20% of the residents in the overall system, then one view\nof desegregation would hold that each project would have 20% non-minority residents and 80% minority\nresidents. This method of measuring is reflected in the Court’s 1985 order noting that desegregation will be\nconsidered achieved when the ratios are 3:1 and 1:1 (the then-accurate reflection of the makeup of the\nLMHA population at large). Another measure is whether any applicant can live wherever he desires,\nwithout regard to his race. This, of course, is both a measure of desegregation and a worthy goal of\ndesegregation, but itself may lead to more segregation (that is, if individuals use their freedom to choose\nlocations where their own race predominates). Further, practicality hampers this method; in Lucas County,\nthere is an extensive waiting list for public housing. When a resident does not get into his desired location,\nit may be a reflection of that resident’s need for immediate housing more than a poor reflection on\ndesegregation efforts. For example, a minority applicant may not end up living in a predominantly non-\nminority location because his strong need for housing left him with no other choice than to take the first\navailable unit rather than waiting months or years for an opening in his desired location. This, then, reflects\nthe sad reality of a heavily burdened public housing system in general, not that system’s ability to\ndesegregate its properties.\n6\n\nBecause of the complex realities, the Court has not discovered – and the parties have not suggested\n– a better measuring device than examining the contrast between the overall ratios and the ratios in each\nlocation. This carries with it the risk that it could motivate LMHA to “teach to the test,” taking steps\nnecessary to bring the ratios in line at the expense of other objectives. Yet, as was the case in 1985 and is\nstill the case today, courts like tangible, quantifiable measuring tools and checking the ratios grants exactly\nthat. Even if ratios are a good measuring tool, the 1985 ratios (3:1 and 1:1) are no longer a fair measure of\nsuccess. The parties have stipulated that today, non-minorities comprise 20.6% of family locations and\n29.1% of elderly locations. To grade LMHA on whether they met the long-outdated 3:1 and 1:1 ratios\nwould be unfair and is not required by the text of the 1985 order for a number of reasons, including the fact\nthat LMHA is not asking the Court to deem the desegregation task complete.\nMs. Grayson lists four projects that were nearly all minority when they began and today remain\nbetween 88% and 95% minority. She says, “[t]he projects that LMHA built for black people are still the\nprojects for black people.” Doc. 269 at 8. LMHA notes that it is in the process of tearing down and\nrebuilding three of these four projects. Ms. Grayson also points to two other projects that began with\nlopsided ratios and have only made modest progress in the last 23 years. LMHA counters that it has made\nsignificant progress in moving ratios at many of its projects, including the six that Ms. Grayson uses to\nillustrate her point. Not achieving a perfect balance indicates desegregation is a task complicated by many\nrealities, LMHA says, and does not indicate that it is not making progress.\nSince Ms. Grayson has taken on the burden of showing that progress is not being made and is\nattempting to do so by sampling the changes in ratios in certain projects, and since LMHA is answering\nwith a different interpretation of the same data, the Court will analyze that data more thoroughly. If proper\ndesegregation is achieved by moving every project’s ratio towards the overall system’s ratio, then any\ngiven project is, by definition, more segregated the further it moves from the system-wide ratio. Tracking\nhow far each project is from desegregation is possible by measuring the difference between the system’s\n7\n\nratio (plus or minus 2.5%) and the project’s ratio. Using the data stipulated by the parties, each project’s\npoints away from the system-wide ratio can be calculated in 1989 and 2011:\nElderly Housing Projects\n1989 2011\nSystem-wide non-minority: System-wide non-minority:\n59.4% 29.1%\nProject\nRange: 56.9 – 61.9 Range: 26.6 – 31.6\nPercent non- Points away Percent non- Points away\nminority from range minority from range\nHarry Hansen (007) 64.5 2.6 25.0 1.6\nSpeiker Terrace (009) 87.5 25.6 39.6 8\nVistula Manor (012) 55.3 1.6 27.0 0\nGlendale Terrace (013) 81.4 19.5 38.3 6.7\nOak Grove Elderly (014) 25.0 31.9 50.0 18.4\nRichmar Manor (015) 65.9 4 64.6 33\nParqwood Apartments (020) 9.3 47.6 11.3 15.3\nFlory Gardens (021) 27.3 29.6 24.4 2.2\nTeneyck Tower (030) 26.2 30.7 24.6 2\nRobert Dorrell (032) 65.0 3.1 44.0 12.4\nAshley Arms (038) 17.9 39 17.1 9.5\nTotal points away from range 235.2 109.1\n8\n\nFamily Housing Projects\n1989 2011\nSystem-wide non-minority: System-wide non-minority:\n21.2% 20.6%\nProject\nRange: 18.7 – 23.7 Range: 18.1 – 23.1\nPercent non- Points away Percent non- Points away\nminority from range minority from range\nBrand Whitlock Ext (002) 3.6 15.1 4.4 13.7\nRavine Park Village (003) 17.3 1.4 35.4 12.3\nAlbertus Brown (004) 0 18.7 8.1 10\nPort Lawrence Homes (005) 0 18.7 11.8 6.3\nBirmingham Terrace (006) 18.5 0.2 34.5 11.4\nBrand Whitlock (008) 1.1 17.6 5.1 13\nPulley Homes (010) 4.5 14.2 28.9 5.8\nNorthern Heights 17 (017) 14.3 4.4 20.7 0\nNorthern Heights 19 (019) 6.7 12 9.1 9\nElmdale Courts (023) 17.9 0.8 20.6 0\nScattered Sites 28 (028) 0 18.7 17.4 0.7\nJohn Holland (031) 7.5 11.2 9.5 8.6\nOak Grove Rental (036) 3.3 15.4 45.8 22.7\nJade Estates (041) 17.0 1.7 19.1 0\nTurnkey County Willow Bend (044) 12.5 6.2 12.5 5.6\nWeiler Homes (001) 29.2 5.5 22.8 0\nDevonshire (042) 29.5 5.8 32.2 9.1\nMarsrow Acres (043) 33.3 9.6 40.0 16.9\nHouck Town Homes (049) No data No data 20.0 Not calculated\nMcClinton Nunn (011) 0.8 17.9 11.7 6.4\n201-Scattered Sites Zone 1 / \n8.3 10.4 0 18.1\n     Scattered Sites 233\n202-Scattered Sites Zone 2 / \n40.0 16.3 28.6 5.5\n     222 Scattered Sites\n203-Scattered Sites Zone 3 / \n40.0 16.3 14.3 3.8\n     223 Scattered Sites\n204-Scattered Sites Zone 4 / \n32.9 9.2 23.5 0.4\n     213 Scattered Sites\n205-Scattered Sites Zone 5 / \n31.1 7.4 25.8 2.7\n     211 Scattered Sites\n206-Scattered Sites Zone 6 / \nNo data No data 10.5 Not calculated\n     212 Scattered Sites\n206-Scattered Sites Zone 6 /\nNo data No data 12.5 Not calculated\n     213 Scattered Sites\nTotal points away from range 254.7 218.2\n9\n\nA sum of the points away from the system-wide ratio for both family housing and elderly housing\ndemonstrates that LMHA is making some progress towards desegregation (significant progress in elderly\nhousing, moderate progress in family housing). This has answered, in the negative, the question Ms.\nGrayson presented. That is, Ms. Grayson has not shown that progress is not being made towards\ndesegregation because the numbers show that between 1989 and 2011, LMHA made some progress. Some\nprogress is the opposite of no progress and no further analysis is needed of the stipulated data. Ms.\nGrayson’s motion to modify the AAP must be denied because she cannot meet the Court’s 1985 standard\nfor modification, namely, showing that progress toward the goal of desegregation is not being met.\nThe Court’s application of a specific mathematical formula used to analyze Ms. Grayson’s\ncontention that progress is not being made towards desegregation does not change the criteria established to\nalter the AAP. The criteria to modify the AAP in the future remains as the Court established it in 1985:\n“The Plan may be modified at any time by agreement of all the parties hereto, or when, upon motion of any\nparty at any time, it shall be made to appear that progress is not being made towards achieving the\nobjectives of the Plan.” 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12980 at 16. \nEven though Ms. Grayson has not carried the burden of showing progress is not being\nmade under the AAP, she has shown that the AAP is not well suited to contemporary realities. The\n3:1 and 1:1 ratios are long outdated. Furthermore, the practical application of waiting lists,\nresident preference, and LMHA’s shifting focus (to Section 8 and to rebuilding troubled projects)\nlikely means that LMHA could act in a completely fair, non-discriminatory, and non-\nsegregationist manner and still never reach the point where every project’s ratio was within 2.5%\nof the system-wide ratio. Most importantly, Ms. Grayson may soon be able to show LMHA’s\nprogress to be plateaued using the Court’s analysis and comparing more recent years rather than\nthe 22 year span the Court used based on the stipulated data. All this leaves the situation ripe for\nMs. Grayson and LMHA to collaborate on a revised AAP that addresses the need to continue the\n10\n\nhousing projects move toward desegregation while accounting for the modern realities and the\nexperience gained by implementing the AAP for more than two decades. If the parties consent, the\nCourt will assist in settlement negotiations.\nFor the reasons stated in this memorandum opinion, the plaintiffs’ motion to alter the\nAffirmative Action Plan (Doc. 231) is denied.\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n    s/ David A.

Young\nin  his  Memorandum  and  Order  of  December  10,  1985, to\neliminate  the unlawful  racial segregation of LMHA's  housing  *\nprojects.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed the Plan, \"with certain\nchanges,\"  as  a  permissible  means  of  remedying  past\ndiscrimination.  Jaimes  v.  Lucas  Metropolitan  Housing\nAuthority, 833 F.2d 1203, 1207 (6th Cir. 1987).  On June 6,\n1988,  LMHA filed this motion to modify the Plan.  This court\nheld  an evidentiary  hearing  on October  27, 1988, at which\nJaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority\nA(RtOv.7 2A 8/82©) •  ., ,v—.;^;C ; £;{t£;;!;:..;.:  ''  :;: '•'  • •:  PH-OH-001-005\n\nLMHA  argued  in  favor, of  the  proposed  modification  and  HUD\nargued  against  the proposed  modification.  The sole witness\nat  this, hearing  was  LMHA's  Director  of  Occupancy,  Linnie\nWillis.  Following  the  hearing,  both  parties  submitted\npost-hearing  briefs.  HUD  also  submitted  its own motion  to\nmodify the Plan.\nThe Plan currently provides that each applicant for\nLMHA  housing  is  offered  a  unit  in  a  location  where  the\napplicant's  race  does  not  predominate.  The  Plan  also\nprovides  that  \"[i]f  the applicant  refuses all units offered\nin  locations  in  which  his  or  her  race  does  not  so\npredominate, other  than for good  cause, the applicant shall\nlose his or her place and be placed at the end of the waiting\nlist.\"  Memorandum  and Order of December  10, 1985, at 15, 11\nII.F.  LMHA's  proposal  would  modify  11 II.F.  so  that  an\napplicant  who  refuses,  for  other  than  good  cause,  a  unit\noffered  in  a  location  in  which  his  or  her  race  does  not\npredominate,  would  be  removed  from  the  waiting  list.\nAlthough  the  plaintiffs  have  made  no  objection  to  this\nmodification, HUD does object.\nHUD's proposed modification concerns H III.C.  This\nparagraph  assigns  certain  priorities  to  different  types  of\napplicants or transferees.  Hardship transferees  (a transfer\nnecessary  to  place  a  tenant  family  in  a  dwelling  of\nappropriate  size  or  to  meet  a  compelling  medical  or\nemployment  need)  have  first  priority  in  the  assignment  of\nhousing units.  Integrative transferees  (a transfer to a unit\nAO73A  ©\n(Rtv.8/82)\n\nin  a  location  in  which  the  transferee's  race  does  not\npredominate')  have  second  priority-  Third  priority  is\nassigned to new applicants whose assignment will decrease the\nsegregation,  of  the  location  to  which  they  are  assigned.\nFourth priority  is given to new applicants whose  assignment\nwill  increase or not affect the segregation  of the  location\nto  which  they  are  assigned.  HUD's  proposed  modification\nwould  strike subparagraphs  3 and 4 of II III.C,  eliminating\nthe distinction between third and fourth priorities,  and add\na new subparagraph 3 as follows:  \"New applicants for housing\nshall have third priority in the assignment of dwellings and\nshall  be  offered  available  units  in  accordance  with  the\nprovisions of Paragraph II.D-E.\"\nHUD  also  suggests  that  the  Plan  be  modified  to\nstate that \"the Plan should end upon the court's finding that\nits  goal  has  been  accomplished  or  upon  a motion  of  either\nparty followed by a hearing on the issue.\"\nThe  reason motivating  LMHA's desire  to modify  the\nPlan  is  the  difficulty  LMHA  has  had  in  achieving  the\nobjectives  of  the  Plan.  As  stated  in  11 I.B.I,  \"lt]he\nobjective of .• remedying past discrimination shall be achieved\nand  maintained  so  long  as  the  ratio  between  minority  and\nnon-minority  occupants  of  family  housing  locations  is\napproximately  three  to  one  (3:1) and  in elderly  locations,\none to one  (1:1).\"\nThe  problem  facing  LMHA  stems, in part, from  the\nracial composition of the waiting  list.  Minority  applicants\nAO72A  e\n(Rtv.8/82)\n. . :. •,i^^^:^kJ^'w.£^^/^^l^^^xV!;^e^^^&-i.\n\ncomprise  two-thirds v.of. the  waiting  list.  Among  those\napplicants waiting  for  family housing,  the racial  imbalance\nis even .greater:  eighty-nine percent of such applicants are\nminority persons.  In order to work toward the Plan's goal of\na three to one ratio of minority  to white tenants, LMHA has\nbeen  preferring  white  applicants  to  black  applicants.  For\nexample, Ms. Willis testified  that  if a vacancy occurs in a\nproject  with  a percentage  of  minority  tenants  greater  than\nthe  Plan's  goal,  LMHA  will  offer  the  unit  to  several\nnon-minority applicants first, even if that requires skipping\nover  minority  applicants  to  reach  the  next  non-minority\napplicant on the list.  After two or three attempts to place\na  non-minority  applicant  in  the  available  unit,  LMHA  will\nthen offer  the unit to the person at the top of the waiting\nlist regardless of his or her race.  Because the waiting list\nhas  been  closed  for  several  years,  the  same  non-minority\napplicants,  even  when  they  are  moved  to  the  end  of  the\nwaiting  list  for  refusing  a  unit  without  good  cause,  are\nbeing offered and refusing units in projects where their race\ndoes not predominate.\n>\nThe  Sixth  Circuit  affirmed  the  Plc.n, noting  that\ny\nthe race consciousness of the Plan does not involve  reverse\ndiscrimination.  Jaimes, 833 F.2d at 1207.  Because the Plan,\nas written,  is facially  neutral,  it  neither  prefers  blacks\nover  whites  nor  whites  over  blacks.  Applying  the  strict\nscrutiny test of Wyqant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ, 476 U.S. 267\n(1986), the court concluded  that the Plan  imposes a minimal\nAO72A  ®\n(Rtv. 8/82)\n\nburden  on  the parties  involved  and  is, therefore,  narrowly\ntailored  to achieve its purpose.  Jaimes, 833 F.2d  at 1207.\nThe  Sixth Circuit cautioned, however, that the Plan's  three\nto  one  ratio  may  not  be  used  to  prefer  either  whites  or\nblacks  in obtaining public housing.  A ratio is permissible\nand desirable as a goal for integration, but it should not be\ninterpreted as a strict racial quota.  Id.  See also City of\nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 109 S. Ct. 706  (1989)(rejecting,\nexcept  in extreme cases, racial preferences or quotas).  It\nis therefore improper for LMHA to use the Plan's three to one\nratio to prefer white applicants over black applicants.\nThe  difficulty  in  meeting  the  Plan's  goal  of  a\nthree  to  one  ratio  in  family  projects  will,  in  part,  be\nalleviated by the reopening of the waiting list.  The waiting\nlist has been closed  because of the limited  number of units\navailable  and  the  high number  of  applicants  already  on  the\nlist.  It is understandable that LMHA is reluctant to reopen\nthe  waiting  list without  reducing  the  number  of  applicants\nalready on the list.  LMHA's proposal, therefore, to remove a\nperson  from  the waiting  list  who  refuses  a  unit  for  other\nthan good cause  in a project  in which his or her  race does\nnot predominate,  is a reasonable modification.  In view  of\nthe  fact  that  the  plaintiffs,  who  represent  those  persons\nseeking  unsegregated  public housing  in Lucas County, do not\noppose  LMHA's  proposed  modification,  the  court  therefore\naccepts LMHA's proposal and will so modify the Plan.\nAO72A  ©\n(R«v. 8/82)\nZ^i5fc&\n\nHUD,  LMHA's  co-defendant  in  this  case,  opposes\nLMHA's proposed modification.  HUD correctly points out that\nLMHA has been violating both the letter and the spirit of the\nPlan  by  preferring  white  applicants  to  black  applicants  in\nattempting to meet the Plan's goal of a three to one ratio in\nfamily  projects.  HUD's  counter-proposal  that  LMHA  simply\nadminister the Plan according to its terms, however, does not\ngo  far  enough  to solve LMHA's  dilemma.  If applicants  face\nthe choice of either  accepting a unit in a project  in which\ntheir  race  does  not  predominate  or  being  removed  from  the\nwaiting  list, they will be encouraged  to accept such a unit,\nand thus, help in achieving the Plan's goal of a three to one\nratio.\nThe court notes  that  the Plan currently  calls for\naffirmative action to market segregated  locations to persons\nwhose  race does not predominate.  See fl IV.A-E.  The court\nexpects  that  LMHA  will  seriously  pursue  such  marketing\ntechniques in order to achieve the goals of the Plan.\nThe Sixth Circuit has suggested  to this court that\nthe  Plan  be  amended  in  two  ways.  First,  the  Plan  should\nterminate  \"upon  the court's  finding  that  its goal  has  been\naccomplished  or upon a motion of either party  followed  by a\nhearing  on  the  issue.\"  Jaimes, 833 F.2d  at 1207.  Second,\nthe Sixth Circuit suggested  that this court order  \"an annual\nreview of the racial composition of all the housing projects,\nas  well  ass a  review  of  the  family  composition  within  the\nprojects, in order to determine which families were in units\nAO72A  ©\n(Rtv.8/82) .' • V:\"'M-\n-^ii,*'ir&£-i^S;\"S*iftJ^':*i*-Ss .£.-»•. ~^^^^  ---\"\n\nof appropriate size and which projects were ripe for further\nintegrative transfers.\"  Id.  This court concludes that both\nof these modifications would further the goals of the Plan.\nIt is therefore\nORDERED  that the Affirmative Action Plan contained\nin the Memorandum and Order of December 10, 1985, is modified\nas follows:\n51  II.F.  will  now  state:  \"If  the\napplicant  refuses  all  units  offered  in\nlocations  in which  his or  her  race does\nnot  so predominate,  other  than  for  good\ncause,  the  applicant  shall  lose  his  or -\nher place and be removed from the waiting\nlist.  . . .\"\n11 I.C.  will now state:  \"The Plan shall\ncontinue  until  the court  finds  that  its\ngoal  has  been  accomplished  or  upon  a\nmotion  of  either  party  followed  by  a\nhearing on the issue.\"\nA  new  51 VI. D.  will  be  added  and  will\nstate:  \"LMHA  shall  provide  the  court\nwith  an  annual  review  of  the  racial\ncomposition  of  all  the  housing  projects\nadministered by LMHA.\"\nFURTHER ORDERED that LMHA will file with the court\non or before August 1, 1989, the first annual report referred\nV  ?••  '•:;.\nAO72A  e\n(Rtv. 8/82)\n\nto in new fl VI.D. , showing the racial composition of all LMHA\nhousing projects as of June 30, 1989.\nRUCHARD B.

D.\nJanuary 14, 1977.\nGlenn G. Galbreath, Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, Inc., Toledo, Ohio, for plaintiffs; Michael W. Warren,\nNCDH, Washington, D. C., of counsel.\n26 *26 William M. Connelly, Toledo, Ohio, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nDON J. YOUNG, District Judge.\nThis cause comes before the Court upon motion by defendants Hills, Morrow, Lydens, and the United States\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (hereafter collectively HUD) to dismiss the complaint for lack of\nstanding and for mootness.\nHUD contends that plaintiffs lack standing because they have not alleged and cannot demonstrate a probability\nthat suburban communities would accept cooperation agreements with Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority\n(hereafter TMHA; recently renamed Lucas County Metropolitan Housing Authority) to build low-income housing\nunits in their communities. Because plaintiffs cannot do this, the Court cannot grant relief that would enable them\nto live in the suburban residential communities of Toledo. If the Court cannot grant the relief requested, HUD\nreasons, there is no justiciable case or controversy or, alternatively, plaintiffs incur no cognizable damage\nsufficient to confer standing upon them. To support this argument, the federal defendants rely on Warth v. Seldin,\n422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).\nPlaintiffs respond that the relief they seek is more than the execution of cooperative agreements with suburban\ncommunities; they seek to compel HUD to approve and implement a metropolitan dispersed-housing plan. Such\na plan would locate low-income housing in Toledo suburbs if HUD affirmatively acts, as the Fair Housing Act\nrequires, to eliminate racial housing patterns. The named plaintiffs are former residents of Toledo suburbs who\nhave been denied the opportunity to remain in these areas because existing low-income housing is located only\nin racially segregated neighborhoods in the central city.\nThe Court finds that the named plaintiffs have standing to bring this action because they have alleged immediate\nand personal injury to themselves resulting from the asserted illegal action or inaction of HUD. In Warth, supra,\nthe Supreme Court distinguished the precise circumstances of the instant action from the situation in the case\nthen before it. The Supreme Court acknowledged the standing of low-income, minority-group plaintiffs, to\nchallenge zoning restrictions that applied to particular housing projects designed to supply low-income housing. \nWarth, supra 422 U.S. at 507, 95 S.Ct. at 2209. Plaintiffs' standing in this case is even stronger in view of HUD's\nstatutory obligation to provide public housing on a non-discriminatory basis. Plaintiffs in this action are the actual\ntenant claimants who would concretely benefit from fulfillment of that obligation. See Simon v. Eastern Ky.\nWelfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 40-42, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976).\nIt is true that plaintiffs may be unable to demonstrate that suburban communities will in fact sign cooperation\nagreements for publicly financed housing, but to require plaintiffs do so here and elsewhere would impose an\ninsurmountable barrier to all litigation involving voluntary actions by non-litigant third parties. The purposes of the\nFair Housing Act must not be thwarted by erecting such a barrier to reviewing alleged violation of the Act.\n\nSecond, HUD contends that this action is moot because TMHA has attempted to obtain cooperation agreements\nfor low-income housing with out-lying communities, but these communities have declined to accept TMHA offers.\nTMHA's attempt to obtain cooperative agreements took the form of a letter of invitation dated September 10,\n1975, stating in part:\nIn order to place housing in your community it will be necessary to have an executed Cooperation\nAgreement. Enclosed is a HUD Form Cooperation Agreement which we would ask that you review\nand have executed by the appropriate officials in your community. The Department of Housing and\nUrban Development has placed a time limit of September 30, 1975, for execution of the\n27 Cooperation *27 Agreement so time is of the essence.\"\nHUD identifies no other efforts by TMHA to obtain cooperation agreements or to take other measures to locate\nlow-income housing in the suburbs in the absence of such agreements.\nIn spirit if not in substance the TMHA invitation to suburban communities to sign the agreements is an invitation to\ndecline the housing projects offered. The recipient of the letter is informed that he will be \"contacted\" to explore\nthe agreement further, but is presented with a flat twenty-day deadline in which to have appropriate officials\nexecute an enclosed HUD Form Cooperation Agreement. In a matter as legally complex and politically sensitive\nas the allocation of public housing, much more is required of all defendants to demonstrate best efforts than a pro\nforma letter of solicitation.\nHUD fails to identify any strenuous efforts on its own part to disperse public housing in out-lying communities.\nParagraph 35 of the complaint alleges that HUD has\nFailed and refused to take all necessary, appropriate and effective action to ensure that TMHA\nseek cooperation agreements and resolutions from the local governing bodies within its\njurisdiction and that public housing be located in the suburban communities . . . and [has] failed\nand refused to impose sanctions within [its] power to impose.\nThe complaint alleges that HUD has knowingly supported TMHA practices, producing housing units in racially\nsegregated and central city neighborhoods. More grave is the allegation that HUD has instructed TMHA not to\nseek cooperation agreements from other local governing bodies outside the City of Toledo. HUD has proffered no\nevidence that nullifies these allegations. This action is far from moot.\nTHEREFORE, for the reasons stated, good cause appearing, it is\nORDERED that the motion of the federal defendants to dismiss this action be, and it hereby is, overruled.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

There  are  questions  of  law  and  fact \n\\ \ncommon  to  thy-\\-   class.

FACTUAL  ALLEGATIONS \n18.  Lucas  County,  Ohio  is  composed  of  the  municipalities \nof  Toledo,  Sylvania,  ~1aumee,  and  Oregon,  the  villages  of  Ottawa \nHills,  Holland,  Whitehouse,  Waterville,  Berkey  and  Harbor  View, \nand  the  townships  of  Swanton,  Washington,  Jerusalem,  Waterville, \nSpencer,  Springfield,  Sylvania,  Monclova,  Providence,  Richfield, \nand  Harding. \n19.  In  19 70,  the  population  of  Lucas  County  't'Jas  484,370  ·· · \npersons:  427,541  (approximately  88%)  were  white;  54,694 \n(approximately  11%)  were  black;  and  2,135  (less  than  1%)  were \nMexican-American  or  other  minority  group. \n20.  The  population  of  Lucas  County  is  racially  segregated •. \nApproximately  97%  of  the  black  persons  and  about  86%  of  the  Mexican \nAmericans  and  other  minorities  who  reside  in  the  County  live  in \nthe  City  of Toledo  and  are  concentrated  in  limited  sections  of  it. \nThe  remaining  minority  group  members  reside  in  concentrated \npockets  in  other  parts  of  the  County. \n-6-\n\nCase: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 48  Filed:  06/18/75  7 of 14.  PageID #: 255\n21.  In  the  past  several  years,  employment  opportunities \nin  the  suburban  areas  of  Lucas  County  have  increased  at  a  rate \nfar  exceeding  the  rate  of  increase  for  the  City  of  Toledo, \nwhere  the  overwhelming  majority  of  blacks~ Mexican-Americans, \nand  other  minorities  reside. \n22.  The  racial  composition  of  the  public  schools  in \nLucas  County  reflects  the  racially  segregated  residential \npatterns  of  the  area. \n23.  TMHA  manages  approximately  3,000  units  of  public \nhou~ing in  the  City  of  Toledo.  These  dwellings  have  been \n~rovided under  cooperation  agreements  or  resolutions  with  the \nCity.  TJYLHA  :1.Be  also  entered  into  a  cooperation  agteemen t  with \nLucas  County  calling  for  100  units,  of  which  only  52  have  been \nerected.  All  family  public  housing  is  located  in  the  City  of \nToledo,  except  for  the  52  units  which  are  located  in  a \npredominantly  black  and  low-income  area  of  the  County  called \nSpencer  Sharples. \n24.  The  TMHA  waiting  list  for  family  public  housing \nunits  is  composed  of  about  1~800 applicants,  two-thirds  of  whom \nare  blacks  and  Mexican-Americans. \n25.  In  the  past,  TMHA  has  maintained  policies  and \npractices  of  racial  discrimination  and  segregation  in  the \nadministration  and  opera~ion of  its  public  housing  program. \n26.  Tl'lfH.A ~ R  pa.::1t  ;;>·olicies  and  pract:.tces  have  contributed \nsubsta.ntially  to  the  racially  segregated  cha:racter  of  Lucas  County. \n27.  There  is  a  substantial  need  in  all  areas  within  the \njuris diet ion  of  TMHA  for  d·:c:!\".!en t,  safe,  and  sanitary  lo~:r-income \nhousing  \"t(l'hid1  ;;-:: i.r~.i:r:<.>:tf.ia  and  the members  of  their  class  can  afford. \n28.  Bef.:;re  TMHA  may  construct  or  acquire  low-income \nconventional  public  housing,  it must  enter  into  a  cooperation \nagreement  with  the  governing  body  in  whose  jurisdiction  the \nproject  is  to  be  located.  There  are  presently  conventional \nfamily  public  housing  units  under  reservation  from  HUD  to  TMHA. \n-7-\n\nCase: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 48  Filed:  06/18/75  8 of 14.  PageID #: 256\n29.  In  August  1974,  Congress  enacted  the  Community \nDevelopment  Act  of  1974  (Public  Law  93-383)  which,  ~i~n_t_e_r ~~ \nincludes  a  new  lo,;v- income  pub lie housing  program· commonly \nreferred  to  as  Section  8.  Under  the  Section  8  program,  42  U.S.C. \n1437  f.,  TMHA  may  participate  as  both  an  administrator  and \ndeveloper. \n30.  Beginning  in  1972,  TMHA  has  been  asked,  through \noral  and  ~-Tritten  communications,  to  seek  cooperation  agreements \nand  authorizing  resolutions  from  each  of  the  governing  bodies \nin  Lucas  County.  Despite  these  requests,  Defendants  refused \nand  failed  to  seek  coope:cation  agreements  and  resolutions, \nand  have  refused  and  failed  to  take  all necessary  steps  to  locate \npublic  housing  outside  the  City  of  Toledo.  Without  such \nagreements,  T}ffiA  is  precluded  from  constructing  or  acquiring, \nconventional  public  housing  outside  the  City  of  Toledo. \n31.  HUD  provides  financial  support  to  TMHA  in  the  form \nof  l·oans  and  annual  contributions  for  the  administration  and \noperation  of  the  TMHA  public  housing  program.  In  addition \nto  this  financial  support,  HUD  also  has  responsibility  for \nreviewing  and  approving  all  policies  and  practices  of  TMHA \nin  the  administration  and  operation  of  its  public  housing \nprogram,  including  policies  and  practices  relating  to  tenant \nassignment  and  site  selection. \n32.  In  the  past,  HUD  has  knowingly  approved  and \nfinancially  supported  TMHA's  policies  and  practices  of  racial \ndiscrimination  and  segregation  in  the  administration  and \noperation  of  the  TMHA  public  housing  program. \n33.  Under  Title VIII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1968, \n42  u.s.c.  3601,  ~~.,Title VI  of  the  1964  Civil  Rights \nAct,  42  u.s.c.  2000d,  Executive  Order  11063,  HUD•is-req:ilired \nto  ensure  that  its housing  and  urban  development  programs \nprovide  minorities  with  the  full  enjoyment  of  equal  housing \nopportunities.  HUD  has  failed  to  ensure  that  its  programs  are \n-8-\n\nCase: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 48  Filed:  06/18/75  9 of 14.

Defendants  HUD,  Hills,  Morrow,  and  Lydens  have \nfailad  and  refused  to  take  ail necessary,  appropriate  and \neffective  action  to  ensure  that  TMHA  seek  cooperation  agreements \nand  resolutions  from  the  local  governing  bodies  within  its \njurisdic~ion and  that  public  housing  be  located  in  the \nsuburban  communities  of  said  jurisdiction pursuant  to  Title VIII, \n~~ · ~fh·el~~~.t·. ~fP#t-~ .. t~~ 9f, ·}?.~§ ~  ~~ ~' ~ ~ c 7 , ~~O! .. .=.;.  :se~ ~--'. ~i.tle: vr \nof  the  1964  Civff R~ghts Act,  42  u.s.c.  2000d,  and  the  regulations \npromulgated  pursuant  thereto,  and  have  failed  and  refused \nto  impose  sanctions  within  their  power  to  impose. \n36.  Defendants  HUD,  Hills,  Morrow,  and  Lydens  continue \nto  advance  money  and  encourage  T]).1HA  to  advertise  for  family \npublic  housing  units  inside  the  City  of  Toledo,  while  at  the \nsame  time  they  have  instructed TMHA  not  to  seek  cooperation \nagreements  and  resolut~ons from  the  other  local  governing  bodies \nwithin  its  jurisdiction. \nVII.

Basically, the allegations are that the Toledo Metropolitan Housing\nAuthority, now the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority (\"LMHA\"), as owner and operator of some 3000 units of\npublic housing, has engaged in past de jure\nsegregation, has failed to adequately correct this past illegal conduct, and continues to countenance segregation\nin its public housing. More specifically, plaintiffs allege that LMHA not only has actively discriminated in the\nadministration and operation of its existing housing, but has also made a concerted effort to place public housing\nin predominantly minority areas.\nPlaintiffs are four low-income minority individuals. The district court certified them to represent a class of\nindividuals including\nall low-income minority persons residing in the Toledo metropolitan area who, by reason of their\nrace and poverty are unable to secure decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the Toledo\nmetropolitan area, at rents or prices they can afford without assistance from the Toledo [now\nLucas] Metropolitan Housing Authority, and who would like to have the opportunity to live in public\nhousing in suburban communities outside the City of Toledo.\n\nThis case was conditionally certified in April of 1975, at which time the United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (\"HUD\") was also joined as a defendant. The case was tried in January of 1978, and over\nfive years later, on May 12, 1983, the district court rendered its opinion. The district court concluded that through\nthe efforts of both LMHA and HUD, there existed intentional discrimination and segregation. The court therefore\nordered injunctive and other equitable relief, and also awarded compensatory and punitive damages to three of\nthe four named plaintiffs.\nII.\n[1] [2]\nLucas County encompasses four separate municipalities,  six separate villages,  and several townships. In\n1970, the census reported 484,370 inhabitants of Lucas County. Of these, approximately 88 percent were white,\n1090 11 percent were black, and less *1090 than 1 percent were either of Mexican-American or some other origin.[3]\nAccording to the 1970 census report, approximately 97 percent of the black population and 86 percent of the\n[4]\nMexican-American population lived in the City of Toledo.  This is in contrast to the fact that in 1970, Toledo\n[5]\naccounted for only about 79 percent of the Lucas County population.\nLucas County, in 1970, was divided into 128 census tracts. Of these, 20 comprise what have been defined as\n[6]\n\"Black Impacted\" areas, while 35 comprise \"Minority Concentrated\" areas.  Some 54 census tracts have either\nno blacks or less than a 1 percent non-white population residing in them. The majority of white residents in the\ncounty reside in these areas, while the overwhelming majority of Lucas County blacks live in Black Impacted\nareas.\n[7]\nUntil 1953 LMHA exercised a de jure policy of segregation.  As a result, housing projects built during this time\nwere specifically built with no objective to bring about desegregation of public housing. Of the first seven projects\nbuilt, four were placed in that section of Toledo where most blacks lived, and three in the predominantly white\nsection of Toledo. Whites lived in the white section, and blacks lived in those units in the black section. Following\nthe advent of desegregation, however, projects were built in various other parts of the city. In the period from\n1953 to 1967, six projects were constructed. Four were built specifically for the elderly, while two others\naccommodated both families and the elderly. Only one of these latter two units was placed in a neighborhood\nwhere there was a minority concentration. From 1968 to 1977 fourteen more projects were developed. Six of\nthese were placed in Black Impacted areas.\nAlthough blacks and hispanics make up a small percentage of the Lucas County population, they have tended to\nmake up the majority of the tenants in the housing projects. Statistics reflect the fact that these minorities account\nfor approximately 40 percent of LMHA's elderly tenants and approximately 70 percent of LMHA's family tenants.\nMinority applicants make up approximately 65 percent of the LMHA waiting list. In LMHA's 1977 Report on\nOccupancy sent to HUD, more than three quarters of the project components were reported to be \"out of racial\n[8]\nbalance.\"  Several of the project components are occupied entirely or almost entirely by one race.\nHousing projects are not the only types of housing assistance available in Lucas County. Also available is\n[9]\n\"Section 8 Existing Housing.\"  Pursuant to this program a tenant is subsidized after obtaining living\naccommodations on his own in the private sector. Basically, HUD subsidizes the difference between what a\n1091 family can afford to pay, and what HUD determines to be a \"Fair Market Rent\" for the unit. The individual *1091\nmust locate the unit and must qualify for the program to receive the assistance. A different form of Sec-8 housing\nis \"New Construction Housing.\" Under this program, HUD enters into a long-term contract with developers who\ndevelop units and subsequently lease them to Section 8 tenants. Though this type of program is available, LMHA\nhas decided not to participate.\nPlaintiffs charge that the above alleged segregative effects are the direct result of discriminatory practices and\nactions employed by both LMHA and HUD. They claim first that LMHA and HUD intentionally placed the housing\nprojects discussed in minority areas of the City of Toledo and that this has prevented those seeking public\nhousing from enjoying the benefits available to persons not forced to live in minority areas. Second, plaintiffs\n\n[10]\nclaim that through the use of a \"three refusal\" procedure,  LMHA has allowed prospective tenants to choose in\nwhich project they wish to live. This allegedly fosters segregation.\nBoth LMHA and HUD deny any intent to segregate public housing. Both claim that the three refusal rule allows\nflexibility and gives prospective tenants, both minority and white, a limited freedom to choose where they wish to\nlive. Further, as to the contention that housing projects have been purposely placed in minority areas of the City\nof Toledo rather than in the suburbs, LMHA responds by pointing to the need in the city for adequate housing.\nLMHA claims that Toledo needs public housing more than any of the surrounding areas, and for that reason\nToledo has been the focus of the housing projects. Furthermore, it is uncontroverted that to place projects in any\n[11]\nparticular suburb, LMHA must obtain a \"cooperation agreement\" from the local government involved.\nAgreements for public housing projects have not been obtained from any of the suburban areas around Toledo\n[12]\nand therefore LMHA has not been able to provide public housing in these areas.\nTo support their position of intentional segregation within housing, and of intentional placement of housing in\nminority areas, plaintiffs make the following allegations: (1) ten of the twenty-seven projects are found in Minority\nConcentrated areas; (2) seven other projects were placed in so-called \"highly suspect\" areas, those adjacent to\nMinority Concentrated areas or those subject to minority migration; (3) three projects were built in areas\nimmediately adjacent to Minority Concentrated areas, and were only completed following the institution of\n[13]\nlitigation; (4) LMHA's past actions demonstrate a policy to discourage obtaining cooperation agreements.\nAs stated previously, the district court found intentional segregation on the parts of both LMHA and HUD. In part\nVI of its order the court enjoined the defendants from:\n1092 a. engaging, or continuing to engage, in any acts or practices which have the purpose *1092 or\neffect of denying equal housing opportunities because of poverty, race, color, religion, national\norigin, or sex;\nb. expending any monies, selling any bonds, entering into any contracts, or taking any other steps\nto construct or lease low-income housing in any areas which are, or soon may be, racially\nimpacted;\nc. [] failing or refusing to take any and all steps necessary, appropriate, or desirable to secure\ncooperation agreements from each and every municipal corporation in Lucas County which does\nnot presently have such an agreement;\nd. [] failing or refusing to take all possible actions to ensure that family public housing units are\nconstructed in each and all of the municipal corporations in Lucas County outside of the City of\nToledo.\nFurther, in part IX of its opinion it ordered LMHA and HUD to prepare and submit within 60 days a comprehensive\nhousing plan, along with an affirmative action plan to correct the past segregation. Also, consistent with\nparagraph d. of part VI of its order, the court in part VII directed that a plan be prepared for dispersal of\nsubsidized low-income housing throughout Lucas County. Finally, the court awarded both compensatory and\npunitive damages to three of the named plaintiffs. (Josie Jaimes and Tomas Gonzales were awarded $7200\napiece in compensatory, and $14,400 apiece in punitive damages; Patricia Davis Tarrie was awarded $6000 in\ncompensatory and $12,000 in punitive damages.)\nBoth LMHA and HUD appeal. They claim the court erred in finding intentional discrimination. Also, both argue that\n[14]\nthe court erred in the damage award.  Finally, both argue that the affirmative relief ordered by the court is too\nbroad and should be limited even if plaintiffs are entitled to relief. Before reaching these substantive arguments,\nhowever, we must first address the jurisdiction of this court to hear this case. Specifically, we must decide\nwhether plaintiffs have standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\nIII.\n\nA. STANDING\nEven if no party to this appeal has raised the issue of standing, this court can and must address the issue on its\n[15]\nown motion. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974); Eagerton v. Valuations,\nInc., 698 F.2d 1115 (11th Cir.1983). See C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1393 (1969).\nBefore a federal court accepts jurisdiction, a \"case or controversy\" must be established within the meaning of\nArticle III of the United States Constitution. Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26,\n96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976); Young v. Klutznick, 652 F.2d 617 (6th Cir.1981),cert. denied sub nom. \nYoung v. Baldrige, 455 U.S. 939, 102 S.Ct. 1430, 71 L.Ed.2d 650 (1982). In order to establish such a case or\ncontroversy, the named plaintiffs must be shown to have \"standing.\" Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans\nUnited for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982); Flast v.\nCohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968); Jacobs v.

Warth v.\nSeldin, 422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Federal courts then decide only those disputes\n1093 which are truly adversary, and refrain from making generalized decisions *1093 in abstract settings. As stated by\nthe Supreme Court just recently:\nthe \"case or controversy\" requirement defines with respect to the Judicial Branch the idea of\nseparation of powers on which the Federal Government is founded. The several doctrines that\nhave grown up to elaborate that requirement are \"founded in concern about the proper 00 and\n97\nproperly limited 00 role of the courts in a democratic society.\"\n97\nAllen v. Wright, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556,reh'g denied,468 U.S. 1250, 105 S.Ct. 51,\n82 L.Ed.2d 942 (1984) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. at 498, 95 S.Ct. at 2205).\nStanding in the constitutional sense consists of a three-part analysis. First, a party must allege and prove a\n\"distinct and palpable\" injury. Gladstone Relators v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 100, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1608,\n60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979). Second, this injury must be shown to be causally related to the complained-of conduct. In\nother words, a \"fairly traceable causal connection\" must exist between the injury and the defendant's alleged\nconduct. Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d\n595 (1978); Young v. Klutznick, 652 F.2d 617. Finally, assuming it is appropriate for the court to exercise its\nremedial powers, there must be a substantial probability that the claimed injuries will be redressed by taking the\n[16]\naction sought by the claimants. Simon, 426 U.S. 26, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976); see generally \n[17]\nLugo v. Miller, 640 F.2d 823, 827 (6th Cir.1981).\nEach plaintiff must be analyzed in the context of each alleged violation in order to determine whether he or she\npersonally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the alleged illegal or wrongful conduct. \nGladstone Realtors, 441 U.S. 91, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 60 L.Ed.2d 66; Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45\nL.Ed.2d 343. In the present case, ther are four named plaintiffs who have been certified to represent a broad\nclass of individuals. The class consists of those persons unable to obtain decent housing in Toledo, and who\nwould like to live in public housing in the Toledo suburbs.\nThat a suit may be a class action, however, adds nothing to the question of standing for even\nnamed plaintiffs who represent a class \"must allege and show that they personally have been\ninjured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they\nbelong and which they purport to represent.\"\nSimon, 426 U.S. at 40 n. 20, 96 S.Ct. at 1925 n. 20 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. at 502, 95 S.Ct. at 2207). \nSee also HOPE, Inc. v. County of DuPage, Illinois, 738 F.2d 797 (7th Cir.1984) (en banc).\nJosie Jaimes is a Mexican-American who, prior to the filing of this suit, resided with her six children in Sylvania, a\n1094 suburb of Toledo located in Lucas County. She allegedly *1094 had lived in Sylvania for 19 years up until the time\n\nher house was condemned, forcing her to move to a racially concentrated area of Toledo. Jaimes alleges that she\ncannot afford clean, safe, sanitary housing without the aid of LMHA, and that she has applied for LMHA aid and\nremains on a waiting list. At trial, Jaimes testified that she had in fact applied for housing with LMHA, but was\ninformed none existed in Sylvania. Also, Jaimes testified that she was not sure whether she remained on the\nLMHA waiting list because she had failed to contact that office in over two and one-half years. She did testify,\nhowever, that she went to LMHA a number of times seeking housing.\nTomas Gonzales occupies a similar position. He is a Mexican-American who had lived in Sylvania for twenty-two\nyears prior to the time his home was condemned, forcing his move to Toledo. He claims he would liked to have\ncontinued living there, but could not do so without LMHA assistance. He applied for LMHA housing and, pursuant\nto LMHA practice, was placed on a waiting list. At trial, Gonzales testified that when he applied for housing he\nwas informed none existed in Sylvania. Further, Gonzales testified concerning his continuing strong desire to live\nin Sylvania. Finally, Gonzales testified at trial concerning his present location in Toledo and stated that he would\ncontinue to live there if necessary to obtain public housing assistance.\nPatricia Davis Tarrie, a black female, resides along with her children in an LMHA housing project in Toledo. She,\ntoo, expressed a desire to live in the Toledo suburbs, yet claimed a need for LMHA assistance. At trial, she\ntestified that she had resided in LMHA housing for over 12 years, and during that time constantly sought larger\nliving quarters outside her location in the inner city. Tarrie also testified that the apparent reason for her inability to\nmove to a larger apartment within the LMHA system was the large number of applicants ahead of her on the\nLMHA waiting list.\nClarence Turner, a black male, is described as residing in LMHA public housing in a predominantly black\nneighborhood in Toledo. The complaint states that he works in Wood County, Ohio, and is forced to travel a long\ndistance to work because of his inability to afford housing there. He would like to live in Maumee, Ohio, but\ncannot do so without LMHA assistance. Turner did not testify at trial.\nEach plaintiff alleges that he or she \"would like to live in decent, safe and sanitary housing\" in the suburban areas\nof Toledo (Sylvania and Maumee are specified by three of the four), \"but were unable to afford such housing\nwithout the assistance of ... [the] Housing Authority.\" Plaintiffs further assert that a \"common question of law and\nfact is whether defendants' provision and location of public housing in the Toledo area has denied plaintiffs and\ntheir class their rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\"\nPlaintiffs' first and major contention is that LMHA and HUD have restricted public housing to the City of Toledo,\nand thus they are being deprived the opportunity to live in public housing in the suburbs. With the exception of\nthe alleged violations of Title VIII and of the Housing Act, the claims made here of racially discriminatory practices\nand actions are similar to those asserted in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343, and \nCounty of DuPage, 738 F.2d 797. Plaintiffs in both those cases, as here, were individuals purporting to represent\na larger class of minority persons with low incomes who were excluded from desired housing in suburban areas\n[18]\nbecause of acts and practices of county and local governmental entities and officials.  The acts and practices\nchallenged in Warth and in County of DuPage were claimed to be both discriminatory and exclusionary, and\n1095 intended to bar low income minority persons from adequate affordable *1095 housing in the suburban areas in\n[19]\ncontroversy.\nIn Warth the Supreme Court held that the individual plaintiffs lacked standing to make the constitutional and\nstatutory challenge therein asserted. In coming to this conclusion, the Court accepted as true factual allegations\nby the plaintiffs that zoning and other actions of Penfield and its agencies and officials \"had the effect of excluding\npersons of minority racial and ethnic groups,\" 422 U.S. at 496, 95 S.Ct. at 2204, and that Penfield's practices\n\"had prevented them [black and Puerto Rican plaintiffs and others] from acquiring ... residential property in the\n[20]\ntown, and thus had forced them and their families to reside in less attractive environments.\" Id.\nIn County of DuPage, 738 F.2d at 799, the plaintiffs charged the County, members of the County Board, and\nothers, with \"`exclusionary housing practices' which effectively denied adequate housing to racial minorities and\npersons with low or moderate incomes,\" and with \"a conspiracy to perpetuate the County's discriminatory\nhousing practices.\" (Footnote omitted). The district court found that taking these allegations as true \"absent the\n\nalleged discriminatory housing practices of the County and the developers, plaintiffs would have had a substantial\nprobability of acquiring adequate housing which they could have afforded,\" 70 F.R.D. 38, 46 (N.D.Ill.1976), and\nthus found standing. After a hearing, as in this case, the district court concluded that defendants \"had in fact\nknowingly and intelligently engaged in housing practices which were intended to and effectively did exclude\n[21]\npersons of low and moderate income and racial minorities from residing in the County,\"  and that plaintiffs'\n\"inability to secure housing in DuPage County is fairly traceable to the County's actions.\" See738 F.2d at 800.\nSitting en banc, the court of appeals reversed the district court and found that the plaintiffs had no standing to\npursue their claims.\nBefore proceeding to the substance of the standing issue, the County of DuPage court made note of the fact that\nstanding does not necessarily flow from the validity of the plaintiff's contention on the merits,\nrather the focus is on the plaintiff and whether he or she has alleged and proven facts necessary\nto meet the minimum constitutional requirements of standing.\nId. at 804 (citing Simon, 426 U.S. at 38, 96 S.Ct. at 1924). Thus, regardless of the validity of a claim, there can be\nno cause of action absent standing to assert that claim. Turning to the standing issue, the court found two main\nreasons for concluding no standing existed.\nThe plaintiffs' allegations and proof simply do not demonstrate that their alleged injuries \"`fairly\ncan be traced to the (County's) challenged action'\" nor that such injuries are \"`likely to be\nredressed by a favorable decision,'\" both of which are necessary to standing.\nId. at 811 (citations omitted).\nAs was recognized by the Supreme Court in Warth, and reiterated by the Seventh Circuit in County of DuPage,\n\"the availability of low and moderate income housing depends not only on zoning practices but also `on the\n1096 efforts and willingness of third *1096 parties to build low and moderate cost housing.'\" Id. It was also pointed out\nin County of DuPage, as in Warth, that plaintiffs pointed to no specific housing projects in which they personally\nintended to, or could afford to, live. There was no evidence in either case that the County (or City) officials ever\nspecifically discriminated against individual plaintiffs by denying them an opportunity to live in a particular house\nor project despite general allegations of exclusionary and discriminatory conduct and practices against racial\nminorities and low income persons.\nWe believe that the situation here involving the claims of plaintiffs Jaimes, Gonzales, Tarrie, and Turner is\ncomparable to that of the plaintiffs in Warth and in County of DuPage. The plaintiffs in County of DuPage also\nattempted in a class action complaint to establish standing under the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments, the\nCivil Rights Act, and Title VI, while in Warth the plaintiffs attempted the same under the first, ninth and fourteenth\namendments and the Civil Rights Act. In both cases the plaintiffs claimed discrimination with respect to being\nprevented from obtaining desired housing in suburban locations outside congested large cities. Plaintiffs here\nencounter the same problems in regard to standing as experienced by those plaintiffs.\nThe first step in any standing analysis is to isolate the asserted \"injury in fact.\" For our purposes, however, we will\nassume that injury, in whatever form, does exist and proceed to address the causation and redressability issues.\n[22]\nIt is conceded that for defendants to obtain and lease public housing units in a given incorporated area of Lucas\nCounty, they must obtain necessary approval by the local town or city. Even if it were taken as true that\ndefendants \"failed to seek\" such approval, it is still a matter of speculation and conjecture as to whether these\nthird party, non-defendant governments would grant approval for construction of units that plaintiffs could afford,\n[23]\nqualify for, or be eligible to obtain.  Plaintiffs have pointed to no specific proposed project, location or site that\n[24]\nmight have been approved in Sylvania or in Maumee.  There is no constitutional right of \"access to dwellings\nof a particular quality,\" nor is the \"assurance of adequate housing\" a constitutional mandate. Lindsey v. Normet,\n405 U.S. 56, 74, 92 S.Ct. 862, 874, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 (1972). Neither the type of low-rent public housing legislation\nhere involved nor the constitution requires that a local government accept aid for and approve public housing in a\n\nparticular location. James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137, 140, 91 S.Ct. 1331, 1333, 28 L.Ed.2d 678 (1971); Housing\nAuthority of Seattle v. Washington Dept. of Revenue, 629 F.2d 1307, 1309 (9th Cir.1980).\nIn analyzing the showing of standing to be made by plaintiffs in this type of claim, courts have looked to a\n1097 particular *1097 project or housing site which may have been affected by particular actions or failures to act on\nthe part of government entities or officials. Frustration in bringing a designated housing unit into being for the\nbenefit of a racial minority or a discrete class of poor persons, or discriminatory acts excluding poor persons of a\nminority race or nationality from a specified housing project or area may be the basis of standing in a complaint of\nthis kind if it is an indication of a particularized direct injury to the plaintiff. See Village of Arlington Heights v.\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). In Arlington\nHeights, the Court, in a situation differing from Warth, found that a plaintiff who sought to build or live in racially\nintegrated low-income housing on a particular parcel of land had standing, because\n[h]is is not a generalized grievance. Instead, as we suggested in Warth ..., it focuses on a\nparticular project and is not dependent upon speculation about the possible actions of third parties\nnot before the court.\n429 U.S. at 264, 97 S.Ct. at 563 (emphasis added).\nThere is no \"particular project\" in Sylvania or Maumee (or in Lucas County for that matter) pointed out by\nplaintiffs, who only indicate a general desire to live in public housing in these communities. Accomplishment of\nthis general desire is subject to \"speculative\" or \"possible\" actions of authorities in those particular locales, which\nare not defendants before the court.\nIn County of DuPage it was alleged that the County and its Board affirmatively discouraged private developers\nfrom building housing. The court found that this alleged wrongful conduct did not \"cause\" the plaintiffs' injury for\npurposes of Article III. No specific exclusion of any plaintiff could be shown. Likewise, in the present case, no\n[25]\nspecific project or act of exclusion can be demonstrated.  All that is alleged is that LMHA has failed to urge\nauthorities in certain localities here to allow public housing in these areas.\nSeparate and apart from the failure to demonstrate a fairly traceable causal connection between the alleged\ninjury and challenged conduct, plaintiffs also fail to show that assuming the relief they request is granted there is\na substantial probability that they will be able to move to the suburbs. See Duke Power, 438 U.S. 59, 98 S.Ct.\n2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595; Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450; Simon, 426 U.S. 26, 96\nS.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450. In Warth, the Court stated:\nWe hold only that a plaintiff who seeks to challenge exclusionary zoning practices must allege\nspecific, concrete facts demonstrating that the challenged practices harm him, and that he\npersonally would benefit in a tangible way from the court's intervention.\n422 U.S. at 508, 95 S.Ct. at 2210 (footnote omitted).\nThere is no attempted showing or allegation in this case that if the court grants plaintiffs' requested relief, they will\nbenefit in a \"tangible way.\" Assuming this court ordered LMHA to take affirmative action and apply to Sylvania\nand to Maumee for permission to build housing, there is no reason to expect that construction of public housing\nhas a substantial probability of ever taking place in either of these areas. Such municipalities are not required to\nprovide low-rent housing for its residents, nor certainly to non-residents on the basis of a generalized complaint of\na lack of low-rent or low-income housing. Ybarra v. Town of Los Altos Hills, 503 F.2d 250, 253 (9th Cir.1974). To\nbuild in the suburbs, LMHA must obtain cooperation agreements from the various local governments. These have\n1098 *1098 not been obtained in the past, and may not be obtained in the future. There is no allegation or indication\n[26]\nthat these local governments wish to have low income housing projects placed in their municipalities.  Again,\nthese suburban governments are \"third parties\" not before the court. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 504, 95 S.Ct. at\n2208.\nBesides the speculative nature of availability of cooperation agreements, other contingencies also exist which\naffect the standing of plaintiffs. Funds must be available to build the public housing projects; specific sites must\n\nbe located and approved within the suburbs to meet zoning requirements; and finally, for any named plaintiffs \npersonally to benefit in a tangible way, he or she must be found eligible for the project. There is no substantial\nprobability demonstrated that all these contingencies will be met in this case. See Evans v. Lynn, 537 F.2d 571\n(2d Cir.1975) (en banc), cert. denied,429 U.S. 1066, 97 S.Ct. 797, 50 L.Ed.2d 784 (1977); Topic v. Circle Realty\nCo., 532 F.2d 1273 (9th Cir.),cert. denied,429 U.S. 859, 97 S.Ct. 160, 50 L.Ed.2d 137 (1976).\nPlaintiffs, in their supplemental brief dealing with the question of standing, attempt to distinguish County of\nDuPage and Allen v. Wright, and characterize them \"as little more than reapplications of Warth v. Seldin....\" If,\nthen, Warth is applicable to the factual setting of this case, its reapplication is controlling, for its continuing validity\nhas concededly been reinforced in these other later decisions, even where the alleged discriminatory practices\nwere more pervasive.\nPlaintiffs cite NAACP, Boston Chapter v. Harris, 607 F.2d 514 (1st Cir.1979), in support of their contention that\nstanding exists. This case, however, involved detailed housing projects in Boston or the Boston area sought to be\nfinanced by HUD. The court held that minority plaintiffs who were concerned about racial segregation and its\neffects in Boston area public housing, who desired dispersion of housing units into non-minority housing projects,\nalready approved for funding, were in fact operated in a non-discriminatory fashion. Furthermore, Harris decided\nthat plaintiffs had only a limited and preliminary standing (akin to standing on the issues raised as to segregated\nunits being operated in Toledo, see infra p. 1101) and that the question of standing might further be definitively\ndetermined after considering proof and evidence. See also City of Hartford v. Glastonbury, 561 F.2d 1032, 1048\n(2d Cir.1976). Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority, 503 F.2d 930 (7th Cir.1974),aff'd sub nom. Hills v.\nGautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976), also cited by plaintiffs, involved approval of a\nremedy for desegregating public housing in Chicago by providing for various alternatives in a \"`comprehensive\nplan' ... including, if the parties deem it necessary or appropriate to provide full relief, alternatives which are not\n[27]\nconfined to the geographic boundary of the City of Chicago.\" 503 F.2d 939.  The Supreme Court affirmed the\nauthority of the district court to consider remedial action outside the city limits of Chicago, stating:\nAn order directing HUD to use its discretion under the various federal housing programs to foster\nprojects located in white areas of the Chicago housing market would be consistent with and\nsupportive of well-established federal housing policy.\n* * * * * *\n1099 An order directed solely to HUD would not force unwilling localities to apply for *1099 assistance\nunder the programs but would merely reinforce the regulations guiding HUD's determination of\nwhich the locally authorized projects to assist with federal funds.\n425 U.S. at 301, 303, 96 S.Ct. at 1548, 1549 (footnote omitted).\nIt should be noted that Gautreaux emphasized the effect of its decision by concluding:\nThe remedial decree would neither force suburban governments to submit public housing\nproposals to HUD nor displace the rights and powers accorded local government entities under\nfederal or state housing statutes or existing land-use laws.\n425 U.S. at 306, 96 S.Ct. at 1550. Standing was found as to those plaintiffs who were tenants and would-be-\ntenants of the Chicago Housing Authority, who challenged its practices causing segregation and the substantial\nunderrepresentation of blacks in that system. That case is thus not inconsistent with our holding today.\nWe recognize that Warth and County of DuPage involved neither a claim under Title VIII nor under the Housing\nAct. Here, HUD and its officials are sued under the Housing Act because HUD is alleged to be \"the principal\nsource of financial assistance for such [low-income] housing.\" The Housing Act, however, adds nothing more to\nthe substance of plaintiffs' claims. There is, then, no legal significance in the fact that the Housing Act was not\ninvolved in Warth and County of DuPage.\nThe amended complaint asserts the Title VIII claim as follows:\n\n33. Under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 3601, et seq., Title VI of the 1964\nCivil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, Executive Order 11063, HUD is required to ensure that its\nhousing and urban development programs provide minorities with the full enjoyment of equal\nhousing opportunities. HUD has failed to ensure that its programs are administered in an\naffirmative manner to achieve equal housing opportunities.\n34. In October, 1973, in response to an administrative complaint filed by individuals and various\nneighborhood organizations in the City of Toledo, officials in the HUD Columbus Area Office\ndetermined, inter alia, that the Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority should be seeking\ncooperation agreements from the local governing bodies within its jurisdiction.\n(Emphasis added). The claim under Title VIII, then, is tied in with the Title VI claim and is similar to the cause of\naction asserted in County of DuPage. It is directly related to the acknowledgement by plaintiffs that cooperation\nagreements were required to be obtained from local governing bodies or private third parties before any low-\nincome public housing units or assistance could be built or utilized in communities outside Toledo. Neither the\nTitle VIII claim nor the Title VI claim significantly adds anything of substance to the complaint. The reasons for\ndenial of standing under the constitutional claims and the Civil Rights Act, as exemplified in Warth and County of\nDuPage, accordingly apply equally to the claims here under Title VI, Title VIII, and the Housing Act.\nOther cases noted by plaintiffs in their supplemental brief on standing involve specific projects or sites rejected\nfor racial reasons. No third persons who had the authority to act and yet who were not before the court were\n[28]\ninvolved in those cases.  These cases, then, are distinguishable from the situation here insofar as plaintiffs\ngenerally seek low-rent public housing to be afforded them in the Toledo suburbs, particularly Sylvania and\nMaumee.\n1100 *1100 With respect to Section 8 Existing Housing, the situation differs to a certain extent. Under this housing\nprogram, prospective tenants seek out willing landlords, and assuming the tenant qualifies, HUD subsidizes the\ntenant by paying a fixed portion of the rent. Thus, no new construction is required and no cooperation\n[29]\nagreements need be obtained.  However, although there is no need for cooperation agreements, willing\nlandlords, third-parties not before the court, must be located and their consent given to the project. What has\nbeen set out before as to public housing projects generally therefore applies to Section 8 Existing Housing in this\nregard. City of Hartford v. Glastonbury, 561 F.2d 1032 (2d Cir.1976) (en banc), cert. denied,434 U.S. 1034, 98\nS.Ct. 766, 54 L.Ed.2d 781 (1978). There is also no indication here of specific projects or sites available under\n[30]\nSection 8, outside the City of Toledo, which were refused or rejected by any named defendants.\nIn spite of this, we find ourselves unable to rule conclusively that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Section\n8 Existing Housing program. Plaintiffs challenge directly the actions of HUD in setting rentals too low to foster\nadequate housing outside Toledo. To the extent that this may require relief directed solely against HUD or LMHA,\n[31]\nstanding may exist. See, e.g., Davis v. Mansfield Metropolitan Housing Authority, 751 F.2d 180 (6th Cir.1984).\nWe hold only that insofar as plaintiffs attempt in some way to force Section 8 Existing Housing upon third parties\nnot before this court, there is no standing.\nWe conclude that no plaintiff has established standing with respect to constitutional claims under the fifth,\nthirteenth and fourteenth amendments, nor with respect to statutory claims under the Civil Rights Act, Title VI,\nTitle VIII, and the Housing Act, as far as those allegations relate to plaintiffs' expressed desire to move to, or live\nin, a particular suburb of Toledo. Plaintiffs have each failed to demonstrate a personal, particularized injury\ninflicted by these particular defendants in respect to these claims. They have each failed to establish a\nsubstantial probability that but for defendants' alleged constitutional and/or statutory infractions (or actual failures\nand omissions to act to bring about the kind of affirmative relief sought) they would have been able to obtain low-\nrent public housing with defendants' assistance in the areas specified outside Toledo. To put it another way, even\nif LMHA and/or HUD were ordered to seek to obtain cooperation agreements from municipalities surrounding\nToledo, the relief requested, there is no substantial probability that plaintiffs would be successful in obtaining\nhousing in those municipalities. We therefore dismiss these claims for lack of standing.\n1101\n\n*1101 On the contrary, as to the constitutional and statutory claims against defendants for allegedly bringing\nabout segregation of the existing LMHA public housing projects in Toledo and nearby Toledo in Lucas County,\nplaintiffs have standing to pursue these claims. See Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d\n792; Harris, 607 F.2d 514.\nIn sum, plaintiffs lack standing on all claims against defendants except that claim that \"[d]efendants violated\nplaintiffs constitutional and statutory rights by their policies and practices which caused and perpetuated the\ninternal racial segregation of LMHA housing projects and their location ... in areas of racial concentration.\" Also,\nthe claim under the Section 8 Existing Housing program, to the extent it does not involve third parties not before\nthe court, should not be dismissed for lack of standing.\nB. HOLDING OF THE TRIAL COURT\nThe trial court found that \"intentional racial discrimination over a long period of time ... has played ... a significant\nrole in the concentration of minority persons in limited sections of Toledo and Lucas County ... [and] that positive\n[32]\nsteps must be taken to alter existing patterns of racial segregation.\"  It was this background finding that\ninfluenced the court's discussion about the allegedly segregated housing projects operated by defendants as a\nconsequence of what he called \"a device known as `freedom of choice.'\" The trial court described the three\n[33]\nrefusal policy of LMHA, which offers a prospective tenant at the top of the waiting list  a choice as to whether\nor not to accept the next \"available unit\" of public housing, as \"racism,\" since \"freedom of choice\" was a\n\"euphanism\" for \"racism.\"\nThe trial court found that defendants placed housing projects for the elderly in \"substantially all white census\ntracts\" in order to maintain discrimination, and that \"HUD did not set rents high enough to obtain property in non-\nminority tracts\" with respect to leased housing developments. It is difficult to follow the court's discussion of\ndiscrimination against the \"poor,\" yet the court faults HUD and holds it responsible, together with LMHA, for not\nsetting higher Section 8 Existing Housing rental rates for which plaintiffs may not even qualify. The court held that\n[34]\ndefendants discriminated against the poor  because\nIf all are to be treated equally, the plaintiffs are entitled to do what the majority does 00 move to the\n97\nsuburbs.\nThe district court held further that defendants' \"failure to do what the law requires is tantamount to willful\ndiscrimination.\" The court found defendants' failure to disturb the status quo over a long period of years deprived\nthe members of the plaintiff class of their rights under the Constitution and laws to \"safe, sanitary and decent\nhousing.\" But, as previously noted, the Constitution does not require that defendants (or others) provide any\n1102 particular quality housing, nor even \"adequate housing,\" for plaintiffs or the class whom *1102 they purport to\nrepresent. Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 92 S.Ct. 862, 31 L.Ed.2d 36. Title VIII sets out \"a policy ... to provide,\nwithin constitutional limitations, for fair housing....\" 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (emphasis added). That language has\nconsistently been interpreted as meaning a policy to bar discriminatory practices in housing, and should be read\ntogether with 42 U.S.C. § 1982. See Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 388, 89 S.Ct. 557, 559, 21 L.Ed.2d 616\n(1969); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968); Dillon v. AFBIC\nDevelopment Corp., 597 F.2d 556 (5th Cir.1979); United States v. Hunter, 459 F.2d 205, 214 (4th Cir.1972),cert.\ndenied,409 U.S. 934, 93 S.Ct. 235, 34 L.Ed.2d 189 (1972),reh'g denied,413 U.S. 923, 93 S.Ct. 3046, 37\nL.Ed.2d 1045 (1973); United States v.

Plaintiffs have no constitutional right to be furnished \"safe sanitary and decent housing\" by\ndefendants; they are constitutionally and by statute entitled to be free of any impediment or conduct on the part of\ndefendants for discriminatory reasons to deny them \"fair\" housing otherwise reasonably available to those in the\nsame position. Mahaley v. Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority, 500 F.2d 1087 (6th Cir.1974),cert. denied,\n419 U.S. 1108, 95 S.Ct. 781, 42 L.Ed.2d 805 (1975); Citizens Committee For Faraday Wood v. Lindsay, 507 F.2d\n[35]\n1065 (2d Cir.1974),cert. denied,421 U.S. 948, 95 S.Ct. 1679, 44 L.Ed.2d 102 (1975).\n\nThe district court also held that \"to discriminate against the poor, regardless of race, is abhorrent to the\nconstitutional requirement of equal protection,\" citing the dissenting opinion in James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. at\n145, 91 S.Ct. at 1335, and concluded:\nThe evidence in the case, taken as a whole, leaves no doubt that the needs of the members of the\nplaintiff class for decent, safe, and sanitary housing can only be met by developing such housing\nin the municipalities in Lucas County outside the City of Toledo, and that the defendants,\nindividually and collectively, have failed and refused to take actions that could eliminate the old\npattern of discrimination.\nThe district court, regardless of our discussion concerning the issue of standing with respect to the asserted right\nto require defendants to provide housing \"in the municipalities in Lucas County outside the City of Toledo,\" was in\nerror in concluding that defendants had violated any constitutional right of plaintiffs as low-income or poor\npersons to \"decent, safe and sanitary housing,\" as he characterized and treated their assertions in this case. He\nerred also in holding that plaintiffs as \"poor\" persons, \"regardless of race\" were entitled to equal rights with the\n\"majority\" (\"white people with money\") to move to the suburbs. Boyd v. LeFrak Organization, 509 F.2d 1110 (2d\nCir.),reh'g denied,517 F.2d 918 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,423 U.S. 896, 96 S.Ct. 197, 46 L.Ed.2d 129 (1975)\n(Supreme Court has consistently held that poverty without more is not a suspect classification); Woe v. Cuomo,\n1103 729 F.2d 96, 103 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 105 S.Ct. *1103 339, 83 L.Ed.2d 274 (1984) (\"at least\nwhere wealth is involved, the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal\nadvantages\"); San Antonio Independent School District v.

See Lindsey v. Normet; James v. Valtierra; Acevedo, 500 F.2d at\n1082 (\"Fair Housing Act does not impose any duty upon a governmental body to plan for, approve and promote\nany housing\"); Lindsay, 507 F.2d at 1068 (\"while race has long been recognized as a suspect classification low-\nincome status has not been so recognized\"); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. at 443, 88 S.Ct. at 2205\n(Congress may assure \"that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands\nof a White man ... the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy ... in respect to acquisition of housing and\nproperty without discrimination\"); Ybarra, 503 F.2d at 253 (\"we agree that discrimination against the poor does\nnot become discrimination against a minority because there is a statistical correlation between poverty and ethnic\nbackground\").\nThe policy underlying the Housing Act is to enable the federal government \"to assist the States and their political\nsubdivisions ... by improving housing conditions.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1437; see City of Cleveland v. United States, 323\nU.S. 329, 333, 65 S.Ct. 280, 282, 89 L.Ed. 274 (1945). The purpose is not to impose an obligation to place low-\nincome housing in a municipality absent its consent. See James; Ybarra. Thus, even apart from standing, to the\nextent the district court held that plaintiffs, as poor persons, had a constitutional or statutory right to live in a\nparticular location without the consent of the owner and/or the municipality involved, it was in error. We cannot,\nfurthermore, discern whether the district court came to its judgment that there was intentional racial discrimination\nbecause of a perceived \"failure to disturb the status quo,\" or because of its conclusion that discrimination against\nthe poor, including a preponderance of blacks or other minorities in that classification, was unconstitutional or\nillegal.\nHere plaintiffs contended that LMHA and HUD, and their responsible officials, did not carry out their affirmative\nobligations in a manner to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices under Title VI, Title VIII, and the\nHousing Act. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(d) and 3617. The charges are similar to those made against HUD and local\nofficials in Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530, 1532, 1533 (11th Cir.1984):\nThe plaintiffs contend that the federal defendants failed to carry out their responsibilities under\nthese sections, arguing that although they knew or should have known that public officials in north\nFulton County had a history of excluding public housing on racial grounds, HUD took no action to\n\ncounter the deliberate foot-dragging of local governments. Because of these alleged past sins of\nomission, the plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring HUD to \"take all necessary,\nappropriate and effective actions, including the provision of the first available funds and technical\nassistance, to insure the development of public housing\" in the areas in question.\n* * * * * *\nAs we have seen, plaintiffs essentially allege that the federal defendants did not do what they\nostensibly ought to have done under sections 3608(a)(3) and (5). Specifically, the plaintiffs\ncontend that HUD should have pressured the County Commission into supplying the commitment\nletter for the Hopewell Road site in a reasonable time, or alternatively should have either waived\n1104 its commitment letter *1104 requirement or authorized the Housing Authority to take legal action to\nobtain the commitment letter. The plaintiffs also suggest that HUD should have allowed the\nHousing Authority to exercise condemnation powers to secure the necessary sites, and they\ndenounce HUD for agreeing to the Housing Authority's subsequent amendment changing the\nnature of the proposal to a mix of family units and housing for the elderly.\nThese contentions made by plaintiffs in Alpharetta, similar to those asserted in this case, were held not to be\nwithin the scope of the Housing Act:\nThis is a potentially sweeping reinterpretation of the nature of the affirmative duty imposed upon\nHUD by the Fair Housing Act, and we conclude that it has no support either in the terms of the\nstatute, the statutory history, or the applicable case law.\n* * * * * *\nThere is a vast difference, however, between requiring HUD's officials to include a particular\nconsideration in their decision-making calculus, and suggesting that a federal agency has an\naffirmative legal duty to correct injustice wherever it exists. The latter interpretation of HUD's\nmission under section 3608(d) goes far beyond the concerns that Senator Brooks expressed\nabout misguided bureaucratic decision-making, and it is unsupported by the language of the\nstatute itself. Section 3608(d)(3) simply requires HUD to supply \"technical\" assistance to other\nagencies or organizations that are concerned with the problem of fair housing, while section 3608\n(d)(5) appears to pertain only to the \"programs and activities\" which HUD itself is directly\nresponsible for administering. In addition, the statute provides HUD with few weapons to employ\nagainst wrongdoers. The Secretary is clearly empowered to \"withhold funds or defer action in the\nname of desegregation,\" 114 Cong.Record 2527-28 (1968), and Title VIII admittedly places fewer\nadministrative and statutory constraints upon his ability to revoke funding than apply under Title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1.\n737 F.2d at 1534, 1535. Alpharetta is cited to demonstrate our uncertainty about the court's holding HUD and its\nofficials liable for damages and other relief absent a direct relationship being established with respect to\ndemonstrated racially discriminatory conduct and motivation on its part, rather than its perceived inaction and/or\nrefusal to disturb the status quo.\nFurthermore, the trial court here took no account whatever of defendants' attempts within Toledo to locate public\nhousing units in non-minority areas which were frustrated after extensive court proceedings, which did not involve\n[36]\ndilatory or discriminatory conduct or unconcern on the part of defendants.  One of these cases was Skillken, a\ncase instituted by plaintiffs' attorneys in May 1974, and decided adversely to them after finally going to the\nSupreme Court in 1976. The trial court's findings and conclusions relative to racial discrimination in Skillken were\nrejected by this court.\nThis court noted in Skillken that location of low-rent public housing sites required, under a cooperation\nagreement, consent of the City of Toledo until 1968. 528 F.2d at 871; see also Davis v. City of Toledo, 54 F.R.D.\n386 (N.D.Ohio 1970) (decision of same trial judge acknowledging that location of such projects required\nsubmission of sites and plans to the Toledo planning commission). Skillken involved three public housing\n\n(turnkey) projects in which rezoning was requested for 145 public housing units. The action of the City in 1974\ndenying these applications was ultimately approved by this court despite the actions of LMHA seeking the public\nhousing involved. In that case this court observed that in 1970 twenty-one per cent of the households in Toledo\n1105 eligible for public *1105 housing were black and that fifteen per cent of the population was black or other minority,\nand that \"black families are living in virtually all parts of Toledo.\" 528 F.2d at 879.\nThe trial court in the instant case noted that slightly over fourteen per cent of Lucas County was comprised of\nblack or hispanic minority persons and found that 55 of 128 census tracts in Lucas County had more than \"22.6\npercent black residents, more than 10 percent residents of hispanic origin, or both.\" The court concluded that\nToledo was a \"racially segregated city with minority groups heavily concentrated in limited sections of the City\n...,\" using the same data upon which this court in 1975 and in 1977 relied upon in finding Toledo not to be\nsegregated. Finally, the trial court inferred from this data that \"intentional racial discrimination\" played a significant\nrole in this \"concentration of minority persons\" in Toledo and Lucas County.\nThere are also difficulties inherent in the district court's decision concerning the location of housing units in\nToledo, particularly in light of the litigation which has delayed or brought about termination of some proposed\npublic housing sites. There were seven projects located in Toledo before 1953, which were ordered to be\ndesegregated at that time pursuant to the TMHA policy adopted earlier that year. See Vann, 113 F.Supp. 210. By\nthe time of trial in this case twenty additional projects had been constructed, fourteen of which were located\noutside Black Impacted areas. (Three had been so located by 1953). Eight of the projects in areas of racial\nminority concentration, including the unit in which plaintiff Tarrie resides, were developed under Urban Renewal\n[37]\nplans to improve slum areas of the city.  This was an effort to provide sanitary and decent housing under the\nHousing Act to persons in the minority impacted area who needed this assistance by reason of living in\nsubstandard slum dwellings. The district court also ignored in its decision the location by defendants of\n[38]\napproximately one-half of Section 23 public housing program units outside Minority Concentrated areas.\nIn light of the problems noted concerning the reasoning of the district court, and in light of that court's failure to\n[39]\nconsider or discuss our contrary findings in Skillken,  we must remand the case for further consideration and\nfindings consistent with this court's discussion and determination of the issues. Also, we must consider the\ndamage awards in this case in light of our previous discussion.\nC. DAMAGE AWARDS\n[40]\nThe trial court, without any discussion of the sovereign immunity issue involving HUD and its officials,  held\nthat three plaintiffs (and presumably others in the broad class certified) could recover compensatory and punitive\ndamages, jointly and severally, against all defendants. The compensatory damages were for \"economic losses,\"\n1106 and for \"humiliation, pain and anguish,\" which the district judge \"presumed\" *1106 for the wrongful deprivations\ninvolved. Punitive damages were awarded, although it was \"difficult to find any personal malice against the\nplaintiffs or their class,\" because the defendants' conduct was \"wilful.\" We will discuss each of the plaintiffs\nawarded damages in turn.\n1. JAIMES\nThe amended complaint asserts that Jaimes now resides in Toledo, having resided for many years in Sylvania, a\nsuburb of Toledo, in inadequate housing, and that defendants' failure to provide her decent, safe and sanitary\nhousing was the basis for her claim. As before pointed out, Jaimes has no standing to assert claims for\ndefendants' failure to provide her housing in Sylvania. She may have a claim, if proven, provided she could show\nthat being kept on a waiting list for public housing by LMHA in Toledo or somewhere else in Lucas County where\npublic housing units are available violated her constitutional or statutory rights. (It is conceded that more than\none-half of the units operated by LMHA were occupied by black and other minority tenants whereas the\npopulation as a whole of the area served by LMHA consisted of less than 15 percent black or minority persons).\nThere is no basis established by the trial court for its finding that Jaimes was entitled to $7,200 compensatory\nand $14,400 punitive damages for having to wait for a place in the public housing units or other low-income\n\nhousing provided directly or indirectly by LMHA with the assistance of HUD. This award must therefore be set\naside. Whether Jaimes suffered damages for having to wait for housing assistance by reason of alleged\nintentional discriminatory actions of any defendant remains for specific determination on remand.\n2. GONZALES\nLike Jaimes, Gonzales desires to be afforded low income or public housing in Sylvania, and is on the LMHA\nwaiting list for assistance. What has been said in the case of Jaimes applies also to Gonzales, who received a\nsimilar damage award. In their brief, Jaimes and Gonzales base their awards for damages upon \"defendants'\nracially discriminatory site selection actions.\" A claim may be sustained only if the alleged site selection actions of\ndefendants, in view of the standing rationale herein set out, can be shown to have been intentionally\ndiscriminatory and directly related to the deprivation of either constitutional or statutory entitlements. Jaimes and\nGonzales may claim damages only if defendants' illegal actions directly and proximately denied them public or\nlow-income housing available following their applications for it.\n3. TARRIE\nTarrie complained about residing in a \"predominantly black LMHA public housing development ... in a racially\nconcentrated area of Toledo.\" She argues that defendants would \"not permit her to transfer to a unit in an\nunimpacted area.\" The trial court found that she requested transfers \"to a larger apartment [larger than the three\nbedroom unit she and her family have occupied] outside the impacted area.\" There is no analysis by the court\nconcerning the $18,000 award rendered to Tarrie as to whether her ADC monthly income of $409 since 1975\nwould support a move to a larger apartment or whether such an apartment was available to her in another area\nbeside the one in which she lived; or whether the so-called \"three refusal\" policy condemned by the district court\nwas a proximate cause of any damage allegedly suffered by Tarrie. There is also no discussion as to whether a\ntransfer policy based on seniority, if one had been adopted, would have entitled Tarrie to effect a transfer to\n[41]\nanother desired location for which she was eligible and could afford.  She was evidently found ineligible for a\n1107 transfer on the basis of health or *1107 economic reasons. The award to Tarrie, under the circumstances, must\nbe set aside and the matter remanded for the opportunity to develop relevant findings in respect to Tarrie's claim\nand proximate damages suffered, if any, by reason of any defendant's intentional illegal or unconstitutional\nactions. There was an indication by the trial court of economic losses suffered by Tarrie attributable to the actions\nof defendants. We are left to speculate as to the basis of the award to Tarrie under the circumstances, and we\ntherefore set aside the damage award against all defendants and remand this aspect of the controversy for\nfurther consideration in light of our disposition of all the issues.\nWe do note, however, that no case cited by plaintiffs, and no authority cited by the district court, supports a \ndamage award against a municipal housing authority or HUD, or their agents, for a failure to locate units in an\narea where no cooperation agreement had been obtained, and where no designated project was involved which\n[42]\nwas rejected for racial reasons by a local housing authority and/or HUD.\nD. AFFIRMATIVE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\nWe have indicated that a remand is necessary in this case with respect to the damage awards. The court's\nfinding as a basis for both damage awards and the award of other relief are in conflict with this court's findings\nand conclusions in the earlier Skillken case, and the district court made no effort to explain the basis for the\ndivergence. We, nevertheless, conclude that the injunctive relief ordered in paragraph a. of part VI of the district\n[43]\ncourt's judgment order  is appropriate, and we affirm the court to this extent; except that the term \"poverty\" is\nto be eliminated. We conclude that the relief ordered in paragraph b. of part VI of said order, however, is too\nbroad in proscribing the taking of steps to provide subsidized low-income housing \"in any area which ... soon may\nbe racially impacted.\" See supra p. 1092. There is no adequate standard upon which to judge whether a site\nselected for decent, safe and sanitary housing may \"soon be racially impacted;\" it involves a prescience and\nforeknowledge based on factors beyond the defendants' control which is inappropriate in the context of an\n\ninjunctive command. Upon remand, the trial court may, consistent with our discussion of standing, consider\nfurther whether an injunction of the nature set out in paragraph b. of part VI is appropriately limited to specific\nareas (such as census tracts, wards or other definite geographic sections) which are racially impacted.\n(Reference to the 1980 census data may be appropriate.)\nWe also find that the injunction directive set out in paragraphs c. and d. of part VI of said judgment order is too far\nreaching in light of our finding of error by the district judge in a number of respects in regard to public housing in\n1108 municipalities *1108 outside Toledo. Upon remand, the district court may, however, find it appropriate to mandate\naffirmative action by defendants in regard to using reasonable and appropriate means to seek cooperation\n[44]\nagreements from municipalities which have not previously entered into such agreements.  We reverse,\ntherefore, the injunctive provisions as presently ordered in paragraphs b., c., and d. of part VI, see supra pp.\n1091-1092, and remand these actions for further consideration and specificity in conformity with this opinion.\nThe district court found that the \"originally segregated\" housing projects of LMHA \"have remained essentially as\nthey were to begin with,\" and he concluded that \"it is inconceivable that after some twenty-five years the racial\ncomplexion of LMHA's old housing projects would not at least be the same as that of the list of housing\napplicants, if not of the community as a whole.\" We cannot tell from this language what would be deemed to be\nan acceptable measure of desegregation to the trial court. Would the 65 percent proportion of minority members\non the waiting lists be the applicable (or maximum) measure or goal for attainment, or would the 15 percent\nminority ratio of Lucas County be the applicable (or minimal) measure or goal; or would the goal for each project\nfor the elderly be the 40 percent overall ratio of minority elderly tenants or the 70 percent overall ratio of LMHA's\nfamily tenants for the family projects? We believe the district court must clarify this uncertainty in respect to the\norder that defendants prepare a \"special plan of affirmative action to reduce the racial segregation within LMHA\nprojects.\"\nWe find no clear error in the trial court's findings of serious racial imbalance within the LMHA projects, and that\nthis is attributable, at least in part, to past practices of segregation. Thus, those responsible for tenant assignment\nand transfers may properly be ordered to prepare such an affirmative action plan as directed by the trial court in\npart IX of his judgment order, which is affirmed, as set out:\nORDERED that defendants shall prepare and submit to this Court within sixty (60) days after the\nentry of this judgment a special plan of affirmative action to reduce the racial segregation within\nLMHA projects, which shall include, insofar as possible, but not be limited to, the abandonment of\nthe three refusal rule for new applicants, a transfer policy which encourages transfers to create\nbetter racial balance, the affirmative marketing of units to applicants where acceptance of the units\nwould create better racial balance, and the earlier housing of applicants of LMHA's waiting list if\nthey are willing to reside in a project which would have a better racial balance if they resided in\nit....\nWith respect to part VII of the trial court's order, we set this dispersal direction of subsidized low-income housing\naside in light of the conclusions which we have previously reached that the trial court must take into account,\nbefore ordering any defendant to locate subsidized housing \"throughout the territorial jurisdiction of LMHA,\" the\nconsent of the particular municipality, governmental unit and/or private ownership involved, and the feasibility of\nsuch location in light of available financing, zoning, and other pertinent considerations.\nIV.\nIn summary, we find no clear error in the district court's findings or conclusions in relation to impermissible\ninternal segregation within LMHA housing projects. We therefore AFFIRM the order requiring prompt submission\nof a plan, encompassed within the meaning of the statutes asserted as a basis for this action, see NAACP,\nBoston Chapter v. Harris, 607 F.2d 514; Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority, 503 F.2d 930, to correct that\n1109 situation, *1109 as set out in part IX and, in substance, paragraph a. of part VI of the trial court's order.\n\nWe find no standing in respect to the claims for location of desired public or low-income housing in municipalities,\nnot parties before the court, in the absence of particular sites where there has been alleged or demonstrated\nrejection of low-income subsidized housing or public housing projects for racial or discriminatory reasons.\nWe set aside the damage awards and the court's injunction and direction for submission of affirmative action\nplans, except for part IX and paragraph a. of part VI of the trial court's judgment order, and REMAND the cause\nfor further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nEach party will bear its or his own costs on this appeal. This direction as to costs, however, is not intended to\npreclude full and fair consideration by the district court of plaintiffs' petition for allowance of attorneys' fees with\nrespect to hearings before the district court and in respect to this appeal.\n[*] Honorable Julia S. Gibbons, United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] Toledo, Sylvania, Maumee, and Oregon.\n[2] Ottawa Hills, Holland, Whitehouse, Waterville, Berkey and Harbor View.\n[3] We take judicial notice that the 1980 census did depict some change in this statistical data. In 1980, of the\n471,741 inhabitants of Lucas County, approximately 84 percent were white, 14 percent were black, and 3 percent\nwere Mexican-American or other.\n[4] We take note, again, that this has not varied materially in the 1980 census report. In 1980, approximately 97\npercent of the blacks and 84 percent of the Mexican-Americans lived in the city.\n[5] In 1980 this figure was closer to 75 percent.\n[6] A census tract is \"Black Impacted\" if its percentage of blacks exceeds twice the percentage of blacks living in\nthe county. At the same time, a census tract is \"Minority Concentrated\" if it is either Black Impacted or has three\ntimes the percentage of hispanics living in the county.\n[7] This de jure segregation was ordered to cease in Vann v. Toledo Metro Housing Authority, 113 F.Supp. 210\n(N.D.Ohio 1953), after initial steps had been taken to this effect.\n[8] \"Out of racial balance\" for family units means that instead of there being a 70 percent minority to 30 percent\nwhite ratio, minority representation is over 85 percent or under 55 percent in any given project. For elderly units,\nthis means instead of a 40 percent minority to 60 percent white ratio, minority representation is either over 55\npercent or under 25 percent.\n[9] At one time Section 23 Leased Housing was available. This was abandoned in 1974, with much of this type\nbeing converted into Section 8 Housing.\n[10] Under the \"three refusal program,\" employed by LMHA, if an applicant does not wish to live in the unit\noffered, he may reject it and wait for the next available unit. It is only after the third refusal that an applicant is\nthen removed from the top of the waiting list and placed at the bottom.\n[11] The agreement is required by statute and must provide the property with tax exempt status and allow for\nproper services. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437d; 24 C.F.R. § 841.201(c).\n[12] In 1973, HUD's Equal Opportunity Division suggested that a moratorium be placed on further construction in\nToledo until LMHA demonstrated \"`sufficient, comparable opportunities' for public housing applicants, including\nminority applicants, outside the Corridor [i.e., the minority area where most of the projects existed].\" The\nsuggested moratorium was not carried into effect.\n[13] Plaintiffs also argue that Section 23 Leased Housing and Section 8 Existing Housing are subject to\nsegregation and discrimination. In 1977, there were approximately 550 units leased to LMHA. None of these\n\nwere located in the suburbs, while 53 percent were located in Minority Concentrated areas. About two-thirds of\nthe family units were located in these areas. \nOf the 322 units occupied through Section 8 Housing, 52.8 percent were located in Minority Concentrated areas,\nwhile only somewhere between 3 to 15 units were found in the suburbs.\n[14] HUD not only claims the court erred in awarding damages, but also claims to be protected by sovereign\nimmunity.\n[15] The issue was raised in the district court, where the court found in favor of standing. 432 F.Supp. 25\n(N.D.Ohio 1977). Also, HUD raised the issue orally before this court, though not addressing the issue in its brief.\n[16] The Supreme Court has expressly rejected any notion that these last two elements of the standing analysis\nare one and the same. \nThe \"fairly traceable\" and \"redressability\" components of the constitutional standing inquiry were initially\narticulated by this Court as \"two facets of a single causation requirement.\" To the extent there is a difference, it is\nthat the former examines the causal connection between the assertedly unlawful conduct and the alleged injury,\nwhereas the latter examines the causal connection between the alleged injury and the judicial relief requested.\nCases ... in which the relief requested goes well beyond the violation of law alleged, illustrate why it is important\nto keep the inquiries separate if the \"redressability\" component is to focus on the requested relief.\nAllen v. Wright, 104 S.Ct. at 3326 n. 19 (citation omitted).\n[17] Prudential considerations also are applied to limit standing. For example, a party may be barred from\nasserting the rights of others, see Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 97 L.Ed. 1586 (1953), or\nmay be prevented from prosecuting a \"general grievance\" common to a large group of people. See Valley Forge,\n454 U.S. at 474-75, 102 S.Ct. at 759-60. Also, as a prudential requirement, a party may be required to fall within\nthe \"zone of interests\" intended to be protected by a given statute. See Association of Data Processing Service\nOrganizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970).\n[18] In comparing the present case with Warth and County of DuPage, we exclude at this juncture of our\ndiscussion the claim of racial segregation within existing LMHA units.\n[19] The former case involved Penfield, New York, a suburb of Rochester; the latter a county area outside\nmetropolitan Chicago.\n[20] The Rochester Homebuilders Association, Inc., another plaintiff (in a similar position with the plaintiff in \nCounty of DuPage), claimed \"that the town's zoning practices have deprived its members of the opportunity to\nconstruct housing for low and middle income persons, thus harming the association's members....\" Warth v.\nSeldin, 495 F.2d 1187, 1190 (2d Cir.1974). Other plaintiffs asserted that several proposals for low income\nhousing had been rejected by defendants. Low income black and Puerto Rican plaintiffs who resided in\nRochester claimed to have \"sought but failed to obtain housing in Penfield,\" but without specifying a particular\nrejection. 495 F.2d at 1191.\n[21] The district court found statistical disparities between the black population in unincorporated areas and in the\nentire county, and that the practices challenged were more pervasive than in Warth.\n[22] Plaintiffs assert that they wish to have the \"opportunity\" to live outside the City of Toledo. The absence of\nsuch an \"opportunity,\" however, is not an injury within the constitutional meaning of that word. Such an \"injury\" is\nobviously shared by a large class of people, extending well beyond the class certified in this case. \"For purposes\nof standing, ... it is the exclusion itself that is of critical importance, since exclusion alone would violate the\nasserted rights quite apart from any objective or subjective disadvantage that may flow from it.\" Warth, 422 U.S.\nat 503 n. 13, 95 S.Ct. at 2207 n. 13. Therefore, it is not a general absence of opportunity that injures plaintiffs,\nrather it is the particular exclusion that must form the focus of our analysis. This distinction, for purposes of\nstanding, is important. Exclusion creates a more direct injury than a mere absence of opportunity to relocate\nsomewhere else. Only the former is judicially cognizable as an injury for purposes of standing.\n\n[23] At the hearing, the district judge noted that defendants, at the urging of HUD, had by letter (ineptly in his\nview) attempted to obtain such approval, but without success.\n[24] Plaintiffs Jaimes and Gonzales were living in Toledo at the time of the hearing, but had lived for many years\nin Sylvania and desired to have affordable public housing there. Plaintiff Turner was living in Toledo at the time of\nthe hearing also, but desired affordable public housing in Maumee.\n[25] Appellees do point out in their brief that in 1978 three sites were selected in non-Minority Concentrated areas\nfor proposed construction of public housing. These were subsequently abandoned by LMHA, and are currently\nthe subject of litigation. Arthur v. City of Toledo, No. 78-153 (N.D.Ohio 1978). These units, however, were all to be\nbuilt in the City of Toledo and not in the suburbs.\n[26] Municipalities must make important decisions regarding cooperation agreements. See supra note 11.\n\"[U]nder federal law, a cooperation agreement requires a governing body to provide services and to waive taxes\non the project.\" United States v. Board of School Commissioners of Indianapolis, 637 F.2d 1101, 1126 (7th Cir.)\n(Tone, J., dissenting), cert. denied,449 U.S. 838, 101 S.Ct. 114, 66 L.Ed.2d 45 (1980); see also James v.\nValtierra, 402 U.S. at 143 n. 4, 91 S.Ct. at 1334 n. 4; Housing Authority of Seattle, 629 F.2d at 1309.\n[27] Judge Tone, however, dissented with respect to consideration of \"inter-district\" relief.\n[28]See Dailey v. City of Lawton, 296 F.Supp. 266 (W.D.Okla.1969),aff'd,425 F.2d 1037 (10th Cir.1970); Park\nView Heights Corp. v. City of Black Jack, 467 F.2d 1208 (8th Cir.1972); Shannon v. United States Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, 436 F.2d 809 (3d Cir.1970); Kennedy Park Homes Association v. City of\nLackawanna, 318 F.Supp. 669 (W.D.N.Y.), aff'd,436 F.2d 108 (2d Cir.1970),cert. denied,401 U.S. 1010, 91\nS.Ct. 1256, 28 L.Ed.2d 546 (1971).\n[29] Cooperation agreements are not required for Section 8 New Construction Housing where there are eligible\nand interested developers who seek such projects. See generally 24 C.F.R. Part 880. Because LMHA has not\nimplemented this program and because plaintiffs do not challenge LMHA's decision in this regard, we find it\nunnecessary to address the significance, if any, of this circumstance. Suffice it to say that even assuming that no\ncooperation agreements are required, several other contingencies might preclude construction.\n[30] Plaintiffs concede that Section 8 prospective tenants \"were told to report incidents of discrimination to HUD\nor LMHA,\" and that there were few, if any, such complaints. Plaintiffs also concede that LMHA sought willing\nSection 8 landlords, as could prospective tenants on their own, and that positive results were dependent not only\non the willingness of private market landlords, but also on the intensity of the prospective tenant's efforts.\n[31] From the record before us we find difficulty in determining whether any of the named plaintiffs attempted to\nengage in, or would qualify for, the Section 8 Existing Housing program. The absence of such an attempt may\ncause further difficulties in regard to standing. See Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31\nL.Ed.2d 636 (1972). Because we find it necessary to remand this case to the district court, we find it unnecessary\nto discuss further standing in regard to Section 8 Existing Housing. We note only that the relief sought by\nplaintiffs on remand may affect their standing, as might the absence of attempted participation in the program.\n[32] This conclusion is in conflict with the finding of this court in Joseph Skillken and Co. v. City of Toledo, 528\nF.2d 867 (6th Cir.1975),vacated and remanded,429 U.S. 1068, 97 S.Ct. 800, 50 L.Ed.2d 786,upon remand, 558\nF.2d 350 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 985, 98 S.Ct. 611, 54 L.Ed.2d 479 (1977), reh'g denied,434 U.S. 1051,\n98 S.Ct. 904, 54 L.Ed.2d 805 (1978). See United States v. Parma, 661 F.2d 562, 574 (6th Cir.),reh'g denied,669\nF.2d 1100 (6th Cir.1981),cert. denied,456 U.S. 926, 102 S.Ct. 1972, 72 L.Ed.2d 441,reh'g denied,456 U.S.\n1012, 102 S.Ct. 2308, 73 L.Ed.2d 1309 (1982), discussed infra note 35. In Skillken, 558 F.2d at 351, this court\nadhered to its original decision, 528 F.2d 867, found it consistent with Arlington Heights and Hills v. Gautreaux,\nand held that the evidence in that case did not indicate racial segregation in Toledo. The same trial judge in the\ninstant case had held to the contrary in Skillken and was reversed. It is puzzling that this judge failed even to\nmake reference to Skillken in his memorandum decision in this case.\n[33] Plaintiffs contend that \"minority applicants make up 65% of LMHA's waiting list.\"\n\n[34] The trial court observed that \"the discrimination which this action attacks is against poor people.\" Plaintiffs\naver that they are \"low-income, minority persons.\"\n[35] We are mindful in this discussion of this court's opinion in United States v. Parma, 661 F.2d 562, a Housing\nAct and Title VIII case. Suburban Parma was found to have an unremitting racial hostility to blacks and had only\n50 blacks living in that city of over 100,000. The case involved the rejection by Parma of a specific proposal of a\nfederally subsidized multiple-family housing project. The Attorney General was found to have a specific statutory\nauthority and standing to bring the action under the Housing Act since he had \"reasonable cause to believe\" that\nracial discrimination was taking place in the official acts of that city. Parma distinguished Skillken on the grounds\nthat the latter \"was based on a finding that no racial discrimination was shown to have been involved in the City's\nrefusal to grant a rezoning request and that Toledo was not racially segregated.\" 661 F.2d at 574. The court\ndistinguished Lindsay and Acevedo v. Nassau County, New York, 500 F.2d 1078 (2d Cir.1974), also on the\ngrounds that the Attorney General of the United States had brought the suit based on an alleged general \"pattern\nand practice of discrimination.\"\n[36]See LMHA v. Boyle, No. 77-1134 (Ohio 1978); Lovell v. TMHA, No. 73-196 (N.D.Ohio 1974); Skillken.\nInterestingly, plaintiffs did not mention Skillken in their brief filed with this court, even though plaintiffs' counsel\nalso represented the plaintiffs in that case.\n[37] Altogether fourteen of the family and elderly housing projects developed by LMHA, more than half of the\ntotal, were developed under Urban Renewal programs.\n[38]See supra note 13.\n[39] This is not to say that Skillken necessarily precludes a finding of intentional discrimination in the present\ncase. We intimate only that the Skillken findings must be considered in relation to the facts presented here.\n[40] There is a substantial question as to whether the \"sue and be sued\" language of 42 U.S.C. § 1404a, as\nclaimed by plaintiffs entails a general broad waiver of sovereign immunity as to civil rights damage claims under\nthe Civil Rights Act, Title VI or Title VIII, with respect to HUD and its officials. See United States v. Adams, 634\nF.2d 1261 (10th Cir.1980); Unimex, Inc. v. United States Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, 594 F.2d\n1060 (5th Cir.1979); Penn v. Schlesinger, 490 F.2d 700 (5th Cir.1973),rev'd on other grounds,497 F.2d 970 (5th\nCir.1974) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom. Penn v. Rumsfeld, 426 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 2646, 49 L.Ed.2d 385\n(1976); Navy, Marshall & Gordon v. United States Int'l Development Coop., 557 F.Supp. 484 (D.D.C.1983).\nBecause we find it necessary to set aside the awards of damages, we decline to resolve the issue of whether\nHUD can be held liable for damages despite sovereign immunity, in light of this purported waiver.\n[41] The trial court found that \"the whole area where [Tarrie's apartment] is located is hazardous to her safety and\nthat of her family.\" If that be so, it can be readily seen that some applicants on the LMHA waiting list would be\nhesitant to move into her apartment or into the McClinton Nunn Project, and that other tenants in that project\nmight also have desired to move elsewhere. Nowhere does the court indicate that any defendant is responsible\nfor the \"hazards\" in the area, or that defendants could faisibly control those responsible for the damages there. (It\nwas built on Urban Renewal clearance land and efforts were made to place white families in this project before\nTarrie even moved into the apartment in question).\n[42] The following cases cited in the appellees' brief, Phillips v.

See supra p. 1102.\nThe order, if warranted, would be part and parcel to correcting this problem, but could not be framed so as to\nbreach the established standing principles previously discussed.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

MARTIN, Jr., Circuit Judge.\nThe Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\nchallenge a judgment requiring compliance with an affirmative action plan imposed by the court in an effort to\ndesegregate public housing in Toledo, Ohio. We conclude that certain of the plan's provisions may not\nlegitimately be enforced while others remain appropriate as narrowly-tailored remedies for past discrimination.\nThe order of the district court is, therefore, affirmed in part and reversed in part, and we order the defendants to\nundertake actions to comply with the provisions upheld. We also direct that the court hold a hearing on the issue\nof the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's liability.\nThis class action was initially brought in February 1974 by four named plaintiffs living in and around Toledo, Ohio.\nThey sought relief under the fifth, thirteenth, and fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution; the\nCivil Rights Act of 1870, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1982, and 1983; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§\n2000d 00 2000d-4; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3631; and the United States\n97\nHousing Act of 1937, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437-1437j. The plaintiffs alleged that the Lucas Metropolitan\nHousing Authority, formerly the Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, engaged in past de jure segregation, and\nthat it failed to correct the earlier illegal conduct by continuing to countenance segregation in its public housing.\nThe plaintiffs initially complained that the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority intentionally placed public\nhousing in predominantly minority areas.\nThe class was conditionally certified in April 1975, and the United States Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment was joined as a defendant. The case was tried in January 1978, and in May 1983 the district court\n\nissued its opinion. The district court found that both the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority and the United\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development were responsible for intentional discrimination and\nsegregation. The court ordered injunctive and other equitable relief, and it also ordered compensatory and\npunitive damages to three of the four named plaintiffs.\nThe defendants then appealed to this court, which issued its opinion in March 1985, reversing in part and\naffirming in part. That opinion appears at 758 F.2d 1086. We found no clear error in the district court's findings or\nconclusions regarding the impermissible internal segregation within the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority\nhousing projects, and we affirmed the order requiring prompt submission of a plan to remedy that situation. We\nfound, however, that, as to the plaintiffs' hopes for low-income housing in suburbs outside Toledo, they lacked\nstanding. The damage awards against the agency were set aside, as were the portions of the order for injunctive\nrelief dealing with the construction of projects outside the City of Toledo.\nUpon remand, a redrafted affirmative action plan was issued in December 1986, and it is before us now.\nThe plan of the district court was modeled generally along the lines of Schmidt v. Boston Housing Authority, 505\nF.Supp. 988 (D.Mass.1981), which provided in part:\nB. The general objectives of the Plan are to remedy the effects of past discrimination and to\nassure equal housing opportunity without regard to race, color, or national origin.\nIt provided that the ratio between minority and non-minority occupants in family housing locations would be\napproximately three to one, and in elderly locations one to one, and the plan allowed for a deviation of two-and-\none-half percent from these ratios. The court also provided that the plan would continue until all its objectives\nwere achieved, but that the plan could be modified upon motion of any party at any time when it appeared\nprogress was not being made toward its objectives.\nThe plan also provided, at part II, paragraph E, that each applicant would be offered the first available,\n1206 appropriately-sized *1206 unit in every Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority location in which his race did not\npredominate; if more than one unit existed, the applicant would be offered a choice. If a unit was not available in\nsuch a location, the applicant could be offered a unit in another location in which his race predominated; he could\nthen refuse that unit without losing his place in line. Part II, paragraph F, provided that, if the applicant refused all\nunits offered in which his race did not predominate, absent good cause, the applicant would lose his place and\nmove back to the end of the waiting list. \"Good cause\" would occur when either: (1) physical needs of the\noccupant required, or (2) the location would cause undue hardship with respect to health or employment.\nPart III provided for transfers and established priorities for available units. The priorities were as follows:\n1. hardship transferees (those with a compelling medical or employment need);\n2. integrative transferees;\n3. new applicants whose assignment will decrease the segregation of the location; and\n4. new applicants whose assignment will not change or increase the segregation of the location.\nParagraph E provided that the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority and the United States Department of\nHousing and Urban Development would pay either the actual moving expenses at a rate not to exceed $200 per\nbedroom or would provide free moving services for integrative transferees. In addition, the transferee would not\nbe charged any rent for the first month after transfer. Part IV, paragraph B, of the plan also incorporated\nprovisions for intensive counselling for tenants in the projects who were undergoing integration. Part IV,\nparagraph C, required the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to increase the Lucas\nMetropolitan Housing Authority's annual operating funds to enable the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority to\nhire an additional four maintenance personnel who would recondition vacant units to make them available more\nquickly. Paragraph D required the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to increase the\nLucas Metropolitan Housing Authority's operating funds to enable the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority to\nhire an additional four employees for purposes of coordinating and implementing the new application, transfer,\nand notice procedures. Paragraph E provided that the funds for paragraphs C and D would be in addition to the\n\nLucas Metropolitan Housing Authority's normal allocation from the United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development rather than being drawn from the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority's existing budget.\nThe remainder of the plan involved notice and monitoring provisions.\nThe defendants have only volunteered to change one particular aspect of the current system of housing\nassignment 00 the \"three-refusal\" rule. At present, an applicant is entitled to refuse three offered units without\n97\nhaving to show \"good cause\" before his name is placed at the bottom of the waiting list.\nWe previously found that the three-refusal rule served to maintain segregation in the housing projects, and we\nordered that it be abandoned. Our earlier opinion, however, ordered that the affirmative action plan not be limited\nto the abandonment of the three-refusal rule, but that it include: (1) a transfer policy which encourages a better\nracial balance; (2) the affirmative marketing of units to help achieve this balance; and (3) the earlier housing of\napplicants willing to reside in a project where they would improve the racial balance. The Lucas Metropolitan\nHousing Authority and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development now raise a number of\narguments in an effort to establish that the district court's proposed plan constituted an abuse of discretion.\nFirst, we acknowledge that the district court's plan would apply \"race-conscious\" criteria to those seeking\nplacement in the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority's housing. Because the plan is \"race-conscious\" as\nopposed to \"colorblind\", it must be evaluated under the two-prong \"strict scrutiny\" test. And, as the Supreme\nCourt has recognized, \"the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification\noperates against a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination.\" Wygant v.\n1207 Jackson Bd. of Educ.,*1207 476 U.S. 267, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 1846, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986) (citing Mississippi\nUniversity for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 3331, 3336 n. 9, 73 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1982); \nRegents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 291-99, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2748-53, 57 L.Ed.2d 750\n(1978) (opinion of POWELL, J., joined by WHITE, J.)). The race-consciousness of the plan involved here,\nhowever, does not involve so-called reverse discrimination. Rather, this plan is facially neutral; it neither prefers\nblacks over whites nor whites over blacks. Instead, the district court's plan prefers those tenants and would-be\ntenants of the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority who are willing to aid in the integration of the public housing\nfacilities. Both minorities and non-minorities are eligible for preferential treatment under the plan, and those with\nhardship needs are preferred over integrative transferees and applicants.\nThis does not mean that we need not apply strict scrutiny. That test requires, first, that any racial classification \"be\njustified by a compelling governmental interest.\" Second, the means chosen must be \"narrowly tailored to the\nachievement of that goal.\" Wygant, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 1846 (citing Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432, 104 S.Ct.\n1879, 1881, 80 L.Ed.2d 421 (1984); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 480, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 2776, 65 L.Ed.2d\n902 (1980)).\nHere, we must assume the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority was guilty of past discrimination and of acts\nperpetuating segregation within the housing units. Remedying the manifestations of past discrimination has long\nbeen recognized as a compelling governmental interest. In such cases it may be necessary to take race into\naccount in fashioning a remedy. Wygant, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 1850. Because Wygant involved layoffs of tenured\nteachers, the Court there distinguished earlier cases involving minimal burdens on innocent parties. Id. at\n1850-51. We believe the remedy ordered in this case, with certain changes, imposes a minimal burden on the\nparties involved and is, therefore, narrowly tailored to achieve its purposes. We do not believe that the plan will\nburden either minorities or non-minorities. To the extent that the plan's three-to-one ratio may serve to prefer\neither whites or blacks in obtaining public housing, we hold that it is void. Nonetheless, we find that the concept of\nidentifying a ratio representing the racial mix of both those currently residing in the Lucas Metropolitan Housing\nAuthority's housing and those on the waiting list is both permissible and desirable as a goal for integration. But it\nshould not be interpreted as a strict racial quota. As the district court stated, as long as the racial mix within\nindividual housing projects is moving toward the desired balance, the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority and\nthe United States Department of Housing and Urban Development will be in compliance with the plan.\nHere we would like to draw from an order by Judge Odell Horton, Jr. of the Western District of Tennessee\napproving a settlement in a similar case. In that order, which was filed with the record below, Judge Horton\nordered an annual review of the racial composition of all the housing projects, as well as a review of the family\n\ncomposition within the projects, in order to determine which families were in units of inappropriate size and which\nprojects were ripe for further integrative transfers. We believe the same kind of review should occur here.\nIn addition, Judge Horton ordered that the Memphis plan should be in effect for six years. Here, Judge Young has\nordered that the plan be in effect for perpetuity. We believe that, in so doing, Judge Young intends that\ndiscrimination may never again be allowed to exist. The plan itself, however, should not need to exist in\nperpetuity. We suggest to the district court that the plan should end upon the court's finding that its goal has been\naccomplished or upon a motion of either party followed by a hearing on the issue.\nThus, as required by Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276,\n28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971), and Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 744, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3127, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974),\nthe scope of the remedy here is consistent with the nature and extent of the constitutional violation. For, \"[o]nce a\nright and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is\n1208 broad, ... breadth and flexibility are inherent *1208 in equitable remedies.\" Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 297,\n96 S.Ct. 1538, 1546, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976) (quoting Swann, 402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276). We are faced\nhere with a past history of de jure segregation, which, despite the district court's order in Vann v. Toledo, 113\nF.Supp. 210 (N.D.Ohio 1953), the defendants have failed to take affirmative steps to remedy. These\ncircumstances indicate that the imposition of racial goals is proper and necessary. The problems have been\ncompounded by the inaction of the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority following the decisions of both the\ndistrict court and the Sixth Circuit Court. Such inaction, combined with the lack of teeth in the Lucas Metropolitan\nHousing Authority's proposed remedial plan, mandates the prompt imposition of this new plan.\nThe more difficult issues in this case involves the liability of the United States Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment and the scope of the remedy that may be ordered against it. It is argued that the well-established\n\"law-of-the-case\" doctrine prevents our review of the issue of the United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development's liability.\nThis argument would prevail if we and the district court had in fact made a specific determination during the\nearlier appeal. A reading of our opinion reveals, however, that we were uncertain about \"holding HUD and its\nofficials liable absent a direct relationship being established with respect to demonstrated racially discriminatory\nconduct and motivation on its part, rather than its perceived inaction and/or refusal to disturb the status quo.\" \nJaimes, 758 F.2d 1086, 1104. We then remanded the case, asking the district court to address the liability issue.\nOn remand, the district court failed to do so. Instead, it merely upheld those parts of the plan not expressly struck\ndown by our opinion.\nAlthough we do not feel it is our role to resolve this issue, we feel the district court should be guided by the\nEleventh Circuit's opinion in Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530, 1537 (11th Cir.1984). In Anderson,\nthe court interpreted section 3608(d)(5) of Title 42 and decisions which subjected the United States Department\nof Housing and Urban Development to liability in two types of situations: first, when the United States Department\nof Housing and Urban Development has taken discriminatory action itself; and second, when the United States\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development is aware of a grantee's discriminatory practices but has made\nno effort to force it to comply with the Fair Housing Act by cutting off existing federal financial assistance.\nIn our opinion in Jaimes, 758 F.2d 1086, 1104, we expressed uncertainty as to whether the United States\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's relationship with the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority was\nclose enough to constitute awareness of discriminatory practices. Additionally, we found that the Lucas\nMetropolitan Housing Authority had no duty to seek cooperation agreements with municipalities in order to\nconstruct low-income housing outside Toledo. Therefore, we cannot now hold the United States Department of\nHousing and Urban Development liable for any role it may have played in the failure to seek such cooperation.\nThus, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development may only be found liable if the\ninformation with which the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority provided it, information regarding the Lucas\nMetropolitan Housing Authority's practices and the racial mix of projects, put the United States Department of\nHousing and Urban Development on notice of discriminatory conduct on the part of the Lucas Metropolitan\nHousing Authority. This issue, of course, is a factual question which must be resolved by the district court.\n\nIf, in fact, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is found liable, the question remains\nfor what is it liable in light of sovereign immunity? In Selden Apartments v. U.S. Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev.,\n785 F.2d 152 (6th Cir.1986), we attempted to determine to what extent the \"sue and be sued\" provision of 42\nU.S.C. § 1404a waives the sovereign immunity of the United States Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment. The statute states it \"may sue and be sued only with respect to its functions under this chapter,\nand sections 1501 to 1505 of this title.\" Thus, to the extent that the United States Department of Housing and\n1209 Urban *1209 Development is being sued under the Housing Act of 1948 of the National Housing Act of 1934, it\nhas waived sovereign immunity. In addition, civil rights actions against the United States Department of Housing\nand Urban Development seeking declaratory or injunctive relief have been allowed, without considering the\nquestion of sovereign immunity, because those plaintiffs rely on the Administrative Procedure Act as applied\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2. Selden Apartments, 785 F.2d 152, 157. Thus, only where the civil rights actions seek\nmonetary damages does the problem actually arise.\nThe final issue is whether the other provisions of the affirmative action plan are permissible. Those provisions\ninclude the order that the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development provide funding for the\nLucas Metropolitan Housing Authority to hire eight additional staff people and that the Lucas Metropolitan\nHousing Authority provide moving services or pay $200 per bedroom for integrative transferees. These provisions\nare not in the nature of damages, and they could be paid out of funds in control of the United States Department\nof Housing and Urban Development as distinguished from general treasury funds. See id. at 157. Nonetheless,\nwe are not convinced that we should order disbursement of these funds to the Lucas Metropolitan Housing\nAuthority without a further finding by the district court. Therefore, we hold that Part IV, paragraphs C, D, and part\nof E are not enforceable. In Part IV, paragraph E, however, the provision that Lucas Metropolitan Housing\nAuthority provide a month's free rent to integrative transferees remains effective as being totally within the control\nof the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority.\nTherefore, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand this case to the district court for a specific finding on the\nextent of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's liability.\nWELLFORD, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part and concurring in part:\nIn Selden Apartments v. U.S. Dept. of Housing & Urban Development, 785 F.2d 152, 158 (6th Cir.1986), we\nmade it clear that a civil rights action seeking damages does not lie against HUD, \"based on the limitations Burr\n[1]\n placed on the waiver of HUD's sovereign immunity.\" The record in this case establishes that any \"award\" or\njudgment imposing affirmative relief in requiring an expenditure of funds against HUD is in effect an imposition of\ndamages against that agency of the United States and is barred by the rationale of Selden.\nIn addition, our prior opinion in this case expressed our view that there was no persuasive finding of a direct\nrelationship between the racially discriminatory conduct of LMHA and its officials, and the actions of HUD or its\nofficials. In our previous treatment of this case, we directed the district court to make a finding concerning HUD's\nwaiver of sovereign immunity because we felt there was an insufficient link between the action of LMHA and its\n[2]\nofficials, and HUD. Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Auth., 758 F.2d 1086 (6th Cir.1985). This was not\ndone, and I do not believe plaintiffs are entitled to yet another remand to establish such a liability claim.\nThis is not to say that HUD cannot be liable under certain limited circumstances. Plaintiff is entitled to make HUD\na defendant for the purposes of receiving declaratory or injunctive relief, such as assisting LMHA to change its\npolicies towards desegregating housing units. HUD and its officials do not, however, have \"an affirmative legal\nduty to correct injustice wherever it exists,\" but rather to \"supply `technical' assistance to ... organizations that are\nconcerned with the problem of fair housing,\" or to \"`withhold funds or defer action in the name of desegregation.'\" \nJaimes, 758 F.2d at 1104 (quoting Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530 (11th Cir.1984)) (emphasis\nadded).\n1210 *1210 I would also limit the affirmative action order in this case to the type and extent of relief such as specified\nby Chief Judge Horton in Hale v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, No. C-73-410 (W.D.Tenn.\nAugust 23, 1985) [Available on WESTLAW, DCT database]. Particularly, I would limit its reach and effectiveness\n\nto six years as in that case because an \"open ended\" or indefinite term order of the type ordered by the district\ncourt here is inappropriate.\nTherefore, I concur that prompt implementation of a limited and \"narrowly tailored\" affirmative action plan to\nassist in bringing about desegregation is permissible with primary liability directed against LMHA and its officials. I\nconcur in the holding that HUD may not be liable for LMHA's failure to construct low-income housing in\nmunicipalities outside Toledo. I dissent from the decision to remand for consideration of the liability of HUD to\nprovide funding for additional LMHA staff people or for transfer expenses.\nON REHEARING\nWELLFORD, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nI would grant HUD's motion for clarification or modification or rehearing in this case, which has now been heard\ntwice by two different panels of this court. I believe that this court should clearly specify what provisions of the\norder of the district court are \"void,\" and/or which provisions set out unlawful or improper racial preferences in\ntenant assignments. It should set out what \"changes\" in the plan imposed by order of the district court would\nproduce only a \"minimal burden on the parties.\" Maj. op. at 1207.\nI reiterate my position, as the author of the prior opinion and the dissent in this case, that the doctrine of\nsovereign immunity protects HUD from an award of damages or providing funding to Lucas Metropolitan Housing\nAuthority. See Selden Apartments v. United States Dep't of Housing and Urban Development, 785 F.2d 152 (6th\nCir.1986); Massachusetts v. Departmental Grant Appeals Board, 815 F.2d 778, 783 (1st Cir.1987); Geyen v.\nMarsh, 775 F.2d 1303, 1307 (5th Cir.1985); New Mexico v. Regan, 745 F.2d 1318, 1321-23 (10th Cir.1984). At the\nvery least, the issue of sovereign immunity of HUD should be remanded for further consideration, and a particular\nholding on this question by the district court.\n[1]F.H.A. v. Burr, 309 U.S. 242, 60 S.Ct. 488, 84 L.Ed. 724 (1940). Also cited in support of that ruling were United\nStates v. Yonkers Board 594 F.Supp. 466 (S.D.N.Y.1984), and Little Earth v. HUD, 584 F.Supp. 1292\n(D.Minn.1983).\n[2] \"A waiver of sovereign immunity `cannot be implied but must be unequivocably expressed.'\" Selden at 156,\nquoting United States v.

Ohio, W.D.\nJune 6, 1989.\n836 *836 Jeanne Deimling Johns, A.B.L.E., Toledo, Ohio, for plaintiffs.\nWilliam Connelly and Kevin Joyce, Connelly, Soutar & Jackson, Toledo, Ohio, Andrea Newmark, Dept. of Justice,\nCivil Div., Anthony J. Ciccone, Jr., Trial Dept., Dept. of HUD, Washington, D.C., Charles Matuszynski, LMHA, and\nPatrick J. Foley, Asst. U.S. Atty., Toledo, Ohio, for defendants.\nOPINION AND ORDER\nMcQUADE, District Judge.\nThis case is before the court on remand from the Sixth Circuit for a specific finding on the extent, if any, of the\nUnited States Department of Housing and Urban Development's [\"HUD\"] liability. In deciding this issue, the court\nhas considered the following briefs submitted by the parties: Plaintiffs' Memorandum on the Merits Establishing\nHUD's Liability for Racial Segregation of LMHA's Public Housing Projects, Brief of LMHA Defendants Regarding\nLiability of HUD Defendants, Federal Defendants' Memorandum with Respect to HUD's Liability, Reply Brief of\nLMHA Defendants Regarding Liability of HUD Defendants, and Plaintiffs' Reply to Federal Defendants'\nMemorandum Regarding HUD's Liability. The court concludes that HUD is liable for the plaintiffs' claims in this\ncase, and that HUD is ordered to provide the relief set forth in the Memorandum and Order of December 10,\n1985.\nThis class action was filed on February 15, 1974, in the name of all low-income minority persons residing in the\nToledo metropolitan area who are unable to secure adequate housing in the Toledo metropolitan area without\nassistance from the Toledo [now Lucas] Metropolitan Housing Authority [\"LMHA\"]. The plaintiffs alleged violations\nof the fifth, thirteenth and fourteenth amendments; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1982 and 1983; Title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d002000d-4; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3631; and\n97\nthe Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437-1437j.\nIn an Opinion of May 12, 1983, by District Judge Don J. Young, the district court concluded that LMHA and HUD\nwere responsible for intentional racial discrimination that resulted in segregation of public housing in Lucas\nCounty. The court accordingly enjoined LMHA and HUD from engaging in any activities that had the purpose or\neffect of denying equal housing opportunities. The court also ordered the defendants to prepare an affirmative\naction plan to correct past segregation. Finally, the court awarded compensatory and punitive damages to three\nof the four named plaintiffs.\nIn Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, 758 F.2d 1086 (6th Cir.1985) (Jaimes I), the Sixth Circuit\naffirmed the trial court's finding that there had been impermissible internal segregation within LMHA housing\nprojects. The Sixth Circuit, however, found that the plaintiffs lacked standing on their claims that the defendants\nprevented their obtaining fair housing opportunities in the suburbs. Therefore, the Sixth Circuit reversed and set\naside that part of the order instructing the defendants to take steps to secure cooperation agreements with\n837 municipalities outside the City of Toledo in order to insure that public housing projects would be *837 constructed\nin those municipalities. The court set aside the awards of damages, and, without resolving the issue, expressed\nuncertainty about holding HUD and its officials liable for damages and other relief \"absent a direct relationship\n\nbeing established with respect to demonstrated racially discriminatory conduct and motivation on its part, rather\nthan its perceived inaction and/or refusal to disturb the status quo.\" Id. at 1104.\nA second appeal was heard by the Sixth Circuit in Jaimes v. Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority, 833 F.2d 1203\n(6th Cir. 1987) (Jaimes II), in which the court reviewed Judge Young's affirmative action plan. The Sixth Circuit\nagain affirmed Judge Young's findings and conclusions regarding intentional discrimination and segregation in\nthe housing projects. The court suggested amending the plan to provide for annual reviews of the racial\ncomposition of the housing projects and a procedure for terminating the plan. The court again declined to hold\nHUD liable without an explicit fact-based finding by the district court. The court, therefore, directed that this court\ndecide the issue of HUD's liability, and suggested that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Anderson v. City of\nAlpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530 (11th Cir.1984), serve as guidance. Finally, the Sixth Circuit affirmed those portions of\nthe affirmative action plan that are designed to remedy past discrimination, but refused to order enforcement of\nthose portions of the plan requiring additional funding from HUD.\nAs defined by the Sixth Circuit in Jaimes II, the issues before this court in determining HUD's liability are: (1)\n\"[whether] the information with which the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority provided [HUD], information\nregarding the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority's practices and the racial mix of projects, put the United\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development on notice of discriminatory conduct on the part of the\nLucas Metropolitan Housing Authority,\" Jaimes II, 833 F.2d at 1208; and, if so, (2) \"for what is [HUD] liable in light\nof sovereign immunity.\" Id.\nI. HUD FUNDING OF LMHA'S PROGRAMS\nLMHA programs funded by HUD are the primary sources of subsidized, low-income housing in Lucas County. At\nthe time of trial, LMHA owned or managed approximately 3,700 housing units through three programs: public\nhousing, Section 23 leased housing, and Section 8 existing housing. Fifty-three percent (53%) of all housing units\n[1]\nwere rented to minorities. Of that 53%, 82% of the units were located in Minority Concentrated areas.  Of the\n[2]\n605 housing units located in Black Impacted areas,  98% were occupied by minorities.\nLMHA housing units are divided into two broad categories: units for elderly persons and units for families.\nSeventy-three percent (73%) of all family units were occupied by minorities. Seventy-nine percent (79%) of the\nunits occupied by minority families were located in Minority Concentrated areas.\nA. Public Housing Program\nThrough the public housing program, HUD provides funds pursuant to the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. §\n1437-1437j, to a public housing authority through an Annual Contributions Contract. HUD provides payment of\ndebt service on the initial development costs, payment of operating subsidies, and payment of debt service on\nsubsequent capital improvements. In order to receive funding, the housing authority must obtain HUD's approval\nfor a project and submit to HUD's supervision of the housing authority's management of the project. LMHA\noperates 2,800 units under this program.\n838 At the time of trial, LMHA administered 38 housing projects. The 1977 Occupancy *838 Report[3] delivered to\nHUD from LMHA revealed that 27 of the 38 projects were significantly out of racial balance. A family unit is out of\nracial balance when minority representation in the unit is over 85% or under 55% and white representation is over\n45% or under 15%. An elderly unit is out of racial balance when minority representation is over 55% or under\n25% and white representation is over 75% or below 45%.\nIn 1953, there were seven public housing projects that were, by law, segregated according to race in Toledo. The\nhousing authority was ordered to abandon its policy of segregation and to move toward integration of all public\nhousing under its control. Vann v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, 113 F.Supp. 210 (N.D.Ohio 1953).\nBetween 1953 and 1976, six projects were constructed with HUD funds. Four of these were projects for elderly\npersons, 90% of whom were white. All four of the projects were located in white neighborhoods. Two projects\n\nwere intended for mixed elderly and family use. One was located in a Black Impacted area and 97% of its\noccupants were minorities.\nFourteen projects were constructed between 1968 and 1977, eight in Minority Concentrated areas, one in an\narea of black migration, and three in areas with a substantial number of black residents.\nThe plaintiffs argue that HUD's selection of sites for construction of housing projects from 1953 to 1978 was\ndiscriminatory, but the evidence does not support this argument. At the time of trial in 1978, HUD had funded\ntwenty-seven housing projects, fourteen of which were located outside areas of minority concentration. Eight of\nthe projects located in areas of minority concentration were \"replacement housing,\" located in areas of minority\nconcentration pursuant to urban renewal plans to improve slum areas of the city. Furthermore, two-thirds of all\npublic housing and Section 8 construction and rehabilitation projects were located outside areas of minority\nconcentration. HUD, in fact, disapproved sites located in areas of minority concentration. When such disapproval\nleft no available sites, HUD requested that LMHA, the Fair Housing Center and Advocates for Basic Legal\nEquality form a committee to locate available sites. If HUD is liable for discrimination in the public housing\nprogram, it is not because HUD's site selections were discriminatory.\nB. Section 23 Leased Housing\nAt the time of trial, approximately 550 units were leased by LMHA with HUD funds under the Section 23 leased\nhousing program. Fifty-three percent (53%) of all the Section 23 units were in areas of minority concentration;\nsixty-six (66%) percent of the Section 23 family units were in areas of minority concentration. Of all minority\ntenants living in Section 23 leased housing, 68.8% lived in Black Impacted areas and 80.8% lived in Minority\nConcentrated areas. Officials of LMHA testified at trial that one of the reasons that they were unable to obtain\nunits outside Minority Concentrated or Black Impacted areas was that rents provided by HUD were too low.\nC. Section 8 Existing Housing\nA participant in the Section 8 existing housing program receives a subsidy after obtaining living accommodations\nin the private sector, sometimes with the assistance of an LMHA referral. HUD subsidizes the difference between\nwhat a participant can afford to pay and what HUD determines to be a fair market rent for the unit.\nThe plaintiffs cite the findings of two HUD investigators who found segregation and discriminatory practices in the\nSection 8 program in Lucas County as evidence that HUD engaged in practices that had a discriminatory effect.\nThese investigations, however, were conducted in 1982 and 1984, four and six years after the trial in this case.\nThese investigations, therefore, cannot be used as a basis for showing that HUD engaged in discriminatory\npractices at the time of the trial in this case.\n839  II. ANALYSIS\n*839\nPlaintiffs' claim is that HUD violated its statutory duties not to discriminate in federally funded programs and to\nprovide fair housing. This court will initially consider whether HUD violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nor Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, because if no liability is established under those titles, then liability may\nnot attach under plaintiffs' other statutory causes of action.\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides, in part:\nNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000d.\nTitle VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 provides, in part:\n\nIt is the policy of the United States to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing\nthroughout the United States.\n. . . . .\nThe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall 00\n97\n. . . . .\n(5) administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner\naffirmatively to further the policies of this subchapter.\n42 U.S.C. §§ 3601, 3608(d)(5).\nPlaintiff's constitutional claims are based on the same evidence as their statutory claims. However, the plaintiffs\nmust show that HUD acted with a discriminatory purpose to hold HUD liable for violations of plaintiffs'\nconstitutional rights, Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-41, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047-48, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976),\nwhereas HUD may be liable for statutory violations without proof of discriminatory intent. United States v. City of\nParma, 661 F.2d 562, 575-76 (6th Cir.1981). Because this court concludes that HUD was aware of the\ndiscriminatory effect of its practices or the practices of LMHA, liability is premised on HUD's violation of Title VI\nand Title VII, and the court will not consider HUD's liability for constitutional violations.\nThe court notes at the outset that it is reviewing HUD's policies under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.\n§ 551 et seq. [\"APA\"]. The APA provides that any person \"adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action,\" 5\nU.S.C. § 702, may bring an action to \"set aside agency action ... not in accordance with law\" or to \"compel\nagency action unlawfully withheld,\" id. § 706. Review of HUD's policies is barred where \"statutes preclude judicial\nreview,\" or where \"agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\" Id. § 701(a). Neither bar, however, is\napplicable to this case: (1) there is no statutory provision precluding judicial review of HUD's policies, and (2) the\nSecretary's compliance with Title VIII is not discretionary: Title VIII states that the Secretary \"shall ... administer\nthe programs and activities ... in a manner affirmatively to further\" the fair housing policies of Title VIII. 42 U.S. C.\n§ 3608(d)(5) (emphasis added). See NAACP v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Dev., 817 F.2d 149 (1st\nCir.1987) (finding HUD's policies reviewable under the APA).\nThe scope of review is provided in 5 U.S.C. § 706:\n[T]he reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and\nstatutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.\nThe reviewing court shall 00 (1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably\n97\ndelayed; and (2) hold unlawful and set aide agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be 00\n97\n(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;\n. . . . .\n840 (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.... *840\nThus, the court will review the policies of HUD in light of the trial court's finding as affirmed by the\nSixth Circuit that unlawful intentional discrimination occurred in the administration of HUD-funded\npublic housing programs in Lucas County. Given the trial court's findings and conclusions as\naffirmed by the Sixth Circuit that intentional discrimination has resulted in the impermissible\ninternal segregation of LMHA's housing projects and the fact that HUD was aware of the racial\nimbalance of the projects and the use of the three-refusal rule, applying the Alpharetta standard of\nliability leaves HUD with no means of avoiding liability.\nAccording to Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, 737 F.2d 1530 (11th Cir.1984), HUD may be liable for failure to\ncomply with its statutory obligations under Title VIII in two situations: first, where HUD has itself engaged in\ndiscriminatory practices (such as approving funds for a project without considering its racial effect on the\n\nsurrounding area), and second, where HUD is aware of a grantee's discriminatory practices and has not made an\neffort to eliminate such practices by terminating federal financial assistance to the grantee. Id. at 1537.\nAlthough Alpharetta is not squarely on all fours with the case sub judice, its reasoning is instructive. In Alpharetta,\nthe plaintiffs alleged that HUD violated Title VIII when it failed to pressure county commissioners who deliberately\nblocked, for racially motivated reasons, attempts to construct low-income public housing in unincorporated areas\nof the county. The Eleventh Circuit emphasized that HUD has no affirmative duty to correct injustice wherever it\nexists. HUD itself has few weapons to employ against wrongdoers other than to \"`withhold funds or defer action\nin the name of desegregation.'\" Alpharetta, 737 F.2d at 1535 (quoting 114 Cong.Rec. 2527-28 (1968)). See also \nTrafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 209-11, 93 S.Ct. 364, 366-68, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972). The\ncourt rejected the argument that HUD is guilty of a violation of its statutory duty to work toward desegregation of\nhousing when it is not funding a local housing authority and it fails to act in the face of racial opposition to the\nconstruction of public housing.\nAlpharetta was a case challenging HUD's inactivity; it was not a case \"where the plaintiffs accused HUD of\nclosing its eyes to the discriminatory practices of a grantee.\" Id. at 1533. The housing authority itself was not\nnamed as a defendant in Alpharetta; the issue before the court was whether HUD was liable for its own failure to\nact. Part of the reason that the court refused to hold HUD liable on the facts of the case was the realization that\nHUD can do nothing except exert \"moral suasion\" on local officials to comply with Title VIII when HUD is not\ncurrently funding a local agency. Id. at 1535. In the case sub judice, however, HUD is accused of more than\ninactivity or refusal to disturb the status quo. The plaintiffs allege that HUD is liable for the discrimination that\noccurred in the administration of public housing in Lucas County because HUD continued to provide funds to\nLMHA while aware of the discriminatory effects of LMHA's practices and failed to force LMHA to comply with the\nlaw.\nSection 3608(d)(5) imposes an affirmative duty on the Secretary of HUD to work toward the goal of\ndesegregation in public housing projects. NAACP v. Secretary of HUD, 817 F.2d at 154-55; Alpharetta, 737 F.2d\nat 1537; Shannon v. Department of Housing & Urban Development, 436 F.2d 809, 819 (3d Cir.1970). Various\ncourts have offered their versions of the substantive content of this duty, e.g., Shannon, 436 F.2d at 819, 822; \nAlpharetta at 1537; Otero v. New York City Housing Authority, 484 F.2d 1122, 1134 (2d Cir.1973), but at a\nminimum, HUD may not expend federal funds in a manner that promotes or fails to deter discrimination in public\nhousing.\nThe evidence adduced in this case indicates that HUD was aware that some of the housing projects administered\nby LMHA were \"out of racial balance.\" This fact ought to have alerted HUD that the goal of desegregating public\n841 housing in Lucas County was not being accomplished and to continue funding LMHA projects *841 under such\ncircumstances was a violation of HUD's duty under Title VIII to promote fair housing opportunities. Because HUD\ntook no action in response to the information it received regarding the racial imbalance of LMHA's projects, HUD\nwas administering federal funds in a manner that violated its duty affirmatively to further the goal of\ndesegregation of public housing.\nHUD authorizes local housing authorities to use the \"three refusal\" policy in assigning eligible applicants to\navailable housing units. Under the \"three refusal\" policy, a single waiting list includes all eligible applicants listed\nin chronological order of application date. Preferences are given to some applicants, however, such as displaced\npersons, handicapped persons, and persons living in substandard housing. When an applicant is first on the\nwaiting list, he or she is offered a suitable unit in the project with the most vacancies at that time. The applicant\nmay refuse two offers without stating any reasons, but if the applicant refuses a third offer without cause, he or\nshe moves to last place on the waiting list. An applicant may refuse any number of units for good cause without\nsuffering any consequences.\nOn its face, the \"three refusal\" policy is race neutral. The district court found, however, that the policy maintained\nsegregation in the housing projects, and ordered that the policy be abandoned. This finding and order were\naffirmed by the Sixth Circuit. Jaimes I, 758 F.2d at 1108-09; Jaimes II, 833 F.2d at 1206. HUD asserts now that\nthere was no evidence at the time that the \"three refusal\" policy was discriminatory. HUD also posits that the\n\"three refusal\" policy was not discriminatory, but was only less effective at achieving desegregation than a \"one\nrefusal\" policy might have been.\n\nThe plaintiffs are not required to show a discriminatory intent behind the \"three refusal\" policy in order to prove a\nviolation of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. It is enough that they show that the policy had a discriminatory\neffect. See United States v. City of Parma, 661 F.2d 562, 575-76 (6th Cir.1981); Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp. v. Village of Arlington, 558 F.2d 1283, 1290-91 (7th Cir. 1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 1025,\n98 S.Ct. 752, 54 L.Ed.2d 772 (1978).\nA practice that is race neutral on its face may produce two kinds of discriminatory effects: first, it may have a\ngreater adverse effect on one racial group than another, Resident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 148-49\n(3d Cir.1977),cert. denied,435 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 1457, 55 L.Ed.2d 499 (1978), and second, it may perpetuate\nexisting patterns of segregation. Village of Arlington, 558 F.2d at 1290.\nBoth kinds of discriminatory effects were engendered by the \"three refusal\" policy. First, the trial court found, and\nthe Sixth Circuit has affirmed, that the \"three refusal\" policy has maintained segregation in LMHA's housing\nprojects. Jaimes I, 758 F.2d at 1108-09; Jaimes II, 833 F.2d at 1206. This alone is a sufficient discriminatory\neffect. Second, given that 65% of LMHA's waiting list are minority applicants and 70% of its family tenants are\nminorities, the \"three refusal\" rule also has a greater adverse effect on minorities than on whites.\nThere is some evidence, however, that several LMHA housing projects were becoming less segregated under the\n\"three refusal\" policy. Two formerly all white projects were, at the time of the trial, 58% black and 41% black. HUD\nwas also aware that LMHA was making an effort to integrate its projects by using race conscious selection\nprocedures for new projects, and the counseling of tenants.\nHUD was certainly aware the LMHA used the \"three refusal\" policy because HUD offered it to LMHA as one of\nseveral methods of assigning applicants to available units. HUD argues that awareness of the practice does not\nconstitute awareness of its discriminatory effects. HUD would have this court find liability only when HUD is\napprised by way of complaint or investigation that LMHA's practices are having a discriminatory effect or when\n842 LMHA's practices are overtly discriminatory. Cf. Clients' Council v. Pierce, 711 *842 F.2d 1406 (8th Cir.1983)\n(HUD liable for acquiescing in local housing authority practices such a dual system of processing and assigning\ntenants, overtly segregationist assignments, and refusal to name blacks to housing authority board). Because\nHUD was not aware of the discriminatory effects of the \"three refusal\" policy, so HUD argues, it should not be\nheld liable for those effects. HUD argues that \"[i]t would be unreasonable and unworkable ... to hold that HUD's\nawareness of overtly race neutral practices imposes a duty to cut off a housing authority's funding (thereby\ndenying housing to needy persons)....\" Federal Defendants' Memorandum with Respect to HUD's Liability at 23.\nThis court does not agree with HUD that it may be held liable only in instances where HUD is confronted with\nblatantly race-conscious conduct as in Clients' Council (racial steering, dual assignment system) and Gautreaux\nv. Romney, 448 F.2d 731 (7th Cir.1971) (quotas, pre-clearance procedure that included a racial veto in selecting\nhousing sites). Such a rule is patently antithetical to the standards set forth in Jaimes II and Alpharetta, which\nhold that liability may be premised on HUD's awareness of the discriminatory effects of the practices of a grantee.\nHUD is charged by Congress with the responsibility of administering public housing funds in a manner that\npromotes fair housing opportunities without discriminating on account of race. When HUD is alerted to overt\ndiscrimination, HUD agrees that it has a duty to force the local housing authority into compliance with the law. To\nconfine HUD's liability to such narrow circumstances is, however, too niggard a view of HUD's mandate: HUD's\nduty extends further to situations where it is confronted with the discriminatory effects of the local housing\nauthority's practices. Although HUD's only effective weapon to ensure compliance by the local housing authority\nmay be cutting of assistance, that is certainly not the first step HUD should take to ensure compliance. Warnings\nand investigation may be appropriate steps to take before the decision is made to cut off funds and put the\nhousing requirements of the needy into jeopardy.\nThe court in NAACP v. Secretary of HUD, 817 F.2d 149 (1st Cir.1987), rejected HUD's argument that HUD\nviolates its obligation under Title VIII only when HUD itself engages in discriminatory conduct or when HUD funds\na grantee who is engaged in such discriminatory conduct with the purpose of furthering the grantee's\ndiscrimination. Rather, the court concluded that HUD's statutory instruction \"affirmatively to further\" Title VIII's fair\n\nhousing policy required more of HUD than to refrain from discrimination itself or intentionally encouraging\ndiscrimination by others. Id. at 154-56.\nIf HUD is properly fulfilling its duties, over time one would expect to find HUD's activity increasing the supply of\nopen, integrated housing. In this case, however, one finds that segregation in housing continued and the supply\nof open, integrated housing did not increase. The plaintiffs have shown that HUD was aware of the discriminatory\neffects of practices on the part of LMHA, and HUD failed to force LMHA to comply with the law.\nHaving concluded that HUD is liable for the plaintiff's claims, the remaining issue is for what is HUD liable in light\nof sovereign immunity? In § 702 of the APA, Congress eliminated the defense of sovereign immunity in cases\nseeking relief other than money damages. Bowen v. Massachusetts, ___ U.S. ___, 108 S.Ct. 2722, 2731, 101\nL.Ed.2d 749 (1988). The Sixth Circuit held in Jaimes II that the relief ordered by the district court (that HUD\nprovide funds for LMHA to hire eight additional staff people and that HUD and LMHA either pay the actual moving\nexpenses at a rate not to exceed $200.00 per bedroom or provide free moving services for integrative\ntransferees) was not in the nature of \"damages,\" and could be paid out of funds in HUD's control rather than from\ngeneral treasury funds. Jaimes II, 833 F.2d at 1209.\nIn light of Bowen v. Massachusetts, this court is convinced that the Sixth Circuit's characterization in Jaimes II of\n843 the relief *843 HUD has been ordered to supply under the plan is correct. The Court recognized that \"[t]he fact\nthat a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a sufficient reason to characterize the\nrelief as `money damages.'\" Bowen, 108 S.Ct. at 2732. The relief ordered in this case is not compensatory relief\nintended as a substitute for a suffered loss. It is more in the nature of specific relief intended to compel\ncompliance with the law. See Maryland Dept. of Human Resources v. Dept. of Health & Human Services, 763\nF.2d 1441, 1446-47 (D.C.Cir.1985) (quoted with approval in Bowen, 108 S.Ct. at 2732-33) (arguing that an award\nof money is, in some circumstances, not an award of money damages).\nIt is therefore\nORDERED that HUD is liable for the plaintiffs' claims in this suit.\nFURTHER ORDERED that HUD is to comply with the provisions in paragraphs III.E., IV.C., and IV.D. of the\nMemorandum and Order of December 10, 1985.\n[1] A \"Minority Concentrated area\" is a census tract that is either Black Impacted (see infra note 2) or has three\ntimes the percentage of hispanics living in the county.\n[2] A \"Black Impacted area\" is a census tract that has twice the percentage of blacks living in the county.\n[3] An Occupancy Report is an annual report prepared by LMHA and sent to HUD reflecting, among other things,\nthe racial composition of housing projects operated by LMHA.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This action is brought to enjoin racially discrim-\ninatory conduct in the provision and location of low-income\n\n-2-\nhousing in the Toledo metropolitan area.  It is also brought\nto restrain interference with the right to travel and with\nthe implementation of federal programs.\n2.  This suit is instituted by low-income, minority-\npersons residing in the Toledo metropolitan area on behalf\nof themselves and all other low-income minority residents\nliving in the Toledo metropolitan area who seek the oppor-\ntunity to live in decent, safe and sanitary housing in subur-\nban areas outside areas of minority concentration.\n1*•  JURISDICTION\n3.  This Court has jurisdiction of the action pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. 1343 and 42 U.S.C. 3612 and 3617.\n4.  The plaintiffs' claims for relief are predicated  \\\nupon 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1982, 1983, 2000d, and 3601 ejt s ^,  and\nupon the Commerce Clause, the Thirteenth Amendment, and the\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\nIII.  PLAINTIFFS\n5.  Plaintiff Josie Jaimes , a Mexican-American, is a\ncitizen of the United States who resides in Toledo, Ohio.  Until\nher house was condemned in November, 1973 by the Lucas County\nHealth Department, she and her six (6) children lived in\nSylvania, a suburb of Toledo, in a two (2) room house which had\nno running water, no toilet facilities, defective wiring, and\ninadequate heat.  She had lived in the Sylvania area for approx-\nimately nineteen (19) years.  She and her family would like to\nlive in the Sylvania area for reasons of employment, schools,\nand personal ties, but they are unable to afford decent, safe,\nand sanitary housing without the assistance of the Toledo Metro-\npolitan Housing Authority  (TMHA).  When she applied for a public\nhousing unit at TMHA, plaintiff Jaimes was advised that no such\nhousing is located in the Sylvania area.  She is on the TMHA\nwaiting list.\n6.  Plaintiff Tomas Gonzales, a Mexican-American, is\n\n(\na citizen of the United States who resides with the other seven\n(7) members of his family in Sylvania in a two (2) room house\nwhich has no running water and no toilet facilities.  He has\nlived in the Sylvania area for approximately  twenty two (22)\nyears.  Plaintiff Gonzales would like to live in decent, safe,\nand sanitary housing in the Sylvania area but is unable to\nafford such housing without the assistance of TMHA.  He is on\nthe TMHA waiting list.\n7.  Plaintiff Clarence Turner, a black American, is a\ncitizen of the United States who resides with his family in a\nTMHA public housing development which is predominantly black\nand which is located in a racially concentrated area of Toledo.\nHis children attend racially segregated schools.  He has to'\ntravel to his job in Wood County, Ohio because he is unable to\nafford housing in proximity to his work.  Plaintiff Turner\nwould like to live with his family in the Maumee area but is\nunable to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing without\nthe assistance of TMHA.\n8.  Plaintiff Patricia Davis, a black American, is a\ncitizen of the United States who resides with her family in a\nTMHA public housing development which is predominantly black\nand which is located in a racially concentrated area of Toledo.\nHer children attend racially segregated schools.  She would\nlike the opportunity to live in the suburbs of Toledo but is\nunable to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing without\nthe assistance of TMHA.\nIV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n9.  This is a class action brought pursuant to Rule 23\n(a)(b)(l)(A) and (B), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure.\n10.  The class consists of all low-income residents of\nthe greater Toledo, Ohio area who by virtue of their race and\npoverty are unable to secure decent, safe, and sanitary hous-\ning at rents or prices which they can afford without the assis-\ntance of Defendant TMHA.  The class is so numerous that the\n\n-it-\njoinder of all members is impracticable.  The exact size of the\nclass is unknown, but an indication of the class size is the\nTMHA waiting list for family housing units, which presently\nconsists of approximately  one thousand eight hundred  (1,800)\nindividuals who are members of this class.  There are questions\nof law and fact common to the class.  The common question of\nlaw and fact is whether defendants' provision and location of\npublic housing in the Toledo area has denied plaintiffs and\ntheir class their rights under the Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States.  The claims of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims of the above mentioned class.  The plain-\ntiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of\ntheir class because they are members of the class and have no\nknown adverse interest to the class.  Prosecution of separate\nactions by individual members of the class would create a risk\nof (a) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to\nindividual members of the class which would establish incompat-\nible standards of conduct for the defendants, and (b) adjudi-\ncations with respect to individual members of the class which\nwould, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the interest\nof the other members not parties to the adjudication or sub-\nstantially impede their ability to protect their interests.\nThe defendants have acted or refused to act, on grounds gen-\nerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final\ninjunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole.  The\nquestions of law and fact common to the class predominate over\nany questions affecting only individual members, and a class\naction is superior to other available methods for a fair and\nefficient adjudication of the controversy.  There is no con-\nflict among the interests in individually controlling the pros-\necution and defense of separate actions.  There is no known\nlitigation presently pending concerning similar claims involv-\ning any members of the class.  This Court is a desirable forum\nin which to concentrate the litigation of the claims of the\nclass since it has the power to hear all the claims and to grant\n\n-5-\nappropriate relief.  There are not likely to be any difficulties\nin the management of a class action in notice to the members of\nthe class, since the whereabouts of all the members of the class\nis known.\nV.  DEFENDANTS\n11.  Defendant Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority\n(TMHA) is a body corporate and politic established under the\nlaws of the State of Ohio.  Ohio Revised Code  (O.R.C.) 3735.27\net seq.  It has the responsibility and authority to provide ,\nthrough construction, acquisition, and/or leasing, low-income\nhousing in all areas of Lucas County except Harding Township.\nUnder the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, 42\nU.S.C. 1401 et^ se%. , the United States Department of Housing\nand Urban Development is the principal source of financial assisV-\ntance for such housing.\n12.  Defendant Barrett is the Director of TMHA and\nas such, is charged with the administration and general super-\nvision of its housing programs.\n13.  Defendants Daig, Dennis, Dorrell, Flory, and Holland\nare members of the TMHA Board of Commissioners appointed pursu-\nant to O.R.C. 3735.27, who determine the policies of TMHAT' '.\nVI.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n14.  Lucas County is composed of the municipalities of\nToledo, Sylvania, Maumee, and Oregon, the villages of Ottawa\nHills, Holland, Whitehouse, Waterville, Berkey and Harbor View,\nand the townships of Swanton, Washington, Jerusalem, Waterville,\nSpencer, Springfield, Sylvania, Monclova, Providence, Richfield,\nand Harding.\n15.  In 1970, the population of Lucas County was 484,370\npersons:  427,541 (approximately  88%) were white; 54,694 (approx-\nimately 11%) were black; and 2,135  (less than 1%) were Mexican-\nAmerican or other minority group.\n16.  The population of Lucas County is racially segre-\ngated.  Approximately 97% of the black persons and about 86% of\nthe Mexican Americans and other minorities who reside in the\nCounty live in the City of Toledo and are concentrated in limited\n\n-6-\nsections of it.  The remaining minority group members reside\nin concentrated pockets in other parts of the County.\n17.  In the past several years, employment opportunities\nin the suburban areas of Lucas County have increased at a rate  /\nfar exceeding the rate of increase for the City of Toledo, where\nthe overwhelming majority of blacks, Mexican-Americans, and other\nminorities reside.\n18.  The racial composition of the public schools in\nLucas County reflects the racially segregated residential pat-\nterns of the area.\n19.  TMHA manages approximately  3,000 units of public\nhousing in the City of Toledo.  These dwellings have been pro-\nvided under cooperation agreements or resolutions with the City.\nTMHA has also entered into a cooperation agreement with Lucas  \\ -\nCounty calling for 100 units, of which only 52 have been\nerected.  All family public housing is located in the City of\nToledo, except for the 52 units which are located in a predom-\ninantly black and low-income area of the County called Spencer\nSharpies.\n20.  The TMHA waiting list for family unit public hous-\ning is composed of about 1,800 applicants, two-thirds of whom\nare blacks and Mexican-Americans.\n21.  In the past, TMHA has discriminated against minor-\nities in the administration and operation of its public housing\nprogram.\n22.  There is a substantial need in all areas within the\njurisdiction of TMHA for decent, safe, and sanitary  low-income\nhousing which plaintiffs and the class they represent can afford.\n23.  Before TMHA may construct or acquire low-income\nhousing, it must enter into a cooperation agreement with the\ngoverning body in whose jurisdiction the project is to be lo-\ncated.  42 USC 1115(7)(b).\n24.  Before TMHA may lease low-income housing, it must\nreceive approval by resolution from the governing body in whose\njurisdiction the leased housing is to be located.  42 USC\nb(a)(2).\n\n-7-\n25.  In the past several months, TMHA has been asked,\nthrough oral and written communications, to seek cooperation\nagreements and authorizing resolutions from each of the gov-\nerning bodies in Lucas County.  Despite these requests, defen-\ndants failed to seek cooperation agreements and resolutions.\nWithout such agreements or resolutions TMIIA is precluded from\nconstructing, acquiring, or leasing low-income housing outside\nthe City of Toledo.\nVII.  CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n26.  The defendants' failure to seek cooperation agree-\nmerits and authorizing resolutions from the governing-iEfodies of\nthe suburban communities has the effect of perpetuating resi-\ndential segregation, of impeding the right to travel, and of\ninterfering with the implementation of federal housing programs.\nAmong other consequences, the results have been to:\n(a)  Exclude low-income minorities from living\noutside areas of racial concentration;\n(b)  Confine low-income minorities to the City\nof Toledo;\n(c)  Maintain the all-white character and im-\nage of the suburban communities surround-\ning Toledo;\n(d)  Deprive white residents living in segre-\ngated neighborhoods of the benefits of\na racially integrated community; and\n(e)  Deny minority persons equal access to\nsuburban jobs and deny their children\nequal educational opportunities.\n27.  The conduct, acts, and practices of the defendants\ndescribed in the preceding paragraphs interfere with and deny\nrights secured to the plaintiffs and the class they represent\nby 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1982, 1983, 2000d, and 3601 et seq., and by\nthe Commerce Clause, Thirteenth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amend-\nment of the United States Constitution.  Unless restrained by\norder of this Court, the defendants will continue to engage in\nillegal activity and cause irreparable harm to plaintiffs and\nmembers of their class.\nVII.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, the plaintiffs pray that this Court cause\n\n-• R —\nthis case to be in every way expedited for a hearing on the\nmerits and, after such hearing, enter an order:\n(a)  Enjoining the defendants, their officers, agents,\nand employees, and all other persons acting in active concert\nor participation with any of them from:\n(1)  Engaging in any acts or practices\nwhich have the purpose or effect\nof denying equal housing opportunities\nbecause of race, color, religion, or\nnational origin, of obstructing or\nimpeding the right to travel, or of\ninterfering with the implementation\nof federal housing programs.\n(2)  Expending any funds, selling any\nbonds, entering into any contract,\nor taking any other steps to con-\nstruct or lease low-income housing\nin any area which is or may soon\nbecome racially impacted; and\n(b)  requiring the defendants, their officers, agents\nand employees to:\n(1)  Take all necessary steps to secure\ncooperation agreements and author-\nizing resolutions from each of the\ngoverning bodies in Lucas County;\n(2)  Submit to this Court, within 30 days,\na comprehensive plan for the dispersal\nof public housing throughout the terri-\ntorial jurisdiction of TMHA;\n(3)  Award each of the named plaintiffs and\nthe class they represent  compensatory\nand punitive damages in an amount to\nbe determined by the Court, and\n(•+)  Take reasonable steps to correct the\neffects of past discriminatory con-\nduct, including the implementation\nof a comprehensive plan of affirmative\naction.\nPlaintiffs pray for the recovery of all costs, including\nattorney fees, incurred in maintaining this action, and for such\nfurther relief as the interests of justice may require and this\nCourt deems appropriate.\n\n-9-\nRespectfully  submitted,\nJAY MULKEEN JOSEPH R.

Ohio, W.D.\nJune 6, 1989.\n844 *844 Jeanne Deimling Johns, A.B.L.E., Toledo, Ohio, for plaintiffs.\nWilliam Connelly and Kevin Joyce, Connelly, Soutar & Jackson, Toledo, Ohio, Andrea Newmark, Dept. of Justice,\nCivil Div., Anthony J. Ciccone, Jr., Trial Dept., Dept. of HUD, Washington, D.C., Charles Matuszynski, LMHA, and\nPatrick J. Foley, Asst. U.S. Atty., Toledo, Ohio, for defendants.\nOPINION AND ORDER\nMcQUADE, District Judge.\nThis matter is before the court on plaintiffs' motion for an interim award of attorneys' fees pursuant to the Civil\nRights Attorney's Fees Award Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S. C. § 3612(p), in the\namount of $303,630.00. The plaintiffs also request all costs and attorneys' fees associated with the preparation of\nthis motion, in an amount to be determined after a decision has been made.\nThis class action was filed in February, 1974, in the name of all low-income minority persons residing in the\nToledo metropolitan area who are unable to secure adequate housing in the Toledo metropolitan area without\nassistance from the Toledo [now Lucas] Metropolitan Housing Authority [\"LMHA\"]. The plaintiffs alleged that\nLMHA and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development [\"HUD\"] had violated the fifth,\nthirteenth and fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1982 and 1983; Title\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. §\n3601 et seq.; and the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. § 1437 et seq. The case was tried in January, 1978, and\nDistrict Judge Don J. Young issued an Opinion in May, 1983. Judge Young found that both LMHA and HUD were\nliable for intentional discrimination and segregation in LMHA's public housing programs. Judge Young awarded\nmonetary damages and equitable relief, and ordered the preparation of an affirmative action Plan to correct past\nsegregation.\nThe Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's finding that there had been impermissible internal segregation within\nLMHA's housing projects. Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, 758 F.2d 1086 (6th Cir.1985) (Jaimes\nI). The court, however, found that the plaintiffs lacked standing on their second claim that the defendants had\nprevented their obtaining fair housing opportunities in the suburbs of Toledo. Therefore, the Sixth Circuit reversed\n845 and set aside that part of the *845 order instructing the defendants to secure cooperation agreements with\nmunicipalities outside the city of Toledo in order to insure that public housing projects would be constructed in\nthose municipalities. The court also set aside awards of damages.\nThe Sixth Circuit heard a second appeal in which the court reviewed Judge Young's affirmative action. Jaimes v.\nLucas Metropolitan Housing Authority, 833 F.2d 1203 (6th Cir.1987) (Jaimes II). The court affirmed in part and\nreversed in part, and ordered the defendants to comply with the provisions of the affirmative action that were\nupheld. The Sixth Circuit also directed that the district court decide the issue of whether HUD should be held\nliable.\nThis court issued an Opinion and Order dated June 6, 1989, finding that HUD was liable for the discrimination in\npublic housing in Lucas County, and ordered HUD to comply with the terms of the affirmative action.\n\nAn award of attorneys' fees is authorized by the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1988: \"In any\naction or proceeding to enforce a provision of §§ 1981, 1982, 1983, ... of this Title, ..., or title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable\nattorney's fee as part of the costs.\"\nThe court must first determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to an award of attorneys' fees. Although an\naward of fees under § 1988 is a matter of the court's discretion, see 42 U.S.C. § 1988, a court should ordinarily\naward fees under the statute to a prevailing plaintiff \"`\"unless special circumstances would render such an award\nunjust.\"'\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1937, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (quoting S.Rep.\nNo. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, reprinted in 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 5908, 5912 (quoting \nNewman v. Piggie Park Enters. Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968))).\nThe first inquiry for this court is whether the plaintiffs are a \"prevailing party.\" The term is not defined in the\nstatute, but the Supreme Court has stated that plaintiffs are a prevailing party for purposes of attorney's fees \"`if\nthey succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in\nbringing the suit.'\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. at 1939 (quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275,\n278-79 (1st Cir.1978)).\n\"Prevailing party\" status does not depend on the plaintiffs' success on every issue litigated. A plaintiff who\nsucceeds on only some claims for relief may still be entitled to attorneys' fees. Id.461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. at\n1939. The Supreme Court declined to articulate a precise method for calculating a reasonable fee when a plaintiff\nachieves partial success. See id. at 435-37, 103 S.Ct. at 1940-41. Instead, the Court left such calculations to the\ndiscretion of the district court, counseling that a party who obtains excellent results should not receive a reduced\nfee simply because he failed to prevail on every issue, and a party who achieves limited success should not be\nawarded fees for every hour expended on the case. Id. \"The result is what matters.\" Id. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1940\n(footnote omitted). In affirming the Hensley standard, the Court recently stated:\nThe touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal\nrelationship of the parties in a manner which Congress sought to promote in the fee statute.\nWhere such change has occurred, the degree of the plaintiff's overall success goes to the\nreasonableness of the award under Hensley, not to the availability of a fee award vel non.\nTexas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. School Dist., ___ U.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 1493, 103 L.Ed.2d 866\n(1989).\nThe plaintiffs in this case pass the statutory threshold in that they succeeded on a significant issue in the case\nand effected a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties. The plaintiffs' suit has vindicated their\nrights to fair housing opportunities by enjoining LMHA and HUD from engaging in discriminatory practices that\n846 perpetuate segregation in public housing in *846 Lucas County. By seeking the enforcement of the federal\nhousing laws, the plaintiffs have served as private attorneys general, a role that Congress intended to promote by\nenacting § 1988. See id.109 S.Ct. at 1494. The plaintiffs are thus \"prevailing parties\" within the meaning of §\n1988, Hensley, and Texas State Teachers Association.\nThe next inquiry is to determine what is a \"reasonable\" fee. The starting point for determining a reasonable\nattorney's fee is to multiply the number of hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate. Blum v.\nStenson, 465 U.S. 886, 888, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1543, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984); Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct.\nat 1939. The court will evaluate the plaintiffs' claim for attorneys' fees under the standards enunciated in \nNorthcross v. Board of Educ. of Memphis City Schools, 611 F.2d 624 (6th Cir.1979),cert. denied,447 U.S. 911,\n100 S.Ct. 2999, 3000, 64 L.Ed.2d 862 (1980). Eight attorneys have submitted affidavits of the hours they worked\non this case. The following table sets forth the number of hours expended by each attorney and a suggested\nhourly rate.\n                   YEAR\n                 GRADUATED\n                   FROM         HOURS      HOURLY\n\n       ATTORNEY LAW SCHOOL    EXPENDED      RATE        TOTAL\n     --------------------------------------------------------\n     Galbreath    1974        1,118.05     $120     $134,166.00\n     Gmeiner      1976          319.75     $120       38,370.00\n     Johns        1981          352.50     $100       35,250.00\n     Tafelski     1971          519.05     $120       62,286.00\n     Wartelle     1976           97.25     $120       11,670.00\n     Frank        1965           20.00     $120        2,400.00\n     Muska        1977           30.00     $120        3,600.00\n     Petricoff    1974          132.40     $120       15,888.00\n                              ________              ____________\n             TOTAL            2,589.45              $303,630.00\nIn determining whether the number of hours claimed is reasonable, the court is mindful that the Supreme Court\nhas stated that the district court should exclude from the initial calculation any hours not reasonably expended on\nthe litigation. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. at 1939 (quoting S.Rep. No. 1011, 94th Cong.2d Sess. 6, \nreprinted in 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News 5908, 5913). This court has reviewed the attorneys' affidavits\nand finds the number of hours claimed by each attorney to be reasonable. The attorneys are expected to\nexercise \"billing judgment,\" id. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941, and these affidavits, in general, reflect sound legal\njudgment as to the number of hours required for particular tasks. This is not to say, however, that the court will\ncompensate the attorneys for every hour listed in their affidavits. There are two factors that may warrant a\nreduction of the number of hours. First, should the number of hours be reduced to account for the fact that the\nplaintiffs did not prevail on all their claims? See Texas State Teachers Ass'n, 109 S.Ct. at 1492; Hensley, 461\nU.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941.\nPlaintiffs' claims in this case may be divided into two broad categories: (1) claims related to discrimination and\nsegregation within the LMHA housing projects; and (2) claims related to the failure of LMHA and HUD to enter\ninto cooperation agreements with suburban communities to construct affordable housing outside the city of\nToledo. On the first claim, the plaintiffs were successful before the district court and were affirmed on appeal. As\nto the second claim, however, the Sixth Circuit held that the plaintiffs lacked standing, and therefore, dismissed\nthose claims.\nIf this were a case where the plaintiffs pressed two unrelated claims and prevailed as to one but not the other, it\n847 would be *847 logical for the court to reduce the number of hours by fifty percent (50%). Several factors convince\nthe court, however, that this is not such a case.\nThe Ninth Circuit has articulated a two-part analysis to determine whether the number of hours should be\nreduced where a plaintiff's success is not total.\nFirst, the court asks whether the claims upon which the plaintiff failed to prevail were related to the\nplaintiff's successful claims. If unrelated, the final fee award may not include time expended on the\nunsuccessful claims. If the unsuccessful claims are related, then the court must apply the second\npart of the analysis, in which the court evaluates the \"significance of the overall relief obtained by\nthe plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended.\" If the plaintiff obtained \"excellent\nresults,\" full compensation may be appropriate, but if only \"partial or limited success\" was\nobtained, full compensation may be excessive.\nThorne v. City of El Segundo, 802 F.2d 1131, 1141 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at\n1940). See also Fite v. First Tennessee Prod. Credit Ass'n, 861 F.2d 884, 894 (6th Cir.1988) (applying\nsubstantially similar analysis).\nThe plaintiffs' unsuccessful suburban housing claim is related to their successful internal segregation claim: the\nunsuccessful claim is based on the same legal theory and arises under the same statutory and constitutional\nprovisions as the internal segregation claim, but involves different facts and remedies. This is not a case where\nthe two claims are virtually identical (e.g., a case raising Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 claims), nor is it a case\nwhere the claims are so unrelated that they should be treated as if raised in different lawsuits.\n\nThe court also finds that the results obtained by the plaintiffs are substantial. An affirmative action plan is now in\neffect which will attempt to undo decades of de jure and de facto segregation in public housing in Lucas County.\nThe court concludes that some reduction of the award is appropriate, but that a fifty percent (50%) reduction\nwould be excessive. The Supreme Court stated that the court may either identify and eliminate specific hours or\nsimply reduce the award to account for the partial success. Texas State Teachers Ass'n, 109 S.Ct. at 1492 (citing \nHensley, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941). The affidavits of the plaintiffs' attorneys do not reflect which hours\nwere spent on which claims, so the court cannot identify and eliminate specific hours expended on the suburban\nhousing claim. Considering that the two claims are related but involve distinct facts and remedies, and that the\nsuccess achieved by the plaintiff is substantial but not complete, the court concludes that is is therefore\nappropriate to reduce the number of hours by twenty-five percent (25%) to reflect the plaintiffs' failure on the\nsuburban housing claim. Compare Zook v. Brown, 865 F.2d 887, 895-96 (7th Cir. 1989) (affirming reduction of fee\naward by 75% where plaintiff prevailed only as to a portion of one out of three claims) with Gilmere v. City of\nAtlanta, 864 F.2d 734, 741-42 (11th Cir.1989) (affirming reduction of fee award by 25% where plaintiff prevailed\nas to § 1983 claim against individual police officers but not against municipality) and Cabrales v. County of Los\nAngeles, 864 F.2d 1454, 1464-66 (9th Cir.1988) (affirming reduction of fee award by 25% where plaintiff prevailed\nas to Monell claim against county but not as to claims against individual defendants).\nThe second factor is whether the number of hours should be reduced to eliminate duplication of services. In \nNorth-cross, the court held that in complicated cases involving many lawyers, the court may deduct a percentage\nof the total hours to eliminate duplication of services. 611 F.2d at 637 (citing Oliver v. Kalamazoo Bd. of Educ.,\n576 F.2d 714 (6th Cir.1978)). The court finds that, for the most part, the attorneys' affidavits do not indicate\nduplication of services. On the contrary, this case seems to have been leanly staffed for the most part. In\npreparing for trial, two attorneys logged time on this case, but given the complexity and magnitude of the case,\n848 the court does not find two lawyers to be excessive. The fact that several lawyers *848 handled this case does\nnot justify a reduction for duplication of services. In a case that spans fourteen years, it is reasonable that\nindividual attorneys may come and go. The amount of time a new attorney spent in acquainting herself with the\ncase is de minimis; even an attorney on the case from the start would have to review records and refamiliarize\nhimself after a period of years. The one instance of duplicative services causing excessive hours was the\npreparation of post trial briefs. Kathleen A. Gmeiner's affidavit states that she spent approximately 100.75 hours\npreparing the plaintiffs' post trial brief. Glenn G. Galbreath claims to have spent approximately 167 hours on the\nsame task. For drafting reply briefs, Gmeiner claims 29 hours and Galbreath claims 100 hours. The court finds\n267.75 hours for a post trial brief and 129 hours for a reply brief to be \"excessive, redundant, or otherwise\nunnecessary.\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. at 1939-40. Those hours should, therefore, be reduced by\n50%, or 198 hours, rounded to the nearest hour.\nThe court, therefore, determines that the reasonable number of hours in this case is the number of hours stated\nin the attorneys' affidavits (2589.45 hours), first reduced by 198 hours to account for duplicative services and then\nreduced by twenty-five percent (25%) to account for partial success, for a total of 1793 hours (rounded to the\nnearest hour).\nThe next question is what hourly rate should be applied to the reasonable number of hours. In Northcross, the\ncourt held that an award of attorneys' fees should reflect the fair market value of the services provided. 611 F.2d\nat 638. The fair market value is generally calculated as the hourly rate charged customarily by attorneys in the\ncommunity. Id. Some courts have concluded that the hourly rate charged at the time the award is made, rather\nthan the rate charged when the services were rendered, is more appropriate in order to compensate for inflation,\nforegone interest and delay in payment. Daly v. Hill, 790 F.2d 1071, 1081 (4th Cir.1986); Ramos v. Lamm, 713\nF.2d 546, 555 (10th Cir.1983): Arthur S. Langenderfer, Inc. v. S.E. Johnson, Co., No. 76-425, slip op. at 5-6\n(N.D.Ohio Jan. 11, 1988). The Sixth Circuit has cautioned that Northcross and the discretionary nature of fee\nawards do not require that awards be adjusted for inflation, but the court should consider whether such\nadjustment is called for in light of the facts of the case. Louisville Black Police Officers v. City of Louisville, 700\nF.2d 268, 274-75 (6th Cir.1983). If the court determines that adjustment for inflation is appropriate, it can either\napply a current hourly rate or enhance the entire award by an appropriate amount. See id. at 275; Johnson v.\nUniversity College of the University of Alabama, 706 F.2d 1205, 1210-11 (11th Cir.),cert. denied,464 U.S. 994,\n\n104 S.Ct. 489, 78 L.Ed.2d 684 (1983). This court concludes that in this case, some adjustment for inflation is\nappropriate and that using the current market rate is the most reasonable method of calculating that adjustment.\nLMHA suggests that even if the court awards fees based on current hourly rates, the fees should not be based on\ncurrent levels of experience. For example, LMHA suggests that a person who currently has ten years of\nexperience should not be compensated at the ten-year level for work that he performed fresh out of law school.\nLMHA's argument is not supported by caselaw, and it violates the animating principle of the fee statute of\nencouraging attorneys to take on complicated civil rights cases such as the one sub judice. See Hensley, 461\nU.S. at 429, 103 S.Ct. at 1937 (§ 1988 intended \"to ensure `effective access to the judicial process' for persons\nwith civil rights grievances\" (quoting H.Rep. No. 1558, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1976)).\nIn cases where the court has awarded fees at current rates, the court generally does not differentiate as to levels\nof experience. E.g., Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority, 690 F.2d 601, 612 (7th Cir. 1982) (affirming a rate of\n$125.00 per hour for all services performed by an attorney over a fourteen-year period), cert. denied,461 U.S.\n849 961, 103 S.Ct. 2438, 77 L.Ed.2d 1322 (1983); Akron Center for Reproductive*849Health v. City of Akron, 604\nF.Supp. 1275, 1288-92 (N.D.Ohio 1985) (compensating attorneys for work done over seven years at an hourly\nfee based on levels of experience at time of fee application). The fact that attorneys generally take these civil\nrights cases without an expectation of payment unless there are victorious is reason to compensate them based\non current levels of experience. The court in Northcross approved the district court's consideration of the\ncontingency of compensation as a factor for enhancing the routine hourly rate. 611 F.2d at 638. An attorney's\nhourly billing is based on the expectation of payment regardless of the outcome of the case. In contingency\ncases, where payment will only be had in the event of victory, an upward adjustment is appropriate to\ncompensate the attorney for the risk of not being paid at all. See Conklin v. Lovely, 834 F.2d 543, 553-54 (6th\nCir.1987) (approving enhancement of fee to compensate for contingency element provided that district court\nmakes specific factual findings). Northcross cautions us, however, that in a long, complicated lawsuit, once\nliability is established, the contingency factor disappears and compensation for establishing a remedy, monitoring\nthe decree and recovery fees should not include an upward adjustment for contingency. Id.\nThis case was filed in 1974 and went to trial in 1978. Judge Young did not issue a decision until 1983, and his\ndecision was affirmed in part and reversed in part in 1985. An affirmative action plan was created in 1985 and\naffirmed with some exceptions in 1987. LMHA's liability was not settled until the first appeal to the Sixth Circuit\nwas decided in 1985. The fee award should therefore reflect the contingent nature of the case during the first\neleven years of the case. To compensate the attorneys based on their current levels of experience will best\naccomplish that adjustment. See City of Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 2692-93, 91 L.Ed.2d\n466 (1986) (approving award where district court compensated attorney at prevailing market rate even though\nattorney was inexperienced when litigation began).\nAs evidence of the current market rate for attorneys' services in Toledo, the plaintiffs submit the fee schedule of\ntheir attorneys, Advocates for Basic Legal Equality [\"ABLE\"] and the affidavit of Daniel J. Steinbock, an associate\nProfessor of Law at the University of Toledo, who studied the rates of attorneys in Toledo in March, 1988. ABLE,\na nonprofit corporation, employs twenty-one attorneys and has established the following schedule of fees.\nYEARS OF EXPERIENCE     HOURLY RATE\n      0-2                  $ 60\n      3-5                  $ 80\n      6-10                 $100\n      11 and over          $120\n      law clerks           $ 30\nProfessor Steinbock states that among medium-sized law firms in Toledo (10-19 lawyers), the average hourly\nrate for senior partners is $120.00. Among larger law firms (20 or more lawyers), the average hourly rate for\nsenior partners if $124.00. For junior partners, the average hourly rate at medium-sized firms is $100.00 and at\nlarger firms, $102.00. The plaintiffs' request for $120.00 per hour for an attorney with more than eleven years of\n\nexperience and $100.00 for an attorney with six to ten years of experience is a reasonable request in light of\nprevailing market rates for attorneys with comparable experience in Toledo.\nAs a final matter, the court must determine whether liability for the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees should be apportioned\nbetween the two defendants, LMHA and HUD. When this motion for an interim award of attorneys' fees was filed,\nthe issue of HUD's liability had not been resolved. The plaintiffs, therefore, sought fees only from LMHA. In view\nof this court's determination that HUD is liable for the plaintiffs' claims, the court concludes that it is appropriate to\ndetermine whether HUD should bear a portion of the fees award.\nIn Council for Periodical Distributors Ass'ns v. Evans, 827 F.2d 1483, 1487-88 (11th Cir.1987), the court stated\nthat the district court has discretion whether and how to divide liability for fees. In cases where the defendants\n850 participated equally *850 in the wrongdoing, the court may hold the defendants jointly and severally liable for\nfees, or the court may divide the fees equally among the defendants. Id. at 1487; Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin,\n749 F.2d 945, 959 (1st Cir.1984). Fees may also be divided according to the relative culpability of each\ndefendant. Evans, 827 F.2d at 1488; Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 960; Jose P. v. Ambach, 669 F.2d 865, 871 (2d\nCir. 1982). It may also be appropriate to apportion fees according to the amount of time spent by the plaintiff in\npreparing the case against each defendant. Evans, 827 F.2d at 1488; Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 960; Southeast\nLegal Defense Group v. Adams, 657 F.2d 1118, 1125-26 (9th Cir.1981).\nSeveral factors influence this court's decision to apportion fees. First, HUD has been a defendant in this case\nsince 1975, and plaintiffs have expended considerable effort in proving HUD's participation and responsibility for\nillegal discrimination in public housing administered by LMHA and funded by HUD. Second, in view of the fact\nthat LMHA was responsible for on-the-scene administration of public housing, LMHA assigned tenants to\nparticular units, and LMHA maintained the waiting list, while HUD provided funds, authorized the three refusal\npolicy, and exercised a general supervisory function, LMHA should bear more of the responsibility than HUD for\nthe discrimination and segregation in public housing. See Evans, 827 F.2d at 1487 (\"[I]t may be appropriate for a\ndistrict court to apportion fees between the active instigator of a wrong and a more passive co-defendant who\nhad a more peripheral or ministerial role in the wrong.\").\nIf this were a case where both defendants contributed equally to the injury suffered by the plaintiffs, then the court\nwould be inclined to apportion damages equally between the two defendants. In this case, however, although\nHUD has been found to be liable for the injury to the plaintiffs, the court is satisfied that LMHA bears more of the\ndirect responsibility for the plaintiffs' injury. Because the attorneys' affidavits do not reflect which hours were spent\npreparing the case against which defendant, the court cannot apportion fees on an hourly basis. Therefore, the\ncourt finds that LMHA is liable for two-thirds of the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and HUD is liable for one-third of the\nfees.\nIn holding the United States liable for fees, the court may not compensate at a current hourly rate in order to\naccount for delay of payment. In Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 92 L.Ed.2d 250\n(1986), the Court held that an award of attorneys' fees against the United States, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, may not compensate attorneys at current hourly rates in order to account for delay of\npayment because the no-interest rule renders the United States immune from an award of interest, in the\nabsence of express congressional waiver of that immunity. Compare Loeffler v. Frank, ___ U.S. ___, 108\nS.Ct.1965, 1974, 100 L.Ed.2d 549 (1988) (holding that interest may be awarded against Postal Service because\nin creating the Postal Service Congress \"cast off the cloak of sovereignty and assumed the status of a private\ncommercial enterprise\" (quoting Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 2963 n. 5, 92\nL.Ed.2d 250 (1986)). Because there is no express waiver of the United States' immunity with respect to interest in\n§ 1988, the court concludes that as to the number of hours for which HUD is liable, plaintiffs' attorneys may not\nbe compensated at the current hourly rate. The court does not have sufficient evidence to set a reasonable\nhourly rate for the years 1974 to 1978 and 1983 to 1987. The parties will, therefore, supply the court with such\nevidence according to the schedule set forth below.\nThe plaintiffs have claimed that their attorneys spent 2589.45 hours on their case up to September, 1988. This\nfigure will be reduced by 198 hours to account for duplicative services and an excessive number of hours in\npreparing post trial briefs. The remaining number of hours, 2391, will be reduced by twenty-five (25%) to account\nfor the plaintiffs' partial success. The reasonable number of hours, rounded to the nearest hour, is therefore 1793.\n\n851 LMHA is liable for 1195 hours and HUD is liable for *851 598 hours. The reasonable hourly rate for those hours\nassessed against LMHA is $120 per hour for hours worked by attorneys with more than eleven years experience\n(1018 hours) and $100 per hour for hours worked by attorneys with six-to-seven-years experience (177 hours).\nLMHA is therefore liable for $139,860.00 in fees.\nIt is therefore\nORDERED that plaintiff shall provide this court, within five (5) days of the receipt of this order, with evidence of\nthe hourly rate of attorneys in Toledo during the years 1974 to 1978 and 1983 to 1987;\nFURTHER ORDERED that defendant HUD shall have five (5) days from the plaintiffs' submission to respond;\nFURTHER ORDERED that defendant LMHA shall pay to plaintiffs' counsel, Advocates for Basic Legal Equality,\nthe sum of One Hundred Thirty Nine Thousand Eight Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($139,860.00), plus\ninterest, from the date of this order.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

It is also brought to restrain\ninterference with the right to travel and with the implementation\nof Federal housing programs.\n2. This suit is instituted by low-income, minority\npersons residing in the Toledo metropolitan area on behalf of\nthemselves and all other low-income minority residents living in\nthe Toledo metropolitan area who seek the opportunity  to live in\ndecent, safe, and sanitary housing in suburban areas outside\nareas of minority concentration.\nII. JURISDICTION\n3. This Court has jurisdiction of the action pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. 1331, 1343, 1361, and 42 U.S.C. 3612 and 3617.\nThe amount in controversy exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000)\nexclusive of interest and costs.\n4. The Plaintiffs' claims for relief are predicated upon\n42 U.S.C. , 1401,. .et.sei,' 19aiy 1982, 1983, 2000d, and 3601, et seq. ,\nand upon the Commerce Clause, the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.\nIII. PLAINTIFFS\n5. Plaintiff Josie Jaitnes, a Mexican-American, is a\ncitizen of the United States who resides in Toledo, Ohio.\nUntil her house was condemned in November, 1973 by the Lucas\nCounty Health Department, she and her six (6) children lived\nIn Sylvania, a suburb of Toledo, in a two (2) room house which\nhad no running water, no toilet facilities, defective wiring,\nand inadequate heat.  She had lived in the Sylvania area for\napproximately nineteen  (19) years.  She and her family would\nlike to live in the Sylvania area for reasons of employment,\nschools, and personal ties, but they are unable to afford decent,\nsafe, and sanitary housing without the assistance of the Toledo\nMetropolitan Housing Authority  (TMHA).  When she applied for a\n-2-\n\npublic housing unit at TMHA, Plaintiff Jairaes was advised that\nno such housing is.\" located in the Sylvania area.  She is on the\nTMHA waiting list.\n6. Plaintiff Tomas Gonzales, a Mexican-American, is\na citizen of the United States who resides with the other seven\n(7) members of his family in Sylvania in a two (2) room house\nwhich has no running water and no toilet facilities.  He has\nlived in the Sylvania area for approximately  twenty-two (22)\nyears.  Plaintiff Gonzales would like to live in decent, safe,\nand sanitary housing in the Sylvania area, but is unable to\nafford such housing without the assistance of TMHA.  He is on\nthe TMHA waiting list.\n7. Plaintiff Clarence Turner, a black American, is a\ncitizen of the United States who resides with his family in a\nTMHA public housing development which is predominantly black\nand which is located in a racially concentrated area of Toledo.\nI\ni  His children attend racially segregated schools.  He has to\nj\ntravel to his job in Wood County, Ohio because he is unable to\nafford housing in proximity to his work.  Plaintiff Turner would\nlike to live with his family in the Maumee area, but is unable\nto afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing without the\nassistance of TMHA.\n8. Plaintiff Patricia Davis, a black American, is a\ncitizen of the United States who resides with her family in a\nTMHA public housing development which is predominantly black\nand which is located in a racially concentrated area of Toledo.\nHer children attend racially segregated schools.  She would\nlike the opportunity  to live in the suburbs of Toledo, but is\nunable to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing without the\nj  assistance of TMHA.\ni\n!  «\nIV.  CLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS\n9.  This  is  a class  action brought  pursuant  to Rule  23\n(a)(b)(l)(A)  and  (B) , (b)(2)  and  (b)(3)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of\nCivil  Procedure.\n— 3 —\n\n10. The class consists of all low-income residents of\nthe greater Toledo-, Ohio area who by virtue of their race and\nj\npoverty are unable to secure decent, safe, and sanitary housing\nat rents or prices which they can afford without the assistance\ny\nof Defendant TMHA.  The class is so numerous that the joinder\nof all members is impracticable.  The exact size of the class is\ni  •  •\nunknown, but an indication of the class size is the TMHA waiting\ni\nlist for family housing units, which presently consists of approxi-\nmately one thousand eight hundred  (1,800) individuals who are\nmembers of this class.  There are questions of law and fact\ncommon to thi class.  The common question of law and fact is\nwhether Defendants' provision and location of public housing in\n!  /'\nI  '\nthe Toledo area has denied Plaintiffs and their class their\nrights under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\nThe claims of the representative parties are typical of the\n;  \\\nclaims of the above mentioned class.  The Plaintiffs will fairly\n\\  (  .  \\\nand Adequately protect the interests of their class because they\n\\  !  )\nare members of the class and hav^ no known adverse interest to\n' V  : i  I , \\\nthe class.  Prosecution of separate actions by individual members\nof the class would create a risk of (a) inconsistent or varying\nI\nadjudications w|th respect to individual, members of the class\nwhich tfould establish incompatible standards of conduct for the\nDefendants, and (b) adjudications with respect to individual\nmembers of the class which would, as a practical matter, be\ndispositive of-the interest of the other members not parties\nto the adjudication or substantially impede their ability to\n..protect their interests.  The Defendants have acted or refused to\nact, on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\nappropriate final injunctlve relief with respect to the class\nas a whole.  The questions of law and fact common to the class\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members,\nand a class action is superior to other available methods for a\nfair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  There is no\nconflict among the interests in individually controlling the\n\nprosecution and defense of separate actions.  There is no known\nlitigation presently pending concerning similar claims involving\nany members of the class.  This Court is a desirable forum in\nwhich to concentrate the litigation of the claims of the class\nsince it has the power to hear all the claims and to grant\nappropriate relief.  There are not likely to be any difficulties\nin the management of a class action in notice to the members of\nthe class, since the whereabouts of all the members of the class\nis known.\nV. DEFENDANTS\n11. Defendant Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority  (TMHA)\nis a body corporate and politic established under the laws of the\nState of Ohio,  Ohio Revised Code (O.R.C.) 3735.27 et seq.  It\nhas the responsibility  and authority to provide, through construc-\ntion, acquisition, and/or leasing, low-income housing in all\nareas of Lucas County except Harding Township.  Under the United\nStates Housing Act of 1937, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1401, et seq.,\nthe United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is\nthe principal source of financial assistance for such housing.\n12. Defendant Barrett is the Director of TMHA and as such,\nis charged with the administration and general supervision of\nits housing programs.\n13. Defendants Flory, Borrell, Chadwell, Daig and Dennis\nare members of the TMHA Board of Commissioners appointed pursuant\nto O.R.C. 3735.27, who determine the policies of TMHA.\n14. Defendant United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development  (HUD) is an Executive Department of the United\nStates and is TMHA's primary funding source.\n15. Defendant Carla Hills is the Secretary of the United\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development and is the\nChief Administrator of Federal housing and urban development\nprograms.  She is responsible for the overall administration,\n-5-\n\nreview, approval, and execution of Federal housing and urban\ndevelopment programs, including the low rent public housing\nprograms, 42 U.S.C. 1401, et seq.\n16. Defendant Don Morrow is the Regional Administrator\nfor Region V of the United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development and is responsible for the administration,\nreview, approval, and execution of Federal housing and urban\ndevelopment pro grams,including the low rent public housing\nprograms, 42 U.S.C. 51401, et seq., in the cities located in\nthat region.  Lucas County, Ohio is located in Region V.\n17. Defendant Paul Lydens is the Director of the Columbus,\nOhio Area Office of the United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Deveopment and is responsible for the administration,\nreview, approval, and execution of Federal housing and urban\ndevelopment programs, including the low rent public housing\nprograms, 42 U.S.C. 1401, et seq. , located within that area.\nLucas County, Ohio is located in the Columbus Area.\nVI. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n18. Lucas County, Ohio is composed of the municipalities\nof Toledo, Sylvania, Mautnee , and Oregon, the villages of Ottawa\nHills, Holland, Whitehouse, Waterville, Berkey and Harbor View,\nand the townships of Swanton, Washington, Jerusalem, Watervillej\nSpencer, Springfield, Sylvania, Monclova, Providence, Richfield,\nand Harding.\n19. In 1970, the population of Lucas County was 484,370 ;  .\npersons:  427,541 (approximately 88%) were white; 54,694\n(approximately 11%) were black; and 2,135  (less than 1%) were\nMexican-American or other minority group.\n20. The population of Lucas County is racially segregated.\nApproximately 97% of the black persons and about 86% of the Mexican\nAmericans and other minorities who reside in the County live in\nthe City of Toledo and are concentrated in limited sections of it.\nThe remaining minority group members reside in concentrated\npockets in other parts of the County.\n-6-\n\n21. In the past several years, employment  opportunities\nin the suburban areas of Lucas County have increased at a rate\nfar exceeding the rate of increase for the City of Toledo,\nwhere the overwhelming majority of blacks, Mexican-Americans,\nand other minorities reside.\n22. The racial composition of the public schools in\nLucas County reflects the racially segregated  residential\npatterns of the area.\n23. TMHA manages approximately  3,000 units of public\nhousing in the City of Toledo.  These dwellings have been\nprovided under cooperation agreements or resolutions with the\nCity.  TMKA h-?? also entered into a cooperation agreement with\nLucas County calling for 100 units, of which only 52 have been\nerected.  All family public housing is located in the City of\n!  Toledo, except for the 52 units which are located in a\ni\npredominantly black and low-income area of the County called\nSpencer Sharpies.\n;  24. The TMHA waiting list for family public housing\n'  units is composed of about 1,800 applicants, two-thirds of whom\nare blacks and Mexican-Americans.\n25. In the past, TMHA has maintained policies and\npractices of racial discrimination and segregation in the\nI  administration and operation of its public housing program.\n26. TMHA1? past policies and practices have contributed\n|i|  substantially to the racially segregated character of Lucas County\nI\nI  27. There is a substantial need in all areas within the\ni\njurisdiction  of  THIIA  for  decect ,  safe,  and  sanitary  low-income\nv!\nji  housing which ^Iaisi-irrs and the members of their class can afford\n'I  *\nii  28. Eefcre TMHA may construct or acquire low-income\njj  conventional public housing, it must enter into a cooperation\nagreement with the governing body in whose jurisdiction the\nproject is to be located.  There are presently  conventional\nfamily public housing units under reservation from HUD to TMHA.\n-7-\ni\n\n29. In August 1974, Congress enacted the Community\nDevelopment Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-383) which, inter alia\nincludes a new lor; income public housing program commonly\nreferred to as Section 8.  Under the Section 8 program, 42 U.S.C.\n1437 f., TMHA may participate as both an administrator and\ndeveloper,\n30. Beginning in 1972, TMHA has been asked, through\noral and written communications, to seek cooperation agreements\nand authorizing resolutions from each of the governing bodies\nin Lucas County.  Despite these requests, Defendants refused\nand failed to seek cooperation agreements and resolutions,\nand have refused and failed to take all necessary steps to locate\npublic housing outside the City of Toledo.  Without such\nagreements, TMHA is precluded from constructing or acquiring,\nconventional public housing outside the City of Toledo.\n31. HUD provides financial support to TMHA in the form\nof loans and annual contributions for the administration and\noperation of the TMHA public housing program.  In addition\nto this financial support, HUD also has responsibility for\nreviewing and approving all policies and practices of TMHA\nin the administration and operation of its public housing\nprogram, including policies and practices relating to tenant\nassignment and site selection.\n32. In the past, HUD has knowingly approved and\nfinancially supported TMHA's policies and practices of racial\ndiscrimination and segregation in the administration and\noperation of the TMHA public housing program.\n33. Under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968,\nA2 U.S.C. 3601, et seq., Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights\nAct, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, Executive Order 11063, HUD•is required\nto ensure that its housing and urban development programs\nprovide minorities with the full enjoyment of equal housing\nopportunities.  HUD has failed to ensure that its programs are\n-8-\n\no\nadministered  in an affirmative manner to achieve equal housing\nopportunities.\n34. In October,1973, in response to an administrative\ncomplaint filed by individuals and various neighborhood\norganizations in the City of Toledo, officials in the HUD\nColumbus Area Office determined, inter alia, that the Toledo\nMetropolitan Housing Authority  should be seeking  cooperation\nagreements from the local governing bodies within its\nj urisdiction.\n35. Defendants HUD, Uills, Morrow, and Lydens have\nfailed and refused  to take all necessary, appropriate and\neffective action to ensure that TMHA seek cooperation  agreements\nand resolutions from the local governing bodies within its\njurisdiction and that public housing be located in the\nsuburban communities of said jurisdiction pursuant to Title VIII,\nof the Civi^, Rights Act of.l96§, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et aeql, Title VI\nof the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, and the regulations\npromulgated pursuant  thereto, and have failed and refused\nto impose sanctions within their power to impose.\n36. Defendants HUD, Hills, Morrow, and Lydens continue\nto advance money and encourage TMHA to advertise for family\npublic housing units inside the City of Toledo, while at the\nsame time they have instructed TMHA not to seek cooperation\nagreements and resolutions from the other local governing bodies\nwithin its jurisdiction.\nVII. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n37. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nthe allegations of paragraphs 1 through 36, as set forth above.\n38. Defendants TMHA, Flory, Dorrell, Chadwell, Daig, and\nDennis' failure to seek cooperation agreements and authorizing\nresolutions from the governing bodies of the suburban  communities\nwithin the TMHA jurisdiction, and their failure to take all\nnecessary and appropriate steps to locate public housing in\n-9-\n\n'/  ./'\n/•  /•\nsaid communities has the effect of perpetuating  racial  residential\nsegregation, of inpeding  the right  to travel, and of interfer-\ning with the proper implementation  and execution of Federal\nhousing programs.  Among other  consequences, the results have\nbeen to:\n(a) Exclude low-income minorities  from\nliving outside areas of racial con-\ncentration ;\n(b) Confine low-income minorities  to the\nCity of Toledo;\n(c) Maintain  the all-white  character and\nimage of the suburban  communities\nsurrounding Toledo;\n(d) Deprive white residents  living in\nsegregated  neighborhoods  of the\nbenefits of a racially  integrated\ncommunity; and\n(e) Deny minority  persons equal access to\nsuburban jobs and deny  their  children\nequal educational  opportunities.\n39. The conduct, acts, and practices of the Defendants\ndescribed  in the preceding paragraphs interfere with and deny\nrights secured to the Plaintiffs  and the members of their\nclass by 42 U.S.C. 1401, et s_ej... , 1981, 1982, 1983, 2000d, and\n3601, zt_ seq, , and by the Commerce Clause, and the Thirteenth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States  Constitution.\nUnless restrained by order of this Court, the defendants will\ncontinue  to engage  in illegal activity  and cause  irreparable\nharm to plaintiffs  and the members of their class.\nVIII. SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\ni-v). Plaintiffs  reallege and incorporate by reference\nthe allegations of paragraphs  1 through  36, as set forth above.\n41. Defendants U.S. Department  of Housing  and Urban\nDevelopment, Hills, Morrow, and Lydens', failure to require\nTMHA  to seek cooperation  agreements  and authorizing  resolutions\nfrom governing bodies of the suburban  communities within  the\nTMHA jurisdiction  and their failure to take all necessary  and\n-10-\n\n0\nr'\nappropriate steps to place public housing 'within said  suburban\ncommunities has the effect of perpetuating racial residential\nsegregation, of impeding  the right to travel, and of interfering\nwith the proper implementation and exeuction of Federal housing\nprograms.  Among other consequences, the results have been to:\n(a) Exclude low-income minorities  from\nlivli^ -)u':3ide areas of racial con-\ncentration;\n(b) Confine low-income minorities to the\nCity of Toledo;\n(c) Maintain the all-white character and\nimage of the suburban communities\nsurrounding Toledo;\n(d) Deprive white residents living in\nsegregated neighborhoods of the\nbenefits of a racially  integrated\ncommunity; and\n(e) Deny minority persons equal access to\nsuburban jobs and deny their children\nequal educational opportunities.\n42. The conduct, acts, practices, and policies of the\nDefendants described in the preceding paragraphs  interfere\nwith and deny rights secured  to the Plaintiffs and the members\nof their class by 42 U.S.C. 1401 e± seq. , 1981, 1982, 2000d,\n3601, et_ seq. , and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto,\nand the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.  Unless restrained by order of this Court, the\nDefendants will continue to engage in illegal activity and\ncause irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and the members of their\nclass.\nIX.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nWESTERN DIVISION\nINDIA GRAYSON, et al., \nPlaintiff, Case No. 3:74 CV 68\n-vs-\nTOLEDO METROPOLITAN AMENDED\nHOUSING AUTHORITY, et al.,  MEMORANDUM OPINION\nDefendant.\nKATZ, J.\nA class of plaintiffs brought this action in 1974, alleging the defendants Lucas Metropolitan\nHousing Authority (then the Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority) and United States Department of\nHousing and Urban Development were segregating minorities from non-minorities when building and\ndoling out housing. The Court found for the plaintiffs and entered an order that mandated adherence to an\nAffirmative Action Plan (AAP) designed to correct these practices and undo their effects. A series of\nappeals and later entries served to both uphold and hone the plan’s language. The Court recently approved\na class substitution, entering India Grayson as a named plaintiff in lieu of Josie Jaimes, the former named\nplaintiff. Doc. 263. Ms. Grayson has filed a motion to modify the AAP and the Court issued an order on\nthreshold issues, Doc. 259, clearing the way to address Ms. Grayson’s motion to modify. The three parties\nhave stipulated to certain facts upon which the Court will rely. Doc. 266. Both LMHA and HUD oppose\nMs. Grayson’s proposed modification. \nMs. Grayson takes a broad look at public housing in Lucas County and asks the Court to create a\nnew AAP that addresses the realities LMHA and HUD face today, such as the fact that some, but not full\nprogress has been made towards racial integration; LMHA has shifted to a stronger focus on administering\nSection 8 (the housing choice voucher program); the racial makeup of public housing tenants has changed;\nand LMHA is rebuilding and repurposing inner city housing projects that were central to the original racial\nsegregation finding. Ms. Grayson asks the Court to modify the AAP to account for and monitor progress in\n\nthis changing landscape. Only two narrow avenues exist for modifying the former judgment of the Court.\nFirst, when it created the AAP, the Court carved in a modification tool: the AAP could be modified either\nby agreement of the parties or when one party can show the Court that progress towards the plan’s\nobjectives is no longer being made. Second, the Court has the power under FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL\nPROCEDURE 60(b) to relieve a party from a judgment for a variety of reasons, including when the\nprospective application of that judgment is no longer equitable. These two avenues overlap significantly,\nbut neither party has provided the Court with authority that would indicate that to “relieve a party” could\ninclude revising a plan to impose new restrictions on that party. In other words, neither party has provided\nthe Court with authority demonstrating that a plaintiff can move under Rule 60(b) to make a judgment more\nstringent upon a defendant, which is exactly what Ms. Grayson requests. Since the Court’s own order has a\nprovision for modification, the Court need not resolve the Rules question and can just apply the order’s\nprovision to determine if modification is appropriate. \nBy the terms of the Court’s prior order, Jaimes v. Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority, No. 74-\n68, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12980 (December 10, 1985), Ms. Grayson, as the movant, must demonstrate\nthat progress is not being made toward achieving the objectives of the AAP, of which there are three:\nreducing racial segregation in LMHA projects, remedying the effects of past discrimination, and assuring\nequal access to housing. Id. at 16. Ms. Grayson has also asked the Court to determine whether the AAP has\nachieved the Court’s goals. See e.g., Doc. 240 at 2; Doc. 246 at 2. In 1985, the Court said that the objective\nof remedying past discrimination “shall be achieved” by maintaining each family public housing location\nbetween 72.5% - 77.5% minority and 22.5% - 27.5% non-minority and each senior housing location\nbetween 47.5% - 52.5% minority and 47.5% - 52.5% non-minority. Id. at 16 (expressing this as a 3:1 ratio\nin family housing and a 1:1 ratio in elderly housing, with 2.5% variance in either direction). The record\nshows that, at best, five family locations and one elderly location are within these narrow bands. Doc. 266.\nHUD and LMHA have not moved the Court to modify or terminate the plan based on a theory that,\n2\n\nnotwithstanding the racial makeup being outside the bands, they have met the general objectives of the plan\nand are entitled to termination of the plan. See id. (“C. The Plan shall continue until its objectives are\nachieved.”). There is no value, then, in the Court making a concrete determination that HUD and LMHA\nhave not met the objectives of the plan, as Ms. Grayson requests. The inquiry turns entirely on whether Ms.\nGrayson can show that modification of the plan is appropriate because “progress is not being made toward\nachieving the objectives of the Plan.” Id.\nMs. Grayson asks the Court to create a new plan that encompasses LMHA’s handling of Section 8\nvoucher programs. During the last two decades, HUD has shifted to favoring Section 8 vouchers as the\nneed for public housing has increased and public housing agencies nationwide have demolished aging\npublic housing projects without replacing them, instead moving people into voucher-based housing.\nBecause of this, the nature of LMHA’s work has changed much since Ms. Grayson’s predecessor filed this\ncase in 1974. Yet Ms. Grayson’s request to include Section 8 administration in a revised AAP oversteps\nthis Court’s authority. The Court’s role is limited to enforcing federal law when it must and returning\nauthority to the locally accountable officials when it can. Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 450 (2009)\n(analyzing the Equal Education Opportunity Act and finding that institutional reform litigation must be\nflexible to account for changing circumstances, but must also be keen to respecting federalism concerns and\nthe ultimate goal of returning authority to the local governmental unit when the violation of federal law is\ncured); accord United States v. Tennessee, 615 F.3d 646, 652 (6th Cir. 2010) (“federal encroachment upon\nstates' rights is more likely to occur in institutional reform litigation [so,] courts must take a ‘flexible\napproach’ to Rule 60(b)(5) motions addressing such decrees.” (quotations omitted)). \nIn this case, the Court created the AAP because it found racial segregation in public housing\nprojects and created a judicial solution to remedy that. “The evidence in the case also is overwhelming that\nthe defendants, since the time of the Vann decision have, by selecting sites for new housing developments\neither in racially concentrated or racially impacted areas, or in census tracts on the fringes of those areas, or\n3\n\nthat were obviously changing from non-impacted to impacted, acted in a manner which totally belies their\ndeclaration of [non-segregation] policy.” Doc. 88 at 11-12. This Court and the Court of Appeals were\naware that LMHA administered Section 8 housing, but the ultimate AAP did not include a mandate\ndirecting LMHA’s Section 8 administration. Of course, the Court’s original injunction included a ban on\nengaging in any discriminatory housing practices, and this would include LMHA’s administration of\nSection 8 housing, but the AAP focuses exclusively on housing projects. The Court of Appeals explicitly\nstruck provisions of the District Court’s order that could have been broadly interpreted and left the more\nspecific foundation that became the AAP and controls public housing projects. See Doc. 117 at 41 (“We set\naside . . . the court’s injunction and direction for submission of affirmative action plans, except for Part IX\nand paragraph a. of part VI of the trial court’s judgment order and REMAND the cause for further\nproceedings in conformity with this opinion.”). This Court of Appeals’ remand led to the Court’s adoption\nof the AAP, and that did not include a mandate for administering Section 8 voucher programs. If Ms.\nGrayson could show (and she has not even asserted this) that LMHA was using Section 8 vouchers in a\nway that worsens the segregation in public housing projects, then the Court could consider broadening the\nAAP to prevent that. But, simply noting that the Section 8 program is itself a difficult program to\nadminister fairly does not broaden the Court’s power to include the administration of Section 8 housing in\nthe AAP. Except when a plaintiff shows a violation of federal law and the court remedies it with an order\n(see, e.g. Horne, 557 U.S. at 450 (“It goes without saying that federal courts must vigilantly enforce federal\nlaw and must not hesitate in awarding necessary relief.”)), comity and federalism demand that courts must\ndefer to local officials to implement programs that adhere to the law. Id. Therefore, the Court cannot grant\nMs. Grayson’s request to broaden the AAP to include LMHA’s administration of Section 8 vouchers.\nThe Court’s 1985 order implementing the AAP after remand from the Court of Appeals, 1985 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 12980 at 15-29, defines the Plan’s objectives in (I)(A) and (B). Succinctly, they are: (1) to\nreduce racial segregation in LMHA projects, (2) to remedy the effects of past discrimination, and (3) to\n4\n\nassure equal access to housing opportunity without regard to race, color, or national origin. The AAP\nallowed that the objective of remedying past discrimination would be achieved if all the housing projects\nwere within a narrow band of ratios between minority and non-minority residents (between 72.5% - 77.5%\nminority and 22.5% - 27.5% non-minority in family housing and between 47.5% - 52.5% minority and\n47.5% - 52.5% non-minority in elderly housing (expressed as ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 with plus or minus 2.5%\nconsidered on-target)). The first and second objectives merge in the plan; that is, the remedy for past\ndiscrimination that caused segregation is, under the plan, to reduce segregation going forward. The third\nobjective is sometimes in tension with the first two because LMHA must exert some influence on residents\nto get them to move in certain directions based on their race (to end up with evenly desegregated projects).\nThe AAP narrowly walks between these objectives, which are sometimes in tension, dictating how LMHA\ncan allocate its units.\nThe 1985 order provided for modification by agreement (and the parties are not in agreement) or\nmodification when any party can show that progress is no longer being made under the plan. Therefore, the\nCourt’s narrowly defined task is to determine if Ms. Grayson can show that progress is not being made\ntowards achieving these objectives. In support of her position, Ms. Grayson can show that the 3:1 ratio has\nnot been met in all the family housing and the 1:1 ratio has not been met in all the senior housing. She also\ncan show that many individual projects have had some, but not enough, progress towards desegregation.\nThe ratios (3:1 for family housing and 1:1 for elderly housing) are, to an extent, red herrings. The\nlanguage of the Court’s 1985 order (1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12980 at 16) allows that, “[t]he objective of\nremedying past discrimination shall be achieved and maintained so long as [the ratios are attained and\nmaintained].” Yet, remedying past discrimination is only one of three discernible objectives of the original\nplan, and this ratio language does not preclude meeting this objective or the other two objectives by other\nmeans. Most importantly, the stipulated facts show that the ratio of non-minorities in the LMHA system\nhas dropped; family housing is now around 21% non-minority and elderly housing is now around 39%\n5\n\nnon-minority. To compel LMHA to move towards 25% non-minority residents in every family housing\nproject and towards 50% non-minority residents in every elderly housing project may effect the precisely\nopposite outcome as is desired. Because the wording of the AAP does not strictly bind the Court to those\nratios and because the reality has changed, the Court will not require strict adherence to the outdated 3:1\nand 1:1 ratios.\nAs the Court seeks to determine whether progress is being made towards the plan’s objectives, it\nmust employ a method of measurement. Many ways of measuring desegregation success may exist, but two\nmeasures are worth noting. The first measure is ratios (although not the outdated ratios); in a perfectly\ndesegregated public housing system, the ratios in each location would be the same as the ratios in the\noverall system. That is, if non-minorities made up 20% of the residents in the overall system, then one view\nof desegregation would hold that each project would have 20% non-minority residents and 80% minority\nresidents. This method of measuring is reflected in the Court’s 1985 order noting that desegregation will be\nconsidered achieved when the ratios are 3:1 and 1:1 (the then-accurate reflection of the makeup of the\nLMHA population at large). Another measure is whether any applicant can live wherever he desires,\nwithout regard to his race. This, of course, is both a measure of desegregation and a worthy goal of\ndesegregation, but itself may lead to more segregation (that is, if individuals use their freedom to choose\nlocations where their own race predominates). Further, practicality hampers this method; in Lucas County,\nthere is an extensive waiting list for public housing. When a resident does not get into his desired location,\nit may be a reflection of that resident’s need for immediate housing more than a poor reflection on\ndesegregation efforts. For example, a minority applicant may not end up living in a predominantly non-\nminority location because his strong need for housing left him with no other choice than to take the first\navailable unit rather than waiting months or years for an opening in his desired location. This, then, reflects\nthe sad reality of a heavily burdened public housing system in general, not that system’s ability to\ndesegregate its properties.\n6\n\nBecause of the complex realities, the Court has not discovered – and the parties have not suggested\n– a better measuring device than examining the contrast between the overall ratios and the ratios in each\nlocation. This carries with it the risk that it could motivate LMHA to “teach to the test,” taking steps\nnecessary to bring the ratios in line at the expense of other objectives. Yet, as was the case in 1985 and is\nstill the case today, courts like tangible, quantifiable measuring tools and checking the ratios grants exactly\nthat. Even if ratios are a good measuring tool, the 1985 ratios (3:1 and 1:1) are no longer a fair measure of\nsuccess. The parties have stipulated that today family locations are 20.6% non-minority and elderly\nlocations are 29.1% non-minority. To grade LMHA on whether they met the long-outdated 3:1 and 1:1\nratios would be unfair and is not required by the text of the 1985 order for a number of reasons, including\nthe fact that LMHA is not asking the Court to deem the desegregation task complete.\nMs. Grayson lists four projects that were nearly all minority when they began and today remain\nbetween 88% and 95% minority. She says, “[t]he projects that LMHA built for black people are still the\nprojects for black people.” Doc. 269 at 8. LMHA notes that it is in the process of tearing down and\nrebuilding three of these four projects. Ms. Grayson also points to two other projects that began with\nlopsided ratios and have only made modest progress in the last 23 years. LMHA counters that it has made\nsignificant progress in moving ratios at many of its projects, including the six that Ms. Grayson uses to\nillustrate her point. Not achieving a perfect balance indicates desegregation is a task complicated by many\nrealities, LMHA says, and does not indicate that it is not making progress.\nSince Ms. Grayson has taken on the burden of showing that progress is not being made and is\nattempting to do so by sampling the changes in ratios in certain projects, and since LMHA is answering\nwith a different interpretation of the same data, the Court will analyze that data more thoroughly. If proper\ndesegregation is achieved by moving every project’s ratio towards the overall system’s ratio, then any\ngiven project is, by definition, more segregated the further it moves from the system-wide ratio. Tracking\nhow far each project is from desegregation is possible by measuring the difference between the system’s\n7\n\nratio (plus or minus 2.5%) and the project’s ratio. Using the data stipulated by the parties, each project’s\npoints away from the system-wide ratio can be calculated in 1989 and 2011:\nElderly Housing Projects\n1989 2011\nSystem-wide non-minority: System-wide non-minority:\n59.4%   (in 1983) 29.1%\nProject\nRange: 56.9 – 61.9 Range: 26.6 – 31.6\nPercent non- Points away Percent non- Points away\nminority from range minority from range\nHarry Hansen (007) 64.5 2.6 25.0 1.6\nSpeiker Terrace (009) 87.5 25.6 39.6 8\nVistula Manor (012) 55.3 1.6 27.0 0\nGlendale Terrace (013) 81.4 19.5 38.3 6.7\nOak Grove Elderly (014) 25.0 31.9 50.0 18.4\nRichmar Manor (015) 65.9 4 64.6 33\nParqwood Apartments (020) 9.3 47.6 11.3 15.3\nFlory Gardens (021) 27.3 29.6 24.4 2.2\nTeneyck Tower (030) 26.2 30.7 24.6 2\nRobert Dorrell (032) 65.0 3.1 44.0 12.4\nAshley Arms (038) 17.9 39 17.1 9.5\nTotal points away from range 235.2 109.1\n8\n\nFamily Housing Projects\n1989 2011\nSystem-wide non-minority: System-wide non-minority:\n21.2%   (in 1983) 20.6%\nProject\nRange: 18.7 – 23.7 Range: 18.1 – 23.1\nPercent non- Points away Percent non- Points away\nminority from range minority from range\nBrand Whitlock Ext (002) 3.6 15.1 4.4 13.7\nRavine Park Village (003) 17.3 1.4 35.4 12.3\nAlbertus Brown (004) 0 18.7 8.1 10\nPort Lawrence Homes (005) 0 18.7 11.8 6.3\nBirmingham Terrace (006) 18.5 0.2 34.5 11.4\nBrand Whitlock (008) 1.1 17.6 5.1 13\nPulley Homes (010) 4.5 14.2 28.9 5.8\nNorthern Heights 17 (017) 14.3 4.4 20.7 0\nNorthern Heights 19 (019) 6.7 12 9.1 9\nElmdale Courts (023) 17.9 0.8 20.6 0\nScattered Sites 28 (028) 0 18.7 17.4 0.7\nJohn Holland (031) 7.5 11.2 9.5 8.6\nOak Grove Rental (036) 3.3 15.4 45.8 22.7\nJade Estates (041) 17.0 1.7 19.1 0\nTurnkey County Willow Bend (044) 12.5 6.2 12.5 5.6\nWeiler Homes (001) 29.2 5.5 22.8 0\nDevonshire (042) 29.5 5.8 32.2 9.1\nMarsrow Acres (043) 33.3 9.6 40.0 16.9\nHouck Town Homes (049) No data No data 20.0 Not calculated\nMcClinton Nunn (011) 0.8 17.9 11.7 6.4\n201-Scattered Sites Zone 1 / \n8.3 10.4 0 18.1\n     Scattered Sites 233\n202-Scattered Sites Zone 2 / \n40.0 16.3 28.6 5.5\n     222 Scattered Sites\n203-Scattered Sites Zone 3 / \n40.0 16.3 14.3 3.8\n     223 Scattered Sites\n204-Scattered Sites Zone 4 / \n32.9 9.2 23.5 0.4\n     213 Scattered Sites\n205-Scattered Sites Zone 5 / \n31.1 7.4 25.8 2.7\n     211 Scattered Sites\n206-Scattered Sites Zone 6 / \nNo data No data 10.5 Not calculated\n     212 Scattered Sites\n206-Scattered Sites Zone 6 /\nNo data No data 12.5 Not calculated\n     213 Scattered Sites\nTotal points away from range 254.7 182.0\n9\n\nA sum of the points away from the system-wide ratio for both family housing and elderly housing\ndemonstrates that LMHA is making some progress towards desegregation (significant progress in elderly\nhousing, moderate progress in family housing). This has answered, in the negative, the question Ms.\nGrayson presented. That is, Ms. Grayson has not shown that progress is not being made towards\ndesegregation because the numbers show that between 1989 and 2011, LMHA made some progress. Some\nprogress is the opposite of no progress and no further analysis is needed of the stipulated data. Ms.\nGrayson’s motion to modify the AAP must be denied because she cannot meet the Court’s 1985 standard\nfor modification, namely, showing that progress toward the goal of desegregation is not being met.\nThe Court’s application of a specific mathematical formula used to analyze Ms. Grayson’s\ncontention that progress is not being made towards desegregation does not change the criteria established to\nalter the AAP. The criteria to modify the AAP in the future remains as the Court established it in 1985:\n“The Plan may be modified at any time by agreement of all the parties hereto, or when, upon motion of any\nparty at any time, it shall be made to appear that progress is not being made towards achieving the\nobjectives of the Plan.” 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12980 at 16. \nEven though Ms. Grayson has not carried the burden of showing progress is not being\nmade under the AAP, she has shown that the AAP is not well suited to contemporary realities. The\n3:1 and 1:1 ratios are long outdated. Furthermore, the practical application of waiting lists,\nresident preference, and LMHA’s shifting focus (to Section 8 and to rebuilding troubled projects)\nlikely means that LMHA could act in a completely fair, non-discriminatory, and non-\nsegregationist manner and still never reach the point where every project’s ratio was within 2.5%\nof the system-wide ratio. Most importantly, Ms. Grayson may soon be able to show LMHA’s\nprogress to be plateaued using the Court’s analysis and comparing more recent years rather than\nthe 22 year span the Court used based on the stipulated data. All this leaves the situation ripe for\nMs. Grayson and LMHA to collaborate on a revised AAP that addresses the need to continue the\n10\n\nhousing projects move toward desegregation while accounting for the modern realities and the\nexperience gained by implementing the AAP for more than two decades. If the parties consent, the\nCourt will assist in settlement negotiations.\nFor the reasons stated in this memorandum opinion, the plaintiffs’ motion to alter the\nAffirmative Action Plan (Doc. 231) is denied.\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n    s/ David A.

A hearing on the motion was  held March  31,  1975, \nwherein  the parties presented evidence by  testimony and  stipulation. \nPlaintiffs  in  this  class action suit1  seek  to  compel  the \ndefendant  Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority  (hereinafter TMHA)  and \nthe  individual defendants,  the director  of  TMHA  and  the board members \nof TMHA,  to  seek cooperation agreements  from  the Toledo  supurban com \nmunities  of Sylvania,  Maumee,  Oregon,  Ottawa Hills,  Holland,  Whitehouse, \nWaterville,  Berkey  and Harbor View.2  Plaintiffs allege in their  complaint \nthat TMHA  has  not  undertaken its affirmative duty  of placing housing  for \nlow-income  persons  outside  areas  of  racial and  low income  concentration. \nIt appears  that while TMHA  has  jurisdiction to  provide  l3o w-income  housing \nthroughout  all of  Lucas  County  except Harding Township, cooperation \nagreements  have only been  obtained  from  the City of  Toledo  and Lucas \nCounty. 4  Plaintiffs contend  that  the defendant Authority has  steadfastly \nrefused  to  seek cooperation agreements  from  the  suburban  communities \ndespite  repeated requests  to  do  so. \nThe  defendant Authority  argued  at the hearing  that  the  immediate \nproblem involved with  this motion  is the disposition of  120  family  units \nwhich are presently allocated for  development  in the City of Toledo  from \nthe Department  of  Housing  and Urban Development  (HUD).  TMHA  contends \nthat under  the United  States Housing  Act  of  1937,  42  U.S.C.  §1401  et ~·· \nas  amended  by Pub.  L.  No.  93-383  (August  22,  1974)(hereinafter Act), \nthe  allocation of  120  conventional housing  units will be  lost if con \nstruction of  the units does  not begin soon because of  a  change  in the \nscheme  of  assistance  for  low-income housing  contained  in the  1974  amendments \nto  the Act.

PageID #: 243\n- 2 -\npolicy is to  terminate any  existing contracts  for  the  construction of \nconventional low-income housing not  substantially underway  by  July 1, \n1975,  because of  the requirements  for  administering  the new  program \nof housing  assistance.  TMHA  argues  that  there  is a  present demonstrated \nneed  for public housing  in the City of Toledo,  with whom  it has  an \nexisting cooperation agreement,  which would not be  diminished by  the \nprobable loss of  the 120 units presently allocated.  TMHA  states  that \nthe  time  required to  prepare proposals  for  presentations  to  the sub \nurban communities  necessary for  securing  cooperation agreements would \nmake  it impossible  to  have  any  project involving  the 120  units under \nconstruction by  the July 1st deadline.  It is also  the position of \nTMHA  that BUD  officials have  informed  it that  cooperation agreements \nare not  required  for  new  §8  housing5  after July  1,  1975,  thus  it would \nbe a  futile  act  to  attempt  to  procure  the cooperation agreements  at  this \ntime. \nThe  Court  finds  that a  preliminary  injunction should not issue \nin this  case in its present posture.  The  purpose  of  a  preliminary \ninjunction is \nto  guard against a  change  in conditions which will hamper \noprr oppreerv aenftte  trh ea   gtrriaanlti nogf  othfe  s uiscshu rees.l ieIft sa s omrdayin  baery f ofuunndc tion \nis  to  preserve  the  status  quo  and  it is to  be  issued only \nupon  a  showing  that  there would otherwise be  danger  of \nirreparable injury.  United States v.  Adler's  Creamery, \n107  F.2d 987,  990  (2d  Cir.  1939). \nSee  also  C.  Wright  & A.  Miller,  Federal Practice and Procedure,  §2947  at \n423  (1973). \nIt has  not been demonstrated  from  the evidence adduced  at  the \nhearing on  the present motion  that there exist any  circumstances  that \nrequire this Court  to  exercise its extraordinary power  of  preliminary \ninjunction to preserve  the status quo.  It appears  that TMHA  is preparing \nto  advertise for  bids  for  the 120  units  under  the previously allocated HUD \nlow-income housing program.  Plaintiffs  contended  during  argument  that \nthe placement  of  120  units is the  last opportunity  for  requiring  dispersal \nof  low-income housing into Toledo's  suburbs.  The  Court  does  not  find \nthis argument  persuasive.  The  new  §8  housing provisions will provide \nopportunities for  dispersed housing  in the metropolitan suburbs.  The \nmain  change  occasioned by  the July 1  cut-off date will be  the  type ?f \nadministration of  the  low-income housing  assistance,  with an  e6m  phasis  of \nassistance coming  through  §8  rather  than  conventional housing. \n5.

PageID #: 244\n- 3  -\nThe  Court  finds  that the prospective  loss  of 120 units  to  the \nCity of  Toledo,  which has  an undisputed need  for  such low-income housing, \ngreatly outweighs  plaintiffs'  present need  for  injunctive relief which \nwould  effectively preclude TMHA  from  taking  the necessary actions  to \nsecure  the construction of  the 120  units  by July 1st.  Granting a  pre \nliminary  injunction as  requested would not maintain the  status quo  in \nthis case pending  a  hearing on  the merits,  but would effectively fore \nclose  the  construction of  the 120  units presently under reservation for \nthe City  of Toledo. \nThe  larger issue presented in the present case  is whether TMHA \nshould be required  to  take whatever  steps are necessary  to  insure that \nlow-income housing  is available  throughout  its entire jurisdictional area, \nwhich would  include  the  suburban areas  of  Toledo.  The  parties stipulated \ninto  evidence the record of Joseph Skillken & Co.  v.  City of  Toledo, \nCiv.  No.  74-202,  the memorandum  decision  of which is published in 380 F. \nSupp.  228  (N.D.  Ohio  1974).  The  evidence  submitted  in that case led this \nCourt  to  conclude  that the City of Toledo  is a  racially segregated city \nwith minority  groups  heavily  concentrated in limited parts of  the  city \nknown  as  the \"Southwest Corridor.\"  380  F.  Supp.  at  231.  TMHA  manages \napproximately 3,000  units  of public housing  in the  City of Toledo  and \n52  units  in Lucas  County.  Until very recently,  public housing projects \nwere placed  in areas  adjacent  to  already highly concentrated minority \nhousing,  further  adding  to  the  segregated housing pattern of Toledo. \nId.  Approximately  seventy percent of  the TMHA  family  public housing  is \noccupied by minorities.7  The waiting  list for  family  unit public \nhousing,  presently numbering  1,800  applicants,  is composed  of  seventy \npercent blacks  and Mexican-Americans.8  The  foregoing  facts  indicate  that \nany decision concerning the location of  low-income,  publicly assisted \n9 \nhousing has  a  disproportionate  impact  on minorities. If the  effect \nof  any  action or  inaction by TMHA  in the location of  low-income housing \nis to  exclude people from  certain areas  of Lucas  County,  such as  the \nsuburban  communities,  because of  their race,  then those actions must be \njustified by  some  compelling  governmental  interest.  In re Griffi~, \n413  U.S.  717  (1973);  Kramer  v.  Union Free School District,  395  U.S.  621 \n(1969);  Loving v.  Virginia,  388 U.S.  1  (1967);  McLaughlin v.=Flo~, \n379  U.S.  184  (1964).  That determination must  await  a  trial on  the merits. \n--------~-~-------------------------------\n7.  Deposition of Carl Barrett at 7-8. \n8.  Plaintiffs'  Complaint  at ,[20;  Defendants'  Answer  at ,[9. \n9.  Mr.  John Riordon  testified at the hearing  that HUD  recognizes  the \nadverse effect of  concentrating low-income housing  in areas  of  racial \nand  low-income  concentration and  has  set guidelines  for  site selection \nwhich requires  sites to be dispersed in suburbs  and  areas  away  from \nracial and  low-income concentration. \n\nCase: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 35  Filed:  04/09/75  4 of 6.  PageID #: 245\n- 4 ·-\nOn  the present record,  the Court  is not  prepared  to  order  the \nextraordinary remedy of  injunctive relief which would  require TMHA  to \nseek cooperation agreements with the  suburban cities and villages  sur \nrounding Toledo.  In the first place,  those municipalities  clearly cannot \nbe  compelled  to  enter  into  cooperation agreements.  Mahaley v.  Cu~oga \nMetropolitan !!_ousing Authority,  500  F.2d 1087  (6th Cir.  1974).  The \nassistance provided  to  communities  under  the Act  need not be accepted by \nthe local governments.  James  v.  Valtierra,  402  U.S.  137,  140  (1971). \nFurthermore,  the defendants have  contended  that cooperation \nagreements  are not  required by  the new  provisions of  the Act.  That  issue \nis far  from  clear.  A strict reading of  the new  provisions  of  the Act \nwould  compel a  contrary conclusion.  The  1974  amendment  provides  at \n§5  of Title II: \n(e).  In recognition  that  there should be  local determination \nof  the need  for  low-income housing  to meet  needs  not \nbeing adequately met by  private enterprise -\n*  *  * \n(2)  the Secretary shall not make  any  contract for \nloans.  •  •  or  for  annual  contributions pursuant \nto  this Act  unless  the governing body  of  the locality \ninvolved has  entered into  an agreement with  the \npublic housing agency  providing for  local cooperation \nrequired by  the Secretary pursuant  to  this Act. \nA literal reading  of  the statute would  thus  still require  cooperation \nagreements whenever  any  funds,  whether  for  loans  or  annual  contributions, \nare expended  under  the Act,  whether  for  §8  or other programs.  The \nlegislative history  indicates  that §5(e): \nWould  provide  that  the Secretary may  not  enter  into  a \ncontract with a  public housing agency  for preliminary  loans \nfor  surveys  and  planning  in respect  to  a  project unless  the \nlocal governing body  involved has  approved by resolution the \napplication of  the public housing agency  and  unless  the  public \nhousing agency has  demonstrated  that there  is a  need  for  the \nlow-income housing which  is not being met  by private enter \nprise.  This  subsection also would  provide  that the Secretary \nmay  not enter into a  contract for  loans  (other  than preliminary \nloans)  or  for  annual  contributions unless  the  governing body \nof  the locality has  entered  into an agreement with the public \nhousing  agency providing  for  the local  cooperation required \nby  the Secretary pursuant to  the Act.  S.  Rep.  93-693, \n93d  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  (1973);  U.S.  Co~e Cong.  & Ad.  News \n3893  (1974). \nHowever,  the  testimony of Mr.  Riordon,  acting area program \ncoordinator  for  HUD  whose  jurisdiction includes Lucas  County,  indicated \nthat HUD  officials do  not believe that cooperation agreements  are required \nfor  the housing  program specified in §8  of  the amended  Act.  This  con \nclusion does  not  seem to  square with the language of  §5(e)(2). \nThe  recent  amendments  of  the Act  also  provide at §213  that upon \nreceiving an application for housing assistance:under  the Act  and under \nstatutes,  the  Secretary must notify  the unit of  local government  involved \n\nCase: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 35  Filed:  04/09/75  5 of 6.  PageID #: 246\n- 5  -\nwithin ten days  and  give it an opportunity  to  respond  to  the application \n10 \nif the local government has  an  approved assistance plan.  This  notice \nmust be  given under  the  current regulations  applicable  to  the new  §8 \nhousing.11  It could be argued,  and  apparently HUD  officials are so  inter \npreting  the new  Act  and  regulations,  that the notice  provisions  supercede \nthe cooperation agreement  requirements  as  to  §8  housing. \nThe only  thing  clear at this point in the new  programs  of \nassistance for  low~income housing under  the Act,  including  §8  housing, \nis  that HUD  guidelines  require  the dispersal of publicly assisted \nhousing  out of  areas  of racial and  economic  concentration.  24  C.F.R. \n§1273.103(j),  39  Fed.  Reg.  45173  (Dec.  30,  1974).  The  Court  is likewise \ncommitted  to  the principle of  dispersal of  low-income housing  throughout \nthe full extent of TMHA's  jurisdiction,  including  the  communities \nsurrounding  the City of Toledo.  The  exact  degree of  local government \ninvolvement  in the determination of location of  the housing  is uncertain \nat this  time because of  the recent  changes  in the law and regulations \nthereunder.  Under  these circumstances,  the Court does  not believe that \nTMHA  should be required to  expend what may  be needless  time and money \nto  obtain cooperation agreements  from  the surrounding communities \nuntil it has  been clearly demonstrated  that such agreements  are required \nfor  the type of housing  funding  that will actually be  available to TMHA \nfor  utilization.  This  determination must wait  for  a  more  complete \nexposition by  the parties as  to  exactly what  the new HUD  programs \nwill means  as  to  the  dispersal of  low-income housing  in the Toledo  area. \nPlaintiffs'  motion  for  a  preliminary injunction will therefore be denied. \nIt seems  unfortunate  that while  this  case has  now  been pending \nfor  a  year,  the defendant  TMHA  does  not seem to have made  any  effort \nwhatever  even  to make  a  preliminary exploration of  the possibilities \nof  securing cooperation agreements with any  of  the local governments \nwithin its boundaries.  It was  clear from  the  evidence at the pre \nliminary injunction hearing  that obtaining such  agreements  would \nrequire preparation of  quite definite programs  to be  offered in areas \nwithin which a  cooperation agreement  is  sought.  Granted  that the \n10.

More  than \nhalf  of  the  two  hundred  plus  pages  of  post-trial  briefs  are \ndevoted  to  factual  analysis.

The  Court  has  no  doubt  that  the  evidence \nsupports  its  factual  conclusions  hereinafter  stated,  even \nthough  the  parties  will  disagree  with  many  of  them. \nThe  evidence  leaves  no  doubt  that  Toledo  and  Lucas \nCounty  are  marked  by  a  pervasive  pattern  of  housing \ndiscrimination  that  still persists  substantially  unchanged \nsince  housing  laws  first  began  to  develop  in  the  early \nnineteen-thirties.  Technically,  of  course,  housing \ndiscrimination  has  been  illegal  since  the  adoption  of \nThirteenth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments,  and  the  Civil Rights \nStatutes  enacted  shortly  thereafter. \nAt  the  time  of  the  1970  census,  four  years  before \nthis  action  was  commenced,  Lucas  County  had  484,370  residents. \n383,818,  or  79%  lived  in  the  City  of  Toledo.

An  area  of \nBlack  Impaction  is  one  in  which  the  percentage  of  black \nresidents  is  double  the  percentage  in  the  county  as  a  whole. \nAn  area  of  Minority  Concentration  is  one  with  more  than  twice \nthe  county-wide  percentage  of  black  residents;  more  than  three \ntimes  the  county-wide  percentage  of  residents  of  hispanic \nextraction,  or  both.  Areas  of  Minority  Concentration  have  more \nthan  22.6%  black  residents,  more  than  10%  residents  of  hispanic \norigin,  or  both.  Twenty  census  tracts  are  areas  of  Black \nImpaction,  and  thirty-five  census  tracts  are  areas  of  Minority \nConcentration.

Intentional \nracial  discrimination  over  a  long  period  of  time,  and \nunfortunately  still contin.uing,  has  played,  and  still plays,  a \nsignificant  role  in  the  concentration  of  minority  persons  in \nlimited  sections  of  Toledo  and  Lucas  County. \nThe  evidence  leaves  no  doubt  that positive  steps  must \nbe  taken  to  alter  the  existing  patterns  of  racial  segregation. \nIf  they  are  not,  the  present  patterns  will  be  those  of  the \nfuture.  Mrs.  Jaimes  and  Mr.  Gonzales  will  be  permanently \nexiled  from  the  places  that  are  home  to  them.

While  there  was  no  specific  evidence  as  to  the \neconomic  status  of  the  minority  residents  of  the  segregated \nareas,  it is  a  fair.inference  that  a  large  percentage  of  the \ndwellers  in  those  areas,  regardless  of  race,  fall  below  the \npoverty  level.  Although  much  of  the  argument,  particularly  on \nthe  part of  the  defendants,  totally  ignores  the  question  of \npoverty,  it is  entirely  clear  from  the  record  that  the \ndiscrimination  which  this  action  attacks  is  against  poor \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  09 5/12/83  9 of 25.

The  suburbs  are,  if \nanything,  more  hostile  to  the  poor  than  they  are  to  racial \nminorities. \nBasically,  the  plaintiffs  contend  that  the  defendants \nhave  failed  and  refused  to  do  that  which  the  law  requires  of \nthem  in  two  respects.  First,  to  develop  low-cost  housing \nopportunities  in  the  municipalities  and  unincorporated  areas  of \nLucas  County  outside  the  11Black  Corridor, ..  and  second  to \ndesegregate  the  housing  projects  which  are  owned  and  operated \nby  LMHA.  These  will  be  dealt with  in  reverse  order,  taking  up \nfirst  the  segregation  in  LMHA's  housing  facilities. \nWhen  TMHA  was  created  and  began  to  develop  housing \nprojects  where  there  had  been  slum clearance  activities,  it \nrelied  upon  the  now  discredited  11separate  but  equal11  doctrine \nto  preserve  the  racial  segregation  which  had  so  long  existed. \nFor  the  first  twenty  years  of  its  existence  LMHA  had  an  avowed \npolicy  of  racially  segregating  its housing  projects.  Of  its \nfirst  seven  projects,  four,  Brand  Whitlock  Homes,  Brand \nWhitlock  Extension,  Albertus  Brown  Homes,  and  Port  Lawrence \nHomes,  were  for  black  persons.  Three,  Weiler  Homes,  Ravine \nPark  Village,  and  Birmingham  Terrace,  were  for  white  persons. \nOn  January  8,  1953,  the  TMHA  Board  of  Commissioners \nordered  integration  of  its  housing  projects,  but  on  January  23, \n1953,  some  two  weeks  later,  the  Board  adopted  a  resolution \nwithholding  implementation  of  its  first  order. \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0150/1 2/83  10 of 25.

After  the  action was  filed,  on  April  28,  1953, \nthe  Board  adopted  a  resolution  repealing  the  January  8  and \nJanuary  23  resolutions,  and  adopted  \"a  policy  of \nnon-segregation,  commonly  known  as  integration,  in  the \noperation  and  management  of  all  its  low  cost housing  projects.\" \nThereafter  on  June  23,  1953,  Judge  Frank  L.  Kloeb, \nthen  the  Judge  of  this  Court,  ordered  that  the  defendant  carry \nout  its  resolution  within  four  months  from  the  date  of  the \nentry of  the  order  in  the  case.  Vann  v.  Toledo  Metropolitan \nHousing  Authority,  113  F.  Supp.  210  (N.D.  Ohio  1953). \nTwo  things  should  be  noted  about  this  decision.  The \nfirst  is  that  LMHA  had  to  be  forced  by  litigation  brought  by \nminority  individuals  to  develop  a  policy  of  desegregation,  and \nto  make  a  token  integration  of  its housing  projects.  The \nsecond  is  that  the  declaration  has  never  really  been  translated \ninto  action. \nThe  originally  segregated  housing  projects  have \nremained  essentially  as  they  were  to  begin  with.  In  part,  this \nhas  been  accomplished  by  a  device  known  as  \"freedom  of  choice.\" \nWhen  a  person  reaches  the  top  of  the  list of  applicants  for \npublic  housing,  he  is  offered  an  available  unit,  which  he  may \nreject  for  any  reason  or  no  reason.  He  is  then  offered \nanother,  which  again  he  may  arbitrarily  reject.  It is  only \nafter he  refuses  a  third  opportunity  that  he  loses  his  place \nand  is  forced  to  the  bottom  of  the  list. \n\nCase: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0151/ 12/83  11 of 25.  PageID #: 427\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \nIt is  of  course  well  understood  by  those  who  must \ndeal  with  problems  of  bigotry  and  discrimination  that  the  noble \nwords  \"freedom of  choice\"  often  are  a  euphemism  for  \"racism.\" \nIf  the  person  at  the  top  of  the  list of  housing  applications \nhad  to  accept  the  first available  unit physically  suitable  for \nhis  individual  needs,  or  else  be  dropped  to  the  bottom  of  the \nlist,  it is  inconceivable  that  after  some  twenty-five  years  the \nracial  complexion  of  LMHA's  old  housing  projects  would  not  at \nleast be  the  same  as  that  of  the  list of  housing  applicants,  if \nnot  of  the  community  as  a  whole. \nIn  the  case  of  Taylor  v.  Perini,  455  F.  Supp.  1241 \n(N.D.  Ohio  1978),  which  dealt with  the  problems  of  segregation \nin  the  Marion  Correctional  Institution of  the  State of  Ohio,  it \nwas  not  until  this  Court  rejected  a  petition  for  11freedom  of \nchoice\"  in  dormitory  arrangements,  signed  by  practically  all \nthe  inmates  and  staff  of  the  prison,  that desegregation  was \naccomplished.  Nor  did  the  disasters  predicted  develop.  There \nwere  neither  riots,  nor  individual  battles. \n11Freedom11  is  a  much  abused  word,  but  it is  clear  that \nthere  is  no  freedom  to  violate  the  law.  The  law  clearly  and \nunequivocally  forbids  discrimination.  Therefore,  no  one  is \n\"free\"  to  discriminate  against  others  on  a  basis  of  race, \ncreed,  sex,  age,  or  poverty. \nThe  evidence  in  the  case  also  is  overwhelming  that \nthe  defendants,  since  the  time  of  the  Vann  decision  have,  by \nselecting  sites  for  new  housing  developments  either  in  racially \n\nCase: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0152/1 2/83  12 of 25.

'8/82) \nconcentrated  or  racially  impacted  areas,  or  in  census  tracts  on \nthe  fringes  of  those  areas,  or  that were  obviously  changing \nfrom  non-impacted  to  impacted,  acted  in  a  manner  which  totally \nbelies  their  declaration  of  policy.  Another  method  of \nmaintaining  discrimination  used  by  the  defendants  is  the \nplacing  of  housing  projects  for  the  elderly  in  substantially \nall-white  census  tracts.  In  the  elderly  housing  projects \nconstructed  after  the  Vann  decision,  approximately  ninety \npercent  of  the  occupants  are  white. \nThe  same  is  true  of  the  leased  housing  developments. \nThe  defendant  HUD  did  not  set  rents  high  enough  to  obtain \nproperty  in  non-minority  tracts,  and  the  defendant  LMHA \nsupinely  accepted  these  unconscionably  low  rentals.  LMHA  only \nmade  one  effort over  the  years  to  get  higher  rents,  and  that \nwas  not  made  until  most  of  the  allotment  of  rental  units  had \nbeen  expended.  That  one  effort was  rejected  by  HUD. \nThe  program  which  offered  the  greatest opportunity  to \nbreaking  up  the  existing  problem  of  housing  segregation  was  the \nSection  8  Rent  Supplement  Program,  which  began  in  1974.  Under \nthis  program,  the  defendants  could  pay  the  difference  between \nthe  actual  rent  of  a  particular  housing  unit  and  the  rent  that \nthe  prospective  tenant  could  afford  to  pay.  In  theory,  this \nwould  enable  minority  poor  persons  to  rent  dwelling  units \nanywhere  in  the  metropolitan  area.  In  practice,  this  required \nvery  considerable  efforts  on  the  part of  LMHA  to  locate  rental \nunits,  and  to  counsel  and  assist housing  applicants  to  seek  out \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0153/1  2/83  13 of 25.  PageID #: 429\n(Rev. 8/82). \nunits  for  themselves,  and  to  understand  and  avoid \ndiscriminatory  treatment. \nThe  evidence  leave  no  doubt  that  LMHA  failed \nmiserably  to  do  what  it should  have  done.  It made  no \nconcentrated  efforts  to  locate  housing  units  in  areas  with  few \nor  no  minority  residents,  but  merely  took  whatever  came  along \nwithout  regard  to  location;  its  counselling  programs  were \ndevoted  only  to  the  mechanics  of  the  program.  One  counselor \nwent  so  far  as  to  tell applicants  that  if  they  encountered \nevidence  of  discrimination,  they  could  report  it to  the \ndefendants,  but  nothing  would  come  of  it.  This  was  in  spite of \nthe  fact  that  the  defendants  had  made  arrangements  with  the \nFair  Housing  Center  to  investigate  any  complaints  of \ndiscrimination  in  connection  with  the  program.  Housing \napplicants  were  not  instructed  to  bring  such  complaints  to  the \nFair Housing  Center,  or  how  to  go  about  doing  so.  In  fact,  not \na  single  complaint  was  ever  made  or  referred  to  the  Fair \nHousing  Center,  although  it is  inconceivable  that  no  housing \napplicant  seeking  to  take  advantage  of  the  Section  8  program \nexperienced  any  racial  discrimination. \nIt should  also  be  noted  that while  sites  were  at \nvarious  times  acquired  by  LMHA  which  could  have  been  developed \nto  provide  housing  in  areas  outside  the  black  impacted  and \nminority  concentrated  areas  of  Toledo,  several  of  these  were \nabandoned  without  reasonable  efforts  being  made  to  overcome \nobstacles  to  their  development. \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0154/1 2/83  14 of 25.  PageID #: 430\n(Rev.B/82) \n'  .  . \nIn  the  case  of  the  Lehman  Road,  Gawil,  Elmdale,  and \nSouth  and  Dale  sites,  LMHA  invited  litigation which,  while  it \nultimately  resulted  in  housing  construction  on  the  sites,  by \nthe  long  delays  involved,  by  reason  of  inflation,  cost  the  loss \nof  55  out  of  a  projected  400  units. \nAt  the  time  of  the  trial  of  this  case,  the  defendants \nabandoned  three  locations,  Talmadge  and  Laskey  Road,  Mellwood \nCourt,  and  Rambo  Lane.  These  sites  were  all  in  white \nmiddle-class  neighborhoods  of  the  City  of  Toledo.  While  there \nwas  some  claim  that  the  defendants  were  \"precluded\"  from  using \nthe  Talmadge-Laskey  and  Mellwood  sites,  no  excuse  or  reason  was \never  given  for  abandoning  the  Rambo  site.  The  conclusion  most \nfavorable  to  the  defendants  that  could  be  drawn  from  these \nfacts  is  that  they  were  not  aggressive  in  attacking \ndiscrimination.  This  Court  is  not  willing  to  draw  that \nconclusion.  The  whole  function  of  the  defendants  under  the  law \nis  to  provide  housing  for  the  poor  and  disadvantaged.  Their \nfailure  to  do  what  the  law  requires  is  tantamount  to  willful \ndiscrimination.  The  Court  finds  their  failure  to  disturb  the \nstatus  quo  over  a  long  period  of  years  deprived  the  members  of \nplaintiff  class  of  their  rights  under  the  Constitution  and  laws \nto  safe,  sanitary,  and  decent  housing.  It begs  the  question  to \nargue  that  plaintiffs  are  not  entitled  to  housing  in  any \nparticular  place.  The  only  place  it is  readily  available  is  in \nthe  suburbs.  Why  else  do  white  people  with  money  move  to  the \nsuburbs?  If all are  to  be  treated  equally,  the  plaintiffs  are \nentitled  to  do  what  the  majority  does--move  to  the  suburbs. \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0155/1 2/83  15 of 25.  PageID #: 431\n(~GV •. ~/82). \nThe  net  result of  all  this  is  that  the  defendants' \nactions  totally  belie  their  words.  LMHA's  declaration  of  a \npolicy  of  integration  has,  over  a  period  of  a  quarter  of  a \ncentury  from  the  Vann  decision  to  the  trial of  this  case,  left \nits  housing  as  segregated  as  it was  to  begin  with.  Nor  can  HUD \nescape  responsibility  for  LMHA's  actions.  It has  at  least as \ngreat  a  duty  to  carry  out  the  law  as  LMHA,  and  by  its  control \nof  the  purse  strings,  could  force  LMHA  to  dance  to  its tune. \nFurthermore,  it has  direct  responsibility  for  its  refusal  to \ngrant  LMHA's  request  for  a  realistic  scale  of  rent allowances \nunder  the  Section  8  program.  The  evidence  is  undisputed  that \nthe  prices  HUD  fixed  were  too  low  to  secure  desirable  rental \nproperties  from  private  landlords. \nTurning  now  to  the  other  basic  issue  in  the  case, \nthat  of  the  failure  and  refusal  to  develop  low-cost  housing \nopportunities  in  the  municipalities  and  unincorporated  areas  of \nLucas  County  outside  the  \"black  corridor,\"  both  the  factual  and \nlegal  issues  are  much  more  difficult of  resolution.  This  is \nthe  part of  the  action  of  most  concern  to  the  plaintiffs  Jaimes \nand  Gonzales  and  those  members  of  the  class  similarly  situated. \nExcept  for  the  Section  8  rent  subsidy  program,  in \norder  for  the  defendants  to  develop  housing  in  the \nmunicipalities  and  unincorporated  areas  of  Lucas  County  outside \nof  the  City  of  Toledo,  it is  necessary  to  have  cooperation \nagreements  entered  into  between  LMHA  and  the  particular \ngovernmental  entity  involved. \n\nCase: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0156/1  2/83  16 of 25.  PageID #: 432\nA072A \n(Rev.'B/82) \nSo  far  as  the  unincorporated  areas  of  Lucas  County \nare  concerned,  there  is  no  serious  problem  legally  in  this \nregard,  for  LMHA  did  succeed  in  negotiating  a  cooperation \nagreement  with  Lucas  County  for  100  units  of  housing.  However, \nall of  the  housing  developed  under  that  agreement  was  placed  in \nthe  Spencer-Sharples  area,  which  is  a  westward  extension  of  the \nblack  corridor,  and  the  one  black  impacted  census  tract  in  the \nunincorporated  area  of  the  county.  This  also  happens  to  be  an \narea  which  is  very  rural  and  plagued  with  poor  transportation \nwhich  limits  access  to  employment  and  shopping  facilities. \nHUD  is  equally  responsible  for  LMHA's  problems  in \nthis  particular  area,  for  at  time  of  trial  it held  title to  the \n46  rental  units  of  the  Bethany  project.  It was  then  seeking  to \ncoerce  LMHA  into  purchasing  these  units,  which  if  it were  done \nwould  substantially  exhaust  LMHA's  cooperation  agreement  with \nLucas  County. \nThe  defendants  claim  that  they  cannot  force \nmunicipalities  to  enter  into  cooperation  agreements,  and  that \npeople  have  no  constitutional  right  to  live  in  any  particular \nlocation,  relying  on  Lindsey  v.  Normet,  405  U.S.  56  (1972); \nJames  v.

They  also \nargue  that  there  are  substantially  more  white  persons  than \nminority  persons  on  LMHA's  waiting  list for  housing,  so  that  no \nracial  discrimination  is  really  involved  in  this  case. \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0157/1 2/83  17 of 25.  PageID #: 433\n(Rev. 8/82) \nThe  definition  of  the  class  definitely  makes  this \naction  one  involving  racial  discrimination,  but  it is  difficult \nto  twist  the  defendants'  adherence  to  the  Puritan  ethic  which \nequates  poverty with  sin  into  any  sort of  virtue.  Surely  to \ndiscriminate  against  the  poor,  regardless  of  race,  is  abhorrent \nto  the  constitutional  requirement  of  equal  protection.  As \nJustice  Marshall  says  in  James, \n\"It is  far  too  late  in  the  day  to  contend \nthat  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibits \nonly  racial  discrimination~ ••.. \" \n402  U.S.  at  145  (Marshall,  J.,  dissenting}.  From  the  time  of \nMagna  Carta,  judges  have  taken  oaths  not  to  discriminate  in \njudgment  between  rich  and  poor.  Should  the  other  branches  of \nthe  government,  or  even  the  people  themselves,  be  subject  to  a \ndifferent  rule? \nThis  is  perhaps  beside  the  point,  but  a  showing  that \ndiscrimination  is  broader  or  more  prevalent  than  the  plaintiffs \ncontend  does  not  support  a  very  strong  argument  that  they  have \nfailed  in  their  proof. \nGranted  that  the  defendants  cannot  compel  the  various \nmunicipalities  outside  of  Toledo  to  execute  cooperation \nagreements  or  to  accept  low-cost  housing  projects,  the  evidence \nshows  no  reason  that  they  cannot  cajole  them.  Admittedly,  the \ndefendants  made  no  real  effort  to  obtain  cooperation  agreements \nQuite  the  contrary,  the  one  attempt  they  made  was  an  arrogant \ncircular  letter  of  invitation which  both  in  form  and  in \nsubstance  invited  rejection.  This  is  alluded  to  in  the  Court's \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0158/1 2/83  18 of 25.  PageID #: 434\n(Rev. 8/82). \nearlier  memorandum  filed  January  14,  1977,  denying  the  federal \ndefendants'  motion  to  dismiss  the  complaint.  What  is  said \nthere  will  not  be  repeated  here. \nDefendants  seek  to  excuse  their  refusal  to  make  any \nreal  effort  to  obtain  cooperation  agreements  by  saying  that  it \nrequires  a  great deal  of  work  to  develop  such  agreements,  and \nLMHA's  staff  is  too  small  and  too  busy  to  undertake  the  burden. \nThey  also  assert  that  there  is more  need  for  housing  in  the \nCity  of  Toledo  than  LMHA  can  meet,  and  that  the  surburban \ncommunities  have  no  need  for  such  housing. \nPutting  aside  the  obvious  response  that  the  fact  that \nmany  people  in  Toledo  need  housing  does  not  mean  that  they  must \nbe  jammed  into  the  same  old  slums  in  the  central  city when \nthere  is  much  more  open  space  in  the  suburbs,  essentially  these \narguments  involve  the  old  device  of  taking  the  bundle  apart  and \nthen  easily  breaking  each  stick.  The  basic  fallacy,  and  the \nbasic  wrong,  is  that  they  maintain  the  ghetto  for  the \nminorities,  the  poor,  and  the  unfortunate.  Of  course  it might \nseem  that  the  suburbs  have  no  need  for  low-cost  housing, \nbecause  minorities  and  the  poor  have  been  systematically \nexcluded  from  them.  Their  residents  do  not  have  to  bear  the \nheavier  burden  of  expanding  municipal  services  and  facilities \nto  meet  the  needs  of  a  large  population,  because  they  exclude \nthe  less  fortunate.  It is  a  vicious  circle  of  the  poor  getting \npoorer  and  the  rich  getting  richer. \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0159/1  2/83  19 of 25.  PageID #: 435\n(Rev. 8/82) \nThe  evidence  in  the  case,  taken  as  a  whole,  leaves  no \ndoubt  that  the  needs  of  the  members  of  the  plaintiff  class  for \ndecent,  safe,  and  sanitary  housing  can  only  be  met  by \ndeveloping  such  housing  in  the  municipalities  in  Lucas  County \noutside  the  City  of  Toledo,  and  that  the  defendants, \nindividually  and  collectively,  have  failed  and  refused  to  take \nactions  that  could  eliminate  the  old  pattern  of  discrimination. \nRather,  they  have  intentionally made  the  choices,  and  acted  in \nthe  ways,  that  continue  to  discriminate. \nThe  Court  is  convinced  that Mrs.  Jaimes  and \nMr.  Gonzales  are  not  the  only  two  poor,  minority,  individuals \nwho  want  to  make  their  homes  in  the  suburbs  of  Toledo,  but \ncannot  do  so  because  of  entrenched  patterns  of  discrimination, \nhostility  and  greed.  The  members  of  the  class  are  entitled  to \nrelief  in  this  action. \nThe  problems  of  framing  appropriate  relief  in  this \naction  are  not  simple.  The  surburban  municipalities  which  are \nso  much  a  part of  the  discriminatory  actions  involved  in  this \ncase  are  not  parties  to  it,  nor  would  it be  appropriate  to  try \nto  bring  them  into  the  case  at  this  stage  of  the  proceedings. \nIt may  well  be  that  actions  will  ultimately  have  to  be  taken \neither  by  members  of  the  class  of  plaintiffs,  the  defendants, \nor,  preferrably,  both,  to  force  the  surburban  municipalities  to \nmeet  their  responsibilities.  Such  actions,  properly  framed  and \nprosecuted,  should  be  successful.  It cannot  be  that  these \nmunicipalities  can  become  walled  fortresses  impenetrable  to \nminorities  and  the  poor. \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0250/1  2/83  20 of 25.  PageID #: 436\n(Rev.8/82) \nEven  though  the  Court  cannot,  in  framing  relief,  make \ndirect orders  against  these  municipalities  or  their  officials, \nand  will  not  attempt  to  do  so,  the  plaintiffs  are  no  less \nentitled  to  relief  to  the  extent  that  the  Court  can  frame  it. \nThe  plaintiffs'  prayer  for  relief  is  elaborate. \nBasically,  they  ask  that  the  defendants  be  enjoined  from  doing, \nor  continuing  to  do,  any  acts  which  have  the  effect of  denying \nequal  housing  opportunities  or  the  lawful  implementation  of \nfederal  housing  programs;  that  the  defendants  be  required  to \nprepare  and  submit  for  Court  approval  a  plan  of  affirmative \naction  which  will  insure  dispersal  of  LMHA  units  outside  of \nareas  of  minority  concentration  and  into  the  municipal \ncorporations  in  Lucas  County  outside  the City  of  Toledo;  that \nthe  defendants  be  required  to  seek  cooperation  agreements  with \nsuch  municipal  corporations  for  the  location  of  low-cost  and \nminority  housing  therein;  requiring  the  defendants  to  prepare \nand  submit  a  plan  of  affirmative  action  which  will  insure  the \nreduction  of  racial  segregation  within  existing  LMHA  projects; \nan  award  of  damages,  both  compensatory  and  punitive,  to  the \nplaintiffs;  and  an  award  of  plaintiffs'  attorneys  fees,  costs, \nand  expenses  in  the  prosecution  of  this  action. \nIt is  clear  that  the  actions  of  the  defendants  have \nirreparably  injured  the  rights  of  the  plaintiffs  and  their \nclass.  Only  by  the  use  of  the  Court's  equitable  power  can  the \nwrongful  activities  of  the  defendants  be  terminated.  However \ncomfortable  the  majority  may  be  with  the  status  quo  in  the \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0251/1  2/83  21 of 25.

Later,  they \nwere  called  \"exemplary\"  damages,  as  the  purpose  was  to  deter \nothers  who  might  be  tempted  to  commit  wrongful  acts  by  the \nexample  of  the  punishment  visited  upon  the  defendant.

PageID #: 440\n(Rev.3/82) \nin  which  a  high  level  of  intentional maliciousness  is  clearly \npresent.  More  recently,  the  emphasis  seems  to  have  shifted \nfrom  personal  malice  to  a  perhaps  quite  impersonal  willfulness. \nObviously,  in  the  present  case  it is  difficult  to  find  any \npersonal  malice  against  the  plaintiffs  or  their  class  on  the \npart of  the  defendants.  However,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the \ndefendants'  conduct  was  willful.  All  of  them,  both  individual \nand  corporate,  knew  what  they  were  doing,  and  basically  knew  it \nwas  wrong,  even  though  they  were  only  doing  or  continuing  to  do \nwhat  had  always  been  done,  in  spite  of  the  efforts  of  the \nlegislatures  to  change  it.  Thus,  there  is  willfulness  present, \nand  there  should  be  some  deterrent  effect  if exemplary  damages \nare  granted.  In  those  areas  of  the  law,  patent  and  anti-trust, \nfor  example,  where  willfulness  statutorily  requires  the \nimposition  of  punitive  damages,  the  amount  of  such  damages  is \nfixed  at double  the  amount  of  the  actual  damages.  The  Court \nwill,  therefore,  award  each  of  the  plaintiffs  Jaimes  and \nGonzales  the  sum  of  Fourteen  Thousand  Four  Hundred  Dollars \n($14,400.00)  and  the  plaintiff  Tarrie  the  sum  of  Twelve \nThousand  Dollars.

If  the  parties  are  unable  to  agree \nupon  the  amount,  upon  application,  the  matter  will  be  set  for \nhearing  to  enable  the  Court  to  fix  the  amount. \n\nA072A  Case: 3:74-cv-00068-DAK  Doc #: 87  Filed:  0255/1 2/83  25 of 25.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nWESTERN DIVISION\nJOSIE JAIMES, \nPlaintiff, Case No. 3:74 CV 68\n-vs-\nMEMORANDUM   OPINION\nTOLEDO METROPOLITAN\nHOUSING AUTHORITY, et al., \nDefendant.\nKATZ, J.\nThis matter is before the Court on the Motion for Relief (Doc. No. 247) of the Defendant\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).  The Court notes federal question\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1331  and proper venue under 28 U.S.C. §1391.  For the reasons\nstated below, HUD’s motion will be denied\nI. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit in 1974.  The four named plaintiffs originally\nclaimed racial discrimination against the Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority in the provision\nof housing assistance in Lucas County, specifically segregation.  Following certification of the\nclass Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add HUD as a defendant.  The Toledo Metropolitan\nHousing Authority has since been replaced by the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority\n(“LMHA”), which continues as a defendant in the case.1\n1\nThe Complaint and Amended Complaint also included several individuals.  They have never been\nseparately represented and any relief sought has been inseparable from the institutional relief\nsought.  Therefore, the Court will not refer to these individual Defendants separately from the\norganization (HUD and LMHA) with which they are affiliated.\n\nFollowing a trial, the Court found Defendants liable for racial segregation.  The Sixth\nCircuit affirmed this finding and the need for a corrective plan, though it rejected certain other\nfindings and remedies no longer at issue.  Jaimes v. Toledo Metro. Hous. Auth., 758 F.2d 1086\n(6th Cir. 1985) (“Jaimes I”).  When Defendants appealed from the Affirmative Action Plan (the\n“Plan”) formulated by the Court, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the Plan, with some adjustments, but\nremanded for specific findings on the extent of HUD’s liability.  Jaimes v. Toledo Metro. Hous.\nAuth., 833 F.2d 1203 (6th Cir. 1987) (“Jaimes II”).  After amending the Plan in response to Jaimes\nII (Doc. No. 167), the Court specifically found that HUD was liable and subject to the Plan. \nJaimes v. Toledo Metro. Hous. Auth., 715 F.Supp. 835 (N.D. Ohio 1989) (“Jaimes III”).  HUD\ndropped its appeal from Jaimes III.\nIn 2011, after the Plan had operated for over twenty years, Plaintiffs moved to amend it. \nDoc. No. 231.  The parties then filed a stipulated plan, which the Court adopted, for consideration\nof three threshold issues before Plaintiff’s motion can be addressed.  The three issues are the effect\nof an order this Court issued on August 28, 2000 (Doc. No. 239), the effect of Norton v. Southern\nUtah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55 (2004) (“SUWA”) on waiver of sovereign immunity under\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and the effect of changed circumstances on the named\nplaintiffs’ ability to maintain this action.  HUD incorporated these three issues into its motion.\nII. STANDARDS\nThough HUD did not mention FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b) (“Rule 60(b)”) until its reply (Doc.\nNo. 255), the Court has determined that Rule 60(b) provides the appropriate standards for\naddressing all of the arguments related to the APA and SUWA, rather than law of the case and res\njudicata.  HUD invokes Rule 60(b)(4-6) which states “the court may relieve a party or its legal\n2\n\nrepresentative from a final judgment, order or proceeding for the following reasons ... (4) the\njudgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied ... or applying it prospectively is no longer\nequitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief.”  As the movant, HUD bears the burden of\ndemonstrating that Rule 60(b) applies.  In re G.A.D., Inc., 340 F.3d 331, 334 (6th Cir. 2003)\n(citing Smith v. Kincaid, 249 F.2d 243, 245 (6th Cir. 1957)).\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. The August 28, 2000 Order\nHUD, alluding to Rule 60(b)(5), first asserts that this Court found that the goals of the Plan\nhad been satisfied by stating that the situation demonstrated in “the 2000 Annual Review of Racial\nComposition of LMHA Housing comports with the objectives for racial composition ... decreed by\nprevious order of this Court.”  Doc. No. 239.  HUD attempts to shoehorn this language into the\nPlan term stating that it “shall continue until the court finds that its goal has been accomplished or\nupon a motion of either party followed by a hearing on the issue.”  Doc. No. 167 at 7 (applying\nJaimes II, 833 F.2d at 1207).  Rather than stating that those goals had been “accomplished,”\nthereby terminating the Plan through satisfaction, the Court was merely noting that Defendants\nwere complying with the Plan and moving toward satisfaction as of the 2000 Annual Review. \nEven now, over a decade after the order HUD claims found satisfaction under the Plan, the Court\nhas yet to find that the goals of the Plan have been accomplished.\nB. Effects of the SUWA Decision\nThe gist of HUD’s arguments concerning the effect of SUWA is that Plaintiffs would no\nlonger satisfy an exception to HUD’s sovereign immunity and so HUD should be released from a\njudgment entered at a time when Plaintiffs clearly satisfied the exception.  Not only does HUD fail\n3\n\nto show that the change in law justifies relief from judgment, but it has not even shown that\nPlaintiffs would no longer be able to satisfy the exception to sovereign immunity following\nSUWA.\nFirst, HUD notes that it could obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(4) if the judgment is void\nbecause “the rendering court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.”  G.A.D., 340 F.3d at 335 (citing\nAntoine v. Atlas Turner, Inc., 66 F.3d 105, 108 (6th Cir. 1995)).  However, such “a Rule 60(b)(4)\nmotion will succeed only if the lack of subject matter jurisdiction was so glaring as to constitute ‘a\ntotal want of jurisdiction,’ or ‘no arguable basis’ for jurisdiction existed.”  Id. at 336 (quotations\nomitted).  HUD does not argue that the Court did not have jurisdiction when it adopted the Plan or\nentered the Jaimes III decision.  Further, by focusing on SUWA, HUD essentially admits that the\nCourt did have jurisdiction, especially when coupled with HUD’s abandoned appeal.  Even if the\nSupreme Court in SUWA stated that its 2004 holding related to matters decided in 1989 and\nearlier, HUD cannot show that the Court, at the time it rendered its decisions, in 1989 and earlier,\ndid not have an arguable basis for jurisdiction because of a holding fifteen years in the future. \nThus, HUD is not relieved from the Plan due to voidness of the judgment.\nSecond, HUD claims that because of a change in law, SUWA, the Plan cannot be equitably\napplied to HUD prospectively under Rule 60(b)(5).  In such a motion, “a party can ask a court to\nmodify or vacate a judgment or order if ‘a significant change either in factual conditions or in law’\nrenders continued enforcement ‘detrimental to the public interest.’” Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S.\n433, 129 S.Ct. 2579, 2593 (2009) (quoting Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367,\n384 (1992)).  HUD clearly notes that it thinks that SUWA is an appropriate change in law, but\nnever actually mentions anything “detrimental to the public interest.”  At best, this leaves the\n4\n\nCourt to consider the public interest in the funds HUD must expend under the Plan.  However,\neven considering that factor, there is insufficient detriment to compare to the “compelling\ngovernmental interest” of “[r]emedying the manifestations of past discrimination.”  Jaimes II, 833\nF.2d at 1207.  Without showing a detriment to the public interest, HUD’s arguments concerning a\nchange in law fail to demonstrate sufficient reason to relieve it from judgment under Rule\n60(b)(5).\nThird, HUD invokes the catch-all provision, Rule 60(b)(6), reiterating its sovereign\nimmunity argument.  However, Rule 60(b)(6) has an “additional requirement that ‘something\nmore’ than one of the grounds contained in subsections (1) through (5) be shown for relief under\nthis section.”  East Brooks Books, Inc. v. City of Memphis, 633 F.3d 459, 465 (6th Cir. 2011)\n(citing Hopper v. Euclid Manor Nursing Home, Inc., 867 F.2d 291, 294 (6th Cir. 1989)).  Rather\nthan mention “something more,” HUD only notes that which it noted above under Rule 60(b)(4-\n5).  Thus, HUD is not entitled to relief from the Plan under Rule 60(b)(6).\nBecause HUD’s Rule 60(b) arguments fail, it has not shown the right to argue the effect of\nSUWA on the application of the APA in this case.  However, even if HUD could argue this issue,\nits arguments fail.  HUD accurately notes that in the Supreme Court narrowed the exception to\nsovereign immunity based on 5 U.S.C. §706(1) (“§706(1)”) (action to “compel agency action\nunlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed”) to suits “where a plaintiff asserts that an agency\nfailed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.” SUWA, 542 U.S. at 64 (emphasis\nin original).  However, SUWA does not effect 5 U.S.C. §706(2) (§706(2)”) (action to “hold\nunlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions”).\n5\n\nHUD claims that this case involves only §706(1) because it was ordered to do something,\nrather than stop doing something.  This argument confuses the difference between a claim and a\nremedy and ignores the language of the decisions in this case and the Amended Complaint.  See\ne.g. Jaimes I, 758 F.2d at 1091, 1094, 1100 (“that LMHA and HUD intentionally placed the\nhousing projects discussed in minority areas of the City of Toledo;” “Plaintiffs' first and major\ncontention is that LMHA and HUD have restricted public housing to the City of Toledo;” and\n“Plaintiffs challenge directly the actions of HUD in setting rentals too low to foster adequate\nhousing outside Toledo”); Jaimes III, 715 F.Supp. at 840-41 (“HUD is accused of more than\ninactivity or refusal to disturb the status quo ... HUD may not expend federal funds in a manner\nthat promotes or fails to deter discrimination in public housing ... HUD authorizes local housing\nauthorities to use the ‘three refusal’ policy”); Doc. No. 48 at IX(c) (seeking to enjoin HUD from\ndiscriminating).  \nHUD then notes that the Court in Jaimes III, though it discussed both §706(1) and §706(2),\ndid not state which provision it applied.  HUD claims this is an ambiguity that needs to be\nresolved, ignoring the possibility that the Court could have applied both, which this Court finds it\ndid.  Further, HUD attempts to resolve the ambiguity by asserting that the only remedy under\n§706(2) is a remand to the agency.  However, HUD’s authority for this position does not support\nthat claim.  First, HUD cites Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985), but\nomits the beginning of the sentence cited.  Read completely, the statement refers only to a\nsituation regarding an incomplete agency record, not the situation at issue here.  HUD’s other case\nmerely quotes Florida Power, including the qualifier HUD omitted.  Safe Extensions, Inc. v.\nF.A.A., 509 F.3d 593, 599 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  Also, there is authority holding that §706(2) can\n6\n\napply in this type of scenario.  N.A.A.C.P. v. Sec’y of Hous. & Urban Dev., 817 F.2d 149, 160 (1st\nCir. 1987).  HUD dismisses that case by claiming that it was overruled by SUWA, but ignores the\nalternate holding under §706(2); SUWA, unlike N.A.A.C.P., involved only §706(1) and not\n§706(2) as well.  Thus, even if the Court considered HUD’s arguments regarding the holding in\nSUWA, HUD has not shown that there would be no applicable waiver of sovereign immunity.\nIn addition, HUD presents other APA arguments not related to SUWA.  However, HUD\nexplicitly limits those arguments to only one of the bases for liability (Title VI) found in Jaimes\nIII and does not discuss the effect of failure of those claims if other claims (Title VIII) survive. \nSince HUD has presented no relief available under these arguments, the Court will not consider\nthem.  \nHUD has failed to qualify for relief from judgment because of SUWA under Rule 60(b). \nThus, the Court will deny its motion with regard to that ground.\nC. Standing of Named Plaintiffs\nThe third threshold issue the parties raised is the continued standing of the named\nplaintiffs. Doc. No. 245.  HUD notes that none of the four original named plaintiffs remain in the\nLMHA public housing system, rendering their claims moot.2  However, “[o]nce a class is\ncertified, the mooting of the named plaintiff's claim does not moot the action, the court continues\nto have jurisdiction to hear the merits of the action if a controversy between any class member and\nthe defendant exists.”  Brunet v. City of Columbus, 1 F.3d 390, 399 (6th Cir. 1993) (citing Sosna v.\nIowa, 419 U.S. 393, 399 (1975) (emphasis in original).  Not only has the class of Plaintiffs been\n2\nThe parties discuss the issue in terms of standing, but the presence of a live controversy is more\naccurately described as mootness.  The distinction is inconsequential here.\n7\n\ncertified for decades, but also HUD admits that it has not challenged the class, at least for the\nmoment.  Doc. No. 255 at 16n5.  Further, Plaintiffs’ class counsel offered to substitute named\nplaintiffs in response to the concern.  Thus, the Court will allow for the substitution of the named\nplaintiffs before proceedings continue with regard to Plaintiffs’ motion to modify.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed herein, Defendant HUD’s Motion for Relief from affirmative\naction plan and to dismiss claims (Doc. No. 247) is denied. \n    S/ David A. Katz         \nDAVID A.

      "text": "James v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority\nP H-OH-001 -002  1= -; _ 'T;  O\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ]±'-' • — ' *\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO  ~\nWESTERN DIVISION\nJosie Jaimes, et al., Case No. C 74-68\nPlaintiffs,\nvs.\nLucas Metropolitan Housing MEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nAuthority, et al.,\nDefendants.\nYOUNG, J:\nIn paragraphs VII, VIII, and IX of its original order\nin this case, filed on June 8, 1983 t\"June Order\"], this  Court\nordered the defendant to submit certain plans for action within\nsixty (60) days after the entry of the Order.  In paragraph X\nof the June Order, the plaintiffs were given thirty (30) days\nto respond  to  the  defendants' plans,  and  if  plaintiffs\nobjected, the Court was to hold a hearing to approve acceptable\nplans.  Such a hearing was in fact held on April 2 and 3, 1984,\nand thereafter  the parties filed written arguments in support\nof their respective positions.\nThis procedure was unique, so far as this Court is\nconcerned.  Its normal practice, when the parties cannot agree\nupon an entry, is to consider the forms of entry proposed, and\nthen make its order without further hearing.  A hearing  having\nbeen had, it seems  reasonable that the Court should make its\nfindings and conclusions, pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nRules  of  Civil  Procedure,  and  not  simply  let  the  matter  lie  in\n1imbo.\nHowever,  by  the  time  the  conflicting  proposals  were\nfiled  and  the  hearing  had,  the  Court's  judgment  had  been\nappealed  to  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Sixth  Circuit.  This\nraised  a question  as  to  this  Court's  jurisdiction  to  take  any\naction  so  long  as  the  case  remained  pending  on appeal.\nOn March 25,  1985,  the  Courtof  Appeals  decided  the\ncase  and  filed  its  opinion,  reversing  this  Court's  judgment  in\npart,  and  affirming  it  in  part.  This  Court  thereupon  took  up\nthe  matter  of  entering  its  order  to  the  extent  that  the\njudgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  directs  it  to  do so.\nThe matter  is  complicated  by  this  Court's  practice\nnot  to  rehear  or  retry  matters  which  have  been  remanded  to  it\nafter  a  reversal  by a  higher  court.  This  practice  is  mandated\nby  local  rules  in  many  districts,•but  not  in  the  Northern\nDistrict  of  Ohio.  In  this  case,  however,  at  least  a  part  of\nthe  orders  involved  were  not  reversed,  but  were  affirmed.  As\nto  those  matters  upon which  this  Court's  judgment  was  affirmed,\nno  further  hearing  is  needed.  Therefore,  the  reasons  which\ninhibit  this  Court  from  retrying  or  rehearing  matters  in  which\nit  has  been  reversed  do  not  operate  to  prevent  it  from  entering\nits  findings  and  conclusions  resulting  from  the  April  2 and  3,\n19 84,  hearing  as  to  the  limited  matters  upon which  its  judgment\nwas  affirmed.\n\nHaving  taken  the  matter  up,  and  studying  nearly  five\nhundred  pages  of  briefs  and  transcripts,  and an  equal  or  larger\namount  of  other  material,  and also  having  submitted  a draft  of\nan order  to  counsel,  and  received  and  studied  their  comments\nthereon,  this  Court  will  make  these  findings  and  conclusions\nresulting  from  the  hearing  that  are  connected  with  the\naffirmance  of  its  judgment  in  the  March  25,  1985,  opinion  of\nthe  Court  of  Appeals.\nMuch  of  the  evidence  at  the'April  2 and  3,  1984,\nhearing,  and  the  arguments  of  counsel  have  to  do  with  those\nsubsections  of  paragraph  VI,  and  paragraphs  VII  and  VIII  of\nthis  Court's  June  Order,  which  were  stricken  down  by  the  Court\nof  Appeals.  As  to  those  matters,  this  Court  will  make  no\nfindings  or  conclusions  herein.  What  is  left  is  the  injunction\nin  section  a.  of  paragraph  VI  forbidding  engaging,  or\ncontinuing  to  engage,  in  any  acts  or  practices  which  have  the\npurpose  or  effect  of  denying  equal  housing  opportunities\nbecause  of  race,  color,  religion,  national  origin,  or  sex,  and\nthe  provisions  of  paragraph  IX  ordering  a  special  plan  of\naffirmative  action  to  reduce  the  racial  segregation  within LMHA\n\nlocations^,  with  certain  specific  matters  to  be  included  in\nthe  plan.\nEven  as  to  these  very  limited  matters,  there  is  a\ngreat  deal  of  dispute  amongst  the  parties.  The  Court  will  not\ndiscuss  all  of  these  matters  in  minute  detail,  and will  mainly\ncast  its  findings  and  conclusions  into  the  form  of  the\naffirmative  action  plan  that  the  Court  of  Appeals  finds  it\nproper  to  require.  This  plan  will  subsequently  be  referred  to\nherein  as  \"the  plan.\"\nThe  first  major  dispute  between  the  parties  is  the\nduration  of  the  plan.  The  defendants  propose  that  the  plan\nshall  be  in  effect  only  for  three  years,  whether  it\naccomplishes  anything  or  not.  The plaintiffs  propose  that  the\nplan  shall  be  in  effect  for  at  least  four  years,  or  two years\nafter  any  specific  goal  of  the  plan  has  been  attained.\nEssentially  this  dispute  arises  out  of  technical  and\nsemantic  matters,  and  overlooks  the  basics  of  the  problem.\nIn  this  case,  the  Court  originally  found  that  after\nsome  thirty  years  after  the  LMHA was  ordered  to  desegregate,  it\nhad  still  not  done  so.  The  Court  of  Appeals  finds  no  clear\nerror  in  this  finding.  The  Court  then  enjoins  the  defendants\n1\"Location\"  means  any  low-rent  housing  site  as  established  in  a\nDevelopment  Program,  except  that  when  sites  are  adjacent  or\nwithin  a  block  of  each  other,  such  sites  shall  be  considered\none  location.  In  scattered  site  developments,  the  local\nAuthority  shall  make reasonable  determinations  of  \"locations\"\nbased  on  the  specific  scatterization,  including  any  groupings\nthat  may  be  reasonably  consistent  with  the  purpose  of  this\norder.\nThe  Public  Housing  Occupancy  Handbook,  1978,  7456.1 Rev.  P. 2\n5ld.(l)(a)  (second  sub-paragraph).\nAO72A\n(D.u  R/R?)\n\nfrom  denying,  or  continuing  to  deny,  equal  housing\nopportunities.  This  is  a  classical  restraining  order,  and  is\nin  no  sense  a  mandatory  injunction.  As  such,  to  use  the\nclassical  legal  term,  it  is  \"perpetual,\"  that  is,  it  runs\nforever.  Thus  any  quibbles  about  the  time  period  of  a  plan  to\nkeep  the  defendants  in  compliance  with  this  order  overlooks  the\nfact  that  there  will  never  come a  time  when  the  defendants  may,\nwith  impunity,  engage  in  discriminatory  practices  which  violate\nthe  injunction.\nIn  the  legal  literature,  there  is  considerable  highly\ntechnical  discussion  as  to  the  exact  procedural  method  of\ndealing  with  a  violation  of  a  perpetual  order  of  injunction.\nThat  again  is  of  l i t t le  practical  consequence.  Whether\nenforcement  is  by  a motion  in  the  original  action  to  compel  the\nviolator  to  show cause  why he  should  not  be  found  in  contempt,\nor  by  a  new  action  seeking  to  enforce  the  judgment,  is  of  no\nconsequence.  The  current  practice  in  Ohio  and  particularly  in\nthis  Court,  is  to  proceed  by  way  of  a  motion  in  the  original\naction.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  Taylor  v.  Perini,  455\nF.Supp.  1241  (N.D.  Ohio  1978),  after  all  these  years  hardly  a\nmonth  goes  by  without  a  motion  to  show  cause  being  filed  and\nultimately  disposed  of.\nThe  purpose  of  the  plan  is  to  reduce  as  much  as\npossible  the  need  to  be  constantly  taking  action  to  enforce  the\ninjunction,  by  detailing,  insofar  as  it  is  possible  to  do  so,\nwhat  actions  or  activities,  or  lack  thereof,  will  give  rise  to\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\ncharges  of  violation  of  the  injunction,  and  to  set  up some\nstandards  which  will  simplify  the  determination  of  whether  or\nnot  the  injunction  is  in  fact  being  violated.\nIt  should  be  clear  from  the  foregoing  that  there  is\nno  reason  to  set  an  ultimate  duration  for  the  plan.  Like  the\ninjunction  itself,  the  plan  must  necessarily  be  perpetual.  At\nthe  same  time,  the  plan  must  be  subject  to  modification  on\nmotion  whenever  it  appears  that  it  is  failing  in  some  respect\nto  accomplish  its  purpose.  >\nThere  are  a  multitude  of  disputes  about  the  details\nof  those  portions  of  the  affirmative  action  plan  which  deal\nwith  specific  actions  which  the  Court,  in  paragraph  IX of  the\nJune  Order  suggests  should  be  used  to  reduce  the  racial\nsegregation  which  the  Court  found  to  exist  in  the  LMHA housing\nprojects.  '  -\nThe  resolution  of  these  matters  can  be  simplified  if\nagain  it  is  born  in  mind  that  this  is  an  action  to  enjoin  the\ncontinuance  of  practices  which  have  led  to  the  existing\nsegregation.  Much argument  is  devoted  to  whether  or  not  there\nshould  be  some  precise,  numerical  percentage  figures  which\nwould  serve  as  a  touchstone  to  determine  whether  any  particular\none  or  all  of  LMHA' s  housing  locations  are  in  fact  segregated.\nThe  Court  of  Appeals,  on  page  40  of  its  March  25,  1985,\nopinion,  points  out  some of  the  problems  in  this  area.\nAs a practical  matter,  the  closer  one  comes  to  fixing\nprecise  percentage  figures,  the  closer  one  comes  to  a  system of\nAO72A\n<R»v. 8/82)\n\nquotas.  This  Court  had  considerable  knowledge  about  quotas\nlong  before  the  modern desegregation  litigation  began.  Quotas\nare  one  of  the  oldest,  and  often  one  of  the  subtlest,  methods\nof  practicing  discrimination.  Even  the  use  of  the  word  \"goal\"\ncomes  uncomfortably  close  to  quota  in  this  Court's  judgment.\nOnce again,  to  go  back  to  basics,  it  is  appropriate\nto  take  a  look  at  what  evidence  will  establish  the  fact,  or  a\npresumption,  that  unlawful  segregation  exists.  In  general,\nsuch  evidence  compares  the  ratio  of  the  numbers  of  various\ngroups  in  some larger  or  general  population  with  the  ratio  in\nthe  particular  areas  where  it  is  asserted  that  segregation\nexists.  A marked  discrepancy  is  sufficient  to  establish  at\nleast  a  pr ima  facie  case  of  discrimination.  It  is  not\nunreasonable  to  find  that  such  a  marked  deviation  from  the\nratio  in  the  large  population  is  the  result  of  deliberate,  and\nof  course  illegal,  efforts  to  bring  it  about.\nThis  rule  is  easy  to  employ  in  resolving  whether\nracial  segregation  exists  in  the  employment  of  large  numbers of\nnot  particularly  skilled  workers.  It  becomes  increasingly\ndifficult  to  use  in  cases  involving  age  or  sex  discrimination\nin  employment,  or  in  professions  or  highly  skilled  occupations.\nIn  this  particular  case,  this  method  is  quite\nworkable,  if  it  is  employed  rationally.  The  basic  ratio  of\npopulation  used  cannot  properly  be the  ratios  between  majority\nand  minority  groups  in  the  general  population,  because  the  vast\nmajority  of  the  general  population  does  not  live  in  public\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nhousing.  But  the  number  of  people  who  do  live,  or  desire  to\nlive,  in  public  housing  within  the  jurisdiction  of  LMHA  is\nsufficiently  great  that  the  ratios  of  the  various  groups  within\nthat  limited  population  affords  a  reasonable  standard  for\ndetermination  of  whether  a  particular  project  is  segregated  or\nnot.  Affirmative  action\" essentially  means  taking  all  possible\nsteps  to  bring  the  particular  into  the  same  ratio  as  the\ngeneral,  and  to  do  so  with  reasonable  promptness.\nThere  appears  to  be  little  dr  no  dispute  that  the\nratio  of  minorities  to  majorities  in  family  housing,  both  in\nthose  housed  and  those  waiting  to  be  housed,  is  somewhere\nbetween  seven  (7)  to  three  (3)  and  six  (6)  to  four (4).  In  the\nelderly  housing,  the  ratio  is  somewhere  close  to  even.\nThe  plaintiffs  argue  that  after  four  years  of\naffirmative  action  each  LMHA family  housing  project  should  have\na  precise  ratio  of  7.7  minority  to  2.3  majority,  and  in  the\nelderly  projects,  the  precise  ratio  should  be  4.5  minority  to\n5.5  majority.  Conversely,  the  defendants  argue  no  segregation\nexists  if  in  family  housing  the  ratios  are  anywhere  between  5.7\nminority  and  4.3  majority  and  9.7  minority  to  .3  majority.  in\nelderly  housing  the  ratios  range  from  2.5  minority  to  7.5\nmajority  and  6.5  minority  to  3.5  majority.\nObviously,  in  dealing  with  so  complex  and  difficult  a\nproblem,  neither  exact  mathematical  precision  nor  a  spread  so\nbroad  as  to  be  meaningless  are  proper  criteria  for  the  use,  or\nthe  success  or  failure,  of  an  affirmative  action  plan.  The\nA0 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nCourt therefore concludes that the ratio used to determine the\nexistence of segregation should be that between racial majority\nand minority in the list of people housed and awaiting housing,\nnot  those  ratios in the entire population of the Toledo\nMetropolitan area.  So long as the minority population in any\nfamily housing location is approximately  three-quarters of the\ntotal occupancy, and in elderly housing is approximately half\nof the_ total occupancy, the injunction is being complied with.\nThe Court will not entertain contempt'proceedings so long as,\nat the end of each six month period after the effective date of\nthis Order, it appears that in each housing location t.-.e ratio\nis measurably closer to this standard than it was at the end of\nthe preceding period.  Reporting  need not be continued after\nthese ratios have been maintained in all locations for a period\n.of one year.\nThe  much  more  difficult  problem  is  that  of  planning\nfor  particular  methods  of  bringing  about  this  result.  As  to\nthis  the  plaintiffs  propose  a  number  of  specific  actions  to  be\ntaken.  They  include  not  permitting  any  minority  person  on  the\nwaiting  list  to  be  given  housing  in  any  location  with  a\nminority  population  of  over  ninety  percent  (90%);  if  vacancies\nare  available  in  more  than  one  location,  permitting  minority\napplicants  only  to  be  offered  housing  in  the  location  having\nthe  smallest  percentage  of  minority  applicants;  during  certain\nperiods,  giving  housing  occupants  who  are  willing  to  transfer\nto  other  locations  where  the  transfer  will  improve  the\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\n-LU\nminorizy-majority  ratio  priority  over  persons  on  the  waiting\nlist  for  housing  and  persons  entitled  to  transfer  because of\nhardship;  inducing  persons  to  make  such  transfers  by  moving\nthem  or  paying  their  moving  expenses,  or  by  giving  them a\nrant-free  month  in  the  new quarters,  or  both;  in  cases  where  a\nlocation  is  at  or  close-to  one  hundred  percent  occupancy  by one\nrace,  arranging  so  that  new or  transfer  tenants  of  the  opposite\nrace  can  come  in  as  a group  of  five  families,  so  that  no  single\nfamily  will  be  the  first  to  change  the  racial  complexion;\nrequiring  the  federal  defendants  to  grant  LMHA additional  funds\nto  hire  maintenance  and  administrative  personnel  to  expedite\nthe  filling  of  vacancies  in  the  housing  locations;  and\nrequiring  the  federal  defendants  to  grant  LMHA large  amounts  of\nmoney  to  rehabilitate  or  refurbish  older  and  more  decrepit\nhousing  locations  to  make  them more  attractive.\nAs opposed  to  this,  the  defendants  in  essence  propose\nto  make  no  changes,  but  simply  to  go  on  running  their\noperations  as  they  have  in  the  past.  They  oppose  all  of\nplaintiffs1  suggestions  on  grounds  that  they  violate  the\nseparation  of  the  powers,  or  are  otherwise  beyond  the\njurisdiction  of  the  Court,  or  would  impose  discriminatory\nhardships  upon  the  persons  on  the  waiting  list  for  housing.\nThe  conflicting  proposals  encapsulate  the  real\nproblems  in  this  matter.\nOn  Page  184  of  the  Transcript  of  the  April,  1983,\nhearing,  LMHA's counsel  asked  plaintiffs'  witness  Galen  Martin,\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\n...Is  it  your  statement  then,  you  would\nprefer  the  plan  that  was  less  intrusive,\nand  permitted  the  Housing  Authority  to  run\nthe  Housing  Authority,  as  you  put  it?\nTo which  the  witness  responded,\nNo, I  think  that's  kind  of  far  removed  from\nwhat  I  was —I  was  trying  to  avoid  getting\ndrawn  into  something  that  I  thought  was a\ndetail...There1s  going  to  take  some  amount\nof  extraordinary  remedies  to  overcome  this\nvast  pattern  and  practice  of  discrimination.\nSo,  it's  got  to  be  a  comprehensive  plan.\nIn  response  to  a  question  from  the  Court,  the  witness  Martin\nsaid,\n. . . if  these  things  are  left  vague,  if  it\nseems  like  the  Government  is  speaking  with\na  forked  tongue,  i t 's  unclear  what  the\npeople  are  to  do,  they  may  not  do  well.\nBut  if  they  have  good  leadership,  and  the\nGovernment  provides  the  leadership  i t 's\nsupposed  to,  then  the people  are  going  to\nbe  very  fair-minded....\nThereafter,  at  the  hearing,  the  Court,  responding  to\na  request  of  counsel  that  a  conversation  at  recess  between  the\nCourt  and  the  witness  Martin  be  detailed,  responded  by  saying,\nI  don't  think  our  conversation  dealt  with\nany  factual  matters,  except  Mr.  Martin,  I\nthink  he  will  agree,  that  he  expressed  the\nsame  things  that  he  had  been  expressing\nhere  in  Court,  that  what  you  need  to  have\nis  an  interest  and  desire  to  make  changes\nin  order  to  achieve  results.  And,  I  was\nhappy  with  Mr.  Martin's  testimony  because,\nof  course  t h at what v e  been\nmaintaining,  not  only  in  this  litigation,\nbut  in  any  other  Civil  Rights  litigation\nI've  had.  There  has  to  be  a  fundamental\nchange.  There  has  to  be  a  desire  to  sell\nthe  changes  before  changes  will  be  made.\nThat  is,  the  Authorities,  or  whoever  it  is\nt h at  are  not  complying  with  the\nrequirements,  have  got  to  evidence  a\ndesire....\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\nTranscript,  P.  187.\nIt  is  abundantly  clear  from  studying  the  affirmative\naction  plan  submitted  by the  defendants,  and  their  briefs  filed\nin  respect  to  this  portion  of  this  litigation,  that  there  is  no\ndesire  whatever  upon  the  part  of  the  defendants  to  do  anything\nto  change  the  ancient  pattern  of  segregation  in  the LMHA\nhousing  locations.  Of  course,  things  have  changed  from  the\nsituation  when  Judge  Frank  L.  Kloeb  decided  Vann  v.  Toledo\nMetro Housing  Auth.,  113 F.Supp.  210  (N.D.  Ohio  1953).  There,\narmed  men  were  planning  to  use  bulldozers  as  shields  when they\nproposed  to  resist  by  force  the  first  movement  of  minority\npersons  into  an  all-white  housing  project.  Now the  defendants\nuse  what  psychiatrists  call  the  \"passive-aggressive\"  response\nto  any  efforts  to  make  them  change  their  ways.  Just  as  this\nresponse  is  far  more  subtle  than  brute  force,  it  is  far  more\ndifficult  to  overcome.  Looking  back  at  more  than  thirty  years\nof  efforts  to  enforce  the  moral,  constitutional,  and  legal\nrequirement  of  equal  protection,  it  is  hard  not  to  despair  that\nany  plan  this  Court  may fix  will  bring  about  desegregation  so\nlong  as  the  defendants  do  not  really  want  to  mend  their  ways.\nNevertheless,  since  in  the  posture  of  this  matter  this  Court's\nOrder  stands  to  propose  a  plan  of  affirmative  action  for  the\ndesegregation  of  the  LMHA's housing  project,  the  Court  approves\na  plan  which  reads  as  follows:\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\n13\nI.  General Provisions\nA.  The defendants shall undertake this affirmative action\nplan (hereinafter Plan) to reduce the racial segregation within\nLMHA projects.\nB.  The general objectives of the Plan are to remedy the\neffects of past discrimination and to assure equal housing\nopportunity without regard to race, color, or national origin.\n1.  The objective of remedying.past discrimination\nshall be achieved and maintained so long as the ratio\nbetween minority and non-minority occupants of family\nhousing locations is approximately three.-to one (3:1)\nand in elderly locations, one to one (1:1).\n2.  Any specific housing location will be considered\npredominantly minority or predominantly non-minority\nif the racial composition of its occupants varies by\nmore than two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) from\nthese ratios in either direction.\nC.  The Plan shall continue until its objectives are\nachieved.\nD.  The Plan may be modified at any time by agreement of\nall of the parties hereto, or when, upon motion of any party at\nany time, it shall be made to appear that progress is not being\nmade toward achieving the objectives of the Plan.\nII.

A waiting  list  shall  be  maintained  for  new\napplications  within  each unit  size  category  offered  by LMHA.\nB.  All  applications  for  LMHA housing  shall  be  dated  and\ntime  stamped  when they  are  submitted.  This  time  and  date  stamp\nshall  be used  for  determining  the  priority  of  applications  of\npersons  otherwise  eligible.  •\nC.  Applications  which  are  currently  on  file,  or  which\nconstitute  a  waiting  list,  shall  be  o.rganized  in  accordance\nwith  the  above  criteria.\nD.  All  applicants  for  LMHA housing  shall  be  placed  in\norder  on the  waiting  list  on a  \"first-come-first-served\"  basis\nin  accordance  with  the  date  and  time  of  their  application,\nwithin  the  rent  ranges  established  by  the  LMHA and  sanctioned\nby  HUD;  provided,  however,  that  LMHA,  in  determining\nqualifications  for  receipt  of  assistance  of  persons  applying\nfor  rental  of  housing  shall  not  be  prohibited  from  applying\nfactors  affecting  qualifications,  preferences  or  priorities\nwhich  do  not  involve  consideration  of  race,  color,  or  national\norigin  and  which  have  been  approved  by  all  parties  to  this\naction,  or  such  factors  which  are  required  by  or  are  in\nconformity  with  directives,  circulars  or  regulations  from  time\nto  time  issued  by HUD and approved  by the  plaintiffs,  and  those\npreference  factors  presently  contained  in  the  LMHA Admission\nand  Continued  Occupancy  Policies  and  Regulations.  LMHA may\ncontinue  to  implement  a  \"rent  range\"  policy  designed  to  assure\nthat  a  range  of  income  groups  occupy  LMHA housing  and may\nAO 72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\ncontinue  to  implement  preferences  for  persons  referred  through\nlocal  mental  health  centers.\nE.  Each  applicant  shall  be  offered  the  first  available\nappropriately  sized  unit  in  every  LMHA housing  location  in\nwhich  his  or  her  race  does  not  predominate.  If  more  than  one\nappropriate  unit  is  available  in  a  housing  location  in  which\nthe  applicant's  race  does  not  predominate,  the  applicant  shall\nbe  offered:.,a_  choice_  of  all  such  suitable  units.  If  an\nappropriate  unit  is  not.immediately  available  in  such  a  housing\nlocation,  the  applicant  may\"then  be.offered  an  appropriately\nsized  unit  located  in  any  other  housing  location.  An  applicant\nmay  refuse  to  accept  a  unit  offered  in  a  housing  location  in\nwhich  the  applicant's  race  predominates  beyond  the  proportions\nfixed  in  this  plan,  and  may  wait  until  an  appropriate  unit\nbecomes  available  in  a  location  in  which  the  applicant's  race\ndoes  not  so  predominate,  without  losing  his  or  her  place  or\npriority  by doing  so.\nF.  If  the  applicant  refuses  all  units  offered  in\nlocations  in  which  his  or  her  race  does  not  so  predominate,\nother  than  for  good  cause,  the  applicant  shall  lose  his  or  her\nplace  and  be  placed  at  the  end  of  the  waiting  list.  \"Good\ncause\"  shall  consist  of  either:\n(1)  Physical  needs  of  the  occupant;\n(2)  The  location  would  cause  undue  hardship  with\nrespect  to  health  or  employment;\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\n\"Good  Cause\"  must  be  established  by  the  presentation  of  clear\nevidence  of  the  precise  reason  claimed  by  the  applicant.\nG.  Each  new applicant,  at  the  time  offered  an  application\nto  be  completed,  shall  be  advised  of  options  under  this\nprovision,  and  before  accepting  a  unit,  shall  be  informed  of\nthe  unit  number  of  each  dwelling  which  qualifies  under  this\nprovision  as  available  for  his  or  her  choice.\nIII.  • Transfers  to  Promote  Integration\nA.

He  or  she  shall  be\nconsidered  an  \"integrative  transferee.\"  A tenant  in\nnon-compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  dwelling  lease  shall  not\nbe  eligible  to  apply  for  a  transfer.\nB.  Each  such  tenant  who desires  to  transfer  shall  submit\nan  application  for  transfer  to  the  Office  of  the  Executive\nDirector  of  the  LMHA.  The application  of  each  tenant  shall  be\ndated  and  time  stamped  when  submitted,  and  shall  be  placed  on a\n\"transfer  waiting  list\"  within  the  category  of  each  size  unit\nfor  which  the  family  is  eligible.\nC.  1.  Persons  requesting  \"hardship\"  transfers,  that  is,\ntransfers  necessary  to  place  a  tenant  family  in  a\ndwelling  of  a  size  appropriate  to  the  family  size  and\ncomposition,  or  to  meet  a  compelling  medical  or\nAO72A\n(Rav. 8/82)\n\nemployment  need,  shall  have  first  priority  in  the\n.assignment  of  dwellings.\n2.  Integrative  transferees  shall  have  second  priority\nin  the  assignment  of  dwellings.\n3.  New  applicants  for  housing  shall  have  third\npriority  in  the  assignment  of  dwellings  if  their\nassignment  will  decrease  the  segregation  of  the\nlocation  to  which  they  are  assigned.\n4.  New/;applicants  for  housing  shall  have  fourth\npriority  in  the  assignment  of  dwellings  if  their\nassignment  will  either  not  change or  will; increase  the\n.segregation  of  the  location  to  which  they  are\nassigned.\n5.  Hardship  transfer  applicants  shall  be  offered  the\n•..first  available  unit  in  a  location  in  which  their  race\n..does  not  predominate  beyond  the  proportions  fixed  in\nthis  plan.  If  an  appropriate  size  unit  is  not\nimmediately  available  or  expected  to  become  available\nwithin  one  month  after  filing  the  application  in  a\nlocation  in  which  the  transferee's  race  does  not  so\npredominate,  he  or  she may be  offered  a  unit  in  which\nhis  or  her  occupancy  will  cause  the  least  increase  in\nthe  segregation  of  the  location  to  which  he  or  she  is\nassigned.\nD.  Persons  who  apply  for  transfer  under  this  Plan\nshall  not  be  required  to  r e - e s t a b l i sh  their\n\n18\neligibility  for  public  housing  and  shall  not  be\nrequired  to  provide  information  on  their  transfer\napplication  other  than  their  name,  address,  race,\nnumber  of  persons  in  family,  and  the  sex  and  age of\nfamily members.\nE.  For  integrative  transferees,  LMHA and  HUD shall\neither  pay  the  actual  moving  expenses  for  the\ntransferees  at  a  rate  not  to' exceed  $200 per bedroom\nor  shall  provide  moving  services  at  no  cost  to  the\ntransferee.  In  addition,  HUD and  LMHA shall  not\ncharge  the\"transferee  any  rent  for  the  first  month\nafter  transfer.\nIV.

Each  such  letter  shall  explain  the\nportions  of  this  Plan  relating  to  the  procedures  for\naccomplishing  the  transfer.  Letters  distributed\nAO72A\n(Rev. 8/82)\n\npursuant  to  this  provision  shall  also  indicate  that\nthe  ability  to  transfer  is  limited  by the  availability\nof  appropriate  units  and  that  the  application  to\ntransfer  must  be  submitted  to  the  Office  of  the\nExecutive  Director.  Each  letter  shall  also  include,\nas  an  attachment,  an  application  form  to  be  used  in\napplying  for  a  transfer.\n2.

If  the  defendants  encounter  difficulties  in  persuading\nnew  or  transfer  applicants  to  accept  units  in  projects  in which\nmore than  ninety  percent  (90%)  of  the  tenants  are  of  different\nrace  from  the  applicants,  insofar  as  it  can  be  accomplished\nwithout  creating  more  than  thirty  (30)  days  delay  in  filling\nvacant  units  ready  for  occupancy,  the  defendant  will  so\nschedule  the  housing  of  such  applicants  that  groups  of  three  or\nmore  will  move  into  the  project  at  the  same  time,  and  an\nintensive  counselling  program  will  be  undertaken  for  both  the\nnew  tenants  and  the  present  tenants  in  the  particular  project\nto  facilitate  the  introduction  of  the  new  tenant  or  tenants\ninto  the  project.\nC.
