      "text": "Huntington Mortgage Company Settlement Agreement http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/huntingtonsettle.htm\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n     Plaintiff,\nv.\nTHE HUNTINGTON MORTGAGE COMPANY,\n     Defendant.\n_________________________________________\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n1. The parties, acting by and through their counsel, enter into and file this Settlement Agreement \nsimultaneously with the filing by the United States of its Complaint against The Huntington Mortgage\nCompany (\"Huntington\") alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619, and the\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f. The Complaint alleges that Huntington\nengaged in practices that resulted in discrimination on the basis of race in its pricing of certain\nresidential first mortgage loans in the Cleveland, Ohio metropolitan area.\n2. More specifically, the United States alleges that, during the period October 1991 through September\n1993, Huntington charged 117 African-American customers of its Cleveland office prices for residential\nfirst Mortgage loans that were higher than the average price charged white borrowers in the Cleveland\nmarket without regard to risk or other race-neutral factors. These higher prices were in the form of\n (1)\nhigher \"overages\" paid by African-American borrowers.\n3. The parties agree that certain African-American customers for residential first, mortgage loans were\ncharged prices in excess of the average price charged white borrowers in the Cleveland market during\nthe relevant time period. The United States' evidence consists of a mathematical comparison of overages\ncharged whites and African Americans in the Cleveland market. Huntington contests that any violation\nof law has occurred.\n4. The parties have agreed that, in order to avoid protracted and costly litigation, this controversy should\nbe resolved voluntarily. The parties have also agreed that there should be no evidentiary hearing, trial,\nor other adjudication on the merits, and that entry of this Settlement Agreement is not to be construed as\nan admission by Huntington of the validity of any of the claims asserted in this action.\nI. General Undertaking by Huntington\n5. Huntington agrees that it will not engage in any act or practice that discriminates on the basis of race in \nthe pricing of residential first-mortgage loans; and that it will not impose on the basis of race different\nterms or conditions for the availability of residential first mortgage loans, all as prohibited by the\nprovisions of 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604 & 3605 (Fair Housing Act); 15 U.S.C. § 1691 (a)(1) (Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act); 12 C.F.R. § 202 (Regulation B). The parties agree that this undertaking by\nHuntington, and every other undertaking by Huntington contained in this Settlement Agreement, shall\nbe enforceable by order of this Court upon application therefor by the United States.\n1 of 5 8/2/2007 11:38 AM\n\nHuntington Mortgage Company Settlement Agreement http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/huntingtonsettle.htm\nII. Specific Undertakings by Huntington\n6. The United States recognizes that Huntington has developed and implemented new procedures and\nstandards for pricing residential first mortgage loans system-wide, including comprehensive monitoring.\nThe parties agree that, while these changes have been voluntarily implemented by Huntington, the\nspecific items described in paragraphs 7 and 8 below shall constitute specific undertakings by\nHuntington.\n7. In order to ensure uniform pricing without regard to race or other prohibited bases, Huntington has\ncapped overages on all loan products at 1 percent of the loan amount, absent unusual circumstances and\nonly then with the specific approval of the Huntington compliance officer (see below)\n8. Huntington and its parent bank, The Huntington National Bank, have also implemented a monitoring\nand compliance system to ensure uniform application of pricing criteria by Huntington's loan\noriginators. This system includes:\nA. Restructuring of the management of Huntington to ensure full and complete monitoring of the\nloan origination process and a complete revision of the Huntington Retail Origination Procedures\nManual;\n2. Appointment of senior-level managers at Huntington and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated,\nthe parent holding company of The Huntington National Bank, to serve as compliance officers\nalong with subsidiary positions;\n3. Implementation of a comprehensive system to permit the detailed and ongoing monitoring of\nmortgage origination and pricing practices;\n4. Development and implementation of a new program for monitoring overages to ensure that\nflexible pricing does not result in disparate treatment, including regular analyses of overages by\nrace and other prohibited bases; and\n5. Development and implementation of a new, mandatory training program for all personnel with\ncustomer contact.\n9. In light of Huntington's good-faith self-assessment and voluntary implementation of meaningful\nremedial measures, the United States believes that extensive affirmative procedural practices are\nunnecessary to insure compliance with the provisions of this Settlement Agreement.\nIII. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements\n10. For a period of three years from the date of filing of this Settlement Agreement, Huntington agrees to\nretain all loan application files submitted for residential first mortgage loans and all documents and\nnotices relevant to any pricing decisions in the Cleveland market. Upon reasonable notice, Huntington\nshall make available for inspection and copying by the United States during the three-year term of this\nSettlement Agreement individual residential first mortgage loan application files and related records,\nincluding any analyses of overages conducted by Huntington.\n11. Huntington will report its compliance witIn. this Settlement Agreement to the Civil Rights Division of\nthe United States Department of Justice annually during the three-year term of this Settlement\n (2)\nAgreement.  This reporting shall consist of:\nA. A general report on Huntington's performance in the Cleveland metropolitan area in its processing\nand pricing of applications for residential first mortgage credit submitted by African Americans\nthat addresses, at a minimum, Huntington's residential first mortgage pricing and production,\n2 of 5 8/2/2007 11:38 AM\n\nHuntington Mortgage Company Settlement Agreement http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/huntingtonsettle.htm\nemployee recruitment, compliance activities, training, monitoring, and other relevant information;\nand\n2. A statistical analysis similar to those internally prepared by Huntington and previously provided\nto the Justice Department of overage amounts broken down by race for the relevant period in the\nCleveland metropolitan area. Huntington shall prepare additional statistical analysis of the\nperformance of Huntington in the Cleveland metropolitan area at the request of the United States\nif the United States deems them necessary to measure compliance with the terms of this\nSettlement Acreement. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on the nature of-any follow-up\nanalyses to be conducted, the matter may be submitted to the Court for resolution. All reports will\nbe submitted to the United States within 90 days after the last business day of each calendar year.\nIV. Compensatory Payments\n12. Based on a file review and follow-up analysis conducted by the Department of justice with the full\nCooperation and assistance of Huntington, the United States has identified 117 applications submitted\nby African Americans that were charged prices for residential first mortgage loans greater than the\naverage price charged white borrowers in the Cleveland market between October 1991 through\nSeptember 1993 (the \"aggrieved persons\"). Each such African-American borrower who paid a price\nhigher than the average price charged white borrowers will be deemed to have been aggrieved and will\nbe entitled to compensation pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement; provided, however, that\nany African-American borrower who paid a higher price as part of a scheme to defraud Huntington or as\npart of a scheme to induce Huntington to extend credit based on the submission of blatantly false\ndocuments in violation of federal law shall be excluded from the aggrieved persons entitled to receive\nfunds under this Settlement Agreement.\n13. Within 30 days after the date of filing of this Settlement Agreement, Huntington shall set aside four\nhundred twenty thousand dollars ($420,000.00) to compensate aggrieved persons as defined above\n(Compensation Fund). This fund is to be administered and distributed by Huntington to aggrieved\npersons whom the United States determines to be eligible for compensation, subject to the terms of this\nSettlement Agreement.\n14. The Compensation Fund will not be distributed in a pro rata manner, but rather, the amount of\ncompensation paid to each aggrieved person will be in proportion to the amount paid by them in excess\nof the average price charged white borrowers during the relevant time period. Each aggrieved person\nshall execute a release in the form attached as Exhibit I in exchange for receipt of funds.\nV. Retention of Jurisdiction\n15. This Settlement Agreement may be modified by written agreement of the parties.\n16. This Court will retain jurisdiction of this action for three years from the filing of this Settlement\nAgreement for purposes of enforcing this Settlement Agreement. The parties will endeavor in good faith\nto resolve informally any differences regarding interpretation and compliance with this Settlement\nAgreement prior to bringing such matters to the Court for resolution.\n17. The United States shall have the right to stay termination of this Settlement Agreement for good cause\nshown. In order to stay termination, the United States must file and serve a written objection to\ntermination, which shall be grounded upon a violation or breach by defendants of some provision of this\nSettlement Agreement, no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the Settlement Agreement. If an\nobjection is filed, the Court shall hold a hearing on the motion to stay termination.\n18. Each party to this litigation will bear its own costs and attorneys' fees.\n3 of 5 8/2/2007 11:38 AM\n\nHuntington Mortgage Company Settlement Agreement http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/huntingtonsettle.htm\nAPPROVED this _______ day of __________, 1995.\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nIt is so agreed by the parties.\nFor the United States:\nJANET RENO\nATTORNEY GENERAL\nDEVAL L.

Prior to 1994, overages obtained by Huntington were split\nbetween Huntington and the originator who obtained the overage.

Huntington's business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions and regularly extending credit to\npersons including origination, processing, underwriting, servicing, and sales on the secondary market of residential\nmortgage loans.\n5. Huntington is subject to federal laws governing fair lending, including the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit\nopportunity Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, 12 U.S.C. §§ 2901-2906.\n6. Prior to 1994, Huntington set, on a daily basis, minimum prices for home mortgage loans including interest rates and\nloan origination fees or points. Using these minimum prices, mortgage loan officers employed by Huntington\n(hereinafter \"originators\") determined the interest rate and points they would seek to charge applicants for home\nmortgage credit.\n7. Prior to 1994, Huntington gave mortgage loan originators complete discretion to increase prices, i.e., points and interest\nrates, charged to borrowers over the minimum base prices set by Huntington. Amounts obtained by the originators in\nexcess of the base prices (hereinafter \"overages\") were shared equally between the originator and Huntington.\n8. In June of 1993, the office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) conducted a fair lending examination of\nHuntington. During this examination, OCC examiners reviewed the overages charged on home mortgage loans\noriginated by Huntington during the first six months of 1993. This analysis revealed significant disparities between the\namount of overages charged minority and non-minority borrowers in Huntington's Cleveland office.\n9. The OCC conducted an additional analysis of all mortgage loans originated by Huntington during a two-year period\nending September 30, 1993, including a detailed file review. This analysis revealed that the Cleveland office of\nHuntington charged whites overages averaging 0.07 percentage points compared to an average overage of 0.83\npercentage points for minority borrowers. Thus, minority borrowers paid overages at a rate ten times greater than white\nborrowers in the Cleveland market during the two-year period examined by the OCC (0.07% v. 0.83%).\n10. OCC's June 1993 fair lending examination found Huntington's supervision of fair lending compliance to be ineffective;\nits loan origination policies, internal controls, and training to be inadequate; and the resources allocated by Huntington\nto ensure consumer compliance insufficient. The OCC concluded that Huntington's compliance with fair lending law\nand regulation was unsatisfactory. Huntington has corrected the deficiencies identified by the OCC, as confirmed by a\n1 of 3 8/2/2007 11:36 AM\n\nHuntington Mortgage Company Complaint http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/huntingtoncomp.htm\nfair lending examination conducted in August of 1994.\n11. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(g), the OCC referred the matter to the Attorney General on August 5, 1994 for\nappropriate enforcement action, following the OCC's determination that Huntington may have engaged in a pattern or\npractice of discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit opportunity Act.\n12. Upon receipt of the OCC referral, the Attorney General initiated a follow-up investigation and analysis that included a\nreview of the applications and loan files of all African Americans who applied for home mortgage credit with the\nCleveland office of Huntington from October 1991 to September 1993. This analysis revealed that the average overage\nduring this period for all African-American borrowers was 0.86 percentage points compared to an average overage of\n0.07 percentage points for whites as determined by the OCC.\n13. Prior to 1994, Huntington promulgated no standards and provided no guidance to mortgage loan originators concerning\nthe appropriate factors to considerin determining whether, and in what amount, to seek overages; and did not review,\nmonitor, examine, or analyze the overages charged African-American applicants compared to white applicants to ensure\nthat originators were not charging higher overages to African Americans without adequate race-neutral justification.\n14. The disparities in overage amounts charged African-American mortgage loan applicants and white mortgage loan\napplicants as discussed in Paragraphs 9 and 12 did not occur by chance and cannot be explained by differences in the\nrelative qualifications of white applicants and African-American applicants for mortgage loans, or by other nonracial\nfactors.\n15. Huntington's policies and practices as alleged herein constitute:\na. Discrimination on the basis of race in making available residential real estate-related transactions in violation of\nSection 805 of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a);\n2. Discrimination on the basis of race in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the provision of services or facilities\nin connection with the sale or rental of dwellings, in violation of Section 804(b) of the Fair Housing Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 3604(b); and\n3. Discrimination on the basis of race against applicants with respect to credit transactions, in violation of the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a)(1).\n16. Huntington's policies and practices as alleged herein constitute:\na. A pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights secured by the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 3601-3619, and the Equal Credit opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f; and\n2. A denial of right's granted by the Fair Housing Act, as amended, to a group of persons that raises an issue of\ngeneral public importance.\n17. Persons who have been victims of Huntington's discriminatory policies and practices as alleged herein are aggrieved\npersons or applicants as referenced or defined under the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and\nhave suffered damages as a result of Huntington's conduct.\nWHEREFORE, the United States prays that the court enter an ORDER that:\n1. Declares that the policies and practices of Huntington constitute a violation of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619, and the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f;\n2. Enjoins Huntington, its employees, agents, and all other persons in active concert or participation with them, from\ndiscriminating on account of race in any aspect of their mortgage lending activities;\n3. Requires Huntington to develop and submit to the Court for its approval a detailed plan that: (a) remedies the vestiges of\nHuntington's discriminatory policies and practices; and (b) ensures that future African-American applicants are treated\nin a nondiscriminatory manner that does not differ from the treatment afforded to white applicants; and\n4. Awards such damages as would fully compensate the victims of Huntington's discriminatory policies and practices for\nthe injuries caused by Huntington.\n2 of 3 8/2/2007 11:36 AM\n\nHuntington Mortgage Company Complaint http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/documents/huntingtoncomp.htm\nThe United States further prays for such additional relief as the interests of justice may require.\nJANET RENO\nAttorney General\nDEVAL L.

      "text": "Fair Lending Enforcement Program http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/bll_01.htm\nPricing Discrimination\nWe have brought several suits challenging discrimination in the price of credit. In the mortgage lending\narea, pricing disparities often arise as a result of discriminatory application of \"overages,\" that is, the\ndiscretionary authority of employees or brokers to charge rates higher than the lender's set rates, for\nwhich the employees receive additional compensation. It should be emphasized that the higher prices\nresulting from overages are not related, in any way, to the qualifications of the borrower or the risk to the\nlender. The use of an employee or broker incentive program such as an overage system is not unlawful\nper se, but it becomes unlawful if applied in a manner to extract higher prices from minorities or women\nbecause of their race, national origin or gender.\nThe \"overage\" issue was involved in a lawsuit filed by our Department against the Huntington Mortgage\nCompany in Cleveland in 1995, in a lawsuit filed in 1996 against the Fleet Mortgage Company in\nBrooklyn, and in a suit filed in 1996 against Long Beach Mortgage Company in California. In the\nHuntington and Fleet cases, we alleged that mortgage company employee loan officers were charging\nAfrican-American and/or Hispanic borrowers higher up-front fees for home mortgage loans than they\nwere charging to similarly situated white borrowers, and that these differences in price could not have\noccurred by chance and could not be explained by differences in the borrowers' loan qualifications.\nUnited States v. The Huntington Mortgage Company, Case No. 1:95 CV 2211 (N.D. Ohio 1995); United\nStates v. Fleet Mortgage Corp., Case No. CV 96 2279 (E.D.N.Y. 1996).\n1 of 1 8/2/2007 11:39 AM",
