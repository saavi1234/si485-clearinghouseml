    "summary": "<p>In April 1989, Project B.A.S.I.C. (\"BASIC\"), a Rhode Island tenant-advocacy organization, filed a lawsuit against the State of Rhode Island under 42 U.S.C. §1983, the United States Housing Act, the federal Fair Housing Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  The plaintiffs alleged that their constitutional rights had been violated by race-based mismanagement of public housing units in the city of Providence, and they asked the District Court for an injunction to prevent the proposed demolition of condemned public housing units in the city.  </p><p>On July 17, 1989, the District Court (Judge Raymond James Pettine) denied the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, holding that they had stated cognizable claims, but that they had not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of those claims.  The District Court ordered the plaintiffs to submit a memorandum of law within two months, detailing more specific allegations as to which statutes it believed to have been violated.  The Court also entered an order establishing a time schedule for construction of replacement housing.  Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 721 F.Supp. 1501 (D.R.I. 1989).  The defendants appealed.</p><p>On July 6, 1990, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (Judge Stephen Breyer) remanded the case for reconsideration, holding that the amendment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \"demolition permission\" statute did not apply to post amendment demolition activities in the case at bar, but that alternative bases might exist for the District Court's time schedule injunction.  Project B.A.S.I.C. v. O'Rourke, 907 F.2d 1242 (1st Cir. 1990).</p><p>On April 2, 1991, the District Court (Judge Pettine) denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment, holding that the plaintiffs had raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether sufficient, comparable housing opportunities existed in nonminority areas of the city.  Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 637 F.Supp. (D.R.I. 1991).</p><p>On April 16, 1991, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement in the case, agreeing that HUD would fund 109 replacement housing units in specified areas of the city within 36 months.  The settlement also stipulated that all parties would bear the costs of their own attorneys' fees.  Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, No. 89-0248, 1991 WL 329756 (D.R.I. April 16, 1991).  </p><p>Shortly after the stipulated settlement, a contractor selected to build the replacement housing filed a lawsuit to enjoin the housing authority's withholding of $500,000, pursuant to the order of HUD.  On June 14, 1991, the District Court (Judge Pettine) issued an order holding HUD in contempt of the stipulated settlement, fining them $250,000, with an additional fine of $2000 per day until the organization removed all barriers to the money.  Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 768 F.Supp. 21 (D.R.I. 1991).  The defendants appealed.  On October 17, 1991, the First Circuit (Judge Bruce Marshall Selya) reversed the District Court's contempt order and remanded the case, holding that HUD had not been given fair notice of the violation.  Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 947 F.2d 11 (1st Cir. 1991).  </p><p>We have no further information on the proceedings in this case, and as of 1/12/2007, there is no PACER docket available.</p><p></p>",

Cosentino, Providence, R.I., for City of Providence and\nProvidence Community Action.\nOPINION AND ORDER\nPETTINE, Senior District Judge.\nThe Providence Housing Authority (hereinafter, \"PHA\"), a defendant in this action, operates the Hartford Park\nhousing project, consisting of 748 apartments in the City of Providence. The plaintiff, Project B.A.S.I.C., is an\nunincorporated association of tenants and housing advocates in the City of Providence, including low-income and\nminority persons who are themselves residents of the Hartford Park housing project. The defendants are: the\nUnited States Department of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter, \"HUD\") and Jack F. Kemp in his\ncapacity as Secretary of HUD (together, \"the federal defendants\"); the Housing Authority of the City of Providence\n(hereinafter, \"the PHA\") and Stephen J. O'Rourke in his capacity as the Executive Director of the PHA (together,\n\"the PHA defendants\"); the City of Providence; and the Providence Community Action Program. In the instant\naction, plaintiff challenges the proposed demolition of three high-rise apartment towers at Hartford Park which\ntogether contain 240 units and the proposed construction of replacement housing on \"scattered sites\" in the City\nof Providence, as violative of the United States Housing Act, the federal Fair Housing Act and the National\nEnvironmental Policy Act. Plaintiff also challenges the decision changing the site of a shelter for the homeless\nfrom the Elmwood area of Providence to Hartford Park as violative of the federal Fair Housing Act. Plaintiff filed a\nmotion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction of the demolition on April 20, 1989. Plaintiff\nhas alleged an organizational injury, causation and redressability in this action sufficient to find that it has\nstanding. See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982); Project\nBasic Tenants Union v. Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corp., 636 F.Supp. 1453 (D.R.I.1986)\n(analysis of constitutional standing of unincorporated association).\nThis Court granted a temporary restraining order on April 21, 1989, prohibiting defendants from taking any further\nsteps to demolish the three high-rise buildings slated for demolition. This order was subsequently modified by an\norder allowing defendant Providence Housing Authority to demolish the high-rise building at 375 Hartford Avenue,\nafter a hearing at which the defendants presented an expert witness who testified that the building had been\n\n1504 structurally damaged by preparation for demolition and was not safe.[1] The demolition *1504 preparation work\nhad not progressed as far on the other two towers, 12 Bodell Avenue and 22 Whelan Road, and no party alleges\nthat these two buildings are now structurally unsound.\nThe federal defendants have moved this Court to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, under\nFed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, under Rule 12(b)(6). In\nthe alternative, the federal defendants moved for summary judgment. The PHA defendants joined these motions.\nBecause I find that this Court does have jurisdiction over the subject matter, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1331,\nand that plaintiff has stated a cognizable claim, the motion to dismiss is denied. I will therefore consider only\ndefendants' alternative motion for summary judgment.\nAt a hearing held on June 6, 1989, the parties agreed to submit memoranda addressing the merits of the issues\npresented and agreed that Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or\nAlternatively for Summary Judgment would be consolidated for decision. This Opinion should be understood as\ndisposing of all pending motions in this action, except as to the siting of the shelter for the homeless, which is\nexpressly reserved for later decision.\nFACTS\nThe defendant PHA applied to HUD for federal funds through the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance\nProgram (hereinafter \"CIAP\") to modernize the housing units at Hartford Park, including the 240 at issue here,\nand Manton Heights, another housing project operated by the PHA. It filed a Preliminary Application on March 20,\n1987. The cover letter from the PHA's Executive Director noted that \"the enclosed application is based on the\nassumption that the proposed comprehensive modernization of each project will assure each project's long-term\nviability. The Authority expects to subsequently amend this preliminary application to propose demolition of\nportions of Hartford Park as an alternative to modernization if it is determined that modernization will not assure\nits long-term viability.\"\nThe following month, the PHA submitted to HUD an application for the development of 360 units of public\n[2]\nhousing.  This request was predicated on the PHA's plan to demolish all four high-rises, containing a total of\n360 units, at Hartford Park: 375 Hartford Avenue (60 apartments), 12 Bodell Avenue (90 apartments), 22 Whelan\nRoad (90 apartments) and 10 Whelan Road (120 apartments). The application included a \"Statement of Intent to\nMake Application for the Demolition of Public Housing Units,\" specifically the four high-rise structures, as an\nalternative to their rehabilitation if it was determined that they would not be viable even if rehabilitated. The\nAuthority reported that it had contracted with a private consultant, the McHenry Co., Inc., for a physical needs\nassessment which would analyze the viability of all PHA projects in need of modernization and estimate the cost\nof comprehensive modernization and demolition at Hartford Park. In the \"Statement of Intent,\" the PHA evaluated\nthe viability of the buildings according to the criteria of the Code of Federal Regulations (hereinafter, \"C.F.R.\"). It\nwas clear from this evaluation that the PHA had already decided that the high-rises were not viable. The PHA\nstated that, pursuant to 24 C.F.R. 970.6(a) and (b), the four high-rise buildings were obsolete and no reasonable\nprogram of modifications was feasible to return these buildings to useful life. In addition, the PHA stated that \"the\ndemolition of only parts of Hartford Park will help assure the useful life of the remaining portions of the project\n(e.g. it will reduce project density),\" parroting the words of 24 C.F.R. 970.6(c).\nOn June 11, 1987, the PHA submitted a revised CIAP Fiscal Year 1987 Preliminary Application, still requesting\n1505 funds for the *1505 modernization of all housing units at Manton Heights and Hartford Park, including the four\nhigh-rise buildings, and again noting that the application was based on the assumption that the proposed\ncomprehensive modernization of each project would assure each project's long-term viability. In the attached\nletter, the PHA stated that it would withdraw the request for funds for modernization of the Hartford Park high-\nrises not if it was determined that modernization would not assure the project's long-term viability (the condition\nstated in the previous application) but rather \"if the Authority's development application is approved.\" Attached to\nthe application was a Project Viability Test, in which the PHA noted certain problems as to physical condition and\nunspecified \"other factors\", but recited that these problems would be solved by modernization; for example, the\n\nPHA checked \"YES\" as the answer to the statement: \"After proposed modernization, the project will be suitable\nfor operation as public housing in accordance with program standards for a period of at least 20 years.\"\nContrary to these assertions that modernization would restore the viability of the high-rises was the resolution\npassed eight days earlier by the PHA Board of Commissioners. In Resolution 3649, the Board adopted the plan\nto demolish three of the high rises and rehabilitate 10 Whelan Road. It was this demolition plan which was\npursued.\nThe PHA submitted its final Application for Major Reconstruction of Hartford Park on August 20, 1987. The PHA\ntherein sought a total of $16,647,596 for the modernization, including $2,079,000 for the demolition of three high-\nrise buildings.\nThe HUD Field Office in Providence recommended approval of the application, despite the Field Office's finding\nthat the PHA had minimal management capability and minimal modernization capability. In a one-page analysis\nof the factors contributing to project obsolescence, the Field Office set forth a short history of Hartford Park,\ncommenting that these three high-rises contain 240 units, each unit having two floors and an interior stairway.\nThe buildings were originally designed for family occupancy, but proved inappropriate for family use; the PHA\nbegan in 1971 to use them for elderly housing. However, as maintenance and security at Hartford Park\ndeteriorated, the high-rises began to experience significant vacancy rates. In 1982, HUD granted the PHA's\nrequest for a waiver to allow occupancy by persons under 62 years old, but vacancies continued to increase. The\nanalysis concluded:\nAs of May 1987, only 86 of the 360 high rise units, or 24% were occupied. A total of 274, or 76%,\nare vacant. Despite the critical need for decent, affordable housing in Providence, waiting list\napplicants continue to reject offers of high-rise units at Hartford Park and indicate that they prefer\nother sites. Over 35% of all such offers were rejected by applicants last year. It is clear that a\ncertain degree of the market resistance is a reaction to the project's maintenance and security\nproblems. However, we would anticipate serious questions regarding the viability of the three high-\nrise buildings containing two-story units. Their interior stairways and overall design do not offer a\ndesirable living environment for elderly residents. Conversion to family use would exacerbate the\nproject's density problems. At its current level of 748 units, Hartford Park is by far the largest\nconcentration of subsidized housing in Rhode Island. Conversion of the 240 two-story high-rise\nunits to family use would result in a concentration of low income families that would pose a\nchallenge to even the most capable property managers, particularly given the design of the units.\nAccordingly, we do not believe that, even after renovation, these three buildings are suitable for\ncontinued use as public housing, either for family or elderly use. Rather, we believe them to be\nobsolete and would recommend replacing them with units designed to meet Providence's critical\nneed for decent, affordable large family housing.\n1506 As the Field Office report indicated, the problems of the high-rises were numerous *1506 and stemmed from a\nvariety of sources. In discussing the PHA's plan to replace the 240 units in the three high-rises slated for\ndemolition with scattered-site housing and the proposed modernization of the 388 units in low-rise buildings and\n120 one-story units in 10 Whelan Road, the Field Office stated: \"This approach addresses the Hartford Park\ndevelopment's two major design problems 00 the chronically vacant two-story high-rise units and the\n97\noverconcentration of public housing on a single site.\"\nOn September 10, 1987, the Manager of HUD's Providence Field Office wrote to the Executive Director of the\nPHA, informing him that HUD had reserved $16,700,000 for the Hartford Park work, including the demolition of\nthree high-rises. A Modernization Project Grant amendment to the PHA's Annual Contributions Contract was\nexecuted, listing \"9-30-87\" as the \"Date of Modernization Grant Reservation.\"\nThe PHA's Board of Commissioners, on September 24, 1987, passed Resolution 3672. In this resolution, the\nBoard approved the Authority's application for the demolition of 240 units of public housing in the three high-rises,\nbut also resolved that \"no such demolition shall be carried out until the Authority has received any and all\n\nnecessary funding and approval to commence construction of an equivalent number of new, scattered site,\nreplacement units.\"\nThe PHA submitted an application to HUD on September 29, 1987 for approval to demolish three high-rise\nbuildings at Hartford Park. The PHA stated that it had \"determined that a comprehensive program of\nmodernization can not assure the long term viability of three of the Project's high-rise structures\" and was\ntherefore requesting HUD's permission to demolish the 240 units. The PHA specified that demolition of these\nbuildings was in accord with the criteria listed in 24 C.F.R. 970.6(a) and 24 C.F.R. 970.6(b). The demolition also\nsatisfied 24 C.F.R. 970.6(c), according to the PHA: \"Lastly, the demolition of only parts of Hartford Park will help\nassure the useful life of the remaining portions of the project (i.e. it will reduce project density and substantially\nreduce the project's overall vacancy rate).\"\nOn November 27, 1987, the HUD Field Office replied to the PHA's demolition application. The letter stated that\ncertain requirements of HUD's Public Housing Demolition, Disposition and Conversion Handbook (hereinafter,\n\"HUD Handbook\") were not met and that the application appeared deficient in several respects, including the\nplan for relocation of tenants and the report of tenant consultation.\nThe PHA submitted a revised application for demolition of the Hartford Park high-rises on January 20, 1988 to\naddress the concerns raised by the HUD Field Office. This application included a timetable for demolition and\nconstruction of replacement housing, and a schedule for Hartford Park modernization work. The PHA stated as\nits plan to complete all construction of the replacement housing and to begin the modernization work at Hartford\nPark prior to the demolition of the towers.\nThe PHA also submitted a narrative entitled \"Proposed Demolition Criteria\" which was \"based on criteria specified\nin part 970 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\" The PHA cited Sections 970.6(a)(3), (b) and (c) as the\ncriteria which the project met. Although the various portions of the narrative were not designated by criterion, it\nappears that the PHA was claiming that the buildings were obsolete as to factors other than physical condition\nand location. Per Section 970.6(a)(3), major problems indicative of obsolescence include \"factors which have\nseriously affected the marketability, usefulness or management of the property.\" The factors cited by the PHA\nincluded the following:\n00 design of the buildings makes them inappropriate for households with children;\n97\n00 the number of building entrances are difficult and expensive to monitor, and lead to vandalism of\n97\nvacant and occupied apartments;\n00 the \"resulting conditions\" place an immense financial burden on the PHA, which has an adverse\n97\neffect on services and funding to other PHA projects.\n1507 *1507 As to the criterion of 970.6(b), \"No reasonable program of modifications is feasible to return the project or\nportion of the project to useful life\", the PHA cited these factors:\n00 the cost to renovate the high rise units is substantially higher than the cost to renovate the low\n97\nrise units;\n00 the high rise structures will require substantially more long-term maintenance and repair,\n97\nespecially in common areas;\n00 the height and high density of the buildings contribute to their institutional character and high\n97\nrates of vacancy, deterioration, and crime.\nAs to the criterion of Section 970.6(c), \"In the case of demolition of only a portion of a project, the demolition will\nhelp to assure the useful life of the remaining portion of the project (e.g., to reduce project density)\", the PHA\nstated:\nThe demolition of the three towers will result in helping to assure the useful life of the remainder of\nHartford Park. The savings of staffing, management, excessive maintenance and decreased\ncriminal activity will enhance the quality of life for the remaining 508 households, for without the\n\nthree towers as a detrimental catalyst, the financial, physical, and social environment will be\nsubstantially enhanced.\nOn January 28, 1988, HUD's Providence Field Office recommended to John Mongan, the HUD Regional\nAdministrator, that the PHA's application to demolish the Hartford Park high-rises be approved. On January 29,\n1988, Mongan requested approval of the demolition application from James E. Baugh, General Deputy Assistant\nSecretary for Public and Indian Housing. This request included a finding by the Regional Office of Public Housing\nthat the demolition was \"in compliance with 24 C.F.R. 970, with the notations made by the Providence Field Office\nmemorandum dated January 28, 1988.\"\nThe demolition plan was approved by HUD headquarters on February 4, 1988. A letter conveying this approval\nwas sent by Baugh, General Deputy Assistant Secretary, to Mongan, Regional Administrator, on February 4,\n1988. The project approved at this time was \"the rehabilitation of the remaining units and the replacement of units\nwith 184 new public housing units and 120 vouchers.\"\nThe PHA submitted a separate application, on July 20, 1988, for funding for 56 additional scattered site public\nhousing units to replace the units which would be lost as a result of the approved demolition at Hartford Park. The\nFair Housing/Equal Opportunity Division of HUD's Regional Office reviewed the application which it found\n\"approvable\" on the condition that \"areas of non-minority concentration are utilized.\" HUD reserved $4,762,800\non September 28, 1988 for the construction of the additional 56 units of public housing.\nPlaintiff has asked this Court to enjoin HUD and the PHA from taking further steps toward demolition of the\nHartford Park high-rises, unless and until HUD and the PHA have satisfied all the statutory requirements for\ndemolition under the U.S. Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p. The plaintiff also alleges that the PHA and HUD\nhave failed to comply with other procedural requirements, including those of the National Environmental\nProtection Act and the Fair Housing Act, in their actions related to the demolition of the buildings and the\nconstruction of replacement housing.\nTHE APPLICABLE LAW\nIn the First Circuit, a plaintiff must satisfy four criteria in order to be entitled to a preliminary injunction. The Court\nmust find: (1) that plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted; (2) that such injury\noutweighs any harm which granting injunctive relief would inflict on the defendant; (3) that plaintiff has exhibited a\nlikelihood of success on the merits; and (4) that the public interest will not be adversely affected by the granting of\nthe injunction. Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts v. Bellotti, 641 F.2d 1006, 1009 (1981).\n1508 *1508 In reviewing the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction of the demolition, I must determine whether\nplaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. In this action, that determination turns on\nwhether the PHA or HUD violated the law. But first, I must determine what law is applicable. The statute\ngoverning the demolition and disposition of public housing is 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p. This statute was amended\non February 5, 1988 by Section 121 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (hereinafter,\n\"HCDA\"). The amendment made certain changes in the statute's subsections (b) and (d) which pertain to the\ninstant action.\nDefendants claim that Section 121 of the HCDA does not apply to demolition proposals that HUD approved\nbefore the HCDA went into effect. They cite a rule of statutory construction to the effect that a statute should not\nbe interpreted as having retrospective operation unless the legislature has manifestly expressed its intention to\nmake that statute retroactive. The plaintiff argues that the statute as amended by Section 121 is applicable, and\npresents the view of a co-sponsor of the HCDA, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Chairman of the House\nSubcommittee on Housing and Community Development, that public housing authorities and HUD must comply\nwith the new statutory requirements before proceeding with any previously approved demolition. Letter of Rep.\nGonzalez to Samuel Pierce, Secretary, Dep't of Housing and Urban Development, May 4, 1988, Plaintiff's\nAppendix, pp. 422-23.\n\nI need not delve into this controversy, however, because I have determined that the meaning of the statute is\nplain on its face. Subsection (b) prohibits the Secretary of HUD from approving an application or furnishing\nassistance for demolition unless certain provisions are met. Therefore, I will judge the Secretary's compliance\nwith subsection (b) according to that version of the statute which was in effect at the time the Secretary took the\naction of approving the application or furnishing assistance. HUD approved the application on February 4, 1988,\n[3]\nprior to the enactment of the HCDA, so the approval must comply with the unamended statute.  As for what law\napplies to the Secretary's action of furnishing assistance, the parties do not agree on the meaning of the term\n\"furnish assistance\". Plaintiffs allege that HUD furnished assistance to the demolition after February 4, 1988 by\nbeginning transfer of reserved funds to the PHA for demolition work, and that this action compels HUD's\ncompliance with the amended statute. Defendants maintain that HUD furnished assistance to the demolition\nwhen it amended the Annual Contributions Contract on November 5, 1987 to fund the demolition and therefore\nneeds only to comply with the unamended statute. I must adopt HUD's interpretation of the term because it is a\npermissible construction of the statute, under the standard of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). In sum, then, I will evaluate HUD's actions under\nthe statute as it existed prior to the enactment of the HCDA.\nAs to the PHA, however, the current version of 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p expressly states, in subsection (d),\nConditions for agency action: \"A public housing agency shall not take any action to demolish or dispose of a\npublic housing project or a portion of a public housing project without obtaining the approval of the Secretary and\nsatisfying the conditions specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.\" This provision was added by the\n1509 HCDA enacted February 5, 1989. By its terms, it prevents the Providence Housing Authority from demolishing \n*1509 these high-rises unless the PHA has satisfied the conditions specified in subsections (a) and (b),\nregardless of the fact that the demolition was approved prior to February 5. Thus, I will look to the current\nversions of these subsections to evaluate the PHA's compliance.\nTHE APPROVAL GRANTED BY THE FEDERAL DEFENDANTS\nThe plaintiff claims that \"In order for HUD's approval to satisfy the statutory provisions ..., the demolition must be\nthe only way to assure the long-term viability of Hartford Park, especially the `remaining portion' of Hartford Park.\"\nIt cites no support for this rule and research has uncovered none. The statute, 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p, merely\nrequires that if only a portion of a project will be demolished, \"the demolition will help to assure the useful life of\nthe remaining portion of the project.\" The Secretary found that this partial demolition would in fact help to assure\nthe useful life of the remaining portion of the project by reducing the project density.\nIn reviewing this agency decision, I apply the standard set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.\nSection 706:\nThe reviewing court shall ...\n(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be 00\n97\n(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law ...\n(D) without observance of procedure required by law....\nIn making the foregoing determinations, the court shall review the whole record or those parts of it\ncited by a party, and due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.\nIf a rational basis exists to support the agency's action, then I cannot disturb that decision. Bowman\nTransportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 290, 95 S.Ct. 438, 444, 42 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1974). The First Circuit explicated this standard recently in Conservation Law Foundation v. Secretary of the\nInterior, 864 F.2d 954 (1989).\nIt is well-established that this standard of review is highly deferential, whereby the reviewing court\npresumes the agency action to be valid. (citations omitted).\n\nIt is important to note that this Court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the agency. \nCitizens to Protect Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. [402] at 416, 91 S.Ct. [814] at 823-24 [28\nL.Ed.2d 136 (1971)].... We cannot base our decision on what we would decide sitting in the place\nof the agency, but must determine whether the agency's decision can withstand the arbitrary and\ncapricious challenge on review.\n864 F.2d at 957-58.\nI review HUD's approval in light of the information it had before it, the administrative record. HUD was presented\nwith statements by the PHA that \"density\" was one of many problems of the high-rises:\nThe height of the buildings combined with the significantly higher density over the low rise\nstructures, are factors which contribute to the institutional character of the family high rises. This\ntenant resentment has certainly been a factor in contributing to the high vacancy. Tenant\npreference is for low rise structures because of convenience, safety, defensibility of space,\nmaintenance, and management factors. The density of two of the towers is 195 units per acre, or\nover thirteen times the density of the low rise[s]. The third tower is eight times the density of the\nlow rise units.\nStatistics from projects containing high density, high use structures, such as the Pruitt-Igoe\ncomplex in St. Louis and most recently, the Newark Housing Authority, has (sic) shown a direct\ncorrelation of building height and project density to vacancy rates and increased crime. Projects\nwith buildings three stories in height or less typically can maintain vacancy rates under 10%. As\ndensity increases and buildings increase in height, vacancy rates climb dramatically. The PHA's\nstatistics support the identical situation at Hartford Park.\n1510 *1510 Application for U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Approval of Public Housing\nDemolition, January 1988, Administrative Record, pp. 707-08.\nThe fact that partial demolition will always reduce project density is a given; however, the reduction of project\ndensity is not, by itself, enough to meet the criteria for demolition. The issue is whether the demolition, through\nthe reduction in density, will help assure the useful life of the remaining portion of the project.\nThe PHA states that the project density of two of the buildings proposed for demolition is 195 units per acre, or\nover thirteen times the density of the low-rise buildings. This statistic is not very illuminating because there is no\ncomparison attempted between this level of density and that of other neighborhoods in the City. The PHA reports\nthat the high-rises are, not surprisingly, more dense than the low-rises, without reporting whether the high-rises\nare too dense. But the statute allows the use of such fatuous statistics as long as the Secretary can determine\nthat the demolition will help to assure the useful life of the remaining portion of the project.\nBy linking greater height and density to higher vacancy rates and increased crime, the PHA provided some\nevidence which supports the PHA's statement and HUD's determination that the demolition of the buildings would\nhelp to assure the useful life of the remaining portion of the project. The PHA stated that \"The savings of staffing,\nmanagement, excessive maintenance and decreased criminal activity will enhance the quality of life for the\nremaining 508 households, for without the three towers as a detrimental catalyst, the financial, physical, and\nsocial environment will be substantially enhanced.\" Id. at 710.\nThis statement seems sensible, but very little is provided in the record to support it. Where are the statistics\ncomparing the maintenance costs per unit for the high-rises versus the low-rises? Where is the data on the loci of\ncriminal activity? Did the PHA consider the staffing and management which will be required by the scattered site\nreplacement housing as compared to that required by the high-rises? This record is so devoid of pertinent facts,\nstatistics, and comparisons that it is a close question as to whether the approval was arbitrary. That HUD can\nallow the PHA to demolish 240 units of needed housing on the record presented here is incredible to this Court.\nYet this demolition is allowed under the current statutes and regulations.\n\nThe Secretary determined that the PHA's project satisfied the criterion of 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p(a)(1) in that\n\"the partial demolition will reduce the project density and thereby help to assure the useful life of the remaining\nportion of the project.\" Under the law governing the demolition of public housing units, I do not find that this\ndetermination was arbitrary or capricious.\nHUD was also required to comply with subsection (b) of the demolition statute, 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p,\nregarding consultation with tenants and relocation assistance:\nThe Secretary may not approve an application or furnish assistance under this section or under\nthis chapter unless 00\n97\n(1) the application from the public housing agency has been developed in consultation with\ntenants and tenant councils, if any, who will be affected by the demolition ... and contains a\ncertification by appropriate local government officials that the proposed activity is consistent with\nthe applicable housing assistance plan; and\n(2) all tenants to be displaced as a result of the demolition ... will be given assistance by the public\nhousing agency and are relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, which\nis, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their choice, including housing assisted under\n[4]\nsection 1437f of this title.\n1511 *1511 I have reviewed the administrative record to determine whether HUD complied with these provisions.\nFirst, did the PHA develop its application in consultation with tenants and tenant councils? The PHA's Executive\nDirector sent a memo on March 12, 1987, to all Tenant Association Presidents, informing them of its plans to\nsubmit an application to HUD for CIAP funds. The letter stated that, if approved, the CIAP funds \"will be used for\nmodernization and management improvements to promote the long-term physical and social viability of the\nAuthority's public housing projects.\" The notice did not identify the projects to be modernized nor did it mention\nthe possibility of demolition.\nPlaintiff contacted the PHA and HUD in early April 1987, in response to newspaper articles discussing the\npossibility of demolishing the high-rise buildings at Hartford Park, asking that a public hearing on the proposed\ndemolition be held. The manager of the Providence HUD office replied, saying that it was the responsibility of the\nlocal public housing authority to comply with the statutory requirements for public comment on such a proposal.\nThe PHA reported on consultation with tenants in the September 29, 1987 application for demolition approval:\nThe PHA has consulted with representatives of the Hartford Park Tenants' Association on an on-\ngoing basis regarding both the proposed modernization and demolition at the Hartford Park\nproject.... The PHA's Board of Commissioners also established a modernization committee which\nincludes representatives of the project and the project's Tenant Association. Tenants have also\nbeen afforded additional opportunities to comment on the PHA's proposal to undertake demolition\nduring various public meetings of the PHA's Board of Commissioners.\nOn June 3, 1987, the Board of Commissioners of the PHA met. Rose Veiga, a member of the tenants' committee\n(also President of the Hartford Park Tenants Association), spoke in opposition to demolition of any building at\nHartford Park. However, the Board passed Resolution 3649, resolving to demolish three of the four high-rise\nbuildings at Hartford Park and rehabilitate the other high-rise, 10 Whelan Road.\nPlaintiff again contacted the PHA by letter, on July 1, stating \"for the record, Project BASIC is opposed to the\nDemolition of any of the Towers in Hartford Park. We stand by our request, letters to PHA and HUD (April 1 and\n2) and the last PHA Board meeting of June 3, calling for a Public Hearing before any final decision is reached on\nthe Towers. We stand firm in our position that a comprehensive planning process should be undertaken with the\ntenants and others interested in redesigning the Towers to meet the changing needs of families and the physical\nconditions of the buildings.\"\n\nThe PHA published a request for proposals on the potential use of the three towers on July 9, 1987. In response,\nplaintiff submitted a letter on July 13, urging that the PHA use the towers for public housing. The PHA's Executive\nDirector acknowledged this correspondence by letter, stating \"I want you to know up front that the PHA doesn't\nhave plans to renovate or reuse the buildings for our own use.\" Finally, the PHA submitted an application for\nfunds for major reconstruction of Hartford Park on August 20, 1987, including a request for $2,079,000 for the\ndemolition of three buildings.\nThe Hartford Park Tenants Association prepared a \"Demolition/New Construction Proposal\" dated August 26,\n1987. The proposal reflected the Association's position that: \"With the proper Management, Maintenance and\nSecurity plus additional funding we believe that the Hartford Park development could be made to be a decent,\nsafe place for its residents.\" The Association then offered two options 00 one recommending no demolition of any\n97\nHartford Park building, the other recommending demolition of two high-rise buildings of 210 units (10 Whelan\nRoad and 12 Bodell Avenue) and construction of 60 new units on the Hartford Park site.\n1512 *1512 Plaintiff points to its own opposition to the demolition as well as that of the Hartford Park Tenants\nAssociation, in support of its argument that the PHA did not comply with the tenant consultation requirement of 42\nU.S.C. 1437p(b)(1). The federal and PHA defendants refer to the committee of tenants that was formed to meet\nwith the PHA, the comments of a committee member at the PHA Board meeting in June, and the Hartford Park\nTenants Association's alternative proposal of demolition of two high-rises. Although I do not find that the\nconsultation with tenants was exemplary, especially in light of the fact that the PHA solicited very little of the input\nit received, it is true that the PHA had before it the views of those tenants and groups who opposed the\ndemolition. What is unmistakably clear, however, is that the Board did not incorporate any of the suggestions of\nthe demolition opponents into its application. It is rather striking that the defendants can only point to the\nalternative proposal of the Hartford Park Tenants Association, which suggested that two high-rises (one not slated\nfor demolition by the PHA) be demolished, as the point of congruence between the tenants' views and the PHA's\nplan. It is ludicrous to suggest that this proposal, submitted in late August 1987, was adopted in part by the PHA.\nThe PHA's plan was already fully formulated, as shown by the fact that the PHA had earlier applied for funds for\ndemolition of the three high-rises.\nThe PHA is to be faulted for its barebones, lackadaisical efforts to develop its application in consultation with\ntenants and tenant councils. However, based on the administrative record which indicates some effort to gain\ninput from tenants, I do not find that the decision to approve the application despite the limited amount of tenant\nconsultation was arbitrary or capricious.\nIn addition to tenant consultation, subsection (b)(1) of 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p also mandates that the\napplication contain a certification by appropriate local government officials that the proposed activity is consistent\nwith the applicable housing assistance plan. Attached to the PHA's Application for Approval of Demolition,\nsubmitted in January 1988, was a letter dated January 11, 1988 from Providence Mayor Joseph K. Paolino,\ncontaining this statement:\nThe demolition of three of the project's high-rise buildings will undoubtedly improve the long-term\nviability of the remainder of the project. At the same time, the development of the 240 new units of\npublic housing on scattered sites throughout the City will support the City's efforts to upgrade its\nresidential neighborhoods. We have committed substantial resources to the revitalization of our\nneighborhoods and your proposed demolition and development activities are in conformity with\nthe City of Providence's Housing Assistance Plan.\nPlaintiff suggests that this proposed demolition is not in compliance with the local Housing Assistance Plan, which\nstates:\nThe City of Providence is committed to a general policy of not allowing the demolition of\nresidential structures that are occupied or occupiable by low and moderate income families. The\nCity now regularly boards its vacant and abandoned residential properties in an attempt to save\nthem for future reuse. Currently, demolition of such properties is seldom done. Demolition is only\n\nallowed if a property is so structurally damaged that it presents a clear and present danger to the\nsurrounding neighborhood.\nAlthough the PHA's project encompasses demolition which seems to be prohibited by the Housing Assistance\nPlan, in that the two high-rise buildings slated for demolition are not structurally damaged at all, the statute does\nnot require that HUD look beyond the certification of consistency with the HAP. Since that was provided, HUD's\napproval was reasonably granted.\nIt was also necessary for HUD to find that subsection (b)(2) of 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p, dealing with tenant\nrelocation, had been satisfied in order to approve this application. The statute requires that \"all tenants to be\n1513 displaced as a result of the demolition ... will be given assistance by the public housing agency and are relocated \n*1513 to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, which is, to the maximum extent practicable,\nhousing of their choice....\" The PHA stated in its September 1987 application for demolition that approximately\n\"70 families\" would be displaced as a result of the proposed demolition; by the time of the January 1988\napplication, that number had dropped to \"38 households\", presumably due to relocation in the interim. Of these\n38, 32 are single person households. The PHA announced the following relocation plan:\nThere are approximately 330 vacant units throughout all of the Hartford Park development, of\nwhich 124 are units not scheduled for demolition. The 32 single displaced tenants of the 3 highrise\ntowers can be housed temporarily in the remaining high rise comprised of all one bedroom units.\nThis tower, 10 Whelan Road, currently has 94 vacant units, so can easily accomodate the 32\ntenants. The remaining 6 family households can also be relocated to any of the remaining 30\nvacant units at Hartford Park.\nAlthough the PHA did not expressly state that the relocation housing satisfies the description of \"decent, safe,\nsanitary, and affordable housing\", one could infer from the low vacancy rates of the low-rise buildings that this\nwas the case. As to the relocation of tenants into 10 Whelan Road, the PHA knew and HUD was able to\ndetermine that the building was mostly vacant 00 94 vacant units in a building of 120 units means that only 26\n97\napartments were occupied. A tower with such a high vacancy rate would be subject to all the pernicious\nconditions (vandalism of occupied and vacant units, institutional character, tenant resentment) listed by the PHA\nas requiring the demolition of the other three high-rises. However, by adding 32 households to the current\nnumber of tenants, 58 of the 120 units would be occupied, a higher percentage of occupancy than existed at the\nhighrises slated for demolition. HUD approved the PHA's application with this relocation plan. Determining\nwhether a certain housing plan is safe is a decision within HUD's area of expertise. This Court defers to the\nagency's determination of this issue.\nIt must be noted that the statement of \"Relocation Resources and Costs\" included in the January 1988\napplication was premised on an overall \"modernization/new development/demolition strategy\" which had a\nschedule showing that 50% of the new construction would be completed before the demolition contract was\nawarded. Based on this timetable, the PHA predicted that \"when the modernization activities reach the point\nwhere demolition of the 3 towers is required, the new scattered site units will have already been completed to\nfacilitate the final modernization activities of Hartford Park and provide the PHA with replacement housing for the\nscheduled demolition.\" For some reason, which is not documented in the administrative record of more than\n1,000 pages nor adverted to by any defendant, the order of activities in the \"modernization/new development/\ndemolition strategy\" was changed radically. The PHA is now determined to demolish these buildings as soon as\npossible, although modernization and new construction are not even underway. Therefore, the relocation plan\nsubmitted with the January 1988 application is no longer operative. However, it appeared viable at the time of\nHUD's approval.\nOverall, then, HUD's approval of the demolition application submitted by the PHA on the basis of the criteria\nexplicated in 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p was not unlawful, under the scope of review permitted this Court by 5\nU.S.C. Section 706.\n\nTHE CONDITIONS FOR PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCY ACTION\nTurning now to PHA's compliance with 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p, a public housing agency is obligated, according\nto that statute's subsection (d), to satisfy the conditions specified in subsections (a) and (b).\nI find that the PHA complied with the provisions of subsection (a), as to the criterion for demolition being that the\ndemolition of only a portion of the project will help to assure the useful life of the remaining portion of the project,\n1514 and subsection (b)(1), regarding the consultation with tenants *1514 and the local government official's\ncertification of consistency with the local housing assistance plan.\nTo determine whether the PHA has satisfied the conditions of subsection (b)(2) requires that this Court look\nbeyond the administrative record. The PHA defendants stated in their Memorandum in Support of Defendants'\nObjection to Motion for Preliminary Injunction, filed May 30, 1983, that only three tenants were still living in the\nhigh-rises slated for demolition; plaintiff does not dispute this. All other displaced tenants have been relocated, it\nwould appear, and plaintiff has not claimed that the relocation housing is not satisfactory. However, because the\ndemolition is now planned to precede modernization and new construction, it is unclear where the PHA intends to\nhouse the Hartford Park tenants now living in the low-rises and in 10 Whelan Road during the period that those\nbuildings are being modernized. Although the PHA has successfully relocated the households displaced by\ndemolition for the present, I hasten to remind the PHA that it has a continuing obligation to provide these tenants\nwith \"decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, which is, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their\nchoice.\" 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p(b)(2).\nBecause subsection (d) of 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p is formulated as a bar to a public housing agency's actions to\ndemolish, I found, supra, that the PHA must comply with the conditions of the amended version of subsection (b),\ni.e., including the newly-added subsection (b)(3). Subsection (b)(3) requires that the PHA has developed a one-\nfor-one replacement plan, providing for \"an additional decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable dwelling unit for each\npublic housing dwelling unit to be demolished.\" Specifically, the PHA's plan satisfies subsection (b)(3) in that it\nprovides for such replacement dwelling units through its plan for construction of new units on scattered sites. The\nother relevant conditions set forth in subsection (b)(3) appear to be satisfied.\nI must add one caveat. Subsection (b)(3)(D) requires that the public housing agency's one-for-one replacement\nplan include \"a schedule for completing the plan within a period consistent with the size of the proposed\ndemolition ..., except that the schedule shall in no event exceed 6 years.\" The schedule submitted by the PHA\nwith its January application included a schedule which complied with this requirement. The PHA proposed, in its\nJanuary 1988 application which was approved by HUD, that it would use the period from January 1, 1988 to\nOctober 15, 1989 to construct the 240 units of replacement housing. Construction was scheduled to begin on\n[5]\nOctober 15, 1988. To date, construction has not begun.  In fact, HUD had not approved the PHA's partial list of\n[6]\nsites for the replacement housing, as of May 30, 1989.  The step of identifying specific sites and preparing\nrequests for proposals was scheduled to require seven months (January 1 00 August 1, 1988); the task had\n97\nalready taken fifteen months by April 1, 1989, and still was not complete as of that date. Obviously, the schedule\n[7]\nsubmitted to HUD is out of date, but no up-to-date schedule has been presented.  In order to comply with the\nstatute, therefore, the PHA must submit a schedule, with which it intends to abide, for completing the construction\n1515 of the replacement housing. *1515 The PHA received approval for this demolition on the basis of a schedule for\nall phases, identification of the sites to final project close-out, to be accomplished in 23 months (January 1, 1989\nthrough December 1, 1989). I realize that the first step has already taken twice as long as scheduled and that this\nlitigation may have caused these efforts to be suspended, but it is not unreasonable to require that the PHA live\nup to its representations to HUD, starting today.\nIt was on the basis of a 23-month construction schedule that the PHA was given permission by HUD to demolish\nthe high-rises, and it is this schedule which must be followed. To require any lesser degree of compliance would\nbe to make a mockery of the entire statutory scheme. It is inevitable that land prices and construction costs will\nincrease; in the not too distant future, the millions of dollars which HUD has reserved for the PHA will not be\nenough to obtain the lots and build 240 units of housing. The PHA must move swiftly.\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the PHA proceed as soon as possible to begin construction of the 240 public\nhousing units, funded by HUD, needed to replace the 240 units lost due to the past and planned demolition of the\nhigh-rises at Hartford Park. The PHA is ordered to complete construction of all 240 units of replacement housing\nwithin 23 months of the date of this Opinion.\nPLAINTIFF'S CLAIM OF NEPA VIOLATIONS\nPlaintiff has alleged that the procedures used by HUD in assessing the environmental impact of the proposed\ndemolition violate the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (hereinafter \"NEPA\"), codified at 42 U.S.C.\nSection 4321 et seq. HUD conducted an Environmental Assessment (hereinafter \"EA\") of the planned demolition\nwhich contained a \"finding of no significant impact\" (hereinafter \"FONSI\"). Plaintiff challenges this finding as\nincorrect and also claims that the EA was not a good faith consideration of the environmental impact of the\ndemolition.\nThe First Circuit has explicated the task of the district court in reviewing an agency decision subject to the\nrequirements of NEPA as having two aspects:\nFirst, the court makes a substantive review of the agency's action to determine if such action is\narbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 706. This\nsubstantive review, although conducted on the basis of the entire administrative record, is quite\nnarrow in scope. The court should only assure itself that the agency has given good faith\nconsideration to the environmental consequences of its actions and should not pass judgment on\nthe balance struck by the agency among competing concerns (citation omitted).\nSecond, a reviewing court must assess the agency's compliance with the duties NEPA places\nupon it. These duties are \"essentially procedural.\" Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519, 558, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1219, 55 L.Ed.2d 460\n(1978).\nGrazing Fields Farm v. Goldschmidt, 626 F.2d 1068, 1072 (1980).\nI find, upon review of the administrative record, that HUD did give good faith consideration, albeit tardy, to the\nenvironmental consequences of its actions. I now turn to the issue of the agency's compliance with procedural\nduties imposed by NEPA.\n24 C.F.R. 970.4 sets forth the general requirements for HUD approval of applications for demolition or disposition\nof public housing projects:\nHUD will not approve an application for demolition or disposition unless: ...\n(e) Demolition or disposition will meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of\n1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C. 469, and related\nlaws, as stated in the Department's regulations at 24 C.F.R. Part 50.\n1516 24 C.F.R. Part 50 contains instructions that apply specifically to HUD programs, and is *1516 to be used in\nconjunction with 40 C.F.R. Parts 1500-1508, the regulations which establish the basic procedural requirements\nfor compliance with NEPA and are to be followed by all Federal agencies.\nPursuant to the regulations promulgated in Part 50, HUD made an evaluation of the environmental impact of the\nproposed demolition. Kantilal Patel, a general engineer with HUD's Providence office, conducted a field\ninspection of Hartford Park on February 3, 1988 and completed a form entitled \"Environmental Assessment for\nSubdivision and Multifamily Projects,\" including his conclusion: a \"finding of no significant impact.\"\nPlaintiff claims that this finding is incorrect because \"the FONSI was made without any explanation why the\nproposed demolition of the Hartford Park high-rises would not have a significant effect on the human\nenvironment,\" specifically the impact on the availability of public housing. That issue is directly addressed by the\n\nrequirement of a one-for-one replacement plan, in 42 U.S.C. Section 1437p(b)(3). The loss of public housing\nunits is simply not an element of consideration in an Environmental Assessment.\nPlaintiff alleges that HUD should have prepared an environmental impact statement (hereinafter \"EIS\") on the\nproposed demolition because \"HUD's approval of the demolition application was a major federal action\nsignificantly affecting the environment.\" This argument is without merit, however, because HUD was not required\nto prepare an EIS. An EIS is required if the EA indicates that the proposal has significant environmental impacts.\n24 C.F.R. 50.33(d). The EA here indicated that the proposal had no significant environmental impact; therefore,\nno EIS was required. Nor was this proposal among those which HUD has classified as \"normally\" requiring an\nEIS, such as a \"proposal [which] would remove, demolish, convert or substantially rehabilitate 2,500 or more\nexisting housing units....\" 24 C.F.R. 50.42(b)(3).\nHUD's environmental assessment was defective, according to plaintiff, because HUD failed to:\n(1) incorporate the scattered-site plan in the EA;\n(2) begin the NEPA process until a few days before the demolition application was approved;\n(3) involve the plaintiff in the preparation of the EA and notify plaintiff of the availability of the\nFONSI.\nAs to the first objection, the federal defendants state, \"No such assessment was required, however, as the\nenvironmental impact of the scattered site units is unrelated to that of the demolition. (citation omitted). Moreover,\nno such assessment could have been produced, as final site plans had not been established at the time of PHA's\nfunding request 00 and indeed, still have not been established.\" Federal Defendants' Memorandum, filed May 30,\n97\n1988, p. 48. Although the environmental impact of the scattered site units is separate from the impact of the\ndemolition, the two are clearly related. As the federal defendants stated only three pages earlier, \"demolition was\nexpressly linked to construction of replacement housing.\" Id., p. 45. Because of this linkage, it would seem\nimperative to evaluate the environmental impact of the replacement housing in order to assess fully the impact of\nthe demolition. And, if the final sites for replacement housing have not yet been determined, then it would seem\nnecessary to withhold approval of the demolition until the total impact of the demolition and construction could be\nevaluated. But the regulations do not require this comprehensive evaluation, so HUD's inability to evaluate the\nrelated construction project in the context of this EA led to no prejudicial error.\nAs to the second objection, the federal defendants state that \"The General Engineer who prepared the EA was\nthoroughly familiar with the project and the PHA's demolition plan.... His ability to complete the assessment\npromptly resulted from his prior knowledge of the site and the proposal. Moreover, the speed with which HUD\nwas able to complete its analysis also indicates the lack of environmental impact from the proposed demolition.\"\n1517 *1517 The defendants are boasting about speed when they should be concerned about timing. HUD appears to\nhave overlooked the NEPA requirement that \"Agencies shall integrate the NEPA process with other planning at\nthe earliest possible time to insure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, to avoid delays later\nin the process, and to head off potential conflicts.\" 40 C.F.R. 1501.2. The engineer who prepared the EA visited\nthe site on February 3 and filed his report on February 4, the very day the demolition was approved. It appears\nthat HUD waited until the very last moment to do a NEPA evaluation. Although I would not classify this non-\n[8]\ncompliance as merely a \"trivial violation,\"  I find that no prejudicial error resulted.\nI reach the same conclusion of no prejudicial error as to plaintiff's third objection, that HUD failed to involve\nplaintiff in the preparation of the EA and did not notify plaintiff of the availability of the FONSI.\nIn sum, I do not find HUD's approval unlawful on the grounds raised by plaintiff as to NEPA violations, under this\nreview pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Section 706.\n\nTHE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS\nPlaintiff challenges the demolition and the scattered site plan for replacement housing as violative of the Fair\nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 3601 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000a et seq.\nI find the challenge to the demolition on these grounds to be without merit. Plaintiff's statistic, that racial minorities\n[9]\nconstituted 66% of tenants in PHA-operated, federally subsidized family housing in 1981,  might be useful in\nestablishing that demolition without replacement housing would have a disproportionate impact on minority\npersons. However, the plan here is not for demolition alone; the demolition is to be compensated for by the\nconstruction of replacement housing.\nThe challenge to the scattered site plan is not ripe for adjudication at this time. As the plaintiff concedes, \"Neither\nHUD nor the City of Providence has approved the sites for the location of either the 184 or 56 units of scattered\nsite public housing.\" That being so, the controversy is hypothetical and cannot now be heard. See United Public\nWorkers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947).\nHowever, plaintiff's claim has raised an important issue. If plaintiff's fears that \"the proposal to demolish buildings\nat Hartford Park and the PHA's proposed scattered site housing will both exacerbate the residential segregation\nin the city and will disproportionately harm minority residents\" are well-founded, defendants should reconsider the\nplan now. Will the PHA be able to locate a sufficient number of lots in appropriate areas, in accord with the Fair\nHousing Act, the Civil Rights Act, and the Fair Housing/Equal Opportunity Division's condition that the 56 units\nfunded on September 28, 1988 be sited in areas of non-minority concentration, on which to build 240 units of\npublic housing? If defendants determine that the PHA will not be able to do so, the PHA should, on its own or by\norder of HUD, cease demolition of those units which it cannot replace. The citizens of Providence are entitled to\nequate the demolition of the high-rises with the PHA's promise that it can and will build the 240 units of\nreplacement housing.\nTHE PROPOSAL FOR A SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS\nThe plaintiff alleged in its Complaint that certain defendants, namely the City of Providence and the Providence\nCommunity Action Program, violated plaintiff's rights under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 with regard to plans for a\n1518 shelter for homeless *1518 persons to be built in Providence. The defendant, Providence Community Action\nProgram, filed a motion to dismiss on May 30, 1989, to which plaintiff objected on July 7, 1989.\nThis claim is unrelated to the claims challenging the demolition and scattered site housing decisions, so it can be\ndecided separately. Adjudication of plaintiff's claims regarding the proposed shelter must await submission of\nlegal memoranda.\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that plaintiff should submit a memorandum of law on September 15, 1989, which must\ninclude specific allegations as to which statutes it believes have been violated. Defendants in this cause of action,\nthe City of Providence and the Providence Community Action Program, should submit any reply memoranda by\nSeptember 29, 1989.\nCONCLUSION\nIn accord with the above analysis, I find that plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits\nof its challenge to the actions of the PHA and HUD. Therefore, plaintiff's motion for an injunction against the\ndemolition of high-rise buildings at the Hartford Park housing project and for other injunctive relief is DENIED.\nDefendants' motion for summary judgment is PASSED.\n\n[1] 375 Hartford Avenue has been demolished. However, I will continue to refer in this Opinion to demolition of \nthree high-rise buildings because plaintiff's challenge is to the validity of the entire demolition plan.\n[2] In response, HUD reserved $14,531,872 for 184 units of public housing on September 30, 1987.\n[3] Plaintiff argues that HUD had not completed its approval by February 4, citing a letter sent by HUD's\nProvidence Office on February 4 to the State's Historical Preservation Commission, requesting comments as to\nthe effect the demolition would have on historical resources. Although this request does not comply with 36 CFR\n800.3(c) in that HUD had not completed the analysis required by the National Historic Preservation Act prior to\nthe approval of the expenditure, this non-compliance is harmless error, given that the demolition will not affect\nany historical resources.\n[4] The quoted language is from the statute in effect on February 4, 1988, the date of HUD's official approval of\nthe demolition. Section 121 of the Housing and Community Development Act, enacted February 5, 1988,\namended this subsection (b) extensively, by adding a paragraph (3). The amended statute governs this Court's\nreview, infra, of the actions of the PHA.\n[5] Any suggestion that this litigation impeded construction is unavailing because the complaint was filed in April\n1989, six months after construction was to have begun, according to the schedule. In fact, construction was to\nhave begun even earlier than that: a January 28, 1988 memo from the Manager of the Providence HUD Office\nstated that \"the time schedules for demolition, replacement housing, and modernization activities will be revised.\n[T]he Authority is in reality looking for construction and renovation starting this summer (1988).\"\n[6] The federal defendants used this fact in support of their argument, discussed infra, that the issue of the\nscattered site housing is not ripe for adjudication at this time.\n[7] To be precise, the administrative record does not include a revised schedule nor has any party presented such\nschedule for the Court's information.\n[8] According to 40 C.F.R. 1500.3, \"It is the Council [on Environmental Quality's] intention that any trivial violation\nof these [NEPA] regulations not give rise to any independent cause of action.\"\n[9]See Plaintiff's Objection to Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or Alternatively for Summary Judgment,\nfiled June 14, 1989, p. 40.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

For the past twenty-four years my research, teaching, and professional\npractice have focused, mainly, on the civil rights implications of the housing and\nland-use related policies and actions of government, including eitensive\nattention to issues of site selection for public and other assisted housing. I\nsubmit this declaration in further  support of plaintiff's opposition to the federal\ndependent's motion for summary judgement, and in support of the relief\n\n3.  I have reviewed the HUD approved proposals by the Providence\nHousing Authority (PHA) for scattered site public housing, and have examined\nrelevant demographic and housing data for the city of Providence.  My analysis\nof of the proposals and data lead me to conclude that the overall effect of the\ndefendent's  plan for 240 units of scattered site public housing to replace the\n240 units demolished at Hartford Park will increase and reinforce  minority\nsegregation in Providence.\n4. If the proposed plan to locate half of the 240 replacement units in\nareas of minority concentration is carried out as intendecfby  the PHA the\nnumber of minority households living in areas of minority concentration will\nsignificantly increase, the transition to greater density of minority concentration\nin some areas will be accelerated, and the opportunities for low income minority\nhouseholds to obtain affordable  housing outside areas of minority concentration\nwill be far fewer than existed before the demolitions at Hartford Park.  In\naddition, these adverse outcomes will be  further  compounded by the fact that\nover a third of the sites claimed by the PHA to be outside areas of minority\nconcentration are actually in or contiguous tb existing areas of minority\nconcentration.\nQualifications\n5.1 completed  my graduate work in Architecture  and City Planning at\nthe University of Pennsylvania from which I received ray B.

All of ihe data sources and documents used in the preparation of this\nDeclaration are readily available to HUD. ihe PHA. and xhe City of Providence.\n\n-it: •'\nDistribution of Minority Population in the Citv of Provjdenoe\n10. According to the 1980 Census of Population the City of Providence\nhad a total population  156,804, of which 123.222, or 78.6%. were non-Hispanic\nwhite;17,973, or  11.5% were non-Hispanic black; 9071, or 5.8% were\nHispanic; 1,048, or .6% were Native American, Eskimo, or Aleut; 1.694, or 1.1%\nwere Asian; and 3,796, or 2.4% were non-Hispanic other.  The total minority\npopulation of 33,582 comprised 21.4% of Providence population.  (Table I)\n11. Minorities are segregated in three distinctly identifiable areas of\nProvidence.  These three areas, covering all or parts of  17 of Providences 37\ncensus tracts, contain 86.4% of the Gty's minority population.  The first area of\nminority concentration is in the southern section of the Gty (South\nconcentration), and the second two are in north-central Providence, separated\nonly by the rights of way of 1-95 and Route 1 (NE concentration and NW\nconcentration).  Outside of these three areas of minority concentration\nsignificant numbers of minorities are located in distinct enclaves in three public\nhousing projects and in clusters of blocks in 'and adjacent  to Brown University.\nThe three areas of minority concentration, the three housing projects, and the\nBrown University blocks accounted for 93.8% of all minority population in\nProvidence in 1980.\n12. Neither the geographic boundaries of these areas nor the high degree\nto which minorities are segregated in Providence is accurately revealed by\nexamination of population data at the tract level.  Readily available Census\nBlock Statistics dearly reveal that patterns of minority distribution bear no\nactual relationship to Census tract boundaries. For eiample, portions of both\nTract  11 and Tract  13 are part of the South concentration.  Taken as a whole\nneither of these two tracts had a minority percentage higher than that for the\nCity.  However, an examination of the Census Block Statistics reveals that the\nminorities in those tracts are concentrated in the blocks adjacent to Tracts 12\nand  14. both of which have high minority concentrations.\n13. H is also important to recognize ihat an examination of Census of\nPopulation data tabulated at a single time, whether at tract or block level.\nprovides no basis for determining f.rer\\ds  Qnlv through '.he corner-;-?.  \"  ;• ..\n\n:l-40i-:::-5c-:--  npr  •.'-..-i\nE6hL\nfor the same geographic area for more than one time period is it possible to\nidentify  trends.\n14. Here it should also be noted that because the Block Statistics do not\ninclude the category American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut, or the category Other,\nthe percentages of minorities calculated from the Block Statistics and cited\nbelow significantly understate the actual percentages.  For example in Tract 32\nthe tract data indicates that minorities are 42.2% of the population (Table 1).\nHowever, based on the Block Statistics which include only Black, Hispanic, and\nAsian and Pacific Islander, the percentage is 33.4.\n15. The South concentration encompasses contiguous  Tracts  1,2,3,4.5,\n6, 7, 12, and 14, and spills over into the contiguous Tracts 11 and 13. These\neleven tracts include 69.6% of the minority population of Providence.  If the all\nwhite portions of Tracts 11 and 13 are excluded, then this area of minority\nconcentration is nearly 54% minority.  If total population of all eleven tracts is\nincluded, then the area is 49.4% minority.\n16. The Northeast concentration is a compact area and includes all of\nTract 31, except the extreme southern portion, the western half of Tract 32,\nand the southwest corner of Tract 33.  It is generally bounded by Olney on the\nsouth, Hope on the east, Stenton on the north, and Route 1 on the west.\nHowever, a comparison to 1970 block data indicates that most contiguous blocks\non the eastern, and northern edges of this area area are in transition to minority\nconcentration.  This area contains  11.1% of the minority population.  Within this\narea of concentration minorities comprise 46.7%  (see note in 14 above) of the\npopulation.\n17. The Northwest concentration west of 1-95 is centered on two public\nhousing projects in Tract 27, Chad Brown and Admiral Terrace.  This area hae a\nvery irregular boundary and extends over portions of Tracts 25, 26, and 27. It\nis roughly bounded by Park on the south. Oaklawn, Maibone. and Douglas on the\nwest, Clym on the north, and 1-95 on the east.  Within the area a number of\nblocks are less than 20% minority, and the degree of minority concentration\ndoes not diminish steadily with increasing distance from the public housing\nprojects.  Block? with heavy concentrations of minorities are interspersed with\nconcentrated blocks.\n\n1S. The data clearly suggests that the portion of this area south of the\npublic housing projects in Tracts 25 and 26 is in transition to greater density of\nminority concentration.  This area contains 5.7% of the city's minority\npopulation, and within this area minorities comprise 23.1 % (see note in 14\nabove) of the population.  Despite the relatively low \\e\\ei  of minority\nconcentration in this area, it is striking  by contrast with the surrounding Tracts\n22,23. 24, 28, and 29. which range from  1.8% to 5.6% minority, and taken as a\nwhole are 2.7% minority.\n19. In the few census tracts in Providence whose minority percentage\napproximates that of the city, and which are not on the edges of the larger areas\nof minority concentration described above, examination of the Block Statistics\nshows that  minorities are not dispersed among the population in those tracts,\nbut live in small enclaves in public housing projects or university housing. In\n1980 such enclaves were to be found in Census Tracts  18, 20, 28, and 36.\n20. In Tract 18, which was 15.6% minority in 1980, and contained 2.6% of\nthe City's minority population, 91.1% of all minorities in the tract lived in the\nHartford Park public housing project.  Without the minority population of\nHartford Park minorities would comprise L6% of the population of Tract 18.\n21. In Tract 20, which was 20% minority in 1980. and contained  1,9% of\nthe City's minority population, 96.1% of the minorities in the Tract lived in the\nManton Heights public housing project or in the block immediately adjacent to\nit.  If we exclude only the minority residents of Manton Heights, minorities\nwould comprise 2.9% of the population of Tract 20,\n22. In Tract 28, which was 5.6% minority in 1980, and contained .8% of\nthe City's minority population, 51.5% of the minorities in the Tract lived in the\nValley View housing project operated by the PHA.  Without the minority\npopulation of Valley View minorities would comprise  1.9% of the population of\nTract 28.  The sale and conversion of  144 of the project's  256 units to non-\nsubsidized housing reduced the opportunities for low income  minority\nhouseholds to live in Tract 28 by 56.2%.\n\nTEL:  l-40i-:7:-5T35\n23. In Tract 36, which was  11.8% minority in 1980,and contained 2.8% of\nthe City's minority population, 70.4% of the minorities in the Trart lived in 9 of\nthe Tract's 94 blocks, clustered in around the campus of Brown University. In\nail probability, a significant  proportion of the residents of this tract, both\nminority and non-minority, are students at Brown University who are not\npermanent residents of Providence.\nThe Loss of Family Public Housing Units in Providence\n24. The current controversy over the location of replacement units for\nthose demolished at Hartford Park can best be understood in the context of\noverall changes that have been made by the PHA in the numbers and\ndistribution of family and elderly public housing units, and the changes in the\nracial composition of public housing that have taken place.\n25.  As of 1976 the PHA operated 13 public housing projects with a total\nof 3,405 units (Ex. \"G\", p. 28). Of these 6 were family projects, six were elderly\nprojects, and one, Hartford Park contained btrth family and elderly units (/d).\n26.  As originally built these 13 projects contained 3,473 housing units of\nwhich 2,295 were family and 1,178 were elderly (id., and Ex. \"H\", pp. 8,9).\nHartford Park had 512 family units and 236 elderly units for a total of 748.\n27. By 1976,68 family units at Roger Williams had been deprogrammed,\nand 240 family units at Hartford Park had been converted to elderly units,\nreducing the total number of family units by 308 to l,987(Eihibit \"G\", p.28).\n28. By January, 1983, 207 family units at Chad Brown, 180 family  units\nat Admiral Terrace, and an additional 552 family units at Roger Williams had\nbeen deprogrammed, further  reducing the total number of family by 939 units\nto 1.048, or 45.7% of the original number (Ids\n29. Between  1983 and 1988, 82 family  units at Codding Court and 50\nunits at Manton Heights have been converted to elderly units, and 186 units at\nChad Brown and Admiral terrace have been restored to family use leaving a\ncurrent loial of 1,102 family  units (AR: 3). or 48% of the original number\n\n30. A review of trends in minority occupancy of family public housing\nNw/  units in Providence reveals that the elimination of family housing units by the\nPHA followed significant increases in  the percentage of minority occupancy of\nfamily projects, particularly those such as Hartford Park and Manton Heights,\nwhich had been overwhelmingly white (Exhibit \"G\", pp. 8-14).\n31. While not, strictly speaking, public housing, and therefor  not included\nin the figures above, the Valley View  project, in Census Tract 28, was,\nnevertheless, a significant source of affordable  housing for low income minority\nfamilies in an overwhelmingly white area of Providence. That project, built as\nveterans housing after World War II. was owned and and operated as low rent\nhousing by the PHA.  The sale and conversion to non-subsidized housing of 144\nof the 256 units of the Valley View project during the  1980's further  reduced\nboth the supply of affordable  housing, and the number of opportunities for low\nincome minority families to live outside areas of minority concentration.\n32. As a result of these reductions in the numbers of affordable  family\nhousing units there has been a net loss of 434 family housing units in public\nhousing projects in locations that provided opportunities for low income\nminority famililies to live outside areas of minority concentration, 240 at\nHartford Park in Census Tract  18, 144 at Valley View in Census Tract 28, and 50\nat Manton Heights in Census Tract 20.\n33- Since 1954, except for the 240 unit scattered site project, which is the\nsubject of this controversy, the PHA has built only 12 family public housing\nunits.  All 12, built in 1989, are located in areas of minority concentration, 4 in\nTract 25. and 8 in Tract 6 (AR: 4).  Approval of these sites by HUD was\nconditioned on their inclusion in the larger scattered site project to be balanced\nby sites outside areas of minority concentration under the \"sufficient  and\ncomparable\" provisions of HUDs site selection policies.  This has not been done.\nThe addresses of these  12 sites do not appear in AR: 1,  AR: 2. or  in Exhibit \"B\"\n34. The PHA, has eliminated  1193 family public housing units, or 52% of\nthe total (excluding Valley View), and having undertaken to provide a total of\n120 new family  public housing units outside areas of minority concentration\nsince  19^4. has clearly not taken steos to provide, \"...sufficient,  cornpar-r-.:-:-\n\niEF-.-'ICEi  \"EL : l-^0i--7:-:  :'~5  Apr\nopportunities  for  minority families, in the income range to be served by the\nproposed project, outside areas of minority concentration...\" (24 CFR 941.202 and\nHUD H-81-2), nor have any steps been taken by HUD to require the PHA to do\nso.\nMinority Composition of the Hartford Park Project. Public Housing in Providence,\nand the Waiting List for Public Housing\n35. In  1987. prior to the demolition of 240 of the public housing units in\nthe Hartford Park project, 71 % of the units at that projectVere occupied by\nminorities (Exhibit \"F\" at Exhibit 4).  The demolition of those 240 units  reduced\nthe opportunities for low income minority households to live in overwhelmingly\nwhite Tract  18 by nearly a third.\n36.  The 29% white occupancy at the Hartford Park project prior to\ndemolition was the highest percent white for any of the PHA's four  family\nprojects (/#).  As a result Hartford Park was the most integrated of the PHA's\nfamily projects (Exhibit \"G\", p. 8).\n37. In  1987, prior to the demolition of 240 of the public housing units of\nthe Hartford Park project, 77% of all units in the PHA\"s family public housing\nprojects were occupied by minorities [Jd).\n38. As of 4 October, 1990, minorities comprised 78.9% of those on the\nPHA waiting list for public housing (Exhibit \"C, p. 9).  Moreover, 87% of those on\nthe waiting, list at that time, for 3, 4, or 5 bedroom units were minorities i/aO.\n39. According to the  1980 Census, the proportions of families, by sub-\ngroups within the population, with incomes below the poverty level in\nProvidence are as follows:  White, 11.5%; Black, 337%; Hispanic, 31.8%;\nAsian. 34.5%: and American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut, 39.1 %. These figures\nindicate that the rate of dependency on public housing for affordable  housing is\nat least three limes as great for  minorities as it is for whites.\n\nThe Hartford  Park Deoipl;jtjpns and the Locations of Scattered Site Replacement\nUnits: The Effects on Segregation in Providence\n40. As indicated above the Hartford Park project provided one of only a\nfew opportunities, in Providence, for low income minority households to live in\nmajority white surroundings.  In addition the project itself was the most racially\nintegrated of the PHA's family housing projects (Exhibit \"F\").\n41. Since the demolitions at Hartford Park eliminated 240 opportunities\nfor low income minority households to live in predominantly white\nsurroundings, any proposal for replacement housing that tocates fewer than 240\nunits in predominantly white surroundings will increase the level of minority\nsegregation in Providence.\n42. As of 30 November  1990,  the locations of 208 of the 240 scattered\nsite replacement units had been identified by the PHA . The sites for 32 units\nremained to be identified and approved (Exhibit \"B\" and Table 2).\n43- The sites that have been identified by the PHA have been numbered\nsequentially in the table appended to Eihibit'B\", and their locations have been\nexamined in relation the areas of minority concentration in Providence\ndescribed in paragraphs  11 - 23 above.\n44. Based on the use of  1980 Census Tract data alone, it would appear\nthat  107, or 514%,  of the 208 units that have been identified by the PHA, are\nlocated outside tracts whose level of minority concentration exceeds that of the\nCity as a whole.  However, when the locations of these sites are examined in\nrelation to the areas of minority concentration described in paragraphs  11 - 23\nas revealed by thel980 Census Block Statistics, it is clear that only 76, or 36.5%,\nare outside actual areas of minority concentration.\n45. The 36 units proposed by the PHA for Tract 26 is the largest number\nof units proposed for any single tract in Providence. Because the percent\nminority in Tract 26 in  1980 was 20.6%, .8% lower than the overall percent\nminority for the City, the 36 units proposed for Tract 26 were designated as\nunits located outside areas of minority concentration.\n\n-40  l-ZTLSZZZ\nTEL\n46. Eicept for the sites at 98 Chad Brown (2 units) and  15 Dome (2 units),\nall of the 36 units proposed by the PHA in Census Tract 26 are either in, or\ncontiguous eitensions of, the Northwest area of minority concentration (Exhibit\n\"B\" and Table 2).\n47. Of the 36 units proposed by the PHA for Tract 26, 21 have received\nfinal approval from HUD (Exhibits \"B\", \"I\", and \"J\")\n48. Despite their location within or directly contiguous to the Northwest\narea of concentration, the sites for the 21 units in Tract 26 were submitted by\nPHA and approved by HUD as sites outside areas of minority concentration.\n49. Of the 36 units proposed by PHA for Tract 26, 14 have been\ncompleted and occupied, and 7 are in various stages of construction (Table 2),\nincluding 3 units on Derry Street that have not yet received final approval from\nHUD. Of the remaining  15. one is awaiting (as of 30 November, 1990) the\ncommencement of site work and  14 are in various stages of processing by the\nPHA and HUD (Table 2).\n*\"\"/  50. The addition of such a large number of public housing units to a\ngrowing area of minority concentration such as the Northwest concentration,\nwith 384 existing public housing units in Chad Brown and Admiral Terrace, will\nsignificantly increase the level of Jow income minority concentration in that\narea, reinforce its image as an area of minority concentration, and accelerate the\nrate at which the concentration will grow.\n51. Of the 60 units on which construction had been completed by 30\nNovember, 1990. 54, or 90%, are located in areas of minority concentration\n52. Of the 54 units that were under construction as of 30 November,\n1990, 33, or 61.1%, are located in areas of minority concentration\n53. Given  the fact that the overwhelming  majority (87%) of those on the\nwaiting list for family public housing are minority, the early construction of 90%\nof the new scattered site units in areas of minority concentration impacts\nminorities disproportionately by restricting their choices to those areas of\nminority concentration, and increases the probability that the much smaller\n\nproportion of whites on the waiting list will gain access to the units built later\noutside the areas of minority concentration.\nConclusions and Opinion\n54.  From the above findings it is clear that the past actions of the PHA\nhave massively reduced the number of family public housing units in\nProvidence, and that this reduction has coincided with the growth of minority\npopulation in Providence and their increasing need for public housing.\n55.  Over a third of the units eliminated provided Opportunities for\nminority families to live in predominantly white areas of providence.\n56.  The current proposals, if implemented, would further reduce the\nopportunities for low income minority families to live in integrated areas,\nincrease the level of minority concentration in existing areas of minority\nconcentration, reinforce the identity of areas of minority concentration,\naccelerate the rate at which the level of minority concentration increases, and\nincrease the level of segregation in public housing.",

No. 89-248P\n)\nCITY OF PROVIDENCE, et al.  )\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nPETTINE, Senior Judge\nThe challenge to the decisions and actions taken by the\ndefendants in siting a shelter for homeless persons in the City\nof Providence is now before this Court. In an Order issued on\nJuly 17, 1989, this issue was severed from the other claims of\nplaintiff, Project B.Ã.S.I.C, that dealt with the planned\ndemolition of and scattered site plans for public housing; those\nclaims were disposed of in the July Order. Because of the\nseverance, the only defendants on this remaining claim are the\nCity of Providence  (City), the Providence Community Action\nProgram (Pro-CAP), Stephen J. O'Rourke in his official capacity\nas Executive Director of the Housing Authority of the City of\nProvidence, and the Housing Authority of the City of Providence\n(PHA).\nBefore severance, Pro-CAP filed a motion to dismiss pursuant\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. l2(b)(6). Pro-CAP argued that the plaintiff\ndid not have standing to bring this action and failed to state a\nclaim under which relief can be granted; further, the defendant\nstated that this Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear\nthe claim. Project B.Ã.S.I.C. objected to this motion. In the\n1\n\nJuly 17 Order severing this claim, the Court ordered the\nplaintiff to \"submit a memorandum of law [on this issue] on\nSeptember Í5, 1989, which must include specific allegations as to\nwhich statutes it believes have been violated. Defendants in this\ncause of action, the City of Providence and the Providence\nCommunity Action Program, should submit any reply memoranda by\nSeptember 29, 1989.\" Opinion and Order, Project B.A.S.I.c. v.\nJack F. Kemp et al. . July 17, 1989, at 34.` After time\nextensions, the memoranda were filed. However, none of the\ndefendants responded to the substance of the plaintiff's\nmemorandum, instead each filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. l2(b)(l).2 The defendants urge that the claims of the\nplaintiff either are not ripe for adjudication or are moot\nbecause of recent actions by the Board of Directors of Pro-CAP.\nThe Court is prepared to rule on all motions before it. For\nthe reasons set forth below, all motions of the defendants are\ndenied.\nI.\n1  The  Order  inadvertently  failed  to  name  the  Providence\nHousing Authority as one of the defendants in this cause of action.\nHowever, the PHA surely knew it was a defendant—it was served with\nthe  Complaint  and  has  filed  a motion  to dismiss  the homeless\nshelter  claim.  In  any  event,  for  the  purposes  of  the  motions\npresently  before  this Court, there  is no prejudice  to the PHA\nbecause  it  has  not  filed  an  answer  to  Project  B.A.S.I.C.'s\nsupplemental memorandum of law. The PHA has had an opportunity to\nbrief  the  Court  on  the  motions  decided  today  in  which  it  is\ndirectly affected.\n2 These motions are more correctly identified as motions under\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) as all pleadings in this case are closed.\n\nto the Hartford Park public housing project. The Mayor admitted\nthat the City and Pro-CAP were using a technicality to get out of\nthe purchase and sale agreement for the Broad Street building.\nThe technicality involved a City zoning ordinance on parking\nrequirements that would not have been met at the Broad Street\nsite.\nThe plaintiff asserts that the City, Pro-CAP, and the PHA\ncapitulated to racially motivated opposition when the site of the\nshelter was moved from Broad Street to Hartford Park. The move\ncaused delays in the opening of the shelter and resulted in the\nloss of grant money that was available for the Broad Street\nshelter, but is not now available for the Hartford Park site.\nThe plaintiff claims that the defendants, in allowing\nracially motivated opposition to play a part in their\ndecisionmaking, have violated federal law. Specifically, the\nplaintiff claims that the City and the PHA have violated the\nplaintiff's rights as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, the\nFair Housing Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964. Defendant Pro-CAP is claimed to have\nviolated the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The plaintiff, who is\nalleging injury, describes itself as \"an unincorporated\nassociation of tenants and advocates, active in a wide range of\nhousing and other issues affecting the low-income and minority\ncommunity, both in Providence and throughout the State of Rhode\nIsland. One of its components is the Project B.A.S.I.C. Tenants\nUnion, which focuses particularly on housing issues. Project\n\nB.A.S.I.C. devotes much of its resources to expanding and\npreserving low income housing and extending the ranges of choices\nthat are available to minority tenants, i.e. opening up areas of\nthe City of Providence and the State of Rhode Island which do not\npresently have housing opportunities for minority and low income\nfamilies.\" Complaint at para. 3. The plaintiff claims that the\ndefendant's actions have injured it by contributing to the lack\nof affordable housing in Providence and its metropolitan area, by\nfostering continued racial opposition to low income housing in\ncertain areas, and by impeding the efforts of the plaintiff to\nmake a greater supply and range of choice in affordable housing\navailable.\nII.\nThe defendants have challenged the Court's subject matter\njurisdiction by asserting that the case is either no longer ripe\nfor adjudication or is moot. The challenges arise from actions\ntaken at Pro-CAP's Board of Directors' meeting on October 4,\n1989. At that meeting, the board decided that an \"Ad Hoc\nCommittee of the Board be appointed for the purpose of reviewing\nthe actions already taken to develop [the homeless shelter] and\noffer other recommendations.\" Memorandum in Support of Providence\nCommunity Action Program, Inc.'s Motion To Dismiss, attachment\n(Minutes of Board of Directors Meeting). Each defendant asserts\nthat this means Pro-CAP has agreed to reconsider locations for\nthe shelter, including the original Broad Street site.\n\nDefendants City and Pro-CAP argue that this reconsideration\nby Pro-CAP's Board of Directors renders the controversy moot as\nno actual dispute now exists. Although the briefs from the\ndefendants on this point are sparse, their argument appears to\nrest on the following scenario: because the plaintiff says the\ndecision to build a shelter in Hartford Park as opposed to\nrenovating the Broad Street building is violative of the law, the\nlaw is no longer being violated because there is no longer a firm\ndecision about the location of the shelter. This argument has two\nfatal flaws.\nFirst, the argument assumes that the decision to build at\nHartford Park has been rescinded; this Court does not read the\nminutes of the Board of Directors meeting as saying any such\nthing. The fact that the board may do something in the future has\nlittle force with this Court. This situation is even more tenuous\nthan that in cases where courts have refused to consider a\nvoluntary cessation of challenged actions as mooting the case. In\nthose cases, the courts have reasoned that the case is not noot\nbecause the defendant  is free to return to his old ways. See\nUnited States v. W.T. Grant. 345 U.S. 629  (1953). In this case,\nthe defendant has not even changed from his old ways yet.\nSecond, the defendants' arguments oversimplify the\nplaintiff's claims. They  ignore the fact that even a definite\ndecision to return to the Broad Street site would not eradicate\nthe effects of the defendants' previous actions. The gravamen of\nthe Complaint is the claimed capitulation to racial pressure and\n\nthe damage brought on by the capitulation—these would not be\nmooted by th· defendants1 return to their original plan.4 This\nCourt is further concerned that defendants' recent decision to\nreconsider the shelter site may have been influenced by this\nsuit. If that is so, a finding that the case is now moot could\nencourage entities like defendants to disregard discrimination\nlaws when making a decision because that decision, and liability\nfor that decision, can always be set aside if a lawsuit is filed.\nThis case is also ripe for adjudication. The dispute has\ncrystallized and the legal questions are not hypothetical. The\nalleged capitulation to racially motivated opposition has taken\nplace. A future decision by the Board of Directors of Pro-CAP to.\nrehabilitate the Broad Street site (or other site acceptable to\nProject B.A.S.I.C.) will not eviscerate the claimed damage—this\nwas the result of the capitulation. If the plaintiff is able to\nprove its allegations, even a return to the Broad Street site\nwould not change that fact that the defendants' earlier actions\ncontributed to the lack of affordable housing, fostered continued\nracial opposition to low income housing, and harmed plaintiff's\nefforts to make available a greater supply and choice of\naffordable housing. The legal issue is still whether defendants'\nactions in altering the site for the shelter were a violation of\n4 Certainly, some of the remedies requested by the plaintiff\nwould be unnecessary  if the plaintiff prevails and the defendant\nhas  opened  the  shelter  at  the  Broad  Street  site  (i.e.,  an\ninjunction ordering Pro-CAP to rescind its siting decision). Other\nrequested remedies would still be appropriate (i.e., an injunction\nordering the defendants to restore forfeited funds).\n\nthe law. If the defendants decide to rehabilitate the Broad\nStreet site, they would certainly mitigate any potential damage\nfinding; however, that action would not erase the alleged harm of\nthe first action. That harm is certainly ripe for adjudication.\nIII.\nPro-CAP further challenges Project B.A.S.I.C.'s Complaint by\narguing that Project B.A.S.I.C. lacks standing and has failed to\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.5 Neither of these\nchallenges can withstand scrutiny.\nA.\nIn challenging Project B.A.S.I.C.•s standing to bring this\nComplaint, Pro-CAP asserts that the Complaint fails to say how\nits acts resulted in injury to Project B.A.S.I.C. or Project\nB.A.S.I.C.•s members. It is unnecessary for Project B.A.S.I.C. to\nassert injury to both itself and to its members; an organization\n5 Pro-CAP also argues that this Court lacks subject natter\njurisdiction over the claim. Pro-CAP asserts that it never acted\nunder color of state law and that it exercised  its authority in\ngood  faith and under an objectively  reasonable belief that its\ndecisions  regarding  the  location  of  the  shelter  for  homeless\npersons  were  lawful.  Pro-CAP  correctly  states  that  Project\nB.A.S.I.C. has claimed  jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n1343(3), but then goes on to argue extensively that there can be\nno jurisdiction because § 1343(3) requires the defendant to have\nacted under color of state law. Pro-CAP seems to have forgotten\nabout § 1331, which only requires that there be a federal question.\nPro-CAP's  actions  are  being  challenged  under  the  federal  Fair\nHousing Act; and this Act reaches private as well as public actors.\nFurther, Pro-CAP1s assertion of good faith is not a consideration\nfor a motion to dismiss. It is simply an affirmative defense that\nhas nothing to do with the standing doctrine. See Gomez v. Toledo,\n446 U.S. 635, 640-41  (1980); Pierson v. Rav. 386 U.S. 547, 557\n(1967) .\n8\n\ncan sue on its own behalf if it can allege the requisite injury.\nSee Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development c.nrp. ,\n429 U.S. 252, 261 (1977); Havens Realty Corporation v. Col·eman\nr\n455 U.S. 363, 378-79  (1982). Project B.A.S.I.C. has clearly\nstated an institutional injury in its Complaint at paragraph 9:\nThe defendants' actions in regard to the shelter...\nhave... contributed, and continue to contribute to the\nlack of affordable open housing throughout the City of\nProvidence and surrounding metropolitan area....\nFurther, these same actions have fostered continued\nracial opposition to low income housing in certain\nareas, and have directly harmed the efforts of\nplaintiff to make available a greater supply, and a\ngreater range of choice, in the affordable housing\nstock.\nThis asserted injury is linked to other paragraphs in the\nComplaint that describe the actions of the defendants, actions\nthat the plaintiff claims were influenced by considerations of\nrace and that caused delay in availability of housing and loss of\noperating funds. See Complaint para. 83, 87, 88. Certainly, if\nPro-CAP had gone ahead with the Broad Street rehabilitation, a\nshelter would have opened sooner and some grant monies for the\nshelter would not have been lost.\nPro-CAP has further argued that no actual injury has\noccurred because the shelter for homeless persons is to be\nconstructed at another location. However, the wrongdoing claimed\nby the plaintiff was not the relocation of to Hartford Park, it\nwas the capitulation to racial pressures when deciding to\nrelocate. The injuries stem from that capitulation. Besides the\nactual injuries Project B.A.S.I.C. claims (see supra), the\nComplaint can be read as relying on a more elusive, although as\n9\n\nconstitutionally viable, injury· The policy behind the Fair\nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq.. is that there be \"fair\nhousing throughout the United States.\" 42 U.S.C. § 3601. Congress\nintended this Act to put an end to all manner of discrimination\nin housing, whether it be subtle or blatant. See United States v.\nCitv of Black Jack. 508 F.2d 1179 (8th Cir. 1974); United States\nv. City of Parma. 494 F. Supp. 1049, 1053 (N.D. Ohio 1980), aff'd\n661 F.2d 562, reh'q denied 669 F.2d 1100, cert, denied 456 U.S.\n926, reh'g denied 456 U.S. 1012. By establishing the right to be\nfree from discrimination in housing decisions, the Fair Housing\nAct creates standing for a plaintiff when this right has been\ninvaded to plaintiff's detriment. See Warth v. Seldin. 422 U.S.\n490, 500 (1975); Linda R.S. v. Richard P.. 410 U.S. 614, 617, n.3\n(1973). If Pro-CAP based its decision to abandon the Broad Street\nsite on race, or even partially on race, or even on citizens'\nfears of \"white flight\" from the neighborhood, Project B.A.S.I.C.\nhas stated a injury sufficient to withstand constitutional\nchallenge. See United States v. Starrett City Associates. 340\nF.2d 1096, 1102 (2d Cir. 1988), cert, denied 109 S.Ct. 376 (the\nwhite flight phenomenon cannot justify attempts to maintain\nintegration through inflexible racial quotas); Marabl·e v. H.\nWalker & Associates. 644 F.2d 390, 395 (5th cir. 1981)(it is\nsufficient that race was one significant factor considered by\ndefendant); Citv of Parma, 494 F. Supp. at 1054 (Fair Housing Act\nis violated if race was one of the motivating factors behind\nchallenged conduct).\n10\n\nFurther, Project B.A.S.I.C.'s injuries are likely to be\nredressed at least partially by the requested relief. The\nrequested: injunction ordering the shelter to be established at\nthe Broad Street site, or some other acceptable location, would\nfree the shelter location from the stigma of racial\ndiscrimination. The plaintiff also asks that the defendants be\nordered to restore funds lost to the shelter because of the\ndefendants' illegal acts. Restoration of the funds would\ncertainly aid the plaintiff's goal of providing affordable\nhousing to low-income persons.\nThe three prongs of the constitutional standing test have\nbeen satisfied. Project B.A.S.I.C. has alleged that it has\nsuffered a personal injury, that the injury is fairly traceable\nto Pro-CAP's alleged illegal actions, and that the injury is\nLikely to be redressed by the requested relief. These are the\nsole standing requirements under the Fair Housing Act. See Havens\nRealty Corp.. 455 U.S. at 372.\nB.\nDefendant Pro-CAP also asserts that the Complaint has failed\nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Several of the\npoints raised here by Pro-CAP have been discussed and ruled on in\nthe above discussion on standing; those points will not be\nrehashed.6 The points that will be discussed are Pro-CAP's claim\nthat the Complaint has not set forth a recognized theory upon\n6 In  particular,  Pro-CAP  states  that  Project  B.A.S.I.C.\nalleges no injuries caused by Pro-CAP and that the Complaint does\nnot clearly set forth the grounds on which it is basing its claim.\n11\n\nwhich relief can be granted and, a closely related point, Pro-\nCAP·s belief that no basis has been shown that establishes that\nPro-CAP violated the federal government's policy of fair housing.\nThis Court concedes that Project B.A.S.I.C.'s Complaint is\nnot a model for clarity and precision. However, once the\nComplaint material dealing with the demolition of and scattered\nsite plans for public housing is eliminated, the issues\nsurrounding the homeless shelter are revealed in a brighter\nlight. Project B.A.S.I.C. is clearly claiming that Pro-CAP·s\ndecision to relocate the shelter from the Broad Street site to\nHartford Park violated the Fair Housing Act. See Complaint at\npara. 1. The reasons behind the plaintiff's claim that this\naction is illegal are somewhat shrouded. In its \"Shelter\"\nsection, the Complaint indiscriminately sets forth the damages\ncaused by the defendant's action, evidence that any claimed\nlegitimate reasons for defendant's actions are only a facade,\nevidence that illegal factors played a role in defendant's\nactions, and general background information. However, a careful\nreading of that section (para. 81-91) in conjunction with the\n\"Causes of Action\" section (para. 92-107) should have alerted\nPro-CAP to Project B.A.S.I.C.'s claim that Pro-CAP's actions were\nillegal because they were influenced by racial considerations. In\nthree of the eleven paragraphs specifically on the homeless\nshelter, race is alleged to have played a role in the relocation\n(para. 83, 88, 91). The actual statement of the cause of action\n12\n\nagainst Pro-CAP does not mention race specifically/ but from the\nearlier paragraphs of the Complaint, it is clear that the\n\"community and political opposition\" Pro-CAP allegedly allowed to\ninfluence its action is opposition that stemmed at least in part\nfrom racial discrimination.\nPro-CAP challenges the sufficiency of these allegations to\nestablish a violation of the Fair Housing Act. In its memorandum,\nProject B.A.S.I.C. specifies the section of the Fair Housing Act\nthat it believes Pro-CAP has violated. See Plaintiff's\nSupplemental Memorandum at 9-11. That section, 42 U.S.C. §\n36O4(a), makes it unlawful \"[t]o refuse to sell or rent after\nmaking of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the\nsale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a\ndwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin.\" This section has been interpreted as\nprohibiting all practices that have the effect of making housing\nmore difficult to obtain on prohibited grounds. See City of\nParna, 494 F. Supp. at 1053. Project B.A.S.I.C. fits its claims\ninto this broad prohibition by claiming that Pro-CAP's surrender\nto racially motivated pressure from citizen groups has made\nhousing for the homeless (who are disproportionately minorities)\n7 The cause of action against Pro-CAP is phrased as follows:\nDefendant Pro-CAP, by allowing community and political\nopposition to the prospective residents of its proposed\nshelter  to  in part guide  its decision  to change  the\nshelter's location from Broad Street to Hartford Park,\nand to delay the opening of the shelter, has violated\nplaintiff's rights under the Fair Housing Act of 1968,\n42 U.S.C. §3601 et seq.\nComplaint, para. 107.\n13\n\nL·\nunavailable in the Broad Street area and unavailable in general\nbecause of the delays the relocation caused. Project B.A.S.I.c.\nis claiming that this pressure is the prohibited grounds.\nIt is true that the plaintiff's case rests on a chain of\nevents and the absence of any one event could destroy Project\nB.A.S.I.C.•s case. Racial discrimination must have played a role\nin the community opposition to the shelter on Broad Street, and\nthis pressure must have been a motivating force in Pro-CAP's\nrelocation decision. This may also be a difficult case for the\nplaintiff because the actions and motivations ascribed to the\ncitizens pressuring Pro-CAP are not blatantly heinous. These\ncitizens are not trying to keep their neighborhood lily white,\nand they have shown that they are willing to accept other\nshelters in their neighborhood. Compare, e.g.. Huntinqton Branch.\nNAACP v. Town of Huntinqton. 844 F.2d 926 (2d Cir. 1988), aff'd\n109 S.Ct. 276; Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo. 567 F.2d 126 (3d\nCir.  1977), cert, denied 435 U.S. 908; City of Parma. 494 F.\nSupp. 1049.\nHowever, the Fair Housing Act does not require heinous\nintention for a finding of liability. It can cover situations in\nwhich the defendant's actions are not themselves racially\nmotivated, but simply have a disparate impact on minorities or\nare inspired by others whose motivations are not free from racial\nbias. In Rizzo. 564 F.2d at 149 (1977), the court ruled that a\nprima facie violation of the Fair Housing Act was established\nwhen the plaintiff produced evidence that \"the urban renewal\n14\n\nactivities of the defendants had the result of removing black\nfamilies from [the renewal area], leaving [the area] as an all-\nwhite community.\"8 Although in Rizzo there was evidence of\n-discriminatory intent, the Third Circuit did not rest its\ndetermination on this intent. It was enough that what the\ndefendants had done had a disproportionate impact on black\npersons in one area of Philadelphia. In Rizzo and in this case,\nthe plaintiff claims a violation of the Fair Housing Act because\nhousing is made unavailable to minorities by the acts of\ndefendants. Rizzo has other parallels with our case in that the\nRizzo defendants changed their decisions about a project that\nwould house a disproportionate number of minority families when\nstrong community opposition arose. In regard to that situation,\nthe Third Circuit wrote: \"While this [situation] provides no\ndirect evidence of discriminatory purpose on the City's part, the\ncircumstances of a sudden shift in the City's position from\npassive acceptance to active opposition, in the face of protests\nThe First Circuit has not resolved the issue of whether the\nFair Housing Act requires discriminatory intent be present before\nthere  is a violation of the Act. Latinos Unidos de Chelsea en\nAccion v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 799 F.2d 774,\n791  (1st  Cir.  1986).  However,  this  Court  is persuaded  by  the\nanalyses of other circuits that have accepted discriminatory impact\nas establishing a violation of the Act. Those circuits have noted\nthe parallels between Title VII (the Equal Employment Opportunities\nAct)  and  Title  VIII  (the  Fair  Housing  Act)  and  cited  the\ncongressional  intent  that both  be construed  broadly.  Practical\nconcerns—the ease of concealing motivations and the importance for\nthe trial judge of the impact of the defendant's actions—have also\ndictated  the  circuits'  determinations.  See,  e.g..  Huntington\nBranch. NAACP. 844 F.2d 926 (2d Cir. 1988); Rizzo. 564 F.2d 126 (3d\nCir.  1977); Metropolitan Housing Development Con?, v. Village of\nArlington Heights. 558 F.2d 1283 (7th Cir. 1977); Smith v. Anchor\nBuilding Corp.. 536 F.2d 231 (8th Cir. 1977).\n15\n\nby demonstrators manifesting racial bias, provides some\nindication of an improper motive or purpose.\" xâ·» at 144\n(footnote omitted).\nThus, the plaintiff's claim that Pro-CAP gave in to racially\nmotivated pressures when it decided to relocate the shelter does\nstate a recognized theory under the Fair Housing Act. The fact\nthat the shelter is to be established at another site does not\nrelieve Pro-CAP from its legal obligation to make housing\ndecisions free from racial bias.9 Pro-CAP argues that Congress\ndid not intend that the Fair Housing Act take away its\ndecisionmaking authority. As a general proposition, that is true,\nbut Congress did intend to eliminate any traces of racial\ndiscrimination within that decisionmaking authority.\n9  For  the  purposes  of  this  motion  to  dismiss,  Project\nB.A.S.I.C.·s allegation that Pro-CAP is a public actor is taken as\ntrue. However, if Pro-CAP•s assertion that it is a private entity\nis accurate, some novel questions of liability may be raised. The\nFair Housing  Act undoubtedly  reaches private persons; but most\ncases against private persons have dealt with refusals to rent or\nsell. In this case, Pro-CAP is accused of violating the Act because\nit  chose  to  locate  its  shelter—a  shelter  which  will  provide\nresidence for a disproportionate number of minorities—in one place\nrather than another. In the past, suits challenging the location,\nor lack of location, of housing have been against public entities.\nHowever, the issue of whether or not a private entity can be thus\nsued  is  not  before  the  Court  on  this  motion  to  dismiss. The\nplaintiff asserts that the City is officially involved with Pro-\nCAP and that Pro-CAP was at all times acting under color of state\nlaw. Complaint, para. 9. Further, the plaintiff has alleged that\na substantial portion of the funds that Pro-CAP will use to develop\nthe shelter are public funds. That fact certainly weighs in favor\nof holding Pro-CAP to the standard required of public entities when\nmaking location decisions under the Fair Housing Act.\n16\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, all motions of defendants\nare denied. The issue of the siting of the shelter for homeless\npersons is \"to be set down for trial on 24-hour notice on or after\nJune 4, 1990.\nEnter:\nDeputy ClerJr\nBy Order:\nWL/«  uV\nJudgeQ\nApril 25, 1990\n17",

The Housing Authority of the City of\nProvidence  (PHA) has failed to adequately maintain thes· units\nfor at least five years prior to th· filing of the demolition,\napplication*  Specifically, th· PHA failed to fill vacancies in\nthese unit* as they arose, thus enabling th· vacant units to\n\nbecome vandalized and occupied by unauthorized inhabitants and\"\nsubjectingtth· residents of Hartford Park to increased fire and\nsecurity risks and maintenance problems/  in this action\nplaintiff challenges the proposed demolition of 3 high-rise\nbuildings at Hartford Park which collectively contain 240 units\n(\"high-rises\"), and the proposed construction of replacement\nunits on unapproved \"scattered sites\" in the City of Providence,\nas violative of the United States Housing Act, the federal Fair\nHousing Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the United\nStates Constitution.  Plaintiff also challenges the decision\nchanging the siting of a shelter for the homeless by the\nProvidence Community Action Program (\"Pro-CAP\") from the Elmwood\nneighborhood of Providence to Hartford Park as violative of the\nfederal Fair Housing Act.\nII.  JURISDICTION\n2.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 51331\nand 28 U.S.C. §1343(3).\nIII.  PARTIES\n3.  Project B.A.S.I.C. is an unincorporated association of\ntenants and advocates, active in a wide range of housing and\nother issues affecting the low-income and minority community,\nboth in Providence and throughout the State of Rhode Island,  one\nof its components is the Project B.A.S.I.C. Tenants Union, which\nfocuses particularly on housing issues.\n\nProject B.A.S.I.C· devotes much of its resources to,\nexpandìn9reiMl preserving low income housing and extending the\nranges ot choices that are available to minority tenants*- i.e..\nopening up areas of the city of Providence and the State of Rhode-\nIsland which do not presently have housing opportunities for\nminority and low income families/  Project B.A.S.I.C. has been\nactive in opposing both the demolition of the high-rises at\nHartford Park and the manner in which the planning of the\nlocation of replacement units on scattered sites has not included\nlarge areas of the City of Providence.\n4.  Defendant Jack F. Kemp is the Secretary of the United-\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD).  Kemp\n(the Secretary) is responsible for the carrying out of all\nresponsibilities  imposed on the federal agency by Congress and\nthe Constitution.  In the context of demolition of the high-\nrises, these responsibilities arise particularly from the U.S.\nHousing Act, 42 u.s.c. §l437p, the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.3.c.\n§3608 and the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §4321.\nIn this complaint the term ••Secretary\" may include the present\nSecretary, Mr. Kemp, and his predecessor, Samuel Pierce.\n5.  The United States Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment. (HUD.) is an agency of the United States authorized\nand directed to carry out the responsibilities imposed by\nCongress and the Constitution.  See paragraph 4, sjiEia.  Its\nprincipal office is in Washington, D.C.\n6.  Stephen J. O·Rourke is the Executive Director of the\n\nHousing Authority of th· City of Provid·nc· (PHA)•  His offic· is\nlocated afe 100 Broad street, Providence, Rhode island  02903.  H·\nis charged-withcarrying out all legal obligations imposed on the\nPHA by th· U.S. Housing Act, Titl· VIII of th· Civil Rights Act\nof 1968, and other statutory mandates.  At all relevant times he\nhas acted under color of state law. *\n7.  WStki8mmkmt.Authority of the City of Providence (PHA)\nis a public housing authority as defined in 42 U.S.C. §1437, duly\ncreated pursuant to R.I.G.L. §45-25-1 et seq.  Its principal\noffice is located at 100 Broad Street, Providence, Rhode Island\n02903.  It owns and operates the Hartford Park public housing\nproject.  At all relevant times, the PHA has acted under color of\nstate law.\n8.  Tl·fe city of Providence (The Cityÿ is a municipality\ncreated pursuant to state law, which acts through, inter alia,\nits Mayor, its Redevelopment Authority and its Planning\nDepartment.  The City also has official involvement with the PHA,\nsee R.I.G.L. §45-25-1 et seq, although the PHA is also a separate\nlegal entity.  At all relevant times, the City has acted under\ncolor of state law:\n9.  35to«tøOKid·iM· Community Action Program  (Pro-CAP) is a\nduly incorporated entity, operating in the City of Providence,\nwhich, i¾tter alia, is funded to develop a shelter or shelters for\nhomeless persons and families within the City.  Its principal\noffice is located at 77 Washington Street, Providence, Rhode\nIsland  02903.  The City, as in th· case of the PHA, has official\n\ninvplvement vith Pro-CAP, through its Board of Directors.  At all\nrelevant timmu, Pro-CAP has acted under color of stat· law.\nIV. FACTS\nA.  DEMOLITION OF HARTFORD PARK HIGH-RISES\n10.  In 1986 th· PHA applied for $32,000,000 to modernize\nHartford Park through the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance\nProgram  (CIAP) for Fiscal Year 1986, administered by the Unit·d\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD).\nAccording to the \"Management Review Report and Improvement Plan\"\ndated April 27, 1987, commissioned by the PHA and prepared by The\nMcHenry Company Inc. (\"McHenry Report\"),  seø Appendix, at 1,7,\nHUD rejected this application for modernization funds for\nHartford Park, as the PHA lacked a satisfactory plan to assure\nthe continued viability of Hartford Park.\n11.  On March 20, 1987 the PHA submitted its Preliminary\nCIAP Application  for Fiscal Year 1987.  This application  included\nfunds in the amount of $5,740,390 for comprehensive and emergency\nmodernization of all high-rise units at Hartford Park.  The\napplication contained a certification from the PHA·s Executive\nDirector that \"the PHA has determined that the proposed  . . .\n(modernization  is financially feasible and will result in long\nterm physical and social viability at the project.\"  S3* Appendix\nat 17, 34-75  (bottom of each page).  Moreover, the PHA noted in\nit's cover letter that \"th· enclosed application is based on the\n\nassumption that the proposed comprehensive modernization of each\nproject will assure each project's long-term viability.\"  £ej|\nAppendix at 17.  The cover letter further stated that the PHA\n\"expects to subsequently amend this Preliminary Application to\npropose demolition of portions of Hartford Park as an alternative\nto modernization if it is determined that modernization will not\nassure its long term viability.\"  The Preliminary CIAP\napplication also described the PHA's modernization priorities.\nRegarding Hartford Park the PHA stated:  \"The buildings are\nstructurally sound, but, unless action is taken immediately to\narrest and reverse the deteriorization to the site, buildings and\nunits, and to improve the quality of life in the development,\nthis valuable housing resource will be lost to the low income\nresidents of Providence.11  Se¢ Appendix at 17, 19.\n12.  Prior to submitting the Preliminary CIAP Application,\nthe PHA notified the Tenant Association Presidents in a memo\ndated March 12, 1987, of the PHA·s intent to submit an\napplication under CIAP to obtain funds for modernization and\nmanagement improvements.  See Appendix at 76-77.  The notice did\nnot identify those projects to be modernized, nor was any mention\nof demolition of any public housing development mentioned in this\nnotice.\n13.  In response to newspaper articles discussing the\npossibility of demolishing the high-rise units at Hartford Park,\nplaintiff requested that the PHA and HUD (by letters of April 1,\n1987 to the PHA and April 2, 1987 to the Providence HUD office,\n\nrespectively, sjee. Appendix at 78 and 79) convene public hearings\non demolition of Hartford Park.  The PHA never replied to this\nrequest.  On April 8, 1987 HUD replied to plaintiff's letter, and\nindicated that it is the PHA·s responsibility to \"comply with the\nstatutory and other requirements for public notice and comment on\nsuch a proposal.1*  See Appendix at 80.\n14.  On April 10, 1987, th· PHA submitted to HUD an\napplication for development of 360 units of public housing to be\nbuilt on sites scattered throughout the City of Providenoe See\nAppendix at 81-107.  Attached to that application was a\n\"Statement of Intent to Make Application for the Demolition of\nPublic Housing Units'* which stated that the PHA would amend its\nCIAP application to \"specify the demolition of the four high-rise\nstructures as an alternative to their rehabilitation if it is\ndetermined that they would be non-viable even if rehabilitated1*.\nSee Appendix at 81, 105.  The statement also contained\ncertifications by the PHA's Executive Director that:\na.  \"(U)nless units proposed for demolition are replaced,\nthe Authority would have inadequate relocation resources for\ncurrent tenants . .\";' and\nb.  \"(B)oth as a relocation resource and as a substitution\nfor units lost as a result of demolition, housing vouchers\ncannot b· used in lieu of new construction due to an\ninsufficient supply of appropriate, available units within\nthe City of Providence.1*\n15.  Sometime in 1986 or early 1987, the PHA contracted\n\nwith th· McHenry Company  (McHenry) to assist the PHA in preparing\nits preliminary CIAP application.  On April 27, 1987 McHenry\nissued a report entitled \"Management Review Report and\nImprovement Plan:  The Providence Housing Authority\", in which\nthree options for the future of Hartford Park were identified:\na.  demolition of one or more of the high-rise buildings;\nb.  restoration of the development as is; or\nc.  sealing off the upper floors of the high-rises.\nSee Appendix at 1, 11.  McHenry did not make any recommendation\nfor the future use of Hartford Park, but noted that the PHA  must\n\"provide more secure lobby areas and increased management\npresence.\"\n16.  On June 3, 1987, the Board of Cominissioners of the PHA\npassed resolution number 3649, over the objection of plaintiff\nand the president of the Hartford Park Tenants Association. See\nAppendix at 108-09.  Resolution 3649 called for the demolition of\nthree out of four high-rise buildings containing a combined total\nof 240 units at Hartford Park.  The three high-rises buildings\nwere:\na.  12 Bodell Avenu· (90 units, all vacant as of 10/13/87)\nb.  375 Hartford Avenue (60 units, partially vacant)\nc.  22 Whelan Road  (90 units, partially vacant)\n17.  On Jun· 11, 1987 the PHA submitted a revised\nPreliminary CIAP Application for Fiscal Year 1987.  S_£fi Appendix\nat 110-138.  This revised  application included funds for the\nmodernization of all high-ris· units at Hartford Park.  In an\n8\n\nattachment to th· revised application entitled Project Viability\nTest, ttM*,IUk stated that the estimated modernization cost of\nrehabilitating the high-rise buildings at Hartford Park did not\nexceed the HUD established prototype cost limit by 40%.  sea\nAppendix at 116-17.  Further, the Project Viability Test stated\nthat the proposed modernization  (i.e. rehabilitation of the high-\nrises) would both (i) correct any physical deficiencies that\ncurrently render the high-rises obsolete as to physical\ncondition, and (ii) assure Hartford Park's long term viability,\ni.e. that it would be suitable for operation as public housing\nfor a period of at least 20 years.  Finally, in a cover letter\naccompanying the revised Preliminary CIAP application, the PHA\nstated that it expected to withdraw the portion of the revised\napplication pertaining to Hartford Park if the PHA's development\napplication for replacement scattered site units is approved.\nSee Appendix at 110.\n18.  On or about June 24, 1987 the PHA, by its Executive\nDirector, informed the Providence HUD office that \"the estimated\ncost of modernizing the three high-rise structures slated for\ndemolition/disposition exceeds the demolition costs by\n$2,380,146.  3A« Appendix at 139.  Based on the PHA·s request\nfor $2,079,000 on August 20, 1987 for demolishing three high-\nrises, the cost for modernizing the three high-rises was\n$4,459,146.\n19.  On or about July 1, 1987 plaintiff made a Request for\nInformation to the PHA regarding the Disposition of the Hartford\n\nPark high-rises.  £âA Appendix at 142.  Plaintiff requested\ncopies o£¯ *·ll documentation, feasibility studies and\ncorrespondence that indicates the social and physical unviability\n(sic) of the towers.\"  Plaintiff also restated its opposition to\nthe demolition of the high-rises, and again requested a public\nhearing before any final decision on the high-rises was made.\n20.  The PHA placed an advertisement in th· July 9, 1987\nissue of the Providence Journal soliciting \"letters of interest\nfrom non-profit and for profit organizations on the potential\nuse\" of 240 units at Hartford Park that PHA sought to demolish or\ndispose of.  See Appendix at 143.\n21.  In response to the advertisement placed by the PHA\nplaintiff sent a letter to the PHA on July 13, 1987, urging the\nPHA to only consider and approve those proposals received by the\nPHA in response to said advertisement which reclaim the high-rise\ntowers for their original use: public housing.  See Appendix at\n144.  Further, plaintiff made note of the lack of tenant\nparticipation in the demolition/disposition application proc···.\n22.  On July 16, 1987 the PHA replied to plaintiff's lett·r\nof July 13, and stated that the ••PHA doesn't have plans to\nrenovat· or reuse the (high-rise) buildings for our own use.\"\nSea Appendix at 145.  Further, the PHA noted that it disagreed\nwith plaintiff's contention that the PHA failed to follow the\nmandated tenant participation requirements.  Finally, the letter\nnoted that the replacement units for the demolished units at\nHartford Park \"will be designed with their neighborhood in aind\".\n10\n\n23.  Th· Hartford Park Tenants Association submitted a\nproposal tc* th· PHA regarding the use of the high-rise buildings\nat Hartford Park on August 26, 1987.  Sjaa Appendix at 146-157.\nFirst, the Tenants Association recommended that there be no\ndemolition of any high-rise buildings at Hartford Park due to the\n\"dire need for low income housing that now exists.\"\nAlternatively, the Tenants Association recommended that two of\nthe high-rise buildings be demolished  (12 Bode11 Avenue and 10\nWhelan Road), and that 30 replacement units b· constructed on the\nsite of each demolished building, totalling 60 units.  The second\nrecommendation was conditioned on a number of factors, including\nadequate tenant participation.\n24.  The PHA submitted its final application for the Major\nReconstruction of Hartford Park under CIAP on August 20, 1987.\nSee Appendix at 158-184.  The PHA sought funds in the amount of\n$16,647,595 for improvements to Hartford Park, including\n$2,079,000 for the demolition of three high-rise buildings.\n25.  After receiving the final application from the PHA, the\nHUD Field Office in Providence reviewed and recommended approval\nof the MROP application.  The recommendation was contained in an\nundated document entitled \"FY 1987 Development Funds for Major\nReconstruction of Obsolete Projects Review Sheet\" (MROP Project\nReview Sheet).  See Appendix at 185-86.  The recommendation  for\napproval was made despite the Field Office's finding contained in\nthe MROP Project Review Sheet that the PHA had minimal management\ncapability and minimal modernization capability.\n11\n\n26.  In an attachment to the MROP Project Review Sheet\nentitled \"Factors Contributing to Project Obsolescence1*, the HUD\nField Offioe> found that the high-rises were obsolete, due to the\ndesign of the units and the concentration of low income families\nthat would result from the renovation of the high-rises,  see\nAppendix at 185-187.  This finding contradicts the finding of a\n1984 design consultant referred to in the attachment, who found\nthat \"any approach to rehabilitation or reuse of the buildings\nwould have to presume only slight interior modifications to the\nunits due to their reinforced concrete construction\".  Further,\nthat consultant specifically recommended that the PHA not\ndemolish the high-rises at Hartford Park due to the unmet need\nfor subsidized units in Providence.\n27.  On or about September 10, 1987 the HUD Field Office\ninformed the PHA that funds in the amount of $16,700,000 were\nreserved for 508 units of public housing at Hartford Park under\nthe Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Projects  (MROP) program, a\ncomponent of CIAP.  See Appendix at 189-192.  On or about\nNovember 5, 1987, an amendment to the PHA's annual contribution\ncontract, providing $16,700,000 for modernization purposes, was\nexecuted by th& PHA and HUD.  Sfifi Appendix at 193.\n28.  The PHA Board of Commissioners met on September 24,\n1987 and approved Resolution No. 3672.  By this resolution, the\nPHA Board of Commissioners approved the PHA's application to\ndemolish three high-rise buildings at Hartford ParJc, but forbade\nthe PHA from commencing demolition of these buildings until the\n12\n\nPHA \"has received any and all n·c···ary funding and approval to\ncommence construction of an equivalent number of new, scattered\nsite, replacement units.\"  SSÄ Appendix at 194.\n29.  The PHA submitted an application to HUD for approval to\ndemolish three high-rise buildings at Hartford Park on September\n29, 1987.  See Appendix at 196-231.  Reversing its earlier\nposition, the PHA stated that it \"determined that a comprehensive\nprogram of modernization can not assure the long term viability\nof thre· of the Project's high-rise structures, 12 Bodell Avenue\n. ..  22 Whelan Road . . . and 375 Hartford Avenue.\"  See\nAppendix at 199.  The PHA justified the request for demolition\non the grounds that \"the three high-rise buildings are obsolete\nas to physical condition and other factors making them unusable\nfor public housing purposes\", citing 24 C.F.R. §970.6(a).  See\nAppendix at 199.  Further, the PHA stated that \"no reasonable\nprogram of modifications . ..  is (sic) feasible to return these\nportions of the project to useful life1*, citing 24 C.F.R.\n§§97O.6(b) and 968.  Id.  Further, the PHA stated that \"the\ndemolition of only parts of Hartford Park will help assure the\nuseful life of the remaining portions of the project  (i.e. it\nwill reduc· project density and substantially reduce the\nproject's overall vacancy rate).1*  See Appendix at 200.\n30.  On or about November 27, 1987 the HUD Field Office made\na written reply to the demolition application submitted by the\nPHA on September 29, 1987.  S33. Appendix at 232-34.  The HUD\nField Office determined that the application did not meet the\n13\n\nrequirements of 24 C.F.R. 1970 and the HUD Handbook.\nSpecifically, the HUD Field Office noted that:\na.  Th· PHA·s statement justifying demolition was\n\"inadequate11, and that the only \"possible\" demolition\ncriteria set forth in 24 C.F.R. §970.6 that the proposal\nfalls under is 24 C.F.R. §970.6(e) (Note; In that there is\nno such section, HUD probably meant §970.6(c), relating to\nassuring useful life of the project);\nb.  The PHA's comments on relocation were not \"specific or\nadequate\", and questioned \"(w)here are the (relocated)\ntenants going?\";\nc.  The PHA's description of tenant consultation \"doe· not\nappear\" to meet the requirements of 24 C.F.R. §970 and the\nHUD Handbook; and\nd.  Several other HUD Handbook requirements were \"not\nmet\".\nFurther, HUD questioned the rationale cited and the soundne·· of\nthe conclusions of the PHA relating to the obsolescence of the\nHartford Park high-rises.\n31.  The PHA submitted a revised application for demolition\nof the Hartford Park high-rises on January 20, 1988 \"to assure\nthat all applicable requirements  (of the Code of Federal\nRegulations and the Handbook) have been addressed.\"  Sâa Appendix\nat 235-294.  Regarding demolition criteria, the PHA justified the\nproposed demolition of the high-rises on the grounds that:\na.  High-rise structures are vastly inappropriate for\n14\n\nb·  Th· resulting conditions have and will place an\nimmense financial burden on the PHA, noting that the cost of\nrenovating the high-rise units are substantially higher than\nthe low rise units;\nc.  The height of the buildings themselves and the\ndensity of the buildings lead tenants to choose low rise\nunits, thus causing high vacancy rates;\nd.  \"Tenant discontent** resulting from poverty and\nresentment of the physical environment at Hartford Park has\nlead to \"excessive deterioration** of the high-rises;\ne.  Demolition of the high-rises would help assure the\nuseful life of Hartford Park by removing a \"detrimental\ncatalyst\" to the quality of life for the remaining 5OS\nhouseholds.\nf.  \"In accordance with 24 C.F.R. 970\" no reasonable\nprogram of modernization is feasible to return the high-ri·e\ntowers to useful life.\n32.  The revised demolition application submitted by the PHA\naddressed the relocation of tenants displaced by the demolition\nof the high-rises, stating that the 32 single person households\nto be displaced by demolition would be \"housed temporarily  in\nthe remaining high-rise comprised of all one bedroom apartments\",\nand the remaining 6 family households that would be displaced\n\"can also be relocated to any of the remaining 30 vacant units at\nHartford Park.\"\n15\n\n33.  The revised application contained a section entitled\n\"Evaluation' of Tenant Comments\" regarding the issue of tenant\nparticipation.  Included in this section was a memorandum from\nthe PHA·s Executive Director to the PHA Board of Commissioners\ndated September 24, 1987 regarding the demolition of 240 units at\nHartford Park, as well as excerpts from the PHA Board of\nCommissioners meetings of June 3, 1987 and September 24, 1987.\n34.  The September 24th memorandum notes that the PHA\nreceived responses to the advertisement seeking proposals for the\nuse of the Hartford Park high-rises from plaintiff and from the\nHartford Park Tenant Association.  The memorandum notes that\nplaintiff's suggestion to use the high-rises for public housing\nwas \"rejected due to management and security problems inherent\nwith high-rise structures\".  Moreover, regarding the proposal\nsubmitted by the Hartford Park Tenants Association the memorandum\nstates \"(s)ince the PHA was seeking proposals for disposition of\nthe towers, the Tenant Association's proposal does not comply\nwith our request for proposals.\"\n35.  The minutes of June 3, 1987 and September 24, 1987 do\nnot reveal any consideration of any comments or proposals of\nplaintiff or the Hartford Park Tenants Association on the\nproposed demolition.  There was no additional opportunity given\nto plaintiff or any other group to either comment or participate\nin any discussions regarding the future of the Hartford Park\nHigh-rises after July of 1987.\n36.  The PHA included in its revised demolition application\n16\n\na \"Ti«· Table for Demolition and Replacement Housing\", indicating\nthat a demolition contract would not b· awarded until January 26,\n1990, aft«r construction of th· replacement units was completed\nand closed out.\n37.  The PHA included in its revised demolition application\na letter from Mayor Joseph R. Paolino, Jr. of the City of\nProvidence to the PHA dated January 11, 1988.  See Appendix at\n289-90.  The letter stated that the PHA·s proposal to demolish\nthe high-rises was \"in conformity with the City of Providence's\nHousing Assistance Plan\". (\"HAP\").  The letter, did not, however,\nspecify the number and type of units (i.e. family vs. elderly\nunits) that were to be demolished at Hartford Park.\n38.  The proposed demolition of the high-rises does not\nconform to the City of Providence's HAP.  The HAP in effect at\nthe time of the January 11, 1988 letter contained a provision\nregarding demolition of residential structures, which reads:\nThe City of Providence is committed to a general policy\nof not allowing the demolition of residential structures\nthat are occupied or occupiable by low and moderate income\nfamilies. . .  Demolition is only allowed if a property is\nso structurally damaged that it presents a clear and present\ndanger to the surrounding neighborhood.\nSee Appendix at 300.\n39.  On January 28, 1988 the HUD Field Office recommended\nto John Mongan, the HUD Regional Administrator, that the PHA's\napplication to demolish the Hartford ParJc high-rises be approved.\nSee Appendix at 310.  Approval was recommended subject to the\nsubmission of a Board resolution and the signature of legal\ncounsel on his letter included in the revised demolition\n17\n\napplication package.\n40.  On January 29, 1988 Mongan requested approval of the\nPHA's demolition application from James E. Baugh, General Deputy\nAssistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.  See Appendix\nat 311.  This request included a finding by the Regional\nAdministrator that the demolition was \"in compliance with 24 CFR\n970 (and) with the notations made by the Providence Field Office\nmemorandum dated January 28, 1988.\"\n41.  According to a memorandum dated February 9, 1988 from\nthe HUD Field Office to the Regional Administrator, additional\ninformation that was requested by Mr. Byers regarding the\ndemolition application was forwarded to HUD Headquarters in\nWashington, D.C. on February 4, 1988.  See Appendix at 312-328.\nThis information included an environmental assessment dated\nFebruary 4, 1988, PHA Board Resolution No. 3684 dated February 4,\n1988 passed by telephone poll, signed PHA Counsel Opinion, site\nlayout and flood rate insurance map.\n42.  The Environmental Assessment prepared by HUD regarding\nthe demolition of the Hartford Park high-rises and completed on\nFebruary 4, 1988 contained a finding of no significant impact\n(FONSI).  See Appendix at 316.  Th· FONSI was incorrect, as the\nFONSI wa· Mde  without any explanation why the proposed\ndemolition of the Hartford Park High-rises would not have a\nsignificant effect on the human environment.  HUD should have\nprepared an environmental impact statement on the proposed\ndemolition of the high-rises, as HUD's approval of the demolition\n18\n\napplication was a major federal action\nth· envir©im·nt.\n43.  Th· Environmental Assessment and FONSI prepared by HUD\nalso failed to discuss and take into account several significant\nenvironmental effects including:\na.  The long and short term impacts on the supply of\nlow income public housing for families in Providence and\nsurrounding cities and towns caused by the demolition of the\nHartford Park high-rises;\nb.  The impact of man-made hazards and nuisances\ncaused by the demolition of the Hartford Park high-rises on\nthe tenants of Hartford Park not displaced by modernization\nactivities and the environment at large (e.g. asbestos and\nPCB removal).\n44.  The Environmental Assessment completed on February 4,\n1988 stated there were no unresolved conflicts concerning\nalternative uses of available resources under Section 102 (E) of\nthe National Environmental Policy Act.  Further the Environmental\nAssessment did not list or discuss any alternatives to the\nproposed demolition of the Hartford Park high-rises.\n45.  A HUD Environmental Clearance Officer did not review\nand concur with the Environmental Assessment completed on\nFebruary 4, 1988.  Furthermore, the EA prepared by HUD was\ndefective because HUD failed to:\na.  incorporate the scattered site plan in the EA;\nb.  begin the NEPA process until a few days before the\n19\n\ndaaolition application was approved;\nC·  involve Plaintiff in th· preparation of the EA and\nnotify Plaintiff of the availablility of the FONSI.\n46.  At approximately 4:30 p.m. on February 4, 1988, Baugh,\nHUD General Deputy Assistant Secretary for.Public and Indian\nHousing informed the HUD Regional Administrator that the PHA's\ndemolition application was approved.  See Appendix at 329.  in\napproving the application Baugh found that the application was\nconsistent with \"Departmental policy, the public housing\ndemolition/disposition regulation, 24 C.F.R. part 970 and Section\n18 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937,, as amended\" (42 U.S.C.\n§l437p).  Further, Baugh noted that the demolition request \"meets\nthe requirements of Section l8(a)(l) of the Act and Section\n970.6(c) of the regulations in that the partial demolition of the\nunits will reduce the project density and thereby assure th·\nuseful life of the remaining portion of the project.\"  Baugh also\nnoted that the PHA \"has submitted evidence of tenant\nparticipation indicating some tenant support for partial\ndemolition\", and that \"the PHA did indicate how its proposal Joes\nagree with a portion of the (Hartford Park) tenants1 proposal.-\nFinally, Baugh found that the demolition proposal conforms to the\nCity of Providence's Housing Assistance Plan and that the\nEnvironmental Assessment resulted in a finding of no significant\nimpact.\n47.  Plaintiff's never had the opportunity to review or\ncomment on the Environmental Assessment or the FONSI before HUD\n20\n\napproved th· demolition of the Hartford Park high-rises.\n48.  Th· Environmental Assessment was not a good faith\nconsideration of the environmental impacts of the demolition of\nHartford Park, given that the Environmental Assessment was based\non a site review of the Hartford Park site conducted on February\n3, 1988 and the assessment was prepared and completed on the date\nthe project was approved by HUD, February 4, 1988.\n49.  On February 5, 1988 The HUD Field Office was still\ncompleting the environmental assessment that had been\n\"completed\" on February 4th.  On that day the HUD Field Office\nsent a letter to the Rhode Island Historical Preservation\nCommission seeking comments on the proposed demolition.  See\nAppendix at 3 30.  The environmental assessment indicated that\ncomments from the Historical Preservation Commission had been\nrequested.  Comments from the Historical Preservation Commission\nwere not sent back to the HUD Field Office until February 19,\n1988.\n50.  Subsequent to February 5, 1988 HUD still had to provide\nthe PHA with assistance to demolish the high-rises, including\ntransferring the funds \"reserved\" to demolish the high-rises and\nconstruct the replacement units on scattered sites.\n51.  On February 11, 1988 Baugh's memorandum to Mongan\napproving the PHA's demolition request was transmitted to the HUD\nField Office.\n52.  Both the application for demolition submitted to HUD by\nthe PHA on September 29, 1987 and the revised demolition\n21\n\napplication dated January, 1988 and approved by HUD fail to meet\nthe applicable requirements especially relating to permitted\ndemolition criteria, tenant participation, tenant relocation and\none for one replacement of demolished units.\n53.  HUD failed to follow the required application\nprocessing procedures when it processed the PHA's application to\ndemolish the Hartford Park high-rises, especially environmental\nreview procedures and insuring the PHA's application met the\napplicable requirements referred in paragraph 40, supra.\n54.  The PHA plans to demolish the Hartford Park high-rises\non or about April 24, 1989, and has already begun work to prepare\nthe buildings for demolition, despite the fact that some tenants\nremain.  The PHA plans to proceed with the demolition even though\nthe PHA has not determined the location of the sites for\nconstructing the replacement units and HUD has not approved the\nlocation for constructing replacement units.  This new demolition\nschedule contradicts the demolition and construction schedule set\nforth in the revised demolition applications submitted to and\napproved by HUD, which states that the demolition contract would\nnot be awarded until January 26, 1990, after construction ai £üs\nreplacement units was completed and closed out.  Furthermore,\nthis plan is inconsistent with PHA Resolution Number 3672 which\nprohibits th· PHA from commencing demolition of these buildings\nuntil the PHA '•has received any and all necessary funding and\napproval to commence construction of an equivalent number of new,\nscattered site, replacement units.\"\n22\n\nTHE \"SCATTERED SITE\" PLAN\n55.  On or about April 2, 1987 the Providence city Council\nvoted to authorize the PHA to submit an application for a\npreliminary loan for surveys and planning in connection with 3 60\nunits of low rent public housing.  See Appendix at 81, 97.\n56.  The PHA submitted to HUD on April 10, 1987 an\napplication for development of 360 units of public housing to be\nbuilt on sites scattered throughout the City of Providence,  see\nAppendix at 81.  Attached to that application was a letter from\nProvidence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. (Paolino) indicating his\nsupport for the application and the proposal to demolish the\nhigh-rise structures at Hartford Park.  Paolino stated:\nThe development of 360 new units of public housing will\nsupport the City's efforts to upgrade various neighborhoods\nin conformity with Providence's Housing Assistance Plan.\nThe City of Providence has committed substantial resources\nto the revitalization of its neighborhoods.  Our Department\nof Planning and Development will coordinate the City's\nVacant Lot Program with your development effort.\nId. at\n57.  Th%.PHA's application for 360 units was reviewed by a,\nnumber of Divisions within HUD, including the Division of Fair\nHousing/Equa½» Opportunity <FHlø) .  According to HUD·s \"Public*\nHousing and Development Handbook11/ paragraph 4-24, Handbook\n7417.1 Rev-1  (October, 1980) the FHEO Director \"must determine\nthat the PHA is complying with all civil rights and equal-\nopportunity requirements\" in ord·r to recommend approval.\nFurther, in making this determination, the Handbook states that\n23\n\n'iconsideration is given to the PHA's past performance in\nselecting site· that provided housing opportunities outside areas\nof minority concentration . . .\"  Sfifi Appendix at 334, 335.\n58.  The Regional division of Fair Housing/Equal Opportunity\nexpressed reservations about the PHA's application.  On May 11,\n1987 a memorandum from the HUD Regional Office by Jeanne\nMcHallam, Acting Director of the Program Operations Division,\n1E0, was sent to the Manager of the Providence HUD office\nregarding the PHA's application for 360 units of public housing.\nSee Appendix at 336.  The memorandum indicated that approval by\nthe Regional Office of this application was being deferred,\npending HUD Headquarters' action on a preliminary determination\nmade by the HUD Regional Office that the PHA was in non-\ncompliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n59.  On or about September 30, 1987 HUD acted on the PHA··\napplication for 360 units of public housing dated April 10, I9·7.\nHUD decided to fund the development of 184 units for \"replacement\nhousing due to the proposed demolition of public housing units in\nthe Hartford Park area*, and reserved $44*53^>,a¯3`·Z for\nconstructing these units«  See Appendix at 337.\n60.  In response to HUD·s approval of 184 units, the PHA\ncirculated a request for proposals to the public soliciting\nproposals from developers to construct some or all of these\nunits.  By the end of April, 1988 the PHA received proposal* from\nfive developers to construct a total of 395 units on 159 sites\nSee Appendix at 3 39.\n24\n\n61.  Th· staff of th· PHA proceeded to evaluat· th· proposed\nsites, and either accepted or rejected the sites.  A list of the\n89 accepted sites for construction of these units was developed.\nAppendix at 340-45.  A list of the 70 rejected sites was also\nprepared.  Appendix at 346-48.  A map of all census tracts in the\nCity of Providence with a breakdown of the number of accepted\nproposed sites per census tract is also set forth in the Appendix\nat 349.\n62.  The accepted proposed sites were in the following\ncensus tracts:  l-7, inclusive, (Washington Park, Elmwood, Upper\nSouth Providence and Lower South Providence neighborhoods), 12\nand 14 (West End neighborhood), 22 (Valley neighborhood) and 2ft\n(Smith Hill neighborhood).  There were no proposed sites accepted\nin the following census tracts: 8-11,inclusive,  (Downtown and\nFederal Hill neighborhoods), 13 (Armory District), 15-21,\ninclusive,  (Reservoir, Silver Lake, Hartford, Olneyville, M*nton\nand Mount Pleasant neighborhoods), 23-25, inclusive (Elmhurst and\nSmith Hill neighborhoods) and 27-37 (Wanskuck, North End, Mount\nHope, Hope, Blackstone, Wayland, College Hill and Fox Point\nneighborhoods).\n63.  The PHA staff rejected proposed sites in the following\nneighborhoods in which no proposed sites were approved:\nOlneyville and Downtown.\n64.  On or about June 24, 1988, the scattered site plan\nrecommended by the PHA staff was sent to PHA Board.  On or about\nJuly 7, 1988 the PHA board approved the construction of 15 2 units\n25\n\non 73 sites.  Th· 73 sites were located in the following\nneighborhoods: Elmwood, Upper South Providence, Lower South\nProvidence*, the West End, Valley, Smith Hill and Washington Park.\nSee Appendix at 350-51.\n65.  On or about July 20, 1988 the PHA submitted an\napplication for the development of 56 units of scattered site\npublic housing to replace demolished units at Hartford Park.  See\nAppendix at 352-370.\n66.  On or about August 4, 1988, the Providence City Council\nvoted against rescinding the scattered site plan approved by the\nPHA Board of Commissioners on or about July 7, 1988.  The vote\nwas 4 to 7, with one abstention.  Only those councilpersons from\nElmwood, Upper South Providence, Lower South Providence,\nWashington Park and the West End voted in favor of rescinding the\nplan.\n67.  The PHA'3 application for 56 units was reviewed by a\nnumber of Divisions within HUD, including the Division of Fair\nHousing/Equal Opportunity  (FHEQ).  On August 19, 1988, a\nmemorandum was sent to the Providence HUD office from Benjamin w.\nLittle, Director, Program operations Division 1EO, stating that\nthere was \"insufficient information for FHEO to recommend\napproval* of the application.  S_fifi Appendix at 371.  The\nmemorandum also quoted the section of HUD Handbook 7417.1 Rev-1\nquoted in paragraph 57, supra.\n68.  On September 8, 1988, a second memorandum was sent by\nLittle to the Providence HUD office indicating FHEO·s conditional\n26\n\napproval of th· PHA·s application.  Sea Appendix at 372.  Th·\nmemoranda*stated that \"approval of this application is\nconditional that areas of non-minority concentration are,\nutilized1*.  Attached to the memorandum was a list of\nneighborhoods with 0-19% minority concentration.  A copy of this\nreview was sent to the PHA by the Providence HUD office on or\nabout October 26, 1988.  See Appendix at 372-73.\n69.  On or about September 28, 1988, HUD approved the PHA's\napplication for 56 units and reserved funds in the amount of\n$4,762,800.  Sss Appendix at 374.\n70.  On or about December 12, 1988, the PHA announced a n·w\n\"scattered site\" plan.  Under this new plan 32 replacement units\nwere to be moved out of the Upper South Providence and West End\nneighborhoods and distributed in other neighborhoods,  of these\n3 2 units, 2 2 units were to be located in the following\nneighborhoods, none of which were previously designated to\nreceive replacement units:  Federal Hill, Manton, Olneyville, and\nWansJcucJc.  See Appendix at 375-76.\n71.  Neither HUD nor the City of Providence has approved\nthe sites for the location of either the 184 or 56 units of\nscattered site public housing.  In fact, the PHA does not even\nknow wher· all of the sites for the 240 replacement units will be\nlocated, and, thus cannot )cnow when the replacement units will be\ncompleted and readied for occupancy.\n72.  The lack of a balanc·d distribution of th· scattered\nsites, and the small number of proposed sites in many\n27\n\nneighborhoods will contribute to th· loss of op·n housing'\nopportunities in these neighborhoods for lower income anóV\nminority faailies.  The PHA'a scattered site plan will have a\ndisparate impact on minorities in two ways:  (1) it will\nrestrict choice and restrict open housing opportunities for those\nfamilies on the PHA's waiting list, who are disproportionately\nminority, and  (2) it will contribute to the resegregation and\nloss of diversity in the Hartford Park neighborhood (losing 240\nfamily units) and other neighborhoods which do not have a\nproportionate share of public housing,\n73.  The PHA, in January, 1939, expressly declined to seek a\nwider choice of sites by inviting the participation of six\nneighboring communities, participation which the PHA could have\nat least attempted pursuant to R.I.G.L. §45-25-22.  The six\ncommunities,  identified in a request by the Project B.A.S.I.C.\nTenants Union in December of 1988, are Warwick, Cranston,\nJohnston, North Providence, East Providence, and Barrington.\n74.  The PHA has an affirmative obligation to promote,\ngreater open housing opportunitites, based on Title VIII of the\nCivil Rights Act Of 1968, 42 U.S.C. §3608.\n75.  The PHA has knowingly declined to pursue sites in\ncertain neighborhoods which have little or no subsidized housing,\neven though such sites were submitted to the PHA as potential\nscattered-site development lots.\n76.  Th· PHA has indicated that it may not actively obtain\nsites for all the replacement units, in light of th· difficulty\n28\n\nit has experienced thus far in locating sites'.\n77,  TV© city council members ar· on the PHA's Board of\nComnission·rs.  As of July, 1988, none of the tentatively\napproved sites for 152 units were in their wards (Ward 3 and 7) .\nThe December, 1988, revised plan did not contain significant\namendments on this issue, with 148 of the 184 units still being\nin South Providence, the West End and Elmwood.\nhave transferred lots for the development of home ownership\nprograms and have\nowners.  However, as of*~««rtïh-r\"l9«9, the City and the PRA have\ntransferred few lots to the PHA for the scattered site public-\nhousing units:\n79.  .The city has rejected suggestions that it financially\nassist the PHA in acquiring sites in those neighborhoods which-\ncurrently have little or no low income housing,\n80.  HUD's public housing cost containment restrictions\ncontribute to the lack of sites in many neighborhoods.  HUD has\nbeen aware of the Title VIII issues raised by the scattered site\nprogram for over a year.  Among other avenues of learning of the\nlack of open housing opportunity, HUD received a specific written\nstatement from plaintiff's attorney in April of l988f.  HUD was\nalso put on notice that the Urban League of Rhode Island issued\na report in 1988 which found that housing segregation is \"more of\na reality today that it was in 1970,n with minorities grouped in\nthe central cities of Providence, Pawtucket, Woonsocket, and\n29\n\nCentral Falls.\nTHE SHELTER\n81.  Pro-CAP intended to develop a shelter for the homeless\nat 521 Broad Street, Providence, in an area experiencing\ngentrification pressures.  Pro-CAP entered into a purchase and\nsale contract to purchase the Broad Street property in June,\n1988.\n82.  The City exerts significant influence over Pro-CAP\ndecisions, with overlap between City officials and the Pro-CAP\nBoard.\n83.  Due to neighborhood opposition, based at least In part\non the income and race of prospective sh·lter residents, Pro-CAP\nand the City decided to cancel the plan to develop the Broad\nStreet shelter.  The Mayor acknowledged that they were using a\ntechnicality to get out of the contract.\n84.  The City, the PRA and the PHA then proceeded to select\nland in the middle of the Hartford Park development  including\npart of the Laurel Hill Park playground for the shelter.\nHartford Park is the same public housing project where the PHA\nhas decided to demolish 240 units in order to reduce density.\n85.  Th· PRA has acknowledged that the Broad Street site was\npreferable based on location, transportation and planned acc·ss\nto other social services for the homeless.\n86.  The proposed shelter at Hartford Par* will occupy 60%\nof the site of the existing playground.\n30\n\n87.  Th· City, Pro-CAP and th· PHA have based th·ir\ndecisions on th· shelter, in part, on th· opposition of other\nneighborhoods to a proposed shelter due to th· rac· and income of'\nprospectiv· shelter residents.  Their decision to locate the\nshelter within Hartford Park, despite the contradiction with\ntheir own arguments on density and related problems is based, in\npart on the largely minority tenant population of Hartford Park\nand its relatively less powerful constituency.\n88.  The non-federal defendants caused at least a one year\ndelay in the availability of the badly needed shelter, and\nsacrificed available operating funds ($200,000) from the State's\nDepartment of Human Services.  The shelter, originally to be\noperating for the winter of 1988-89, now may not even be\navailable for the following winter.\n89.  HUD is aware of the proposed shelter plan for Hartford\nPark and is aware that the non-federal defendants' actions\ncontradict the PHA's position that the demolition of the high-\nrises will reduce project density and reduce the concentration of\nfamilies experiencing social and economic difficulty.\n90.  HUD is also aware of the wider context of the problem\nin that a $454,120 grant was returned in 1988 to HUD by the\nTraveler** Aid Society, after that agency encountered fierce\nneighborhood opposition to a proposed homeless shelter in both\nthe North End and Mount Hope neighborhoods of Providence.\n91.  The defendants' actions in regard to the shelter, the\ndemolition and the related scattered* sit* devwlopnent have all\n31\n\ncontributed, and continue to contribute to the lack of affordable\nopen housing throughout the City of Providence and surrounding\nmetropolitan area, as demonstrated by the 941 households\npresently on the waiting list for public housing in Providence.\nSâS Appendix at 378-79.  Further, these same actions have\nfostered continued racial opposition to low income housing in\ncertain areas, and have directly harmed the efforts of plaintiff\nto make available a greater supply, and a greater range of\nchoice, in the affordable housing stock.\nCAUSES OF ACTION\nA.  THE HUD DEFENDANTS\n92.  In approving the demolition and scattered site plan,\nthe HUD defendants' actions are arbitrary, capricious and\ncontrary to the U.S. Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §l437p,\nboth in its present form and as it existed prior to the Housing\nand Community  Development Act amendments of 1987, the applicable\nregulations at 24 C.F.R. §970 and the requirements set out in\nthe Public Housing Demolition, Disposition and Conversion\nHandbook, 7486.1, (Oct. 24, 1986) (\"HUD Handbook\").  Plaintiff\nseeks review of HUD·s actions pursuant to the Administrative\nProcedure Act  (APA), 5 U.S.C. §701 et seq.\n93.  HUD·s actions and inactions with regards to the\nproposed demolition and scattered site plans fail to satisfy\nHUD·s obligations to affirmatively promote open housing\n32\n\nopportunity as required by the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.s.c. S36O8.\nHUÐ's actions and inactions are reviewable pursuant to the APA, 5\nU.S.C. §701 •t seq.\n94.  HUD's failure to prepare an environmental assessment\nwith the review and concurrence of the HUD environmental\nclearance officer was unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, an\nabuse of discretion, and contrary to HUD regulations and\nprocedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act\n(NEPA), at 24 C.F.R. §50.32 and HUD Handbook 7486.1 §2-5(a)(2)\n(Oct. 24, 1986), reviewable pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C. §701 et\nseq.\n95.  HUD·s Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and\nHUD's decision not to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement\nwere unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious an abuse of discretion,\nand contrary to Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §4332, reviewable pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C.\n§701 et seq.\n96.  HUD·s failure to include the environmental impacts of\nthe scattered site plan in, its Environmental Assessment was\nunreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and\ncontrary to th· regulations of both HUD and the Council on\nEnvironmental Quality, 24 C.F.R. §5O.l(b), 24 C.F.R. §5O.2l(a),\n40 C.F.R. S1508.7, and NEPA, reviewable pursuant to the APA, 5\nU.S.C. §701 et seq.\n97.  HUD's failure to involve plaintiff in the preparation\nof the Environmental Assessment, and subsequent failure to make\n33\n\nits FONSI available to plaintiff prior to approving th·\ndemolition of th· Hartford Park high-rises was unreasonable,\narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and contrary to the\nregulations of both HUD and the Council on Environmental\nQuality, implementing NEPA, 24 C.F.R. §5O.l(b), 40 C.F.R.\n§1501.4, and NEPA, reviewable pursuant to the APA, 5 U.s.c. §701\net seq.\n98.  HUD's failure to study, develop and describe\nalternatives to the demolition of the Hartford Par* high-ri·es,\nparticularly in light of plaintiff's comments on the proposed\ndemolition violated 42 U.S.C. §l437p and Section 102(2)(E) of the\nNational Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §4332(E).\n99.  HUD'S actions and inactions in regards to the\ndemolition and scattered site plan, particularly in the plan's\nimpact on minority rights under the Fair Housing Act, as set\nforth above, give rise to plaintiff's cause of action under the\nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. $3601 et seq., for the relief\navailable to pursuant to the APA, plus the legal fees and costs\navailable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §3601 et seq.\nB.  THE PHA DEFENDANTS\n100. The PHA·s actions and failures to act, described,\nsupra, in relation to the proposed demolition of the Hartford\nPark high-rises, are violative of the U.S. Housing Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§l4 37p, in both its current amended version and its pre-amendaent\nversion, giving rise to plaintiff's cause of action under §l4\n34\n\ndirectly and und·r that statute and 42 U.S.C. §1983.\n101—The* PHA's actions and failures to act, regarding the\ndemolition and scattered site plan, and the proposed shelter,\nviolate plaintiff's rights guaranteed by the Fair Housing Act, 42 -\nU.S.C. §3601 et seq., under both the intent standard and the\ndisparate effects standard, as well as the Equal Protection and\nDue Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, giving rise to plaintiff's cause of action\nunder both Title VIII, 42 U.S.C. §3601 et seq., and 42 U.S.C.\n§1983.\n102. The PHA's actions and failures to act, regarding th·\ndemolition and scattered site plan, and the proposed shelter,\nviolate plaintiff's rights under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2OOOd, with its implementing regulations, 24\nC.F.R. §l;4(b)(2), in light of the fact the PHA has ¤aí cho»·n\nthe least discriminatory alternative.  Plaintiff's claim und·r\nTitle VI is based on both the intent standard and the disparate\neffects standard*\n103. The PHA·s actions in talcing steps to demolish Hartford\nPark units in advance of the PHA's own resolution authorizing\nsuch demolition is ultra vires and denies to plaintiff the iue\nprocess of the law guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth\namendments to the United States Constitution, giving rise to\nplaintiff's cause of action under 42 U.S.C. §1983.\n35\n\nC.  THE CITY OF PROVIDgMC¾ fCity)\n104. The>City of Providence (City), through its own offic··\nand through it· involvement with th· PHA and Pro-CAP, has failed\nto affirmatively promote open housing throughout the entire city,\nin relation to the demolition and scattered site plan, and\nshelter plan, in violation of its affirmative duty under Title\nVIII and under the Housing and Community Development Act  (CDBG\nProgram), giving rise to plaintiff's cause of action under 42\nU.S.C. §3601 et seq. and under §1983.\n105.  The City of Providence (City), through its own offices\nand through its involvement with the PHA and Pro-CAP, has\ndiscriminated on the basis of race, under an intent standard and\na disparate effects standard, in its actions and inactions with\nregard to the demolition/scattered site plan and the decisions\nregarding the shelter, all in violation of Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2OOOd, giving rise to plaintiff•s\ncause of action under Title VI and under 42 U.S.C. §1983.\n106.  The city of Providence (City), through its own\noffices and through its involvement with the PHA and Pro-CAP, has\ndiscriminated on the basis of race in relation to the\ndemolition/scattered site plan and the shelter plans, knowingly\nand intentionally, in violation of plaintiff's rights under the\nEqual Protection and Due Process clauses of the United States\nConstitution, giving rise to plaintiff's cause of action under 42\nU.S.C. §1983.\n36\n\nD.  PRO-CAP\n107- Defendant Pro-CAP, by allowing community and political\nopposition to th· prosp«ctiv· residents of its proposed -shelter\nto in part guide its decision to change the shelter's location\nfrom Broad Street to Hartford Park, and to delay the opening of\nthe shelter, has violated plaintiff's rights under the Fair\nHousing Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. §3601 et seq.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court:\n1.)  assume jurisdiction over this matter;\n2.)  issue such temporary and preliminary relief as\nspecifically requested by motion by the plaintiff;\n3.)  enjoin HUD and the PHA to take no further steps towards\ndemolition of the Hartford Park high-rises until and\nunless they have satisfied all statutory requirements\nunder the U.S. Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §l437p;\n4.)  enjoin HUD and the PHA to commence the rehabilitation\nand the rent-up of the unoccupied units at Hartford\nPark, particularly those in the high-rises;\n5.)  enjoin HUD and the PHA to provide ongoing and adequate\nmaintenance, management and security staffing at the\nhigh-rises so as to maintain their habitability;\n6.)  enjoin the City and the PHA to develop a revised\nscattered site housing plan which will result in open\nhousing opportunities throughout the City, including\nall neighborhoods;\n37\n\n7.)  enjoin th· PHA to r·qu··t cooperation agreements from\nth· six communities suggested by plaintiff, for\nassistance in siting the scattered site units;\n8.)  enjoin HUD to complete both a full environmental\nassessment and an environmental impact statement on the\ndemolition and scattered site plan prior to carrying\nout further steps at the current plan, including the\nadvancing of HUD funds and authorizations;\n9.)  enjoin the PHA and HUD to fully consider and\ninvestigate all reasonable alternatives to demolition\nand all reasonable alternatives to the present\nscattered site plan, to involve plaintiff in all stages\nof said consideration and investigation, and to develop\nan administrative record which fully reviews all such\nalternatives, prior to taking further steps towards\ncarrying out the current demolition and scattered site\nplan;\n10.) enjoin the PHA to rescind its current eviction notices\nserved on tenants occupying units scheduled for\ndemolition, and to provide full services, maintenance\nand security to such tenants, and to cease its efforts\nto cause the constructive demolition of Hartford Park\nthrough evictions and a policy of not filling\nvacancies;\n11.) enjoin Pro-CAP to rescind its decision on siting the\nshelter at Hartford Park and to locate and develop the\n38\n\nshelter either on the original Broad Street site or on\nsorn· other site in the City, which is suitable in terms\nof transportation and services, and which promotes open\nhousing opportunities throughout the City;\n12.) enjoin the non-federal defendants to restore the\nforfeited shelter funding, lost through delays caused\nby their opposition to the original plan;\n13.) award damages to the plaintiff, costs and fees pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. §3601 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. §1988; and\n14.) award such other relief as this Court deems just and\nappropriate.\nRespectfully Submitted,\nPROJECT B.A.S.I.C.\nBy its Attorneys\n\"Steven FischbacñN^\nRhode Island Legal Services\n77 Dorranee Street\nProvidence, R.

Cosentino, Providence, R.I., for defendant Providence Community Action Program (PRO-CAP).\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nPETTINE, Senior District Judge.\nThis suit was filed by the plaintiff, Project B.A.S.I.C., a tenants organization, challenging the demolition of the\nHartford Park Housing Project, the plan for scattered-site replacement housing and the location of a homeless\nshelter. In an earlier decision, this Court denied plaintiff's motion to enjoin the demolition and established a\ntimetable for the completion of the replacement housing. Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 721 F.Supp. 1501\n[1]\n(D.R.I.1989).  The issues remaining in the case are plaintiff's challenge to the location of the scattered site\nhousing and the issues surrounding the homeless shelter.\nThe federal defendants, Secretary Jack Kemp and the Department of Housing and Urban Development\n(collectively, \"HUD\"), and the local defendants, Steven J. O'Rourke, Director of the Housing Authority of the City\nof Providence, and the Housing Authority itself (collectively, \"PHA\"), have each moved for summary judgment.\n640 HUD's motion addresses the only issue involving *640 HUD: its liability under the Fair Housing Act (or \"Title VIII\"),\n42 U.S.C. § 3608, for its conduct in approving the location of the scattered site housing, reviewable under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. (\"APA\"). PHA moves for partial summary judgment on the\nissue of its role in the siting of the replacement housing under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.,\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq., and the equal protection and due process\nclauses of the fourteenth amendment.\nOn a motion for summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 requires \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]\" Hebert v. Mohawk Rubber Co., 872\nF.2d 1104, 1106 (1st Cir.1989). When a party moves for summary judgment, it must \"put the ball in play, averring\n`an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.'\" Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48\n(1st Cir.1990) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)\n). Once the movant has done so, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to \"establish the existence of at least\none fact issue which is both `genuine' and `material.'\" Id. A court must construe all factual inferences in the\n\nnonmoving party's favor. Voccio v. General Signal Corp., 732 F.Supp. 292, 294 (D.R.I.1990). On the basis of this\nstandard and the foregoing reasons, the defendants' motions for summary judgment are denied.\nI. Factual Background\nThe facts relating to the demolition of the high-rises at Hartford Park are set out in Project B.A.S.I.C., 721 F.Supp.\n1501, and I will not repeat them here except to say that it was the demolition of the subsidized housing there that\nled to the need for the 240 units of replacement housing now at issue. Constructing the replacement housing is a\njoint effort by HUD and PHA. For this project, HUD approved PHA's use of the \"turnkey\" method. Under the\nturnkey method, PHA advertises for and selects developers who submit proposals for sites owned by or to be\npurchased by the developer. 24 C.F.R. § 941.102(b). PHA then submits the sites for preliminary review to the\nHUD field office. Id. If HUD determines that the proposed sites comply with applicable standards, the developer\nprepares design and construction documents which both the PHA and the HUD field office review and approve.\nFollowing such approval, PHA and HUD enter into a contract under which HUD provides financial assistance to\nthe PHA and the PHA promises to comply with HUD requirements relating to the development and operation of\nthe project. The developer and PHA enter into a contract of sale which is approved by the HUD field office. Upon\ncompletion of the project, PHA purchases the project.\nThe PHA received funds from HUD in two separate allocations, in September 1987 and September 1988. In April\n1989, PHA began to submit specific sites for HUD review. HUD's review is governed by various statutory\nprovisions, including the Fair Housing Act, as well as HUD's own regulations and guidelines. The basic criteria for\nthe review is set forth in HUD's Site and Neighborhood Standards, 24 C.F.R. § 941.202. The requirements\ninclude adequate access to utilities and service streets; access to schools, recreational and health facilities and\njob opportunities, and a lack of adverse environmental conditions. Id. Most significant for our purposes is that the\nregulations also provide that sites for new construction must not be located in an area of minority concentration\nunless 1) sufficient, comparable opportunities exist for housing for minority families, in the range to be served by\nthe proposed project, outside areas of minority concentration or 2) the project is necessary to meet overriding\nhousing needs. Id. New construction also may not be located in a racially mixed area if the project will cause a\nsignificant increase in the proportion of minority to non-minority residents in the area and must avoid undue\nconcentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low income persons. Id. Moreover,\n641 HUD is constrained by 42 U.S.C. *641 § 1436b which mandates that sites not be excluded from consideration\n\"solely because the site proposed is located within [a minority] impacted area.\"\nAfter PHA began submitting specific sites, HUD decided that under their regulations it would be permissible for\nPHA to site up to half of the replacement units in areas of minority concentration. HUD defined \"areas of minority\nconcentration\" as census tracts in Providence with minority populations greater than 21.5% according to the 1980\n[2]\ncensus.\nAs of February 1, 1991, the status of the 240 units was as follows:\n1. 131 Units: HUD has given final approval and entered into contracts with the PHA. Of these 131 units, 71 are\ncomplete and under PHA ownership (including 67 that are already occupied); the remaining units are in various\nstages of construction.\n2. 89 Units: HUD has given initial site approval, but the developer packages have not yet been approved. For 23\nof these units, HUD is currently reviewing developer packages.\n3. 20 Units: No sites have been selected.\nOf the 220 units for which HUD already has provided either final approval or initial review (categories 1 and 2\nabove), 119 units are located in non-minority concentrated areas (as defined by HUD); the remaining 101 units\nare located in areas of minority concentration.\nHUD contends that its actions must be upheld, as a matter of law, unless shown to be \"arbitrary and capricious\"\nunder the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706. It argues that this Court's review must be limited solely to the administrative\n\nrecord and that summary judgment is the only proper vehicle for resolving this case. PHA relies primarily on\nHUD's brief and contends that if HUD's approval was proper PHA cannot be liable. Basically, PHA argues that it\nis shielded by HUD's review. Plaintiff, conceding that the APA is the proper vehicle for reviewing the claim against\nHUD, contends that a trial is necessary because there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute.\nII. HUD\nA. APA Review\nHUD and the plaintiff agree that the claim against HUD must be reviewed under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.\nSection 702 provides that\nA person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by\nagency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof. An\naction in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim\nthat an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or\nunder color of legal authority shall not be dismissed or relief therein denied on the ground that it is\nagainst the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party.\nThe APA standard of review is set forth in Section 706(2)(A), (C): \"[t]he reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set\naside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\notherwise not in accordance with law\" or \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of\nstatutory right....\"\nHUD's contention with regard to the standard of review focuses primarily on the \"arbitrary and capricious\" aspect\nof Section 706 while neglecting the possibility of a direct statutory challenge under the APA. See Cousins v. Sec'y\nof U.S. Dep't of Transportation, 880 F.2d 603, 608 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc). HUD's emphasis on this particular\naspect is not unusual.\nCourts and litigants may typically refer to the first, \"arbitrary, capricious\" type of legal challenge, in\n642 a shorthand matter, *642 as an \"APA challenge,\" and they may refer to the question whether the\nregulations violate a substantive statute as a challenge under the statute itself. But technically this\nlatter challenge falls within the purview of the APA just as the former does. Id.\nIn this case, plaintiff is bringing a challenge directly under the Fair Housing Act (or \"Title VIII\"), 42 U.S.C. § 3608,\nwhich sets forth HUD's duty to \"administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development\nin a manner affirmatively to further the policies of this sub-chapter.\" Id. at § 3608(e)(5).\nEven as a direct statutory challenge under the APA, as a threshold matter, agency action is not reviewable if it is\n\"committed to agency discretion by law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1). In Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,\n401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), a seminal case on the APA, the Supreme Court explained\nthat this exemption is not applicable when there is \"law to apply.\" Id. at 413, 91 S.Ct. at 822. The Court also\ndiscussed the standard of review under Section 706 and stated that the reviewing court is \"to engage in a\nsubstantial inquiry.\" Id. at 415, 91 S.Ct. at 823. Furthermore, although an agency decision is entitled to \"a\npresumption of regularity,\" such presumption does not \"shield [the] action from a thorough, probing, in-depth\nreview.\" Id. A reviewing court's first inquiry concerns whether the agency acted within the scope of its authority. Id.\nThis first step involves defining the scope of the agency authority and determining whether the agency could\nreasonably believe it was acting within the scope of that authority. Id. at 415-16, 91 S.Ct. at 823-24. Next, a court\nmust determine whether the actual decision made meets the standard set forth in Section 706. \"To make this\nfinding the court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and\nwhether there has been a clear error of judgment.\" Id. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 824. A court may not, however,\n\"substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\" Id.\nIn the context of a challenge under the Fair Housing Act, the First Circuit Court of Appeals has held that HUD's\naffirmative duty under the Fair Housing Act is not committed to agency discretion and is, therefore, reviewable\n\nunder the APA. NAACP v. Sec'y of HUD, 817 F.2d 149, 151 (1st Cir.1987). The court found that the Fair Housing\nAct supplied sufficient standards; there was \"law to apply.\" Id. at 158. The court also noted that although \"HUD\npossesses broad discretionary powers to develop, award, and administer its grants and to decide the degree to\nwhich they can be shaped to help achieve Title VIII's goals,\" this \"does not in itself mean that HUD is immune\nfrom review.\" Id. at 157. In other words, while HUD has discretion in carrying out its duty, the duty itself is not\ndiscretionary. See Shannon v. HUD, 436 F.2d 809, 819 (3rd Cir.1970) (HUD has discretion, but discretion must\nbe exercised in favor of fair housing); Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, 715 F.Supp. 835, 839\n(N.D.Ohio 1989) (compliance with the Fair Housing Act is not discretionary).\nB. The Fair Housing Act\nThe basic inquiry with regard to HUD is whether HUD fulfilled its affirmative duty under the Fair Housing Act. This\nduty is more than simply a duty to refrain from discrimination; rather the Act \"reflects the desire to have HUD use\nits grant programs to assist in ending discrimination and segregation, to the point where the supply of genuinely\nopen housing increases.\" NAACP, 817 F.2d at 155.\nThe First Circuit Court of Appeals has established what is minimally required of HUD. HUD must consider the\neffect of its actions \"on the racial and socio-economic composition of the surrounding area.\" Id. at 156.\nAnd, the need for such consideration itself implies, at a minimum an obligation to assess\nnegatively those aspects of a proposed cause of action that would further limit the supply of\n643 genuinely open housing and to assess positively those aspects of a proposed course of action \n*643 that would increase that supply. If HUD is doing so in any meaningful way, one would expect\nto see, over time, if not in any individual case, HUD activity that tends to increase, or at least, that\ndoes not significantly diminish, the supply of open housing. Id.\nMoreover, the obligation does not end with a mere consideration of the proper factors. NAACP v. Kemp, 721\nF.Supp. 361, 365, 67 (D.Mass.1989). \"Action must be taken to fulfill, as much as possible, the goal of open,\nintegrated residential housing patterns and to prevent the increase of segregation, in ghettos, of racial groups\nwhose lack of opportunities the Act was designed to combat.\" Otero v. New York City Housing Authority, 484 F.2d\n1122, 1134 (2d Cir.1973). This Court recognizes that desegregation is not the only goal of national housing\npolicy. See Shannon, 436 F.2d at 822. HUD also has an obligation to generally meet low-income housing needs. \nSee Cole v. Lynn, 389 F.Supp. 99, 102 (D.D.C.1975). This, however, does not mean that HUD can avoid its\naffirmative duty under the Fair Housing Act.\nHUD has interpreted its obligation under the Fair Housing Act through regulations at 24 C.F.R. § 941.202. These\nregulations set forth the factors HUD uses to evaluate proposed sites. The provision at issue in this case\nconcerns levels of minority concentration.\nThe site for new construction projects must not be located in [a]n area of minority concentration\nunless (i) sufficient, comparable opportunities exist for housing for minority families, in the income\nrange to be served by the proposed project, outside areas of minority concentration, or (ii) the\nproject is necessary to meet overriding housing needs which cannot otherwise be feasibly met in\n[3]\nthat housing market area. 24 C.F.R. § 941.202(c)(1).\nHUD's decision to allow PHA to site up to 50% of the replacement housing in areas of minority concentration,\nwas premised on its determination that \"sufficient, comparable opportunities\" existed in non-minority areas of\nProvidence. Plaintiff's expert challenges this assessment. In looking at his assertions alongside the administrative\nrecord, this Court finds that there is a genuine, material, factual issue in dispute which precludes summary\n[4]\njudgment.\nThis Court does not find it necessary at this time to delve into the specific contours of HUD's duty. It would be\n[5]\nmore appropriate to do so when the factual disputes are resolved and the issue has been fully briefed.\n\nC. The Administrative Record\nHUD argues that this Court is not only barred from going beyond the administrative record, but that any sort of\nevidentiary hearing is also precluded. This Court agrees that the primary focus of its inquiry must be the\nadministrative record. See Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 419, 91 S.Ct. at 825. \"The fact that review sometimes or\noften focuses on the initial administrative record [however] does not mean it must, or always, will do so.\" Valley\nCitizens for a Safe Environment v. Aldridge, 886 F.2d 458, 460 (1st Cir.1989). A case may raise genuine issues of\nmaterial fact that require a trial. Id. \"[A] reviewing court might want additional testimony by experts, simply to help\n644 it understand matters in the agency record; indeed, it might ask for additional factual evidence as an *644 aid to\nunderstanding.\" Id. The use of such experts is within a district court's discretion. Id. Moreover, \"[t]he court may\nrequire the administrative officials who participated in the decision to give testimony explaining their action.\" \nOverton Park, 401 U.S. at 420, 91 S.Ct. at 428. In sum, this Court does not feel constrained to limit itself to\nsummary judgment. The parties will, therefore, be allowed, in relation to the HUD claims, to present testimony\n[6]\nfrom experts and agency officials.\nIII. PHA\nThe issue for the PHA is whether its role in the siting of the replacement housing violates the Fair Housing Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 3601 et seq, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, and the equal protection and\ndue process clauses of the fourteenth amendment. PHA contends its role is so intertwined with that of HUD that\nits liability is conditioned on HUD's liability. This Court, however, does not agree. HUD's approval of a site, even if\nthat approval is lawful, does not shield the PHA from liability if it has unlawfully discriminated in selecting sites. \nU.S. v. Yonkers Board of Education, 624 F.Supp. 1276, 1374-75 (S.D.N.Y.1985),aff'd,837 F.2d 1181 (2d\n[7]\nCir.1987),cert. denied,486 U.S. 1055, 108 S.Ct. 2821, 100 L.Ed.2d 922 (1988).  One important consequence\nof reviewing PHA's liability separately is that PHA's actions do not implicate the APA because PHA is not an\nagency of the federal government. The review, therefore, is direct and goes well beyond the administrative\nrecord.\nThe review focuses on whether PHA has intentionally discriminated in the site selection process. The factors to\nbe considered in such a case include \"the degree of any discriminatory effect; the historical background of the\nactions; the specific sequence of events leading up to the actions; [and] the presence or absence of departures\nfrom normal procedures or substantive criteria.\" Id. at 1293 (citing Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan\nHousing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266-68, 97 S.Ct. 555, 563-65, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977)). Plaintiff has\nalleged intentional discrimination detailing a history of discrimination in PHA's handling of public housing and\npointing to indications of discrimination in the present site selection process. For instance, plaintiff notes that in\nthe PHA's initial replacement housing proposal, 180 out of the first 184 units were to be placed in areas of\nminority concentration. In so doing, plaintiff has met its burden of demonstrating that material, factual disputes\nexist. Summary judgment is, therefore, denied.\nIV. Remedy\nIn denying summary judgment, I do not wish to mislead any of the parties. This Court has concerns about the\nrelief that could be awarded if the plaintiff should prevail. This Court \"faces the difficult task of avoiding both\nremedies that may be too intrusive, interfering with HUD's ability to carry out its basic grant-awarding mission,\nand those that may prove to be ineffective.\" NAACP, 817 F.2d at 159. The APA \"does not ordinarily empower a\n[8]\ncourt to order an agency to fund particular projects or to reach particular results.\" Id. at 160.  This is not to say\nthat this Court could not fashion a remedy. I can set aside unlawful agency actions and create other comparable\nremedies. Id. I choose to express these reservations now, as I have in the past, because of my belief that\n645 settlement could accomplish far more *645 than litigation. Once again, I urge the parties to make as their priority\nthe needs of the people of Providence who await the replacement housing.\n\nOrder\nIt is hereby, ordered that the defendants' motions for summary judgment are denied.\n[1] The denial of injunction was affirmed in Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, No. 89-1910, 1st Cir., Oct. 5, 1989. The\nlegal basis for the timetable was rejected by the First Circuit, although alternate grounds were suggested, in \nProject B.A.S.I.C. v. O'Rourke, 907 F.2d 1242 (1st Cir. 1990). The established timetable remains in effect.\n[2] HUD fixed 21.5% as the proper figure because that figure represented the total minority population in\nProvidence at the time of the 1980 census. Plaintiff contends that this figure is not appropriate. They argue that a\nfigure of 15.6% should be used, as that represents the percentage of minority population in the census tract that\nhoused the demolished Hartford Park project.\n[3] Some other factors that HUD considers are access to utilities, adverse environmental conditions, access to\nsocial, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities and job opportunities. 24 C.F.R. § 941.202.\n[4] HUD suggests that this Court should be guided by Aertsen v. Landrieu, 637 F.2d 12 (1st Cir. 1980). In \nAertsen, there was evidence that 229 units in minority concentrated areas were offset by 511 units in non\nminority concentrated areas. Id. at 24. In the instant case, the evidence on comparable housing is not so clear\nand the contrast in numbers not so great; Aertsen, therefore, is not dispositive.\n[5] At this stage in the litigation, the parties have not fully briefed the Fair Housing Act issue. HUD's primary\nargument on summary judgment has revolved around the standard of review under the APA. The plaintiff, on the\nother hand, has focused on whether there is a factual dispute that would preclude summary judgment.\n[6] With regard to the propriety of a trial, this Court notes that other cases against HUD have involved evidentiary\nproceedings. In these cases, the Courts of Appeals, in discussing the APA, did not indicate that these trials were\nimproper. See NAACP, 817 F.2d at 151; Alschuler v. HUD, 515 F.Supp. 1212, 1216 (N.D.Ill. 1981),aff'd,686 F.2d\n472 (7th Cir.1982).\n[7] PHA argues that Yonkers is inapplicable because HUD was no longer in the case when the City of Yonkers'\nliability was determined. This Court, however, is not persuaded that this distinction is significant.\n[8] Although PHA and HUD each stand on their own in terms of liability, the fact that funding comes through HUD\ncontinues to have an effect on the remedy that this Court can fashion.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Co. and\nLloyd T. Griffin.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nPETTINE, Senior District Judge.\nIt is with deep regret and great concern that I revisit this case. Project B.A.S.I.C. began in April 1989 and, in the\nwords of the Providence Housing Authority (\"PHA\"), has involved a \"near-epic saga of litigation.\" On April 12,\n1991, the parties entered into a settlement stipulation. It was my hope at that time the project would run smoothly\nwithout any further intervention by this Court. The possibility of my intervention, however, was left open by the\nterms of the settlement which left in force my decree of July 17, 1989. Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 721 F.Supp.\n1501 (D.R.I.1989). I return to this case now because of a related case, Phoenix-Griffin Group II Ltd. v. Kemp,\nC.A. No. 91-0188P.\nBACKGROUND\nBriefly, this case involves low income housing. A number of units in the City of Providence were demolished and\nnow the PHA and Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") are under an obligation to replace\nthose 240 units of housing. In my original order, I set a deadline for the completion of the replacement housing;\nthat deadline is June 17, 1991. Project B.A.S.I.C., 721 F.Supp. at 1515.\nPhoenix-Griffin Group II Ltd. (\"Phoenix\") is one of the contractors selected by the PHA to build ninety-two of the\nfirst 131 replacement units of scattered site housing. Phoenix has already completed and turned over to PHA\n\nownership fifty-two units. The remaining forty units are in varying stages of construction, although most are near\ncompletion.\nWhen Phoenix started work on the project, it asked PHA whether it would have to pay Davis-Bacon Act wages for\nits employees at its off-site prefabrication plant on Veazie Street. See 40 U.S.C. § 276a et seg. After consulting\nwith the regional HUD office, PHA told Phoenix that it would not have to pay those higher wages. In March 1991,\nPHA was informed by HUD that the United States Department of Labor was conducting an investigation of\nPhoenix's operations and that PHA, therefore, had to withhold $500,000 from the project at least until completion\nof the investigation. This action by the Labor Department and HUD came as a surprise not only to the PHA, but\nalso to Phoenix.\nOn April 15, 1991, Phoenix filed suit to enjoin the withholding of the $500,000. Although nominally a defendant in\nthat action, PHA supports Phoenix's contention that it was given advice by HUD that was, evidently, contrary to\nthe Labor Department's interpretation of the Davis-Bacon Act. Phoenix alleges that without that $500,000 it\ncannot continue construction; its line of credit cannot withstand that loss. As a result, work will stop and those in\ndire need of the replacement housing, the poor and homeless of Providence, will not have decent housing.\nThis case is a classic example of two arms of the federal government battling over their respective domains. The\n24 battle has created a nightmare not only for this *24 Court, but for those who have labored so long to provide new\nlow income housing and for those who await it. Both agencies make respectable arguments with regard to the\nregulations within their own realms, but they refuse to look past those regulations. This Court has overseen the\nProject B.A.S.I.C. litigation from the beginning and my paramount concern has always been to provide sorely\nneeded housing as expeditiously as possible. It was with these needs in mind that I instructed the parties to \nPhoenix-Griffin, most of whom are also parties to Project B.A.S.I.C., to brief for me the issues surrounding the\npossible issuance of a contempt decree based on my ordered June 17, 1991 deadline for the completion of\nhousing. For the following reasons, I have decided that I will hold HUD in contempt, once the deadline passes, if\nit continues to impede the completion of the project.\nDISCUSSION\nIt is beyond dispute that this Court has the inherent equitable power to enforce its July 17, 1989 order with civil\ncontempt and to impose fines for non-compliance. See Morales-Feliciano v. Parole Board of Puerto Rico, 887\nF.2d 1, 4-6 (1st Cir.1989),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 1511, 108 L.Ed.2d 646 (1990). Clearly,\nimpossibility is a defense to contempt. Oriel v. Russell, 278 U.S. 358, 365-66, 49 S.Ct. 173, 175, 73 L.Ed. 419\n(1929). There need not be wilful defiance to find a party in contempt, nor will a showing of substantial compliance\nwith a court's order excuse a party. Morales, 887 F.2d at 4-5. \"Good faith alone is not a defense to civil\ncontempt.... [I]mpossibility would be a defense to contempt, ... [but] the test of impossibility may be particularly\nstrict [where] the needs of [the plaintiffs] are urgent.\" Id. at 5 (citations omitted).\nThe PHA has demonstrated to this Court that it will be truly impossible for it to comply with my order. As\nwitnessed by this Court, the PHA has made a diligent effort to comply with the order. The matter, however, has\nbeen taken out of its hands by the federal government. PHA derives all of its funding for this project from HUD,\nand PHA is now under a direct order from HUD to withhold the monies on the basis of the Labor Department's\ninstructions. There is nothing within PHA's power that can change this scenario. PHA, therefore, can assert the\ndefense of impossibility.\nHUD, however, \"has not shown that causes beyond its control have made it overwhelmingly difficult or anywhere\nnear impossible\" to move this project closer to completion. See id. HUD has it within its power and discretion to\nissue a \"change-order\" which would authorize additional funding to cover the Labor Department lien and allow\nPhoenix to complete the remaining forty units. Although I specifically instructed HUD to point out to this Court any\nimpediment to its issuance of such a change-order, HUD could point to no such provision and instead stressed its\n\"full discretionary power\" over expenditures.\nRather than focusing on an impossibility defense, HUD has chosen to argue primarily that my original order was\nnot directed against it. Although HUD was clearly a defendant in Project B.A.S.I.C., my order stated:\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the PHA proceed as soon as possible to begin construction of the\n240 public housing units, funded by HUD.... The PHA is ordered to complete construction of all\n240 units of replacement housing within 23 months of the date of this Opinion. 721 F.Supp. at\n1515.\nBefore addressing this defense, I must first state that my clear intention at the time of the order was to bind HUD\nas well as the PHA. Without HUD's continued funding and approval, the PHA could not go forward with the\nproject.\nThe cases cited by HUD in support of the proposition that a contempt decree cannot be directed against it all\nspeak in generalities and none hold that a party is not bound by a court's order. See e.g., Spallone v. U.S., 493\nU.S. 265, 110 S.Ct. 625, 631, 107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990) (contempt not proper against non-party legislator). There\n25 is no doubt that HUD was a party 00 it was *25 a named defendant in Project B.A.S.I.C. Moreover, the policies\n97\nthat counsel against holding a non-party in contempt do not apply to HUD. \"The central reason that one who is\nnot a party to the action in which the injunction was issued cannot be bound by it is that he has not had his day in\ncourt with respect to the validity of the injunction.\" G & C Merriam Co. v. Webster Dictionary Co., 639 F.2d 29, 37\n(1st Cir.1980) (emphasis in original).\nHUD has most certainly had its day in court. It has been a defendant in Project B.A.S.I.C. from the inception of\nthe case. HUD has vigorously defended its position in the action; in fact, it was often HUD who prepared briefs,\nwith PHA simply joining. HUD appealed the order in question to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, something it\n[1]\ncertainly would not have done had it thought the order did not apply to the agency.  Finally, HUD actively\nparticipated in negotiations and signed onto the settlement stipulation in Project B.A.S.I.C. If HUD had ever truly\ndoubted whether it was bound by my order, it could have easily petitioned this Court for a clarification. See Regal\nKnitwear Co. v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 9, 15, 65 S.Ct. 478, 481, 89 L.Ed. 661 (1945); Moore's Federal Practice, ¶ 65.13\n(2d Ed. 1990).\nMoreover, there are situations in which a court can direct a contempt order against a non-party. See e.g., New\nYork State Nat'l Organization for Women v. Terry, 732 F.Supp. 388, 399-400 (S.D.N.Y.1990). These cases are\nbased on the provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d) which allow an injunction to bind \"those persons in active concert\nor participation\" with parties. This rule also covers those who are \"legally identified\" with the named parties. See \nG & C Merriam, 639 F.2d at 35. For a fully involved participant such as HUD to essentially claim immunity strains\nlogic when even non-parties can, in fact, be bound by an order they had no opportunity to attack.\nHUD has argued that it would be contrary to public policy to hold it in contempt. HUD asserts that by providing\nadditional monies, this Court would be rewarding Phoenix for its violation of prevailing wage laws. HUD further\ncontends that such court action would encourage other contractors involved in public housing to breach wage\nlaws with the expectation that HUD will make up the difference. HUD's argument, however, is flawed. First of all,\nit is the poor people of Providence awaiting housing who are the primary beneficiaries of my actions, not Phoenix.\nSecondly, Phoenix's situation is unique. Phoenix, constructing housing ordered built by this Court, relied upon\nHUD's assurance (through the PHA) that the wage law did not apply to the Veazie Street site. This situation is not\napt to be easily replicated.\nBased on the briefs submitted and the reasons that I have set out above, I am prepared to hold HUD in civil\ncontempt without further hearing. See Morales, 887 F.2d at 6-7 (briefs alone may provide adequate opportunity to\nbe heard). This Court is convinced that the July 17, 1989 order binds HUD and that HUD cannot prove the\ndefense of impossibility. HUD has the power and discretion to grant a change-order which would allow the project\nto continue. Until such time as HUD has done everything within its power to move the project toward completion,\nit cannot convince this Court that it is acting in compliance with my order.\nIf the June 17, 1991 deadline passes and HUD has not issued a change-order or otherwise ensured the swift\ncompletion of the forty replacement units being constructed by Phoenix, I will find them in civil contempt. In order\nto coerce compliance with my order, I will initially fine the agency $250,000. I will continue to fine it at a rate of\n$2,000 a day until HUD removes all barriers to completion within its control. The fine will be capped at $500,000\n26 and any monies collected by this Court shall be applied *26 toward completion of the housing.[2] Because the\n\ndeadline is so near, I will stay execution of this order until June 27, 1991. I am granting HUD this additional time\nto allow it to take whatever steps may be necessary to comply with my Order. On June 27, 1991, if HUD has not\ncomplied, the fine will be imposed automatically without further action of this Court.\nI have carefully evaluated this fine in terms of \"the character and magnitude of the harm threatened by continued\ncontumacy, and the probable effectiveness of [the] ... sanction in bringing about the result desired.\" G & C\nMerriam, 639 F.2d at 41. The harm of HUD's contumacy is truly beyond calculation. Not only will those families\nwho have been awaiting public housing for years be denied that housing for an indeterminable period of time, but\nthe housing that is nearly complete will lay fallow and deteriorate while HUD and the Labor Department do battle.\nThe sanction I am imposing may break the stalemate. If not, it will provide the funding necessary to get Project\nB.A.S.I.C. back on its feet.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] HUD relies on Project B.A.S.I.C. v. O'Rourke, 907 F.2d 1242 (1st Cir.1990) for its argument that the order was\ndirected solely at PHA. There had been a challenge regarding HUD's standing to appeal on the basis that HUD\nwas not a party to the order. The First Circuit, however, found it unnecessary to reach this issue as PHA clearly\nhad standing.

(\"BASIC\"), a Rhode Island tenant-advocacy organization, asked the federal\ndistrict court to issue a preliminary injunction forbidding the Providence Housing Authority (and the federal\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development) from demolishing several high-rise towers at the Hartford Park\nhousing project in Providence. BASIC claimed that the proposed demolition violated several federal statutes,\nincluding 42 U.S.C. § 1437p, which says that HUD must approve all such demolitions and prohibits HUD from\ngiving its approval unless certain conditions are met. The district court denied BASIC's request for an injunction.\nWe affirmed that denial on appeal. See Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 721 F.Supp. 1501 (D.R.I.1989),aff'd mem.,\nNo. 89-1910 (1st Cir. Oct. 5, 1989), on denial of reh'g, No. 89-1910 (1st Cir. Oct. 12, 1989). Since then, PHA has\ndemolished the towers.\nIn the same opinion in which it denied BASIC's request, the district court ordered PHA to,\nproceed as soon as possible to begin construction of the 240 public housing units, funded by\nHUD, needed to replace the 240 units lost due to the past and planned demolition of the high-\nrises.... [and] to complete construction of all 240 units of replacement housing within 23 months of\nthe date of this Opinion [i.e., by June 17, 1991].\n721 F.Supp. at 1515. PHA and HUD now appeal from this \"time schedule\" injunctive order. We agree with PHA\nand HUD that the particular reason given by the district court for its injunctive order does not provide that order\n\nwith adequate legal support. Nonetheless, the court may have had other adequate legal grounds for issuing the\norder. We therefore remand for further consideration by the district court.\nI\nPreliminary Matters\nBASIC raises several procedural or jurisdictional objections to PHA's (and HUD's) appeal from what amounts to a\npreliminary injunction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) (authorizing interlocutory appeals from district court orders\n1244 granting *1244 injunctions). First, it suggests that our earlier decision in this case somehow forecloses this\nappeal. That earlier decision, however, concerned BASIC's appeal from the district court's denial of its request for\ninjunctive relief. This appeal concerns the district court's granting of a \"time schedule\" order. The legal questions\nwe decided then do not dispose of the cross-appeal before us now.\nSecond, BASIC says that appellants may not now argue that the \"time schedule\" order is unlawful because they\nfailed to raise this issue in the district court. Appellants did not do so, however, because the district court entered\nthat order sua sponte, at the same time that it denied BASIC's request for an injunction. The appellants might\nhave sought a rehearing before appealing, but the law did not require them to do so.\nThird, BASIC suggests that appellants expressly waived any objection to the \"time schedule\" order in a brief\nsubmitted to the district court. They point out that, although the appellants did not ask for rehearing after the\ndistrict court issued its memorandum and order, BASIC did ask for a rehearing; and, when appellants opposed\nBASIC's rehearing request, they not only failed to complain about the \"time schedule\" order, but also said they\nwould comply with that order. To be specific, PHA, in its opposition to BASIC's motion for reconsideration, stated\nthat,\nthe [district] Court has ordered the replacement housing to be constructed within twenty-three (23)\nmonths, which PHA fully intends to do.\n(Emphasis added.) This statement, however, was merely a single, isolated sentence appearing in an opposition\nbrief that made no reference whatsoever to the possibility of appellate review. Consequently, we cannot treat it as\na waiver of the PHA's right to appeal.\nFourth, BASIC says that HUD lacks standing to appeal the order, for the order tells PHA, not HUD, what to do.\nRegardless, PHA has standing, and it also appeals. Hence, we need not consider whether HUD has standing as\nwell. See Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 682, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 2014, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977); \nArlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 555, 562 n. 9, 50 L.Ed.2d\n450 (1977).\nII\nLegal bases for the district court's order\nA. The amended version of 42 U.S.C. § 1437p\nThe appellants argue that the district court's \"time schedule\" order rests upon a legal mistake. The district court\nbased its order upon language in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, Pub.L. No. 100-242, §\n121, 101 Stat. 1815, 1837-39, which amended the \"HUD demolition permission\" statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1437p. This\namendment took effect in 1988 on the day after HUD approved the PHA's request to demolish the project's\ntowers. (We shall refer to it as the \"1988 amendment.\")\nBefore the basic statute was amended, it prohibited HUD from granting a demolition request unless (among other\nthings) the local housing agency undertaking demolition had consulted with affected tenants and made provision\n\nfor relocating them to new housing. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437p(b)(1, 2). As amended, the statute imposes the\nadditional condition that the public housing agency must have \"developed a plan\" for replacing the demolished\nhousing. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437p(b)(3). The plan must include, for example,\na schedule for completing the plan within a period consistent with the size of the proposed\ndemolition ..., except that the schedule shall in no event exceed 6 years.\n42 U.S.C. § 1437p(b)(3)(D).\nThe district court recognized that the amendment's requirement of a housing replacement plan (and related\nschedule) did not apply to HUD's approval of the demolition project, for HUD approved the PHA's demolition\nrequest before the 1988 amendment's effective date. The district court believed, however, that the amendment's\n1245 requirement did apply to PHA's demolition *1245 activities, because these activities were scheduled to take place\nafter the amendment's effective date. Indeed, PHA, when it applied for demolition approval in January 1988, had\nsubmitted a 23-month replacement-housing schedule (with completion scheduled for December 1989). The court\nnoted that PHA had fallen behind that schedule. It concluded that the statutory language quoted above\nauthorized it to order PHA to comply at least with a more generous revised schedule requiring completion by\nJune 1991.\nWe previously held that the 1988 amendment does not apply to a \"HUD approval\" given before the amendment\ntook effect. See Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, No. 89-1910 (1st Cir. Oct. 5, 1989) (mem.), aff'g721 F.Supp. 1501\n(D.R.I.1989). We now conclude, similarly, that the amendment does not apply to the post-amendment activities\n(of the sort at issue here) of a public housing authority that requested and received HUD's approval before the\namendment took effect. Our reasons are as follows.\nFirst, the literal language of the amended statute, although ambiguous, somewhat favors the view that the\namendment does not apply to demolitions that HUD approved before the amendment's effective date, even if the\napproved demolition actually takes place subsequently. The statute, as we explained earlier, enumerates\nconditions that must be met before HUD may approve a request to demolish public housing. See 42 U.S.C. §§\n1437p(a, b). The 1988 amendment added a number of new conditions, which appear in § 1437p(b)(3). (For ease\nof reference, the entire statute is set out in an appendix to this opinion.)\nSection 1437p(b), as amended, consists of one long sentence. It says, in condensed form,\nThe Secretary may not approve an application [for demolition] ... unless ... the application from the\npublic housing agency [(1) has been developed in consultation with tenants, (2) provides for\ntenant relocation, and unless] (3) the public housing agency has developed a plan for the\nprovision of ... additional ... public housing ..., which plan [satisfies a host of specific detailed\nconditions, including scheduling conditions].\n42 U.S.C. § 1437p(b) (emphasis added). This long sentence refers to, and limits, the authority of \"the Secretary\"\n(the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, see 42 U.S.C. § 1437a(8)). It explains which demolition\napplications \"the Secretary\" may or may not approve. It speaks of a housing-replacement plan only insofar as it\nmakes a public housing agency's developing such a plan a prerequisite for obtaining \"the Secretary['s]\" approval\nof a demolition application. It says nothing about imposing new requirements upon public housing agencies that\nhave already received the Secretary's approval for their demolition applications. Such applications would have\nbeen approved if, and only if, the proposed demolition met the conditions in §§ 1437p(b)(1) & (2) and in § 1437p\n(a) (which also begins \"The Secretary may not approve an application [to demolish housing] ... unless the\nSecretary has determined that\" certain conditions are met). What, in the language of this sentence, suggests that\na housing agency must develop a different housing-replacement plan after it had received the necessary\napproval? What suggests that only the housing agency, but not \"the Secretary,\" must (in some circumstances)\ncomply with § 1437p(b)(3)? How could one read this language to reach that result?\nOther statutory language added by the 1988 amendment provides a possible answer to these questions. This\nlanguage appears in new subsection 1437p(d), and it says that a,\n\npublic housing agency shall not take any action to demolish or dispose of a public housing project\n... without obtaining the approval of the Secretary and satisfying the conditions specified in\nsubsections (a) and (b) of this section.\nThe words \"subsections (a) and (b)\" refer to §§ 1437p(a) & (b), which we discussed in the last paragraph. BASIC\nreads these words as imposing a separate and independent obligation upon the housing agency to comply with\n1246 the conditions in §§ 1437p(a) & (b), including the new housing-replacement-plan *1246\nrequirement in § 1437p(b)(3), even where the Secretary need not comply.\nThe words in § 1437p(d), however, do not say that a public housing agency must satisfy \"conditions\" in addition\nto those that must be met to obtain HUD's approval. On the contrary, it says that a PHA must satisfy \"the\nconditions in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section,\" which, as we have explained, are precisely the conditions\nthat must be met in order to obtain HUD's approval. The most natural way to read these words is as if they said\nthat the public housing agency \"must satisfy the subsection (a) and (b) conditions that the Secretary must\ndetermine are satisfied before the Secretary may grant approval.\" Read this way, the provision means that, if\nHUD's approval is necessary for a demolition project, the public housing agency has an independent legal\nobligation to satisfy whatever conditions are necessary for HUD's approval. This was not well-understood under\npre-amendment law, see Edwards v. District of Columbia, 821 F.2d 651 (D.C.Cir.1987) (holding that § 1437p did\nnot prevent a public housing agency from \"constructively demolishing\" a project through neglect without HUD's\napproval), and the legislative history shows that Congress enacted § 1437p(d) to correct this misunderstanding, \nsee H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 426, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 172 (1987), reprinted in 1987 U.S.Code Cong. &\nAdmin.News 3317, 3458, 3469.\nAs we have already explained, the creation of a § 1437p(b)(3) housing-replacement plan with a related schedule \nwas not a condition of HUD's approval here, because that approval was given before § 1437p(b)(3) took effect.\nConsequently, PHA was not obligated by § 1437p(d) to submit such a plan. Nothing in the legislative history of §\n1437p(d) suggests that Congress intended the amendment to impose a greater obligation upon the public\nhousing agency than upon HUD, or to impose obligations upon the public housing agency that were not also\npreconditions of HUD's approval. See id. Rather, the history suggests that § 1437p(d)'s purpose was simply to\nchange the result in Edwards, a purpose that has little, if any-thing, to do with the present pre-amendment\napproval/post-amendment demolition problem. Without special help from the language of § 1437p(d), the\nlanguage in § 1437p(b) suggests that the 1988 amendment does not apply to PHA's pre-approved plan.\nSecond, even were we to find the statutory language completely ambiguous, we should still have to accept\nappellants' interpretation in light of basic legal principles of statutory interpretation. For one thing, a canon of\ninterpretation governing \"grants\" suggests that the amendment does not apply to the PHA's demolition in this\ncase, a demolition approved before the amendment took effect. The Supreme Court has said that, because it is\ndifficult, and sometimes unfair, to make a grantholder abide by new (post-grant) statutory obligations, a grant-\nholder's obligations normally should be \"evaluated by the law in effect when the grants were made,\" Bennett v.\nNew Jersey, 470 U.S. 632, 640, 105 S.Ct. 1555, 1560, 84 L.Ed.2d 572 (1985) (emphasis added), not by the law\n\"in effect at the time\" the court \"renders its decision,\" Bradley v. School Board, 416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006,\n2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). Elaborating, the Court stated,\n\"Absent a clear indication to the contrary in the relevant statutes or legislative history, changes in\nthe substantive standards governing federal grant programs do not alter obligations and liabilities\narising under earlier grants.\"\nBennett, 470 U.S. at 641, 105 S.Ct. at 1561. The PHA is literally a grantholder, for when HUD approved its\ndemolition project it also provided funds (or, in the words of § 1437p, \"furnished aid\") to carry out that demolition. \nCf. Edwards, 821 F.2d at 652 (opinion of Wald, C.J.) (noting that § 1437p is part of \"a fairly typical federal grant-\nin-aid program\" that conditions approval and funding for housing-related activities on compliance with certain\nstatutory requirements). For purposes of this canon of construction, approval of a demolition project seems\nfunctionally equivalent to the award of a federal grant.\n1247\n\n*1247 For another thing, the statutory language BASIC asks us to interpret is closely tied to the practical\nworkings of a major federal administrative program and plays a minor, interstitial role within the statutory scheme\ncreating that program. Under circumstances such as these, we must accord \"considerable weight\" to HUD's own\ninterpretation of the statute, an interpretation that HUD not only offers on this appeal, but which it also has\ncodified in a regulation specifically exempting from the reach of the 1988 amendments \"units approved for\ndeprogramming before February 5, 1988.\" See 24 C.F.R. § 970.2(g) (1989); Chevron, Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1983); Power Reactor Dev. Co. v.\nInternational Union of Elec. Workers, 367 U.S. 396, 408, 81 S.Ct. 1529, 1535, 6 L.Ed.2d 924 (1961)\n(contemporaneous statutory constructions are especially deserving of respect); Mayburg v. HHS, 740 F.2d 100,\n106 (1st Cir.1984). (As to the regulation's applicability here, see 24 C.F.R. § 990.102 (1989) (defining \"unit\napproved for deprogramming\"); HUD Handbook 7486.1 ¶ 1-3.h (1986); 49 Fed.Reg. 22663, 22663 (May 31,\n1984) (proposed rule); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); Bowles v.\nSeminole Rock Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945) (\"[A] court must necessarily\nlook to the administrative construction of [a] regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt.\").)\nThird, HUD's interpretation of the statute is an extremely reasonable one, for applying the new statutory\nconditions to public housing agencies that received HUD approval before those new conditions took effect could\ncreate serious practical problems. A glance at § 1437p(b)(3) reveals that many of the new conditions (such as the\nrequirement in paragraph \"(B)(1)\" that the Secretary find \"project-based assistance\" not \"feasible\") are not only\ndetailed and complex but would require public housing agencies with approved demolition proposals to make a\nreturn trip to HUD. Some of these public housing agencies might, however, already have demolished portions of\nprojects; others might be all set to begin demolition. Although some agencies might find it easy to stop and to\nprepare a complex housing-replacement plan, others might find it both difficult and costly to do so. It is difficult to\nbelieve Congress intended to apply the complex and detailed new housing-replacement requirement to all\nuncompleted demolitions without saying a word about such potential problems, yet we do not see how, if we\nadopt BASIC's reading of the statute, one could avoid those problems. See Tillman v. Housing Auth., No.\n88-0211 (W.D.Pa. Feb. 17, 1988) (order denying preliminary injunction) (\"[I]t would be absurd and unreasonable\nto apply the requirements of [§ 1437p(b)(3)] to demolitions that have already been commenced in compliance\nwith the old law.\").\nWe recognize, as BASIC points out, that Congressman Henry Gonzalez, a sponsor of the 1988 amendments,\ntold HUD that Congress intended those amendments to \"apply to those situations\" in which \"a public housing\nauthority has previously secured HUD approval for demolition....\" See Letter from Representative Henry B.\nGonzalez to Samuel R. Pierce, Jr., Secretary of HUD (May 4, 1988). He added that \"nothing in the statute\nprovides a waiver of these requirements for projects that received approval prior to [the effective date of the 1988\namendment] but have not yet been demolished.\" Id. This statement, however, was written after the 1988\namendment became law. It simply is not sufficient, in our view, to overcome the linguistic, the practical, the\nadministrative, and the grant-related interpretive concerns that we have previously mentioned. Cf. American\nHosp. Ass'n v. NLRB, 899 F.2d 651 (7th Cir.1990) (discussing limited value of post-enactment legislative\nstatements). Consequently, we are not persuaded by that letter nor by the single district court case that has held\nto the contrary, see Walker v. HUD, 734 F.Supp. 1289,appeal docketed, No. 89-1914 (5th Cir.1989).\nB. Alternative legal bases\n1248 Even though the 1988 amendment to 42 U.S.C. § 1437p cannot, on its own, *1248 provide legal support for the\ndistrict court's \"time schedule\" order, alternative grounds may well do so. For one thing, the unamended statute\nprohibited HUD from approving demolition unless,\nall tenants to be displaced as a result of the demolition ... are relocated to other decent, safe,\nsanitary, and affordable housing....\n42 U.S.C. § 1437p(b)(2). The record strongly suggests that HUD would not (and perhaps legally could not) have\nfound that this \"relocation\" condition was satisfied without PHA's plan to build new housing according to a time\nschedule roughly approximating the schedule that PHA submitted along with its demolition application.\n\nFor example, when PHA initially applied for permission to demolish the project towers in June 1987, it told HUD\nthat,\nunless units proposed for demolition are replaced, the [PHA] would have relocation problems\nduring the reconstruction of the remainder of the project.\nIn August 1987, HUD's own Providence office manager told HUD that,\nClearly, the [relocation] requirements of the [unamended statute] ... cannot be met unless\nreplacement housing funds are made available.\nIn January 1988, as part of its demolition application, PHA submitted to HUD a \"Time Table for Demolition and\nReplacement Housing\" which indicated that \"construction of replacement housing\" would begin in October 1988\nand would finish a year later, seven months before demolition of the towers. When it approved the project on\nFebruary 4, 1988, HUD expressly referred to \"the replacement of units with 184 new public housing units and 120\nvouchers.\"\nAs appellants point out, PHA made various revisions in the schedules and a HUD regional office director wrote,\n\"time schedules for demolition, replacement housing, and modernization activities will be revised.\" But there is no\nindication that any such revisions foresaw significant delays. To the contrary, the HUD regional office director\nmade clear that she thought schedule revision meant speeding up, not slowing down, the construction schedule.\nGiven this type of record evidence, the district court may have believed (1) that demolition could lawfully proceed\nonly if PHA and HUD could show the \"relocation\" requirement satisfied, and (2) that PHA and HUD could make\nsuch a showing only if housing replacement proceeded along a time schedule that roughly resembled the\nschedule initially submitted. Believing this, the district court might have denied BASIC's motion for a preliminary\ninjunction against the demolition on condition that the PHA replace the demolished housing according to a\nschedule no more stringent (in fact, considerably less stringent) than the time schedule PHA had itself proposed. \nCf. Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37 (D.C.Cir.1985) (per curiam) (district court properly dismissed challenge to\nlawfulness of agency action while \"incorporat[ing] the agency's chosen course of action\" into its final order).\nMoreover, had appellants asked for rehearing below, and made to the district court the legal argument they make\nhere, the district court might well have shifted its legal ground and made the condition explicit before permitting\nthe demolition to proceed. Given the record, the general tenor of the district court's opinion, and a district court's\nlegal authority to impose appropriate conditions upon a grant or denial of a request for preliminary injunction, cf. \nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982), this argument, which\nBASIC advances, is a strong one.\nFor another thing, BASIC told the district court that demolition of the towers, without adequate replacement\nhousing, would violate other federal statutes, such as the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., and Title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq., because, without that replacement housing, the\ndemolition would adversely and disproportionately affect racial minorities. The district court refused to enjoin\ndemolition on this basis, in part, it said, because \"the demolition is to be compensated for by the construction of\n1249 replacement housing ... in appropriate areas....\" 721 F.Supp. at *1249 1517. The court added that PHA should not\ndemolish the towers unless it built replacement housing, for the \"citizens of Providence are entitled to equate the\ndemolition of the high-rises with the PHA's promise that it can and will build the 240 units of replacement\nhousing.\" Id. Again, in evaluating the merits of these alternative statutory arguments, the court may have viewed\nthe \"time schedule\" order as a necessary condition justifying its refusal to enjoin the demolition. See Spring Mills,\nInc. v. Ultracashmere House, Ltd., 724 F.2d 352, 355 (2d Cir.1983) (district court's discretion to fashion\nreasonable injunctive remedies is wide).\nFinally, BASIC argues that, even if the court did not make its \"time schedule\" order a condition of the denial of\npreliminary injunctive relief, BASIC has a legal right to enforce the \"time schedule\" promise, either (1) because it\nhas a legal right directly to enforce the statute's \"relocation\" requirement, cf. Edwards, 821 F.2d at 658 n. 7, 660\n& n. 12 (opinion of Wald, C.J.); id. at 666 (Will, J., dissenting), or (2) because it has a legal right, as beneficiary of\na critically important promise that PHA made to HUD, to hold the PHA to that promise.\n\nBy setting forth these arguments, we do not now hold that they provide sufficient legal support for the court's\n\"time schedule\" order. Rather, we intend only to show that, in the context of the record before us, these\narguments (or at least some of them) are highly plausible. The fact is that the district court has not had an\nopportunity to consider these arguments, and the parties have not fully briefed all of them here. Because many of\nthese arguments may turn on the district court's view of the case and its reasons for denying the preliminary\ninjunction, we think it is important for the district court to consider them before we do.\nWe also note that PHA, at oral argument, told us that construction is in progress and may well be complete by\nJune 1991, the deadline contained in the district court's order. That being so, and HUD (through this opinion)\nhaving achieved its objective of clarifying legal precedent, the parties may find that they no longer disagree about\nthe order, particularly since PHA remains free to seek modification should unforeseen construction difficulties\noccur.\nRegardless, we find BASIC's arguments sufficiently compelling to warrant leaving the injunctive order in place\nprovisionally. The district court should reconsider the legal basis for its order if appellants request it to do so.\nBASIC may respond by presenting to the district court the arguments it has outlined here (and additional\narguments).\nSo ordered.\nSTATUTORY APPENDIX\n§ 1437p. Demolition and disposition of public housing\n(a) Obsolescence; best-interests transfers; use of proceeds\nThe Secretary may not approve an application by a public housing agency for permission, with or without\nfinancial assistance under this chapter, to demolish or dispose of a public housing project or a portion of a public\nhousing project unless the Secretary has determined that 00\n97\n(1) in the case of an application proposing demolition of a public housing project or a portion of a\npublic housing project, the project or portion of the project is obsolete as to physical condition,\nlocation, or other factors, making it unusable for housing purposes, and no reasonable program of\nmodifications is feasible to return the project or portion of the project to useful life; or in the case of\nan application proposing the demolition of only a portion of a project, the demolition will help to\nassure the useful life of the remaining portion of the project; or\n(2) in the case of an application proposing disposition of real property of a public housing agency\nby sale or other transfer 00\n97\n(A)(i) the property's retention is not in the best interests of the tenants or the public housing\n1250 agency because developmental changes in the area surrounding *1250 the project adversely\naffect the health or safety of the tenants or the feasible operation of the project by the public\nhousing agency, because disposition allows the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other\nproperties which will be more efficiently or effectively operated as lower income housing projects\nand which will preserve the total amount of lower income housing stock available in the\ncommunity, or because of other factors which the Secretary determines are consistent with the\nbest interests of the tenants and public housing agency and which are not inconsistent with other\nprovisions of this chapter; and\n(ii) for property other than dwelling units, the property is excess to the needs of a project or the\ndisposition is incidental to, or does not interfere with, continued operation of a project; and\n(B) the net proceeds of the disposition will be used for (i) the payment of development cost for the\nproject and for the retirement of outstanding obligations issued to finance original development or\nmodernization of the project, and (ii) to the extent that any proceeds remain after the application of\n\nproceeds in accordance with clause (i), the provision of housing assistance for lower income\nfamilies through such measures as modernization of lower income housing, or the acquisition,\ndevelopment, or rehabilitation of other properties to operate as lower income housing.\n(b) Consultation with tenants and tenant councils; relocation assistance; replacement housing plan\nThe Secretary may not approve an application or furnish assistance under this section or under this chapter\nunless 00\n97\n(1) the application from the public housing agency has been developed in consultation with\ntenants and tenant councils, if any, who will be affected by the demolition or disposition and\ncontains a certification by appropriate local government officials that the proposed activity is\nconsistent with the applicable housing assistance plan;\n(2) all tenants to be displaced as a result of the demolition or disposition will be given assistance\nby the public housing agency and are relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable\nhousing, which is, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their choice, including housing\nassisted under section 1437f of this title; and\n(3) the public housing agency has developed a plan for the provision of an additional decent, safe,\nsanitary, and affordable dwelling unit for each public housing dwelling unit to be demolished or\ndisposed under such application, which plan 00\n97\n(A) provides for the provision of such additional dwelling units through 00\n97\n(i) the acquisition or development of additional public housing dwelling units;\n(ii) the use of 15-year project-based assistance under section 1437f of this title;\n(iii) the use of not less than 15-year project-based assistance under other Federal programs;\n(iv) the acquisition or development of dwelling units assisted under a State or local government\nprogram that provides for project-based assistance comparable in terms of eligibility, contribution\nto rent, and length of assistance contract (not less than 15 years) to assistance under section\n1437f(b)(1) of this title;\n(v) the use of 15-year tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title (excluding\nvouchers under section 1437f(o) of this title; or\n(vi) any combination of such methods;\n(B) if it provides for the use of tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title, may be\napproved 00\n97\n1251 (i) only after a finding by the Secretary that replacement with project-based *1251 assistance is\nnot feasible, and the supply of private rental housing actually available to those who would receive\nsuch assistance under the plan is sufficient for the total number of certificates and vouchers\navailable in the community after implementation of the plan and that such supply is likely to remain\navailable for the full 15-year term of the assistance; and\n(ii) only if such finding is based on objective information, which shall include rates of participation\nby landlords in the section 1437f of this title program, size, conditions and rent levels of available\nrental housing as compared to section 1437f of this title standards, the supply of vacant existing\nhousing meeting the section 1437f of this title quality standards with rents at or below the fair\nmarket rent or the likelihood of adjusting the fair market rent, the number of eligible families\nwaiting for public housing or housing assistance under section 1437f of this title and the extent of\ndiscrimination against the types of individuals or families to be served by the assistance;\n(C) is approved by the unit of general local government in which the project is located;\n\n(D) includes a schedule for completing the plan within a period consistent with the size of the\nproposed demolition or disposition, except that the schedule shall in no event exceed 6 years;\n(E) includes a method of ensuring that the same number of individuals and families will be\nprovided housing;\n(F) provides for the payment of the relocation expenses of each tenant to be displaced and\nensures that the rent paid by the tenant following relocation will not exceed the amount permitted\nunder this chapter; and\n(G) prevents the taking of any action to demolish or dispose of any unit until the tenant of the unit\nis relocated to decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing that is, to the extent practicable, of\nthe tenant's choice.\n(c) Financial assistance; annual contributions; funding of replacement housing plan\n(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary is authorized to make available\nfinancial assistance for applications approved under this section using available contributions\nauthorized under section 1437c of this title.\n(2) The Secretary shall, upon approving a plan under subsection (b)(3) of this section, agree to\ncommit (subject to the availability of future appropriations) the funds necessary to carry out the\nplan over the approved schedule of the plan.\n(3) The Secretary shall, in allocating assistance for the acquisition or development of public\nhousing or for moderate rehabilitation under section 1437f(e)(2) of this title, give consideration to\nhousing that replaces demolished public housing units in accordance with a plan under subsection\n(b)(3) of this section.\n(d) Conditions for agency action\nA public housing agency shall not take any action to demolish or dispose of a public housing project or a portion\nof a public housing project without obtaining the approval of the Secretary and satisfying the conditions specified\nin subsections (a) and (b) of this section.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

We granted a stay and expedited appellate proceedings. We now\nreverse.\nI. BACKGROUND\nWe begin by tracing the contours of the two earlier proceedings which together gave rise to the present appeal.\nA. The Original Litigation (PB-I and PB-II).\nSimmering hostilities erupted into public view when Project B.A.S.I.C. (BASIC), a tenant-advocacy organization,\nasked the federal district court to enjoin the Providence Housing Authority (PHA) from tearing down certain\nportions of an antiquated public housing project known as Hartford Park, located in Providence, Rhode Island.\nThe district court denied BASIC's motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the scheduled demolition. Project\nB.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 721 F.Supp. 1501, 1518 (D.R.I.1989) (PB-I). We affirmed that denial without a published\nopinion. PHA proceeded to pulverize the structures.\nThere was more to PB-I, however, than the request for prohibitory injunctive relief. Thus, in addition to denying\nthe prohibitory restrainer, the district court also entered the following decree:\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the PHA proceed as soon as possible to begin construction of the\n240 public housing units, funded by HUD, needed to replace the 240 units lost due to the past and\nplanned demolition of the highrises at Hartford Park. The PHA is ordered to complete construction\n14 of all 240 units of replacement housing within 23 months *14 of the date of this Opinion [July 17,\n1989].\nPB-I,721 F.Supp. at 1515. In a separate appeal, we ruled that the legal grounds adduced by the district court to\njustify this mandatory injunction (which we shall refer to as the 1989 Order) were inadequate to that end. Project\nB.A.S.I.C. v. O'Rourke, 907 F.2d 1242, 1243-47 (1st Cir.1990) (PB-II). We noted, nonetheless, that the 1989\nOrder might be supportable on other grounds. Id. at 1247-49. For this reason, and mindful of the prospect that\n\"the parties may ... no longer disagree about the order,\" id. at 1249, we did not vacate the 1989 Order but left it\n\"in place provisionally,\" with directions to the district court to \"reconsider the legal basis for its order if [the parties]\nrequest it to do so.\" Id.\nOn remand, no such request was made. Rather, the litigants' energies appear to have been expended principally\non an amicable resolution of the underlying problems which had, in the first instance, fomented the law suit. In\nApril 1991, with the district court's approval, the parties entered into a series of settlement stipulations and\nconsent orders designed to resolve the main dispute over the construction of replacement public housing.\nB. The Second Litigation (Phoenix-I).\nMuch of the replacement housing was being developed by Phoenix-Griffin Group II, Ltd. and built by its affiliate,\nLTG Construction Co., as the general contractor. Both Phoenix-Griffin and LTG are owned by Lloyd T. Griffin. All\nare plaintiffs in the second litigation and appellees here. We refer to them collectively as Phoenix and to the\nsecond litigation as Phoenix-I.\nDuring the course of Phoenix's work, a substantial question arose as to whether Phoenix had paid the wage rates\nrequired by federal law. The United States Department of Labor (DOL) requested HUD to withhold $500,000 in\nfunds pending resolution of the question. When HUD announced its intention to withhold 00 or to direct PHA to\n97\nwithhold 00 $500,000 from the next payment due Phoenix, Phoenix sued both HUD and PHA. It sought injunctive\n97\nrelief, damages, and other remedies, asserting that husbanding the funds was arbitrary and capricious, violated\nspecific laws and regulations, abridged Phoenix's constitutional rights, and threatened Phoenix with irreparable\nharm. Among other things, Phoenix asserted that, without access to the $500,000, it would be prevented from\npaying down its revolving line of credit, thus causing its lead bank to close the spigot. Phoenix feared that it would\nbe unable to complete construction in progress if further advances were denied.\nA hearing on Phoenix's request for a preliminary injunction was held on June 6, 1991. The stated purpose of the\nhearing was to determine if HUD and/or PHA should be enjoined from withholding payments due to Phoenix\nunder existing contracts. At the hearing, the district judge suggested that HUD, which had directed the holdback,\nmight be in contempt of the 1989 Order. He asked HUD to brief the topic.\nFour days after HUD's brief was served, the court filed a memorandum decision under a dual caption referring to\n[2]\nboth the new and old cases. Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 768 F.Supp. 21 (D.R.I.1991).  The court stated that its\n\"clear intention at the time of the [1989 Order] was to bind HUD as well as the PHA.\" The court remarked that\nHUD had been an active participant in the litigation leading up to, and following, entry of the 1989 Order,\nincluding the earlier appeal. Characterizing HUD's decision to withhold $500,000 as the product of an interagency\nturf battle between HUD and DOL 00 a characterization which HUD emphatically contests 00 the court ruled that\n97 97\nHUD could, and should, have avoided flouting the 1989 Order by issuing a change order to make funds available\nto Phoenix, notwithstanding DOL's administrative directive. Hence, HUD could not assert that compliance with\nthe 1989 Order was an impossibility.\n15 *15 In the end, the court found that HUD was fully subject to the 1989 Order and had violated it. The court\nconcluded that, \"[u]ntil such time as HUD has done everything within its power to move the [replacement\nhousing] project toward completion\" as per the preexisting time schedule, the court would not find HUD to have\n\ncomplied with the outstanding order. 768 F.Supp. at 25 (emphasis in the original). The court gave HUD three\ndays within which to resume making payments in the ordinary course. If HUD failed to do so within the three-day\nperiod, thus purging itself of the contempt, then:\nIn order to coerce compliance with my order, I will initially fine the agency $250,000. I will continue\nto fine it at a rate of $2,000 a day until HUD removes all barriers to completion within its control.\nThe fine will be capped at $500,000 and any monies collected by this Court shall be applied\ntoward completion of the housing.\nId. at 25-26. Cognizant of the tightness of the schedule it had imposed, the district court stayed execution of its\norder for an additional ten days (until June 27, 1991). During that interval, this appeal was docketed. We granted\n[3]\nan appellate stay maintaining the status quo.\nII. ISSUES ON APPEAL\nThe government advances a host of reasons why the contempt finding cannot stand. It argues, inter alia, that the\n1989 Order was rendered nugatory by the stipulations entered into among the parties in the spring of 1991, see\nsupra p. 14; that the contractual claim underlying Phoenix's suit belonged in the Court of Claims, not the district\ncourt; that the district court erred in entering the contempt finding sua sponte; that the suggested change order\nvitiated applicable provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act; that the contempt citation intruded improperly\ninto the law enforcement functions of the Executive Branch; that the district court's assessment of a monetary\nsanction against HUD transgressed principles of sovereign immunity; and that the sanction imposed was unlawful\nsince it was compensatory rather than coercive. For our purposes, however, we need not go beyond the\ngovernment's main line of attack: its insistence that the 1989 Order did not comprise a clear and unequivocal\ncommand binding HUD to the performance of the duties envisioned at a later date by the district court. Because\nthis attack carries the day, we decline to pursue the appellant's other theories (and we express no opinion on any\n[4]\nof them).\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nWe turn first to the standard of review. Normally, we review a trial court's factfinding in contempt proceedings for\nclear error. See, e.g., Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206, 1218-19 (1st Cir.1991); Fortin v. Commissioner of\nMass. Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 692 F.2d 790, 794 (1st Cir. 1982). Mixed fact/law questions are, ordinarily, reviewed\nin the same way. Langton, 928 F.2d at 1219; Fortin, 692 F.2d at 794. Questions of law and mixed questions\nwhere the legal aspect predominates are afforded plenary review. See, e.g., Davies v. Grossmont Union High\nSchool Dist., 930 F.2d 1390, 1394 (9th Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2892, 115 L.Ed.2d 1057\n16 (1991); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 88-9 (MIA), 899 F.2d 1039, 1042 (11th Cir.1990). The trial court's ultimate \n*16 finding on contempt is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Massachusetts Ass'n of Older Americans v.\nCommissioner of Pub. Welfare, 803 F.2d 35, 38-39 (1st Cir.1986); General Signal Corp. v. Donallco, Inc., 787\nF.2d 1376, 1379 (9th Cir.1986); see also In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 906 F.2d 1485, 1488 (10th Cir.1990)\n(recapitulating applicable standards of review).\nWe have stated that the abuse-of-discretion standard will \"be administered flexibly, with due regard for the\ncircumstances.\" Langton, 928 F.2d at 1220; see also Massachusetts Ass'n of Older Americans, 803 F.2d at 38-39\n; AMF, Inc. v. Jewett, 711 F.2d 1096, 1101 (1st Cir.1983). One circumstance which must invariably be considered\nis the nature of the underlying case, it being accepted that greater deference is owed to the trial court in public\nlaw litigation than in purely private litigation. See, e.g., Massachusetts Ass'n of Older Americans, 803 F.2d at 38.\nBut the most important circumstance is often the overall nature of the finding from which the appeal has been\ntaken. Even in a public law case, our review will proceed more searchingly when, as here, we are confronted with\na finding of contempt than when we are called upon to consider a finding exonerating a putative contemnor from\na charged contempt. The contempt power is, after all, one of the most potent weapons in the judicial\narmamentarium. See International Longshoremen's Ass'n, Local 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Ass'n, 389\nU.S. 64, 76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 208, 19 L.Ed.2d 236 (1967).\n\nRecognizing the contempt power's virility and damage potential, courts have created a number of prudential\nprinciples designed to oversee its deployment. For one thing, in levying contempt sanctions, the court must\nexercise the least possible power suitable to achieve the end proposed. Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265,\n110 S.Ct. 625, 632, 635, 107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990); Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 371, 86 S.Ct. 1531,\n1536, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966). Second, \"a complainant must prove civil contempt by clear and convincing\nevidence.\" Langton, 928 F.2d at 1220. For another thing, civil contempt will lie only if the putative contemnor has\nviolated an order that is clear and unambiguous. See Local 1291, 389 U.S. at 76, 88 S.Ct. at 208; NBA\nProperties, Inc. v. Gold, 895 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir.1990); Drywall Tapers and Painters of Greater N.Y., Local 1974\nv. Local 530 of Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons Int'l Ass'n, 889 F.2d 389, 395 (2d Cir.1989),cert.\ndenied,___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 1478, 108 L.Ed.2d 615 (1990); Ferrell v. Pierce, 785 F.2d 1372, 1378 (7th\nCir.1986); Inmates of the Allegheny County Jail v. Wecht, 754 F.2d 120, 129 (3d Cir.1985); Reed v. Cleveland Bd.\nof Educ., 607 F.2d 749, 752 (6th Cir.1979). Related to this last requirement is the principle that any ambiguities or\nuncertainties in such a court order must be read in a light favorable to the person charged with contempt. NBA\nProperties, 895 F.2d at 32.\nThese principles reflect judicial awareness of the \"court's awesome civil and criminal contempt powers.\" Wecht,\n754 F.2d at 129. In line with this awareness, and mindful that a party cannot be held in contempt unless its\ncontumacity clearly and convincingly appears, we turn our attention to the contempt finding in the instant case.\nIV. ANALYSIS\nWe bifurcate our analysis, considering first whether, reading the 1989 Order objectively, HUD had fair notice that\nit was compelled, on penalty of contempt, to follow a particular course of conduct. Because we answer this\ninquiry in the negative, we proceed to consider whether the appellants, even though not directly constrained by\nthe 1989 Order, were bound to implement it because of their relationship with PHA.\nA. Forewarned Is Forearmed.\nThere are several legal principles that guide our efforts here. The most important of these, already adverted to,\n17 implicates the unflagging need for clarity. This principle was given its most authoritative *17 and oft-repeated form\nby the Supreme Court a quarter-century ago:\nThe judicial contempt power is a potent weapon. When it is founded upon a decree too vague to\nbe understood, it can be a deadly one. Congress responded to that danger by requiring that a\nfederal court frame its orders so that those who must obey them will know what the court intends\nto require and what it means to forbid.... The most fundamental postulates of our legal order forbid\nthe imposition of a penalty for disobeying a command that defies comprehension.\nLocal 1291, 389 U.S. at 76, 88 S.Ct. at 208.\nThis requirement of clarity derives from concepts of fairness and due process. And, because an order\ncommanding a person to act or refrain from acting is inherently coercive, the requirement of clarity mirrors the\nrequirement of the Civil Rules that \"[e]very order granting an injunction ... shall be specific in terms; [and] shall\ndescribe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to\nbe restrained; ....\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d).\nThe consequences that attend the violation of a court order are potentially dire. It follows, then, that courts must\nread court decrees to mean rather precisely what they say. Decrees must \"be specific;\" they must\n\"describe in reasonable detail\" just what \"acts\" they forbid. These specificity requirements are not\n\"mere[ly] technical\" but are \"designed to prevent uncertainty and confusion ... and to avoid\" basing\na \"contempt citation on a decree too vague to be understood.\" Also, we must read any\n\"ambiguities\" or \"omissions\" in such a court order as \"redound[ing] to the benefit of the person\ncharged with contempt.\"\n\nNBA Properties, 895 F.2d at 32 (citations omitted). In short, the contempt power ought not to be deployed against\na backdrop of uncertainty.\nA corollary of the requirement that orders enforceable through the contempt power be clear and unambiguous is\nthat those who would suffer penalties for disobedience must be aware not merely of an order's existence, but\nalso of the fact that the order is directed at them. This tenet has not been stated frequently. Withal, the relative\nrarity of articulation testifies more to the sheer obviousness of the principle, cf., e.g., M. de Cervantes, Don\nQuixote de la Mancha, Pt. III, bk. 10 (1615) (\"Forewarned, forearmed.\"), than to doubts about its legitimacy. We\nthink it is beyond serious question that, as a necessary prelude to a finding of contempt, the putative contemnor\nshould have reasonably definite advance notice that a court order applies to it. In Spallone, for instance, the\nCourt overturned a finding that city councilmen were in contempt, noting that the relevant provisions of the\nunderlying decree did not direct the councilmen to act; rather, those provisions \"were directed only to the city.\" \n110 S.Ct. at 633.\nA court order, then, must not only be specific about what is to be done or avoided, but can only compel action\nfrom those who have adequate notice that they are within the order's ambit. For a party to be held in contempt, it\nmust have violated a clear and unambiguous order that left no reasonable doubt as to what behavior was\nexpected and who was expected to behave in the indicated fashion. \"In determining specificity, the party enjoined\nmust be able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden.\" Drywall Tapers,\n889 F.2d at 395 (citation omitted); see also Reed, 607 F.2d at 752 (\"The notice of a judicial order upon violation of\nwhich a contempt finding may properly be based is such notice as would clearly tell a reasonable person what he\nis required to do or abstain from doing.\").\nWe believe that Spallone illustrates the point. Indeed, there was far more in the Spallone decree to inform the\ncouncilmen that they were being directed to act than there was in the 1989 Order to inform HUD of any\nconstraint. Much of the Spallone decree was explicitly addressed to a group that surely included the councilmen\n18 (the Spallone decree \"was directed not only to the city but to `its officers, agents, employees, successors and all \n*18 persons in active concert or participation with any of them....'\" Spallone, 110 S.Ct. at 633 (quoting decree)),\nyet the Court held that the council members were not in contempt of the decree because, among other reasons,\nthe parts of the decree that were violated were not directed at them. See id. at 632-33. In contrast, the 1989\nOrder was not explicitly aimed toward HUD. Rather, HUD was only mentioned parenthetically in what appears as\nan explanation of the funding source that PHA would tap. More was needed as a prelude to saddling HUD with\nthe pains and penalties of contempt. See, e.g., In re Baum, 606 F.2d 592, 593 (5th Cir.1979) (reversing finding of\ncontempt because, inter alia, the order in question \"was not addressed specifically\" to the putative contemnor); \nBerry v. Midtown Serv. Corp., 104 F.2d 107, 111 (2d Cir.) (\"Before a person should be subject to punishment for\nviolating a command of the court, the order should inform him in definite terms as to the duties thereby imposed\nupon him.\"), cert. granted, 308 U.S. 536, 60 S.Ct. 114, 84 L.Ed. 452, cert. dismissed, 308 U.S. 629, 60 S.Ct. 297,\n84 L.Ed. 525 (1939).\nTo be sure, the Secretary participated in an appeal of the 1989 Order, which arouses some suspicion that HUD\nmay have thought the order applied to it. HUD asserts, however, that it joined the fray because it believed that the\n1989 Order affected its general programmatic interests. Given the language of the 1989 Order, HUD's relation to\nPHA, and HUD's role in the funding of public housing, it is understandable that HUD would be interested in the\nappeal whether or not the order was directed at it. Moreover, the other side plainly did not believe the 1989 Order\napplied to HUD; at the time, BASIC protested HUD's standing to appeal on the very ground that the 1989 Order\ndid not direct HUD to do anything. See PB-II,907 F.2d at 1244 (\"BASIC says that HUD lacks standing to appeal\n[5]\nthe [1989 Order], for the order tells PHA, not HUD, what to do.\").  BASIC's assumption that HUD was not\ntargeted by the 1989 Order demonstrates the plausibility of HUD's stated belief to that effect. And as we have\nsaid, uncertainty about the scope and purport of an order should be resolved in favor of a putative contemnor.\nUnder the circumstances, HUD's role in PB-II cannot suffice either to clarify what is at best an ambiguous decree\nor to patch the hole in the lower court's contempt analysis.\nWe are also aware that HUD did not continue to litigate the 1989 Order, or seek a clarification of it, after PB-II\nwas decided. In the overall scheme of things, this omission proves very little. Although the failure to seek a\n\nclarification of an order can in some situations betoken complacency toward safeguarding one's own rights, the\nfailure here more likely reflected that (1) the wording of the 1989 Order gave HUD no warning that it would be\nsubject to duties and sanctions thereunder, and (2) settlement negotiations were ongoing. In any event, given the\nposture of the current appeal, we must afford HUD the benefit of this doubt.\nOf course, the district court, when it adjudged HUD in contempt in 1991, noted that its \"clear intention at the time\nof the order was to bind HUD as well as ... PHA.\" 768 F.Supp. at 24. But the court's intentions, unstated at the\ntime the 1989 Order was entered, cannot repair the shortcomings in the original order itself. The sanction of\ncontempt may not be based upon an order that, by its terms, seems to be directed exclusively at another party,\nand in the bargain, fails to meet the requirements of clarity and definition demanded by our cases. Judicial\nintentions notwithstanding, \"[p]ersons may not be placed at risk of contempt unless they have been given specific\nnotice of the norm to which they must pattern their conduct.\" Wecht, 754 F.2d at 129. Put bluntly, a court's\nintentions and its orders are two different things.\nTo sum up, the language of the 1989 Order, fairly read, did not tell HUD to do anything, much less to do what the\n19 district *19 court later sanctioned HUD for failing to do.[6] Since first principles counsel that no person shall be\npunished by contempt if he could not reasonably have known of the special standards with which the court\nexpected him to comply, and since the contempt adjudication considered here subjects HUD to penalties for\nfailing to perform according to standards that were not clearly ascertainable at the time, the adjudication, absent\nactive concert or participation, see infra Part IV(B), cannot stand.\nB. Active Concert or Participation.\nIn addition to requiring that injunctive decrees be specific, Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d) also provides that every injunction\nshall be binding upon not only the party enjoined but also upon \"those persons in active concert or participation\nwith [enjoined parties] who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.\" On appeal,\nPhoenix strives twice over to convince us that, even if the 1989 Order targeted PHA, not HUD, the \"active concert\nor participation\" stricture caught HUD in the order's toils. We are not persuaded.\n1. Party Status. Phoenix itself acknowledges that the contempt order was not directly predicated upon Rule 65\n(d)'s \"active concert or participation\" language. The court below mentioned this language, however, in observing,\naccurately, that even non-parties may be held in contempt for violating court orders. The court reasoned that if a \nnon-party could be bound by an order because the non-party was \"in active concert or participation\" with the\nparty to whom the order was addressed (the targeted party), surely another party could be so bound. 768 F.Supp.\nat 25. We agree with this generality, as far as it goes 00 but it does not take us very far. Absent advance notice\n97\nthat an injunction's commands would bind both a targeted party and a non-targeted party, party status, without\nmore, cannot subject the latter to the constraints of an injunctive decree addressed exclusively to the former. As\nthe Second Circuit observed, were we to \"adopt the principle that an express order to one party carries\nimplications of duties imposed upon the other, it would be difficult to set limits upon the doctrine.\" Berry, 104 F.2d\nat 111.\nThe district court's reasoning is not assisted by its reliance on G. & C. Merriam Co. v. Webster Dictionary Co.,\n639 F.2d 29 (1st Cir.1980). Merriam suggests that non-parties are generally not bound by court orders because\nthey have not had their day in court; in other words, they have not had a meaningful opportunity to challenge the\norders' validity. See id. at 37. We agree with the court below that this principle offers HUD no shelter, inasmuch\nas HUD not only was a party in PB-I but participated in PB-II (the original appellate challenge to the 1989 Order).\nIt is, however, a nonsequitur to say that HUD, because it was not protected by Merriam's day-in-court doctrine,\nwas therefore constrained by the 1989 Order. The fact remains that the 1989 Order was so amphibolous, and the\ndistrict court's subsequent interpretation so unpredictable, that HUD, prior to the proceedings in Phoenix-I, was\ndeprived of the fair notice necessary to alert a non-targeted party to the uses to which its day in court might be\nput. On this record, claiming that HUD was bound solely because it challenged the 1989 Order is like saying that\n20 someone should be *20 bound by an entire order, half of which is written in invisible ink, simply because he\nchallenged the half that was visible.\n\n2. Legal Identification. Phoenix also tries a parallel tack. Pouncing on various allusions that the district court\nmade in reference to concert and participation, Phoenix theorizes that HUD, without regard to its status as a\nparty, could nonetheless be held in contempt because the 1989 Order plainly applied to PHA, HUD was legally\nidentified with PHA, and the two acted together in developing replacement housing.\nIn addressing this asseveration, we do not write on a pristine page. \"The courts have interpreted the language\n[`active concert or participation with'] as requiring that a person either be `legally identified with' a party in the\ncase or `aid and abet' the party to violate the decree.\" NBA Properties, 895 F.2d at 33 (citations omitted). It is\ndifficult, if not impossible, to characterize HUD's conduct as aiding and abetting PHA in evading the dictates of\nthe 1989 Order 00 especially since no one suggests that PHA had any intention of dodging, or took any action\n97\ndesigned to dodge, its responsibilities under that order.\nThe appellees' better argument is that HUD was subject to the obligations imposed by the 1989 Order because it\nwas legally identified with PHA. The district court, Phoenix says, intended all along that HUD be so subject; and,\nmoreover, HUD's intimate involvement with PHA and with the litigation should have sufficed to put HUD on fair\nnotice that the court meant HUD to conform its conduct to the order. To develop the legal identification theme,\nPhoenix, relying principally on Merriam, asserts that HUD had the power to direct PHA to do things (specifically,\nto withhold funds), thereby creating the requisite con-substantiality and, therefore, binding HUD by the 1989\n[7]\nOrder through the mechanism of Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d).  We think that Phoenix both misconstrues Merriam's\nanalysis and misunderstands the relationship between HUD and PHA.\nThe Merriam court focused, first, upon the power the putative contemnor had to direct the targeted party in the\nproceedings in which the order was entered. In Merriam, it was shown that the putative contemnor enjoyed\nsubstantial control over the targeted party's \"decisionmaking with respect to its litigation position in the original\ninjunction proceeding.\" Merriam, 639 F.2d at 38. This power of direction was combined with other salient facts:\nthe putative contemnor had been a \"key employee\" of the targeted party (a closely-held corporation), id. at 37; he\n\"was the [second] most active person in the operation of the [targeted party],\" id.; and the activities for which the\nputative contemnor had been cited were virtually identical with those proscribed by the original injunction, id. at\n38. These convergent circumstances allowed the court to conclude that the putative contemnor was legally\nidentifiable with the targeted party.\nIn sharp contrast to Merriam, nothing even faintly analogous to this factual array can be found in the record\nbefore us. Although HUD and PHA may have cooperated in the development of litigation strategies in PB-I and \nPB-II, each had its own counsel 00 and there is no reason to believe that HUD directed or controlled PHA's course\n97\nin the original litigation. HUD and PHA are distinct entities, each representative of a separate sovereign and each\nwith its own mission. That these missions may occasionally coincide is not enough to erase their separateness.\nFurthermore, HUD's ability to direct PHA's disbursements is limited by a network of specific contractual and\nregulatory provisions. Limited powers of this kind, without more, are hardly the stuff of legal identification. For\n[8]\nthese reasons, Merriam is not apposite to the HUD/PHA relationship.\n21 *21 Whether seen as a matter of party status or of legal identification, then, the contempt order against HUD\ncannot be justified under the rubric of \"active concert or participation.\"\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe 1989 Order neither adequately informed HUD of what the district court subsequently said it intended nor\nclearly and unequivocally told HUD that it would have to fund construction of replacement housing regardless of\nany federal law, regulation, or contractual provision to the contrary. Thus, HUD's directive to withhold the disputed\n$500,000 payment was not an act of contempt. While we appreciate the urgency of the housing shortage that\nProvidence faces and recognize that the district court has labored valiantly to ameliorate that problem, the judicial\nremedy employed here was simply too much of a reach.\n[9]\nWe need go no further.  Where the rule of law prevails, courts must operate within the framework of\njurisprudence. Hence, litigants' and jurists' objectives, no matter how laudable, can be achieved only through and\n\nin conformity with established standards. At its core, this case exemplifies one of the most basic of these\nstandards: no one may be punished, under our system of justice, for failing to conform his conduct to rules that\nhe could not ascertain.\nThe contempt order is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for such further proceedings as\nmay be appropriate.\n[*] Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n[1] The contempt order is aimed at HUD, the Secretary being named as a defendant in his official capacity. Both\nHUD and the Secretary appeal. For convenience, we refer to the appellants, collectively, as HUD.\n[2] The memorandum deals exclusively with the question of contempt. The court below did not rule, and to this\ndate has never ruled, on Phoenix's motion for preliminary injunctive relief.\n[3] None of the parties question 00 and we are independently satisfied 00 that we have jurisdiction to hear and\n97 97\nconsider this appeal. While contempt orders are generally not immediately appealable, because they are\nordinarily not final, the exceptions to this precept are numerous. See Morales-Feliciano v. Parole Board, 887 F.2d\n1, 3 (1st Cir.1989),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 1511, 108 L.Ed.2d 646 (1990). Here, the district court's\ndecision to hold HUD in contempt has the quality of finality required for an order to be immediately appealable. \nSee id. at 3-4.\n[4] A multitude of other issues raised by the parties, including issues related to the policy implications of the\nlitigation below, the federal government's role in solving the persistent housing problems that plague Providence\nand other inner cities, and the applicability vel non of various federal regulations to Phoenix's work sites, lie well\noutside the encincture of this appeal. Consequently, while acknowledging their generic importance, we do not\naddress them here.\n[5] We elected to leave the issue of HUD's standing unresolved, because PHA's acknowledged standing was\nsufficient to allow the appeal to go forward. PB-II,907 F.2d at 1244.\n[6] Although supererogatory in view of the 1989 Order's failure to target HUD, we note that, even if the order\ncould reasonably be read to direct HUD to do something 00 and we doubt that it can 00 the order certainly does not\n97 97\ntell HUD, in the district court's later phrase, 768 F.Supp. at 25, to do \"everything within its power to move the\n[replacement housing] project toward completion.\" By the same token, the text of the 1989 Order most assuredly\ndoes not suggest that if DOL requires HUD to withhold funds on account of the general contractor's method of\noperation, HUD must then depart from its normal practice, override the terms of existing contracts and\nregulations, and execute a change order that would effectively circumvent the reservation of funds lawfully\nordered by a sister agency. See 29 C.F.R. § 5.9 (1990) (authorizing DOL orders to enforce prevailing wage-rate\nlaws); see also Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. §§ 276a to 276a-5 (1988). Yet, this is approximately the interpretation\ngiven the 1989 Order by the district court. Targeting problems aside, such an interpretation cannot withstand\nscrutiny.\n[7] It is unclear whether the district court actually subscribed to the thesis that HUD's ability to control PHA's\nfunding decisions rendered it legally identifiable with PHA. We assume, purely for argument's sake, that the court\nmay have so inferred.\n[8] We note that there is seemingly another problem with the appellees' \"legal identification\" approach. We doubt\nthat it can seriously be contended that HUD was the instrumentality through which PHA carried out contumacious\nacts. Inasmuch as the court below ruled specifically that PHA was not in contempt, it would seem that HUD, even\nif legally identified with PHA, was not thereby identified with a contemnor.\n[9] We take no position on whether Phoenix actually violated the Davis-Bacon Act or whether Davis-Bacon wage\nrates were legally required in the circumstances of this project.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
