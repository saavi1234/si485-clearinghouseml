    "summary": "<p>On June 25, 1985, the plaintiffs, several thousand black clients of low-income housing programs in the West Dallas Projects, brought this class action lawsuit against nine Dallas metropolitan suburbs, the Dallas Housing Authority (\"DHA\"), and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). The plaintiffs, represented by North Central Texas Legal Services, brought the action against the defendants for violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 3604.  The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and assigned to Judge Jerry Buchmeyer.</p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that the Dallas suburbs refused to participate in DHA's section 8 Existing Housing Program. The section 8 program was designed to desegregate the Dallas projects. Residents of the West Dallas Project were given vouchers or certificates that enabled them to find rental housing in various Dallas metropolitan areas for which they paid a portion of the rental value and DHA paid the remainder. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant suburbs refused to participate in the program entirely and DHA administered the voucher program in a racially discriminatory fashion when suburbs did participate, gathering all black families who received section 8 vouchers in the West Dallas projects while allowing white families who received section 8 vouchers to move to Dallas suburbs.</p><p>From 1985 through 1987, the Court dismissed all nine defendant suburbs from the case after they agreed to participate in the Section 8 program. After the suburb defendants were dismissed, only the plaintiffs, DHA, and HUD remained as parties. On November 5, 1986, those parties agreed to a consent decree, which was approved by the Court on January 20, 1987. </p><p><b>Consent Decree</b></p><p>The Consent Decree recognized that 1/3 of the 3,500 West Dallas Project housing units were vacant and unfit for human habitation due to lead contamination and deterioration. It further recognized that DHA had operated its program to enforce racial segregation and prevent black individuals from moving into predominately white areas. DHA agreed to develop a revitalization plan for the West Dallas projects and submit the plan to HUD. The Plan would modernize 900 units in the West Dallas project using $18,000,000 of federal funds and demolish the remaining 2,600 units over the following five-year period. In accordance with the demolition efforts, DHA would issue Section 8 certificates and vouchers to replace the demolished units. HUD approved of the plan and also agreed to provide 1,000 units of additional housing, through the construction of 100 new units, 450 certificates, and 450 vouchers. Though we don't have a copy of the consent decree, it seems a class was certified for the purpose of the decree, as the District Court begins referring the plaintiffs as a class.</p><p>By the end of July 1988, HUD reduced the subsidy it provided to DHA to maintain the vacant West Dallas project units scheduled for demolition by 60% without the court's approval. The Court ordered HUD pay $1.8 million to DHA to make up for that loss. HUD appealed the Court order, and on appeal, the Fifth Circuit ordered the Court give reasoning for its determination.</p><p>In August 1989, in response to the Fifth Circuit's remand, the District Court issued 3 different opinions, known as <i>Walker I</i>, <i>II</i>, and <i>III</i>. <i>Walker I</i> focused on DHA's violations of the consent decree. DHA was found to have violated the consent decree by:</p><p>(1) failing to implement the non-discriminatory tenant assignment & selection plan; </p><p>(2) failing to provide tenant mobility services;</p><p>(3) failing to implement the 120% Fair Market Rent Exception in order to reduce segregation; </p><p>(4) failing to hit its goal of having 15% of Section 8 units established in non-minority areas; </p><p>(5) failing to ensure Section 8 units met the Housing Qualified Standards; </p><p>(6) failing to select a site, begin construction, or begin occupancy of any new public housing. </p><p>Because of these failures, the Court ordered the appointment a special master to monitor the compliance of DHA, as well as the other parties. 734 F. Supp. 1231. </p><p><i>Walker II</i> focused on two laws that were passed in December 1987. The Frost Amendment was passed as part of the 1988 HUD Appropriations Act, and prohibited the use of HUD funds for the demolition of any of the three West Dallas Apartment complexes. The second statute was called the Anti-Demolition statute, which in effect required that DHA and HUD's Section 8 certificates remain available for at least fifteen years in order for demolition of existing project units to occur. The Statute also prohibited the use of Section 8 vouchers as replacement units. Both statutes delayed the demolition of the West Dallas housing units. The Court found the Frost amendment unconstitutional because it violated the separation of doctrine powers, as it was a deliberate attempt to interfere with the consent decree. However, the Court found the Anti-Demolition statute constitutional, and applying the law retroactively, ordered no housing that was replaced by Section 8 vouchers alone be demolished. 734 F. Supp. 1272. </p><p><i>Walker III</i> focused on the joinder of the city of Dallas as a defendant subject to the consent decree.  The Court joined the City based on several findings that demonstrated the City of Dallas was a cause of the racial segregation in Dallas public housing through its own activities and its indifference to DHA's actions. 734 F. Supp. 1289. </p><p>HUD appealed both the court-ordered $1.8 million and <i>Walker II</i>. On September 27, 1990, The Fifth Circuit (Circuit Judges Jerry E. Smith, Samuel D. Johnson, and Homer Thornberry) vacated the order that HUD pay $1.8 million to DHA, finding that the District Court had no authority under the Consent Decree to compel HUD's payment for demolition. The Fifth Circuit then reversed Walker II. The Appeals Court found the Frost Amendment constitutional because it did not outright ban the demolition of the West Dallas Project Housing, and merely removed federal funding for the purpose of the project's demolition. Finally, the Fifth Circuit reversed the Court's holding that the Anti-Demolition Statute applies retroactively. 912 F. 2d 819. </p><p>The Court appointed a special master, and the parties continued efforts to comply with the consent decree. In April 1991, Dallas was found in violation for failing to make payments to the special master in preparation for an equalization survey. On March 30, 1992, the Consent Decree was modified to include an obligation on the City of Dallas to oppose any proposals to deny federal funding for West Dallas Project demolition or replacement. (Docket #674). On the same day, the Court also granted in part a motion for emergency relief based on hazardous substances in West Dallas. The Court denied injunctive relief but requested DHA to not assign additional families to the West Dallas projects during the EPA's soil testing for environmental health issues-specifically lead poisoning. (Docket #677) Finally, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the 1987 consent decree between the plaintiffs and HUD, placing the parties back to their positions prior to the agreement (Docket #680). </p><p>At this point, the active parties were the plaintiffs, HUD, Dallas, and DHA. The plaintiffs maintained a consent decree with only DHA and the City of Dallas. During 1992, HUD developed a plan for West Dallas. The plaintiffs opposed the plan, arguing that it presented a variety of environmental issues.  In September 1992, the Court ordered that Dallas reimburse DHA for the cost of demolishing housing units in the West Dallas projects, Dallas would remain the primary source of funds related to development. </p><p>On January 12, 1993, the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of DHA and HUD's liability to the plaintiff class for injunctive relief, seemingly related to a variety of environmental claims related to the project housing. Parties then entered into a period of discovery that continued through May 1994. During this time, The Department of Justice was added as a defendant. The Court found DHA and HUD liable on May 27, 1994, and the Court ordered the Department of Justice respond to allegations of improper conduct. </p><p>The parties engaged in discovery and development plan creation throughout the next year. The Court approved three housing development proposals in the summer of 1995 (See Docket Entries #1213-29). In August, The Court also ordered payment of attorneys' fees for the plaintiffs' attorneys on August 9, 1995 of $910,228 related to their expenditures on monitoring the consent decree (see Docket #1232). Dallas appealed these payments. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Judges Patrick E. Higginbotham, Jerry E. Smith, Fortunato P. Benavides) affirmed and reversed in part, reducing the amount of fees awarded to plaintiffs as they related to the monitoring of the consent decree, but leaving litigation expenses unmodified. The expenses for monitoring were reduced to approximately $500,000.  99 F.3d 761.</p><p>Throughout 1996 and 1997, DHA and the City of Dallas continued to develop as required by the Consent Decree. On October 6, 1997, the Court ruled on the plaintiffs and DHA's motion for declaratory relief that the site and tenant selection portion of DHA's Section 8 program was constitutional. This action was brought against homeowner's associations who opposed the program and sought to enjoin the development of public housing near their neighborhoods. The homeowner's associations argued that the order violated equal protection because it specifically required development of project housing in white neighborhoods. The Court found it was constitutional because such race-conscious building was required to reduce segregation. 1997 WL 3317746. </p><p>The homeowners appealed. From 1997 through 1999, development in the neighborhoods at issue was stayed. On March 16, 1999, the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Judges Edith H. Jones, Jerry E. Smith, and District Judge John M. Shaw) reversed the District Court, finding that the remedial order violated the equal protection clause because it was not narrowly tailored. The Court then stayed construction of the sites relevant to the Court Order until the District Court modified its order. 169 F. 3d 973. On remand, the Court modified the remedial order to render it constitutional. As a result of the remand, the Homeowners sought attorneys' fees exceeding $250,000. The District Court denied the fees, finding that the Homeowners were not the prevailing parties and that it would be unjust to impose fees on the DHA. 2001 WL 1148109. The Fifth Circuit (Circuit Judges Emilio M. Garza, Edith B. Clement, and District Judge Harry L. Hudspeth) reversed this on November 19, 2002 and ordered payment to the homeowners for attorneys' fees. 313 F. 3d 246. </p><p>DHA's work continued on development and demolition in the areas not impacted by the above stay. On October 2, 1998, seven named plaintiffs reached an agreed judgment with DHA for damages of $25,000 for each plaintiff. Monitoring of consent decree compliance continued for several years, during which time, the DHA developed race-blind standards for selecting public housing locations.  </p><p><b>Settlements</b></p><p>On March 8, 2001, the Court approved a settlement between plaintiffs, HUD, and the Department of Justice. HUD agreed to provide 3,205 additional Section 8 vouchers to DHA, agreed to a pay up to 125% of the Fair Market Rent for each voucher, agreed to provide $4.8 million in mobility counseling to class members and $1.9 million for regional opportunity counseling funds, and $1,000 in administrative feeds for each of the 3,205 vouchers. In exchange, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against HUD. The remaining parties were the plaintiffs, DHA, and the City of Dallas.</p><p>On May 14, 2002, DHA moved for approval of a new public housing site. The Court granted approval on May 18, 2004, finding DHA satisfied their suitability criteria without using a race-based analysis. 326 F. Supp. 2d 780. Homeowner's associations appealed, and on March 4, 2005, the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Judges Patrick E. Higginbotham, Jerry E. Smith, Fortunato P. Benavides) affirmed. 402 F. 3d 532. </p><p>In September 2002, Plaintiffs sought to enjoin DHA from only providing public facility financial assistance for housing located in Dallas and expand its financial assistance beyond city limits. Plaintiffs identified that black families receiving Section 8 assistance were becoming more concentrated in several Dallas cities while white and Latinx families were becoming less concentrated in the same cities. The Court granted the requested injunction on March 18, 2004. In the same order, the Court denied joinder of the Attorney General to enjoin the Attorney General from denying DHA's application for bond issuance by a public facility corporation in a suburban area. 326 F. Supp. 2d 773.</p><p>Development continued under monitoring by the special master. On August 6, 2003, the plaintiffs and Dallas reached a settlement. Dallas was enjoined from unlawfully inhibiting the development of public housing. Dallas agreed to provide two officer squads to patrol the development sites without charge to the DHA, police neighborhood assistance, bi-monthly reports of criminal activity, provide $75,000 annually to DHA to provide as bonuses to landlords located in non-minority concentrated areas, provide $5,000 annually to DHA for the cost of monitoring marketing rent levels throughout the Dallas metropolitan area, and attorneys' fees of $175,000 to plaintiffs' counsel. Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the city with prejudice. The remaining parties were the plaintiffs and DHA.</p><p>On December 21, 2004, the plaintiffs reached an agreed final judgment with DHA. The plaintiffs agreed that the actions taken by DHA through December 21, the appointment of ICP as the Housing Fund Administer, and the following actions constituted all necessary actions DHA was required to take to eliminate racial segregation in DHA's public housing. DHA was required to:</p><p>(1) complete the remaining housing development;</p><p>(2) see that the 55 remaining settlement vouchers granted from the HUD settlement be used;</p><p>(3) continue to maintain the mobility counseling expenditure provided by the HUD settlement;</p><p>(4) complete the required audits for the settlement Voucher program for 2002 and 2003;</p><p>(5) maintain at least 119 Project-based Section 8 units for at least 15 years following the judgment;</p><p>(6) construct forty additional units, limit the West Dallas project site to 950 units;</p><p>(7) monitor criminal drug-related activity within the Section 8 apartment projects;</p><p>(8) provide monthly reports to the plaintiffs' counsel about Section 8 project activities until all of its obligations are completed;</p><p>(9) And provide an annual report to the court reporting its compliance with this final order.</p><p>The Court maintained jurisdiction to rule on issues of non-compliance and attorneys' fees. </p><p>Development continued for several years. In June 2007, the Plaintiffs and DHA reached another settlement on the implementation and budget for 1,000 vouchers received by DHA from HUD in 2006 (HUD had previously delivered 2,105 of the required vouchers). The settlement detailed that DHA was to continue using the funds provided by HUD to service the plaintiff class. DHA agreed to a 125% Fair Market Rent coverage, establishing outreach programs, post-move services, monthly and annual reporting, annual auditing, and annual surveys.</p><p>Over the next several years, DHA continued to work on completing its obligations pursuant to the consent decree and various settlements under supervision of the court and special master. In 2009, Judge Jerry Buchmeyer passed away and the case was transferred to Judge Reed C. O'Connor. DHA continued to provide status reports on its progress with the Consent Decree. In October 2013, the parties agreed to amend their settlement agreement in order to adjust locations of eligible housing because 946 voucher households were determined no longer eligible by the 2010 census. DHA agreed to notify all relevant participants that they would lose access to the Walker settlement vouchers unless they opted to move to a new eligible location. </p><p><b>Current Status</b></p><p>On April 17, 2014, the Court ordered DHA to recalculate and correct the Walker Settlement Voucher payment standard for all households based on several claims that the payments were incorrect. By December 13, 2016, DHA and the plaintiffs' counsel had agreed to the reimbursements calculated for voucher holders for which DHA paid the incorrect amount, the reimbursement totaled $512,187 and were distributed to 410 voucher holders. </p><p>The case remains open. DHA continues to work on complying with the consent decree and settlement agreements. The docket was last updated on February 2, 2018 with an amended status report filed by DHA.</p>",

JONES, Circuit Judge:\nThe Dallas Housing Authority (DHA), the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the\nCity of Dallas were found liable several years ago for unconstitutional racial discrimination and segregation within Dallas's\npublic housing programs. The primary issue on this appeal is the constitutionality of the provision of the district court's most\nrecent remedial order that directs newly constructed units of public housing to be located in \"predominantly white\" Dallas\nneighborhoods.\nSpecifically, this is an appeal from a final judgment in two actions that were consolidated for trial. In the first action, two\nhomeowners and their homeowners' associations (\"Homeowners\") sought declaratory and injunctive relief against DHA's\nconstruction of two new public housing projects adjacent to their neighborhoods.il! The Homeowners challenged the\nremedial order's provisions for new public housing construction and race-conscious site selection alleging that these were not\nnarrowly tailored to remedy the vestiges of past discrimination and segregation. In the second action, the original class\nplaintiffs, tenants in the public housing programs, sought declaratory relief that the remedial order provisions are\nconstitutional. The district court entered judgment against the Homeowners in the first action and for the class plaintiffs in\nthe second action. The Homeowners appealed. We essentially vacate and remand for further consideration by the district\ncourt.\nI. BACKGROUND\n2 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\nPart of the convoluted history of this case is concisely recounted in Walker v. HUD, 912 F.2d 819, 821-25 (5th Cir. 1990)\n[hereinafter Walker IV]. We will not repeat that history here, but some important procedural and substantive gaps in this\ncourt's prior opinion, which addressed different issues, should be filled in.\nThis case began in 1985 and initially resulted in a consent decree, which was approved by the district court in 1987. See\nWalker v. HUD, 734 F. Supp. 1231, 1247-82 (N.D. Tex. 1989) [hereinafter Walker 7] (reprinting the district court's 1987\nconsent decree and its \"Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law Approving the Proposed Consent Decree\"). The consent\ndecree addressed the plaintiff class's^) challenge under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 to the purposeful racial discrimination and segregation within DHA's public housing programs. The\ndefendants were DHA and HUD. The City of Dallas was joined as both a defendant to the lawsuit and a party to the consent\ndecree in 1989. See Walker v. HUD, 734 F. Supp. 1289 (N.D. Tex. 1989) [hereinafter Walker III]. The history of public\nhousing in Dallas is a sordid tale of overt and covert racial discrimination and segregation. See generally Walker III, 734 F.\nSupp. at 1293-1312 (recounting in detail the history of public housing in Dallas). Virtually all non-elderly public housing\nunitsiil were constructed in minority areas of Dallas.!^ No new public housing units were built between 1955 and 1989 at\nleast in part for fear that they might be located in white areas. Tenant selection and assignment procedures for public housing\nunits were crafted and administered to maintain racially segregated projects. DHA's Section 8 housing programs were\noperated to discourage blacks from moving into white areas of metropolitan Dallas. See id Blacks were purposefully\nsegregated for decades into either Section 8 housing in minority areas of Dallas or predominantly black housing projects in\nminority areas of Dallas.\nThe 1987 consent decree required the demolition of approximately 2,600 units of public housing in DHA's West Dallas\nproject, a public housing development located in a predominantly black area of the city and referred to by this court as \"one\nof Dallas's worst slums. \"M Walker IV, 912 F.2d at 821. These units were to be replaced on a one-for-one basis with\nadditional public housing units and Section 8 certificates and vouchers. See id at 822. The decree also required that one\nhundred newly constructed replacement units be built in a predominantly white area of Dallas, that a nondiscriminatory\ntenant selection and assignment plan be implemented, and that a Section 8 mobility plan be established to assist black\nfamilies joining the Section 8 program in finding housing in white areas of Dallas.d\nDHA repeatedly violated the 1987 consent decree. First, it resisted the construction of the 100 units of new public housing in\na predominantly white area. See Walker I, T5A F. Supp. at 1243-45. Site selection for and construction of the 100 units was\neventually completed, but only by court order. See id. Second, DHA violated the tenant selection and assignment and\nmobility provisions of the decree. See id. at 1235-42. DHA failed to establish and fund the required Section 8 mobility\nprogram, failed to timely obtain fair market exception rents,££) delayed implementing a nondiscriminatory tenant selection\nand assignment program, failed to include in Section 8 housing information a full list of all Section 8 units available in\nnon-minority areas, and failed to use all of the Section 8 certificates and vouchers allocated by HUD to DHA. See id.\nIn March 1992, the district court vacated the 1987 consent decree on the grounds that its terms were not implemented and\nthat the vestiges of purposeful segregation persisted. Subsequently, the district court granted the Walker plaintiffs'\nuncontested motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability. In September 1994, the district court held a trial on the\nissue of a remedy. The district court entered its remedial order affecting DHA in February 1995 and its remedial order\naffecting HUD in April 1996.\nThe remedial order affecting DHA requires DHA (1) to demolish at least 2,630 units of its West Dallas project, (2) to\ndevelop 2,807 replacement units for the demolished West Dallas units through both new construction and Section 8 vouchers\nand certificates,^ (3) to develop, either through construction or acquisition, an additional 3,205 new units of public housing\nin predominantly white areas of metropolitan Dallas in which the poverty rate does not exceed 13%, and (4) to develop all\nnew public housing units in predominantly white areas until there are as many units in predominantly white areas as there are\nin minority areas.^ A \"predominantly white area\" is defined as less than 37% Hispanic, black, or other minority. The\nrequired 3,205 new units may be satisfied by the use of Section 8 certificates or vouchers, but only after court approval.!!!)\nThe construction costs for 674 of the 2,807 new replacement units have been previously allocated to DHA by HUD,i!^l\nalthough only 75 of these units are currently under construction or completed.liii\nThe Homeowners filed this suit against DHA and HUD to enjoin the construction of two new 40-unit public housing projects\non sites adjacent to their neighborhoods.^ The Homeowners allege that the remedy of new construction is not narrowly\ntailored because it requires that the new units be constructed in predominantly white areas. The Homeowners do not contest\neither the remedial order's poverty site-selection criterion or HUD's site-selection standards set forth in 24 C.F.R. § 941.202.\nIn response to the Homeowners' action, the Walker plaintiffs sought declaratory relief that the remedial order was\nconstitutional. The Homeowners' request for an injunction and the Walker plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action were tried\ntogether in October 1996. The district court denied the Homeowners' injunctive relief and granted the Walker plaintiffs\ndeclaratory relief. The district court gave an oral opinion on August 25, 1997, entered final judgment on September 18, 1997,\nand issued its written opinion on October 6, 1997.LL>1\nII. STANDING\nAs an initial matter, DHA and HUD challenge the Homeowners' standing to bring their suit. The burden of establishing\nstanding rests with the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction {i.e., the Homeowners). See United States v. Hays, 115 S.\n3 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\nCt. 2431, 2435 (1995); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992). In a case that has proceeded to final\njudgment, the factual allegations supporting standing (if controverted) must be supported adequately by the evidence\nadduced at trial. See Hays, 115 S. Ct. at 2435; Lujan, 112 S. Ct. at 2137; Gladstone Realtors v. Village ofBellwood,  99 S. Ct.\n1601, 1616 n.31 (1979); see also Charles Alan Wright et al., 13A Federal Practice & Procedure § 3531.15, at 105 (1984)i!6)\nThe irreducible constitutional minimum of standing is composed of three elements:\nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact\"~an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and\nparticularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Second, there must be a causal connection\nbetween the injury and the conduct complained of.... Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the\ninjury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\nHays, 115 S. Ct. at 2435 (quoting Lujan, 112 S. Ct. at 2136) (internal citation and quotations omitted). In applying these\nconstitutional standing requirements, the Court has adopted a prudential principle that bars the adjudication of \"generalized\ngrievances\" against allegedly illegal government conduct.illl See id. In the equal protection context, this prudential principle\nmeans that standing exists only for those persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged discriminatory\nconduct. See id. (citing Allen v. Wright, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 3326 (1984)); see also Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans\nUnited for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 102 S. Ct. 752, 768 n.26 (1982) (rejecting the proposition that every citizen\nhas \"standing to challenge every affirmative-action program on the basis of a personal right to a government that does not\ndeny equal protection of the laws\").\nDHA and HUD principally contend that the Homeowners lack standing because they allege an injury that is conjectural and a\ngeneralized grievance. The essence of the Homeowners' complaint is twofold: (1) they have been purposefully discriminated\nagainst because of their race {i.e., they were intentionally singled out because of their race to accommodate two new public\nhousing projects adjacent to their neighborhoods), and (2) this decision has inflicted or threatens to inflict specific injury\nincluding decreased property values, increased crime and population density, environmental problems, and diminished\naesthetic values of the neighborhood because DHA will fail to operate and maintain the two projects properly. The remedial\norder's explicit racial classification alone is sufficient to confer standing on these particular homeowners. In Allen v. Wright,\n104 S. Ct. 3315 (1984), the Supreme Court wrote regarding the \"stigmatizing injury\" caused by racial discrimination that\n\"[t]here can be no doubt that this sort of non-economic injury is one of the most serious consequences of discriminatory\ngovernment action and is sufficient in some circumstances to support standing.\" Id. at 3326. The Court continued, \"Our cases\nmake clear, however, that such injury accords a basis for standing only to 'those persons who are personally denied equal\ntreatment' by the challenged discriminatory conduct. Id.; see also City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson, 109 S. Ct. 706, 721\n(1989) (\"To whatever racial group these citizens belong, their 'personal rights' to be treated with equal dignity and respect are\nimplicated by a rigid rule erecting race as the sole criterion in an aspect of public decisionmaking.\").\nUnder the remedial order, DHA selected the homeowners' neighborhood because they are white and they live in an area of\nDallas that is at least 63% white. The remedial order also requires that new units not be located in areas where the poverty\nrate exceeds 13%. Thus, these homeowners' \"whiteness\" is one of two controlling elements which identified the specific sites\nadjacent to their neighborhoods for new public housing construction. When a homeowner's neighborhood adjoins a proposed\npublic housing project whose site was determined by a race-conscious standard, he has standing to sue because of the explicit\nracial classification. Cf. Hays, 115 S. Ct. at 2436 (\"Where a plaintiff resides in a racially gerrymandered district, however, the\nplaintiff has been denied equal treatment because of the legislature's reliance on racial criteria, and therefore has standing to\nchallenge the legislature's action.\").\nDHA and HUD cite three cases to support their contention that the Homeowners' injury is a generalized grievance lacking\nthe specificity and particularity necessary to confer standing. Each case is easily distinguishable from the case at hand. In\nWorth v. Seldin, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 2208-09 (1975), the plaintiffs alleged that an adjacent town's zoning ordinances effectively\nexcluded low and moderate income persons from living in the town, but they could not demonstrate that the ordinances\nspecifically precluded them from living in the adjacent town. In Apache Bend Apartments v. United States, 515 F.2d 1174,\n1177 (5th Cir. 1993), the plaintiff-taxpayers were not seeking to litigate their own tax liability, but the tax liability of\ntaxpayers who were not before the court. And in United States v. Hays, 115 S. Ct. 2431, 2436 (1995), the plaintiffs were\ndenied standing to challenge a reapportionment plan because they did not live in the district that was the focus of their claim.\nIn contrast to these three cases, the Homeowners live in neighborhoods next door to the proposed new 40-unit housing\nprojects, and the location of these projects was selected specifically because of the homeowners' race.\nIn general, the racial classification of the homeowners is an injury in and of itself. See Shaw v. Reno, 113 S. Ct. 2816,2824\n(1993) (\"Classifications of citizens solely on the basis of race are by their very nature odious to a free people whose\ninstitutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. They threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership\nin a racial group and to incite racial hostility.\" (internal citations omitted)). But the Homeowners also allege that constructing\ntwo new 40-unit public housing projects adjacent to their neighborhoods will cause a decline in their property values and\nother problems involving crime, traffic and diminished aesthetic values. Relying on the district court's fact finding that the\nHomeowners have not suffered such an economic injury caused by the new public housing projects, HUD and DHA\nchallenge whether the Homeowners have in fact suffered a decrease in property values. Despite this finding, we cannot\nconclude, having reviewed the record, that the Homeowners did not put forth adequate evidence at trial to confer standing\nupon them. The district court did not hold that the Homeowners lack standing, as he was well aware of the potential for\n4 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\nneighborhood disruption traceable to improperly managed public housing projects. HUD and DHA cite no cases in which\nstanding has been denied to homeowners who asserted their quality of life and property values would be diminished by a\nnext-door public housing or other HUD project. The caselaw is to the contrary.!!?)\nIn sum, the Homeowners alleged and sufficiently proved facts that were adequate to support standing to sue.Oil\nThe injury they assert is not too abstract or conjectural. The line of causation\nbetween the alleged unconstitutional conduct and the injury is not attenuated. And\nthe prospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling\nis not speculative.\nIII. HOMEOWNERS1 EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIM\nThe district court held that the Homeowners failed to allege an equal protection\nviolation. The Homeowners challenge this conclusion.\nA. Lack of a Similarly Situated Group\nThe district court, citing Samaad v. City of Dallas, 940 F.2d 925 (5th Cir. 1991),\nfound that the Homeowners failed to show an equal protection violation because they\ndid not identify a similarly situated set of black persons who have been treated\nbetter. See id. at 941 n.31 This requirement, however, applies only to equal\nprotection claims involving facially neutral government actions, where it is\nnecessary to establish that the government is distinguishing or classifying persons\non the basis of race. See id. at 941. Explicit racial classifications, in contrast,\nestablish unequal treatment by their very nature. See Shaw v. Reno, 113 S. Ct. 2816,\n2824 (1993) (\"Laws that explicitly distinguish between individuals on racial grounds\nfall within the core of [the Equal Protection Clause's] prohibition.\"). Because the\nHomeowners challenge an explicit racial classification within the district court's\nremedial order, they have properly alleged an equal protection violation.\nThe district court also suggested that the Homeowners failed to demonstrate an equal\nprotection violation because \"[t]he impact [of the new construction], if any, on the\nHomeowners will be considerably less than [the] impact of the existing DHA public\nhousing projects on the property owners in the black neighborhoods with existing\nprojects.\" The district court's reasoning is incorrect: racial classifications are\nnot acceptable simply because they are perceived to have little impact. Any explicit\nracial classification, regardless of the burdens or benefits its- imposes, is suspect\nand subject to strict scrutiny. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 115 S. Ct.\n2097, 2113 (1995) (\"[A]ll racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal,\nstate, or local government actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict\nscrutiny.\"); Powers v. Ohio, 111 S. Ct. 1364, 1370 (1991) (\"It is axiomatic that\nracial classifications do not become legitimate on the assumption that all persons\nsuffer them in equal degree.\").\nB. Intent to Discriminate\nThe district court held that the Homeowners failed to prove an equal protection\nviolation because there is no intent to treat whites worse than similarly situated\nblacks. Once again, the district court is incorrect. An explicit racial\nclassification does not require any inquiry into \"intent\" in order to allege an\nequal protection violation. See Shaw, 113 S. Ct. at 2824 (\"No inquiry into\nlegislative purpose is necessary when the racial classification appears on the face\nof the statute.\"). \"Express racial classifications are immediately suspect because,\n1[a]bsent searching judicial inquiry . . ., there is simply no way of determining\nwhether classifications are 'benign' or 'remedial' and what classifications are in\nfact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial\npolitics.1\" Id. (quoting Richmond v. J.A. Croson, 109 S. Ct. 706, 721 (1989)).\nThe district court's skepticism of the Homeowners' right to pursue an equal\nprotection claim was unfounded, so we proceed to address the merits of their claim.\nIV. NARROW TAILORING\nThe primary issue on appeal is whether the remedial order's requirement that new\npublic housing units be built or acquired in \"predominantly white areas\" is narrowly\ntailored to remedy the vestiges of past discrimination and segregation within\nDallas's public housing programs. No party suggests on appeal that the racial\n5 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\nsteering, which for so many years was a part of Dallas's public housing programs,\nhas not been effectively eradicated. (20) Rather, the parties' dispute centers on the\ndistrict court's efforts to rectify the effects of the now-past discriminatory\npractices of DHA, HUD, and the City of Dallas. In short, is it constitutional in\nthis case to implement a race-conscious site selection criterion for newly built or\nacquired public housing?\nAny race-conscious remedial measure receives strict scrutiny under the Equal\nProtection Clause. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2113\n(1995); Black Fire Fighters Ass'n v. Dallas, 19 F.3d 992, 995 (5th Cir. 1994)\n[hereinafter BFFA]. This is true no matter which race is burdened or benefitted by\nthe racial classification in question. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2110-11 (citing\nCity of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 109 S. Ct. 706, 722  (1989)). Strict scrutiny\nrequires that a racial classification be (1) justified by a compelling government\ninterest and (2) narrowly tailored to further that interest. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct.\nat 2113. The Homeowners do not contest that there exists a compelling government\ninterest in this case. Therefore, our inquiry focuses on whether the remedial order\nis narrowly tailored.\nIn assessing whether a remedy is narrowly tailored, courts are to assess five\nfactors: (1) the necessity for relief, (2) the efficacy of alternative remedies,\n(3) the flexibility and duration of relief, (4) the relationship of the numerical\ngoals to the relevant market, and (5) the impact of the relief on the rights of\nthird parties. See United States v. Paradise, 107 S. Ct. 1053, 1066  (1987); BFFA, 19\nF.3d at 995. Before examining these factors, however, we must address the standard\nof review.\nWhen a district court's race-conscious remedial measure is challenged as not being\nnarrowly tailored, the party defending the remedial measure bears the burden of\nproducing evidence that the remedial measure is constitutional. See Wygant, 106 S.\nCt. at 1848-49; Aiken v. City of Memphis, 37 F.3d 1155, 1162 (6th Cir. 1994); see\nalso Raso v. Lago, 135 F.3d 11, 20 (1st Cir. 1998) (Stahl, J., dissenting). The\nparty challenging the remedial measure, of course, bears the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that the racial classification is unconstitutional. See id.\nIn general, we review a district court's legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. However, \"if the\ntrial court bases its findings upon a mistaken impression of applicable legal principles, the reviewing court is not bound by\nthe clearly erroneous standard.\"InwoodLabs.,  Inc. v. Ives Labs, Inc., 102 S. Ct. 2182, 2189 n.15 (1982); see also United\nStates v. Bentley-Smith, 2 F.3d 1368, 1373 (5th Cir. 1993).\nIn the case at hand, the district  court placed the burden of production, as well as\nthe ultimate burden of proof, on the Homeowners. Because he improperly placed the\nburden of production, we are not bound by the clearly erroneous  standard in\nreviewing his findings of fact. Nonetheless, although more rigorous  review may be in\norder, we will deferentially examine the district  court's  findings because  this is a\ncomplicated  case in which the district  court has a decade's worth of experience  with\nDallas's public housing programs.\nRace-conscious  remedies must be narrowly tailored to eliminate the effects of past\ndiscrimination as well as bar like discrimination in the future. See Paradise, 107\nS. Ct. at 1067-68; id. at 1073 (citing Louisiana  v. United  States,  85 S. Ct.  817,\n822  (1965)) . \"Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the\nmost exact  connection between justification and classification.\" Adarand,  115 S. Ct.\nat 2113 (quoting  Fullilove  v. Klutznick,  100 S. Ct. 2758,  2805  (1980)  (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting)). This means  that a race-conscious  remedy must be framed to address the\nexact  effects and harms of the discrimination at issue. See Wygant,  106 S. Ct. at\n1850.\nIn application,  arriving at an exact fit between harm and remedy  requires\nconsideration of whether a race-neutral or less restrictive  remedy could be used.\nSee Adarand,  115 S. Ct. at 2118; Wygant,  106 S. Ct. at 1850 n.6. This is because a\nrace-conscious  remedy should be the remedy of last resort. See Alexander v.  Estepp,\n95 F.3d 312, 316 (4th Cir. 1996) (\"[E]xplicit racial preferences, if available at\nall, must be only a  'last resort' option.\"). A \"race-conscious  remedy will not be\ndeemed narrowly  tailored until  less sweeping alternatives  particularly  race\nneutral  ones  have been considered and tried.\"  Williams  v. Babbitt,  115 F.3d 657,\n666  (9th Cir. 1997) .1111\nThe  first two Paradise  factors are the necessity for relief and efficacy of\n6 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\nalternative remedies. These weigh against race-conscious site selection for two\nreasons. First, Section 8 housing vouchers have not been given a fair try to prove\ntheir potential to desegregate. Second, other criteria than a racial standard will\nensure the desegregated construction or acquisition of any new public housing. See\ninfra, text at n.31.\nThe Homeowners argue that section 8 alone is capable of remedying the effects of\npast discrimination in Dallas's public housing programs, and they contend that\nsection 8 has not been given a fair try. They also point out, and the district court\nagrees, that Section 8 is more cost-efficient than new construction and is preferred\nby the majority of public housing program participants. Section 8 is more flexible\nthan fixed public housing because the participants may decide where and in what type\nfacility to reside. As a result, virtually all available Section 8 vouchers have\nbeen snapped up in Dallas.\nUnfortunately, however, numerous programs that would encourage and assist black\nfamilies to use section 8 in predominantly white areas had been in effect or fully\noperational for only a short time before trial on the Homeowners' case. For\ninstance, the record indicates that DHA's mobility program had been operating as\noriginally proposed by the Walker plaintiffs and the district court since only\napproximately 1994.1121 In addition, exceptions to the \"fair market rent\" caps on\nsection 8 vouchers and certificates have been slow in coming.-till It also appears\nthat potential section 8 landlords may now be paid \"signing bonuses\" for accepting\nsection 8 tenants. These are but three examples of numerous \"helping-hands\" that may\nbe employed to promote the success of section 8 as a desegregation tool.IHL While\nthe history and timing of their implementation by DHA and HUD in this case are not\nperfectly clear, it is evident from the record that they were not programs of\nlong-standing before trial. If section 8, combined with such assistance programs, is\nan effective desegregation tool, then section 8 is superior to a race-conscious\nremedy in that it allows market forces and personal preferences rather than racial\ncriteria to guide the homemaking decision.\nThe district court found, agreeing with the Walker plaintiffs, DHA, and HUD, that\nsection 8 needed to be combined with new construction or acquisition in\npredominantly white areas in order to remedy the effects of past discrimination.\nAdopting the Walker plaintiffs' proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in\ntoto, the court concluded that Section 8 alone was an inadequate remedy for several\nreasons: there are not enough Section 8 units in predominantly white areas; among\nthe available units there is a lack of three and four bedroom units; rents in\npredominantly white areas are too high to be covered even by Section 8's fair market\nexception rents; landlords do not want to participate in the Section 8 program; and\nSection 8 participants become frustrated in looking for housing in predominantly\nwhite areas and settle for housing in minority areas. The court also found that\nrental contract requirements in predominantly white areas contain provisions that\nare difficult for Section 8 families to meet (e.g., high security deposits,\nrequirement of having held a job for the past year, etc.). We neither accept nor\nattempt to reject these factual findings. Rather, there is one overarching factual\nfinding by the district court  which is uncontested by all parties  that\ntranscends the parties' objections to Section 8 as a remedial measure.\nIn 1987, when the district court first found DHA in violation of its original\nconsent decree, a negligible number of black families in DHA's Section 8 programs\nlived in predominantly white areas. 1151 In contrast, in September 1994,\napproximately 1,050 Section 8 black families lived in predominantly white areas.ilil\nAnd in the fall of 1996, there were approximately 1,335 Section 8 black families in\npredominantly white areas.1121 These numbers show that in the two year period\nbetween 1994 and 1996, the number of Section 8 black families living in\npredominantly white areas increased by 285, or 27%. And it was during this same time\nperiod that DHA's Section 8 mobility program was getting fully underway. The program\ncurrently in place, which the district court has not criticized, essentially became\nfully operational around 1994. Based on the relative success of DHA in moving blacks\ninto predominantly white areas via its Section 8 program between 1994 and 1996, the\nWalker plaintiffs, HUD, and DHA have produced insufficient evidence to show that the\ndistrict court's race-conscious site selection criterion is necessary to remedy the\neffects of past discrimination. Cf. In re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination\nEmployment Litig. , 20 F.3d 1525, 1545-47 (11th Cir. 1994); 1231 e also BFFA, 19\n se\nF.3d at 995 (\"The broad skip promotion remedy in the decree is difficult to justify\nwhen the knowledge to narrow it seems readily available.\"). Section 8, a\n7 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\nrace-neutral remedial measure, is increasingly successful at moving black families\ninto white areas, and the record indicates that it could be even more successful\nwith, for example, increased funding for both more vouchers and the mobility-\nprogram, llii more mobility counselors,IMi and higher fair market exception rents.llii\nWhen Section 8 has evidenced such promising results, options such as these should be\nexplored and tested before adopting a race-conscious remedy as a last resort.\nAdditionally, it is unnecessary to employ the race-conscious site selection\ncriterion ordered by the court even if new construction or acquisition of public\nhousing occurs. The district court may proceed with new construction as part of his\nremedial plan, but he may not do so using a race-conscious site selection criterion.\nOf course, other criteria may be employed to guide site selection for new\nconstruction. See United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 837 F.2d 1181, 1184,\n1236-37  (2d Cir. 1987) (using a geographical site selection criterion for public\nhousing). The district court has already mandated that all new sites be in areas\nwhere the poverty rate does not exceed 13%.IHI The district court's concern that if\nit does not attach a race-conscious site selection criterion to new construction,\nthen the new units will end up in minority areas and, as a consequence, Dallas's\npublic housing projects will almost all remain in minority areas, is unfounded. 1221\nIn deciding that Section 8 and nonracial site selection criteria should be\nimplemented before a racial standard, we are mindful of the \"respect owed a district\njudge's judgment that specified relief is essential to cure a violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\" Paradise, 107 S. Ct. at 1073. Nonetheless, a district court's\nbroad equitable powers remain constrained by the boundaries of narrow tailoring.(34)\nThe recent success of Section 8 and the availability of viable nonracial,\nnon-discriminatory site selection criteria, combined with the factors discussed in\nthe following paragraphs, demonstrate that the remedial order's race-conscious site\nselection criterion is not narrowly tailored.\nFirst, DHA, HUD, and the City of Dallas are all cooperating defendants. That is to\nsay, DHA, HUD, and the City of Dallas no longer discriminate against black families\nin DHA's public housing programs, and -- by all accounts in the record -- all three\ndefendants are active participants in crafting and implementing remedial measures to\neliminate the vestiges of past discrimination. In contrast, the Supreme Court\napproved a race-conscious remedy in United States v. Paradise in large part because\nearlier, less restrictive remedies had proven ineffective since the defendant\ncontinually resisted their implementation and stonewalled in developing acceptable\nprocedures for the advancement of black troopers within the Alabama Department of\nPublic Safety. See Paradise, 107 S. Ct. at 1062-63  (describing the Department's\ncontinuing failure to comply with the parties' consent decrees); id. at 1066, 1069;\nsee also BFFA, 19 F.3d at 996 (finding a race-conscious remedial measure\nunnecessary, in part, because the defendant was a willing party to the settlement of\nthe lawsuit). Where, as here, the defendants have begun making race-neutral, good\nfaith, and effective efforts to remedy the wrongs of the past, a race-conscious\nremedy should only be a last resort.\nSecond, the district court, in his 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, made references to the\nnecessity of a race-conscious site selection criterion because some participants in\nDHA's public housing programs do not want and should not be forced to use Section\n8.1251 While some may find it difficult to use Section 8, a race-conscious remedial\nmeasure is not justified by certain class members' objections to looking for housing\non their own versus their being offered a unit owned and operated by DHA. A\nrace-conscious remedy is justified, after race-neutral remedies have been considered\nand found wanting, if it is the only effective means by which to remedy the effects\nof past discrimination. It is by this standard alone that the district court must\nassess his remedial orders. As applied to the facts of this case, the district\ncourt's concern seems particularly irrelevant as only 474 new units in predominantly\nwhite areas are currently funded, and those units must be filled by Section 8\nfamilies who participate in DHA's Family Self-Sufficiency Program.llil That is, they\nwill be filled by the \"cream-of-the-crop\" from DHA's waiting lists. Thus, those who\nin all probability need public housing units the least (because they would be\nsuccessful Section 8 participants) will be directed to the new units, while those\nfor whom the district court expresses concern will be left with Section 8. DHA's\nrationale for filling the new units with participants in its self-sufficiency\nprogram is commendable, but it throws askew part of the district court's reasoning\nregarding the remedial need for new construction in addition to Section 8.\n8 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\nThird, it remains unclear why there is an absolute remedial necessity to build 474\nnew units of public housing using a racial classification when (1) 2,033 (or 72%) of\nthe remedial order's 2,807 replacement units will be Section 8 and (2) DHA and HUD\nmay submit a plan to use Section 8 for all of the 3,205 additional units of public\nhousing to be built in predominantly white areas. 1121 in sum, out of a total of\n6,012 units within the remedial order, only 474 (or 8%) must  assuming an\nacceptable Section 8 plan is submitted for the 3,205 additional units  be new\nconstruction in predominantly white areas. If Section 8 can effectively satisfy the\ndistrict court's remedial goal regarding 5,628 units, it is baffling to assume that\nit cannot do so for an additional 474 units.\nDHA, HUD, and the City of Dallas offer two responses to this criticism. First, they\nargue that 474 units is a tiny proportion of the overall number of units\ncontemplated by the remedial order; the deference due a district court in fashioning\na remedial order should protect such a small element of the overall remedial plan.\nThis would be correct if the 474 units were not attached to a racial classification\nwhich requires that they be built in predominantly white areas. Racial\nclassifications, even small ones, receive strict scrutiny. Second, they contend that\nif the 474 units already funded by HUD are not built in white areas, they will\neither not be built at all or will be built in minority areas which will only\nfurther the racial segregation of DHA's public housing projects. As discussed\npreviously, the district court may entertain any number of site selection criteria\nregarding new public housing units, except for race. No one suggests that the 474\nunits should not be built, only that requiring that they be built using a\nrace-conscious site selection criterion is not narrowly tailored.\nThe fourth Paradise factor, the relationship of numerical goals to the relevant\nmarkets, also cuts against the race-conscious site-selection criterion in the\nremedial order.Ilii The district court's remedial goal is to have half of the\nfamilies in DHA's public housing programs  (either public housing units or Section 8)\nin predominantly white areas of Dallas and half in \"minority areas\". The\njustification for this goal is that Dallas's population is approximately half white\nand half \"minority\" and, therefore, public housing should be divided accordingly.\nThis goal is overly broad. This suit was brought by black plaintiffs on behalf of a\nclass of black plaintiffs. There is no suggestion that the suit ever expanded to\ninclude all minorities or that any liability of the public agencies to other\nminorities could be found. The court's definition of a \"predominantly white\"\nneighborhood, with 63% white population, is also based on the idea that public\nhousing may not be placed in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of Hispanics.\nThere is no evidence in the record to support the court's arbitrary definition of a\npredominantly white neighborhood. The emphasis should instead be directed toward\nplacing public housing participants in neighborhoods of their choice through a\nvigorous Section 8 program, non-black neighborhoods, census tracts in which no\npublic housing currently exists, or non-poor neighborhoods.1111\nThe fifth Paradise factor is the impact of a racially-conscious site selection\ncriterion on the rights of third parties. Among all the groups affected by Dallas\npublic housing, only these Homeowners have maintained that they would be injured by\nthe racially-based site selection process that occurred here. Despite the court's\nhaving purportedly found against them on this issue, the totality of the remedial\norder is far more ambivalent. The district court ordered stringent criteria for the\ndesign and upkeep of the projects and for tenant selection here and in another\n\"predominantly white\" neighborhood  (the Frankford & Marsh site, fn. 12 supra), and\nhe called for the participation of neighboring community members, like these\nHomeowners, in planning the projects. The court showed considerable sensitivity to\nthe fact that public housing has in the past been disgracefully neglected in Dallas.\nThe resulting remedial order thus cuts both ways with respect to the Homeowners'\nrights. On one hand, it attempts to placate their fears of deterioration in their\nneighborhoods. On the other hand, it lends credibility to those fears.\nBecause there are promising, non-racially discriminatory ways to continue\ndesegregating public housing in Dallas, the provision of the court's remedial order\ncalling for the construction or acquisition of units of public housing in\n\"predominantly white\" areas is unconstitutional. Under the balance of the Paradise\nfactors, the criterion is not narrowly tailored, and it is premature to utilize such\na last-resort measure. We must vacate and remand this portion of the remedial order\nfor further consideration.\n9 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\nIn so doing, we emphasize several points. First, increased reliance on Section 8\ndemands that the public agencies implement a vigorous mobility plan that serves the\nrelocation needs and concerns of black families, reaches out to white landlords,\naffords adequate fair market rent exceptions, and combats illegal private\ndiscrimination. Second, this opinion does not deal with the remedial order's\nnondiscriminatory tenant selection and assignment provisions, which are not\nchallenged by the Homeowners. Third, this opinion does not preclude the construction\nor acquisition of additional public housing if sites are selected by means of\nnonracial criteria. But we also recognize that Section 8 is overwhelmingly preferred\nby public housing families, that it allows market forces and personal preferences to\ncontrol the homemaking decision, and that it has not proven ineffective at\ndesegregating Dallas' public housing programs when combined with a vigorous mobility\nprogram. As applied to the facts of this case, the district court erred in employing\na race-conscious remedy before utilizing race-neutral alternatives.\nV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court's remedial order is VACATED to the\nextent indicated and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings; the declaratory\njudgment awarded to the Walker plaintiffs is REVERSED; and this court's stay of\nconstruction at the sites adjacent to the Homeowners' subdivisions shall be ENFORCED\nuntil the district court holds additional hearings and enters a remedial order\nrevised in accordance with the foregoing opinion.\nRemedial order VACATED and REMANDED; declaratory judgment for Walker plaintiffs\nREVERSED; stay ENFORCED pending entry of revised remedial order.\n1.

Supp. at 1263.\nThe plaintiff class will be referred to throughout this opinion as the \"Walker plaintiffs.\" Deborah Walker is one of the named\nplaintiffs representing the class.\n4. \"Public housing units\" refer to housing units owned and operated by DHA. In contrast, under DHA's Section 8 certificate\nand voucher programs, participants rent housing units from private owners, and their rents are subsidized by DHA.\n5.

An additional 75 units are currently under construction or just completed in a predominantly white area\n(Frankford & Marsh project), and the units at issue in this lawsuit would add another 80 units to predominantly white areas\nof Dallas.\n6. The West Dallas project was completed in 1955 and contained 3,500 units. In many ways, it is at the heart of this\nlitigation. It was constructed to solve the \"Negro housing problem.\" See Walker 111, 734 F. Supp. at 1295. It is the second\nlargest public housing project in the United States. See id. at 1296 n.21. As of 1983, one-third of its units were so dilapidated\nas to be uninhabitable. See id. at 1307. In 1986, rejection rates for available units in the West Dallas project ranged from\n58-60%. See id. at 1308. At that time, there were 1,583 vacant units of which 1,300 had been boarded up for more than ten\nyears because of their deteriorated state. See id. The 1987 consent decree was designed to alter this concentration of public\nhousing by requiring the demolition of all but approximately 900 of the West Dallas units, the reconfiguration and\nrehabilitation of the remaining units, and the creation of new public housing opportunities in predominantly white areas of\nthe city and its suburbs.\n7. The Section 8 mobility program was designed to educate landlords about the Section 8 program and to assist Section 8\nparticipants in locating Section 8 housing in non-minority areas of Dallas. Specifically, the program was to include landlord\nrecruitment, exceptions to HUD's \"fair market value\" rent caps on Section 8 vouchers and certificates, Title VIII enforcement\nactions, and child care and transportation services. The program was also to provide neighborhood specific information on\ncrime rates, job training and employment opportunities, day care, medical facilities, neighborhood shopping, transportation,\nsocial services, objective indicators of schools quality such as TAAS test results, and \"environmental hazards or other\nconditions inimical to family life.\"\n8. The value of a section 8 voucher or certificate is capped by HUD at the \"fair market rent.\" This cap, however, can be\nincreased by special application to HUD.\n9. These 2,807 units have already been funded by HUD. The 2,807 units are made up of 774 new public housing units and\n10 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cvO.htm\n2,033 Section 8 certificates and vouchers. Specifically, the replacement units consist of (i) the 100 units constructed pursuant\nto court order from the 1987 consent decree, (ii) 1,335 Section 8 certificates and vouchers previously funded by HUD, (iii)\n339 new public housing units allocated to DHA in 1990 and 1991 as part of the proposed 2,000 unit West Dallas project, (iv)\n335 new public housing units allocated under HOPE VI in 1994 as replacement units for West Dallas, and (v) 698 additional\nSection 8 vouchers promised by HUD. Therefore, there are 674 new units of public housing currently funded but not under\nconstruction. Eighty of these units are specifically at issue in this case.\n10. The source of this final detail of the district court's remedial order is unclear. The written order itself is confusing.\nParagraph A.3 requires that all of the 3,205 new units be built in predominantly white areas.\nIn slight contrast, the district court reiterates throughout his oral and written opinions that all of the 674 new units of public\nhousing {i.e., the ones currently funded by HUD but not under construction) \"and any other allocated in the future, must be\ndeveloped in predominantly white areas until there are approximately as many non-elderly public housing units in those\nareas as in minority areas.\" 10/6/97 Written Opinion, at 22. The district court goes on to say, \"The race conscious site\nselection remedy is limited. It applies only until there is a comparable number of public housing units in white and minority\nareas.\" Id. at 22-23; see also 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, at 22 (\"Again, the 674 units must be placed in white non-minority areas\nuntil there are as many public housing units in white areas as in minority areas.\").\n11. To date, no plan for the use of Section 8 certificates or vouchers has been submitted to the district court. However, HUD\nstates in its brief\" to this court that it \"expects to meet this obligation by providing funding for Section 8 certificates and\nvouchers for al]_of the 3,205 units, at a rate of 320 units per year for 10 years. Thus, it is likely that the only public housing\nunits developed under the Remedial Orders will be the 774 units already allocated by HUD and designated as replacement\nunits under paragraph A.I of the HUD Remedial Order and paragraph A.2 of the DHA Remedial Order.\"\n12. The district court authorized that 200 of the replacement units may be used in the reconfiguration and revitalization of the\nWest Dallas project.\n13. The 75 units either under construction or completed are at DHA's Frankford & Marsh site.\n14. One site is at the intersection of McCallum and Meandering Way, and the other site is at the intersection of Hillcrest and\nHighway 190.\n15. These opinions will hereinafter be cited respectively as: 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, 9/18/97 Final Judgment, and 10/6/97\nWritten Opinion.\n16. \"If this were an appeal from a judgment granting the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing, we would be\nrequired to accept as true all of the material allegations of the complaint. However, because we are reviewing a final\njudgment based upon a fully developed record, we must evaluate standing from all materials of record.\" Pollard v. Cockrell,\n578 F.2d 1002, 1006 (5th Cir. 1978) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n17. A \"generalized grievance\" is a harm \"shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens.\" Warth v.\nSeldin, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 2205 (1975). \"The prudential principle barring adjudication of'generalized grievances' is closely\nrelated to the constitutional requirement of personal 'injury in fact,' and the policies underlying both are similar.\" Apache\nBend Apartments, Ltd. v. United States, 987 F.2d 1174, 1176 (5th Cir. 1993) (en bane).\n18. See Alschuler v. HUD, 686 F.2d 472, 476-77 (7th Cir. 1982); South East Lake View Neighbors v. HUD, 685 F.2d 1027,\n1034-35 (7th Cir. 1982); Society Hill Civic Ass'n v. Harris, 632 F.2d 1045, 1054 (3d Cir. 1980).\n19. As a subsidiary matter, DHA contends that the Homeowners lack standing because their alleged injury would not be\nredressed by the invalidation of the remedial order's requirement that public housing be built only in \"predominantly white\nareas.\" In other words, DHA argues that it could have selected the two sites in question even without the race-conscious site\nselection criterion.\nDHA applies the wrong legal standard. The test is whether DHA would have selected these two sites absent the\nrace-conscious criterion, not whether it couldhave  selected the sites. See Warth, 95 S. Ct. at 2208 (framing the standing\nquestion as whether, absent the challenged zoning ordinances that allegedly excluded low-income persons from living in the\ntown of Penfield, there was a substantial probability that the plaintiff would have been able to obtain such housing). There is\nno evidence in the record that DHA would have chosen the two sites in question absent the race-conscious criterion, and the\nWalker plaintiffs admit in their brief to this court that \"[t]he record is clear that DHA would not have chosen the sites absent\nthe court order.\"\nAdditionally, HUD argues that the Homeowners are challenging the wrong part of the remedial order by contesting the 3,205\nadditional units of public housing that must be built in predominantly white areas. It is quite clear from the record, however,\nthat the Homeowners have properly challenged the two 40-unit projects, which were selected on a race-conscious basis to be\nbuilt next to their neighborhoods. Obviously, these two projects are part of a larger remedial scheme that is affected by this\ncourt's opinion herein.\n20. See 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, at p.5 (\"From the very beginning the primary purpose that DHA had was to prevent blacks\nfrom moving into white areas of the city and the suburbs. That is not true of DHA today ....\").\n11 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\n21. It is true that in Hills v. Gautreaux, the Supreme Court did not disapprove a remedial order which, to end discrimination\nin public housing, required housing to be built in nonblack neighborhoods of Chicago. Hills, 425 U.S. 284, 296, 96 S.Ct.\n1538, 1546 (1976). But the Court did not consider the propriety of that remedy as opposed to a non-race conscious remedy\nlike a vigorous Section 8 program. The only disputed issue in that case was whether the remedy could extend beyond the city\nlimits of Chicago. Further, Hills predates significant changes that have occurred both in HUD's approach to public housing\nand in the scrutiny afforded race-conscious remedies. Hills does not mandate either the construction of new public housing or\nrace-conscious site selection. We must review the application of the Paradise factors, which the district court correctly\nunderstood to frame the issues here.\n22. See 10/30/96 Testimony of Ann Lott, Director of DHA's Section 8 Mobility Program (agreeing that most of the efforts to\nimprove DHA's mobility program have been within the preceding two years); 8/7/96 Deposition of Lott (explaining new\nprocedures within DHA's mobility program that were implemented in the prior year, including a marketing campaign for\nprospective landlords, a landlord newsletter, and private briefings for landlords on the section 8 program). But see 10/30/96\nTestimony of Lori Moon, President & CEO of DHA (stating that DHA's mobility efforts have been in effect since 1989).\n23. It is unclear from the record whether HUD has granted DHA a 120% fair market exception rent across-the-board for all\nsection 8 housing in predominantly white areas. It is also unclear whether DHA could be granted fair market rent exceptions\nhigher than 120%. Evidence in the record shows that a 160% fair market exception rent would significantly increase the\navailability of section 8 housing in predominantly white areas. Prior to implementing a race-conscious remedy, it would\nseem advisable to ensure (1) that rent exceptions above 120% are foreclosed, as they offer the potential to break-down a\nsignificant barrier to an even more effective section 8 program, or (2) that 120% fair market exception rents have been fully\nimplemented and tried, if that is the statutory maximum.\n24. Another example would be the vigorous enforcement of state and federal laws prohibiting racial discrimination by\nprivate section 8 landlords.\n25. The Walker plaintiffs state that in 1987 there were 66 Section 8 black families living in predominantly white areas, which\namounted to approximately 2.4% of all black families in DHA's Section 8 program.\n26. According to testimony in the record, this amounted to approximately 21% of all black families in DHA's Section 8\nprogram.\n27. According to testimony in the record, this amounted to approximately 24-25% of all black families in DHA's Section 8\nprogram.\n28. In In re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Employment Litigation, non-black employees of the Birmingham Fire\nRescue Service (BFRS) challenged a 1981 consent decree entered into by the City of Birmingham that required, inter alia,\nthat 50% of all promotions to the rank of BFRS lieutenant would be filled by qualified blacks (i.e., for every two promotions\nto lieutenant, one must be filled by a black candidate). See id\nThe 11th Circuit noted that between 1978 and 1981, BFRS significantly increased its\ntotal number of black employees from 8 to 42, which represented a shift in the black\npercentage of BFRS's workforce from 1.89% to 9.3%. See id. This was achieved without\nthe use of a race-conscious remedy. See id. The court stated that \"there is strong\nevidence in the record of this case that the City had implemented effective\nalternatives to race-based quotas to remedy its prior discriminatory behavior.\" Id.\n\"While the district court correctly concluded that, when the decree was entered, no\nblack had as yet become a fire lieutenant, we believe that, given the City's\nprogress at the entry-level, alternative measures designed to increase black\nrepresentation in the fire lieutenant ranks were feasible.\" Id. The court proceeded\nto list the non-race-based remedies that the plaintiffs proposed regarding promotion\nto BFRS lieutenant. See id. at 1546-47. It then concluded, \"Considering the efficacy\nof the alternative remedies, the relief provided in the decree cannot be reconciled\nwith the requirement that a government's use of race must be narrowly tailored.\" Id.\nat 1547.\n29. See 10/30/96 Testimony of Ann Lott, Director of DHA's Section 8 Mobility\nProgram, at 111-43  (stating that DHA is able to use virtually every Section 8\nvoucher or certificate funded by HUD); see id. at 111-65  (stating that DHA could put\nto use an additional 1,500 Section 8 vouchers).\n30. See id. at 111-67 (stating that the mobility program could use more counselors).\n31. See id. at 111-57 (stating that higher fair market exception rents would assist\nin obtaining more Section 8 housing in predominantly white areas).\n32. It is suggested in brief that this criterion essentially restricts the areas\navailable for new construction to predominantly white areas.\n12 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM\n\nhttp://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/97/97-11083-cv0.htm\n33. Moreover, the district court referred throughout his 8/25/97 Oral Opinion and\n10/6/97 Written Opinion to the danger of losing the funds already allocated to new\nconstruction because they could not be transferred to the Section 8 program. This\nmay be true. Nonetheless, it does not justify the use of a race-conscious site\nselection criterion.\n34. See Billish v. City of Chicago, 989 F.2d 890, 893 (7th Cir. 1993) (en bane);\nWessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790, 808 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Croson,  in particular,\nleaves no doubt that only solid evidence will justify allowing race-conscious\naction. .  .\");  id. (\"Our dissenting brother's valiant effort to read into Croson a\nbroad discretion for government entities purporting to ameliorate past\ndiscrimination strikes us as wishful thinking.\").\n35. See, e.g., 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, at p.28 (\"Even if this money  [for new public\nhousing construction] could be reprogrammed for Section 8, there would still be a\nneed for the use of public housing in the desegregation plan. Section 8, although\nthe preferred method, is not the only method. Indeed, there are members of this\nclass who made it evident, abundantly clear to this Court, that they did not trust\nSection 8, they would not use Section 9, and they should not be forced to use\nSection 8.\"); id. at p.33  (\"I recognized then, as I do now, that although Section 8\ncertificates and vouchers may be the preferred method for most people, for many\npeople there are risks in Section 8 that not all class members would want to take. I\ndeclined to force those risks upon unwilling class members.\").\n36. DHA's Family Self-Sufficiency Program is a voluntary program that requires\nparticipants to, for instance, be employed or attend school. The participants sign a\nfive-year contract with DHA in which they agree to abide by the program's\nregulations. In essence, the program is designed make its participants\nself-sufficient by providing them with \"upward mobility type assistance.\" 8/7/96\nDeposition of Lori Moon, President & CEO of DHA, at p.110.\n37. As noted previously, HUD states in its brief to this court that it intends to\nfulfill its entire obligation regarding the 3,205 additional units with Section 8\nvouchers or certificates.\n38. The third Paradise factor considers the flexibility and duration of relief. On\nbalance, that factor is neutral in this case.\n39. According to the Walker plaintiffs' brief, at 11: \"There are 113 county census\ntracts with 63% or greater non-Hispanic white population, 95 of which have a poverty\npopulation less than the county average. There are an additional 20 tracts with a\nnon-Hispanic white population between 50% and 63%. Only seven of these tracts have a\npoverty rate less than the county's. There are an additional 16 tracts with a\npoverty population below the county average but the non-Hispanic white population is\nless than 50%.\"\n13 of 13  3/17/99 10:06 AM",

 Dallas  City  Charter  expressly  provided  for  the  \n  \nCity’s  power  to  “provide  for  the  use  of  separate  blocks  for  residences,  places  of  abode,  places  of  public  amusement,  churches,  \nschools  and  places  of  assembly  by  members  of  white  and  colored  races.”  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  declared  such  \nordinances  unconstitutional  in  1917,  Buchanan  v.  Warley,  245  U.S.  60,  38  S.Ct.  16,  62  L.Ed.  149  (1917),  but  the  City  of  Dallas  \ncontinued   to   enforce   its   racially   restrictive   ordinances.   See   City   of   Dallas   v.   Liberty   Annex   Corp.,   19   S.W.2d   845  \n(Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas  1929);  Housing  Authority  of  the  City  of  Dallas  v.  Higginbotham,  143  S.W.2d  95  (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas  1943).  \nThis  ordinance—which  provided  separate  areas  of  residence  for  whites  and  minorities—was  finally  repealed  by  City  Charter  \namendment  in  1968.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  7  (Dallas  City  Charter—1952).  The  City  of  Dallas  admits  that  these  laws  \nestablished  “racially  segregated  housing  patterns  [that]  have  not  yet  fully  been  eradicated”—but  it  denies  that  there  is  “any  \ncurrent  policy  within  the  City  of  Dallas  to  provide  housing  on  a  racially  discriminatory  basis.”  \n  \n19   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  8  (1950–51  newspaper  articles);  Pls.  Exh.  9  (“Report  of  Joint  Committee  on  Negro  Housing”  of  the  \nDallas  Chamber  of  Commerce,  the  Dallas  Citizens  Council,  and  the  Dallas  Inter–Racial  Committee,  dated  May  24,  1950  and  \n  \nJanuary  24,  1951)  (“the  Joint  Report  on  Negro  Housing”);  Pls.  Exh.  10  (1962–66  documents,  p.  1).  \n  \n20   The  1950  Joint  Report  on  Negro  Housing,  p.  20,  also  noted  that  “Negro  School  students”  could  “by  special  arrangements”  use  the  \nDallas  Public  Library—and  it  recommended  that  “a  study  be  made  relative  to  adult  negroes  being  given  access  to  the  Dallas  Public  \n  \nLibrary  for  the  securing  of  books  they  desire.”  \n  \n21   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  44.  The  West  Dallas  project  is  the  second  largest  public  housing  project  of  any  type  in  the  United  \nStates.  \n  \n  \n22   At  this  time,  West  Dallas  was  not  even  in  the  Dallas  city  limits.  DHA’s  application  for  the  West  Dallas  project  gave  this  description:  \n   “The  area  selected  is  in  what  is  known  as  ‘West  Dallas,’  a  sprawling  slum  community  of  approximately  \n   20  \n  \n\nWalker  v.  U.S.  Dept.  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  734  F.Supp.  1289  (1989)     \n  \n  \nfive  square  miles  ...  West  Dallas  is  the  largest  concentration  of  substandard  dwellings  and  slum  \nconditions  in  and  around  Dallas  ...”  \n  \n23   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  5  (1950’s  documents,  Oct.  1955  Application,  pp.  17,  22)  (also  noting  “the  general  restlessness,  \nmobility  and  instability  of  many  of  the  white  and  latin-­‐American  families  comprising  the  segment  of  the  low-­‐rent  market  who  \n  \nhave  been  willing  to  move  to  ‘West  Dallas’  ”).  \n  \n24   Except  for  projects  for  the  elderly.  Dec.  12,  1986  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  1.  \n  \n  \n25   The  anticipated  completion  date  for  the  100  units  of  new  public  housing  being  constructed  at  Country  Creek  under  the  Consent  \nDecree.  See  this  Court’s  opinion  in  Walker  I.  \n  \n  \n26   Despite  the  fact  that  de  jure  racial  segregation  in  public  housing  was  declared  unconstitutional  in  1955.  Detroit  Housing  \nCommissioners  v.  Lewis,  226  F.2d  180,  183–184  (6th  Cir.1955).  \n  \n  \n27   Before  this,  HUD  had  accepted  segregated  public  housing  under  a  “separate  but  equal  policy.”  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  25  \n(Hearing  Before  The  U.S.  Commission  on  Civil  Rights,  June  1959).  Heyward  v.  PHA,  238  F.2d  689,  697  (5th  Cir.1956);  Cohen  v.  PHA,  \n  \n257  F.2d  73,  74  at  fn.  5  (5th  Cir.1958).  \n  \n28   This  1956  plan  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  Dallas  Citizens  Council,  a  civic  organization  that  had  supported  racial  \nsegregation  in  public  housing.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  10  (1962–1966  documents);  Pls.  Exh.  9  (1950  Joint  Report  on  \n  \nNegro  Housing).  \n  \n29   The  all-­‐Hispanic  Elmer  Scott  Place  had  a  similar  transition;  it  had  become  21%  black  by  1968,  57%  black  by  1970,  and  85%  black  \nby  1975.  \n  \n  \n30   Under  these  HUD  requirements,  offers  were  to  “be  made  first  in  [projects]  having  the  most  vacancies”—and,  after  an  applicant  \nhad  rejected  three  offers  of  vacancies,  “he  is  subject  to  being  dropped  to  the  bottom  of  the  [waiting]  list.”  \n  \n  \n31   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  13  (1968  documents,  pp.  27,  34,  66)  (Oct.  12,  1968  from  Justice  Department  to  DHA  attorney).  \n  \n  \n32   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  2  (Report  of  the  Task  Force  on  Public  Housing,  Jan.  1983,  pp.  22–23).  \n  \n  \n33   George  Loving  was  55%  black  in  1968,  72%  in  1969,  87%  in  1970,  and  91%  in  1971.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  31.  \n  \n  \n34   In  1974,  Cedar  Springs  was  7.5%  black  and  Little  Mexico  was  4%  black.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing,  Pls.  Exh.  31.  \n  \n  \n35   Similarly,  Elmer  Scott  would  be  85%  black  in  1975  and  94%  black  by  Oct.  1988.  \n  \n  \n36   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  92  (Darnall/Bacon  documents,  pp.  7,  5,  10–11).  Darnall  served  as  Acting  Executive  Director  from  \nNov.  26,  1974  to  July  1,  1975,  when  he  was  employed  by  DHA  as  its  Executive  Director.  The  Assistant  City  Attorney  acted  as  \n  \nDHA’s  lawyer  for  about  eight  months  (from  Oct.  1984  to  July  1985).  \n  \n37   Darnall  had  prepared  the  DHA’s  application  for  West  Dallas  rehabilitation  funds  before  he  became  Acting  Executive  Director  for  \nDHA.  He  knew  that  one  conditions  for  receiving  these  funds  was  to  adopt  a  legal  tenant  assignment  plan.  However,  the  Darnall  \n  \nplans  were,  in  effect,  rejected  by  HUD  in  1980.  \n  \n38   See  this  Court’s  opinion  in  Walker  I.  \n  \n  \n39   Overcrowding  is  the  “adverse  impact”  upon  the  schools  if  a  low-­‐income  housing  project  is  placed  in  a  non-­‐minority  area;  but  \nunder-­‐utilization  of  the  schools  is  the  “adverse  impact”  if  units  are  demolished  at  an  all-­‐black  project.  Compare  the  opposition  to  \n  \nTown  Park  with  the  inconsistent  opposition  to  Country  Creek  and  the  demolition  of  units  at  West  Dallas.  DHA  First  Annual  Report  \n   21  \n  \n\nWalker  v.  U.S.  Dept.  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  734  F.Supp.  1289  (1989)     \n  \n  \n(Jan.  20,  1988),  pp.  54–55;  Sept.  18,  1987  Hearing:  Testimony  of  Jack  Herrington;  presentation  by  Sidney  Stahl,  attorney  for  the  \nOak  Cliff  Chamber  of  Commerce.  \n  \n40   Compare  the  Town  Park  opposition  (Pls.  Exh.  14)  to  the  opposition  that  DHA  met  in  connection  with  the  Washington  Place  units  \nand  with  the  selection  of  the  Country  Creek  site.  Sept.  18,  1987  Hearing:  Testimony  of  Jack  Herrington.  And  see  this  Court’s  \n  \nopinion  in  Walker  I.  \n  \n41   That  is,  both  the  “white”  elderly  projects  of  DHA  and  the  public  housing  assistance  which  low-­‐income  whites  have  been  furnished  \nby  HUD  outside  of  the  DHA  programs.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Testimony  of  Craig  Gardner;  Pls.  Exh.  35;  Pls.  Exh.  36;  Pls.  Exh.  39  \n  \n(summary  of  location  and  occupancy  characteristics  of  HUD-­‐assisted  projects  in  Dallas  County).  \n  \n42   These  are  intended  merely  as  rhetorical  questions,  not  as  a  sermon.  But  in  any  event,  they  are  certainly  not  findings  of  fact,  and  \nthey  do  not  form  the  basis  for  any  finding  of  fact  or  conclusion  of  law  in  this  opinion.  \n  \n  \n43   Sept.  18,  1987  Hearing:  Testimony  of  Jack  Herrington;  Rulings  of  the  Court,  pp.  1–4.  One  of  the  sites  rejected  for  these  106  units,  \nbecause  of  neighborhood  opposition  and  political  pressure,  was  Country  Creek—which  DHA,  at  the  Court’s  direction,  selected  in  \n  \nSept.  1987  for  the  100  new  LRHP  units  required  by  the  Consent  Decree  in  this  case.  See  the  Walker  I  opinion.  \n  \n44   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  42  (16  unit  documents,  pp.  15–25).  However,  Assistant  City  Manager  Harry  Jones  candidly  \ntestified  that  placing  these  106  units  at  Cedar  Springs  would  not  have  served  “the  goal  of  increasing  housing  opportunities  for  \n  \nminorities  outside  of  areas  of  low  income  and  minority  concentrations.”  Pls.  Exh.  66  (Jones  deposition,  pp.  11–12).  \n  \n45   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  67  (Harold  Wasson  deposition,  pp.  19–20,  24–25);  Pls.  Exh.  66  (Harry  Jones  deposition,  pp.  \n33–37);  Pls.  Exh.  58  (City  reports  of  actions  to  further  fair  housing).  Assistant  City  Manager  Harry  Jones  did  testify  that  HUD  has  \n  \nconducted  an  annual  audit  of  the  City’s  “fair  housing  program.”  However,  effective  Sept.  1988,  a  HUD  regulation  sets  standards  \nfor  determining  whether  a  CDBG  recipient  has  complied  with  the  duty  to  “affirmatively  further  fair  housing”;  under  this  \nregulation,  the  City  will  be  required  to  conduct  its  own  analysis  of  its  CDBG  programs.  \n  \n46   This  opinion  is  not  intended  to  reflect  in  any  way  upon  Assistant  City  Manager  Harry  Jones—who  is  obviously  a  very  dedicated,  \nextremely  competent,  and  very  concerned  City  employee;  if  Mr.  Jones  had  been  given  adequate  resources  by  the  City,  he  would  \n  \nhave  corrected  many  of  the  problems  that  existed  with  the  inspection  and  “fair  housing”  programs.  Harry  Jones  is  also  very  \ncredible  and,  at  times,  painfully  honest.  See,  e.g.,  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing,  Tr.  110,  121.  See  also  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Testimony  \nof  Harry  Jones,  Tr.  33,  45,  104–106,  109);  Pls.  Exh.  67  (Harold  Wasson  deposition,  pp.  9–10,  17,  24–25);  Pls.  Exh.  66  (Harry  Jones  \ndeposition,  p.  33).  \n  \n47   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  67  (Harold  Wasson  deposition,  pp.  21–23);  Pls.  Exh.  85  (City  of  Dallas  Fair  Housing  Ordinance);  \nPls.  Exh.  93  (City  memo  on  “substantially  equivalent  status”).  Assistant  City  Manager  Harry  Jones  did  testify  that  the  City  planned  \n  \nto  seek  “substantially  equivalent  status,”  probably  in  1989.  Testimony  of  Harry  Jones,  Tr.  33–34.  \n  \n48   See,  e.g.,  the  City’s  refusal  to  permit  DHA  to  use  CDBG  funds  for  the  housing  mobility  and  relocation  benefits  provided  in  the  \nConsent  Decree  in  this  case—but  promising  the  use  of  CDBG  funds  for  street  and  gutter  improvements  so  §  8  Modern  Rehab  \n  \nfunds  could  be  obtained  in  1980  for  the  all-­‐black  Robin  Square  Apartments  near  Fair  Park.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  40  \n(Robin  Square  documents,  pp.  52–53).  \n  \n49   The  §  8  Moderate  Rehab  Program  of  DHA  and  the  City  resulted  in  a  90.6%  black  occupancy  rate,  with  projects  located  only  in  \nminority  and  low-­‐income  impacted  areas.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  37;  Pls.  Exh.  40.  \n  \n  \n50   Banks,  et  al.  v.  Robin  Square  Apartments,  CA  3–87–1713–R  (N.D.Tex.).  \n  \n  \n51   Plaintiffs’  Statement  of  Evidence  in  Support  of  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction,  p.  14  (Banks,  CA  3–87–1713–R).  The  choice  of  \nRobin  Square  is  certainly  not  explained  by  Herrington’s  statements  that  he  or  City  employees  thought  Robin  Square  “might  \n  \nimprove  that  section  of  the  community”  (Pls.  Exh.  40,  p.  11)  because  that  is  directly  contrary  to  DHA’s  certifications  to  HUD  (Pls.  \nExh.  40,  p.  20)  and  to  the  facts  about  the  condition  of  Robin  Square  (see  Pls.  Exh.  40,  pp.  84–86,  101–105,  109–110,  128–133).  \n  \n52   Statement  of  Elbert  T.  Winn,  Pls.  Exh.  6  to  the  Plaintiffs’  Statement  of  Evidence  in  Support  of  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction,  \nfiled  May  23,  1988  in  Banks,  CA  3–87–1713–R.  The  statements  just  quoted  were  not  denied  in  the  Herrington  Affidavit  filed  in  \n  \n   22  \n  \n\nWalker  v.  U.S.  Dept.  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  734  F.Supp.  1289  (1989)     \n  \n  \nBanks  on  June  14,  1988.  \n  \n53   In  connection  with  the  entry  of  the  agreed  injunction  in  Banks,  one  of  the  participants  made  this  comment:  “If  a  tornado  were  to  \nhit  the  Robin  Square  Apartments,  it  would  do  over  $5.5  million  in  improvements.”  \n  \n  \n54   Jan.  2,  1987  letter  to  the  Court  by  Dallas  City  Council  Members  Al  Lipscomb  and  Diane  Ragsdale.  \n  \n  \n55   Without  the  $31  million  that  was  forfeited  from  1969  through  1974,  “DHA  management  attempted  to  preserve  financial  \nsoundness  at  the  expense  of  physical  maintenance.  The  physical  condition  of  DHA  properties  [such  as  West  Dallas]  deteriorated  \n  \nrapidly  and  most  projects  have  never  been  returned  to  the  condition  they  were  in  before  ...”  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  2,  \npp.  22–23.  See  part  6  above,  “Assignments  of  Tenants  by  Race  (1965–74):  The  Loss  By  DHA  of  over  $31  million.”  \n  \n56   Because  of  this  policy  of  deliberate  segregation,  West  Dallas  was  over  95%  black  in  1975.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  31.  \n  \n  \n57   HUD  expressed  concern  about  the  high  vacancy  level  at  West  Dallas  as  early  as  1963.  DHA  responded  by  claiming  that  it  was  \nconsidering  modernization  of  the  project,  providing  day  care,  and  “creating  small  community  areas  within  each  project”  to  \n  \ndevelop  tenant  pride  in  these  areas.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  10,  pp.  5–8.  \n  \n58   Findings  of  Fact  and  Conclusions  of  Law  Approving  the  Consent  Decree,  pp.  9–13  (filed  Jan.  20,  1987).  \n  \n  \n59   A  1980  survey  funded  by  the  City  of  Dallas  estimated  that  it  would  cost  $47.8  million  for  the  complete  rehabilitation  of  West  \nDallas.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  46,  (Millkey  &  Brown  Study  of  West  Dallas  Project,  pp.  20,  39,  59).  \n  \n  \n60   The  plan  would  have  reduced  the  number  of  low-­‐income  units  at  West  Dallas  from  3,500  to  between  1,400  and  2,000.  Dec.  12,  \n1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  49  (Lake  West  Master  Plan,  pp.  78–86).  \n  \n  \n61   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  50  (West  Dallas  modernization  documents).  Under  the  HUD  “viability”  requirement,  DHA  would  \nhave  to  show  that  both  it  and  the  City  of  Dallas  would  improve  the  community  by  correcting  the  crime  problem,  the  physical  \n  \ndeterioration  of  the  neighborhood,  and  the  concentration  of  federally-­‐assisted  housing  in  the  area.  Pls.  Exh.  50,  pp.  7–10.  \n  \n62   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  51,  p.  2;  Pls.  Exh.  52  (DHA  summary  of  West  Dallas  rejection  rates).  On  March  25,  1988,  DHA  \nbegan  offering  West  Dallas  units  to  new  applicnts  on  a  voluntary  basis;  however,  from  that  date  until  Oct.  31,  1988,  only  21  \n  \npersons  out  of  1000  applicants  (2.1%)  chose  to  move  into  West  Dallas.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exhs.  55–56.  \n  \n63   March  25,  1988  Hearing:  Testimony  of  Jack  Herrington  (Mayor  Taylor  participated  in  the  settlement  negotiations,  and  his  support  \nwas  an  important  factor  in  concluding  the  settlement).  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing,  Testimony  of  Assistant  City  Manager  Harry  Jones  \n  \n(Jones,  the  Mayor  and  two  city  attorneys  participated  in  the  negotiations),  Tr.  32;  Pls.  Exh.  60,  Mayor’s  letter  of  Nov.  5,  1986  to  \nDHA  Executive  Director  Herrington.  \n  \n64   “The  parties  enter  into  this  Decree  on  the  explicit  premise  that  the  resources  currently  available  to  DHA  to  implement  the  Decree  \nare  inadequate.  In  order  to  implement  the  Decree,  substantial  resources  will  have  to  be  made  available  from  institutions  and  \n  \norganizations  other  than  DHA.”  Consent  Decree,  p.  2.  \n  \n65   Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  Exh.  30  (“Final  Report/Feasibility  Research  for

 stated:  “Nov.  5,  1987:  Executive  Director  attends  meeting  \nin  Mayor  Strauss’  office  with  the  Mayor,  Councilpersons,  HUD  representatives  and  those  opposing  the  settlement.  No  decision  \n  \nresults,  but  the  position  of  HUD  and  DHA  were  made  clear  regarding  a  firm  commitment  to  accomplish  Decree  objectives.”  DHA  \nFirst  Annual  Report,  p.  60  (Jan.  20,  1988).  \n  \n67   Some  groups  objected  to  the  West  Dallas  demolition—but  not  to  any  other  part  of  the  Consent  Decree—for  obviously  political  \nreasons,  such  as  the  loss  of  votes  or  a  power  base  if  blacks  were  moved  out  of  West  Dallas.  Other  groups  sincerely  objected  to  \n  \nthe  demolition  of  any  public  housing.  Still  others  were  sincere  in  wanting  the  West  Dallas  demolition  delayed,  to  see  “if  there  \nwere  any  alternative  solutions.”  But  some  groups  objected  to  the  attempted  desegregation  of  public  housing  in  Dallas;  they  \n   23  \n  \n\nWalker  v.  U.S.  Dept.  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  734  F.Supp.  1289  (1989)     \n  \n  \nsuddenly  discovered  how  important  it  was  to  keep  3500  units  of  low-­‐income  housing  for  blacks  in  West  Dallas  (even  though  they  \nhad  not  been  concerned  with  the  1300  units  that  had  been  vacant  and  boarded  for  over  ten

 \n80   This  is  discussed  in  the  Walker  II  opinion.  \n  \n  \n81   The  need  for  these  additional  resources  (and  others)—and  the  obligation  of  the  City  of  Dallas  to  cooperate  in  providing  \nthem—was  recognized  in  the  “Mayor’s  Housing  Mediation  Team  Report  (April  13,  1988).”  \n  \n  \n82   The  City  has  argued  that  its  joinder  is  not  necessary  because  other  parties,  primarily  HUD,  can  provide  the  “additional  resources”  \nthat  are  needed.  This  is  wrong.  The  Consent  Decree  provides  that  “under  no  circumstances  ...  shall  any  modification  increase,  \n  \nalter,  otherwise  affect  the  financial  or  other  obligations  of  HUD  pursuant  to  this  Decree  without  the  written  consent  of  HUD.”  \nConsent  Decree,  Summary  p.  3.  \n  \n83   The  City  also  contends  that  the  plaintiffs  waived  the  right  to  join  the  City  by  not  suing  it  before  the  entry  of  the  Consent  \nDecree—and  that  “the  Court  concurred  with  the  decision  that  complete  relief  did  not  require  joining  the  City.”  Again,  this  is  \n  \nsimply  wrong.  As  discussed  above,  although  the  City  was  not  a  party  to  the  Decree,  it  joined  in  the  negotiations  and  its  support  \nfor  the  Decree  was  promised  and  expected;  otherwise,  there  would  have  been  no  settlement.  Therefore,  there  was  no  “waiver”  \nby  the  plaintiffs’  decision  not  to  sue  the  City  at  that  time—and  this  Court,  when  approving  a  Consent  Decree  which  recited  that  \n“substantial  additional  resources”  were  necessary,  certainly  expected  the  City  to  support,  not  oppose,  the  Consent  Decree.  \n  \n  \n \n  \n     \n  \n \n  \n   25  \n  ",

 exhibit  #  33,  page  223].  This  efficient  planning  was  \nused  to  create  and  maintain  wide  ranging,  thorough,  unequal,  and  oppressive  racial  segregation  in  South  Africa  [Berry

Having reviewed the motion, the Court finds it is well-taken and should be and is\nhereby GRANTED. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the attached amendments to the Walker\nSettlement Voucher Implementation Plan are APPROVED. \nSO ORDERED on this 8th day of October, 2013.\n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2740-1   Filed 10/09/13    Page 1 of 78   PageID 5365\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS \nDALLAS DIVISION \n \nDEBRA WALKER, ET AL.      * \n            *   \nv.            * \n            *  3:85-CV-1210-O \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING  *     \nAND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, ET AL.,  *  CLASS ACTION \n            *   \n \nAgreed Amendments to the  \nWalker Settlement Voucher Implementation Plan \n \nThe following amendments to the Walker Settlement Voucher Implementation Plan are \napproved and agreed to by plaintiffs and the Housing Authority of the City of Dallas. \nThe most recent U.S. Census decennial racial data and other 2010 U.S. Census poverty \ndata changes the Eligible Census Tract status of some census tracts in the 7 county area. There \nwere least 9461 Walker Settlement Voucher households residing in census tracts that are no \nlonger  an Eligible Census Tract where Walker Settlement Vouchers (“WSV”) can be used.2\n A list of these households is attached (List WSV not in WTA.xlsx). There are some of \nthese households who, at their current location, do not need the WSV 125% of SAFMR payment \n                                                           \n1 This was the estimate as of February 27, 2013. \n2 The “Eligible Census Tract” or “Tracts” referred to in this implementation plan are those that \nmeet the criteria for “Predominantly White Areas” under the HUD Settlement Stipulation and \nOrder and the Order Approving Plan for DHA’S Implementation of HUD Settlement as DHA’s \nSection 8 Substitution Plan. The term “predominantly white area” means either (a) a census tract \nthat, according to the most recent decennial census, (i) has a black population at or below the \naverage black population of the City of Dallas, (ii) has no public housing other than scattered site \nsingle family homes, and (iii) has a poverty rate at or below the average for the City of Dallas; or \n(b) a census tract that the Plaintiffs and DHA agree should be treated as a \"predominantly white \narea.\" Order Approving Plan for DHA’S Implementation of HUD Settlement as DHA’s Section \n8 Substitution Plan, page 2, filed April 26, 2001. \n1 \n \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2740-1   Filed 10/09/13    Page 2 of 78   PageID 5366\nstandard. The gross rent for these households is already less than the 2013 SAFMR payment \nstandard adopted by DHA. \nAll prior court orders still in effect under the Agreed Final Judgment remain in effect. \nExcept to the extent that the Agreed Settlement Voucher Implementation Plan and Budget - 2007 \nand the 2008 Amendments to Sections IV and V of that plan are changed by the terms of this \nagreement, the 2007 plan and the 2008 amendments remain in effect. \n The list of the 2010 census tracts in the seven county area and the calculated 2010 U.S. \nCensus data status of those tracts as Eligible Census Tracts under the HUD Settlement \nStipulation and Order are attached. (WTA Eligible Tracts 2012 w cities.xlsx). The parties have \nagreed that tracts 130.04 (public housing in tract), 152.05 (Irving), 181.05 (Garland), 181.41 \n(Garland), 192.06 (UTD), 317.09 (40 units of public housing), and 318.04 (UTD) shall be \nconsidered Eligible Census Tracts under the Order Approving Plan for DHA’s Implementation \nof HUD Settlement as DHA’s Section 8 Substitution Plan, the Settlement Voucher \nImplementation Plans, and this agreement.  \n1. The effective date for the 2010 Census Eligible Census Tracts designations for purposes of \ndetermining payment standard changes for current Walker Settlement Voucher participants in \nexisting leases is October 1, 2013. \n2.  The payment standard changes for Walker Settlement Voucher Participants continuing \nto reside in the same unit after the effective date of the  status change will be implemented \npursuant to  24 CFR § 982.505(b)(3).  \nNotice and terms \n3.  DHA will send notice to current WSV Participants who are no longer living in an \n  -2- \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2740-1   Filed 10/09/13    Page 3 of 78   PageID 5367\nEligible Census Tract. The notice will advise the Participants that their current WSV will change \nto a regular Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (“HCV”) unless the Participant notifies DHA \nthat she or he wishes to move to a unit in a location in which the WSV can be used. The notice \nshould state that the change is because of changes in U.S. Census data.  DHA’s notice should \ninform the household that the change does not mean the family will lose their voucher. The \nnotice should state that the change will cause the voucher to become a regular HCV without the \n125% of FMR payment standard unless the household moves to an eligible location before the \nsecond regular re-examination after September 1, 2013. This deadline can be extended to the \nexpiration of the current lease term or for other good cause, such as waiting until the end of a \nschool year. \n4. The notice should provide the Participant with the name, phone number, and email \naddress of a DHA employee who can answer questions about the notice and the change. The \nnotice should provide the Participant with the Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.’s (“ICP”) \navailability to provide information about the notice and the change. The ICP telephone number \nto be provided is (214) 658-1330. The ICP email address to be provided is \ninfo@inclusivecommunities.net. \n5. The notice should inform the Participant that if she or he wants to continue as a WSV \nParticipant, then mobility counseling - including search assistance and financial assistance - will \nbe available for a move to an Eligible Census Tract. The notice should state that ICP’s mobility \ncounseling and search assistance is also available to the Participant. \nInterchange \n6. The WSV that are unassigned as a result of a Participant continuing to live in an area \n  -3- \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2740-1   Filed 10/09/13    Page 4 of 78   PageID 5368\nthat is no longer an Eligible Census Tract will be reassigned. The first priority for reassignment \nshall be HCV Participants in Eligible Census Tracts whose portion of the gross rent will increase \nmore than 10% because of the HUD Small Area Fair Market Rent set for the ZCTA that includes \nthe area. The second priority for reassignment shall be HCV Participants described in Section \nVII.D of the Agreed Settlement Voucher Implementation Plan and Budget - 2007. The third \npriority for reassignment shall be households on the WSV Database waiting list. \nWalker Settlement Voucher Database waiting list \n7. DHA created an online database where Plaintiff Class Members (as determined by the \nrace of the Head of Household) applied for a WSV and were listed in a random order in the \nDatabase.  DHA will mail notice to all persons listed in the Database, asking them to return a \npostcard to confirm that they wish to remain in the Database and requesting all current contact \ninformation.  DHA will update the Database accordingly.  The Database will be maintained and \nused for identifying candidates for the reissuance of WSVs as they become available and taking \nthe above priorities into account.  If the need arises, DHA will re-open the Database to additional \napplicants and will make computers available at DHA's administrative offices located at 3939 N. \nHampton, Dallas, TX 75212 for Class Members to apply. \nMobility Counseling Fund   \n8.  The funding committed for counseling services and financial assistance under HUD's \nSettlement Stipulation includes two pools of funds (mobility counseling and regional opportunity \ncounseling) which totaled $2,974,351 as of May 17, 2007.  DHA has used $960,453.15 through \nDecember 31, 2011 and will use remaining funds in the amount of $2,013,897.85 to provide \nservices related to mobility counseling (e.g. to pay landlord incentives and assist Participants \nwith application fees, security deposits, moving expenses, and utility deposits). This funding is \navailable for any WSV Participant moving to a unit in an Eligible Census Tract whether or not \n  -4- \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2740-1   Filed 10/09/13    Page 5 of 78   PageID 5369\nthe move is the initial move using a WSV. DHA will not deny the financial assistance to a WSV \nParticipant because ICP is providing mobility search assistance and other non-financial mobility \ncounseling to the Participant.  \nSecurity Deposit Assistance \n9. Upon request and execution of the HAP contract, DHA will provide assistance to \nParticipants to pay security deposits.  The amount of this assistance will be based upon the size \nof the unit shown on the WSV.  The payment will be equal to the lesser of the deposit charged by \nthe owner or the following: \nOne Bedroom: up to $250,   \nTwo Bedrooms: up to $500,   \nThree Bedrooms: up to $1,200,   \nFour Bedrooms: up to $1,500, \nFive Bedrooms: up to $1,800,  \nSix Bedrooms: up to $2,000. \n10. DHA will not pay Security Deposit Assistance on behalf of a Participant for amounts \nthat are higher than what is charged to unassisted tenants in the private rental market.  Payment \nfor security deposit assistance will be made directly to the owner or reimbursed to the \nParticipant, at the option of the Participant. \n11. Under state law, the landlord may deduct from the Security Deposit Assistance, the \namount for which the Participant is legally liable under the lease. Texas Property Code, Section \n92.104.  State law also requires the landlord to provide an itemized statement to the Participant \nsetting out the cost of repairs, if any, and an explanation of all amounts deducted from the \nsecurity deposit when the tenant moves. The refund of the Security Deposit Assistance will be \nmade directly to the Participant, who will not be eligible to receive additional Security Deposit \n  -5- \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2740-1   Filed 10/09/13    Page 6 of 78   PageID 5370\nAssistance from DHA. \n12. Landlord bonus incentive payments. \n The landlord bonus incentive payment process is modified as follows: \nDHA may pay an additional landlord incentive bonus payments to owners with properties \nin Eligible Census Tracts for Walker Settlement Voucher participants moving from non-Eligible \nCensus Tracts to Eligible Census Tracts. DHA may pay a total landlord incentive bonus equal to \none month’s contract rent if needed to obtain a unit for the Walker Settlement Voucher \nparticipant. \n13. Financial assistance for security deposits is limited to available funding provided \nthrough the mobility counseling funds referred to in paragraph 8 above.  \n14. DHA is authorized to spend no more than $150,000 per year to pay the salary and \nbenefits of DHA employees to assist in administering this agreement. The $150,000 per year \nmay also be used to pay costs related to updating and administering the waiting list (postage, \nsoftware costs, etc.)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  -6- \n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2740-1   Filed 10/09/13    Page 7 of 78   PageID 5371\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAGREED: \n \n \ns/Michael M.

Werner, Melissa Ann Miles, Haynes & Boone, Dallas, TX, for The Housing Authority of the City of\nDallas.\n[*]\nBefore JONES and SMITH, Circuit Judges, and SHAW , District Judge.\nEDITH H. JONES, Circuit Judge:\nThe Dallas Housing Authority (DHA), the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),\nand the City of Dallas were found liable several years ago for unconstitutional racial discrimination and\nsegregation within Dallas's public housing programs. The primary issue on this appeal is the constitutionality of\nthe provision of the district court's most recent remedial order that directs newly constructed units of public\nhousing to be located in \"predominantly white\" Dallas neighborhoods.\nSpecifically, this is an appeal from a final judgment in two actions that were consolidated for trial. In the first\naction, two homeowners and their homeowners' associations (\"Homeowners\") sought declaratory and injunctive\n[1]\nrelief against DHA's construction of two new public housing projects adjacent to their neighborhoods.  The\nHomeowners challenged the remedial order's provisions for new public housing construction and race-conscious\n976 site selection alleging that these *976 were not narrowly tailored to remedy the vestiges of past discrimination\nand segregation. In the second action, the original class plaintiffs, tenants in the public housing programs, sought\ndeclaratory relief that the remedial order provisions are constitutional. The district court entered judgment against\nthe Homeowners in the first action and for the class plaintiffs in the second action. The Homeowners appealed.\nWe essentially vacate and remand for further consideration by the district court.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\nPart of the convoluted history of this case is concisely recounted in Walker v. HUD, 912 F.2d 819, 821-25 (5th\nCir.1990) [hereinafter Walker IV]. We will not repeat that history here, but some important procedural and\nsubstantive gaps in this court's prior opinion, which addressed different issues, should be filled in.\nThis case began in 1985 and initially resulted in a consent decree, which was approved by the district court in\n1987. See Walker v. HUD, 734 F.Supp. 1231, 1247-72 (N.D.Tex. 1989) [hereinafter Walker I] (reprinting the\ndistrict court's 1987 consent decree and its \"Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law Approving the Proposed\n[2]\nConsent Decree\"). The consent decree addressed the plaintiff class's  challenge under the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to the purposeful racial discrimination and\nsegregation within DHA's public housing programs. The defendants were DHA and HUD. The City of Dallas was\njoined as both a defendant to the lawsuit and a party to the consent decree in 1989. See Walker v. HUD, 734\nF.Supp. 1289 (N.D.Tex. 1989) [hereinafter Walker III]. The history of public housing in Dallas is a sordid tale of\novert and covert racial discrimination and segregation. See generally Walker III, 734 F.Supp. at 1293-1312\n[3]\n(recounting in detail the history of public housing in Dallas). Virtually all non-elderly public housing units  were\n[4]\nconstructed in minority areas of Dallas.  No new public housing units were built between 1955 and 1989 at least\nin part for fear that they might be located in white areas. Tenant selection and assignment procedures for public\nhousing units were crafted and administered to maintain racially segregated projects. DHA's Section 8 housing\nprograms were operated to discourage blacks from moving into white areas of metropolitan Dallas. See id.\nBlacks were purposefully segregated for decades into either Section 8 housing in minority areas of Dallas or\npredominantly black housing projects in minority areas of Dallas.\nThe 1987 consent decree required the demolition of approximately 2,600 units of public housing in DHA's West\nDallas project, a public housing development located in a predominantly black area of the city and referred to by\n[5]\nthis court as \"one of Dallas's worst slums.\" Walker IV, 912 F.2d at 821. These units were to be replaced on a\n977 one-for-one *977 basis with additional public housing units and Section 8 certificates and vouchers. See id. at\n822. The decree also required that one hundred newly constructed replacement units be built in a predominantly\nwhite area of Dallas, that a nondiscriminatory tenant selection and assignment plan be implemented, and that a\nSection 8 mobility plan be established to assist black families joining the Section 8 program in finding housing in\n[6]\nwhite areas of Dallas.\nDHA repeatedly violated the 1987 consent decree. First, it resisted the construction of the 100 units of new public\nhousing in a predominantly white area. See Walker I, 734 F.Supp. at 1243-45. Site selection for and construction\nof the 100 units was eventually completed, but only by court order. See id. Second, DHA violated the tenant\nselection and assignment and mobility provisions of the decree. See id. at 1235-42. DHA failed to establish and\n[7]\nfund the required Section 8 mobility program, failed to timely obtain fair market exception rents,  delayed\nimplementing a nondiscriminatory tenant selection and assignment program, failed to include in Section 8\nhousing information a full list of all Section 8 units available in non-minority areas, and failed to use all of the\nSection 8 certificates and vouchers allocated by HUD to DHA. See id.\nIn March 1992, the district court vacated the 1987 consent decree on the grounds that its terms were not\nimplemented and that the vestiges of purposeful segregation persisted. Subsequently, the district court granted\nthe Walker plaintiffs' uncontested motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability. In September 1994, the\ndistrict court held a trial on the issue of a remedy. The district court entered its remedial order affecting DHA in\nFebruary 1995 and its remedial order affecting HUD in April 1996.\nThe remedial order affecting DHA requires DHA (1) to demolish at least 2,630 units of its West Dallas project, (2)\nto develop 2,807 replacement units for the demolished West Dallas units through both new construction and\n[8]\nSection 8 vouchers and certificates,  (3) to develop, either through construction or acquisition, an additional\n3,205 new units of public housing in predominantly white areas of metropolitan Dallas in which the poverty rate\ndoes not exceed 13%, and (4) to develop all new public housing units in predominantly white areas until there are\n\n978 as many units in predominantly white areas as there are in minority areas.[9] A \"predominantly *978 white area\" is\ndefined as less than 37% Hispanic, black, or other minority. The required 3,205 new units may be satisfied by the\n[10]\nuse of Section 8 certificates or vouchers, but only after court approval.  The construction costs for 674 of the\n[11]\n2,807 new replacement units have been previously allocated to DHA by HUD,  although only 75 of these units\n[12]\nare currently under construction or completed.\nThe Homeowners filed this suit against DHA and HUD to enjoin the construction of two new 40-unit public\n[13]\nhousing projects on sites adjacent to their neighborhoods.  The Homeowners allege that the remedy of new\nconstruction is not narrowly tailored because it requires that the new units be constructed in predominantly white\nareas. The Homeowners do not contest either the remedial order's poverty site-selection criterion or HUD's site-\nselection standards set forth in 24 C.F.R. § 941.202.\nIn response to the Homeowners' action, the Walker plaintiffs sought declaratory relief that the remedial order was\nconstitutional. The Homeowners' request for an injunction and the Walker plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action\nwere tried together in October 1996. The district court denied the Homeowners' injunctive relief and granted the\nWalker plaintiffs declaratory relief. The district court gave an oral opinion on August 25, 1997, entered final\n[14]\njudgment on September 18, 1997, and issued its written opinion on October 6, 1997.\nII. STANDING\nAs an initial matter, DHA and HUD challenge the Homeowners' standing to bring their suit. The burden of\nestablishing standing rests with the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction (i.e., the Homeowners). See \nUnited States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 743, 115 S.Ct. 2431, 2435, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995); Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). In a case that has proceeded to final\njudgment, the factual allegations supporting standing (if controverted) must be supported adequately by the\nevidence adduced at trial. See Hays, 515 U.S. at 743, 115 S.Ct. at 2435; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. at\n2137; Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 115 n. 31, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1616 n. 31, 60 L.Ed.2d\n66 (1979); see also CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & EDWARD H. COOPER, 13A FEDERAL\n[15]\nPRACTICE & PROCEDURE § 3531.15, at 105 (2d ed. 1984).\nThe irreducible constitutional minimum of standing is composed of three elements:\n979 First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact\"00an invasion of a legally *979 protected\n97\ninterest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical. Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct\ncomplained of. . . . Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be\nredressed by a favorable decision.\nHays, 515 U.S. at 742-43, 115 S.Ct. at 2435 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S.Ct. at 2136) (internal\ncitation and quotations omitted). In applying these constitutional standing requirements, the Court has adopted a\nprudential principle that bars the adjudication of \"generalized grievances\" against allegedly illegal government\n[16]\nconduct. See id. In the equal protection context, this prudential principle means that standing exists only for\nthose persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged discriminatory conduct. See id.\n(citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 755, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3326, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984)); see also Valley Forge\nChristian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 489 n. 26, 102\nS.Ct. 752, 768 n. 26, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (rejecting the proposition that every citizen has \"standing to\nchallenge every affirmative-action program on the basis of a personal right to a government that does not deny\nequal protection of the laws\").\nDHA and HUD principally contend that the Homeowners lack standing because they allege an injury that is\nconjectural and a generalized grievance. The essence of the Homeowners' complaint is twofold: (1) they have\nbeen purposefully discriminated against because of their race (i.e., they were intentionally singled out because of\ntheir race to accommodate two new public housing projects adjacent to their neighborhoods), and (2) this\n\ndecision has inflicted or threatens to inflict specific injury including decreased property values, increased crime\nand population density, environmental problems, and diminished aesthetic values of the neighborhood because\nDHA will fail to operate and maintain the two projects properly. The remedial order's explicit racial classification\nalone is sufficient to confer standing on these particular homeowners. In Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 104 S.Ct.\n3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984), the Supreme Court wrote regarding the \"stigmatizing injury\" caused by racial\ndiscrimination that \"[t]here can be no doubt that this sort of non-economic injury is one of the most serious\nconsequences of discriminatory government action and is sufficient in some circumstances to support standing.\" \nId. at 755, 104 S.Ct. at 3326. The Court continued, \"Our cases make clear, however, that such injury accords a\nbasis for standing only to `those persons who are personally denied equal treatment' by the challenged\ndiscriminatory conduct.\" Id.; see also City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson, 488 U.S. 469, 493, 109 S.Ct. 706, 721,\n102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (\"To whatever racial group these citizens belong, their `personal rights' to be treated with\nequal dignity and respect are implicated by a rigid rule erecting race as the sole criterion in an aspect of public\ndecisionmaking.\").\nUnder the remedial order, DHA selected the homeowners' neighborhood because they are white and they live in\nan area of Dallas that is at least 63% white. The remedial order also requires that new units not be located in\nareas where the poverty rate exceeds 13%. Thus, these homeowners' \"whiteness\" is one of two controlling\nelements which identified the specific sites adjacent to their neighborhoods for new public housing construction.\nWhen a homeowner's neighborhood adjoins a proposed public housing project whose site was determined by a\nrace-conscious standard, he has standing to sue because of the explicit racial classification. Cf. Hays, 515 U.S.\nat 744-45, 115 S.Ct. at 2436 (\"Where a plaintiff resides in a racially gerrymandered district, however, the plaintiff\n980 has been denied equal treatment because of the legislature's reliance on racial *980 criteria, and therefore has\nstanding to challenge the legislature's action.\").\nDHA and HUD cite three cases to support their contention that the Homeowners' injury is a generalized grievance\nlacking the specificity and particularity necessary to confer standing. Each case is easily distinguishable from the\ncase at hand. In Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 504-07, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2208-09, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), the\nplaintiffs alleged that an adjacent town's zoning ordinances effectively excluded low and moderate income\npersons from living in the town, but they could not demonstrate that the ordinances specifically precluded them\nfrom living in the adjacent town. In Apache Bend Apartments v. United States, 987 F.2d 1174, 1177 (5th\nCir.1993), the plaintiff-taxpayers were not seeking to litigate their own tax liability, but the tax liability of taxpayers\nwho were not before the court. And in Hays, 515 U.S. at 744-45, 115 S.Ct. at 2436, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995), the\nplaintiffs were denied standing to challenge a reapportionment plan because they did not live in the district that\nwas the focus of their claim. In contrast to these three cases, the Homeowners live in neighborhoods next door to\nthe proposed new 40-unit housing projects, and the location of these projects was selected specifically because\nof the homeowners' race.\nIn general, the racial classification of the homeowners is an injury in and of itself. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S.\n630, 643, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 2824, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993) (\"Classifications of citizens solely on the basis of race\nare by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. They\nthreaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility.\"\n(internal citations omitted)). But the Homeowners also allege that constructing two new 40-unit public housing\nprojects adjacent to their neighborhoods will cause a decline in their property values and other problems involving\ncrime, traffic and diminished aesthetic values. Relying on the district court's fact finding that the Homeowners\nhave not suffered such an economic injury caused by the new public housing projects, HUD and DHA challenge\nwhether the Homeowners have in fact suffered a decrease in property values. Despite this finding, we cannot\nconclude, having reviewed the record, that the Homeowners did not put forth adequate evidence at trial to confer\nstanding upon them. The district court did not hold that the Homeowners lack standing, as he was well aware of\nthe potential for neighborhood disruption traceable to improperly managed public housing projects. HUD and\nDHA cite no cases in which standing has been denied to homeowners who asserted their quality of life and\nproperty values would be diminished by a next-door public housing or other HUD project. The caselaw is to the\n[17]\ncontrary.\n\n[18]\nIn sum, the Homeowners alleged and sufficiently proved facts that were adequate to support standing to sue.\n981 The injury they assert is not too abstract or conjectural. The *981 line of causation between the alleged\nunconstitutional conduct and the injury is not attenuated. And the prospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a\nresult of a favorable ruling is not speculative.\nIII. HOMEOWNERS' EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIM\nThe district court held that the Homeowners failed to allege an equal protection violation. The Homeowners\nchallenge this conclusion.\nA. Lack of a Similarly Situated Group\nThe district court, citing Samaad v. City of Dallas, 940 F.2d 925 (5th Cir.1991), found that the Homeowners failed\nto show an equal protection violation because they did not identify a similarly situated set of black persons who\nhave been treated better. See id. at 941 n. 31 This requirement, however, applies only to equal protection claims\ninvolving facially neutral government actions, where it is necessary to establish that the government is\ndistinguishing or classifying persons on the basis of race. See id. at 941. Explicit racial classifications, in contrast,\nestablish unequal treatment by their very nature. See Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642, 113 S.Ct. at 2824 (\"Laws that\nexplicitly distinguish between individuals on racial grounds fall within the core of [the Equal Protection Clause's]\nprohibition.\"). Because the Homeowners challenge an explicit racial classification within the district court's\nremedial order, they have properly alleged an equal protection violation.\nThe district court also suggested that the Homeowners failed to demonstrate an equal protection violation\nbecause \"[t]he impact [of the new construction], if any, on the Homeowners will be considerably less than [the]\nimpact of the existing DHA public housing projects on the property owners in the black neighborhoods with\nexisting projects.\" The district court's reasoning is incorrect: racial classifications are not acceptable simply\nbecause they are perceived to have little impact. Any explicit racial classification, regardless of the burdens or\nbenefits its imposes, is suspect and subject to strict scrutiny. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S.\n200, 227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 2113, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995) (\"[A]ll racial classifications, imposed by whatever\nfederal, state, or local government actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\"); Powers v.\nOhio, 499 U.S. 400, 410, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1370, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991) (\"It is axiomatic that racial classifications\ndo not become legitimate on the assumption that all persons suffer them in equal degree.\").\nB. Intent to Discriminate\nThe district court held that the Homeowners failed to prove an equal protection violation because there is no\nintent to treat whites worse than similarly situated blacks. Once again, the district court is incorrect. An explicit\nracial classification does not require any inquiry into \"intent\" in order to allege an equal protection violation. See \nShaw, 509 U.S. at 642, 113 S.Ct. at 2824 (\"No inquiry into legislative purpose is necessary when the racial\nclassification appears on the face of the statute.\"). \"Express racial classifications are immediately suspect\nbecause, `[a]bsent searching judicial inquiry ..., there is simply no way of determining whether classifications are\n\"benign\" or \"remedial\" and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or\nsimple racial politics.'\" Id. at 642-43, 113 S.Ct. at 2824 (quoting Croson, 488 U.S. at 493, 109 S.Ct. at 721).\nThe district court's skepticism of the Homeowners' right to pursue an equal protection claim was unfounded, so\nwe proceed to address the merits of their claim.\nIV. NARROW TAILORING\nThe primary issue on appeal is whether the remedial order's requirement that new public housing units be built or\nacquired in \"predominantly white areas\" is narrowly tailored to remedy the vestiges of past discrimination and\n\nsegregation within Dallas's public housing programs. No party suggests on appeal that the racial steering, which\n[19]\nfor so many years was a part of Dallas's public housing programs, has not been effectively eradicated.\n982 Rather, the parties' dispute *982 centers on the district court's efforts to rectify the effects of the now-past\ndiscriminatory practices of DHA, HUD, and the City of Dallas. In short, is it constitutional in this case to implement\na race-conscious site selection criterion for newly built or acquired public housing?\nAny race-conscious remedial measure receives strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. See Adarand,\n515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.Ct. at 2113; Black Fire Fighters Ass'n v. Dallas, 19 F.3d 992, 995 (5th Cir.1994)\n[hereinafter BFFA]. This is true no matter which race is burdened or benefitted by the racial classification in\nquestion. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224, 115 S.Ct. at 2111 (citing Croson, 488 U.S. at 494, 109 S.Ct. at 722).\nStrict scrutiny requires that a racial classification be (1) justified by a compelling government interest and (2)\nnarrowly tailored to further that interest. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.Ct. at 2113. The Homeowners do\nnot contest that there exists a compelling government interest in this case. Therefore, our inquiry focuses on\nwhether the remedial order is narrowly tailored.\nIn assessing whether a remedy is narrowly tailored, courts are to assess five factors: (1) the necessity for relief,\n(2) the efficacy of alternative remedies, (3) the flexibility and duration of relief, (4) the relationship of the numerical\ngoals to the relevant market, and (5) the impact of the relief on the rights of third parties. See United States v.\nParadise, 480 U.S. 149, 171, 107 S.Ct. 1053, 1066, 94 L.Ed.2d 203 (1987); BFFA,19 F.3d at 995. Before\nexamining these factors, however, we must address the standard of review.\nWhen a district court's race-conscious remedial measure is challenged as not being narrowly tailored, the party\ndefending the remedial measure bears the burden of producing evidence that the remedial measure is\nconstitutional. See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 277-78, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 1848-49; Aiken v. City\nof Memphis, 37 F.3d 1155, 1162 (6th Cir.1994); see also Raso v. Lago, 135 F.3d 11, 20 (1st Cir.1998) (Stahl, J.,\ndissenting). The party challenging the remedial measure, of course, bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat the racial classification is unconstitutional. See id.\nIn general, we review a district court's legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. However,\n\"if the trial court bases its findings upon a mistaken impression of applicable legal principles, the reviewing court\nis not bound by the clearly erroneous standard.\" Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 855 n. 15,\n102 S.Ct. 2182, 2189 n. 15, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982); see also United States v. Bentley-Smith, 2 F.3d 1368, 1373\n(5th Cir.1993).\nIn the case at hand, the district court placed the burden of production, as well as the ultimate burden of proof, on\nthe Homeowners. Because he improperly placed the burden of production, we are not bound by the clearly\nerroneous standard in reviewing his findings of fact. Nonetheless, although more rigorous review may be in order,\nwe will deferentially examine the district court's findings because this is a complicated case in which the district\ncourt has a decade's worth of experience with Dallas's public housing programs.\nRace-conscious remedies must be narrowly tailored to eliminate the effects of past discrimination as well as bar\nlike discrimination in the future. See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 172-175, 107 S.Ct. at 1067-68; id. at 183, 107 S.Ct. at\n1073 (citing Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. 145, 154, 85 S.Ct. 817, 822, 13 L.Ed.2d 709 (1965)). \"Racial\nclassifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and\nclassification.\" Adarand, 515 U.S. at 229, 115 S.Ct. at 2113 (quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 537,\n100 S.Ct. 2758, 2805, 65 L.Ed.2d 902 (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting)). This means that a race-conscious\nremedy must be framed to address the exact effects and harms of the discrimination at issue. See Wygant, 476\nU.S. at 280, 106 S.Ct. at 1850.\nIn application, arriving at an exact fit between harm and remedy requires consideration of whether a race-neutral\nor less restrictive remedy could be used. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 237-38, 115 S.Ct. at 2118; Wygant, 476 U.S.\n983 at 280 n. 6, 106 S.Ct. at 1850 n. 6. This is because a race-conscious *983 remedy should be the remedy of last\nresort. See Alexander v. Estepp, 95 F.3d 312, 316 (4th Cir.1996) (\"[E]xplicit racial preferences, if available at all,\nmust be only a `last resort' option.\"). A \"race-conscious remedy will not be deemed narrowly tailored until less\n\nsweeping alternatives00particularly race neutral ones00have been considered and tried.\" Williams v. Babbitt, 115\n97 97\n[20]\nF.3d 657, 666 (9th Cir.1997).\nThe first two Paradise factors are the necessity for relief and efficacy of alternative remedies. These weigh\nagainst race-conscious site selection for two reasons. First, Section 8 housing vouchers have not been given a\nfair try to prove their potential to desegregate. Second, other criteria than a racial standard will ensure the\ndesegregated construction or acquisition of any new public housing. See infra, text at n. 31.\nThe Homeowners argue that Section 8 alone is capable of remedying the effects of past discrimination in Dallas's\npublic housing programs, and they contend that Section 8 has not been given a fair try. They also point out, and\nthe district court agrees, that Section 8 is more cost-efficient than new construction and is preferred by the\nmajority of public housing program participants. Section 8 is more flexible than fixed public housing because the\nparticipants may decide where and in what type facility to reside. As a result, virtually all available Section 8\nvouchers have been snapped up in Dallas.\nUnfortunately, however, numerous programs that would encourage and assist black families to use Section 8 in\npredominantly white areas had been in effect or fully operational for only a short time before trial on the\nHomeowners' case. For instance, the record indicates that DHA's mobility program had been operating as\n[21]\noriginally proposed by the Walker plaintiffs and the district court since only approximately 1994.  In addition,\n[22]\nexceptions to the \"fair market rent\" caps on Section 8 vouchers and certificates have been slow in coming.  It\nalso appears that potential Section 8 landlords may now be paid \"signing bonuses\" for accepting Section 8\ntenants. These are but three examples of numerous \"helping-hands\" that may be employed to promote the\n[23]\nsuccess of Section 8 as a desegregation tool.  While the history and timing of their implementation by DHA\nand HUD in this case are not perfectly clear, it is evident from the record that they were not programs of long-\n984 standing before trial. If Section 8, combined with such assistance programs, is an effective desegregation tool, \n*984 then Section 8 is superior to a race-conscious remedy in that it allows market forces and personal\npreferences rather than racial criteria to guide the homemaking decision.\nThe district court found, agreeing with the Walker plaintiffs, DHA, and HUD, that Section 8 needed to be\ncombined with new construction or acquisition in predominantly white areas in order to remedy the effects of past\ndiscrimination. Adopting the Walker plaintiffs' proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in toto, the court\nconcluded that Section 8 alone was an inadequate remedy for several reasons: there are not enough Section 8\nunits in predominantly white areas; among the available units there is a lack of three and four bedroom units;\nrents in predominantly white areas are too high to be covered even by Section 8's fair market exception rents;\nlandlords do not want to participate in the Section 8 program; and Section 8 participants become frustrated in\nlooking for housing in predominantly white areas and settle for housing in minority areas. The court also found\nthat rental contract requirements in predominantly white areas contain provisions that are difficult for Section 8\nfamilies to meet (e.g., high security deposits, requirement of having held a job for the past year, etc..). We neither\naccept nor attempt to reject these factual findings. Rather, there is one overarching factual finding by the district\ncourt00which is uncontested by all parties00that transcends the parties' objections to Section 8 as a remedial\n97 97\nmeasure.\nIn 1987, when the district court first found DHA in violation of its original consent decree, a negligible number of\n[24]\nblack families in DHA's Section 8 programs lived in predominantly white areas.  In contrast, in September\n[25]\n1994, approximately 1,050 Section 8 black families lived in predominantly white areas.  And in the fall of 1996,\n[26]\nthere were approximately 1,335 Section 8 black families in predominantly white areas.  These numbers show\nthat in the two year period between 1994 and 1996, the number of Section 8 black families living in predominantly\nwhite areas increased by 285, or 27%. And it was during this same time period that DHA's Section 8 mobility\nprogram was getting fully underway. The program currently in place, which the district court has not criticized,\nessentially became fully operational around 1994. Based on the relative success of DHA in moving blacks into\npredominantly white areas via its Section 8 program between 1994 and 1996, the Walker plaintiffs, HUD, and\nDHA have produced insufficient evidence to show that the district court's race-conscious site selection criterion is\nnecessary to remedy the effects of past discrimination. Cf. In re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Employment\n985 Litig., 20 F.3d 1525, 1545-47 (11th Cir.1994);[27]see also BFFA,19 F.3d at *985 995 (\"The broad skip promotion\n\nremedy in the decree is difficult to justify when the knowledge to narrow it seems readily available.\"). Section 8, a\nrace-neutral remedial measure, is increasingly successful at moving black families into white areas, and the\nrecord indicates that it could be even more successful with, for example, increased funding for both more\n[28] [29] [30]\nvouchers and the mobility program,  more mobility counselors,  and higher fair market exception rents.\nWhen Section 8 has evidenced such promising results, options such as these should be explored and tested\nbefore adopting a race-conscious remedy as a last resort.\nAdditionally, it is unnecessary to employ the race-conscious site selection criterion ordered by the court even if\nnew construction or acquisition of public housing occurs. The district court may proceed with new construction as\npart of his remedial plan, but he may not do so using a race-conscious site selection criterion. Of course, other\ncriteria may be employed to guide site selection for new construction. See United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ.,\n837 F.2d 1181, 1184, 1236-37 (2d Cir.1987) (using a geographical site selection criterion for public housing). The\ndistrict court has already mandated that all new sites be in areas where the poverty rate does not exceed 13%.\n[31]\n The district court's concern that if it does not attach a race-conscious site selection criterion to new\nconstruction, then the new units will end up in minority areas and, as a consequence, Dallas's public housing\n[32]\nprojects will almost all remain in minority areas, is unfounded.\nIn deciding that Section 8 and nonracial site selection criteria should be implemented before a racial standard, we\nare mindful of the \"respect owed a district judge's judgment that specified relief is essential to cure a violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\" Paradise, 480 U.S. at 183, 107 S.Ct. at 1073. Nonetheless, a district court's broad\n[33]\nequitable powers remain constrained by the boundaries of narrow tailoring.  The recent success of Section 8\nand the availability of viable nonracial, non-discriminatory site selection criteria, combined with the factors\ndiscussed in the following paragraphs, demonstrate that the remedial order's race-conscious site selection\ncriterion is not narrowly tailored.\nFirst, DHA, HUD, and the City of Dallas are all cooperating defendants. That is to say, DHA, HUD, and the City of\nDallas no longer discriminate against black families in DHA's public housing programs, and00by all accounts in\n97\nthe record00all three defendants are active participants in crafting and implementing remedial measures to\n97\neliminate the vestiges of past discrimination. In contrast, the Supreme Court approved a race-conscious remedy\nin Paradise in large part because earlier, less restrictive remedies had proven ineffective since the defendant\ncontinually resisted their implementation and stonewalled in developing acceptable procedures for the\nadvancement of black troopers within the Alabama Department of Public Safety. See Paradise, 480 U.S. at\n986 162-65, 107 S.Ct. at 1062-63 (describing the Department's continuing failure to comply with the *986 parties'\nconsent decrees); id. at 170-71, 176-77, 107 S.Ct. at 1066, 1069; see also BFFA,19 F.3d at 996 (finding a race-\nconscious remedial measure unnecessary, in part, because the defendant was a willing party to the settlement of\nthe lawsuit). Where, as here, the defendants have begun making race-neutral, good faith, and effective efforts to\nremedy the wrongs of the past, a race-conscious remedy should only be a last resort.\nSecond, the district court, in his 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, made references to the necessity of a race-conscious site\nselection criterion because some participants in DHA's public housing programs do not want and should not be\n[34]\nforced to use Section 8.  While some may find it difficult to use Section 8, a race-conscious remedial measure\nis not justified by certain class members' objections to looking for housing on their own versus their being offered\na unit owned and operated by DHA. A race-conscious remedy is justified, after race-neutral remedies have been\nconsidered and found wanting, if it is the only effective means by which to remedy the effects of past\ndiscrimination. It is by this standard alone that the district court must assess his remedial orders. As applied to the\nfacts of this case, the district court's concern seems particularly irrelevant as only 474 new units in predominantly\nwhite areas are currently funded, and those units must be filled by Section 8 families who participate in DHA's\n[35]\nFamily Self-Sufficiency Program.  That is, they will be filled by the \"cream-of-the-crop\" from DHA's waiting\nlists. Thus, those who in all probability need public housing units the least (because they would be successful\nSection 8 participants) will be directed to the new units, while those for whom the district court expresses concern\nwill be left with Section 8. DHA's rationale for filling the new units with participants in its self-sufficiency program is\ncommendable, but it throws askew part of the district court's reasoning regarding the remedial need for new\nconstruction in addition to Section 8.\n\nThird, it remains unclear why there is an absolute remedial necessity to build 474 new units of public housing\nusing a racial classification when (1) 2,033 (or 72%) of the remedial order's 2,807 replacement units will be\nSection 8 and (2) DHA and HUD may submit a plan to use Section 8 for all of the 3,205 additional units of public\n[36]\nhousing to be built in predominantly white areas.\nIn sum, out of a total of 6,012 units within the remedial order, only 474 (or 8%) must00assuming an acceptable\n97\nSection 8 plan is submitted for the 3,205 additional units00be new construction in predominantly white areas. If\n97\nSection 8 can effectively satisfy the district court's remedial goal regarding 5,628 units, it is baffling to assume\nthat it cannot do so for an additional 474 units.\nDHA, HUD, and the City of Dallas offer two responses to this criticism. First, they argue that 474 units is a tiny\nproportion of the overall number of units contemplated by the remedial order; the deference due a district court in\nfashioning a remedial order should protect such a small element of the overall remedial plan. This would be\ncorrect if the 474 units were not attached to a racial classification which requires that they be built in\n987 predominantly white areas. Racial classifications, even small ones, receive strict *987 scrutiny. Second, they\ncontend that if the 474 units already funded by HUD are not built in white areas, they will either not be built at all\nor will be built in minority areas which will only further the racial segregation of DHA's public housing projects. As\ndiscussed previously, the district court may entertain any number of site selection criteria regarding new public\nhousing units, except for race. No one suggests that the 474 units should not be built, only that requiring that they\nbe built using a race-conscious site selection criterion is not narrowly tailored.\nThe fourth Paradise factor, the relationship of numerical goals to the relevant markets, also cuts against the race-\n[37]\nconscious site-selection criterion in the remedial order.  The district court's remedial goal is to have half of the\nfamilies in DHA's public housing programs (either public housing units or Section 8) in predominantly white areas\nof Dallas and half in \"minority areas\". The justification for this goal is that Dallas's population is approximately half\nwhite and half \"minority\" and, therefore, public housing should be divided accordingly. This goal is overly broad.\nThis suit was brought by black plaintiffs on behalf of a class of black plaintiffs. There is no suggestion that the suit\never expanded to include all minorities or that any liability of the public agencies to other minorities could be\nfound. The court's definition of a \"predominantly white\" neighborhood, with 63% white population, is also based\non the idea that public housing may not be placed in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of Hispanics.\nThere is no evidence in the record to support the court's arbitrary definition of a predominantly white\nneighborhood. The emphasis should instead be directed toward placing public housing participants in\nneighborhoods of their choice through a vigorous Section 8 program, non-black neighborhoods, census tracts in\n[38]\nwhich no public housing currently exists, or non-poor neighborhoods.\nThe fifth Paradise factor is the impact of a racially-conscious site selection criterion on the rights of third parties.\nAmong all the groups affected by Dallas public housing, only these Homeowners have maintained that they\nwould be injured by the racially-based site selection process that occurred here. Despite the court's having\npurportedly found against them on this issue, the totality of the remedial order is far more ambivalent. The district\ncourt ordered stringent criteria for the design and upkeep of the projects and for tenant selection here and in\nanother \"predominantly white\" neighborhood (the Frankford & Marsh site, see supra, n.12), and he called for the\nparticipation of neighboring community members, like these Homeowners, in planning the projects. The court\nshowed considerable sensitivity to the fact that public housing has in the past been disgracefully neglected in\nDallas. The resulting remedial order thus cuts both ways with respect to the Homeowners' rights. On one hand, it\nattempts to placate their fears of deterioration in their neighborhoods. On the other hand, it lends credibility to\nthose fears.\nBecause there are promising, non-racially discriminatory ways to continue desegregating public housing in\nDallas, the provision of the court's remedial order calling for the construction or acquisition of units of public\nhousing in \"predominantly white\" areas is unconstitutional. Under the balance of the Paradise factors, the\ncriterion is not narrowly tailored, and it is premature to utilize such a last-resort measure. We must vacate and\nremand this portion of the remedial order for further consideration.\nIn so doing, we emphasize several points. First, increased reliance on Section 8 demands that the public\nagencies implement a vigorous mobility plan that serves the relocation needs and concerns of black families,\n\n988 reaches out to white landlords, affords adequate fair market rent exceptions, and combats *988 illegal private\ndiscrimination. Second, this opinion does not deal with the remedial order's nondiscriminatory tenant selection\nand assignment provisions, which are not challenged by the Homeowners. Third, this opinion does not preclude\nthe construction or acquisition of additional public housing if sites are selected by means of nonracial criteria. But\nwe also recognize that Section 8 is overwhelmingly preferred by public housing families, that it allows market\nforces and personal preferences to control the homemaking decision, and that it has not proven ineffective at\ndesegregating Dallas's public housing programs when combined with a vigorous mobility program. As applied to\nthe facts of this case, the district court erred in employing a race-conscious remedy before utilizing race-neutral\nalternatives.\nV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court's remedial order is VACATED to the extent indicated and the case is\nREMANDED for further proceedings; the declaratory judgment awarded to the Walker plaintiffs is REVERSED;\nand this court's stay of construction at the sites adjacent to the Homeowners' subdivisions shall be ENFORCED\nuntil the district court holds additional hearings and enters a remedial order revised in accordance with the\nforegoing opinion.\nRemedial order VACATED and REMANDED; declaratory judgment for Walker plaintiffs REVERSED; stay\nENFORCED pending entry of revised remedial order.\n[*] District Judge of the Western District of Louisiana, sitting by designation.\n[1] The two homeowners' associations are: (1) Highlands of McKamy IV and V Community Improvement\nAssociation and (2) Preston Highlands Homeowners' Association, Inc.\n[2] The consent decree defined the plaintiff class as \"all black persons presently or who during the pendency of\nthis Decree become either (a) residents of a DHA owned or managed project, or (b) participants in the DHA\nSection 8 Existing Housing Program.\" See Walker I, 734 F.Supp. at 1263. \nThe plaintiff class will be referred to throughout this opinion as the \"Walker plaintiffs.\" Deborah Walker is one of\nthe named plaintiffs representing the class.\n[3] \"Public housing units\" refer to housing units owned and operated by DHA.

It is\nthe second largest public housing project in the United States. See id. at 1296 n. 21. As of 1983, one-third of its\nunits were so dilapidated as to be uninhabitable. See id. at 1307. In 1986, rejection rates for available units in the\nWest Dallas project ranged from 58-60%. See id. at 1308. At that time, there were 1,583 vacant units of which\n1,300 had been boarded up for more than ten years because of their deteriorated state. See id. The 1987\nconsent decree was designed to alter this concentration of public housing by requiring the demolition of all but\napproximately 900 of the West Dallas units, the reconfiguration and rehabilitation of the remaining units, and the\ncreation of new public housing opportunities in predominantly white areas of the city and its suburbs.\n[6] The Section 8 mobility program was designed to educate landlords about the Section 8 program and to assist\nSection 8 participants in locating Section 8 housing in non-minority areas of Dallas. Specifically, the program was\nto include landlord recruitment, exceptions to HUD's \"fair market value\" rent caps on Section 8 vouchers and\n\ncertificates, Title VIII enforcement actions, and child care and transportation services. The program was also to\nprovide neighborhood specific information on crime rates, job training and employment opportunities, day care,\nmedical facilities, neighborhood shopping, transportation, social services, objective indicators of school quality\nsuch as TAAS test results, and \"environmental hazards or other conditions inimical to family life.\"\n[7] The value of a Section 8 voucher or certificate is capped by HUD at the \"fair market rent.\" This cap, however,\ncan be increased by special application to HUD.\n[8] These 2,807 units have already been funded by HUD. The 2,807 units are made up of 774 new public housing\nunits and 2,033 Section 8 certificates and vouchers. Specifically, the replacement units consist of (i) the 100 units\nconstructed pursuant to court order from the 1987 consent decree, (ii) 1,335 Section 8 certificates and vouchers\npreviously funded by HUD, (iii) 339 new public housing units allocated to DHA in 1990 and 1991 as part of the\nproposed 2,000 unit West Dallas project, (iv) 335 new public housing units allocated under HOPE VI in 1994 as\nreplacement units for West Dallas, and (v) 698 additional Section 8 vouchers promised by HUD. Therefore, there\nare 674 new units of public housing currently funded but not under construction. Eighty of these units are\nspecifically at issue in this case.\n[9] The source of this final detail of the district court's remedial order is unclear. The written order itself is\nconfusing. Paragraph A.3 requires that all of the 3,205 new units be built in predominantly white areas. \nIn slight contrast, the district court reiterates throughout his oral and written opinions that all of the 674 new units\nof public housing (i.e., the ones currently funded by HUD but not under construction) \"and any other allocated in\nthe future, must be developed in predominantly white areas until there are approximately as many non-elderly\npublic housing units in those areas as in minority areas.\" 10/6/97 Written Opinion, at 22. The district court goes\non to say, \"The race conscious site selection remedy is limited. It applies only until there is a comparable number\nof public housing units in white and minority areas.\" Id. at 22-23; see also 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, at 22 (\"Again, the\n674 units must be placed in white non-minority areas until there are as many public housing units in white areas\nas in minority areas.\").\n[10] To date, no plan for the use of Section 8 certificates or vouchers has been submitted to the district court.\nHowever, HUD states in its brief to this court that it \"expects to meet this obligation by providing funding for\nSection 8 certificates and vouchers for all of the 3,205 units, at a rate of 320 units per year for 10 years. Thus, it\nis likely that the only public housing units developed under the Remedial Orders will be the 774 units already\nallocated by HUD and designated as replacement units under paragraph A.1 of the HUD Remedial Order and\nparagraph A.2 of the DHA Remedial Order.\"\n[11] The district court authorized that 200 of the replacement units may be used in the reconfiguration and\nrevitalization of the West Dallas project.\n[12] The 75 units either under construction or completed are at DHA's Frankford & Marsh site.\n[13] One site is at the intersection of McCallum and Meandering Way, and the other site is at the intersection of\nHillcrest and Highway 190.\n[14] These opinions will hereinafter be cited respectively as: 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, 9/18/97 Final Judgment, and\n10/6/97 Written Opinion.\n[15] \"If this were an appeal from a judgment granting the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing, we\nwould be required to accept as true all of the material allegations of the complaint. However, because we are\nreviewing a final judgment based upon a fully developed record, we must evaluate standing from all materials of\nrecord.\" Pollard v. Cockrell, 578 F.2d 1002, 1006 (5th Cir.1978) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n[16] A \"generalized grievance\" is a harm \"shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens.\"\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). \"The prudential principle barring\nadjudication of `generalized grievances' is closely related to the constitutional requirement of personal `injury in\nfact,' and the policies underlying both are similar.\" Apache Bend Apartments, Ltd. v. United States, 987 F.2d\n1174, 1176 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc).\n\n[17]See Alschuler v. HUD, 686 F.2d 472, 476-77 (7th Cir.1982); South East Lake View Neighbors v. HUD, 685\nF.2d 1027, 1034-35 (7th Cir.1982); Society Hill Civic Ass'n v. Harris, 632 F.2d 1045, 1054 (3d Cir.1980).\n[18] As a subsidiary matter, DHA contends that the Homeowners lack standing because their alleged injury would\nnot be redressed by the invalidation of the remedial order's requirement that public housing be built only in\n\"predominantly white areas.\" In other words, DHA argues that it could have selected the two sites in question\neven without the race-conscious site selection criterion. \nDHA applies the wrong legal standard. The test is whether DHA would have selected these two sites absent the\nrace-conscious criterion, not whether it could have selected the sites. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 504, 95 S.Ct. at\n2208 (framing the standing question as whether, absent the challenged zoning ordinances that allegedly\nexcluded low-income persons from living in the town of Penfield, there was a substantial probability that the\nplaintiff would have been able to obtain such housing). There is no evidence in the record that DHA would have\nchosen the two sites in question absent the race-conscious criterion, and the Walker plaintiffs admit in their brief\nto this court that \"[t]he record is clear that DHA would not have chosen the sites absent the court order.\"\nAdditionally, HUD argues that the Homeowners are challenging the wrong part of the remedial order by\ncontesting the 3,205 additional units of public housing that must be built in predominantly white areas. It is quite\nclear from the record, however, that the Homeowners have properly challenged the two 40-unit projects, which\nwere selected on a race-conscious basis to be built next to their neighborhoods. Obviously, these two projects\nare part of a larger remedial scheme that is affected by this court's opinion herein.\n[19]See 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, at 5 (\"From the very beginning the primary purpose that DHA had was to prevent\nblacks from moving into white areas of the city and the suburbs. That is not true of DHA today....\").\n[20] It is true that in Hills v. Gautreaux, the Supreme Court did not disapprove a remedial order which, to end\ndiscrimination in public housing, required housing to be built in nonblack neighborhoods of Chicago. See 425\nU.S. 284, 296, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 1546, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976). But the Court did not consider the propriety of that\nremedy as opposed to a non-race conscious remedy like a vigorous Section 8 program. The only disputed issue\nin that case was whether the remedy could extend beyond the city limits of Chicago. Further, Hills predates\nsignificant changes that have occurred both in HUD's approach to public housing and in the scrutiny afforded\nrace-conscious remedies. Hills does not mandate either the construction of new public housing or race-conscious\nsite selection. We must review the application of the Paradise factors, which the district court correctly\nunderstood to frame the issues here.\n[21]See 10/30/96 Testimony of Ann Lott, Director of DHA's Section 8 Mobility Program (agreeing that most of the\nefforts to improve DHA's mobility program have been within the preceding two years); 8/7/96 Deposition of Lott\n(explaining new procedures within DHA's mobility program that were implemented in the prior year, including a\nmarketing campaign for prospective landlords, a landlord newsletter, and private briefings for landlords on the\nSection 8 program). But see 10/30/96 Testimony of Lori Moon, President & CEO of DHA (stating that DHA's\nmobility efforts have been in effect since 1989).\n[22] It is unclear from the record whether HUD has granted DHA a 120% fair market exception rent across-the-\nboard for all Section 8 housing in predominantly white areas. It is also unclear whether DHA could be granted fair\nmarket rent exceptions higher than 120%. Evidence in the record shows that a 160% fair market exception rent\nwould significantly increase the availability of Section 8 housing in predominantly white areas. Prior to\nimplementing a race-conscious remedy, it would seem advisable to ensure (1) that rent exceptions above 120%\nare foreclosed, as they offer the potential to break-down a significant barrier to an even more effective Section 8\nprogram, or (2) that 120% fair market exception rents have been fully implemented and tried, if that is the\nstatutory maximum.\n[23] Another example would be the vigorous enforcement of state and federal laws prohibiting racial\ndiscrimination by private Section 8 landlords.\n[24] The Walker plaintiffs state that in 1987 there were 66 Section 8 black families living in predominantly white\nareas, which amounted to approximately 2.4% of all black families in DHA's Section 8 program.\n\n[25] According to testimony in the record, this amounted to approximately 21% of all black families in DHA's\nSection 8 program.\n[26] According to testimony in the record, this amounted to approximately 24-25% of all black families in DHA's\nSection 8 program.\n[27] In In re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Employment Litigation, nonblack employees of the Birmingham\nFire Rescue Service (BFRS) challenged a 1981 consent decree entered into by the City of Birmingham that\nrequired, inter alia, that 50% of all promotions to the rank of BFRS lieutenant would be filled by qualified blacks (\ni.e., for every two promotions to lieutenant, one must be filled by a black candidate). See id.\nThe 11th Circuit noted that between 1978 and 1981, BFRS significantly increased its total number of black\nemployees from 8 to 42, which represented a shift in the black percentage of BFRS's workforce from 1.89% to\n9.3%. See id. This was achieved without the use of a race-conscious remedy. See id. The court stated that \"there\nis strong evidence in the record of this case that the City had implemented effective alternatives to race-based\nquotas to remedy its prior discriminatory behavior.\" Id. \"While the district court correctly concluded that, when the\ndecree was entered, no black had as yet become a fire lieutenant, we believe that, given the City's progress at\nthe entry-level, alternative measures designed to increase black representation in the fire lieutenant ranks were\nfeasible.\" Id. The court proceeded to list the non-race-based remedies that the plaintiffs proposed regarding\npromotion to BFRS lieutenant. See id. at 1546-47. It then concluded, \"Considering the efficacy of the alternative\nremedies, the relief provided in the decree cannot be reconciled with the requirement that a government's use of\nrace must be narrowly tailored.\" Id. at 1547.\n[28]See 10/30/96 Testimony of Ann Lott, Director of DHA's Section 8 Mobility Program, at III-43 (stating that DHA\nis able to use virtually every Section 8 voucher or certificate funded by HUD); see id. at III-65 (stating that DHA\ncould put to use an additional 1,500 Section 8 vouchers).\n[29]See id. at III-67 (stating that the mobility program could use more counselors).\n[30]See id. at III-57 (stating that higher fair market exception rents would assist in obtaining more Section 8\nhousing in predominantly white areas).\n[31] It is suggested in a brief that this criterion essentially restricts the areas available for new construction to\npredominantly white areas.\n[32] Moreover, the district court referred throughout his 8/25/97 Oral Opinion and 10/6/97 Written Opinion to the\ndanger of losing the funds already allocated to new construction because they could not be transferred to the\nSection 8 program. This may be true. Nonetheless, it does not justify the use of a race-conscious site selection\ncriterion.\n[33]See Billish v. City of Chicago, 989 F.2d 890, 893 (7th Cir.1993) (en banc); Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d\n790, 808 (1st Cir.1998) (\"Croson, in particular, leaves no doubt that only solid evidence will justify allowing race-\nconscious action...\"); id. (\"Our dissenting brother's valiant effort to read into Croson a broad discretion for\ngovernment entities purporting to ameliorate past discrimination strikes us as wishful thinking.\").\n[34]See, e.g., 8/25/97 Oral Opinion, at 28 (\"Even if this money [for new public housing construction] could be\nreprogrammed for Section 8, there would still be a need for the use of public housing in the desegregation plan.\nSection 8, although the preferred method, is not the only method. Indeed, there are members of this class who\nmade it evident, abundantly clear to this Court, that they did not trust Section 8, they would not use Section 8,\nand they should not be forced to use Section 8.\"); id. at p. 33 (\"I recognized then, as I do now, that although\nSection 8 certificates and vouchers may be the preferred method for most people, for many people there are\nrisks in Section 8 that not all class members would want to take. I declined to force those risks upon unwilling\nclass members.\").\n[35] DHA's Family Self-Sufficiency Program is a voluntary program that requires participants to, for instance, be\nemployed or attend school. The participants sign a five-year contract with DHA in which they agree to abide by\nthe program's regulations. In essence, the program is designed to make its participants self-sufficient by\n\nproviding them with \"upward mobility type assistance.\" 8/7/96 Deposition of Lori Moon, President & CEO of DHA,\nat 110.\n[36] As noted previously, HUD states in its brief to this court that it intends to fulfill its entire obligation regarding\nthe 3,205 additional units with Section 8 vouchers or certificates.\n[37] The third Paradise factor considers the flexibility and duration of relief. On balance, that factor is neutral in\nthis case.\n[38] According to the Walker plaintiffs' brief, at 11: \"There are 113 county census tracts with 63% or greater non-\nHispanic white population, 95 of which have a poverty population less than the county average. There are an\nadditional 20 tracts with a non-Hispanic white population between 50% and 63%. Only seven of these tracts have\na poverty rate less than the county's. There are an additional 16 tracts with a poverty population below the county\naverage but the non-Hispanic white population is less than 50%.\"\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Michael Jung (argued), Strasburger & Price, Dallas, TX, Jeffrey Alan Carter, McKool Smith, Austin, TX, for\nDefendant-Appellee.\nBefore HIGGINBOTHAM, SMITH and BENAVIDES, Circuit Judges.\nBENAVIDES, Circuit Judge:\nThis case concerns a lawsuit filed by Appellants, residents of a neighborhood in Dallas, Texas, against the Dallas\nHousing Authority (\"DHA\"), Appellee, to enjoin it from constructing public housing in their community. The\nresidents allege that DHA's decision to build on this particular property (\"the Hillcrest Site\") violates their\nFourteenth Amendment equal protection rights. The district court found no constitutional violation and permitted\nthe construction to go forward. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court's ruling.\nI. Background\nThe long saga of this case began in 1985 with a lawsuit filed on behalf of African-American plaintiffs against DHA.\n[1]\n It alleged, inter alia, that DHA engaged in systematic racial segregation through its construction and\nmaintenance of public housing in Dallas. In order to settle the claim that it consciously failed to locate public\nhousing in predominantly white neighborhoods, DHA agreed to a 1987 consent decree integrating Dallas public\nhousing. In 1994, after repeated breaches of the consent decree, DHA and the plaintiffs in that case negotiated a\nremedial order which was then imposed by the district court.\nThe remedial order required, inter alia, that DHA construct public housing in \"predominantly white areas\" to\nremedy past segregation. In compliance with the remedial order, DHA purchased two such sites in Dallas, the\nMcCallum Site and the Hillcrest Site. In 1996, homeowners in these areas sued to enjoin construction, arguing\n\nthat the remedial order violated their equal protection rights by requiring public housing in \"predominantly white\nareas.\" The district court denied the homeowners' request for an injunction.\nThe homeowners appealed that decision to this Court in 1999 and we reversed. See Walker, 169 F.3d 973.\nSpecifically, we held that a race-conscious remedy was not required to ameliorate segregative policies at DHA\nand thus the district court's order was not narrowly tailored. See id. at 985. Construction on the Hillcrest and\nMcCallum Sites was enjoined pending the district court's revision of the remedial order to comply with this Court's\nopinion. See id. at 988. Significantly, the opinion did \"not preclude the construction or acquisition of additional\npublic housing if sites [were] selected by means of nonracial criteria.\" Id.\n535 *535 In 2001, the district court modified the vacated remedial order to remove all references to the race of\nresidents in areas in which public housing could be constructed. The only racial classifications it contained were\nthose prohibiting DHA from discriminating against African-Americans in its housing policies. The order still\nrequired DHA to construct some public housing. DHA subsequently filed a motion to allow it to build on the\nHillcrest Site. Appellants again objected on equal protection grounds and, in December 2003, the district court\nheld a hearing on the motion. On May 18, 2004, the district court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of\nlaw, granting DHA's motion for approval of Hillcrest as a public housing site. It dismissed with prejudice\nAppellants' suit the following month. This appeal followed.\nII. Discussion\n[2]\nWe review the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. Ayers v.\nThompson, 358 F.3d 356, 368 (5th Cir.2004). \"A factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in\nthe light of the record read as a whole.\" United States v. Cluck, 143 F.3d 174, 180 (5th Cir.1998).\nAppellants claim that DHA's decision to construct public housing on the Hillcrest Site violates their equal\nprotection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. For cases like this, where the challenged governmental\naction is facially race-neutral, \"[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of\nthe Equal Protection Clause.\" Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50\nL.Ed.2d 450 (1977). Accord Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976)\n(stating that \"the invidious quality of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a\nracially discriminatory purpose\"). \"Once racial discrimination is shown to have been a `substantial' or `motivating'\nfactor,\" the burden shifts to those supporting the governmental action to show that the same course would have\nbeen pursued absent the discrimination. Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 228, 105 S.Ct. 1916, 85 L.Ed.2d\n222 (1985).\nThe district court found, inter alia:\"DHA's present intention to build public housing on the Hillcrest Site is not\nbased on any racial consideration\"; \"An intent to discriminate on the basis of race is not a substantial or\nmotivating factor in DHA's present intention to build public housing on the Hillcrest Site, and, in fact, was not a\nfactor at all\"; \"The Hillcrest Site meets HUD's and the court's requirements and is the best site available in the\nentire city\"; and \"DHA would have decided to build public housing on the Hillcrest Site absent the `predominantly\nwhite area' requirement.\" Additionally, it concluded that DHA's decision is not \"traceable\" to the prior\n536 impermissible race-conscious selection *536 criteria. In short, the district court found that DHA did not consider\nrace when deciding to build on the Hillcrest Site in 2001, and, regardless of any past improper considerations,\nDHA still would have built on the site because it is such an ideal location for public housing. Appellants fail to\nshow that the district court's conclusions are clearly erroneous. Although the parties contest specific factual\nmatters, the record, taken as a whole, does show that the district court's findings of fact are plausible. Thus, we\nfind no constitutional violation.\nAppellants also argue that DHA's actions relating to the Hillcrest Site run afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause its site selection can be traced to its prior unconstitutional activity. They contend that, regardless of\nDHA's current intentions, the decision to build public housing on the Hillcrest Site is unconstitutional as a matter\nof law. They base their argument on the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Fordice. 505 U.S. 717, 112\nS.Ct. 2727, 120 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992).\n\nThe Fordice Court found that Mississippi had not \"met its affirmative duty to dismantle its prior dual university\nsystem.\" Id. at 728, 112 S.Ct. 2727. Rather, the state university system continued to maintain separate\ninstitutions, each largely restricted to a single race, through \"practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system.\" \nId. Such government-fostered, educational segregation runs afoul of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483,\n74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), and its progeny. Id. at 727-28. Specifically, the Supreme Court concluded that\na state like Mississippi, which had maintained a de jure dual higher education system, \"does not discharge its\nconstitutional obligations until it eradicates policies and practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that\ncontinue to foster segregation.\" Id. at 728. \"If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its prior\nsystem that continue to have segregative effects ... and such policies are without sound educational justification\nand can be practicably eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled its prior\nsystem.\" Id. at 731. Appellants seek to analogize to Fordice by characterizing DHA's retention of and subsequent\ndecision to develop Hillcrest as a \"racially neutral\" policy \"animated by a discriminatory purpose.\" Id. at 731-32.\nIt is clear to us that DHA's current plan to build on the Hillcrest Site cannot be reasonably characterized as a\ncontinuation of an unconstitutional policy or practice such as that described in Fordice.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's decision.\n[1] For a detailed history of this matter, see our opinions in Walker v. City of Mesquite, 169 F.3d 973 (5th\nCir.1999), and Walker v. HUD, 912 F.2d 819 (5th Cir.1990).\n[2] Appellants ask us to apply a less deferential standard of review because of the constitutional nature of this\ncase. Contrary to Appellants' assertions, the proper standard of review for factual findings in equal protection\ncases like this is clear error. See Women's Med. Ctr. of Northwest Houston v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 419 (5th\nCir.2001); Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, 185 F.3d 477, 484 (5th Cir.1999). Appellants' contention that, because\nthe district court largely adopted the proposed findings of facts submitted by Appellees, we should not use the\nclear error standard is similarly unpersuasive. Even if proposed findings of fact are adopted by the trial court,\nabsent extraordinary circumstances, this Court continues to review them for clear error. See Anderson v.\nBessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 572, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); Marine Shale Processors Inc. v. EPA,\n81 F.3d 1371, 1386 (5th Cir.1996).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

GARZA, Circuit Judge:\nThis case arises from ongoing litigation between a class of plaintiffs (the \"Walker plaintiffs\") and the Dallas\nHousing Authority (DHA), the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the City\nof Dallas (collectively, \"the defendants\"). In the primary litigation, the defendants were found liable for\nunconstitutional racial discrimination and segregation in Dallas's public housing programs. The result was a\nremedial order from the district court that, in relevant part, ordered DHA to construct or acquire public housing\nprojects in \"predominantly white\" neighborhoods.\nTwo homeowners and their homeowners' associations (collectively, the \"Homeowners\") then sued for declaratory\nand injunctive relief to prevent construction of these new projects adjacent to their neighborhoods. The\nHomeowners challenged the remedial order as unconstitutional. In a separate action, the Walker plaintiffs sought\ndeclaratory relief that the remedial order was constitutional. The district court found against the Homeowners and\nfor the Walker plaintiffs in the two actions, respectively. The Homeowners appealed, and we partially vacated the\nremedial order, reversed the declaratory judgment, and remanded for revision of the order. A more thorough\nrecitation of the facts and issues of this complicated case can be found in our decision, Walker v. City of\nMesquite, 169 F.3d 973 (5th Cir.1999).\n249 *249 Upon remand, the district court modified the remedial order to comply with our instructions. The\nHomeowners next sought attorney's fees in excess of a quarter of a million dollars from the DHA under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1988. The district court denied fees, holding that (1) the Homeowners were not a \"prevailing party\" within the\nmeaning of § 1988; (2) special circumstances existed which made it unjust to impose fees upon the DHA; and (3)\n\nthe Homeowners' fee request had not been appropriately substantiated. See Walker v. HUD, No. 3-85-CV-1210-\nR, 3-96-CV-1866-R, 2001 WL 1148109 (N.D.Tex. Sept.18, 2001). The propriety of § 1988 attorney's fees for the\nHomeowners is the primary issue in this appeal.\nSection 1988 provides in relevant part: \"In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [§ 1983], the court,\nin its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part\nof the costs.\" A litigant is not eligible for attorney's fees unless it is a \"prevailing party.\" Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S.\n755, 759, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987). In Hewitt, the Supreme Court held that, at a minimum, a\nplaintiff must receive \"some relief on the merits of his claim\" in order to prevail. Id. at 760, 107 S.Ct. 2672. Texas\nState Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Independent School District, 489 U.S. 782, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866\n(1989), reaffirmed the floor set in Hewitt and noted that the plaintiff must be able to point to \"a resolution of the\ndispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant.\" Id. at 791-92, 107 S.Ct. 2672. In\nfact, Texas State Teachers characterized the \"touchstone\" of the prevailing party inquiry as whether there was a\n\"material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.\" Id. at 792-93, 109 S.Ct. 1486.\nThree years later, the Court returned to this issue in Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d\n494 (1992). Farrar provided one of the clearest formulations of the prevailing party jurisprudence. To qualify as a\nprevailing party, the plaintiff must (1) obtain actual relief, such as an enforceable judgment or a consent decree;\n(2) that materially alters the legal relationship between the parties; and (3) modifies the defendant's behavior in a\nway that directly benefits the plaintiff at the time of the judgment or settlement. Id. at 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566. Most\nrecently, in Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human\nResources, 532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), the Court reaffirmed that both judgments on\nthe merits and settlement agreements enforced through consent decrees were sufficient to create a prevailing\nparty. Id. at 604, 121 S.Ct. 1835. Again, the Court stated that the awarded relief for which fees were sought must\nmaterially alter the \"legal relationship of the parties.\" Id. (citing Texas State Teachers, 489 U.S. at 792-93, 109\nS.Ct. 1486).\nIn this case, the Homeowners sought declaratory relief, alleging the remedial order was unconstitutional because\nit included race-based distinctions and was not narrowly tailored. They also sought a temporary restraining order,\na preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction to prevent the DHA from purchasing and/or constructing\npublic housing on the disputed sites. The district court denied the Homeowners the relief they sought and, in\nresponse to the Walker plaintiffs' suit, declared the remedial order constitutional. On appeal, we partially vacated\nthe district court's remedial order, reversed the declaratory judgment, and stayed the construction of the housing\n250 projects until the district court revised the order. Our opinion *250 also included a detailed discussion of how the\nremedial order should be reformulated. Specifically, we held that the race-based portion of the order was\nunconstitutional because \"there are promising, non-racially discriminatory ways to continue desegregating public\nhousing in Dallas.\" Walker, 169 F.3d at 987. Upon remand, the Walker plaintiffs proposed detailed modifications\nto the remedial order, and the district court ultimately vacated the provisions of the order that contained the\n\"predominantly white\" requirement. In short, the Homeowners achieved exactly the outcome they desired. Thus,\nthe district court erred when it held that the Homeowners were not a prevailing party.\nThe DHA argues that the Homeowners cannot be a prevailing party because our holding was not \"judicial relief\"\nfor the purposes of § 1988. We find this argument to be without merit. Although the permanent injunction sought\nby the Homeowners was never granted, this court held, as a matter of law, that the remedial order was\nunconstitutional for precisely the reasons argued by the Homeowners in their request for declaratory relief. On its\nface, our ruling entitled the Homeowners to relief. Thus, the district court's ultimate vacation of the offending\nprovisions of the order is the functional equivalent of an enforceable judgment for the Homeowners and against\n[1]\nthe DHA.  As to the second and third requirements of the prevailing party test, there can be no doubt that the\nHomeowners' suit both materially altered the legal relationship between the DHA and the Homeowners and\ndirectly benefitted the Homeowners at the time of the judgment. The Homeowners suit was not only a \"substantial\nfactor\" in achieving reformation of the unconstitutional order, it was arguably the only factor. See Foreman v.\nDallas County, 193 F.3d 314, 321 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted).\n251 Notwithstanding the Homeowners' status as a prevailing party, attorney's *251 fees should not be awarded if\n\"special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S.Ct.\n\n1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (citation omitted); Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964,\n19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968). The district court adopted the magistrate judge's conclusions that the DHA should not be\nliable for fees because it was faced with the unattractive choice of either violating the district court's remedial\norder or obeying the order and exposing itself to potential liability for the fees and expenses of the Homeowners. \nWalker v. HUD, 2001 WL 1148109, at *2-3. We have repeatedly held that a state actor's good faith compliance\nwith an official or legal requirement that is unconstitutional is not a special circumstance that justifies the denial of\nattorney's fees. See Espino v. Besteiro, 708 F.2d 1002, 1005-06 (5th Cir.1983); Riddell v. Nat'l Democratic Party,\n624 F.2d 539, 545-46 (5th Cir.1980); Johnson v. Mississippi, 606 F.2d 635, 637 (5th Cir.1979). Additionally, the\nDHA did not litigate the unconstitutional terms of the remedial order; it instead chose not to contest the Walker\nplaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. See Walker, 169 F.3d at 977. Given the DHA's ongoing involvement in\nthis litigation, it seems particularly inappropriate to deny the Homeowners attorney's fees because the DHA\n[2]\nacquiesced to a remedy that infringed upon the Homeowners' rights.  Thus, the special circumstances cited by\nthe district court in this case are insufficient to justify the denial of an award of attorney's fees.\nFinally, the district court found that the Homeowners' fee request should be denied because they failed to\nsubstantiate their request under well-established principles. Generally, the magistrate judge found, and the\ndistrict court agreed, that the Homeowners' attorneys did not exercise \"billing judgment\" because they did not\ndocument both the hours charged and the hours written off and they included non-legal hours in their\nsubmissions, including time billed for drafting press releases and preparing for a media interview. Walker v. HUD,\n2001 WL 1148109, at *3-4. In addition, the Homeowners were found to have requested fees for time spent on\nissues that were not pursued and time spent exclusively on responding to motions and issues raised by the\nWalker plaintiffs, and not by the DHA.\nThe district court is correct that \"[t]he plaintiffs are charged with the burden of showing the reasonableness of the\nhours they bill and, accordingly, are charged with proving that they exercised billing judgment.\" Walker v. HUD,\n99 F.3d 761, 770 (5th Cir.1996) (dealing with an earlier stage of this same litigation that related to the Walker\nplaintiffs' request for § 1988 fees from the defendants). If there is no evidence of billing judgment, however, then\nthe proper remedy is not a denial of fees, but a reduction of \"the hours awarded by a percentage intended to\nsubstitute for the exercise of billing judgment.\" Id. Likewise, the Homeowners are not entitled to fees for issues on\nwhich they did not prevail, and they cannot have prevailed on issues they did not pursue. Id. at 769.\n252 Although the district court found the Homeowners' marshaling of evidence *252 \"shoddy,\" it also noted that\nresources were \"too scarce\" to warrant the amount of time it would take to determine the appropriate fee award.\nAs we held in League of United Latin American Citizens #4552 (LULAC) v. Roscoe Independent School District,\n119 F.3d 1228 (5th Cir.1997), \"mere recitation that there is insufficient documentation cannot insulate\" the district\ncourt's analysis from our review. Id. at 1233. The bills submitted by the Homeowners include the date of each\n[3]\nhour spent and the time spent to the tenth of an hour.  In addition, a majority of the entries include a \"short but\nthorough description of the services rendered\" 00 thus, these submissions appear to meet the threshold standard\n97\nwe set in LULAC. Id. Of course, not every entry is equally specific, and the district court has broad discretion to\n[4]\nexclude or reduce the entries that are vague. Id. We also ruled in LULAC that the district court must eliminate\nexcessive or duplicative time. Id. at 1232. On remand, the district court should analyze the evidence submitted by\nthe Homeowners and determine an appropriate fee award, keeping in mind the criteria set out in LULAC. As a\nfinal matter, we note that the Homeowners are also entitled to reasonable attorney's fees for the time devoted to\nthis appeal. Id. at 1236. Whether to allow the Homeowners to amend their prior fee application to comply with \nLULAC is left to the discretion of the district court.\nFor the forgoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court's findings that the Homeowners were not a prevailing\nparty within the meaning of § 1988 and that special circumstances existed that justified the denial of attorney's\nfees, and we REMAND for a determination of attorney's fees consistent with this opinion.\nHUDSPETH, District Judge, dissenting:\nBecause I believe that the distinguished district judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that the Appellants\nwere not \"prevailing parties\" entitled to an award of attorney's fees under § 1988, I respectfully dissent.\n\nFrom the very beginning of their involvement in this litigation until now, the real objective of the Homeowners has\nbeen to prevent the Dallas Housing Authority from constructing new public housing units on land adjacent to the\ntheir neighborhoods. They have not achieved that objective. When this Court decided the previous appeal in\n1999, it did stay construction at the sites adjacent to the Homeowners' neighborhoods pending further\nproceedings in the district court. Walker v. City of Mesquite, Texas, 169 F.3d at 988. However, that stay has long\nsince expired, and neither the district court nor this Court has enjoined construction of public housing units on\nthose specific sites. Indeed, the Dallas Housing Authority is still considering building new public housing units on\nthose sites, basing the decision to build there upon criteria which the Authority asserts are race-neutral. In my\nview, this is an example of what the Supreme Court meant when it stated that \"Of itself, `the moral satisfaction\n253 [that] results from any favorable statement of law' cannot bestow *253 prevailing party status.\" Farrar v. Hobby,\n506 U.S. at 112, 113 S.Ct. 566; Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. at 762, 107 S.Ct. 2672. In this case, the Homeowners\nhave not \"prevailed\", i.e., attained their litigation objectives, in any material or realistic way. Therefore, I would\nhold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Homeowners' application for attorney's fees,\nand would affirm the decision below.\n[*] District Judge of the Western District of Texas, sitting by designation.\n[1] The Homeowners did not simply achieve a favorable statement of the law or a temporary stay, as suggested\nby the DHA in its brief. This court's finding that the remedial order was unconstitutional, and the district court's\nlater modification of that order to comply with our ruling is distinguishable from the cases cited by the DHA. In \nHewitt, the prisoner plaintiff had only obtained an \"interlocutory ruling that his complaint should not have been\ndismissed for failure to state a constitutional claim.\" 482 U.S. at 760, 107 S.Ct. 2672. Upon remand, the district\ncourt again granted summary judgment for the defendants because they were found to have qualified immunity.\nThe bureau of corrections ultimately revised its regulations to respond to some of the constitutional issues raised\nby the prisoner, but the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff's failure to achieve either an award of damages or\nthe injunctive and declaratory relief he sought did not render him a prevailing party. Id.; see also Buckhannon,\n532 U.S. at 605-10, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (rejecting the \"catalyst theory\" that a suit which ultimately results in the\namendment of a law or regulation through non-judicial channels is enough to render a party \"prevailing\" within the\nmeaning of § 1988). The DHA next cites Buckhannon for the proposition that a party has not prevailed if it only\nsecures the reversal of a directed verdict or a pronouncement that the defendant violated the Constitution \nunaccompanied by judicial relief. 532 U.S. at 605-06, 121 S.Ct. 1835. In fact, Buckhannon does indicate that fees\nare only appropriate when the plaintiff has received a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree. \nId. As explained above, however, the Homeowners not only secured the reversal of the declaratory judgment but\nalso achieved a partial vacation of the remedial order and the ultimate revision of that order in the district court.\nThus, our pronouncement on the constitutionality of the order was accompanied by the district court's \"judicial\nrelief\" modifying the order. See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 606, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (citation omitted) (emphasis in \nBuckhannon); see also Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 757, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980) (per\ncuriam) (holding that a party can prevail on the merits of his claims in the trial court or on appeal).\n[2] The district court also held that, if the DHA was liable under § 1988, the fees recoverable by the Homeowners\nshould be reduced pro rata because the Walker plaintiffs were also responsible for the remedial order. Walker v.\nHUD, 2001 WL 1148109, at *3. We note that the Walker plaintiffs cannot be jointly and severally liable for\nattorney's fees with the DHA because they are not state actors under § 1983 and because the Homeowners did\nnot seek any relief from the Walker plaintiffs.\n[3] At this point, we pause to emphasize that the bills presented by the Homeowners are in fact the same bills the\nHomeowners reviewed and paid during the litigation.\n[4] For example, at least one invoice includes such summary descriptions as \"research regarding\" and \"research\nlegal issues.\" These general descriptions are almost identical to the entry we found vague in LULAC.119 F.3d at\n1233. In that case, we held that such vague entries could be reduced or eliminated by the district court. Id.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Concluding that Baylor and Hogg lack the requisite standing to appeal the consent\ndecree in this class action, we dismiss.\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn June 25, 1985, plaintiff Debra Walker, a black woman eligible for federal low income housing assistance, filed\nthe instant suit against the City of Mesquite, Texas, alleging that the City had failed to enter into a cooperation\nagreement with the Dallas Housing Authority (DHA) in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1982, 1983 and 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604. Walker claimed that the City's refusal in this regard made subsidized rental housing in Mesquite\nunavailable to her on the basis of her race. Ultimately, Walker amended her complaint to assert a class action.\nSeven named plaintiffs, all black women eligible for federal housing assistance, were also added to the original\ncomplaint. Further, the DHA, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and\nseven other suburban cities in the Dallas area were named as defendants. The district court, however,\nsubsequently dismissed the complaints against the defendant cities.\nThereafter, on November 6, 1986, the named parties sought approval by the district court of a proposed\nsettlement reached by the parties in the form of a consent decree. After receiving the request of the parties for\napproval of the proposed decree, the district court ordered that the DHA distribute to putative class members\nnotice of the proposed settlement and notice of a December 12, 1986, fairness hearing on that settlement. At the\n1073 fairness *1073 hearing on December 12, 1986, the district court considered oral testimony and documentary\nexhibits relating to the settlement. The district court subsequently approved the consent decree and on January\n20, 1987, signed the decree and entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law. In the January 20 decree, the\ndistrict court also certified as a plaintiff class all black persons who were then, or who, during the pendency of the\n\ndecree, became either \"(a) residents of a DHA owned or managed project or (b) participants in the DHA Section 8\nExisting Housing Program.\"\nFollowing the entry of the January 20 consent decree by the district court, objectors Baylor and Hogg, members\nof the certified class, but not named plaintiffs, filed a pro se notice of appeal on February 19, 1987, from the\ndistrict court's January 20 decree. Thereafter, Baylor and Hogg filed a motion to intervene in the district court for\nthe purpose of challenging the January 20 consent decree. The district court denied the motion to intervene and\nsignificantly, Baylor and Hogg did not seek to appeal the denial of that motion. We now turn to the instant appeal.\nII. DISCUSSION\nAppellees DHA, HUD, and the named plaintiffs all challenge the standing of Baylor and Hogg to appeal the\nJanuary 20 consent decree. Further, DHA seeks damages and double costs from Baylor and Hogg pursuant to\nFed.R.App.P. 38 on the basis that Baylor and Hogg filed a frivolous appeal. For the reasons set forth below, we\nagree that Baylor and Hogg lack standing to challenge the January 20 consent decree, but we decline to impose\nsanctions under Rule 38.\nIn Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 576 F.2d 1157 (5th Cir.1978),cert. denied,439 U.S. 1115, 99 S.Ct.\n1020, 59 L.Ed.2d 74 (1979), this Court recognized that distinctive problems may be presented where the named\nplaintiffs in a class action and the class attorney decide not to appeal a final judgment in a class action. 576 F.2d\nat 1178 n. 19. The Pettway Court then proceeded to note that \"members of the class may certainly pursue relief\nin a collateral proceeding\" but then expressly declined to resolve \"[w]hether, and how, a direct appeal may be\ntaken absent the participation of the original named plaintiffs, or the participation of both the named plaintiffs and\nthe class attorney.\" Id. Since Pettway, this Court has not yet spoken dispositively to the above issue; however, the\nEleventh Circuit has so spoken in Guthrie v. Evans, 815 F.2d 626 (11th Cir.1987), concluding that a nonnamed\nclass member of a certified class may not appeal the final judgment in a class action. Persuaded that the\nreasoning employed by the Eleventh Circuit in Guthrie is correct, we now join in the above conclusion.\nIn Guthrie, the Eleventh Circuit stated three reasons in support of its holding that individual, nonnamed class\nmembers do not have standing to appeal a final judgment binding on the class members.\nFirst, such individuals cannot represent the class absent the procedures provided for in Rule 23 of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Second, class members who disagree with a course of a\nclass action have available adequate procedures through which their individual interests can be\nprotected. Third, class actions could become unmanageable and non-productive if each member\ncould individually decide to appeal.\nGuthrie, 815 F.2d at 628. While recognizing the importance of all of the above three reasons outlined by the \nGuthrie court for concluding that individual, nonnamed class members do not possess standing to appeal the\nfinal judgment in a class action, we find particularly significant the second proferred justification for that\nconclusion which relates to the collateral avenues of relief which are available to nonnamed class members to\nprotect their interests. Specifically, those collateral avenues of relief include the filing of a motion to intervene in\nthe district court as a matter of right pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See\nFed.R.Civ.P. 24, Advisory Committee Notes; Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 710 F.2d 1040, 1043-44 (5th Cir.1983).\n1074 \"Intervention is a means whereby class members can monitor the representation *1074 of their rights.\" Guthrie,\n815 F.2d at 628. Further, an order denying a motion to intervene is a final appealable order. Id. In the instant\ncase, Baylor and Hogg did in fact file a motion to intervene in the class action; however, the motion to intervene\nwas filed subsequent to the entry of the January 20 consent decree. Despite the untimely filing of the motion, the\ndistrict court addressed the merits of that motion and rejected the contention of Baylor and Hogg that the\nrepresentation of class members in the instant proceedings was inadequate. Importantly, Baylor and Hogg did\nnot appeal the denial by the district court of their motion to intervene.\nAn additional method of collateral attack available to individual, nonnamed class members to protect their\ninterests is the filing of a separate suit in the district court challenging the adequacy of class representation. \nGonzales v. Cassidy, 474 F.2d 67 (5th Cir.1973). We note in this regard that the filing of such a separate suit\n\nremains a viable option to the individual, nonnamed class members such as Baylor and Hogg in the instant action\nshould such members question the adequacy of class representation.\nFurther, our conclusion today that nonnamed class members do not have standing to appeal the final judgment in\na class action is supported by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S. ___, 108\nS.Ct. 586, 98 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988). In Marino, the Supreme Court recognized the general rule that only parties to a\nlawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment. Marino, 108 S.Ct. at 587. In \nMarino, the Supreme Court concluded that individuals who were nonparties and who chose not to intervene in a\nclass action could not later appeal the final judgment in that action. Noting that the Court of Appeals in that case\nsuggested that there may be exceptions to the general rule of nonappealability by nonparties such as when the\nnonparty has an interest that is affected by the trial court's judgment, the Supreme Court nevertheless concluded\nthat the better practice is for a nonparty to seek intervention for purposes of appeal. Id. In so concluding, the\nSupreme Court recognized that the denials of such motions to intervene are, of course, appealable. Id.\nSimilar to the conclusions reached in Marino and Guthrie, we conclude that the better practice in the instant case\nis for nonnamed class members to file a motion to intervene and then, upon the denial of that motion, appeal to\nthis Court. A contrary rule would result in the frustration of the purpose behind class litigation. Specifically, as\nrecognized by the Eleventh Circuit in Guthrie,\"[i]f each class member could appeal individually, the litigation could\n[1]\nbecome unwieldly,\" unmanageable, and nonproductive. Guthrie, 815 F.2d at 629.  In the instant case, objectors\nBaylor and Hogg could have intervened in the class action prior to the entry of the consent decree on January 20.\nIndeed, notice of the proposed settlement was distributed to all putative class members and a fairness hearing on\nthe proposed settlement was conducted by the district court. Further, Baylor and Hogg did file a motion to\nintervene, albeit untimely, pursuant to which the district court addressed the merits of the claims of Baylor and\n1075 Hogg as to the adequacy of class representation. Baylor and Hogg, however, did not seek to appeal *1075 the\ndenial of the motion to intervene. Thus, we are constrained to dismiss the instant appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In\ndoing so, we expressly recognize the fact that nonnamed class members may still challenge the adequacy of\nclass representation in the instant suit by filing a separate lawsuit for that purpose in the district court.\nWe next address the request by DHA for appellate sanctions pursuant to Rule 38. In making this request, DHA\npoints to what it perceives to be attacks by Baylor and Hogg on the consent decree which are frivolous and\nwholly devoid of merit. In ruling on the request by DHA, we note that the imposition of sanctions in civil rights\nactions could possibly result in the deterrence of the filing of future meritorious claims by civil rights plaintiffs.\nAfter reviewing the record we conclude that the instant appeal does not present facts sufficient to warrant the\nimposition of appellate sanctions. For this reason, the request for appellate sanctions is denied.\nDISMISSED.\n[1] In concluding that individual, nonnamed class members do not have standing to appeal the final judgment in a\nclass action, we recognize that two previous Fifth Circuit cases, United States v. Chagra, 701 F.2d 354 (5th\nCir.1983), and Roper v. Consurve, Inc., 578 F.2d 1106 (5th Cir.1978),aff'd,445 U.S. 326, 100 S.Ct. 1166, 63\nL.Ed.2d 427 (1980), have allowed individuals who are not named parties to the dispute to appeal. In Chagra,\nhowever, the Court was addressing the specific question of whether or not the media could appeal the granting of\na criminal defendant's motion to close his bail hearing. Therefore, in Chagra, the policy considerations present in\nclass action litigation were not at issue; thus, the unique situation in Chagra cannot serve as precedent in the\ninstant case to allow individual, nonnamed class members to appeal a final judgment in a class action. \nIn Roper, the appellants were seeking to appeal the denial of a class certification. The appeal of an order denying\ncertification of a class and the appeal of a final judgment in a class action are dissimilar; therefore the reasoning\nin Roper is not applicable to the instant case.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

JONES, Circuit Judge.* \n \n*1 The issue presented to this court is whether Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a district court to \nenter findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the vacation of a consent decree.1 Rule 52(a) declares “[i]n all actions \ntried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its \nconclusions of law thereon ....“ Rule 52(a) further provides that “in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court \nshall similarly set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its actions.” These \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law provide the basis for appellate review. Westwego Citizens for Better Gov’t v. City of \nWestwego, 872 F.2d 1201, 1203 (5th Cir.1989). \n  \nThe district court’s vacation of the consent decree, in place since 1987, can only be supported by specific findings of fact \njustifying the vacation and conclusions of law. No such findings or conclusions were made. The only explanation or \njustification for vacating the consent decree given by the district court is the statement from the bench that “the people in \nWest Dallas have not received what DHA bargained for, not received what the Plaintiffs bargained for.” Such a conclusory \ndeclaration is insufficient under Rule 52(a). This court has once previously remanded this case to the district court for further \nfindings of fact. Walker II, 912 F.2d at 823. Because we are unable to perform any meaningful review of this case with \nvirtually no findings of fact or conclusions of law to review, we again remand this case to the district court to make all \nnecessary findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the vacation. See Westwego, 872 F .2d at 1204. \n  \nParallel Citations \n1994 WL 574708 (C.A.5 (Tex.)) \nFootnotes \n \n*  Local Rule 47.5 provides: “The publication of opinions that have no precedential value and merely decide particular cases on the \n  basis of well-settled principles of law imposes needless expense on the public and burdens on the legal profession.” Pursuant to \nthat Rule, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published. \n \n1  Respondent’s contention that this court does not have jurisdiction over this appeal is without merit. As we previously held in \n  Walker v. U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Dev., 912 F.2d 819, 828 (5th Cir.1990) (hereinafter “Walker II”), a judicial \nmodification of a consent decree confers appellate jurisdiction under section 1292(a)(1) to review the modification. Vacation of a \nconsent decree likewise confers appellate jurisdiction. \n  1 \n \n\nWalker v. City of Mesquite, 38 F.3d 569 (1994)   \n \n \n \n \n \n  2 \n ",

 in  it,  Representative  Frost  stated:  “I  have  the  highest  regard  for  the  Court  ...  but  given  the  Court’s  Order,  I  have  no  choice  \n  \nbut  to  seek  a  legislative  remedy  to  prevent  the  demolition  in  West  Dallas.”  \n  \n31   Cong.Rec.-­‐House,  pp.  7743–7744,  7752–7753,  7776–7778  (Sept.  22,  1987).  \n  \n  \n32   The   plaintiffs   make   several   other   attacks   upon   the   Frost   Amendment.   First,   they   claim   that   it   was   repealed   by   the  \nAnti–Demolition  Statute;  this  Court  disagrees  because,  from  the  legislative  history,  it  seems  clear  that  the  understanding  of  the  \n  \nHouse  members  was  that  the  provision  for  “1–for–1  replacements  of  units  of  public  housing”  under  the  Anti–Demolition  Statute  \n“would  not  be  permitted  to  be  used  in  West  Dallas”  because  of  the  Frost  Amendment.  See  Cong.Rec.-­‐House,  p.  7753  (Sept.  22,  \n1987)  (Remarks  of  Rep.  Bartlett).  Second,  they  argue  that  the  Frost  Amendment  is  unconstitutional  because  it  would,  in  this  case,  \nhelp  perpetuate  racial  segregation  in  public  housing;  this  Court  again  disagrees—not  with  the  claim  that  racial  segregation  in  \npublic  housing  in  Dallas  would  be  perpetuated  by  the  Frost  Amendment—but  because  the  House  debates  clearly  indicate  that  the  \nsupporters  of  the  Frost  Amendment  were  sincere,  and  were  not  acting  for  discriminatory  reasons,  in  trying  to  prevent  demolition  \nof  any  public  housing  in  Dallas  (a  decision  reached  without  any  consideration  of  the  conflicting  interests  presented  to  this  Court  \nby  the  testimony  and  exhibits  at  the  Dec.  12,  1986  fairness  hearing).  \n  \n33   For  example,  §  1437p  would  obviously  apply  in  this  case  to  the  demolition  of  any  units  at  West  Dallas  besides  those  covered  by  \nthe  1435  units  of  §  8  certificates  and  vouchers  and  of  new  LRPH  units  which  HUD  has  issued  to  DHA.  \n  \n  \n34   This  Court  is  aware  that  Judge  Diamond,  in  Tillman  v.  Pittsburgh  Housing  Authority,  CA  No.  88–0311  (W.D.Pa.),  issued  a  bench  \nruling  on  Feb.  17,  1988,  that  the  Anti–Demolition  Statute  does  not  apply  retroactively.  See  April  21  and  Dec.  21,  1988  letters  to  \n  \nthis  Court  from  the  HUD  attorneys.  However,  the  demolition  involved  in  that  case  had  already  received  final  approval  and  was  \nscheduled  for  a  date  less  than  a  month  from  the  Feb.  17,  1988  hearing.  Therefore,  it  would  have  been  “manifestly  unjust”  to  \n   13  \n  \n\nWalker  v.  U.S.  Dept.  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  734  F.Supp.  1272  (1989)     \n  \n  \napply  §  1437p  in  that  case;  indeed,  Judge  Diamond  stated:  “It  would  be  absurd  and  unreasonable  to  apply  the  requirements  of  \nnew  law  [effective  Feb.  5,  1988]  to  demolitions  that  have  already  been  commenced  in  compliance  with  the  old  law.”  \n  \n35   Plaintiffs’  Response  to  HUD’s  6D  Motion,  pp.  2–3  (Oct.  28,  1988).  \n  \n  \n36   See,  e.g.,  Dec.  21,  1987  Hearing:  Tr.  104  (“When  I  approved  that  Consent  Decree,  [everybody  heard  me  say]  that  if  everybody  in  \nWest  Dallas  wanted  to  stay  there  they  could  do  so  and  those  units  were  not  going  to  be  torn  down”);  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Tr.  \n  \n170  (DHA  attorney  referring  to  “this  Court’s  repeated  statement  that  nothing  will  be  demolished  without  your  specific  expressed  \nauthority”);  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Tr.  195–197  (Court’s  explanation  of  this  to  the  Mayor  of  Dallas).  \n  \n37   The  other  parties  certainly  understood  that  Court  approval  was  required  for  any  demolition  of  public  housing.  For  example,  on  \nFeb.  24,  1987,  DHA  requested  approval  for  the  demolition  of  two  buildings  at  Edgar  Ward  (with  12  units).  And,  by  letter  dated  \n  \nMay  1,  1987,  the  plaintiffs  objected  to  this  demolition.  \n  \n38   Because  of  this  holding,  it  is  unnecessary  to  consider  the  plaintiffs’  objections  to  HUD’s  approval  of  the  demolition  plan  on  the  \ngrounds  that  there  was  no  proper  environmental  impact  statement  and  no  proper  certification  of  the  demolition  plan  by  the  City  \n  \nof  Dallas.  \n  \n39   HUD  correctly  argues  that  if  it  “had  known  that  [HUD]  could  not  expect  demolition  of  one  West  Dallas  unit  for  each  [§  8]  unit  it  \nprovided,  it  might  well  have  chosen  to  allocate  many  of  those  units  to  other  housing  authorities  with  needs  as  acute  as  those  of  \n  \nDHA.”  \n  \n40   See  Consent  Decree,  6(C)  and  (D).  Section  6(C)  provides:  “Actual  demolition  of  any  unit  shall  not  start,  however,  until  plaintiffs  \nand  DHA  agree  that  a  one-­‐for-­‐one  replacement  of  such  unit  can  be  reasonably  expected  to  be  received  from  future  allocations  of  \n  \nfunds.”  \n  \n41   DHA  First  Annual  Report,  Exh.  C  (Jan.  20,  1988).  \n  \n  \n42   Of  course,  those  class  members  who  located  in  non-­‐minority  areas  with  §  8  vouchers  only  by  paying  substantially  higher  rents  are  \nentitled  to  retroactive  reimbursement  for  the  additional  amounts  they  paid.  See  Walker  I,  p.  1240  at  fn.  33.  \n  \n  \n43   There  is  one  final  problem—which,  of  course,  occurs  in  the  bedrooms.  The  Consent  Decree  requires  that  each  unit  to  be  \ndemolished  must  be  replaced  on  a  “one-­‐for-­‐one”  basis.  As  the  plaintiffs  contend,  this  does  not  permit  HUD  and  DHA  to  replace  \n  \ntwo-­‐bedroom  units  with  one-­‐bedroom  §  8  units.  Therefore,  the  allocation  of  §  8  assistance  by  HUD  was  deficient  by  129  \ntwo-­‐bedroom  units—and  the  surplus  of  one-­‐bedroom  units  may  not  be  used  to  cure  this  deficiency.  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.  \nExhs.  9–11.  The  Court  does  not  have  sufficient  evidence  to  determine  whether  this  problem  will  have  any  affect  upon  the  \nnumber  of  West  Dallas  units  that  are  subject  to  demolition  under  this  opinion.  \n  \n  \n \n  \n     \n  \n \n  \n   14  \n  ",

CIVIL ACTION NO. \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT  3:85-CV-1210-R \nOF HOUSING AND URBAN \nDEVELOPMENT et al.,  CLASS ACTION \nDefendants. \nAGREED FINAL JUDGMENT \n1. Debra Walker et al. (collectively referred to as \"plaintiffs\") and The Housing Authority \nofthe City of Dallas, Texas (\"DHA\"), one of the Defendants herein, consent to the entry of this \nAgreed Final Judgment. The Court finds that, as required by Federal Rule of Procedure 23, th~s \nsettlement is fair, reasonable and adequate and that class members were given notice of the \nsettlement and hearing in a reasonable manner. \n2. The remedial actions already successfully completed by DHA during the course of the \ncase, the entry of the Agreed Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion to Name ICP Housing Fund \nAdministrator, and the successful completion of the obligations contained in this judgment \nconstitute the DHA actions necessary for it to have taken all steps practical to eliminate the \nvestiges ofthe prior racial segregation in DHA's public housing and Section 8 programs. Upon \ncompletion of the obligations set out in paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19, and 20, DHA shall \nhave attained complete unitary status. \n3.

Any and all pending \nmotions of any party are denied with prejudice as to any relief requested in those motions that is \nnot granted in this Agreed Final Judgment. Upon completion of the obligations set out in this \nAgreed Final Judgment or upon other appropriate grounds, DHA shall be entitled to a final \ndismissal of this case. The case can be dismissed before the expiration of the 15 year obligation \nin paragraph 13 if the dismissal contains a provision maintaining DHA's obligations under \nparagraph 13 for the remainder of the 15 year term. \n5. DHA is released from the prior judicial supervision of its operations and programs \nexcept to the limited extent set out in this Agreed Final Judgment. \n6. Specifically, judicial supervision of the following areas ofDHA's operations shall be \nand is terminated because DHA has taken the actions necessary and used the resources available \nto eradicate the vestiges ofDHA's prior racial segregation in connection with these areas of \nDHA's operation: \na. DHA's tenant selection and assignment process; \nb. DHA's Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, or such other program as may be \nsubstituted therefore by the United States Congress or by the United States Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"), except for DHA's implementation of the April26, \n2001 Order Approving Plan For DHA's Implementation ofHUD Settlement as DHA's Section 8 \nSubstitution Plan; \nc.

DHA's revitalization, maintenance, repair, and improvement operations in its Public \nHousing programs. As used in this Agreed Final Judgment \"Public Housing\" includes \nconventional Section 9 public housing, Section 8 project-based housing assistance and all other \nforms of housing assistance that are project-based rather than tenant-based to the extent the \nprogram provides housing on terms substantially equivalent to the terms on which conventional \nSection 9 public housing is available.  The term \"Public Housing\" shall also include low-income \nhousing developed under the HOPE VI grant program administered by HUD and similar \nprograms for the development and/or revitalization of low-income housing. \n7.

Each resident household of these \n119 Section 8 Project Based units shall be issued a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher, if, at any \ntime after the initial lease term, the resident household gives DHA written notice requesting the \nissuance of the voucher. DHA shall give each resident household written notice of this right at \nthe time of signing the initial lease. \n14. With the approval of the additional units and the modification of paragraph C. of the \nmodified site selection order in paragraph 13 above, DHA has developed 362 of the 399 \npreviously allocated public housing units that were the subject of~ C. of the March 29, 2001 \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' March 15, 2001 Amended Motion for a Revised Remedial Order for \nSite Selection and Public Housing Development in sites and locations that meet the requirements \nof that Order and that have been approved by the Court.

HUD  may  provide  the \nfunding  for  the  remainder  of  the  Vouchers  at  such  rate  as \nHUD,  in  its sole  discretion,  deems  appropriate. \n4.  As  an administrative matter,  all  reservations  of  units \npursuant  to  this  order will  be  in addition  to  the  11,526 \nunits  that  constitute DHA's  adjusted baseline  number  of \nunits  as  of  December  31,  2000,  apart  from  the  1,605  units \npreviously  reserved  for  DHA  pursuant  to  the  Modified \nRemedial  Order  in  this  case  (for a  total  baseline  of  13,131 \nunits).  Reservation  of  3,205  units  pursuant  to  this  order \nwill  not  reduce  the  reservation of  additional  Bection  8 \nunits  that  otherwise  would  be  made  to  DHA.  Funding  for  the \nVouchers  shall  be  renewed  in accordance  applicable  law  and \nregulations  for  renewal  of  expiring consolidated ACC  funding \nincrements,  pursuant  to  24  C.F.R.  §  982.102.  Pursuant  to \nHUD's  current  regulations,  the  Vouchers  funded  pursuant  to \nthis Order  shall  be  included  in  the  baseline  number  of \nvouchers  used  for  calculation of  voucher  renewal  funding. \nHUD  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  reduce  DHA's  baseline  by \none  voucher  for  each Voucher  that  is not  used  in compliance \n-3-\n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2123   Filed 03/08/01    Page 4 of 19   PageID 915\nwith of  the  terms  of  this Order.  Once  a  class  member  who \nhas  received  a  Voucher  ceases  to participate  in  the  Section \n8  program,  the  Voucher  shall  no  longer  be  subject  to  the \nrequirements  of  this Order but  shall be  subject  only  to the \nrequirements  of  the ACC  and  the  statutes  and  regulations \nthat  govern  the  Section  8  program. \n5.  The  Vouchers  are  to be  awarded  by DHA  solely to  class \nmembers  that  receive  an  offer of  a  unit  in a  upredominantly \nwhite  area.\"  Such  an  offer  is deemed  by  the  plaintiff class \nto  constitute  a  racially desegregative  housing  opportunity. \nAs  used  in this  Order,  the  term  \"predominantly white  area\" \nmeans  either: \nA.  A  census  tract  that,  according  to  the  most  recent \ndecennial  census,  (i)  has  a  black population at  or \nbelow  the  average  black population of  the  City of \nDallas,  (ii)  has  no  public  housing,  and  (iii)  has  a \npoverty  rate  at  or below  the  average  for  the  City of \nDallas;  or \nB.  A  census  tract  that  the  plaintiffs  and  DHA  agree \nshould be  treated as  a  predominantly white  area. \nFair Market  Rent  Exception \n6.

HUD  authorizes  the  applicable \nhigher  payment  standard amount  to  remain  in effect  for any \nVoucher  held by  any  class member  as  long  as  the  Voucher  is \nused  in compliance  with  the  terms  of  ,  5  of  this Order  . \nMobility Counseling  Funding \n7.  HUD  will  provide  an  aggregate  total  of  $4.8  million to DHA \nfor  initial and  follow-up  mobility counseling  to  class \nmembers.

Within  90  days  of  the  effective  date  of  this \nOrder,  HUD  will  make  available  $4.5  million to DHA  for \nmobility  counseling  to  class  members.  If DHA  has  failed  to \nspend  any  of  this  money  by  December  7,  2007,  HUD  may \nrecapture  the  entire  amount  of  any  such  unspent  funds. \nRegional  Opportunity  Counseling  Funds \n8.

These  funds  shall  be  used  for  mobility \ncounseling  and  no  longer will  be  subject  to  the  regulatory \nand  other  requirements  of  the  ROC  program,  including  the \nrequirement  that  DHA  retain a  nonprofit  organization  to \nadminister  the  funds.  Such  ROC  funds  shall  be  made \n-5-\n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2123   Filed 03/08/01    Page 6 of 19   PageID 917\navailable  to DHA  subject  to  the  requirement  that  the  funds \nbe  used  solely  for  mobility  counseling  for  members  of  the \nclass  in  this  case  and  in accordance  with  the  terms  of  this \nOrder.  This  funding  may  be  treated by  DHA  in the  same  way \nit treats  the  funds  pursuant  to  ,  7,  above.  If DHA  has \nfailed  to  spend  any of  this money  by December  7,  2007,  HUD \nmay  recapture  the  entire  amount  of  any  such unspent  funds. \nAdditional  Administrative  Fees \n9.  HUD  will  grant  DHA  a  one-time  payment  of  an  additional  $1000 \nin administrative  fees  (extraordinary  fees)  for  each of  the \n3,205  Vouchers  provided  for  in  this  Order.  This  money  shall \nbe  provided on  a  per-voucher basis  in accordance  with HUD \nrules,  regulations,  and  procedures  relating  to  the  payment \nof  Section  8  administrative  fees  after DHA,  in  its Section  8 \nprogram  year-end  statement,  notifies  HUD  that  a  lease  to \nwhich  a  voucher  hereunder  applies  has  been  executed.  These \nextraordinary  fees  may  be  used  for  the  following  three \npurposes,  or  for  such other purposes  as  HUD,  in  its sole \ndiscretion,  permits.  First,  DHA  may  use  the  extraordinary \nfees  to  pay per-unit  bonuses  to  landlords  of  units  in a \npredominantly white  area who  agree  to  participate,  for  the \nfirst  time,  in  the  Section  8  voucher  program.  Second,  DHA \nmay  use  the  extraordinary  fees  to  assist  class members  in \nthe  payment  of  apartment  lease application  fees.  Third,  DHA \n-6-\n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2123   Filed 03/08/01    Page 7 of 19   PageID 918\nmay  use  the  extraordinary fees  to pay  for  mobility \ncounseling  for  class members. \n10.  HUD  hereby  authorizes  DHA  to  use  its Section  8 \nadministrative  fee  reserves,  if any,  to assist  class members \nwith  security deposits,  moving  expenses,  and  utility \ndeposits. \n11.  Until  HUD  determines  that  it has  met  its obligations under \nthis Order,  HUD  shall  send  a  report  to all parties on or \nbefore  November  15th of  each year setting forth  the  total \nnumber  of  Vouchers  allocated,  and  funds  released  to  DHA \nhereunder. \nPart  II:  Conditions  and  Release  and Ter.mination of  the Litigation \n12.  HUD  is  not  responsible  for  the  performance  of  any  other \nparty  in  this  action pursuant  to  this  Order  or  to  any  other \nConsent  Decree,  order,  or  agreement  in  this  action.  It  is \nexpressly  agreed  among  the  parties  to  this  Order  that  HUD  is \nnot,  and  shall  not  be,  responsible  for  ensuring  that  class \nmembers  are  offered or  are  placed  in housing  consistent  with \nthe  terms  of  ,  5,  above. \n13.  Nothing  in this  agreement  shall  be  construed  to  require  HUD \nto  provide  additional  funding,  other  than  that  which  is \nexpressly  agreed  to  herein.

HUD  shall not  be  found  to be  in violation of \nthis Order  on  account  of  any  failure  to  perform any \nobligation  imposed  upon  HUD  by  the  terms  of  this Order  that \nresults  (i)  from  the  unavailability of  funding  from  Congress \nnecessary  for  performance,  or  (ii)  from  the  modification or \nrevocation of  statutory authority,  that  is necessary  for \nsuch performance  by HUD.  If HUD  does  not  commit  funding  for \na  total  of  3,205  Vouchers  by  December  5,  2007,  and  the \nfunding  of  extraordinary fees  in connection with  such \nVouchers,  then  the  exclusive  remedy  to which  the  plaintiffs \nshall  be  entitled is  to  seek  a  court  order  requiring HUD  to \ncommit  the  funding  to  DHA  for  the  outstanding  balance  of \nsuch Vouchers  and  to  provide  the  funding  of  extraordinary \nfees  in connection  with  such  Vouchers.  If  HUD  does  not \ncomply  with  the  requirements  of  11  2,  6,  7  and  8  of  this \nOrder  within  90  days  after the  effective  date  hereof,  then \nthe  exclusive  remedy  to which  the  plaintiffs  shall  be \nentitled  is  to  seek  a  court  order  requiring HUD  to  comply \nwith  the  specific  obligations  of  these  paragraphsi  provided, \nhowever,  that  plaintiffs must  exercise  the  right  to  seek \nsuch a  court  order within  45  days  after  the  deadline \n-8-\n\n                                                                                         \n Case 3:85-cv-01210-O   Document 2123   Filed 03/08/01    Page 9 of 19   PageID 920\nhereunder  for performance  of  the  specific obligations of \nthese  paragraphs  by HUD,  i.e.,  within  135  days  after the \neffective  date  hereof. \n14.

Introduction \nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has provided the Housing \nAuthority of the City of Dallas, Texas (DHA) 3,205 vouchers pursuant to HUD's Settlement \nStipulation and Order entered March 8, 2001 in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of \nTexas, Dallas Division (\"Settlement Stipulation\").  These vouchers will replace 3,205 public \nhousing units DHA is required to develop in Predominantly White Areas as stipulated in the \nRemedial Order Affecting DHA, entered February 7, 1995. \nThis Settlement Voucher Implementation Plan (Plan) is created pursuant to the Order Approving \nPlan for DHA 's Implementation ofH  UD Settlement as DHA 's Section 8 Substitution Plan, \nentered April26, 2001 (Substitution Plan).  The Substitution Plan requires DHA to submit an \nannual Plan for implementing the Substitution Plan, together with a proposed budget.  On \nFebruary 1, 2007, the Court took evidence and heard oral argument concerning objections to \nDHA 's Amended Proposed Settlement Voucher Implementation Plan and Budget.  The Court \nordered each party to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on the remaining \ncontested issues.  After careful consideration of all parties' submissions and oral argument, the \nCourt issued Memorandum Opinion and Order on May 17, 2007. \nThe Substitution Plan requires DHA to inform, counsel, encourage, and assist class members to \nmove to Predominantly White Areas, as defined in Section II ofthis Plan.

Mobility \nThe Area of Operation for Landlord recruitment and mobility services includes the City \nof Dallas, Dallas County, the City of Plano, and the City ofRed Oak.  However, nothing \nin this Plan precludes DHA from making an effort to de-concentrate poverty by \npromoting, encouraging, and providing housing opportunities in Predominantly White \nAreas within Collin, Denton, Ellis, Kaufman, Rockwall and Tarrant counties.  The \nSettlement Voucher may be used to lease units in eligible census tracts located in the \nseven counties of Collin Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Kaufman, Rockwall and Tarrant. \nParticipants who locate housing outside ofDHA's Area of Operation may be allowed to \nuse the portability feature of the Voucher, provided the receiving housing authority \nagrees to administer the voucher with a Payment Standard up to 125% of the current Fair \nMarket Rent (FMR) and also agrees not to absorb the Voucher.  Except as otherwise \nprovided herein, the mobility counseling services and financial incentives offered by this \nPlan (application fee assistance, security deposit assistance, child care, credit counseling, \nfair housing education and assistance, and moving expenses) will be administered by \nDHA for the final allocation of Settlement Voucher Participants. \nF.  Payment Standards \nHUD authorized DHA to establish a Payment Standard up to 125% of the current FMR \nfor the Program.  DHA has established a payment standard of 125% of the current FMR \nof the Program.  HUD authorized the applicable higher payment standard amount to \nremain in effect for any Settlement Voucher held by any class member provided the \nvoucher is used in a Predominantly White Area. This payment standard is applicable for \nthe initial move and subsequent relocation of the Participants provided they remain in a \nPredominantly White Area.  Participants leasing outside of a Predominantly White Area \nwill permanently lose the benefits of their enhanced vouchers.  See Settlement \nStipulation, ~ 6. \nSection V.

Mobility Services to Participants \nDHA will offer mobility counseling and services designed to address the barriers that class \nmembers encounter when searching for housing in Predominantly White Areas.  Vouchers are \nissued in 30-day increments to ensure consistent contact between the DHA counselor and \nParticipant.

DHA's obligation to \nconduct outreach for specific landlords is restricted to landlords in DHA's \nArea of Operation. \nSee Substitution Plan,, 9(d). \nF.  Credit Counseling \nLandlord with units in Predominantly White Areas may be reluctant to lease to \nParticipants with poor credit or rental history.  DHA will work with the Participant to \nidentify and resolve derogatory credit and/or rental history that could impact the \nParticipants ability to find housing using the Settlement Voucher.  Serious credit or rental \nissues may be impossible to resolve during the term of the permit, and applicants with \nserious credit and/or rental issues will be identified during the orientation.  Such \napplicants will be encouraged to wait for a HCV; however the ultimate decision will rest \nwith the potential Participant.  See Substitution Plan, ,  1O  (b ). \nG.

Initial Leasing \nParticipants are provided a temporary permit which authorizes them to search for \nhousing.  When a Participant locates housing in a predominantly White Area that meets \nHousing Quality Standards, and the rent offered by DHA or the receiving housing \nauthority is acceptable to the landlord, the permit will be cancelled, the Settlement \nVoucher will be issued and a Housing Assistance Payment Contract will be executed \nwith the landlord.

Brett  Johnson,  Thomas  M. \noutlined in this case’s Settlement Stipulation and Order of \nMelsheimer,  Fish  &  Richardson,  Dallas,  TX,  for \nMarch  8,  2001.  In  its July  2003  report  to  the  Court \nHighlands  of  McKamy  IV  and  V  Community \nregarding barriers to implementing the Settlement plan, \nImprovement  Ass’n,  Preston  Highlands  Homeowners’ \nthe Dallas Housing Authority (“DHA”) identified two \nAss’n, Inc., David Beer, Ginger Lee. \nmajor reasons cited by families for their failure to locate \nhousing: housing shortage (47%) and clients not meeting \nJoseph G.

Carter, Mike McKool, Jr., McKool Smith, Dallas, TX, \n   1  \n  \n\nWalker  v.  U.S.  Dept.  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  326  F.Supp.2d  773  (2004)     \n  \n  \nPlaintiffs speak specifically to DHA’s assessment, which  their  statutory  “area  of  operation.”  The  restriction  of \nalso announces class members’ preference for housing in  public facility corporation financing to the City hinders \nthe southern Dallas metroplex.  the use of Section 8 vouchers by class members due to \n   limited  housing  development  in  predominantly  white \nUnder the Settlement Stipulation and Order of March 8,  areas.  Public  facility  financial  assistance,  Plaintiffs \n2001, Section 8 housing vouchers are to be awarded by  contend, will reduce the barriers to class members of \nDHA to class members who receive offers in units in  obtaining  voucher  settlement  housing  in  non-black, \n“predominantly white areas.” The agreement and order  non-poverty areas. DHA disagrees with Plaintiffs over \ndefines a “predominantly white area” as “a census tract  whether  DHA’s  use  of  public  facility  financing \nthat, according to the most recent decennial census, (i) has  corporations will necessarily prevent the resegregation of \na  black  population  at  or  below  the  average  black  class members and  whether the use  of  public  facility \npopulation  of  the  City  of  Dallas,  (ii)  has  no  public  corporation financing will ensure the availability of units \nhousing, and (iii) has a poverty rate at or below the  for class members. \naverage for the City of Dallas; or a census tract that the    \nplaintiffs  and  DHA  agree  should  be  treated  as  a  DHA does not oppose the establishment of public facility \npredominantly white area.”  corporations outside their statutory area of operation, but \n   they do not believe that they are legally authorized to \nDHA disagrees with a number of facts recited by the  finance privately owned housing outside DHA’s area of \nPlaintiffs,  including  the  housing  segregation  trends  operation. To confirm their understanding of state law, \nrevealed  by  census  data  at  different  levels.  Plaintiffs  and without notice to Plaintiffs, DHA contacted the Texas \ncontend  that  DHA’s  data,  which  reports  at  the  Attorney General by letter on September 30, 2003. T. \ncensus-tract level, overstates the extent of desegregation.  Lynn Stuck, Assistant Attorney General and Chief of the \nPlaintiffs offer the alternative methodology of reporting  Public Finance Division, replied on October 1, 2003. The \non  the  Settlement  class  members  according  to  more  reply reiterates DHA’s position that the Attorney General \nneighborhood-like census tract block groups. Plaintiffs  is aware of no authority: (1) that would allow DHA to \noffer  evidence  that  class  members  are  becoming  finance property outside its area of operation, and (2) that \nincreasingly  concentrated  within  the  cities  of  Dallas,  would allow a public finance corporation created by DHA \nIrving, Garland, and Mesquite. At the same time, White  to finance property outside its area of operation. (DHA \nand  Latina/o  Section  8  families  are  becoming  less  Exh 1.) While not a formal opinion, the letter “represents \nconcentrated in Dallas, Irving, Garland, and Mesquite.  only the position that would be applied by the Public \nDHA offers nothing to contradict Plaintiffs’ findings.  Finance Division in the course of its review of bonds \n   issued by a public facility corporation created by DHA.” \nDHA  currently  provides  public  facility  financial  Id. In other words, the Attorney General has indicated a \nassistance for housing development located within the  likelihood of bond disapproval in the event that DHA \nCity of Dallas (“Dallas” or “City”). Plaintiffs urge that  creates a public facility corporation and attempts to issue \nDHA “set up a public facility corporation that can provide  bonds to assist in the financing of housing outside DHA’s \nmultifamily developers with lower interest rate loans and  area of operation. On this basis, Plaintiffs seek to add T. \nlow-income  tax  credits.”  (Motion  at  1.)  Under  this  Lynn Stuck as a Defendant and move to enjoin her from \nfinancing  scheme,  DHA  may  condition  developers’  disapproving DHA’s public facility bonds. \nfunding incentives on the institution of programs that    \neliminate the barriers currently preventing class members   \nfrom using the vouchers in predominantly white areas   \naccessing housing as described *775 in the Settlement. \nDevelopers will receive financial benefits for increasing \nthe supply of available Section 8 units. \nII. ANALYSIS \n  \nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin DHA from continuing its current \n \npractice of providing public facility financial assistance \nonly for housing located within Dallas. They ask that \nDHA  use  its  authority  to  create  public  facility  A. Financing Residential Development under the \ncorporations  to  geographically  expand  its  financial  Texas Local Government Code \nassistance  to  areas  outside  DHA’s  current  area  of  In  seeking  to  enjoin  DHA  to  provide  public  facility \noperation. DHA contends that they are restricted by state  corporation financing to residential development outside \nand federal law from developing housing outside Dallas,  the City limits, Plaintiffs make three arguments. First, \n   2  \n  \n\nWalker  v.  U.S.  Dept.  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  326  F.Supp.2d  773  (2004)     \n  \n  \nPlaintiffs contend that because Texas Local Government  392.066(a)(1)  (Vernon  Supp.2004).  Section  394.004 \nCode (the “Code”) does not specifically and affirmatively  applies Chapter 394 to residential development when at \nrestrict  “residential  development”  outside  a  housing  least 90% of the residential development serves low or \nauthority’s area  of  operation,  DHA  should  offer  such  moderate income persons. Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code Ann. § \nfinancing  to  developers  and  owners  of  residential  394.004 (Vernon 1999). Chapter 394 (the “Texas Housing \ndevelopments outside the City. Second, Plaintiffs argue  Finance  Corporation  Act”)  is  intended  to  “provide  a \nthat if Defendants’ interpretation is correct, and Texas law  means to finance the cost of residential ownership and \nrestricts public facility corporation financing to the City,  development.” Id. at § 394.002(a). It defines residential \nthen  the  Fair  Housing  Act  should  preempt  state  law  development as “for the purpose of providing decent, safe, \nbecause  the  Code  permits  actions  that  constitute  and sanitary housing and nonhousing facilities that are an \ndiscriminatory housing practices. Last, Plaintiffs reason  integral part of or functionally related to any affordable \nthat DHA’s failure to offer public facility corporation  housing project, whether in one or multiple locations.”2 \nfinancing  to  developers  outside  Dallas  constitutes  a    \nviolation of DHA’s Fourteenth *776 Amendment duty to  *777 [1] In sum, a housing authority may create a public \nremedy the segregative effects of their prior policies.  facility corporation, and that public facility corporation \n   may  provide  financial  assistance  to  residential \nTexas  state  law  provides  that  a  municipal  housing  developments or housing projects. Texas law specifically \nauthority may not undertake a housing project outside its  restricts a housing authority’s power to operate, construct, \narea  of operation  unless the  municipality in  which it  and lease a “housing project” to its area of operation, but \nwishes to locate a housing project adopts a resolution  it does not specifically disallow “residential development” \nauthorizing  the  housing  authority  to  act  within  that  outside its area of operation. Residential developments are \npolitical  subdivision.  Tex.  Loc.  Gov’t  Code  Ann.  §  legally distinct from housing projects, but they must be \n392.017(b) (Vernon 1999).

 \nbecause  of  this,  some  DHA  projects  which  were  predominately  white  were  actually  treated  as  minority  units.  \n  \n  \n20   The  DHA  First  Annual  Report,  p.  65  (Jan.  20,  1988),  indicates  that  the  Tenant  Selection  &  Assignment  Procedures  were  \nimplemented  on  June  29,  1987,  but  revised  on  Dec.  17,  1987  (just  prior  to  the  Dec.  21,  1987  hearing  ).  \n  \n  \n21   These  included  recruitment  of  “owners  of  private  rental  housing”  in  non-­‐impacted  areas  to  participate  in  the  §  8  program,  \nassisting  and  counseling  with  families  who  desire  §  8  housing,  and  assisting  in  “tenant  relocation  programs”  under  the  Decree.  \n  \n(Decree  Plan,  Summary  2).  \n  \n22   The  City’s  offer  of  this  “loan”  was  worthless.  See  Walker  III,  at  fn.  71.  \n  \n  \n23   In  fact,  on  March  5,  1987,  DHA  asked  HUD  for  approval  to  use  the  lead  settlement  funds  for  mobility  and  relocation  costs  under  \nthe  Decree—and,  in  only  five  days,  HUD  granted  this  request  on  March  10,  1987.  DHA  First  Annual  Report,  pp.  35–36  (Jan.  20,  \n  \n1988).  \n  \n24   At  the  March  25,  1988  Hearing,  DHA’s  attorney  advised  the  Court  of  these  other  possibilities  for  funding:  (i)  proceeds  from  the  \nsale  of  Washington  Place;  (ii)  the  Lake  West  Settlement  Fund;  (iii)  the  Mustang  Village  Fund;  and  (iv)  obtaining  a  loan  using  \n  \nvacant  DHA  land  as  collateral.  At  the  Sept.  18,  1987  Hearing,  a  letter  from  DHA  Executive  Director  Jack  Herrington  to  a  HUD  \nattorney,  showed  the  amounts  supposedly  available  to  DHA  at  that  time:  (i)  Washington  Place  Sale—$9.1  million;  (ii)  Lake  West  \nSettlement—$684,000;  and  (iii)  Mustang  Village  Fund—$130,000.  \n  \n25   Contrary  testimony  was  given  by  other  DHA  employees—including  David  Morton,  DHA  Deputy  Executive  Director  and  Charles  \nCrane,  DHA  Acting  Executive  Director—at  the  March  25  and  Dec.  12,  1988  Hearings.  The  Court  discounts  this  testimony  because  \n  \nit  was  not  credible;  in  contrast,  Craig  Gardner’s  testimony  was  very  credible—both  at  the  March  25,  1988  Hearing  (when  he  was  \na  DHA  employee)  and  at  the  December  12,  1988  Hearing  (after  he  had  been  fired  by  DHA  Acting  Executive  Director  Charles  \nCrane).  \n  \n26   Dews  also  testified  that  people  had  trouble  “getting  through”  on  the  phone  to  their  case  workers.  This  was  confirmed  by  David  \nMorton,  Deputy  Executive  Director  of  DHA,  at  the  March  28,  1988  Hearing—and  Morton  also  testified  that  DHA  had  finally  come  \n  \nup  with  a  way  to  deal  with  this  problem,  over  one  year  after  the  Decree  became  effective.  According  to  the  DHA  First  \nSemi–Annual  Report,  p.  9  (July  20,  1988),  DHA  established  a  “Tenant  Hotline”  on  April  27,  1988.  \n  \n27   On  Oct.  14,  1988,  Jack  Herrington  resigned  as  Executive  Director,  and  Charles  Crane  was  named  Acting  Executive  Director.  DHA  \n   34  \n  \n\nWalker  v.  U.S.  Dept.  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  734  F.Supp.  1231  (1989)     \n  \n  \n   Second  Semi–Annual  Report,  p.  3  (Jan.  20,  1989).  \n  \n28   Plaintiffs’  Response  to  DHA  Report  No.  1,  p.  12  (May  12,  1987).  \n  \n  \n29   There  was  no  similar  restriction  on  the  number  of  §  8  tenants  in  an  apartment  complex  in  a  minority  or  impacted  area.  \n  \n  \n30   This  additional  material  included  a  rent  survey  by  DHA  which  showed  that  §  8  certificates  could  not  be  used  to  accomplish  the  \ndecree’s  goal  of  providing  expanded  housing  opportunities  in  non-­‐impacted  areas  without  the  120%  rent  exception.  \n  \n  \n31   For  example,  a  §  8  certificate  tenant  in  a  non-­‐impacted  area  would  not  have  to  pay  more  than  30%  of  adjusted  income  in  rent  \nand  utility  expense;  however,  a  §  8  voucher  tenant  in  the  same  non-­‐impacted  area  could  be  required  to  pay  from  33  1/3%  to  \n  \n95.56%  of  gross  income  for  rent  and  utilities.  \n  \n32   In  its  First  Annual  Report,  pp.  18–19  (Jan.  20,  1988),  DHA  stated  that  this  refusal  of  a  120%  rent  exemption  for  vouchers  would  \n“discourage  participants  from  relocating  in  non-­‐impacted  areas”  and  “will  present  problems  in  the  long  term  implementation  of  \n  \nthe  Consent  Decree.”  \n  \n33   Because  of  its  violations  of  the  Decree’s  requirements  concerning  the  120%  Fair  Market  Rent  Exceptions,  DHA  is  liable  for  the  \nretroactive  relief  sought  by  the  plaintiffs’  Feb.  8,  1988  motion—for  those  class  members  who  paid  excessive  amounts  under  their  \n  \n§  8  vouchers.  Although  this  problem  was  initially  caused  by  HUD’s  refusal  of  the  120%  rent  exception  for  vouchers,  once  HUD  \nchanged  its  position  on  August  31,  1988,  DHA  refused  to  implement  this  much-­‐needed  exception—and  probably  would  not  have  \ndone  so  by  January  4,  1989,  but  for  the  incredible  testimony  given  by  its  Acting  Executive  Director  at  the  December  12,  1988  \nHearing.  Therefore,  the  retroactive  relief  should  be  paid  solely  by  DHA.  \n  \n34   Under  the  Decree,  30%  of  the  §  8  units  were  to  be  located  in  non-­‐impacted  areas  at  the  end  of  the  second  Decree  year—and  50%  \nof  the  §  8  units  were  to  be  in  use  in  non-­‐impacted  areas  at  the  end  of  the  third  Decree  year.  (Decree  Plan  III,  12–A).  \n  \n  \n35   DHA’s  First  Annual  Report  (Jan.  20,  1988)  gave  the  figure  of  3,690  for  certificates  and  vouchers  in  use  as  of  the  initial  decree  \nmonth.  DHA’s  First  Semi–Annual  Report  (July  20,  1988)  indicates  that  the  initial  decree  month  figure  was  3,743.  \n  \n  \n36   Tony  Rios,  DHA  Director  of  Housing  Applications  &  Eligibility,  protested  about  this  decision  to  keep  the  §  8  program  closed—but  \nto  no  avail.  \n  \n  \n37   Morton’s  attempted  justification  for  this  decision—that  DHA  was  trying  to  meet  the  Decree’s  requirements  concerning  relocation  \nof  persons  from  West  Dallas  and  other  DHA  projects—would  (even  if  true)  simply  demonstrate  again  the  failure  of  DHA  to  \n  \ncommit  adequate  resources  to  the  Consent  Decree.  \n  \n38   At  the  end  of  the  first  Decree  year,  the  total  number  of  families  receiving  either  public  housing  or  §  8  assistance  from  DHA  \ndeclined  from  9,161  to  8,471.  \n  \n  \n39   In  contrast,  at  the  end  of  the  second  Decree  year,  DHA  had  5,233  §  8  units  in  use,  and  2108  of  these  (some  40%)  were  in  \nnon-­‐impacted  areas  (DHA  Second  Annual  Report,  Appendix  1)—and  on  June  30,  1989,  DHA  had  5,435  §  8  units  in  use,  and  2465  \n  \nof  these  (some  45%)  were  in  non-­‐impacted  areas  (DHA  Report  #  7,  Appendix  1).  \n  \n40   On  January  20,  1987,  there  were  3,627  §  8  units  in  use;  on  March  21,  there  were  3,860  vouchers  and  certificates  in  use—with  \nover  half  of  the  increase  of  153  units  taking  place  in  the  three  weeks  before  the  March  25,  1988  Hearing.  \n  \n  \n41   March  25,  1988  Hearing:  Pls.Exh.  17  (July  20,  1987  letter  to  DHA  from  HUD);  Testimony  of  Jack  Herrington  (Tr.  52).  \n  \n  \n42   David  Morton,  who  gave  the  instructions  about  “minor  violations”  in  August  1987,  testified  that  he  did  not  learn  about  this  until  \nthe  March  25,  1988  Hearing—but  he  attributed  the  entire  fault  for  this  Decree  violation  to  his  staff  “who  didn’t  follow  through.”  \n  \n  \n43   Harry  Jones,  Dallas  Assistant  City  Manager,  testified  that,  as  of  December  12,  1988,  DHA  had  still  not  notified  the  City  of  the  units  \n“DHA  wanted  inspected  in  December”—even  though  the  City  was  averaging  500  inspections  a  month  for  DHA.  \n  \n  \n   35  \n  \n\nWalker  v.  U.S.  Dept.  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  734  F.Supp.  1231  (1989)     \n  \n  \n44   Perhaps  as  a  result  of  this,  of  the  479  units  on  which  DHA  requested  code  enforcement  from  April–October  1988,  the  City  of  \nDallas  opened  code  enforcement  files  on  only  180  of  these  requests.  \n  \n  \n45   See  the  “Not  In  My  Neighborhood”  discussions,  Chapters  One–Five,  in  the  Walker  III  opinion.  In  the  past,  DHA  has  not  hesitated  \nto  use  eminent  domain  when  acquiring  property  for  its  black  projects,  including  the  West  Dallas  project.  See  Miers  v.  Housing  \n  \nAuthority  of  the  City  of  Dallas,  266  S.W.2d  487  (Tex.1954);  Housing  Authority  of  the  City  of  Dallas  v.  Higginbotham,  135  Tex.  158,  \n143  S.W.2d  79,  95  (1940).  \n  \n46   DHA  actually  selected  the  Country  Creek  site  in  1986  for  the  development  of  106  Washington  Place  replacement  units,  but  \nchanged  this  decision  because  of  neighborhood  opposition  and  local  political  pressure.  See  the  Walker  III  opinion.  \n  \n  \n47   Consistency  is  certainly  not  a  requirement  in  opposing  public  housing.  Some  opposed  the  100  units  at  Country  Creek  because  this  \nwas  “too  large  a  project  for  public  housing”—while,  at  the  same  time,  they  opposed  demolition  of  even  the  1200  units  at  the  \n  \n3500–unit  West  Dallas  project  that  had  been  vacant  and  uninhabitable  for  over  10  years.  See  the  Walker  III  opinion.  \n  \n48   In  the  transcript  of  the  Sept.  18,  1987  Hearing,  this  date  (and  two  others)  appear  as  “July  20,  1989.”  This  was  an  obvious  mistake  \nsince  the  Decree  required  that  the  100  units  be  ready  for  initial  occupancy  within  24  months  from  January  20,  1987.  \n  \n  \n49   The  “Frost  amendment,”  passed  on  Dec.  22,  1987,  purported  to  prohibit  the  use  of  any  HUD  funds  for  the  demolition  of  housing  \nunits  at  West  Dallas.  Public  Law  100–202,  101  Stat.  1329–213.  But  see  this  Court’s  opinion  in  Walker  II.  \n  \n  \n50   However,   because   of   the   horrible   conditions   in   West   Dallas   (see   Walker   III   ),   only   2.1%—21   persons   out   of   1000  \napplicants—actually  chose  to  move  into  West  Dallas.  \n  \n  \n51   In  addition,  there  were  obvious  mistakes  made  by  DHA  with  the  §  8  waiting  list;  for  example,  on  March  25,  1988,  DHA  conceded  \nthat  the  person  on  the  top  of  the  §  8  waiting  list  should  not  have  been  there—because  she  was  not  a  tenant  in  another  DHA  \n  \nproject.  See  Decree  Plan,  Summary  3.  \n  \n52   For  example,  the  demolition  of  units  at  West  Dallas  under  the  Decree  and  this  Court’s  approval  of  the  demolition  plans.  See  the  \nWalker  II  opinion.  \n  \n  \n1   In  a  separate  order  the  Court  has  approved  the  requested  class  certification.  Baker  v.  Wade,  553  F.Supp.  1121,  1125  n.  1  \n(N.D.Tex.1982).  \n  \n  \n2   The  West  Dallas  Project  has  historically  been  subject  to  a  15%  to  20%  turnover  rate  per  year  according  to  the  testimony  of  DHA’s  \nExecutive  Director,  Jack  Herrington.  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \nEnd  of  Document     \n  \n  \n \n  \n   36  \n  ",
