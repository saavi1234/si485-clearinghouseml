    "summary": "<p>On December 24, 2002, Plaintiff Gamino filed a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, raising Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment challenges against the Ventura County Sheriff's blanket policy of strip searching all individuals booked into the Ventura County Jail on suspicion of being under the influence of illegal drugs.  Defendants answered Plaintiff's complaint by generally denying the allegations.  </p><p>On September 17, 2003, the District Court (Judge Consuelo B. Marshall) entered a stipulated order certifying the case as a class action.  The class was defined as consisting of all person who were arrested under Health and Safety Code subsection 11550 and strip searched in Ventura County between December 24, 2001, and March 27, 2003.  </p><p>This case was a companion case to Way v. County of Ventura (located in this database at JC-CA-40), which challenged the same practice.  In Way, the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, finding that (a) the challenged strip search, conducted pursuant to the County's policy, violated the Fourth Amendment and (b) Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.  Defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit.  </p><p>The District Court in Gamino (Judge Marshall) entered an order providing that the liability in the Gamino case would be ultimately controlled by the appellate outcome in Way.  Consequently Judge Marshall removed the Gamino case from the active docket while the Way appeal was pending in the Ninth Circuit.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals handed down its opinion in Way on April 20, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's determination that the strip search was unconstitutional, and that the qualified immunity defense was unavailable to Ventura County.  The Ninth Circuit determined, however, that the individual defendant deputies were entitled to qualified immunity.  Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2006).  Certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court.  Ventura County v. Way, 127 S.Ct. 665 (2006).</p><p>Following the Ninth Circuit's decision in Way, the parties in Gamino engaged in extensive settlement negotiations.  They agreed to have the Honorable Edward A. Infante act as the settlement officer and special master.  In March 2007, the District Court referred the case to Magistrate Judge Charles F. Eick for settlement purposes.  Judge Eick subsequently conducted numerous settlement conferences with the parties.</p><p>On July 25, 2008, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, which was approved by the court on February 5, 2009.  Under the terms of the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay each of the class representatives $50,000.  Tier 1 class plaintiffs were to be paid $250 each, Tier 2 class plaintiffs were to be paid $650 each, Tier 3 class plaintiffs were to be paid $2300 if they were wrongfully searched only once and $3000 if they were searched twice.  The defendants also agreed to pay a lump attorney fee sum to the plaintiff class counsel in the amount of $1.4 million.  The defendants agreed to pay up to $250,000 in administrative costs for the settlement.</p>",

The case was\n6\nsettledon terms enumeratedinthe PreliminaryApproval Orderand documents\n7\nattached thereto, andthose terms will notbe repeated here.\n8\nThe custom andpractice that was the basis ofthis lawsuitwas ceased as a\n9\n10 result ofthe litigation in the related action, Way v. County a/Ventura, 445 F.3d\n1157 (9th Cir. 2006) (hereafter Way) and this case. Way was an individual plaintiff\n11\n12 case, also before this Court. Gamino was filed separately after Way, as a class\n13 action. After favorable decisions in this Court and the Ninth Circuit, granting\n14 summaryjudgmentto plaintiffWay on liability, Way was settled for a total of\n15 $575,000. Ofthat amount, $500,000 was for fees and costs, and the remainder was\n16 for the plaintiff.\n17 This case subsequently settled, after extensive mediationefforts. The Court\n18 approved the settlementat a hearing held on February2, 2009. [Doc. No. 182.]\n19 Under the settlement, defendants wouldpay sums to class representatives, and\n20 various sums to class members who file claims, and would payfor the cost ofclass\n21 administration. In addition, defendants wouldpay$1,400,000 inattorneys' fees\n22 and costs, subjectto the approval ofthis Court.\n23 Plaintiffs filed a motion for attorneys' fees seeking the $1,400,000 award\n24 agreedto, based onboth a class fuhd theory and a lodestar with a multipliertheory.\n25 Forthe reasons statedbelow, the Court awards Plaintiffs' counsel $1,400,000 in\n26 attorneys' fees and costs.\n27\n28\n2\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 3 of 14\n1\nLEGALSTANDARD\n2\nIt is well settled in theNinth Circuitthat, \"[i]n a common fund case, the\n3\ndistrict court has discretion to apply eitherthe lodestarmethod orthepercentage-\n4\nof-the-fund method in calculating a fee award.\" Fischel v. EquitableLife\n5\nAssuranceSoc); ofthe U.S., 307 F.3d 997, 1006 (9th Cir.2002). \"Reasonableness\n6\nis the goal.\"Id. at 1007. To calculate an award ofreasonable attorney's fees,\n7\ncourts use the lodestarformulation set forth inHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424,\n8\n433 (1983), which instructs the court to takethe number ofhours reasonably\n9\nexpended on the litigationand multiply itby areasonable hourly rate. In\n10\ndeterminingthe \"lodestarfigure,\" courts must consider the Kerr factors:\n11\n(1) the time and labor required, (2) the novelty and difficulty of the\n12\nquestions involved, (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service\nproperly, (4) the preclusion ofother employ!uent by the attorney due\n13\nto acceptance oftlle case, (5) the customary fee, (6) whether the fee is\n14 fixed or contingent, (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the\ncircumstances, (8) the amount involved ana the results obtained, (9)\n15 the experience reputation, and abili~ of the attorneys, (10} the\n\"undeSIrability'; of the case, (11) tlie nature and length of the\n16 professional relationship with the client, and (12) awards in similar\ncases.\n17\nKerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d67,70 (9th Cir. 1975).\n18\nDISCUSSION\n19\nA. The Time and Labor ExpendedBy Counsel\n20\nCounsel efforts in litigating this case were substantial. The workperformed\n21\nincluded: 1)extensive investigationofthe underlying circumstances, including\n22\n23 speaking with scores ofclass members; 2) preparation ofthe complaint; 3) the\n24 Rule 26 conference and report; 4) three requests forproductionofdocuments; 5)\n25 extensive analysis ofdocuments produced; 6) three set ofinterrogatories; 7) 12\n26 depositions; 8) three discovery motions; 9) a motion to compel SheriffBrooks'\n27 deposition; 10) three summaryjudgmentmotions; 11) two published appeals in\nWay (one remandingbecause appealed orderwas not final forpurposes ofappeal,\n28\nand the secondupholding this Court's grant ofsummaryjudgmentto Plaintiff\n3\n\nCa e 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 4 of 14\n1\nWay); 12) preparation and mailing offirst class notice (pre-settlement); 13)\n2\nhandling ofhundreds ofclass members' calls after mailing offirst class notice; 14)\n3\nretention ofdata consultants and extensiveanalysis ofcomputerizedjail data; 15)\n4\nlist ofcharges qualifying as charges ofviolence, weapons ordrugs for purposes of\n5\nthe different levels ofclass claims; 16) three days ofunsuccessful mediation efforts\n6\nwith Ret. Magistrate Judge Edward Infante (including multiplemediation\n7\nsessions); 17) four mediation sessions with Magistrate Judge Charles Eick;\n8\n9 18) preparation of a l4-page mediation letterin anticipation ofmediation with\n10 Ret. United States DistrictJudge Raul Ramirez; 19) two days ofmediation sessions\n11 with Judge Ramirez; 20) and negotiation andpreparation ofsettlement documents,\n12 including settlement agreement, preliminaryand final approval orders, class notice\n13 and claim forms.\n14 In summary, the time and efforts expendedby Class Counsel were extensive\n15 and involved all that occurs in a case that is being prepared for trial.\n16 B. The Novelty and Difficulty ofthe Issues and Counsel's Skill\n17 The issues involved inthis case involve complex issues ofconstitutional law\n18 in an area where considerabledeference is given tojail officials, as the Ninth\n19 Circuit recognized inthepartial summarydecision in this case. See Way v. County\n20 ofVentura, supra, 445 F.3d at 1161 (9th Cir.2006) (\"We recognize the difficulty of\n21 operating a detention facility safely, the seriousness ofthe risk ofsmuggled\n22 weapons and contraband, and the deference we owejailofficials' exercise of\n23 judgment in adopting and executingpolicies necessaryto maintain institutional\n24 security.\"); see also Craft v. County ofSan Bernardino, 468 F.Supp.2d 1172,\n25 1176 (C.D.Cal. 2006) (quoting Way).\n26 The Way case, whichprovidedthe legal foundation for the settlementhere\n27 (as the parties stipulatedthat the outcome ofWay would govern liabilityhere),\n28 involved difficult questions ofconstitutional law.A good snapshot ofthe state of\n4\n\nCa e 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 5 of 14\n1\nthe law at the time is contained in Way v. County o/Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157,1159\n2\n(9th Cir.2006), wherethe Courtprovided the following summary:\n3\nWay brought this civil rights action '\" alleging that they violated her\n4 civil rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by\nsubjecting her to a bodycavity search following her arrest. Theparties\n5 both filed motions for summaryjudgment. The district court he1d that\nthe search violated Way's constitutional rights because individualized\n6 suspicion is required for arrestees who are not admitted to the general\njail population. It denied qualified immunity to Brooks and Hanson on\n7 the basis of Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 616-17 (9th Cir.1984)\n(per curiam), overruled on other grounds lzJ! Hodgers-Durgin v. de la\n8 )7ina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.l (9th Cir.l999) (en banc)i Kennedy v.\nLos Angeles Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Lir.1990) (as\n9\namended), implied overruling on other grounds recogllized b]J Act\nUpflPortland v. Bagley\" 971 F.2d 298, 301 (9th Cir.1992); andFuller\n10\nv. MG. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1446 (9th Cir.1991), holding that a\nreasonable officer reviewing Ventura's p'olicy and the establisned law\n11\nwould have recognized tliat the Sheriff Dep'artment's policy was\nunconstitutional because it did not further any legitimate penological\n12\ninterests. That ruling is the subject ofthis appeal.\n13\nWhat was distinct about this case and the Way case was that it involved strip\n14\nsearches ofarrestees charged with adrug offense. The Ninth Circuit had ruled long\n15\nbefore that the involvement ofdrugs supplied reasonable suspicion for a strip\n16\nsearch. See, e.g., Thompson v. City a/Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9thCir.\n17\n1989)(reasonable suspicion maybe suppliedbythe nature ofthe charge).\n18\nThus, the plaintiffin Way hadto prevail on the argument that being under\n19\nthe influenceofdrugs was fundamentally different inkind from possession or\n20\ntrafficking in drugs and did notprovide reasonable suspicionfor a strip search.\n21\nPlaintiffsucceededin that contention, paving the way for the current settlement.\n22\nSee Way, 445 F.3dat 1162(\"We cannot see how the charge ofbeingunderthe\n23\n24 influence ofa drug necessarilyposes a threat ofconcealing (and therebyusing or\n25 trafficking) additional drugs injail during the limited time between booking and\n26 bail, orbooking andplacementin the general population. Ifnot, it was\n27 unreasonable to assume that Way harbored drugs in some cavity orother.\").\n28 Plaintiffultimatelyprevailedbefore theNinth Circuit, which acknowledged it had\nnever directly addressed the issue in deciding that the Sheriffwas entitled to\n5\n\nCa e 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 6of 14\n1\nqualified immunity. !d. (\"we had never previouslyaddressedthe constitutionality\n2\nofa bodycavitysearch policypremisedon the nature ofthis orany otherdrug\n3\noffense. More importantly, we had held that the nature ofthe offense alone may\n4\nprovide reasonable suspicion [citation omitted], and twice pointed to charges\n5\ninvolving drugs, contrabandand violence as the kind ofoffense that might give\n6\nrise to reasonable suspicion.\").\n7\nIn addition, properlyhandling the data in cases ofthis type requires ahigh\n8\ndegree ofsophistication. In cases like this, properuse ofthe data is the factual key\n9\nto the case (along with establishing the policies or customs being challenged,\n10\nwhich occurred during the Way case). Itis through the data that members ofthe\n11\nclass are identified. This is usually a sophisticatedprocess, requiring counsel\n12\nfamiliar withboth the facts ofthe case and how to use the data. Jail datais not\n13\nconfigured to straightforwardlyanswer the questions for which answers are needed\n14\nto determine class composition. Code has to be written to take all ofthose factors\n15\ninto account. Then the analysis has to be discussedbetween Plaintiffs and\n16\n17 Defendants, in orderto work out agreement on the data issues. All ofthis occurred\n18 here.\n19 There are relatively few attorneys qualifiedto handle the dataissues in a\n20 case suchas this to the maximum degree ofeffectiveness. When Mr. Barrett Litt\n21 came into the case, Plaintiffs had not yet undertaken an independentdata analysis.\n22 AfterMr. Litt's entry, data consultants he hadused previously analyzed all the\n23 data. As a result, the class list changed. In addition, an entire group ofindividuals\n24 were identified for whom no determination couldbe made based on the available\n25\ndata as to whethertheywere strip searched. This is because, for the earlier partof\n26\nthe class period, the data only captured the lead charge, but there mayhavebeen a\n!\n27\nI secondary ยง11550 charge onthe basis ofwhichthe arrestee was strip searched.\nI\n28\nI\n6\n\nCa e 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 7 of 14\n1\nThe solution to this problemwas developed through the use ofthe Possible Class\n2\nMember mailing.\n3\nC. The Risks OfNon-Payment Assumed By Counsel and Preclusion\n4 ofOther Employment\n5 Plaintiffs' counsel faced a substantial risk ofnon-payment, in part because\n6 counsel took this caseon a contingencyfee basis. Obviously, the Countyhad the\n7 resources to payajudgment. However, the risk lay in establishing thatthe\n8 County's policies were illegal. As discussed previously, strip searchlitigation in\n9 general is inherently riskybecause ofthe deference givenjail officials, andbecause\n10 there is a split in circuits developing. Seeking large amounts ofmoney from\n11 government entities always carries risks ofpolitics entering into the equation.\n12 Declarations filed in support ofPlaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees from\n13 experienced class and civil rights lawyers noted several particulardifficulties in\n14 litigationofthis kind, including 1)particularchallenges and expertise exist to\n15 establish a policyorcustomunderMonell v. Dept. Soc. Serv., 436 U.S. 658, 690\n16 (1978); 2) great deference is given tojails in addressing securityissues; 3) the law\n17 often differs from circuit to circuit; and 4) there is a greater riskthan normal that\n18 the whole legal landscape could changebyvirtue ofa change in the law,\n19 particularlyifthe SupremeCourtaddresses the issue (which it has not done in the\n20 area ofstrip searches ofpre-trial detainees sinceBellv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520\n21 (1979), almost 30 years ago. TheCourt agrees that all ofthese reflect risks for\n22\nPlaintiffs' counsel inpursuing litigationofthis type.\n23\nClass counsel, particularlyMr. Earnest Bell, declinedsubstantial otherwork\n24\nto pursue this case. These two cases combined (Way and Gamino) spannedmany\n25\nyears when the outcomewas uncertain. Over2000 hours were devoted to the\n26\ncombined Way and Gamino cases.\n27\n28\n7\n\nCa e2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 8of 14\n1\nD. The Result Obtained ForThe Class\n2\nThis case was hard fought. The Way case, in which thekey merits issues\n3\nwere fought out, went through extensive briefing in this Courtand theNinth\n4\nCircuit. The Plaintiffs were individuals oflittle means. All the workwas\n5\nperformed on a contingent fee basis. The settlement was the result ofarm's length\n6\nnegotiations enteredonlyafter Plaintiffwon the Way case. Even then it required\n7\nover a year ofsettlement efforts, and the addition ofMr. Litt to Plaintiffs' attorney\n8\nteam, to reach a settlement.\n9\nThe financial terms ofthe settlement arevery favorable to class members.\n10\n11 Those not charged with crimes ofviolence orinvolving otherdrug charges receive\n12 $2300 for a first offense and $700 for a secondoffense. This is considerably\n13 higherthan the average recoveryin otherstrip search class actions. (See B. Litt\n14 Dec. at ~ 35, [Doc. No. 176], filed concurrently with Plaintiffs' Motion.) While\n15 this ispartlyexplained by the scaleofthe othercases compared to this one, the fact\n16 remains that class members are receivingveryfavorable payments. In addition,\n17 eventhose charged with other drug charges orcrimes ofviolenceare participating\n18 in the settlement, eventhoughthe law inthis Circuit is that such charges provide\n19 reasonable suspicion to strip searchpre-arraignment arrestees. All ofthis is due\n20 exclusivelyto Class Counsel's efforts.\n21 Nor canthe results inthis casebejudged solelyby the monetary component\n22 ofthe settlement. As aresult ofthe combined Way and Gamino litigation, the\n23 County long ago ceased all ofthe strip searchpractices addressed in this\n24 settlement. Thatis a major accomplishment, particularly in lightofthe standing\n25 limitations imposedon suchcases. Thus, as a result ofClass Counsel's efforts,\n26 tens ofthousands offuture inmates havebeen sparedthe \"embarrassing and\n27 humiliating experience\", and\"extensive intrusion onpersonal privacy\", that a strip\n28\n8\n\nCa e 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 9 of 14\n1\nsearch, \"regardless ofhow professionally and courteouslyconducted\", necessarily\n2\nentails. Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668,674 (8th Cir.l982).\n3\nE. Experience, Reputation and Ability ofClass Counsel\n4\nClass Counsel are highly experience litigators in the fields ofcivil rights and\n5\nclass actions. Mr. Litt is widelyknown as oneofthe foremost civil rights attorneys\n6\nin California, having a particularexpertise in civil rights class actions and other\n7\ncomplex multi-party civil rights cases, especially law enforcementclass actions.\n8\nHe has both spoken and published on the issueofstrip search:and law enforcement\n9\n10 class actions at some length, and is counselin several otherpending class actions,\n11 both in California, and in other parts ofthe country (Washington, D.C., Baltimore\n12 and Atlanta). In addition, he has several $1 Millionplus civil rights trial verdicts,\n13 including a $22.5 Million verdict against the CityofLong Beach, which is the\n14 largest FairHousing verdict onrecord. He has settled three strip search class\n15 actions for eight figure sums, aside from this one. (See Dec. ofB. Littat\" 1-12,\n16 and his curriculumvitae attached as Exhibit 1.)\n17 Mr. Bell is an experiencedcivil rights litigator, who has practicedprimarily\n18 inVentura County, andhas beenthe mostprominentplaintiffs' police abuse\n19 attorney in Ventura Countyfor many years. He litigatedthe Way case through the\n20 Ninth Circuit and settlement. In addition, Mr. Bell litigated the first partofthe\n21 Gamino case andbroughtin Mr. Litt when he determined that the settlement\n22 process wouldbe aided bya civil rights lawyer experienced in class actions.\n23 F. TheReaction OfThe Class\n24 The reaction ofthe class was very favorable. There were no objections to\n25 the settlement. There were only five opt-outs (which is approximately 1/10 of1%).\n26 Over 1000 ClaimForms were timely filed.\n27\n28\n9\n\nCa 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 10 of 14\n1\nG. $1,400,000 Is A Reasonable Fee In This Case\n2\nIn this case, Plaintiffs' counsel seek an award of$1.4 Million, in addition to\n3\nthe $500,000 received in the Way case. This encompasses both fees and costs.\n4\n(Costs are relativelymodest, totaling under $15,000, which includes all the\n5\nspecialized data workperformedbyconsultants retainedby Plaintiffs.) The table\n6\nbelow reflects the lodestarcalculation for Plaintiffs' counsel's work inthis case.\n7\nAttorne~ Houd~ Rate Hours Total\n8\nEarnest Bell $600 1,602.50 $961,500.00\n9 Barrett S. Litt $750 187 $140,250.00\nCharlaGray $275 5.3 $1,457.50\n10\nJulia White $235 37 $8,695.00\n11 Total $1,111,902.50\n12 The rates usedhere are reasonable. Mr. Bell and Mr. Litt havebeen\n13 attorneys since 1988 and 1970, respectively. (Dec. ofB. Litt at~ 3; Dec. ofE. Bell\n14 at~ 2, attached as Exhibit 2 to Dec. ofB. Litt.) Combined, theyhave 60 years'\n15 litigation experience. Mr. Bell, an attorney with 21 years' experience, isthe\n16 leading plaintiffs' police practices civil rights attorney in Ventura County. (Dec.\n17\nofE. Bell at~~2,5.) Overthe last several years, police misconduct cases have\n18\ncomprised about 90% ofhis practice. (Id. at ~ 5.) Mr. Litt has 38 years'\n19\nexperience and forthe last 25-30 years has focused his practice on complex civil\n20\nlitigation in the areas ofconstitutional law, civil rights law, class action litigation\n21\nand complex multi-party litigation. (Dec. ofB. Litt at~ 3.) Inthe area ofclass\n22\nactions againstjails for violation ofcivil rights involving strip searches,\n23\nspecifically, Mr. Littis consideredone ofthe leading plaintiffs' lawyers in the\n24\ncountry. (Id. at ~ 8.) The rates used byMr. Bell and Mr. Litt are comparable to\n25\nLos Angeles market rates for complex litigation. (See id. at~~ 10-21; Dec. ofE.\n26\n27 Bell at ~ II.)\nIn addition, numerous declarations havebeen filed that were submittedin\n28\nCraft v. County a/San Bernardino, 2008 WL 916965 (C.D.Cal. April 01, 2008),\n10\n\nCa 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 11 of 14\n1\nestablishing the reasonableness ofthese rates, and those declarations are a year out\n2\nofdate. Mr. Litt also submitted a declaration establishing that his then current\n3\nrates have frequently been awarded by courts, and that the rates here reflect his\n4\nfirm's current rates.\n5\nIn Craft, DistrictJudge StephenLarson, using 2007 rates, found that \"rates\n6\nranging from a high of$725 perhour for Mr. Litt to a low of$275 for 2006\n7\ngraduates, as well as law clerk rates of$200 perhour and paralegal rates from a\n8\n9 low of$110 to a high of$225 perhour\" were \"supportedbynumerous\n10 declarations... establish[ing] that thehourly rates set are similar to those for\n11 attorneys ofcomparable skill and experience at the rates paid for complex federal\n12 litigation\" and that \"the rates soughtare reasonable and reflectthe market for\n13 attorneys ofcomparable skill, experience and expertise in complex federal\n14 litigation.\" Craft, 2008 WL 916965 at 9. Judge Larsonalso noted that it \"was\n15 Congress' intent for civil rights cases [to usethe standard ofcomplexlitigationin\n16 setting civil rights fee rates]. See City a/Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 575 \n17 576 (1986) (quoting SenateReport, at 6, U.S. Code Congo & Admin. News 1976,\n18 p. 5913, supra, (Congress intended civil rights fees to becomparableto that for\n19 'othertypes ofequally complex Federal litigation, such as antitrust cases').\" Id.\n20 Plaintiffs anticipatethat the lodestar will increase byapproximately\n21 $100,000 plus in the courseofthe remaining work on the case, including work\n22 between now andthe settlement and work over the ensuingperiod through the final\n23 distribution ofthe funds. (Thepost-settlement workis expectedto be somewhat\n24 extensive due to theprocessofdeciding issues suchas which possible class\n25 members are in fact class members, lien issues andthe like). Thus, the total\n26 lodestar is approximately$1.2 Million. The total fee award, including the\n27 $500,000 awarded in Way, is $1.9 Million, which wouldresultin a multiplierof\n28 approximately 1.6 ($1.2M x 1.6 = $1.9M).\n11\n\nCa 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 12of 14\n1\nThis is a modestmultiplier. Many class action cases have authorized far\n2\nhigher multipliers. See, e.g., Craft v.

See also cases citedinthe Appendix in Vizcaino v.\n17 Microsoft Corp., 290 F3d 1043 (9th Cir. 2002) (containing several cases with\n18 multipliers ofthree and higher).\n19 In this case, Plaintiffs' counsel obtained a relatively expeditious and\n20 \"excellent result\" in a \"complex and risky case\".

The\n23 \"skill and experience brought to bearbycounsel throughout the year[s] they spent\n24 actively litigating this case, and the economy with which they were able to achieve\n25 such a noteworthy settlement\" all speakto a substantial fee award.

Awarding Fees and Costs Requested Advances the Purposes of\n1\nClass Actions in the Context ofThis Settlement\n2\nBecause ofthe structure ofthe settlement agreement, the $1,400,000\n3\nallocated to fees and costs is separate from the individual class members' recovery,\n4\ni.e., class members will not receive more ifa lowerfee is awarded. An important\n5\npurpose ofthe class action device is that defendants should notbenefit from their\n6\nwrongdoing, and should be deterred from doing so bybeing vulnerable to class\n7\nactions to remedytheirwrongful conduct. See, e.g., Richard A. Posner, Economic\n8\n9 Analysis ofLaw 626-27 (5th ed. 1998) (\"the most important point from an\n10 economic standpoint is that the violatorbeconfronted with the costs ofhis\nviolation-this achieves the allocativepurpose ofthe suit-not that he pays them to\n11\n12 his victims\").\n13 Through the deterrenceprism, the defendants would receive anunjustified\n14 windfall ifthe requested fees were not granted infull. In addition, it is important\n15 to provide appropriate incentives for attorneys to undertake the risk ofclass\n16 litigation. To the extent they are not properlyawardedwhen they are successful,\n17 that undermines the deterrent purpose ofthe class action mechanism. As recent\n18 commentators have observed, ifthe economic interests ofthe class and counsel are\n19 misaligned, class counsel lose the incentive to maximize the benefit to the class\n20 because they do notparticipate, or do not fully participate, in the benefit ofa larger\n21 recovery. See, e.g., MyriamGilles, Exploding The ClassActionAgency Costs\n22 Myth: The Social Utility OfEntrepreneurialLawyers, UniversityofPennsylvania\n23 Law Review, 155 U. Pa. L. Rev. 103 (November 2006).\n24 CONCLUSION\n25 Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion for\n26 Attorneys' Fees. Defendants are ordered to payClass Counsel attorneys' fees and\n27\n28\n13\n\nCa 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 185 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 14of 14\n1\ncosts in the amount of$1,400,000 pursuant to Paragraph ~ 26 oftheparties'\n2\nSettlementAgreement [Doc.

PAYMENTSTO THE CLASS BYTHE DEFENDANTS\n19\n17. As set forth inmore detail inthe SettlementAgreement, the\n20 Defendants agreed to payall class members who file claims on the following\n21 tenns.\n22 a. TIER 1: A Tier 1 SCM is a class member who was Strip Searched\n23 during the Class Period and at the time ofthe booking was charged with\n24 an offense concerning weapons or violence in addition to violation of\n25 H&S ยง11550. An SCM who qualifies under Tier 1shall receive a one \n26 time onlysumof$250 (Two Hundred FiftyDollars).\n27 b. TIER 2: A Tier 2 SCM is a class member who was Strip Searched\n28\n8\n\nC e 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 186 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 9 of 71\n1 during the Class Period and at the time ofthe booking was charged with\n2 an offense relating to a drug or narcotics offense in addition to violation\n3 of H&Sยง11550. An SCM who qualifies under Tier 2 shall receive a\n4 one-time onlysum of$650 (Six HundredFiftyDollars).\n5 c. TIER 3: A Tier 3 SCM is a class member who was Strip Searched\n6 during the Class Period and at the time ofthe booking was charged with\n7 H&S ยง11550, but not with any weapons, violence or drug charges. For\n8 purposes ofclaims administration, a list ofweapons, violence and drugs\n9 charges are set forth in Exhibit F to the Proposed Preliminary Approval\n10 Order, [Doc. No. 171], and will be provided to the Class Administrator.\n11 An SCM who qualifies underTier3 shall receive a one-time only sum of\n12 $2,300 (Two Thousand Three Hundred Dollars).\nd. TIER 3, SECOND SEARCH: An SCM who qualifies for a payment\n13\nunder Tier 3 as set forth in the preceding paragraph 13(c), and was\n14\nsubjected to a second separate and distinct arrest, booking and Strip\n15\nSearch during the Class Period that qualifies as a Tier 3 Search, shall\n16\nreceive a one-time only payment of$700 for the second search.\n17\ne. Defendants shall not be liable to pay for any additional Strip Search to\n18\nwhich an SCM was subjected. Byway ofillustration and for example, if\n19\nan SCM was arrested three separate times during the Class Period and\n20\neach ofthe three Strip Searches qualifyunder Tier 3, the SCM would be\n21\nentitled to a single Tier 3 payment in accordance with paragraph 13(c),\n22\nand a single second search payment in accordance with paragraph 13(d),\n23\nand no otherpayment.\n24\nf. An SCM maynot qualifyin more than one ofthe threetiers and an SCM\n25\nshall not be entitled to receive a payment from more than one of three\n26\ntiers. If an SCM qualifies for more than one of the three tiers as set\n27\n28\n9\n\nCa e 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 186 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 10 of71\n1 forth, above, Defendants agree to pay such SCM from the highest payout\n2 tier for which the SCM otherwise qualifies. By way of illustration and\n3 for example, ifan SCM was arrested twice during the Class Period and\n4 qualifies for payment in Tier 1 for the first Strip Search and Tier 2 for\n5 the second Strip Search, the SCM, who otherwise qualifies for payment\n6 under the SettlementAgreement, would be qualified to receive $650, the\n7 higher of the two qualifying payouts. Under no circumstances will\n8 Defendants beobligatedto make payment underboth tiers.\n9 g. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the Effective Date for Payment, the\n10 Defendants shall have deposited with the Class Administrator the sums\n11 necessary to pay all claims made and approved to date. Defendants shall\n12 continue to provide on an ongoing basis such sums as maybe required to\n13 continue to pay approved claims until all such claims are paid or\n14 determinednot to qualify for payment.\n15 XII. NAMED PLAINTIFFS'DISTRIBUTION\n16 18. The Courtawards each ofthe three class representatives - Juan\n17 Gamino, Kathy Conleyand Ed Ferrel-$50,000. The class representatives will not\n18 otherwiseparticipate inthe claims processinvolving SCMs orreceive any other\n19 payment underthe terms ofthis SettlementAgreement.\n20 19. The Courtconcludes that this award isjustifiedbecausetheNamed\n21 Plaintiffs made contributionsto the class as awhole,justifying awards to them\n22 higher than those to the general class. In addition, theNamed Plaintiffs'\n23 individualized damages claims, including special damages, are afactor in the\n24 determination ofthe sumthey receive. Such determinations caunot reasonablybe\n25 made for class members in general without unduly consuming funds for\n26 administrative costs that will otherwisebe available for distributionto Class\n27 members. Any fees due Class Counsel for theirrepresentation oftheNamed\n28\n10\n\nCa 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 186 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 11 of 71\n1 Plaintiffs are encompassed within the Class Fund Attorneys' Fees referenced\n2 herein.\n3 XIII.

This payment represents a\n7 full and final settlement ofall past, present and future attorneys' fees and all past,\n8 present and future ordinary and extraordinarycosts. It shall bepaid as specifiedin\ntJ\n9 22, infra.\n10 21. The Court has reviewed the Plaintiffs' counsel's claimfor attorneys'\n11 fees and fmds them well withinthe acceptedrange for class fund fees. Including\n12 the fees paid to class counsel for Way v. County o/Ventura, the total fees and costs\n13 paid to class counsel, including the fees herein, is under $2 Million. The lodestar,\n14 based oninformationprovidedthe Court, is approximately $1.2 Million.\n15 22. The Court fmds theparties' agreementregarding attorneys' fees and\n16 costs to be reasonable, and awards therequested fees and costs. It addresses the\n17 issue in a separate orderapproving the fees and cost requestedherein.\n18 XIV. FORM OF PAYMENTOFNAMED PLAINTIFFS'DISTRIBUTION\n19 ANDATTORNEYS'FEES\n20 23.

WhyIsThisAClassAction?\nIn a class action, one or morepersons, called the Class Representative(s), sue on behalfofa group ofpeople\nwhohave similarclaims- theClassMembers. One courtthenresolves the issues forall ClassMembers, exceptfor\nthosewhoexcludethemselvesfromtheclass.\n5. WhyIsThereA Settlement?\nThis casehasbeen going onfor averylong time. Instead ofcontinuing with the case, bothsideshaveagreed\nto a settlement. That way, both sides are able to avoid the risks and costs of a trial or appeal, the case can be\nresolved immediately, and thebenefits ofthe Settlementcan bemade immediatelyavailable to the ClassMembers.\nTheClassRepresentativesandtheirattorneysthinkthattheproposedSettlementisfair totheClassMembers andthe\nparties in the case and think that the terms ofthe Settlement are a fair, reasonable and adequate resolution ofthis\nmatter. Becausethisisa settlement, theDefendantsdonotformally admitliability,buttheynonetheless agreetopay\nmoneytoclassmembersunderthetermsofthesettlement.\n2\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E Document 186 Filed 02/05/2009 Page 60 of 71\n6.

For purposes of \n14 claims administration, a list of weapons, violence and drugs charges are set forth in \n15 Exhibit F and will be provided to the Administrator.  Defendants agree to pay an \n16 SCM who qualifies under the terms of this Settlement Agreement in Tier 3, a one-\n17 time only payment of $2,300 [Two Thousand Three Hundred Dollars]. \n18   D.  TIER 3, SECOND SEARCH:  Defendants agree to pay an SCM \n19 who qualifies for a payment under Tier 3 as set forth in Paragraph 27(C), above, \n20 and was subjected to a second separate and distinct arrest, booking and Strip Search \n21 during the Class Period that qualifies as a Tier 3 Search, a one-time only payment \n22 of  $700  for  the  second  search.    Defendants  shall  not  be  liable  to  pay  for  any \n23 additional Strip Search to which an SCM was subjected.  By way of illustration and \n24 for example, if an SCM was arrested three separate times during the Class Period \n25 and  each  of  the  three  Strip  Searches  qualify  under  Tier  3,  the  SCM  would  be \n26 entitled to a single Tier 3 payment in accordance with Paragraph 27(C) and a single \n27 second search payment in accordance with Paragraph 27(D) and no other payment. \n28 28. An SCM is limited to a one time only payment from one of the three \n10\nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n24\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 171-2      Filed 07/25/2008     Page 12 of 22\n1 tiers identified in Paragraph 27, above.  An SCM may not qualify in more than one \n2 of the three tiers and an SCM shall not be entitled to receive a payment from more \n3 than one of three tiers.  If an SCM qualifies for more than one of the three tiers as \n4 set forth, above, Defendants agree to pay such SCM from the highest payout tier for \n5 which the SCM otherwise qualifies.  By way of illustration and for example, if an \n6 SCM was arrested twice during the Class Period and qualifies for payment in Tier 1 \n7 for the first Strip Search and Tier 2 for the second Strip Search, the SCM, who \n8 otherwise qualifies for payment under the Settlement Agreement, would be \n9 qualified to receive $650, the higher of the two qualifying payouts.  Under no \n10 circumstances would Defendants be obligated to make payment under both tiers. \n11 CLASS COUNSEL FEES\n12 29. Released Parties shall pay a one-time only lump sump payment of \n13 $1,400,000 (One Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars) issued jointly to Class \n14 Counsel.  This payment represents a full and final settlement of all past, present and \n15 future attorneysโ fees and all past, present and future ordinary and extraordinary \n16 costs.  It shall be paid as specified in ยถ26, supra.\n17 CLASS ADMINISTRATION COSTS\n18 30. Up to $250,000 (Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars) will be paid \n19 by Released Parties for all claims administration costs.  Claims administration costs \n20 shall be limited to the costs of claims administration, costs of class notice and costs \n21 for a Special Master as set forth in this Settlement Agreement.  Defendants and the \n22 County of Venturaโs insurers had the unilateral right to decline entering into the \n23 Settlement Agreement if they determined that claims administration costs would \n24 exceed $250,000.  This unilateral right to decline expired on April 15, 2008 and the \n25 Defendants and the County of Venturaโs insurers did not exercise the right, which \n26 right has now expired.  Claims administration costs will be paid separately from the \n27 amounts paid to SCMs and separately from Class Counselโs fees and costs as set \n28 forth in Paragraph 29.   \n11\nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n25\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 171-2      Filed 07/25/2008     Page 13 of 22\n1 CLASS NOTIFICATION\n2 31. The  Administrator  shall  be  responsible  for  providing  Class  Notice.  \n3 This  shall  comprise  mailing  notice  by  regular  mail  to  the  SCMsโ  last  known \n4 address.  The Administrator shall also use normal and customary means to search \n5 for an SCMโs last known address, including the use of a postal database.  The Class \n6 Notice  shall  describe  the  particulars  of  the  case,  provide  the  class  definition, \n7 provide information for claimants to contact the Administrator for a claims form \n8 and other usual and customary information.  A Class Notice is attached to this \n9 Settlement Agreement as Exhibit C. Class counsel Earnest Bell shall be provided an \n10 initial set of 200 claim forms, and more as requested, to provide to persons seeking \n11 claim forms from him. \n12 32. The  Administrator  shall  complete  the  mailing  of  Class  Notice  and \n13 Claim  Information  Letters,  as  set  forth  in  Paragraphs  31  and  34,  within  two \n14 consecutive business days. The first day of such mailing is the first day of the \n15 period for calculating the โbar dateโ as provided in ยถ 2. \n16 33. The Administrator shall be responsible for publishing Class Notice as \n17 follows:\n18 A.  Los Angeles Times, editions covering from San Luis Obispo in \n19 the North to Los Angeles in the South.  The notice shall run on four separate days a \n20 week apart over a four week period and shall be at least 1/8 page in size. \n21   B.  Ventura County Star.  The notice shall run on four separate days \n22 a week apart over a four week period and shall be at least ยผ page in size. \n23   C.  Ventura County Cable TV Community Bulletin Board.  Provide \n24 a notice announcement for four days. \n25 CLAIM INFORMATION LETTER TO POSSIBLE SCMs\n26 34. The  Administrator  shall  be  responsible  for  sending  a  Claim \n27 Information Letter to Possible Settlement Class Members, based on an agreed upon \n28 list  of  Possible  Settlement  Class  Members  that  will  be  provided  to  the \n12\nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n26\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 171-2      Filed 07/25/2008     Page 14 of 22\n1 Administrator  by  Class  Counsel  and  Counsel  for  Defendants.    This  Claim \n2 Information Letter will be in addition to the Class Notice, Claim Form and any \n3 other materials sent to already identified SCMs. The Claim Information Letter shall \n4 be sent by first class mail to the last known address for the Possible Settlement \n5 Class Member as contained in the Computer System. The Claim Information Letter \n6 will  advise  the  Possible  Settlement  Class  Members  that  the  Computer  System \n7 indicates  an  arrest  during  the  Claim  Period,  but  does  not  reflect  a  charge  for \n8 violation of H&S ยง11550.  The Claim Information Letter will advise the Possible \n9 Settlement Class Member that, to make a claim as an SCM, they must complete and \n10 sign a Proof of Claim Form and that it must be their good faith best recollection, \n11 under penalty of perjury, that they were charged with H&S ยง11550 at the time of \n12 arrest during the Claim Period and that they were subjected to a Strip Search.  The \n13 Claim Information Letter will further advise the Possible Settlement Class Member \n14 that  the  Defendants  and/or  Administrator  may  review  the  arrest  files  of  these \n15 Possible Settlement Class Member to verify any claim made.  A copy of the Claim \n16 Information Letter form is attached as Exhibit D.  The timely filing of a Proof of \n17 Claim by a Possible Settlement Class Member shall qualify that Possible Settlement \n18 Class Member to receive payment of his or her claim regardless of the length of \n19 time required to determine whether s/he is in fact an actual SCM who is entitled to \n20 payment under this Agreement. \n21 35. The  Administrator  shall  report  all  Proof  of  Claim  Forms  filed  by \n22 Possible Settlement Class Members within 10 days from the Bar Date to Class \n23 Counsel and Counsel for Defendants.  The VCSD shall then cause the arrest records \n24 for those Possible Settlement Class Members to be retrieved for further review \n25 (โArrest Recordsโ).  If the VCSD determines that the Possible Settlement Class \n26 Memberโs records indicate a charge of violation of H&S ยง11550 at the time of the \n27 relevant arrest and Strip Search, it shall so advise the Administrator, Class Counsel \n28 and Defendantโs counsel.  The Administrator shall then treat that claimant as an \n13\nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n27\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 171-2      Filed 07/25/2008     Page 15 of 22\n1 SCM, subject to the terms of this Settlement Agreement.  If the VCSD concludes \n2 that the Possible Class Memberโs records do not include a charge for violation of \n3 H&S ยง11550, it shall provide copies of those records to the Administrator, Class \n4 Counsel and Defendantโs counsel.\n5 36. Upon receipt of the Arrest Records, the Administrator, Class Counsel \n6 and Defendantโs counsel shall meet and confer by telephone or in person.  For \n7 purposes of this section, each of the three shall have a single vote.  If all agree that \n8 the Arrest Records include a charge of H&S ยง11550, the Possible Settlement Class \n9 Member  claimant  shall  be  considered  an  SCM,  subject  to  the  terms  of  this \n10 Settlement Agreement.  If all agree that the Arrest Records do not include a charge \n11 of  H&S  ยง11550,  the  Administrator  shall  provide  written  notice  to  the  Possible \n12 Settlement Class Member claimant that he/she does not qualify as an SCM.  The \n13 written notice of rejection shall also provide the Possible Settlement Class Member \n14 with information regarding the right to appeal the decision to a Special Master as \n15 set forth in this Settlement Agreement.  If the Administrator, Class Counsel and \n16 Counsel for Defendants cannot unanimously agree, the matter shall be submitted to \n17 the Special Master pursuant to the Dispute Resolution provisions set forth in this \n18 Settlement Agreement. \n19 37. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  in  Paragraphs  34-36,  above, \n20 Defendants, in their sole discretion, may elect to treat any submitted claim from a \n21 Possible Settlement Class Member as if the Arrest Records contained a charge for \n22 violation  of  H&S  ยง11550  and  instruct  the  Administrator  to  treat  such  Possible \n23 Settlement  Class  Member  as  an  SCM,  subject  to  all  other  provisions  of  this \n24 Settlement Agreement.\n25 CLASS ADMINISTRATION FOR PROOF OF CLAIM FORMS\n26 38. The  Administrator  shall  be  responsible  for  providing  and  receiving \n27 Proof of Claim Forms.  The Administrator shall determine eligibility for and the \n28 amount of payment based on the Database or other available County of Ventura \n14\nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n28\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 171-2      Filed 07/25/2008     Page 16 of 22\n1 documents provided by Defendants to the Administrator.  The Class Administrator \n2 shall email a report in electronic format every 15 days from the time notice is sent \n3 until  the  claims  process  is  completed  to  all  counsel  providing  the  following \n4 information regarding filed claims: name of claimant; date of birth of claimant; \n5 postmark date of claimantโs claim; whether the claimant is an identified or possible \n6 class member; and the amount, if determined, to which the claimant is entitled.. \n7 39. A Proof of Claim and Release Form shall be deemed timely submitted \n8 when received by the Administrator, or postmarked, on or before the Bar Date.  \n9 Facsimile or electronic mail filings are not acceptable, will be deemed untimely \n10 filed and shall not be considered by the Administrator.  \n11 40. A Proof of Claim Form which does not meet the requirements set forth \n12 in this Settlement Agreement or is otherwise determined to be deficient or untimely \n13 by the Administrator will be preliminarily rejected by the Administrator. \n14 41. If the Administrator rejects a claim, it shall provide written notice by \n15 First Class  Mail and a 30-day time limit to provide an opportunity for the claimant \n16 to submit evidence to support eligibility as an SCM.  Failure to timely respond to \n17 the Administratorโs notice of rejection will bar any further rights for consideration \n18 of eligibility.\n19 42. If the claimant timely provides additional information following the \n20 Administratorโs notice of rejection, the Administrator shall provide the additional \n21 information to Class Counsel and counsel for Defendants who shall either approve \n22 or disapprove the claim.  If Class Counsel and counsel for Defendants cannot agree, \n23 the  matter  shall  be  submitted  to  the  Special  Master  pursuant  to  the  Dispute \n24 Resolution procedures set forth in this Settlement Agreement. \n25 43. The Administrator will prepare a list of all rejected claims, with its \n26 reasons for rejection.  The list of rejected claims shall be provided to Class Counsel \n27 and counsel for Defendants within 15 days from the Bar Date. \n28 44. The Parties agree that untimely filed Proof of Claim Forms shall be \n15\nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n29\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 171-2      Filed 07/25/2008     Page 17 of 22\n1 preliminarily rejected by the Administrator and no payment shall be made.\n2 45. The Administrator shall be responsible for garnishing from any \n3 payment to an SCM certain amounts that the SCM owes for any liens or court \n4 orders for restitution, child support, debts owed to the County of Ventura and any \n5 statutory liens, as set forth in ยถ49, infra.\n6 46. The Administrator shall make payments to SCMs in accordance with \n7 this Settlement Agreement in two payment rounds.  The first round payment shall \n8 be paid to SCMs who, pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement, filed \n9 timely Proof of Claim and Release Forms and whose claims have been determined \n10 to be valid, within a reasonable time not to exceed 120 days after the Effective \n11 Date.  The second round payment shall be paid within 90 days after the date of the \n12 first  round  payment.    Should  there  remain  unresolved  claims  at  that  time,  the \n13 Administrator shall pay these on an individual basis as they become resolved and a \n14 determination is made that payment is owed under the terms of this Settlement \n15 Agreement.  \n16 47. The Administrator shall not make payment to any SCM until all claims \n17 have been submitted to the Administrator pursuant to the terms of this Settlement \n18 Agreement. \n19 GARNISHMENT OF PAYMENT FOR LIENS\n20 48. The  Administrator  shall  deduct  from  any  claim  certain  payment \n21 amounts owed by a claim participant for any liens or court orders for restitution, \n22 child support, debts to county and statutory liens.  The Claims Administrator will \n23 make payment to the County, the proper payee and/or their designee for those \n24 payment amounts deducted as set forth in this paragraph. The defendants shall \n25 prepare a list of the liens or orders applicable to each class member (hereafter \n26 referred to collectively as โlienโ or โliensโ), and the parties shall meet and confer \n27 with respect to the list of such liens. The following procedures shall apply. \n28 a. For those for whom there is a claim that they owe an amount as described \n16\nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n30\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 171-2      Filed 07/25/2008     Page 18 of 22\n1 above, the payment disbursement letter accompanying any claim check \n2 sent to them shall include a notice of that amount, specifying the nature of \n3 the lien and the purported amount of the lien. The notice shall include \n4 advising the claimant of his or her right to contest the lien through a \n5 Special Master and advise him of the procedures to do so (the full extent \n6 of  which  will  be  elaborated  in  a  final  settlement  agreement  and/or \n7 Settlement Approval Order). \n8 b. The  Special  Master  agreed  to  pursuant  to  ยถ55  will  be  empowered  to \n9 resolve any lien disputes under this paragraph. To participate as a class \n10 member, any claimant with liens will be deemed to have agreed that the \n11 Special Masterโs determination shall be binding and non-appealable. Such \n12 a claimant may present his or her contentions and supporting documents \n13 in  writing  to  the  Special  Master.  Each  sideโs  counsel  will  make  a \n14 recommendation to the Special Master, who will then decide. \n15 c. Despite the amount of any lien, no claimant shall have to pay more than \n16 50% of his/her class fund payment towards the lien, which ensures that \n17 the claimant will receive funds for his/her claim regardless of the amount \n18 of any lien.\n19 EXCLUSION FROM SETTLEMENT CLASSโOPT OUTS \n20 49. Any Settlement Class Member who wishes to be excluded from the \n21 Settlement Class must submit a request to be excluded from the class, defined \n22 herein  as  โOpt-Outโ.    The  request  for  exclusion  must  be  delivered  to  the \n23 Administrator,  or  postmarked,  on  or  before  the  Bar  Date  or  as  the  Court  may \n24 otherwise direct.\n25 50. Each member of the Settlement Class who chooses to Opt-Out from or \n26 object to this settlement shall be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the \n27 Court with respect to his/her claim and to any dispute resolution process conducted \n28 by a special master as set forth in this Settlement Agreement. \n17\nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n31\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 171-2      Filed 07/25/2008     Page 19 of 22\n1 51. Any Settlement Class Member who does not Opt-Out as set forth in \n2 this Settlement Agreement, shall be deemed conclusively to have become an SCM \n3 and to be bound by the Settlement Agreement and all subsequent proceedings, \n4 orders and judgments herein.   \n5 52. Any SCM who exercises an Opt-Out, as set forth in Paragraph 49, \n6 shall not share in any monetary benefits provided by this Settlement Agreement. \n7 53. The  Administrator  will  report  to  Defendantโs  counsel  and  Class \n8 Counsel all Out-Outs upon receipt, and will determine and report to counsel the \n9 total number of Opt-Outs no later than 10 days after the Bar Date.  If the total \n10 number of Opt-Outs exceeds 25, Defendants, in their sole discretion, may rescind \n11 their acceptance of the Settlement Agreement.  Defendants, in exercising this right \n12 of rescission, shall provide the Administrator and Class Counsel with written notice \n13 of rescission within 20 days after receipt of the Administratorโs report providing the \n14 total number of Opt-Outs.  In the event Defendants exercise their right of rescission \n15 in accordance with this paragraph, any funds paid or deposited pursuant to this \n16 Settlement  Agreement  shall  be  returned  to  Defendants  within  10  days  of  the \n17 exercise of the right to rescind, less any expenses, fees and costs incurred by the \n18 Administrator. \n19 DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n20 54. The Parties agree to the appointment of the Honorable Raul Ramirez \n21 (Ret.) as Special Master pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 53 to \n22 resolve disputes that arise from implementation of the Settlement Agreement as set \n23 forth herein.\n24 INTEGRATION\n25\n55.

This  Settlement  Agreement  and  any \n17\nproceedings  taken  pursuant  hereto  shall  not  in  any  event  be  construed  as, \n18\ninterpreted as, or deemed to be evidence of an admission or concession by either \n19\nparty for any purpose, or deemed to constitute a waiver of any legal position or any \n20\ndefenses or other rights which either of the parties might otherwise assert in any \n21\ncontext.  Neither this Settlement Agreement nor any of its provisions nor any other \n22\ndocuments related hereto nor any negotiations, statements or testimony taken in \n23\nconnection herewith may be offered or received in evidence in, or used for any \n24\nother purpose, or in any suit, action or legal proceeding which either of them may \n25\nnow  have  or  in  the  future  have  with  any  other  person,  as  an  admission  or \n26\nconcession of liability or wrongdoing or as any admission or concession on the part \n27\nof either party, except in connection with any action or legal proceeding to enforce \n28\n19\nCLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n33\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 171-2      Filed 07/25/2008     Page 21 of 22\n1 this Settlement Agreement.  The Parties have reached this Settlement Agreement on \n2 a commercial basis through arms-length negotiations and to avoid the costs and \n3 delays  of  further  disputes,  litigation  and  negotiations  among  them.

Marshall, Chief Judge, presiding. \n22  Upon consideration of the papers and arguments submitted, the Court \n23  DENIES Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and DENIES Plaintiffs \n24  request for a finding as to class size. \n25  JURISDICTION \n26  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343. \n27  BACKGROUND \nDOCi<.Em ) NC M \nPI  intiffs filed this class action complaint on December 24, 2002, alleging \nOf) \nh  /  1 \nBY  v  013  0-\n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 80      Filed 12/13/2004     Page 2 of 6\nconstitutional violations by Defendants as a result of the County of Ventura \nC_'I \nSheriffs Department's policy of strip searching all individuals booked into the \n2  I,~J \n,,~-,,.  \n3  County Jail for suspicion of being under the influence of a controlled substance5 \nij\"j \n4  This is a companion case to Way v.  Ventura COUllty, which alleges the same \n5  wrongdoing.  On July 22, 2002, this Court granted Way's Motion for Partial \n6  Summary Judgment, finding that  the visual unclothed body cavity search of \n7  Plaintiff, pursuant to the County's strip search policy, violated Plaintiffs Fourth \n8  Amendment rights.  On February 18,2004, this Court denied Defendants' Motion \n9  for Summary Judgment based on Qualified Immunity, finding that the law \n10  prohibiting the blanket search policy was clearly established at the time of the \n11  search,  Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal on March 4, 2004 and the case is \n12  currently pending with the Ninth Circuit \n13  Like Noelle Way, the named Plaintiffs in this case (Juan Gamino, Kathy \n14  Conley, and Ed Ferrel) were charged solely under California Health and Safety \n15  Code Section 11550 for being under the influence of a controlled substance, \n16  subjected to a strip search during the booking process, and subsequently were \n17  either released on their own recognizance or posted bail.  The named Plaintiffs \n18  never entered the general jail population. \n19  On September 4,2003, the parties in this lawsuit lodged a stipulation and \n20  proposed order certifying this case as a Rule 23(b )(3) class action and defining the \n21  class as \"[a]ny pretrial detainee in the Ventura County Jail for violation of Health \n22  and Safety Code Section 11550 so that, in accordance with the Ventura County \n23  Sheriff's Department's policy, each arrestee was subject to a visual-only unclothed \n24  body cavity examination,\"  The Court certified the class on September 17,2003. \n25  On August 30, 2004, the Court denied Defendants Motion to ModifY Class, \n26  rejecting Defendants' arguments that individuals who had been charged with \n27  additional offenses that may have justified a strip search or who had entered the \n28  general jail population should be excluded from the class.  On August 31, 2004, the \n2 \n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 80      Filed 12/13/2004     Page 3 of 6\nCourt Approved Plaintiffs' proposed notice of pendency of class action and ordered \nCj \n2  Plaintiff to notify the class. \nIlJ \n3  On September 13,2004, Plaintiffs filed this Motion for Summary Judgmerit. \n\\_,1 \n4  Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on two issues: (I) that Defendants violated  .J' \n5  California Civil Code Section 52 and 52.1 as to each member of the class; and (2) \n6  that the number of class members totals 4989.  Defendants filed an opposition on \n7  October 4,2004.  A reply was filed on October 12,2004. \n8  DISCUSSION \n9  A.  Standard of Law \n10  Summary judgment against a party is appropriate when  \"the pleadings, \n11  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the \n12  affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \n13  that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n14  56(c) (emphasis added).  A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial \n15  burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those \n16  portions of the pleadings and discovery responses which demonstrate the absence \n17  ofa genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v.  Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,323 \n18  (1986).  Where the nonmoving party will have the burden of proof at trial, the \n19  movant can prevail merely by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to \n20  support the nonmoving party's case.  See id.  If the moving party meets its initial \n21  burden, the nonmoving party must then set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise \n22  provided in Rule 56, \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for tria!.\" \n23  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e);  Anderson v.  Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986). \n24  In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the Court does not make \n25  credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence and draws all inferences in \n26  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  T. W.  Elec. Svc., Inc.  v. Pacific \n27  Elec. Contractors Ass 'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987).  The evidence \n28  presented by the parties must be admissible.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  Conclusory, \n3 \n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 80      Filed 12/13/2004     Page 4 of 6\nI  speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise \nCl \n2  genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment.  See Thornhill Pub. Co., l~f' \n3  v.  GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th CiT.  1979). \n4  B.  Analysis \n5  Plaintiffs set forth two issues for the Court to decide.  First, Plaintiffs request \n6  summary judgment as to the Third Cause of Action for Violation of California Civil \n7  Code Section 52.1.  Second, Plaintiffs request that the Court make a finding that the \n8  number of class members totals 4989. \n9  1.  California Civil Code Section 52.1 \n10  Plaintiffs' Third Cause of Action alleges that Defendants interfered with \nII  class members' exercise or enjoyment of constitutional rights by threats, \n12  intimidation, or coercion, in violation of Cal. Civil Code ยง52.1.  Cal. Civil Code \n13  ยง52.l provides for damages under Civil Code ยง52, which, in tum,  provides for \n14  damages \"up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no \n15  case less than four thousand dollars ($ 4,000), and any attorney's fees that may be \n16  determined by the court in addition thereto.\"  Plaintiffs contend that the remedies \n17  set forth in this section apply to the present case. \n18  In the companion case of Way v.  County a/Ventura, this Court held that the \n19  County's strip search policy violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment right to be free \n20  from unreasonable searches.  See Order of July 22, 2002.  However, the Court made \n21  no findings as to whether threats, intimidation or coercion had been used to conduct \n22  the strip searches.  Nor do Plaintiffs offer any evidence about the use of the threats, \n23  intimidation or coercion in this Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.  Plaintiffs \n24  simply assert that class members' rights were violated \"through intimidation and \n25  coercion with the threat of being incarcerated if they did not acquiesce to the \n26  mandatory strip/visual body cavity search.\"  The use of intimidation, coercion or \n27  threats is a separate element of Civil Code ยง52.1 that must be proven.  See, e.g., \n28  Jones v. Kmart Corp.,  17 Cal.4th 329, 338 (1988) (finding that, \"as long as \n4 \n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 80      Filed 12/13/2004     Page 5 of 6\n. \no \ninterference or attempted interference with [rights] is accompanied by threats, \nta \n2  intimidation, or coercion, section 52.1 provides remedies for that misconduct\"). \n3  Since the Court denies summary judgment as to the third cause of action based d~ \nC.I \n4  Plaintiffs fail to offer any evidence of intimidation, coercion or threats, the Court' \n5  need not reach the issue of whether ยง52.1 can be invoked in a class action and \n6  whether claims under this section may be brought in federal court. \n2.  Class Size \n7 \n8  Plaintiffs also request that the Court make a finding as to the size of the \n9  class.  Plaintiffs assert that there are 4989 class members.  Plaintiffs rely on the \n10  September 4,2003 deposition of Commander Mark Ball of the Ventura County \n11  Jail, which includes exhibits that specify the total booking including a charge of \n12  Section 11550 for each year from 1998 to 2003, as well as a booking count for \n13  Section 11550 arrests for each month from June 2002 to July 2003.  Since the class \nperiod is from December 24,2001 to March 27,2003, Plaintiffs estimate the \n14 \n15  number of persons booked during December 2001 and March 2003 by calculating \n16  the average number of people strip searched per day in each of these years. \n17  Defendants reject 4989 as the number of class members for several reasons. \n18  Defendants contend that persons who were convicted of additional offenses and \n19  those released into the general jail population should be excluded from the class. \n20  The Court rejected these arguments in denying Defendants' Motion to Amend the \n21  Class on August 30,2004.  However, Defendants also contend that the number of \n22  persons charged with a violation of Section 11550 who were strip searched at \n23  Ventura County Jail between December 24, 2001 and March 27,2003 was 4429, \n24  not 4989 as stated by Plaintiffs.  Defendants rely on the March 26, 2004 deposition \n25  of Renee Ferguson, who is a sergeant with the Ventura County Jail.  However, \n26  Defendants do not submit the underlying evidence that supports Ms. Ferguson's \n27  declaration.  Since there is a factual dispute as to the number of persons charged \n28  with Section 11550 violations who were strip searched during the class period, and \n5 \n\nCase 2:02-cv-09785-CBM-E     Document 80      Filed 12/13/2004     Page 6 of 6\n,~ \n1  the Court does not have the underlying evidence supporting the declarations of \n2  either Commander Ball or Ms. Ferguson, the Court declines to make a finding iยง~to \n\"-;;1 \n,!\"~ \n3  the number of class members at this time.  \"'.:.., \nCONCLUSION \n4 \n5  Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Summary Judgment as to \n6  Plaintiffs Third Cause of Action for Violation of Cali fomi a Civil Code Section \n7  52.1 and Section 52.  In addition, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' request for a \n8  finding that the number of class members totals 4989. \n9  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nl' \n10  DATE:  December  ,2004 \nCONSUELO B.
