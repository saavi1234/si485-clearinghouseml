Plaintiff requested leave to amend his complaint.</p><p>The District Court (Senior District Judge Kane) denied the government's request for dismissal and granted plaintiff leave to amend the complaint, listing as plaintiffs his wife and a class consisting of \"all persons who have in the past or may in the future be subjected to Denver Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) illegal procedures aimed at depriving them of their right to seek judicial review or judicial or administrative stay of deportation.\"  Wright v. Greene, 910 F.Supp. 510 (D.Colo. Jan. 09, 1996).</p><p>Thereafter, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss and several supplemental briefs in support of dismissal.  On September 11, 2000, the District Court (Judge Walker D. Miller) granted defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state claim.  Judgment was entered in favor of defendants and the case was closed.</p><p></p>",

GREENE, District Director and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service,\nDefendants.\nCivil Action No. 94-K-2883.\nUnited States District Court, D. Colorado.\nJanuary 9, 1996.\n511 *511 Lane McFee, Denver, CO, for plaintiff.\nMichael Hegarty, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Denver, CO, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nKANE, Senior District Judge.\nOn December 19, 1994, Plaintiff Gregory Wright filed a complaint against the United States Immigration and\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\") and its District Director Joseph Greene. Wright sought a determination that his wife\nMihyang Kim Wright was deported illegally from the United States and sought her return to this jurisdiction for\n[1]\nfurther proceedings.\nBefore me are Plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint and Defendants' renewed motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint.\nI. Factual Background.\nAccording to the complaint, on April 20, 1990, Mihyang Kim Wright a/k/a Mihyang Chase, a citizen of Korea,\nentered the United States on a fiancee visa to marry Carl Chase. She married Chase on December 19, 1990.\nMihyang Kim met Plaintiff Gregory Wright in 1991 and began living with him in June 1991.\nOn December 31, 1991, an order to show cause was issued charging Mihyang Kim Wright with deportability for\nfailure to comply with her nonimmigrant status.\nOn April 8, 1992, Mihyang Kim Wright divorced Chase. On April 29, 1992, she married Plaintiff Gregory Wright.\nOn June 8, 1992, an immigration judge found Mihyang Kim Wright deportable and denied her application for\nvoluntary departure. She filed an appeal of that decision on June 22, 1992. On June 1, 1993, the Board of\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") dismissed the appeal as having been filed one day late and did not address the\nmerits. On June 9, 1993, the INS sent Mihyang Kim Wright a notice advising of the warrant of deportation issued\non that date and that she could be deported at any time without further notice.\nIn the early hours of June 18, 1993, former counsel for Mihyang Kim Wright, Dan Boyle, was awakened at home\nand advised by deportation officers that Mihyang Kim Wright was being deported. The officers advised counsel\nthat a petition for review would not stay the deportation in view of the immigration judge's findings of marriage\n[2]\nfraud violations under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"Act\") § 204(c), 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c).\nCounsel indicated he would review this assertion when he arrived at work in approximately one hour and would\n512 re-contact the deportation officers. The complaint alleges the officers indicated the flight plan involved *512 going\n\nthrough California and if a petition was filed they would be notified by their superior before the flight took off for\nKorea.\nAt approximately 8:30 a.m., counsel contacted United States Attorney George Gill, then representing the INS and\nlocal INS trial attorney, Doug Bow and concluded filing a petition for review would stay the deportation of Mihyang\nKim Wright. At approximately 10:00 a.m. Counsel filed a petition for review with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals\n[3]\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(3).\nAt approximately 1:00 p.m., counsel learned Norm Shoss, the head of deportation at the INS had decided not to\nstop the deportation because the officers and petitioner may have been outside the jurisdiction of the Tenth\nCircuit at the time the petition was filed and were outside the jurisdiction at the time they received notice of the\nfiling.\nOn September 3, 1993, counsel filed a motion to dismiss the appeal before the Tenth Circuit, asserting that since\nMihyang Kim Wright was deported, albeit in counsel's opinion, illegally, the court no longer had jurisdiction. The\nTenth Circuit dismissed the appeal on September 7, 1993.\nOn July 1, 1993, Plaintiff Gregory Wright filed a Petition for Alien Relative Status under 8 U.S.C. § 1154. The INS\ndenied the petition on November 22, 1994.\nII. Procedural Background.\nOn December 14, 1994, Wright filed the subject complaint alleging he and his wife had been separated for nearly\none and a half years due to her illegal deportation. He requested a determination that the deportation was illegal\nand that Mihyang Kim Wright be returned to this jurisdiction for further proceedings.\nOn March 27, 1995, Defendants filed an answer and motion to dismiss the complaint. They contended 8 U.S.C. §\n1105a(c) was applicable and barred this court's jurisdiction in this matter. That section reads pertinently:\nAn order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not\nexhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and\nregulations or if he has departed from the United States after the issuance of the order.\n8 U.S.C. § 1105a(c).\nOn March 28, 1995, Chief Judge Matsch ordered a response to the motion to dismiss. On May 1, 1995, Judge\nMatsch transferred this case to me.\nOn May 18, 1995, Wright filed a Motion to Amend Complaint in Habeas Proceedings. Wright seeks to amend the\ncomplaint to add as Plaintiffs Mihyang Kim Wright and \"All Persons who have in the past or may in the future be\nsubjected to Denver Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) illegal procedures aimed at depriving them of\ntheir right to seek judicial review or judicial or administrative stay of deportation.\" (Mot.Am.Compl.Habeas\nProceedings at 1.) He requests me to certify this as a class action as a \"pattern and practice\" violation by the\nINS. (Id.)\nHe claims I have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1329 (giving the district courts of the United States\njurisdiction of all causes arising under any of the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\")); 28\nU.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction); 5 U.S.C. § 702 (giving the right of judicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act to a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action); and habeas corpus\njurisdiction under (now) 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(10) (giving any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of\ndeportation the right to obtain judicial review thereof).\nIn their response to the motion to amend the complaint, Defendants renew their motion to dismiss and assert\nPlaintiff's failure to respond to the motion is improper. Defendants nevertheless respond to the motion to amend\nthe complaint insofar as it seeks class treatment for Plaintiff's claims.\n513 *513 I deny the motion to dismiss, grant the motion to amend and defer the issue of class certification.\n\nIII. Jurisdiction.\nIn Salehi v. District Director, I.N.S., the Tenth Circuit explained the jurisdiction of the courts in immigration cases:\nThe district courts have jurisdiction generally of all civil and criminal causes arising under the\nimmigration statutes. See 8 U.S.C. § 1329. This grant of jurisdiction is limited, however, by section\n106(a) of the Act, which provides that jurisdiction is exclusively in the courts of appeals over\npetitions for judicial review of final orders of deportation entered against aliens in the United States\npursuant to administrative proceedings under section 242(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b).\nSection 242(b) proceedings are conducted by an immigration judge to determine whether an alien\nmay be deported, and the immigration judge's decision is reviewable by the BIA. An exception to\nthe exclusive court of appeals jurisdiction is provided by section 106(a)(9) which states \"any alien\nheld in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas\ncorpus proceedings.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(9).\n796 F.2d 1286, 1289 (10th Cir.1986) (footnote omitted).\nTitle 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(c) limits the jurisdiction of courts to review deportation orders, such that \"[a]n order of\ndeportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien ... has departed from the United States\nafter the issuance of the order.\" The Tenth Circuit has held the statute's directive is unequivocal: \"[O]nce\npetitioner departed the United States via deportation, a deportation order may not be reviewed by `any court.'\" \nSaadi v. INS, 912 F.2d 428, 428 (10th Cir.1990) (quoting Umanzor v. Lambert, 782 F.2d 1299, 1303 (5th Cir.1986)\n).\nDefendants request dismissal relying on 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(c), Saadi and its progeny.\nIn his motion to amend and reply, Wright argues he, Mihyang Kim Wright and the proposed class plaintiffs are not\nseeking review of Mihyang Kim Wright's final order of deportation, but rather challenge a pattern and practice of\nthe District Office of the INS in Denver of hastening the deportation of aliens without the seventy-two hour fore-\nwarning used in other districts for illegal purposes. As part of this practice, Wright asserts, Mihyang Kim Wright's\ndeportation was hastened and carried out illegally in contravention of the mandatory stay of deportation in place\nbefore she left the United States and while she was in the custody of the INS.\nA number of circuits, including the Tenth Circuit, have \"drawn a distinction between jurisdiction to rule on the\nmerits of an individual deportation order and jurisdiction to rule on an alleged pattern and practice of\nconstitutional or statutory violations.\" El Rescate Legal Serv., Inc. v. Executive Office of Immigration Review, 959\nF.2d 742, 747 (9th Cir.1991) (citing Montes v. Thornburgh, 919 F.2d 531, 535 (9th Cir.1990); National Center for\nImmigrants' Rights, Inc. v. INS, 913 F.2d 1350, 1352 (9th Cir.1990),rev'd on other grounds,502 U.S. 183, 112\nS.Ct. 551, 116 L.Ed.2d 546 (1991); National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc. v. INS, 743 F.2d 1365, 1368-69\n(9th Cir.1984); Salehi v. District Director, INS, 796 F.2d 1286, 1290 (10th Cir.1986); Haitian Refugee Center v.\nSmith, 676 F.2d 1023, 1032-33 (5th Cir.1982); Jean v. Nelson, 727 F.2d 957, 979-80 (11th Cir. 1984) (en banc), \naff'd,472 U.S. 846, 105 S.Ct. 2992, 86 L.Ed.2d 664 (1985)).\nIn Salehi, the Tenth Circuit recognized \"[a]lthough petitioners' due process claims attack the constitutionality of\nregulations governing motions to reopen, their claims constitute a general attack upon the regulations and do not\ninvolve appeals from denials of motions to reopen or determinations made incident to a motion to reopen.\" 796\nF.2d at 1290. The court cited Haitian Refugee Center v. Smith, 676 F.2d at 1032-33 where the district court was\nfound to have jurisdiction over constitutional challenge to a \"program, pattern or scheme\" by INS officials in\nconducting deportation and asylum proceedings for Haitian aliens. 796 F.2d at 1290.\n514 *514 Insofar as the complaint \"set[s] forth matters alleged to be part of a pattern and practice by immigration\nofficials to violate the constitutional rights of a class of aliens they constitute wrongs which are independently\ncognizable in the district court under its federal question jurisdiction.\" Haitian Refugee Center, 676 F.2d at 1033\nand n. 22.\n\nAlthough a court of appeals may have sole jurisdiction to review alleged procedural irregularities in\nan individual deportation hearing to the extent these irregularities may provide a basis for\nreversing an individual deportation order, that is not to say that a program, pattern or scheme by\nimmigration officials to violate the constitutional rights of aliens is not a separate matter subject to\nexamination by a district court and to the entry of at least declaratory and injunctive relief. The\ndistinction we draw is one between the authority of a court of appeals to pass upon the merits of\nan individual deportation order and any action in the deportation proceeding to the extent it may\naffect the merits determination, on the one hand, and, on the other, the authority of a district court\nto wield its equitable powers when a wholesale, carefully orchestrated, program of constitutional\nviolations is alleged.\nHaitian Refugee Center, 676 F.2d at 1033 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).\nLikening petitioners' claims to those in Haitian Refugee Center, the Salehi court found they bore no relation to\npetitioners' individual final orders of deportation and exclusive jurisdiction did not lie with the appeals court under\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). Salehi, 796 F.2d at 1290.\nHere, Wright, Mihyang Kim Wright and the proposed class of plaintiffs challenge an alleged pattern and practice\nby the INS to violate their constitutional rights. Therefore, I have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal\nquestion) and § 279 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1329 (claims arising under the immigration statutes) and my\njurisdiction is not, as Defendants claim, excluded under 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(c).\nIV. Class Action.\nWright moves to amend the complaint to add as plaintiffs, \"Mihyang Kim Wright, and All Persons who have in the\npast or may in the future be subjected to Denver Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) illegal procedures\naimed at depriving them of their right to seek judicial review or judicial or administrative stay of deportation.\"\n(Mot. Am.Compl. Habeas Proceedings ¶ 1.) He also requests me to \"certify this as a class action as a `pattern\nand practice' violation by the INS allowing plaintiffs redress without requiring piecemeal individual litigation, thus\nconserving judicial resources.\" (Id. ¶ 2.)\nDefendants request me to deny the motion to amend the complaint because Gregory Wright has not complied\nwith Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a). That rule provides:\nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all\nonly if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are\nquestions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative\nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(a).\nDefendants maintain Wright has not asserted nor is there evidence of record that the numerosity, commonality or\ntypicality requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied. They further assert Wright has not satisfied the requirement of\nRule 23(b) that there is a risk of inconsistent adjudications or that adjudications with respect to individual\nmembers of the proposed class would be dispositive of the interests of other members not parties to the\nadjudications or substantially impair their abilities to protect their interests.\n\"[F]or an action to go forward under Rule 23, the pleader must set forth sufficient allegations to show that the four\nrequirements set forth in subdivision (a) are satisfied and that the action falls within one of the three categories\n515 described in subdivision (b).\" 7B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary *515 Kay Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure, § 1798 (2 ed. 1986) (footnote omitted).\nRule 23(c)(1) provides that, as soon as practicable after the commencement of a class action, \"the court shall\ndetermine by order whether it is to be so maintained.\" A party wishing to challenge the validity of maintaining an\n\naction under Rule 23 should move for a determination under Rule 23(c)(1), rather than by moving to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim. 7B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, supra, § 1798.\nDefendants' challenge to the maintenance of the suit as a class action is premature. Wright moves to amend the\ncomplaint to add a class of plaintiffs and maintain this as a class action. He has not attached a proposed\namended complaint.\nI do not address whether the yet to be drafted amended complaint satisfies the pleading requirements of Rule 23.\nUpon the granting of this motion, Wright will be required to file an amended complaint consistent with the\nrequirements of Rule 23. Notably, however, he will not be required to establish the merits of his case before a\npreliminary determination of the class action question can be made. Id.\nV. Conclusion.\nFor the aforesaid reasons, I deny Defendants' motion to dismiss and grant Wright's motion to amend the\ncomplaint to allow him to add Mihyang Kim Wright and the proposed class of additional plaintiffs. I defer any\nruling as to whether the action may be maintained as a class action until such time as is practicable after the filing\nof the amended complaint.\nThe amended complaint must comply with the pleading requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and\n23. In particular, the amended pleading should contain a short, plain, statement of the grounds upon which the\ncourt's jurisdiction depends and of each claim showing entitlement to the specific relief sought. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8.
