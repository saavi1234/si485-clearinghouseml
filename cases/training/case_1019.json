    "summary": "<p>On September 26, 1990, the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund (LDF) filed a class action civil rights lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1985. The class included more than 100 minority residents of Lynwood, a South-Central Los Angeles neighborhood. The plaintiffs sued the County of Los Angeles (&ldquo;County&rdquo;), the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (&ldquo;LASD&rdquo;), the City of Lynwood (&ldquo;City&rdquo;), and several individual LASD employees. The suit sought damages and injunctive relief, alleging that deputies of the LASD&rsquo;s Lynwood station systematically engaged in racial discrimination, beatings, unjustified shootings, unreasonable searches and seizures, false arrests, retaliation against citizens who complained, failure to properly investigate complaints, and other unlawful conduct. It further alleged that some Lynwood deputies belonged to a neo-Nazi, white supremacist gang known as the \"Vikings.\" The case was assigned to District Judge Terry J. Hatter, Jr.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 23, 1991, Judge Hatter granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against the LASD. The court also ordered the LASD to follow its own policies regarding the use of force and searches, and to submit copies of all reports alleging the use of excessive force by LASD deputies to the court for in camera review on the first of every month. The LASD appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. District Judge William H. Orrick and Circuit Judges Mary M. Schroeder and Alex Kozinski heard the appeal. District Judge Hatter stayed the injunction pending the appeal.</p>\r\n<p>Represented by the NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 1, 1992. The amended complaint alleged that the LASD, the City, and the County violated and conspired to violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments by permitting and authorizing the Lynwood deputies&rsquo; unlawful conduct. It also asked the court to appoint a special master to ensure compliance with the Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>On February 12, 1993, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court&rsquo;s preliminary injunction. Judge Schroeder held that the preliminary injunction was overbroad in scope and not supported by the record, which constrained unresolved factual disputes. For instance, the record contained no specific findings to support the district court&rsquo;s conclusion that there is a &ldquo;direct link between departmental policy makers, who tacitly authorize deputies&rsquo; unconstitutional behavior, and the injuries suffered by the defendant.&rdquo; Additionally, the preliminary injunction was overbroad because it applied to the entire LASD, but the plaintiffs only alleged misconduct by Lynwood deputies. Judge Orrick dissented. The Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs&rsquo; claims proceeded to trial. After over three weeks of testimony, which included evidence regarding the Kolts Report, the jury returned a multi-million dollar verdict for the plaintiffs on July 14, 1995. The parties settled the case post-verdict for $6 million payable to the plaintiffs, and allocated $1.5 million for use of force training by the LASD in accordance with the recommendations made by the Kolts Report. The court approved the class action settlement on January 26, 1996, and directed that certain settlement documents be filed under seal. The court then terminated the case with prejudice on February 2, 1996.</p>\r\n<p>On June 14, 2006, an incarcerated individual who was convicted of killing a LASD deputy filed a motion to intervene in the case. He sought to access parts of the district court record to obtain evidence for his state court habeas corpus petition. The district court denied that motion on July 31, 2006, and the prisoner appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit on August 25, 2006. Circuit Judges Alfred Theodore Goodwin, Andrew J. Kleinfeld, and Jay S. Bybee vacated and remanded the district court&rsquo;s decision on May 16, 2008, on the grounds that the district court did not state a reason for its denial of the motion. The prisoner renewed his motion, but the district court again denied it on February 11, 2009, finding that the request was not relevant to his collateral litigation. The prisoner appealed again on February 26, 2009. Ninth Circuit Judges Ferdinand Fernandez, Barry G. Silverman, and Susan P. Graber again vacated and remanded the district court&rsquo;s decision on April 30, 2010. The Ninth Circuit found that the prisoner&rsquo;s motion to intervene was moot, since the protective order&rsquo;s scope was smaller than the prisoner believed, and no modification was necessary.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

ITiese  practices include but are not limited to using  so-called\n7 \"creative report writing,\" i.e., filing materially false police reports, and making\n8 false statements to prosecution authorities to obtain the filing of false charges\n9 and the institution of false and malicious prosecutions against victims of the\n10 deputies' misconduct.\n11 x.  Deputies remove or cover-up their name tags and conceal their identity in\n12 incidents involving the improper use of firearms or the use of excessive force,\n13 violence or racial and ethnic bias by deputies.\n14 y.  Deputies adhere to an unwritten \"code of silence\" which  consists of one\n15 simple rule: a deputy docs not provide adverse information  against a fellow\n16 deputy.  Deputy misconduct is allowed to continue even though witnessed by\n17 other deputies.  The code of silence, which influences  the behavior of many\n18 deputies in a variety of ways, violates a deputy's public responsibility to ensure\n19 compliance with the law.^\n20 z.  Defendants fail to punish deputies who abide by the code of silence, and fail\n21 to protect deputies who break the code of silence from harassment or retaliation\n22 by other deputies.  Deputies therefore  believe that if they  fail  or refuse  to\n23 participate in the \"code of silence\" or fail to cover up or conceal the misconduct\n24 of other deputies, that such failures will cause them to be ostracized by other\n25 deputies, will adversely aftect their ability to get support from other deputies in\n26 the field, and will adversely affect their opportunities for promotion and other\n27 employment benefits,\n28 aa.

Hatter, District Judge, Presiding \nSubmitted April 7, 2008** \nPasadena, CA \nBefore: GOODWIN, KLEINFELD, and BYBEE, Circuit Judges. \nFreddie Fuiava appeals the district court's denial of his motion to intervene \nin this closed case in the Central District, to seek modification of a protective order \nthat apparently is still in effect. \nFuiava, a prisoner seeking post-conviction relief in state court, alleges a \nneed to access parts of the district court record to obtain evidence for use in his \nstate court habeas corpus petition.  The district court denied the motion without \nstating a reason for its denial.  We vacate the challenged order and remand the \nmotion to give the district court an opportunity to state the reasons for its ruling. \nIn Foltz v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 331 F.3d 1122 \n(9th Cir. 2003), we held that district courts abuse their discretion when they deny \nmotions seeking modification of a protective order without explanation. \n...  The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without \noral argument.  See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2). \n6  06-56228 \n\nCase 2:90-cv-05217-TJH   Document 1933   Filed 05/16/08   Page 12 of 15   Page ID #:17\nOn May 26, 2006, the California Superior Court in which Fuiava is pursuing \nhis post-conviction remedy, granted in part his motion to conduct discovery of \ncertain records from the Los Angeles County Sheriff s Department.  Fuiava then \nmade the pending motion to intervene in this case, requesting that the district court \nmodify its protective order.  Los Angeles County opposed the motion.  Fuiava \nstated that he needed discovery of the underlying documentation relating to a \ndeputy's use of force on the twenty individuals about whom the deputy had been \nquestioned in his deposition, as well as \"other documents that support his claim \nthat there was a culture of misconduct prevalent at the Lynwood station ....\"  \nOn July 31, 2006, the district court denied Fuiava's motion to intervene \nwithout explanation.  The entire disposition states:  \"The Court has considered the \nmotion of Freddie Fuiava to intervene to seek modification of the protective order, \ntogether with the moving and opposing papers.  It is Ordered that the motion be, \nand hereby is, Denied.\" \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) permits intervention by a collateral \nlitigant for the purpose of seeking modification of a protective order, even after the \nconclusion of the underlying action.  Beckman Indus., Inc. v. Int'l Ins. Co., 966 \nF.2d 470,472-73 (9th Cir. 1992).  \"This court strongly favors access to discovery \nmaterials to meet the needs of parties engaged in collateral litigation.\"  Foltz, 331 \n7  06-56228 \n\nCase 2:90-cv-05217-TJH   Document 1933   Filed 05/16/08   Page 13 of 15   Page ID #:18\nF .3d at 1131.  When evaluating a collateral litigant' s request for modification of a \nprotective order, the district court must first assess the relevance of the protected \ndiscovery to the collateral proceedings.  Id. at 1132.  \"[R]elevance hinges on the \ndegree of overlap in facts, parties, and issues between the suit covered by the \nprotective order and the collateral proceedings.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Second, the court must \"weigh the countervailing reliance interest of the \nparty opposing modification against the policy of avoiding duplicative discovery.\" \nId. at 1133. \nThe district court must explain its decision to allow for appellate review.  In \nFoltz, the district court issued a cursory denial of the collateral litigant's motion to \nmodify the protective order, without specifying the basis for its decision.  Id. at \n1133-34.  We held that the district court abused its discretion because it \"utterly \nfail[ ed] to apply [the legal rules] to the facts of this case\" and \"articulate[ d] no \nbasis\" for its conclusions.  Id.  1134.  We remanded \"with instructions to make a \nrelevance determination based upon a comparison of the complaints ... , the \ncontents of the protected discovery, the general rules on the scope of discovery in \nthe collateral jurisdictions, and any other relevant factors ....\"   Id. \nIn this case, the district court's order contains no reference to the controlling \nlegal rules, nor does it apply these principles to the protected discovery in light of \n8  06-56228 \n\nCase 2:90-cv-05217-TJH   Document 1933   Filed 05/16/08   Page 14 of 15   Page ID #:19\nFuiava's collateral state proceedings.  See Foltz, 331 F.3d at 1133-34.  As Fuiava \nnotes in his reply brief, the district court's denial \"gave this Court nothing upon \nwhich to base meaningful appellate review.\" \nThe district court's role in ruling on this motion is limited to making \"a \nrough estimate of relevance,\" and \"[ e] ven if [it] modifies the protective order, it \ndoes not decide whether the collateral litigants will ultimately obtain the discovery \nmaterials.\"  Id. at 1132-33.  \"[D]isputes over the ultimate discoverability of \nspecific materials covered by the protective order must be resolved by the \ncollateral courts.\"  Id. at 1133 (emphasis added).  Here, the federal district court \nneed decide only whether to modify its protective order.  The state court has the \nsole authority to address whether the protected case materials are discoverable \nunder California law, and whether habeas corpus is the proper collateral remedy. \nFinally, the County contends that Fuiava's motion to intervene violates the \nRooker-Feldman doctrine, which prohibits federal district courts from hearing \nappeals from state court judgments.  See D. C. Court ofA  ppeals v. Feldman, 460 \nU.S. 462 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923).  Fuiava is not \nappealing a state court judgment.  Rather, his motion to intervene asks the federal \ndistrict court to modify a protective order that it entered in a previous case.  The \nstate courts will retain full control over the discovery process in Fuiava's state \n9  06-56228 \n\nCase 2:90-cv-05217-TJH   Document 1933   Filed 05/16/08   Page 15 of 15   Page ID #:20\ncourt habeas proceedings.  See Foltz, 331 F.3d at 1133 (\"If the protective order is \nmodified, the collateral courts may freely control the discovery processes in the \ncontroversies before them without running up against the protective order of \nanother court.\"). \nThe challenged order is vacated and the cause is remanded to the district \ncourt for further proceedings. \n10  06-56228 ",

Olson, Greines, Martin, Stein & Richland, Beverly Hills, Cal., for defendants-appellants.\nPatrick O. Patterson, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., Los Angeles, Cal., for plaintiffs-\nappellees.\n[*]\nBefore: SCHROEDER and KOZINSKI, Circuit Judges, and ORRICK,  District Judge.\nSCHROEDER, Circuit Judge:\nThe plaintiffs, predominately black and hispanic residents of the City of Lynwood, California, brought this section\n1983 class action alleging that deputy sheriffs at the Lynwood station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's\n506 Department were mistreating minority citizens. The complaint, filed against the County of Los Angeles, the *506\nCity of Lynwood, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, supervisory personnel within the Sheriff's\nDepartment, and individual Sheriff's deputies, includes allegations of unlawful detentions and searches, beatings,\nshootings, terrorist activities, and destruction of property. Specifically, the plaintiffs charge that deputy sheriffs in\nLynwood use excessive force in detaining minority citizens and employ unlawful procedures in searching\nresidences occupied by minorities. This appeal, filed by the defendants, challenges the preliminary injunction\nissued by the district court in an effort to bring to an end the incidents of police misconduct.\nThe injunction issued by the district court ordered the entire Los Angeles Sheriff's Department to do the following:\n1. Follow the Department's own stated policies and guidelines regarding the use of force and\nprocedures for conducting searches; and\n2. Submit to the Court in camera and under seal, copies of reports alleging the use of excessive\nforce that are in the possession of the Department on the first of every month.\nPursuant to the defendants' request for emergency appellate relief, this court stayed the injunction pending\nappeal.\n\nWe reverse the district court's injunction because its broad geographic and substantive scope is not supported by\nthe record before us, and because the district court entered the injunction and subsequent findings of fact without\nresolving some serious factual disputes concerning the specific incidents of misconduct alleged. We hold that the\nplaintiffs do have standing to pursue this action and we remand for further proceedings.\nProceedings Below\nThe misconduct as described by the plaintiffs is both malicious and pervasive. Affidavits collected during the early\nstages of litigation charge that black and hispanic men have been repeatedly arrested without cause and\nseverely beaten at the Lynwood station, the County jail, and the \"Operations Safe Streets\" trailer. Guns,\nflashlights, fists, clubs, boots, a brick wall, and an electric Taser gun were just a few of the weapons allegedly\nused to injure individual plaintiffs. Many of the victims required medical treatment after being \"apprehended\" by\nLynwood deputies, and some were hospitalized. Firearms were purportedly used to terrorize suspects. Affidavits\nrecount instances where deputies placed the muzzle of a firearm in a suspect's ear, mouth or behind his head,\nand threatened to pull the trigger, or actually fired the gun without discharging a bullet. The plaintiffs also cite ten\nincidents where deputies allegedly illegally forced entry into residences, searched and ransacked the premises,\nand then left without arresting anyone. Many of the incidents described by the plaintiffs involved racial slurs and\nobscene language directed at the victim of the beating or search.\nThe plaintiffs filed volumes of declarations and affidavits in support of their allegations and defendants responded\nin kind. There was no evidentiary hearing. The record is described in appellees' brief as follows:\nIn support of their preliminary injunction motion, plaintiffs filed over 200 pages of documentary\nevidence, including 58 declarations detailing the deputies' misconduct and 33 color photographs\nof injuries and property damage suffered by the victims. Plaintiffs also relied on documents they\nhad previously filed in opposition to defendants' pending motions, including certified copies of the\ndeclarations of 11 deputies and news reports concerning the existence and activities of the\n\"Vikings,\" a white-supremacist gang of deputies operating within the Lynwood substation.\nDefendants responded with more than 1,200 pages of declarations and other documents in an\neffort to refute plaintiffs' claims. In reply, plaintiffs filed 25 additional declarations and other\ndocuments.\nThe plaintiffs sought from the district court a preliminary injunction to prevent further violent acts and unlawful\nsearches. Before argument, the plaintiffs presented the court with a proposed order which anticipated enjoining\n507 only department personnel acting within \"the jurisdiction of the *507 Lynwood station.\" The defendants\nrepresented to the court, however, that the Department's deputy assignment policy would make such an order\nimpossible and, if issued, would \"interject confusion into law enforcement operations.\" In response, the district\ncourt granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, but struck the geographic limitation contained in\nthe proposed order. The preliminary injunction was entered on September 23, 1991.\nAlthough two weeks later the district court filed written findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of the\npreliminary injunction order, they were entered without an evidentiary hearing and did not resolve any specific\n[1]\nconflicting factual allegations.  The findings of fact and conclusions of law are reprinted in their entirety in the\nAppendix.\nStanding\nAs a threshold matter, appellants challenge plaintiffs' standing to pursue this action in which they seek to\nrepresent a class of residents and visitors to the Lynwood area who have been or may be mistreated by Lynwood\nSheriff's deputies on account of their race, color, national origin, age, or economic class. Appellants rely\nprincipally on City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).\n\nThe Article III \"case or controversy\" requirement restricts federal jurisdiction to those cases where the plaintiffs\ncan maintain that their injury or the threat of future injury by the defendants is \"both `real and immediate,' not\n`conjectural or hypothetical.'\" Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102, 103 S.Ct. at 1665 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs allege that\nthey are suffering ongoing irreparable injury as a result of the Lynwood deputies' terrorist-type tactics. Further,\nthey contend that there is a direct link between the department policy makers and the injuries suffered by the\nplaintiffs.\nThe majority of the incidents alleged by the plaintiffs are said to have occurred within a six by seven block area\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Lynwood station. Seventy-five plaintiffs allege that they were victims of police\nmisconduct, many within this small section of the City. A number of the class members are alleged to have been\nrepeatedly subject to police brutality and harassment. This is significant as the \"possibility of recurring injury\nceases to be speculative when actual repeated incidents are documented.\" Nicacio v. United States I.N.S., 797\nF.2d 700, 702 (9th Cir.1985).\nAlso significant is the fact that members of the plaintiff class have been subjected to retaliatory attacks in\nresponse to the filing of this action. In O'Shea v. Littleton, the Supreme Court dismissed a complaint alleging\ndiscrimination in sentencing, holding that \"[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present\ncase or controversy regarding injunctive relief ... if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse affects.\"\n414 U.S. 488, 495-96, 94 S.Ct. 669, 676, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). Repeated instances of violence and retaliatory\nconfrontations are \"continuing present adverse affects\" and cause the threatened injury to be \"sufficiently real\nand immediate to show an existing controversy.\" Id. at 496, 94 S.Ct. at 676.\nLyons does counsel caution with respect to federal intervention in state law enforcement matters. See LaDuke v.\nNelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1323 (9th Cir.1985) (citing Lyons, 461 U.S. at 112, 103 S.Ct. at 1670). Lyons too involved\na federal court's order enjoining allegedly unconstitutional conduct of city law enforcement officials. The Court\nexplained that to prevail on the standing question, Lyons needed to \"credibly allege that he faced a realistic threat\nfrom the future application of the City's policy.\" Id. at 107 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. at 1667 n. 7. The Court held that Lyons,\n508 one citizen *508 in a very large city, could not credibly allege that he would again be detained by the police and\nagain be the victim of a police chokehold. In contrast, the record before this court indicates that numerous\ninstances of police misconduct have occurred in a small six by seven block area, some minority residents of the\narea have been mistreated by deputies more than once, and many victims purportedly did nothing to warrant\ndetention or apprehension prior to the mistreatment. Moreover, plaintiffs have alleged that the misconduct is\npurposefully aimed at minorities and that such misconduct was condoned and tacitly authorized by department\npolicy makers. We conclude that the plaintiffs have alleged a \"real and immediate threat of injury\" and\nconsequently have presented a justiciable controversy. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 103, 103 S.Ct. at 1666.\nMerits of the Injunction\nThe primary question raised by this appeal is whether the equitable relief granted by the district court was\npermissible given the evidence offered by the parties. For two reasons we conclude that the injunction, as issued,\nmust be vacated. First, the district court's finding that the abuses in question were the product of departmental\npolicy is not supported by this record containing conflicting declarations unresolved by an evidentiary hearing or\nspecific factual findings. Second, the injunction was too sweeping. Our holding, however, is limited to the record\nbefore us and does not preclude the grant of narrower preliminary or permanent injunctive relief on the basis of a\nmore fully developed record.\nI. Showing departmental policy: the need to resolve factual disputes.\n\"Our review of a motion for preliminary injunction is `very limited.'\" International Molders' & Allied Workers' Local\nUnion No. 164 v. Nelson, 799 F.2d 547, 550 (9th Cir.1986). However, we may overturn a preliminary injunction if\nthe record does not support the district court's conclusion that the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits. Id. at\n551; see also Caribbean Marine Services Co. v. Baldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674-75 (9th Cir.1988). When the district\ncourt imposes a preliminary injunction on a state agency, a strong factual record is necessary; our review of the\n\ninjunction must be more rigorous when we review an injunction against a state as opposed to a federal agency,\nsince the Supreme Court requires a showing of an intentional and pervasive pattern of misconduct in order to\nenjoin a state agency. Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 375, 96 S.Ct. 598, 606, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976).\nA state law enforcement agency may be enjoined from committing constitutional violations where there is proof\nthat officers within the agency have engaged in a persistent pattern of misconduct. Allee v. Medrano, 416 U.S.\n802, 815-16, 94 S.Ct. 2191, 2200-01, 40 L.Ed.2d 566 (1974); Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization,\n307 U.S. 496, 517, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939). In Allee, the Supreme Court upheld a permanent\ninjunction restraining further unconstitutional conduct by various Texas state law enforcement officials who had\nunlawfully threatened, detained, confined, and physically assaulted union leaders engaged in organizing efforts. \nId.416 U.S. at 804-05, 815, 94 S.Ct. at 2195, 2200. In affirming the district court's injunction, the Supreme Court\nfound that the constitutional violations \"were not a series of isolated incidents but a prevailing pattern\" of police\nmisconduct. Id. at 809, 94 S.Ct. at 2197.\nTwo years after Allee, the Supreme Court again had reason to examine a federal court's equitable power to\nenjoin a state law enforcement agency. In Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976),\nthe Supreme Court reaffirmed the factual showing required under Allee 00 a pervasive pattern of police\n97\nmisconduct 00 but further defined that standard to include only that conduct \"which flowed from an intentional,\n97\nconcerted, and indeed conspiratorial effort to deprive [the victims] of their [constitutional] rights.\" Id.423 U.S. at\n375, 96 S.Ct. at 606.\nIn Rizzo, as in this case, equitable relief was granted by the district court in an effort to halt instances of police\nbrutality directed at minority citizens. The injunction issued by the district court ordered police officials to submit\n509 for approval a comprehensive program for dealing with *509 civilian complaints alleging police misconduct. Id. at\n365, 96 S.Ct. at 601-02. The Supreme Court held that nineteen constitutional violations in a year's time, by only a\nsmall percentage of the police, did not warrant injunctive relief. Id. at 367-369, 375, 96 S.Ct. at 602-03, 606. In\narticulating how the plaintiffs had failed in their proof, the Court explained that to succeed the plaintiffs needed to\nshow that the police misconduct flowed from a policy, plan, or a pervasive pattern. Further, this pattern, plan or\npolicy had to be causally linked to the defendants named in the action. The Court placed considerable emphasis\non the fact that the officers who actually participated in the alleged incidents of misconduct were not named as\ndefendants in the action. Id. at 375, 96 S.Ct. at 606.\nUnlike Rizzo, the plaintiffs in this case did name as defendants twenty-one individual sheriff's deputies who were\npurportedly responsible for the misconduct. Supervisory personnel were also named defendants. The plaintiffs\nargue that the challenged conduct is causally linked to the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department policies, citing the\nlarge number of incidents, the racial animus motivating the violence, the Department's vigorous campaign against\nminority-race gangs, and the purported existence of a gang of white Sheriff deputies known as the \"Vikings.\"\nSpecific findings of a persistent pattern of misconduct supported by a fully defined record can support broad\ninjunctive relief. See, e.g., Orantes-Hernandez v. Thornburgh, 919 F.2d 549 (9th Cir.1990). But there are no\nsimilar specific findings here to support the district court's general conclusion that there is \"a direct link between\ndepartmental policy makers, who tacitly authorize deputies' unconstitutional behavior, and the injuries suffered by\nthe defendant.\"\nThe parties to this action submitted diametrically opposing declarations and counter-declarations disputing the\nfrequency and seriousness of police misconduct. Before issuing its preliminary injunction, the district court did not\nconduct evidentiary proceedings to resolve any of the disputed matters. We are mindful that plaintiffs' eventual\nburden in obtaining a permanent injunction against a state law enforcement agency is to establish more than\nrepeated incidents of misconduct. See Rizzo, 423 U.S. at 374-375, 96 S.Ct. at 605-606. The record in this case\ndoes not yet contain a sufficient basis on which to evaluate the likelihood of the plaintiffs' succeeding on the\nmerits in establishing, not merely misconduct, but a pervasive pattern of misconduct reflecting departmental\npolicy.\n\nII. The breadth of the injunction.\nThe district court's order directed all Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department employees to follow \"the\nDepartment's own stated policies and guidelines regarding the use of force and procedures for conducting\nsearches.\" The plaintiffs presented no evidence supporting application of the injunction in areas other than the\njurisdiction of the Lynwood station. The work assignment policy of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,\nupon which defendants based their objection to any injunction being entered, does not justify application of this\ninjunction to all Sheriff's Department employees working in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The injunction\nplaintiffs initially proposed would have bound only Department personnel acting \"within the jurisdiction of the\nLynwood station.\" Neither the record nor the plaintiffs' allegations support an injunction against the entire Sheriff's\nDepartment without geographic circumscription.\nThe district court's injunction also directs compliance, under penalty of contempt, with all department policies and\nguidelines for conducting searches and for the use of force. It does not define what the policies are, or how they\ncan be identified. The order thus fails to specify the act or acts sought to be restrained as required by\nFed.R.Civ.P. 65(d).\nPlaintiffs incorrectly rely on Davis v. City and County of San Francisco, 890 F.2d 1438 (9th Cir.1989) as authority\nfor their position that the injunction can incorporate departmental policies without specific reference. That case\ndoes not permit the wholesale incorporation of Department policies and guidelines as an injunctive mandate. The\n510 injunction issued in that case incorporated by reference portions of a single *510 general internal order issued by\nthe San Francisco Fire Department requiring that station houses be inspected for racially inflammatory or\nsexually inflammatory material. The injunction, by way of an incorporated order, specified the act or acts sought\nto be restrained. It did not incorporate by reference, all SFFD policies and guidelines.\nFinally, Paragraph two of the district court's injunction directs the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to\n\"[s]ubmit to the Court, in camera and under seal, copies of reports alleging the use of excessive force that are in\nthe possession of the Department on the first of every month.\" The district court is authorized to direct the\nsubmission of such reports to ensure compliance with an injunction. Provided it is not \"overly burden-some,\" such\noversight can be a proper exercise of the district court's discretion \"because it helps ensure compliance with the\ninjunction.\" Gluth v. Kangas, 951 F.2d 1504, 1511 (9th Cir.1991) (upholding injunction requiring state prison\nauthorities to submit to the district court duplicate reports of denials of prisoner supply requests). Requiring\nsubmission of incident reports in camera and under seal is not in and of itself an unduly burdensome way for the\ndistrict court to monitor the defendants' compliance with an otherwise valid order enjoining future unlawful\nconduct. See Kerr v. United States Dist. Ct. for N.D. Cal., 426 U.S. 394, 405-06, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 2125-26, 48\nL.Ed.2d 725 (1976); Guerra v. Board of Trustees of Cal. State Universities, 567 F.2d 352, 355 (9th Cir. 1977) (in\ncamera review, deletion of names, and strict control over copies are a few of the \"read[ily] availab[le] alternatives\nto protect confidentiality\"). In this case, however, this portion of the injunction does not yet further compliance with\nan otherwise valid order and, insofar as it applies to all incidents reported to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's\nDepartment, is even broader than the scope of plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs have alleged deputy misconduct\nonly within the jurisdiction of the Lynwood station. Any reporting provision entered by the district court should be\ntailored to fit within the scope of the litigation and must further an appropriate injunctive remedy.\nConclusion\nThe preliminary injunction entered by the district court is REVERSED AND THE MATTER REMANDED FOR\nFURTHER PROCEEDINGS.\nAPPENDIX\nThe court's findings of fact and conclusions of law provide as follows:\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. Plaintiffs filed this civil rights action suit under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1985 to stop, what they\nperceived to be, the systematic and unjustified shootings, killings, beatings, terrorism, and\ndestruction of property caused by Los Angeles County deputy sheriffs at the Lynwood sub-station.\n2. A motion to certify the class has not yet been filed.\n3. Since the date this case was filed, there have been many confrontations between deputy\nsheriffs and plaintiffs, in an apparent attempt by the deputies to convince plaintiffs to dismiss this\naction.\n4. Several plaintiffs were charged with crimes after they were allegedly brutalized by deputies.\nThese individuals were charged pursuant to an unwritten Sheriffs Department policy of charging a\nperson injured in the course of a routine stop. Because of the unreasonable force used in\neffectuating their arrests, many of these victims had their criminal charges dropped at\narraignment.\n5. Witnesses who attempted to file misconduct reports regarding some of the brutality incidents\nwere discouraged from doing so by deputies and their superiors.\n6. Most of the deputies who work in the Lynwood area are permanently assigned to the Lynwood\nsub-station; however, a significant number of officers, such as reserve officers and members of\n511 department-wide bureaus, are not permanently assigned to the Lynwood sub-station, *511 but\noccasionally work in the Lynwood area.\n7. The actions of many deputies working in the Lynwood sub-station are motivated by racial\nhostility; these deputies regularly disregard the civil rights of individuals they have sworn to\nprotect. Many of the incidents which brought about this motion involved a group of Lynwood area\ndeputies who are members of a neo-nazi, white supremacist gang 00 the Vikings 00 which exists\n97 97\nwith the knowledge of departmental policy makers.\n8. Deputies, who previously worked in the Lynwood sub-station, acknowledge that during the\nperiod they were assigned to Lynwood, it was clear that many of the deputies and sergeants in\nLynwood were out to intimidate and ridicule Blacks and Hispanics.\n9. There is a direct link between departmental policy makers, who tacitly authorize deputies'\nunconstitutional behavior, and the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs.\n10. As a result of the terrorist-type tactics of deputies working in Lynwood, and the policy makers'\ntolerance of such tactics, plaintiffs are being irreparably injured 00 both physically and mentally 00\n97 97\nand their civil rights are being violated.\n11. The evidence presented by the plaintiffs is more credible than that presented by the\ndefendants.\n12. To the extent that any of these findings of fact are deemed to be conclusions of law, they are\nincorporated as conclusions of law.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n1. Plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive relief because:\nA. They requested damages as well as injunctive relief (see Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th\nCir.1984),cert. denied,471 U.S. 1053 (1985));\n\nB. They have alleged a persistent pattern of police misconduct in the Lynwood area from which a\nfuture threat can be inferred (see Smith v. City of Fontana, 818 F.2d 1411 (9th Cir.1987)); and\nC. Their claims for injunctive relief and damages are based on the same operative facts (see \nSmith, 818 F.2d at 1423).\n2. A preliminary injunction should be issued upon a showing of probable success on the merits\nand the possibility of irreparable harm, or the existence of serious questions on the merits and that\nthe balance of hardships tips in the moving party's favor. Vision Sports, Inc. v. Melville Corp., 888\nF.2d 609, 612 (9th Cir.1989).\n3. When the public interest is involved, that factor must be treated as \"one of the traditional\nequitable criteria which a court should consider in granting injunctive relief.\" Chalk v. United\nStates, 840 F.2d 701, 711 (9th Cir.1988).\n4. Plaintiffs have established their probable success on the merits, based on this Court's finding\nthat the plaintiffs' evidence is more credible than that of the defendants.\n5. Plaintiffs have also established irreparable harm, based on this Court's finding that the deputies'\nactions have resulted in irreparable physical and emotional injuries to plaintiffs and the violation of\nplaintiffs' civil rights.\n6. This Court has balanced the equities and found that the irreparable injury to plaintiffs that would\nresult from the denial of a preliminary injunction far outweighs any possible injury that such relief\ncould cause defendants.\n7. The issuance of a preliminary injunction will serve the public interest in that it will prevent, or at\nleast minimize the physical, emotional, and psychological harm being suffered by plaintiffs and the\nLynwood community at the hands of Lynwood area deputies.\n8. To the extent that any of these conclusions of law are deemed findings of fact, they are\nincorporated as findings of fact.\n512 *512 ORRICK, Senior District Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI concur with the majority's holding that appellants have standing to bring this action.\nI respectfully dissent from the rest of the opinion.\nThe majority today holds that a district court, after making findings of fact based upon voluminous documentary\n[1]\nevidence, has no power to enter a preliminary injunction  against a local law enforcement agency without\nholding a full-dress evidentiary hearing. This cannot be the law and, in my opinion, is not the law. The majority is\nonly able to reach this surprising and flawed conclusion by ignoring the standard to be observed by this court in\nreviewing preliminary injunctions, and by blurring the distinction between preliminary and permanent injunctions.\nThe copious record submitted to the district court is replete with shocking allegations supported by declarations.\nAs recited by the majority, plaintiffs brought forward evidence to show unlawful detentions and searches,\nbeatings, shootings, terrorist activities, and destruction of property. More specifically, the declarations included\nevidence that black and hispanic men were repeatedly arrested without cause and severely beaten by deputies\nat the Lynwood station, the County jail, and the \"Operations Safe Streets\" trailer, using guns, flashlights, fists,\nclubs, boots, a brick wall, and an electric Taser gun to inflict injuries that often required medical treatment and left\nsome victims hospitalized. The declarations recounted allegations of torture, such as deputies holding a gun to a\nsuspect's head and threatening to shoot, or actually pulling the trigger without discharging a bullet, and\nallegations of illegal forced entry into residences, followed by a ransacking of the premises under the guise of a\nsearch.\n\nThe majority correctly measures this record by the standard set in Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 375, 96 S.Ct.\n598, 606, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976), which overturned a permanent injunction against a municipal police department\nwhen plaintiffs failed to establish a causal connection between the alleged incidences of police brutality and a\npolicy or plan of the defendant department, sufficient to show that the alleged \"pervasive pattern of intimidation\nflowed from an intentional, concerted, and indeed conspiratorial effort to deprive the [victims] of their\n[constitutional] rights.\" Measured by that standard, the record in this case overwhelmingly supports a finding that\nplaintiffs will probably succeed at trial in proving a pervasive pattern of unlawful conduct. The finding of a causal\nconnection is supported because (1) unlike in Rizzo, several of the deputies alleged to have participated in the\nmisconduct are named defendants, and (2) there are allegations that senior officers in the department knew of\nthe abuse and of the existence of a neo-Nazi, white supremacist gang composed of Lynwood station deputies. At\na minimum, this record containing evidence showing a pervasive pattern of unlawful conduct rising to the level of\na departmental policy justifies a preliminary injunction commanding the deputy sheriffs at the Lynwood station to\nfollow their own rules and to submit monthly reports on complaints of the use of excessive force.\nInstead, faced with this evidence, the majority reverses the district court's decision for failure to hold an\nevidentiary hearing and make \"specific\" factual findings because it finds \"diametrically opposing declarations\" in\nthe record. In so doing, the majority has overstepped this court's power as a reviewing court.\nRule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \"[f]indings of fact, whether based on oral or\ndocumentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.\" (Emphasis added.) The district court has\nmade findings of fact, on which it based its legal conclusions leading to its preliminary injunction order. The\nmajority reverses the district court because no \"specific findings [were made] to support the district court's\n513 general conclusion\" *513 that there is a link between policy makers and the injuries suffered. This\ncharacterization of the district court's findings is misleading. The district court specifically found that plaintiffs who\nwere charged with crimes after they were allegedly brutalized were charged \"pursuant to an unwritten Sheriffs\nDepartment policy of charging a person injured in the course of a routine stop.\" Findings of Fact, ยถ 4 (emphasis\nadded). Further, the district court specifically found that \"departmental policy makers\" knew that Lynwood\ndeputies were members of a neo-Nazi, white supremacist gang. Findings of Fact, ยถ 7. The district court also\nspecifically found that the evidence presented by \"plaintiffs is more credible than that presented by the\ndefendants.\" Findings of Fact, ยถ 11. There is no basis for the majority to make a de novo review of the record\nand, because it is troubled by conflicting declarations, despite the fact that the district court specifically found\nplaintiffs' evidence to be more credible, to require an issue-by-issue resolution of each evidentiary conflict in the\nrecord.\nSuch a searching review is inappropriate under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and is\nespecially inappropriate when the court is reviewing a preliminary injunction. A preliminary injunction is just that 00\n97\npreliminary.\nAs Chief Judge Wallace points out in Zepeda v. United State Immigration & Naturalization Service, 753 F.2d 719,\n724 (9th Cir.1983) (citations omitted) (emphasis added):\nReview of [a preliminary injunction order] is much more limited than review of an order granting or\ndenying a permanent injunction.... Review of factual findings at the preliminary injunction stage is,\nof course, nontestimonial record available to the district court when it granted or denied the\ninjunction motion.\nIn Hunt v. National Broadcasting Co., 872 F.2d 289 (9th Cir.1989), this circuit reiterated the point made in \nZepeda. The Hunt opinion noted \"the nonintrusive nature of our review of the preliminary injunction order\" and\ndiscouraged appeals of future preliminary injunction orders by its speculation about whether such appeals\nrepresent \"`an efficient use of limited judicial facilities.'\" Id. at 293 (quoting Zepeda, 753 F.2d at 724). Keeping in\nmind that this is a preliminary injunction, this court must review these specific findings under the clearly\nerroneous standard.\nThe district court's findings of fact, though conclusory, are \"plausible in light of the record viewed as a whole,\"\neven though necessarily \"based on physical or documentary evidence\" and \"inferences from other facts.\" \n\nAnderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). The efforts of both\nsets of defendants to convince this court that a mistake has been committed are tantamount to urging this court\nto \"weigh[] the evidence differently\" than did the district court. Bessemer, 470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. at 1511\n(quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)).\nUnder Bessemer, this court is not empowered to do so. Given the evidence in the record to support these\nfindings of fact, there is no basis for the holding of the majority, which does not commit itself to any standard of\nreview that the findings are clearly erroneous.\nThe majority, apparently having failed to consider the admonition of Chief Judge Wallace in Zepeda regarding\nreview of preliminary injunctions, or the clear statement of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\ninstead, in essence, reviewed the findings of fact de novo, and, putting itself in place of the district judge, finds\nthem wanting in \"specificity.\" It thus reverses the preliminary injunction, and directs the district judge to conduct\nan evidentiary hearing and explicitly resolve the factual disputes in the record. Not only is this result a\nmisapplication of the standard of review, but the majority has eliminated the distinction between a permanent and\na preliminary injunction.\nThis circuit has already rejected a presumption in favor of evidentiary hearings before deciding preliminary\ninjunction motions. International Molders' & Allied Workers' Local Union, No. 164 v. Nelson 799 F.2d 547, 555\n514 (9th Cir.1986). Instead, this circuit has stated: \"[A]n evidentiary *514 hearing should not be held when the\nmagnitude of the inquiry would make it impractical.\" Id. (emphasis added); see also United States v. Oregon, 913\nF.2d 576, 582 (9th Cir.1990) (citing International Molders' and rejecting an evidentiary hearing before approving\nconsent decree when facts are \"complicated\"). The paper record on which the district court based its findings of\nfact indicates that any evidentiary hearing would be of an impractical magnitude. The parties will have the\nopportunity for a full evidentiary hearing at trial before any permanent injunction will issue. To require a\npreliminary full-dress hearing before trial disserves the values this court sought to uphold in Zepeda, that is,\njudicial efficiency, discouraging appeals of preliminary injunctions, and swift response to preliminary injunction\nrequests. 753 F.2d at 724.\nAs well as reviewing the findings of fact for clear error, this court must determine whether the district court's\ndecision to grant a preliminary injunction based on those findings was an abuse of discretion. Hunt, 872 F.2d at\n292. The district court abused its discretion if it failed to apply the correct legal standard, misapprehended\nunderlying substantive law, or made clear error in judgment. Id. The district judge clearly applied the correct legal\nstandard and understood the substantive law on which a court must base its discretionary decision to grant a\npreliminary injunction. The conclusions of law cite our opinions in Vision Sports, Inc. v. Melville Corp., 888 F.2d\n609 (9th Cir.1989), and Chalk v. United States, 840 F.2d 701 (9th Cir.1988), setting out the well-established law of\npreliminary injunctions. Conclusions of Law, ยถยถ 2, 3. Recognizing that the moving party must show either a\ncombination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm or serious questions\nrequiring litigation and the balance of hardships tipped in its favor, Vision Sports, 888 F.2d at 612, the district\njudge specifically concluded that plaintiffs established probable success on the merits and irreparable harm.\nConclusions of Law, ยถยถ 4, 5. He also balanced the hardships and found that the irreparable harm to plaintiffs,\nshould the violations of departmental rules be allowed to continue, far exceeded any possible harm to defendants\ncaused by requiring them to follow their own rules and, further, that the preliminary injunction would serve the\npublic interest. Conclusions of Law, ยถยถ 6, 7. Applying the correct legal standard to his factual findings that\nplaintiffs' evidence is more credible than defendants' evidence and that the harm is current and on-going\n(Findings of Fact ยถยถ 10, 11), the district judge certainly did not make a clear error of judgment when he ordered\nthe preliminary injunction.\nThe majority focuses on the substantive question of whether plaintiffs will be able to prove a causal connection\nbetween departmental policy and plaintiffs' injuries as required by Rizzo, and on the substantive scope of the\npreliminary injunction. The former concern is ill-founded and the latter does not necessitate reversal.\nThe majority's inquiry into the causal connection between departmental policy makers and plaintiffs' injuries is\npremature, except as it concerns plaintiffs' ability to meet the test for preliminary injunction, i.e., probable success\non the merits or serious questions requiring litigation. This record contains declarations from a great number of\nplaintiffs, witnesses, and defendants, supporting the findings of racially motivated violations of civil rights and use\n\nof excessive force. The district court was entitled to draw the natural, unavoidable, inference that such renegade\n[2]\nbehavior as is alleged here could not take place without the approval of policy makers  and, therefore, that\nplaintiffs had shown probable success on the merits. In any event, as discussed above, to support the grant of a\npreliminary injunction, there need only be serious questions deserving of litigation and a tipping of the balance of\n515 hardships in *515 favor of the moving party. The evidence of a link between departmental policy makers and\nplaintiffs' injuries creates such serious questions and, as also discussed above, the balance of hardships clearly\n[3]\ntips in plaintiffs' favor.\nAgain, I must reiterate that this appeal concerns a preliminary injunction, not a permanent injunction as at issue in\n[4]\nRizzo.  The majority's citation to Orantes-Hernandez v. Thornburgh, 919 F.2d 549 (9th Cir.1990), is inapplicable\nbecause that case involved a permanent injunction subject to much closer scrutiny. Here, without doubt, the\nbalance of hardships tips sharply in favor of plaintiffs. Therefore, plaintiff need only demonstrate that there is a\n\"serious question\" as to this issue deserving of litigation. The findings of fact made below certainly meet that test.\nThe majority also justifies its reversal on the overly broad geographic and substantive scope of the injunction. At\nthe urging of appellants, the district court expanded the geographic scope of the preliminary injunction to cover\nthe entire Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. This expansion was granted to accommodate the\ndefendants. There is, however, no support for such a vast decree. I agree that the preliminary injunction should\nbe limited to deputy sheriffs operating in the jurisdiction of Lynwood substation. Such a limitation can easily be\nplaced on the injunction by way of our final order, however, without vacating the district court's preliminary\ninjunction. I am not overly concerned by the administrative difficulties this creates for the Sheriff's Department.\nThe preliminary injunction is limited to policies \"regarding the use of force and procedures for conducting\nsearches.\" I believe this limitation is crucial. In situations involving the use of force against, or searches of,\ncitizens, rife as they are with the possibility of dangerous and violent confrontations between deputy sheriffs and\nthe public, it should not be too much to ask that deputy sheriffs comply with department policies and regulations.\nThe original proposed order submitted by plaintiffs expanded upon defendants' normal policies and procedures in\nsignificant respects. Rather than interfere with established procedures and policies, the district court instead\nsimply required defendants to comply with the policies already established regarding use of force and searches.\nThis is not a burdensome preliminary injunction by any standard. Indeed, if defendant's arguments are to be\nbelieved, they are already in full compliance with these policies. The district court, however, did not specify\nprecisely which policies and procedures defendants must comply with or face the contempt powers of a federal\ncourt. The majority concludes that the preliminary injunction violates the specificity requirement of Rule 65(d) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nI agree that the policies to be followed by defendants must be specified more particularly. Such minor\namendments, however, do not require that the preliminary injunction be vacated. We should follow our precedent\nset in Davis v. City & County of San Francisco, 890 F.2d 1438, 1450-51 (9th Cir.1989), in which we approved an\ninjunction incorporating San Francisco Fire Department's rules \"already binding upon the officers of the SFFD,\"\nand by separate order required the district court to specify which policies it intended the defendants to follow. The\nDavis court noted that this circuit \"has not taken a rigid approach to Rule 65(d)\" and further explained that the\n\"primary purpose of Rule 65(d) is to assure adequate notice to parties faced with the possibility of contempt.\" Id.\nat 1450. The Davis court specifically noted that \"[i]t is unlikely the officers could argue they were unaware of\n516 these rules.\" Id. Likewise *516 here, the sheriff's deputies cannot contend that they are unaware of their own\npolicies on force and searches. Indeed, defendants boast that \"sheriff's deputies are thoroughly and repeatedly\ntrained with respect to proper escalation of force.\" Where the primary purpose of Rule 65(d) has been\naccomplished, vacating the preliminary injunction would cause undue delay and is unnecessary.\nThere is no doubt that a federal court should be cautious in granting an injunction against state law enforcement\nagencies. See Rizzo, 423 U.S. at 380, 96 S.Ct. at 608 (discussing federalism concerns). We should be unwilling\nto undertake such interference absent the most compelling circumstances. Hesitation is natural and proper in the\nface of such a request. In this case, however, plaintiffs have alleged the most compelling circumstances\nimaginable. Given the limited scope of our review of the district judge's decision, i.e., whether his findings of fact\nare clearly erroneous and whether his conclusions of law indicate an abuse if discretion, I do not believe that the\npreliminary injunction should be overturned. If plaintiffs are correct and there is a white supremacist cell operating\n\nwith official knowledge out of the Lynwood sheriff's department, and these shootings, tortures, beatings,\nharassment, and slurs did in fact take place, then there can be no doubt that the preliminary injunction entered is\nfully justified. Defendants claim that these allegations are lies presented by disreputable gang members at war\nwith authority, and gullibly reiterated by outside lawyers and the press. It is not the role of this tribunal to second\nguess a provisional determination as to this conflict made by the court below.\nIn my view, the preliminary injunction is proper and should stand, after modification on remand as described\nabove. As noted in Zepeda, this ruling would not serve to indicate, in any way, the position this court would take\nafter the development of a full record. 753 F.2d at 724.\n[*] Honorable William H. Orrick, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of California,\nsitting by designation.\n[1] Appellants incorrectly contend that the notice of appeal, filed September 24, 1991, divested the district court of\njurisdiction to file the written findings and conclusions. The findings and conclusions were entered in furtherance\nof the injunction order and they further our review of that order. See Hybritech Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 849\nF.2d 1446, 1450 (Fed.Cir.1988). Appellants have also asked to supplement the record with documents related to\nthe subsequent class certification. Since that certification order was entered independently from the preliminary\ninjunction, we deny the motion.\n[1] The injunction commands that the entire Los Angeles Sheriff's Department follow its own policies and\nguidelines regarding the use of force and conduct of searches and submit to the Court in camera copies of\nreports alleging the use of excessive force that the Department collects monthly.\n[2] The district court specifically found that \"there is a direct link between departmental policy makers, who tacitly\nauthorized deputies' unconstitutional behavior, and the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs.\" Findings of Fact, ยถ 9.\n[3] There is simply no comparison between the beatings and harassment that may continue to be suffered by the\nplaintiffs and the \"inconvenience\" defendants will face in following policies that defendants themselves adopted\nand that they are already obliged to follow.\n[4] While a preliminary injunction was entered by the district court in one of the cases comprising what became \nRizzo, which injunction \"restrain[ed] the police from violating the constitutional rights of citizens,\" Council of\nOrganizations on Philadelphia Police Accountability v. Rizzo, 357 F.Supp. 1289, 1319 (E.D.Pa.1973), that\npreliminary injunction apparently was not the subject of further litigation.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Foltz v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 331\n3\nF.3d 1122, 1132-33 (9th Cir. 2003).  First, the Court must examine the relevance\n4\nof the protected material to the collateral proceedings.  Foltz, 331 F.3d at 1132\n5\n(โ[R]elevance hinges on the degree of overlap in facts, parties, and issues between\n6\nthe suit covered by the protective order and the collateral proceedings.โ).  Second,\n7\nthe Court must weigh the interests of the party opposing modification against judicial\n8\npolicy limiting duplicative discovery.  Foltz, 331 F.3d at 1133.\n9\nFuiava has failed to articulate how access to the requested reports will be\n10\nrelevant to his collateral litigation featuring self-defense.  Instead of explaining how\n11\nthe reports will aid his cause, Fuiava simply lists the reports he wants to discover\n12\nand then makes a conclusory statement that those reports relate to his collateral\n13\naction.  Without a sufficient explanation, this Court cannot evaluate the relevance\n14\nof the reports requested, as called for under Foltz. \n15\nAs to the second factor, the County of Los Angeles asserts that the state court\n16\nhas already determined that the reports of the slain deputy were relevant and that\n17\nother Sheriffโs department reports were irrelevant.  Weighing the Countyโs argument\n18\nfor maintaining the protective order against the judicial policy limiting duplicative\n19\ndiscovery, as called for under the second Foltz factor, the Countyโs position prevails.\n20\nIt is Ordered that the renewed motion to intervene to modify the protective\n21\norder be, and hereby is, Denied. \n22\n23\nDate: February 11, 2009   ___________________________________\n24\nTerry J.

Hatter, District Judge, Presiding \nArgued and Submitted April 6, 2010\" \nPasadena, California \nBefore: FERNANDEZ, SILVERMAN and GRABER, Circuit Judges. \nIntervenor-Appellant Freddie Fuiava's petition for habeas corpus is currently \npending in state court.  The state court partially granted Fuiava's motion under \nCalifornia Penal Code ยง 1054.9 to take additional discovery in support of his \npetition.  Fuiava then moved to intervene in this closed case in the Central District \nof California seeking modification of any protective order covering the discovery \ngenerated during the life of this case.  After the district court denied his motion \nwithout stating a reason for its denial, a panel of this circuit remanded to give the \ndistrict court an opportunity to state the reasons for its ruling.  See Thomas v. \nCounty of L.A., No. 06-56228,275 Fed. Appx. 664 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Foltz v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.  Co., 331 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2003ยป. \nOn remand, the district court again denied the motion to intervene, \nconcluding that Fuiava had not articulated how access to the evidence he sought \nwould be relevant to his collateral litigation.  The district court further concluded \n\"  The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision \nwithout oral argument.  See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2). \n-6-\n\nCase 2:90-cv-05217-TJH   Document 1963   Filed 04/30/10   Page 9 of 9   Page ID #:158\nthat the reliance interest of the County in maintaining the protective order \noutweighed the policy of avoiding duplicative discovery.  Fuiava appealed and we \nnow vacate the district court's order because the motion to intervene to modify the \nprotective order is moot. \nresponse to the panel's inquiries, neither party has identified a protective \n[n \norder that covers the discovery in this case.  Fuiava's motion to intervene seeking \nmodification of a protective order is therefore moot.  No protective order prevents \nFuiava from obtaining the discovery he seeks. \nThe district court's order denying Fuiava's renewed motion to intervene to \nmodify the protective order is VACATED and the case is REMANDED with \ndirections to dismiss the motion as moot. \n-7-",
