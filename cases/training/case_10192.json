    "summary": "<p>On January 21, 2003, a group of Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) prisoners afflicted with Hepatitis-C,  and relying on 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against MDOC officials, as well as individuals and entities providing contract medical services to MDOC prisoners.  Represented by counsel from the ACLU Fund of Michigan and from the Wayne State University Civil Rights Litigation Clinic, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, together with class action status for the case, which alleged violations of federal and state constitutional guarantees against cruel and unusual punishment.  Defendants' deliberate indifference to plaintiffs' medical condition and needs, by providing inadequate testing of and care for the plaintiff class, constituted the unconstitutional conduct, according to the plaintiffs.  The contract medical service providers filed a motion to dismiss, saying that the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies, as 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997c required, before filing their ยง 1983-based claim.</p><p>On July 1, 2003, District Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff granted the defense motion.  His unpublished opinion ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust the MDOC grievance procedure and that,  as he and other courts have interpreted 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997c (a part of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act), the plaintiffs must do so even if the administrative process is such that there is reason to presume in advance that the grievance will be denied.  Moreover, in applying ยง 1997c to this case, Judge Zatkoff followed the \"total exhaustion\" rule, which required that the entire complaint be dismissed without prejudice, until the plaintiffs have completely exhausted the available administrative process.  An appeal of the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit resulted in an unpublished affirmation of the district court on November 4, 2005.  Similarly, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to grant a writ of certiorari to review the case.  Thompson v Overton, 576 U.S. 1185 (2006).</p><p>We have no further information on the status of the case.</p><p></p>",

McAdoo, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly \nsituated, by their attorneys, for their complaint state the following: \nI.  NATUREOFTHECLATMS \n1.  This is a prisoners' civil rights class action for declaratory and injunctive relief against \ndefendants William Overton, Director, Michigan Departmcnt of Corrections (\"MDOC\"), George \nPramstaller, MDOC's Director of Bureau of Health Services, Correctional Medical Services, Inc. \n(\"CMS\"), and Dr. Craig Hutchinson, CMS's director.  Plaintiffs' and plaintiff class claims arise \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234--L-PZ-    - D-oc-um-en-t 1-   _   F iled 0_1/2 1_/.2_0 0_3      Page 2 of 18\n..........  ..  โข..  .........  \nout of the inadequate medical care provided them while incarcerated in various MDOC prison \nfacilities throughout the state. \n2.  This class action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, the Eighth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution, and Article 1, ยง 16 of the Constitution of the State of Michigan.  It \nseeks only declaratory and equitable relieffrom defendants with respect to the conditions of \nplaintiffs' confinement within the MDOC, which conditions constitute cruel and unusual \npunishment under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article 1, \nยง 16 of the Constitution of the State of Michigan. \n3.  The heart of this complaint is that the defendants have been, and continue to be, in \nviolation of the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment in that, by policy, custom and \npractice, they arc deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs' serious medical needs by failing to provide \nadequate testing and treatment for the Hepatitis C Virus (\"HCY\"). Without the testing and \ntreatment herein requested, plaintiffs and those similarly situated suffer an increased risk of, and \nactual grave illness and/or death as the result of undetected and/or untreated HCY infection. \n4.  The Surgeon General of the United States has declared HCY a national epidemic.  There \narc currently more individuals in the United States infected with HCY than with I-IlY, and the \nnumbers arc increasing rapidly.  Already approximately ten thousand people die each year from \ncomplications related to HCY, and that number is expected to at least triple in the next few \ndecades.  Within prisons, the HCY epidemic is of even greater consequence: it is estimated that \nbetween fifteen and forty percent orthe United States' prison population is infected with HCY. \nMost of these people will be released at some point. \n2 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-7....0. -2-3..โข 4--โขL..- P-Z .    - D-ocu-m.e. n-t. ..1 -     . .F iled 01/21/2003     Page 3 of 18\n5.  Existing treatments arc most often effective in the early stages of the disease, and, in \nadvanced cascs, arc contraindicated.  The public health care expense of treating the disease early \nis far less than treatment of the disease (and related complications) in its advanced stagcs. \n6.  Despite the vulnerable nature of the prison population, the HCV tcsting and trcatmcnt of \nMichigan prisoners is constitutionally defectivc.  Defendants' guidelines and protocols for the \ntesting for and treatment on-ICV demonstrate a custom, policy and practice of medical care that, \ninter alia, improperly excludes most at risk inmatcs from proper testing, and most infccted \ninmates from proper treatment.  Additionally, defendants have a policy, custom and practice of \nfailing to adhere to their own constitutionally deficient testing and treatment protocols. \nII.  .JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nยง 1331 in that this action arises under the Constitution of the United States, and pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1343(a), in that plaintiffs seek redress for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctivc relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nยงยง 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  This Court has \nsupplemental jurisdiction over state law claims based on 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367. \n9.  Venue is proper in the Eastern District of Michigan because a substantial part of the \nevents and omissions giving rise to this suit occurred (and arc occurring) within this District. \n10.  The named plaintiffs have exhausted administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1997e(a).  Copies of these Final, Step III, grievance denials arc attached as Exhibit 1. \n3 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 1      Filed 01/21/2003     Page 4 of 18\nIII.  PARTIES \nA.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The Hepatitis C Virus \n22. The Hepatitis C virus is a blood borne virus that causes liver disease.  It is a rapidly \ngrowing national epidemic.  It is currently the most common blood borne infection in the United \nStates.  Over four million Americans - or 1.8% of the United States popUlation - arc currently \ninfected. \n23. About eighty-five percent ofHCV-infccted individuals develop chronic hepatitis, and at \nleast twenty percent of these develop irreversible cirrhosis within two decades of the onset of \ninfection.  Chronic HCV infection also puts one at significantly increased risk for liver cancer \n(\"HCC\"). \n24. Approximately ten thousand Americans die from complications due to HCV each year. \nHCV is one of the most common reasons for liver transplant in the United States. \n25.  HCV is spread primarily through contact with the blood of an infected person. Factors \nthat indicate an increased risk of infection with HCV include: (i) being a child born to an HCV \npositive woman; (ii) service in the armed forces, particularly Vietnam veterans; (iii) receiving \nblood, blood products or an organ transplant before 1992; (iv) long-term kidney dialysis; (v) \n6 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 1      Filed 01/21/2003     Page 7 of 18\nexposure to HeV positive blood or body fluids, including during scx; (vi) a history oftattoos or \nbody piercings; and (vii) a history of IV drug usc. \n26.  Thc majority of people infected with HeV arc asymptomatic.  Around one-third of \ninfected individuals develop symptoms ofliver disease including malaise, weakness, anorexia, \nand jaundice. Many patients will become symptomatic only at the time of development of \nadvanced liver diseasc when existing treatments arc most often not effective or, in many \nadvanced cases, contraindicated. \n27. After initial exposure, HeV can be detected in blood within one to three weeks and is \npresent at the onset of symptoms. Antibodies to Hev arc detected by enzyme immunoassay \n(\"EIA\") in onlyfifty to seventy percent of patients at the onset of symptoms, increasing to more \nthan ninety percent after three months. \n28. Within an average of four to twelve weeks, liver cell injury caused by HeV is often, \nthough not always, manifested by elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (\"ALT\") levels. \n29. Testing for serum ALT levels is the most inexpensive and noninvasive, but relatively \ninsensitive, means of assessing disease activity. \nB.  HCV in Michigan's Prisons \n30. Prisons arc a locus for HeV infection and transmission. \n31. Defendants usc HeV testing and treatment protocols that, on their face, fall far short of \nnationally and locally accepted medical standards for the basic and humane care and treatment of \nHeV infected persons.  These testing and treatment protocols, on their face, constitute deliberate \nindifference to plaintiffs' serious medical needs. \n7 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 1      Filed 01/21/2003     Page 8 of 18\n32. Defendants also have a policy, custom and practicc offa iling to adhere to their \nconstitutionally defective HCV tcsting and trcatment protocols and have, in some cases, failed to \nevcn notify inmates of their HCV positive status. \n33.  Defendants also fail to educate inmates about I-ICV, its causes, methods of transmission, \nconscquences of infection, and available methods of treatment. \n34. While incarcerated, infected prisoners who are untested and thus unaware ofthcir positive \nHC  V -status unknowingly pass the infection to each other, to prison guards, and to health care \nworkers.  When they are released, they may and do unknowingly infect people in thc community. \n35. Further, prisoners - both those who are aware of their HCV-positive status and those who \nare uninformcd - do not receive adequate treatment. \n36. Defendants' policies, procedures, customs, and praetices described herein are likely to \npersist unless enjoined by this Court. \nV.  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n37. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf ofthemsclves and all others similarly situated \npursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2) and (\\)(A). \n38. Plaintiffs request that the Court certify a class consisting of all persons who arc presently \nimprisoned with MDOC and who meet the following conditions: \n(a) her or his blood work or medical or social history indicates that she/he may be \nat risk for HCV; \n(b) she or he is not currently being appropriately tcsted and/or treated for HCV; \nand \n(c) she or he has not declined further testing and/or treatment for HCV. \n8 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 1      Filed 01/21/2003     Page 9 of 18\nโข \n39. This class is properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(a) because the \nrequirements of Rule 23(a) are met, as follows: \n(a) The members of the class arc too numerous to be joined in one \naction.  At the end of 2002, Michigan's inmate population exceeded 49,000.  National and other \nstate estimates suggest that 7,350 -19,600 of these inmates (fifteen to forty percent) may be \ninfected with HCV, and many more are likely to have elevated risk factors for HCV infection \nthat indicate HCV testing would be appropriate.  Joinder of all class members is therefore \nimpracticable. \n(b) Common questions of law and fact exist as to all class members \nand dominate those questions that only affect individual members.  These common questions \ninclude, but are not limited to: \n1.  whether defendants' HCV testing and treatment protocols, on their face, \nconstitute deliberate indifference to plaintiffs' serious medical needs in violation \nof the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, ยง 16 of \nthe Constitution of the State of Michigan; and \n11.  whether defendants have by policy, custom or practice failed to follow their \nown HCV testing and treatment protocols and, if so, whether this failure \nconstitutes deliberate indifference to plaintiffs' serious medical needs in violation \nof the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, ยง 16 of \nthe Constitution of the State of Michigan; \n(c) Plaintiffs' claims arc typical of claims of the class.  All of the \n9 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 1      Filed 01/21/2003     Page 10 of 18\nโข \nnamed plaintiffs arc infected with HCY, and have been denied adequate testing and/or treatment \nby defendants. The claims of the named plaintiffs arc based on the same legal theory as those of \nthe entire class.  The named plaintiffs and plaintiff class both seck declaratory and injunctive \nrelief only. \n(d) Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nclass.  The interests of the class representatives arc consistent with those of the class members. \nPlaintiffs' counsel knows of no conflicts of interest among class members that would affect this \nlitigation nor of any conflicts of interest between the attorneys and cluss members.  Moreover, \nclass counsel is comprised of experienced attorneys who have no eon11ict of interest.  Plaintiffs' \ncounsel have the experience and ability to prosecute this case vigorously. \n40. This action is properly maintainable under Rule 23(b )(2) because defendants have acted or \nhave refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class as a whole, thereby making \nclass-wide declaratory and injunctivc relief appropriate.  This case involves a challenge to the \ndefendants' customs, policies and/or practices, including, but not limited to, defendants' HCY \ntesting and treatment protocols and their implementation.  Defendants' refusal to provide \nadequate testing and treatment has generally, and in important aspects, similarly affected the \nentire proposed class. \n41. This class action is also maintainable under Rule 23(b)(I)(A).  Separate actions would \ncreate a risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class, which \nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for defendants.  Defendants could be subject \nto varying, and possibly conflicting, injunctive and/or declaratory orders. \n10 \n---------------\n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 1      Filed 01/21/2003     Page 11 of 18\n42. Class action treatment provides a fair and efficient method of adjudication for the \ncontroversy herein described, which affects a large number of people for whom joinder is \nimpracticable. This class action provides an effective method whereby the enforcement of the \nrights of plaintiffs and the class members can be fairly managed without unnecessary expense or \nduplication. \nVI.  ALLEGATIONS OF NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nA.  John T.  Thompson \n43. Mr. Thompson was diagnosed with HCY in 1998. \n44. Mr. Thompson has not received routine testing to determine ifhis ALT levels arc \nelevated.  Defendants have failed to follow their own protocol in this regard. \n45. When Mr. Thompson's ALT levels are tested, they arc consistently elevated. \n46. In spite of his elevated ALT levels and his requests, Mr. Thompson has been unlawfully \ndenied referral for ultra-sound and liver biopsy and evaluation for treatment.  Mr. Thompson has \nalso not received adequate information and education about HCY. \nB.  Bettina Schreck \n47. Ms. Schreck was diagnosed with HCY in September 1995, when she was in the Macomb \nCounty Jail. \n48. During the last four years, Ms. Schreck has experienced tremendous HCY -related pain. \nHer symptoms include: severe and stabbing pains in her right side, pains that radiate down her \nback, swollen feet and legs, blurred vision, photosensitivity, gastrointestinal problems, loss of \nappetite, exhaustion, kidney pain, bladder cramps, and swollen neck glands. \n11 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 1      Filed 01/21/2003     Page 12 of 18\n49. Despite having tested positive for HCV, and having elevated ALT levels, she has not \nreccived a liver biopsy or ultrasound to detcnnine the extent of the damage to her liver and \ntreatment options.  Moreover, unless Ms. Schreck fonnally grieves, defendants do not provide \nher with the monitoring and testing called for by their current policy. \n50.  Defendants have also denied Ms. Schreck the appropriate dietary accommodations that \nher condition requires. \n51.  Defendants are unlawfully denying Ms. Schreck basic and humane medical care and \ntreatment for, and infonnation and education about her serious medical needs. \nC.  Gerald Hessel! \n52. Mr. Hessell was diagnosed with HCV in 1998. \n53. Mr. Hessell has experienced tremendous I-ICV -related pain.  His symptoms include mild \nto sharp pains in his upper right quadrant, extreme fatigue, loss of appetite resulting in a weight \nloss of nearly forty pounds in approximately sixteen months. \n54. Mr. Hessell's ALT levels have remained above 148 - well above the upper nonnallimit \nfor over twenty months. \n55. Despite his elevated ALT levels and significant symptoms, Mr. Hessell has not received \nadequate follow-up testing and/or trcatment.  Indeed, Mr. Hessell has not rcceived treatment of \nany kind for HCV. \n56. Dr. Aldabagh, a CMS physician, told Mr. I-Iessell that the cost of the testing was a factor \nin Mr. Hessell's inadequate monitoring and treatment. \n57. Defendants have unlawfully denied Mr. Hessell adequate testing and treatment for and \neducation and infonnation about his serious medieal needs. \n12 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 1      Filed 01/21/2003     Page 13 of 18\nD.  Donald Ward \n58. Mr. Ward was diagnosed with HCV in 1994 and his diagnosis was confirmed in August \n2000.  His ALT levels have been elevated for over three years, and he has not been tested at \nregular intervals. \n59. Despite his condition, defendants have denied Mr. Ward a liver biopsy or ultrasound, and \nany treatment these tests might demonstrate is medically necessary.  Mr. Ward has not received \nadequate education about HCV. \n60. Defendants have unlawfully denied Mr. Ward adequate testing and treatment for, and \neducation and information about his serious medical needs. \nE.  Kenneth Alexander \n61. Mr. Alexander was diagnosed with HCV in 1998. \n62. Defendants have failed to conduct blood draws in two-month intervals to test Mr. \nAlexander's ALT levels. \n63. Defendants have unlawfully denied Mr. Alexander the testing his condition requires, \nincluding a liver biopsy and ultrasound, and the treatment, if any, those tests might demonstrate \nis medically necessary.  Mr. Alexander has also not received adequate education and information \nabout HCV. \nF.  Henr)! Torrez \n64. Mr. Torrez was diagnosed with HCV in June 1996. \n65. Mr. Torrez's ALT levels have been abnormally elevated since January of 1990. \n66. In January 2002, Mr. Torrez was approved for Hepatitis C treatment.  Treatment began six \nmonths later on May 30, 2002. \n13 \n\nCase 2:03-_c.v_--70-23-4-L-PZ-     -Do-cum-en-t 1-     - Fil-ed -01/-21-/20-03 -    P-ag-e 1-4 o-f 1-8 -----\n_ ..... \n67. MDOC's Bureau of Health Care discontinued Mr. Torrez's Hepatitis C on June 24, 2002, \ndue to Mr. Torrez's alleged depression.  The Bureau based this determination on a Center for \nEpidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale completed by a nurse that misrepresented Mr. \nTorrez's mental condition.  The discontinuation of Mr. Torrez's treatment was wrongly \npredicated on false medical conclusions. \n68. Moreover, even if the CES-D was accurate, it was a medically inappropriate basis for \ndiscontinuing his treatment. \n69. Defendants have unlawfully denied Mr. Torrez continued treatment for his Hepatitis C, \nand information and education about his serious medieal needs. \nG.  Silas McAdoo \n70. Mr. MeAdoo was diagnosed with HCV in 1995. \n71. Mr. MeAdoo's symptoms include: dark urine, fatigue, aches, flu-like symptoms, low \ngrade fever, mild abdominal pain, and psychiatric symptoms believed to be caused by increased \nblood ammonia levels due to liver disease. \n72. Mr. MeAdoo's ALT levels have been abnormalIy elevated since 1995. \n73. Defendants have unlawfully denied Mr. McAdoo information and education about his \nserious medical needs, a liver biopsy and ultrasound, regular monitoring, and any course of \ntreatment that these tests might demonstrate is medically necessary for his serious medical needs . \n.,   VII.  CLAIMS \n74. By employing HCV testing and treatment protocols that are medically inappropriate and \ninsufficient on their face in that they do not reflect the community standard of care, defendants, \nacting under color of state law, by policy, custom, andlor practice, have demonstrated deliberate \n14 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 1      Filed 01/21/2003     Page 15 of 18\nindifference to plaintiffs' serious medical needs, subjecting plaintiffs and those similarly situated \nto cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution as actionable under 42 U.S.C ยง 1983.  These same acts also violate Article 1, ยง 16 \nof the Constitution of the State of Michigan. \n75.  By failing to abide by their own deficient HCV testing and treatment protocols, \ndefendants, acting under color of state law, by policy, custom, and/or practice, have \ndemonstrated deliberate indifference to plaintiffs' serious medical needs, subjecting plaintiffs \nand those similarly situated to cruel and unusual punishment in violation ofthc Eighth \nAmendment ofthe Unitcd Statcs Constitution as actionable undcr 42 U.S.C ยง 1983.  These same \nacts also violate Article 1, ยง 16 of the Constitution of the State of Michigan. \n76. By failing to cducate prisoners about HCV, by denying them the right to spccial \nassociation by forming support and othcr groups rcgarding thc disease, and by failing to take \nreasonable precautions to prevcnt the further transmission of the disease, defendants, acting \nunder color of state law, by policy, custom, and/or practice, have demonstrated delibcratc \nindifference to plaintiffs' serious medical needs, subjecting plaintiffs and those similarly situated \nto crucl and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amcndment of the United States \nConstitution as actionable under 42 U.S.C ยง 1983.

ZATKOFF \nCHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThis matter is before the Court on Defendants CMS and Hutchinson's Motion to Dismiss. \nPlaintiffs responded and Defendants CMS and Hutchinson replied. The Court finds that the parties \nhave adequately set forth the relevant law and facts, and that oral argument would not aid in the \ndisposition of the instant motion.  See E.D. MICH. LR 7. 1( e)(2).  Accordingly, thc Court ORDERS \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 18      Filed 07/01/2003     Page 2 of 10\nโข \nthat the motion be decided on the briefs submitted.  For the reasons set forth herein, Defendants \nCMS and Hutchinson's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs are prisoners who are currently incarccrated by the Michigan Departmcnt of \nCorrections (hereinafter \"MDOC\"). The named Defendants include the Director of the MDOC, as \nwell as individuals and entities that provide mcdical scrvices to prisoners who are incarccrated at \nMDOC facilities.  Each Plaintiff is incarcerated at a differcnt MDOC facility, and collectively, \nPlaintiffs allege that they represent all similarly incarcerated individuals.  In their Complaint, \nPlaintiffs allege a violation of 42 U.S.C.  ยง 1983;  in  particular,  they allege  that their Eighth \nAmendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment was violated by Defendants, who \nare state actors acting undcr color of state law.  In addition, Plaintiffs also allege a violation of \nArticle 1, ยง 16 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, which is substantially identical to the Eighth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. \nPlaintiffs state that they arc all infected with the Hepatitis C Virus (hereinafter \"HCV\"), and \nthat Defendants have been deliberately indifferent towards Plaintiffs' serious medical needs by \nfailing to  provide adequate testing and treatmcnt for those prisoncrs infected with the virus. \nSpecifically,  Plaintiffs'  Complaint alleges  the  following:  first,  Defendants'  HCV testing and \ntreatment protocol does not meet nationally recognized standards, and is constitutionally deficient; \nand second, Defendants have a policy of often failing to follow their own deficient protocol.  Each \nindividual Plaintiff alleges that he or she was diagnosed with HCV, and that Defendants fail cd to \ntreat him or her pursuant to Defendants' deficient protocol; Plaintiffs allege that the care that they \n2 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 18      Filed 07/01/2003     Page 3 of 10\nโข \nwould have received under Defendants' deficient protocol would have been better than the total lack \nof treatment that they in fact receivcd.  Plaintiffs state that they bring this action on behalf of \nthemselves  and  all  similarly  situated  individuals;  in  short,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  they  arc \nrepresentatives ofa class ofincarcerated individuals who have also been subjected to Defendants' \ndeliberate indifference. \nDefendants  Correctional  Mcdieal  Services,  Inc.,  (hereinafter \"Defendant  CMS\")  and \nDefendant Dr.  Craig Hutchinson,  (hereinafter \"Defendant Hutchinson\") who  is a director of \nDefendant  CMS,  provide  medical  services  to  incarcerated  inmates.  Defendants  CMS  and \nHutchinson bring this current Motion to Dismiss based on the following arguments: \n1.  Although Plaintiffs appear to have proeecded through Step III of the MDOC grievance \nprocedure, Plaintiffs failed  to  attach  to  their Complaint any document other than the \nresolution page of their Step III review.  Thus, Plaintiffs failed to describe the nature of the \ngrievance filed, thus making it impossible to determine whether said Defendants had been \ngiven an opportunity to respond to the issues raised in Plaintiffs' Complaint. \n2.  Plaintiffs present no evidence that they ever filed a grievance against either Defendant CMS \nor Defendant Hutchinson, and in fact, Plaintiffs never filed a grievance against either of said \nDefendants. \n3.  Plaintiffs failed to file a grievance regarding all of the claims in their Complaint, thus \nPlaintiffs failed to exhaust their remedies. \n4.  Plaintiffs' claims against Defendants eMS and Hutchinson that arise under the Michigan \nConstitution arc barred by Michigan law. \n5.  Plaintiffs fail to state a claim of deliberate indifference to their serious medical condition by \nDefendants CMS and Hutchinson. \n6.  Plaintiffs only allegation ofd eliberate indifference is based merely on a difference in medical \nopinion, and docs not rise to a constitutional violation. \nMany of Defendants CMS and Hutchinson's arguments arc based on 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e. \nUnder federal law ,a prisoner is required to exhaust all administrative remedics before he or she may \n3 \n\n-------\n.------ ----\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LP-Z-- - - -  -D---o-c-ument 18      Filed 07/01/2003     Page 4 of 10\nโข \nfile an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a). Prior to bringing this cause \nof action, each individual Plaintifff iled an administrative grievance with thc MDOC. Under MDOC \nregulations, there arc three steps to the grievance process, with the final review being entitled \"Step \nIII.\" Defendants argue, and Plaintiffs implicitlyconcede, that none ofthe individual Plaintiffs in this \naction  filed  a  grievance  alleging  that  Defendants'  HCV  testing  and  treatment  protocol  is \nconstitutionally deficient. \nThe Court shall evaluate said Defendants' arguments in the most logical ordcr. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA motion brought pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted tests the legal sufficiency of Plaintiffs' claims. The Court must accept as true \nall factual allegations in the pleadings, and any ambiguities must be resolved in Plaintiffs' favor. \nSee Jackson v. Ric1zards Med. Co., 961 F.2d 575, 577-78 (6th Cir. 1992). The Court, however, need \nnot accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.  See Morgan v.  Church's \nFried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 12 (6th Cir. 1987). The Court may properly grant a motion to dismiss \nwhen no set offacts exists that would allow Plaintiffs to recover. See Carter by Carter v. Cornwall, \n983 F.2d 52, 54 (6th Cir. 1993). \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nIn their motion to dismiss, Defendants CMS and Hutchinson give six reasons for why \nPlaintiffs' Complaint should be dismissed. Defendants CMS and Hutchinson's first three arguments, \nhowever, run together. Basically, Defendants CMS and Hutchinson argue that Plaintiffs arc required \n4 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 18      Filed 07/01/2003     Page 5 of 10\nโข \nto exhaust the MDOC grievance procedure before they are permitted to bring an action in this Court. \nIn addition, Plaintiffs are required to  specifically plead facts  that demonstrate that thcy have \nexhausted the MDOC grievance procedure for each of the claims in their Complaint.  Defendants \nCMS and Hutchinson assert that Plaintiffs failed to specifically plead such facts.  Based on this \nassertion, Defendants CMS and Hutchinson make the following three arguments: 1) Plaintiffs only \nproof that they submittcd their claims to the MDOC gricvanee procedure are the resolution pagcs \nfor the final, Step III review of each Plaintiff's grievance, and that such resolution pages do not list \neach Plaintiff's individual grievances; 2) similarly, Defendants CMS and Hutchinson were never \nnamed in any ofthese grievances; and 3) there is no proofthat each claim by each individual Plaintiff \nhas been fully exhaustcd. \nSaid Defendants argument regarding failure to cxhaust shall now be applied to Defendant's \ndeficient protocol claim. \nA.  Deficient Protocol \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a) states that a prisoner may not bring a cause of action regarding \"prison \nconditions\" until \"such administrative remedies as arc available are exhausted.\"  42 U.S.C.  ยง \n1997c(a); see also Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 520 (2002).  The Sixth Circuit stated that the \nreasons for this exhaustion requirement is to allow States an opportunity to exercise their authority \nover their own prison systems, and to give States a chance to utilize their expertise over grievances \nthat arise on a routine basis.  See Brown v.  Toombs, 139 F.3d 1102, 1103 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting \nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411  U.S. 475, 491-92 (1973ยป; see also Porter, 534 U.S. at 524-25 (\" ... \nCongrcss afforded eorrcetions officials time and opportunity to address complaints intemallybefore \nallowing the initiation of a federal case.\").  Consequently, the Court finds that Plaintiffs were \n5 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 18      Filed 07/01/2003     Page 6 of 10\nโข \nrequired to exhaust their administrative remedies-specifically, the MDOC grievance proeedure \nbefore filing this action. \nAs mentioned above, no  individual Plaintiff filed  a grievance regarding the allegedly \nconstitutionally deficient HCV testing and treatment protocol. Plaintiffs argue, however, that their \nfailure to file a grievance on this issue is excused because ยง 1997e only requires them to exhaust \n\"available\" administrative remedies.  Plaintiffs contend that they had no administrative remedies \navailable to them for their deficient protocol claim because the MDOC's grievance policy only \npermits prisoners to file grievances regarding \"the application of a policy or procedure if it affects \nhim/her personally.  .. ,\" and docs not permit a prisoner to \"grieve the content of policy or \nprocedure.\" MDOC PD 03.02.130(E). Similarly, the MDOC's policy states that a prisoner may not \ngrieve \"the content of administrative rules, policy directives, operating procedures and Director's \nOffice Memoranda;\" or \"Issues which affect the entire prisoner population or significant numbers \nof prisoners.\" MDOC PD 03.02.l30(F)(1) & (4). In short, Plaintiffs argue that, pursuant to MDOC \npolicy, they wcrc not permitted to file a grievance challenging Defendants' policy regarding the \ntesting and treatment ofI-ICV, which is the crux of their deficient protocol claim, and that they \ncannot be required to exhaust an administrative remedy that is not available.  See, e.g., Miller v. \nNorris, 247 F.3d 736, 740 (8th Cir. 2001) (holding that a prisoner is not required to exhaust all \nremedies, but only ones that are available). \nThe Court is neither persuaded by Plaintiffs' argument, nor with the cases that Plaintiffs rely \nupon.  The Supreme Court in Parler makes clear that prisoners must give prison officials an \nopportunity to remedy any complaint.  This is true even if the grievance procedure is not '''plain, \nspeedy, or effective, '\" and even if \"the prisoner seeks relief not available in grievance proceedings. \n6 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ  . . . .D.- -o.c. u-m-_e._n-t- _1 8. . _     . .F...i.l.e _.d .. โข0- 7/_01/.20_03 -    -Pa-ge 7 of 10\nโข \n. ..\"   See Porter 534 U.S.  at  524 (citing Booth v.  Churner,  532 U.S.  731,  739-40 (2001ยป. \nCommenting on the scope of ยง 1997e, the Supreme Court remarked that \"exhaustion is now required \nfor all 'action[s] ... brought with respect to prison conditions. '\" See id. at 525 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1997e(aยป. Therefore, given the breadth ofยง 1997e, the purposes behind it, as well as the Supreme \nCourt's interpretation of it, the Court finds that Plaintiffs were required to present their deficient \nprotocol claim in a form of a grievance to the proper MDOC officials, even if there is reason to \npresume that such a grievance will be denied. \nThere is no dispute that Plaintiffs did not grieve the MDOC's protocol for testing and treating \nHCV.  Plaintiffs do not even attempt to argue that they have exhausted their state law remedies for \ntheir deficient protocol claims. Accordingly, the MDOC was never given an opportunity to respond \nto such a grievance, even if such a grievance would presumably be denied.  Therefore, Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust their administrative remedies for their deficient protocol claims. \nB.  Total Exhaustion \nDefendants argue that because Plaintiffs failed to completely exhaust their deficient protocol \nclaim that Plaintiffs' Complaint should be dismissed without prejudice in its entirety.  Defendants \nargue that a number of courts, including the Eighth Circuit and the Western District of Michigan, \nhave held that if a prisoner fails to completely exhaust each of his or her claims, then the prisoner's \ncomplaint should be dismissed.  See Graves v.  Norris, 218 F.3d 884 (8th Cir. 2000); see also \nSmeltzer v. Hook, 235 F. Supp. 2d 736 (W.O. Mich. 2002). This is known as the \"total exhaustion\" \nrule. \nThere is a debate between a number of U.S. district courts as to the total exhaustion rule, and \nwhether it comports with Congress' intent in drafiing ยง 1997e(a).  Compare Smeltzer v. Hook, 235 \n7 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 18      Filed 07/01/2003     Page 8 of 10\nโข \nF. Supp. 2d 736 (W.D. Mich. 2002) with Hattley v. Goord, 2003 WL 1700435 (S.D.N.Y. March 27, \n2003). The Court finds Smeltzer to be more persuasive. In particular, upon examining the statutory \nlanguage, the Court notes that ยง 1997e(a) states: \"No action shall be brought with respect to prison \nconditions under section 1983 of this titlc, or any other fcderallaw, by a prisoner confined in any jail, \nprison,  or other correctional  facility  until  such  administrative  remedies  as  arc  available  arc \nexhausted.\"  42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a) (emphasis added).  An action is distinct from a claim for rclief. \nAccording to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and action is commenced when a party files a \ncomplaint.  See FED. R. CIY. P. 3.  There may bc several claims for relief in a particular action, \nhowevcr. See FED. R. CIY. P. 8.  Congress did not usc the word \"claim,\" but rather, it uscd the word \n\"action,\" which indicates to the Court that a prisoner must exhaust all claims before he or she may \nfile an action.  See Graves, 218 F.3d at 885; Smeltzer, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 743-44.  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs' action shall be dismisscd without prejudice, thereby allowing Plaintiffs to exhaust their \nun exhausted remedics. \nAs for Plaintiffs' argument that Smcltzcr is contrary to Sixth Circuit precedent, the Court is \nnot pcrsuaded. Plaintiffs' argument relics on Hartsfield v.  Vidor, 199 F.3d 305 (6th Cir. 1999) and \nBurton v. Jones, 321 F.3d 569 (6th Cir. 2003). In Burton, the Sixth Circuit stated: \"[T]heHartsfield \nholding  illustratcs  that  a  prisoner's  lawsuit,  which  alleges  multiple  claims  against  multiple \ndefendants, is not vulnerable to dismissal under ยง 1997c(a) simply because the prisoncr has failed \nto exhaust a particular claim as to a specific dcfendant.\"  Burton, 321 F.3d at 575 n.2.  Thc Court \nnotes, however, the issue of total exhaustion was not before the Sixth Circuit in either Hartsfield, \nor Burton, and that the Sixth Circuit's comments on the topic arc merely dicta. Further, unpublished \ndecisions by the Sixth Circuit indicatcs that the Sixth Circuit has not definitively hcld that it has \n8 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 18      Filed 07/01/2003     Page 9 of 10\nโข \nrejected the total exhaustion rule. Compare McElhalley v. Elo, No. 98-2173, 2000 WL 1477498, at \n*3 (6th Cir. Sept. 25,2000) with Kemp v. JOlles, 42 Fed. Appx. 744, 745 (6th Cir. 2002).  In fact, \nthe Sixth Circuit has explicitly stated that it has decided to \"reserve to another day\" the question of \nwhether a prisoner's complaint that contains both exhausted and unexhausted elaims should be \ndismissed in its entirety.  See Klluckles EI v. Toombs, 215 F.3d 640, 641-42 (6th Cir. 2000). \nTherefore, the Court finds that because Plaintiffs' Complaint contains unexhausted claims, \nand because Complaints by prisoners with unexhausted claims should be dismissed without \nprejudice, this Court finds that this action should be dismissed, and that it is unnecessary for the \nCourt to decide any other issues at this time. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendants CMS and Hutchinson's Motion to Dismiss is \nGRANTED.'  The Court HEREBY ORDERS that this action shall be DISMISSED WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE to allow Plaintiffs to properly exhaust their claims. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated:_.l_UL_01_'2.003 \n'Even though Defendants William Overton and George Pramstaller did not join in \nDefendants' CMS and Hutchinson's Motion to Dismiss, the Court finds, for reasons set forth \nabove, that Plaintiffs' Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety. \n9 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-70234-LPZ     Document 18      Filed 07/01/2003     Page 10 of 10\n----~----.-----.--. --.--.~--------\n~\\ (~<i 'O/'\"R~ ~ \n\". \na~ยท~~ \nDEPUTY CLERK ",
