The action was filed in 1996, and in 2002, the Honorable Constance Baker Motley, U.S.D.J., issued a comprehensive injunction mandating a wide range of services and establishing procedures for the provision of those services (the \"Injunction\"). Accordingly, it will promote the just, speedy, and efficient resolution of both the pending motion and the litigation as a whole to update the record. In order to assist in that process, it is appropriate to appoint a Special Master to collect information and report to the Court with respect to the current status of provision of educational services at DOC facilities. The expertise of the Special Master will provide for a more efficient and reliable fact-finding process. The Special Master in this case is appointed pursuant to Rule 53(a) (1) (C) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Court's inherent authority. The Court appoints Peter E. Leone, Ph.D., as Special Master. (Signed by Magistrate Judge James C. Francis on 6/10/2014) Copies Mailed By Chambers. (tro) (Entered: 06/10/2014)"

All eligible inmates shall be provided a minimum of 3 hours of educational services every school day. 2. Placement in a restricted housing unit does not change an eligible inmate's entitlement to educational services under any provision of this Order. 3. Unless stated explicitly to the contrary, any and all requirements set forth in this Order shall apply to all of the schools, educational programs, and methods of instruction operated by DOE in DOC facilities. 4. DOC shall ensure that each eligible inmate is provided access to educational services consistent with this Order in a timely manner, including if necessary providing escorts for travel to and from his or her place of educational instruction. Special Education Services 5. Inmates who are disabled and identified as in need of special education or related services shall receive such services, including when placed in a restricted housing unit or method of instruction. If necessary, an Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\") or Special Education Plan (\"SEP\") may be modified in accordance with 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d) and 34 C.F.R. § 300.324, consistent with legitimate penal objectives. In the event this occurs, such modifications shall be the least restrictive necessary to accommodate the security needs of the jail. Reappointment of Special Master 6. The Court appoints Dr. Peter Leone to continue as this Court's expert and monitor to serve a two-year term from the date of this Order, subject to any continuance by order of this Court. The monitor will assess the DOE and DOC's compliance with this Order and provide this Court and counsel with semi-annual reports specifically identifying any areas of noncompliance. Dr. Leone in his reports may also recommend specific changes in DOE and DOC policies and procedures. 7. Dr. Leone shall continue to have the same access to Rikers Island, to plaintiffs and defendants, and to relevant documents, as well as the same arrangement for compensation and reimbursement of expenses, as set forth in this Court's June 10, 2014 Order. Modification and Enforcement 8. Any party may move for reconsideration of any part of this Order within thirty days of its entry. This Order will remain in full force and effect during the pendency of any motion for reconsideration unless and until this Court provides otherwise. Any motion for reconsideration must comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court's Local Rules, and relevant case law. 9. After thirty days following entry of this Order, any party may seek modification of this Order only if there has been a material change in circumstances or within thirty days of issuance of one of the monitor's semi-annual reports. 10. Either party may move to enforce or terminate this Order under the governing legal standards established by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, any relevant statutes, and applicable case law.

    "summary": "<p>On August 14, 1996, eleven incarcerated individuals between the ages of 16 and 21 at Rikers Island filed this class-action lawsuit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York under 42 U.S.C.&sect; 1983, alleging that the New York City Department of Corrections, the New York City Board of Education, and the New York State Department of Education had not provided them with the educational services they were entitled to under federal and state law. Plaintiffs were represented by the Prisoners' Rights Project of Legal Aid Society. The district court (Judge Constance B. Motley) granted plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment, finding the city liable for failure to provide adequate general and special educational services to the class. Handberry v. Thompson, 92 F.Supp.2d 244 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).</p>\r\n<p>In April of 2000, the city submitted to the court its \"Education Plan\" and the court approved the plan on June 29, 2000 and appointed a monitor to observe the plan for one year. The monitor submitted her plan in December of 2001 and the district court concluded that the city failed to meet its obligations under federal and state law. Specific problems included inadequate procedures for informing inmates of their right to receive educational services, scheduling conflicts between educational services and other services, such as health, religious, and exercise activities, and lack of a procedure to determine whether an inmate had already completed a GED. The court (Judge Constance B. Motley) issued an Order Amending the City Defendants' Education Plan, outlining specific steps to be taken by the city. Handberry v. Thompson, 219 F.Supp.2d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).</p>\r\n<p>Defendants moved for a stay pending their appeal of the court's injunction. On November 27, 2002, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an order vacating the injunction and remanding the case for the district court to determine whether the plaintiffs were required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing the class action lawsuit. The district court concluded that no further exhaustion was required, and reinstated the earlier injunction on December 20, 2002. The City Defendants again appealed. The Second Circuit affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. The Court of Appeals held that Section 802 of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3626(a)(1), limits the availability of prospective relief in prisoner litigation to that remedying violations of federal, but not state, law. Id. at 344-46.</p>\r\n<p>The city moved to stay certain provisions of the Order and the district court (Judge Constance B. Motley) denied the motion on April 4, 2004. Handberry v. Thompson, No. 96 Civ. 6161(CBM), 2003 WL 1797850 (S.D.N.Y.). The case was reassigned to to Judge Deborah A. Batts on October 7, 2005. On February 13, 2007, she recused herself. The case was reassigned to Judge George B. Daniels on February 16, 2007, and then the case was assigned to the Magistrate Judge James C. Francis for general pretrial on October 2, 2013.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2014, the court appointed a special master to collect information and report to the Court with respect to the current status of provision of educational services at DOC facilities, pursuant to Rule 53(a)(1)(C). The court appointed Peter E. Leone, Ph.D., as Special Master on order to provide for a more efficient and reliable fact-finding process; the defendants objected but the court overruled. On December 2, 2015, following nine years of litigation, Magistrate Judge Francis filed a report and recommendation granting plaintiffs' motion in part for an amended injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On December 31, 2016 Judge Daniels ordered various provisions relating to educational services, such as ordering that all eligible inmates be provided a minimum of 3 hours of educational services every school day, and that the DOC must provide special education services to those inmates identified as in need. The judge also recommended that special master Dr. Leone be appointed for a two-year term to monitor and ensure compliance by the DOC and DOE. The city objected, but the court overruled and adopted the magistrate&rsquo;s recommendations in full on March 31, 2016.

New York.\nMarch 13, 2000.\n245 *245 Legal Aid Society, by Dori Lewis, Mary Lynne Werlwas, for Plaintiffs.\nThe City of New York Law Department, by Janice Birnbaum, Office of the New York State Attorney General, by\nChristina Leonard, New York City, for Defendants.\nOPINION GRANTING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\nMOTLEY, District Judge.\nOPINION\nFollowing oral argument on January 7, 2000 this court granted plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment that the\nCity defendants failed to provide adequate educational services to members of the plaintiff class at all Rikers\nIsland facilities. The court ordered City defendants to file a plan for providing full and complete educational\nfacilities and services to all eligible inmates on Rikers Island. The following outlines the court's reasoning in\ngranting this motion for declaratory judgment pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and\n2202.\nBACKGROUND\nThis case involves a class action brought by inmates in the custody of the New York City Department of\nCorrection (\"DOC\") claiming violation of federal and state laws in the failure to provide them with adequate\ngeneral and special educational services. Plaintiffs are a class of individuals aged 16 through 21 years who are in\nthe custody of DOC and are entitled to educational services. Defendants are the New York City Board of\nEducation, DOC, and certain City officials sued in their official capacities (collectively referred to as the \"City\ndefendants\") and Richard Mills, the Commissioner of the New York State Education Department.\nThe plaintiff class is comprised of school age inmates (inmates between the ages of 16 and 21 years) who are\nheld in 16 DOC jails, including 10 facilities on Rikers Island. The majority of class members are pre-trial\ndetainees and the minority are post-conviction inmates serving sentences of up to one year's duration. Plaintiffs\nestimate that approximately 2,800 incarcerated youngsters were eligible for educational services at the time this\ncase was filed in 1996. See Pls.' Mem. of Law at 3.\nPlaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the United States Constitution, the Individuals with Disabilities\nin Education Act (the \"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101\net seq., and the New York State Constitution, statutory law and regulations.\n246 *246 Plaintiffs' claims involve both general and special education. Plaintiffs claim that numerous class members\nreceived no or extremely limited educational instruction for significant periods of time in violation of the general\neducation laws. Plaintiffs also estimate that approximately 40% of the class members require special education\nservices due to various disabilities. See Pls.' Mem. of Law at 2. Plaintiffs claim defendants violated the IDEA as\n\nwell as state law by failing to provide appropriate special education services to this substantial portion of the\nincarcerated population.\nSTANDARD FOR DECLARATORY OR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nThis court granted plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment that the City defendants have failed to provide\nadequate educational services to class members in the facilities on Rikers Island. This order is equivalent to the\ngranting of summary judgment establishing liability. This circuit recognizes the value of summary judgment to\nexpedite the process of litigation. See Quinn v. Syracuse Model Neighborhood Corp., 613 F.2d 438, 445 (2d Cir.\n1980). The mechanism of summary judgment promotes judicial economy by preventing further litigation on an\nissue with an unalterably predetermined outcome. The standard for summary judgment ensures that issues are\nefficiently resolved without compromising the rights of the non-moving party.\nSummary judgment may be granted only if the moving party can show that there is no genuine\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\nThe court must draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all ambiguities in favor of the non-\nmoving party.\nAmetex Fabrics, Inc. v. Just In Materials, Inc., 140 F.3d 101, 107 (2d Cir.1998) (internal citations omitted). Thus,\nthe mere existence of a factual dispute between parties does not preclude summary judgment when the dispute\nis not genuine or when the disputed facts are immaterial. A disputed fact is immaterial when the outcome of the\ncase remains the same regardless of the disputed issue. Factual questions which prove immaterial fail to\npreclude summary judgment. See Knight v. U.S. Fire Insurance Co., 804 F.2d 9, 11 (2d Cir.1986) (noting that the\nexistence of unresolved immaterial issues does not suffice to defeat a motion for summary judgment).\nA party may not rely on \"mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion\nfor summary judgment\". Knight v. U.S. Fire Insurance Co., 804 F.2d 9, 11 (2d Cir.1986).\nNor are judges any longer required to submit a question to a jury merely because some evidence\nhas been introduced by the party having the burden of proof, unless the evidence be of such a\ncharacter that it would warrant the jury in finding a verdict in favor of that party. Formerly it was\nheld that if there was what is called a scintilla of evidence in support of a case the judge was\nbound to leave it to the jury, but recent decisions of high authority have established a more\nreasonable rule, that in every case, before the evidence is left to the jury, there is a preliminary\nquestion for the judge, not whether there is literally no evidence, but whether there is any upon\nwhich a jury could properly proceed to find a verdict for the party producing it, upon whom the\nonus of proof is imposed.\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (internal citations\nomitted).\nThe possibility that a material issue of fact may exist does not suffice to defeat the motion; upon\nbeing confronted with a motion for summary judgment the party opposing it must set forth\narguments or facts to indicate that a genuine issue not merely one that is colorable of material fact\nis present.\nGibson v. American Broadcasting Companies, 892 F.2d 1128, 1132 (2d Cir.1989).\n247  DEFENDANTS' CROSS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n*247\nIn granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment this court in effect also denied defendants' cross motion for\nsummary judgment. The court now turns its attention to the various theories under which defendants sought to\nhave this case dismissed.\n\nMOOTNESS\nThis suit cannot be dismissed for mootness. Plaintiffs have offered uncontradicted evidence that defendants\nroutinely failed to provide adequate educational services to class members at the time this suit commenced in\n1996. It is undisputed that the educational services provided to inmates in New York prisons have improved in the\npast four years. In the case of a meritorious and lengthy class action it would be disheartening if improvements\ndid not occur during the duration of the law suit. However, even if such improvements were significant enough to\nraise the educational services up to the level required by law, plaintiffs' claims would still survive any challenge of\nmootness as the controversy could easily recur. Absent a declaratory judgment that past practices violated class\nmembers' rights, defendants might allow the services provided to slip below the acceptable level. See Desiderio\nv. NASD, 191 F.3d 198, 202 (2d Cir.1999)(holding that a voluntary change in defendants' policies did not render\nthe controversy moot because defendants might later amend their policy to revert to the challenged practice).\nThus, even if defendants could show that the educational services currently provided adequately served all class\nmembers, the controversy is still not mooted.\nABSTENTION\nDefendants have argued that the court should abstain from adjudicating this case. Defendants' abstention\nargument may be charitably described as misguided. The abstention doctrine applies only in rare circumstances\nto promote federal-state comity by preventing federal courts from rendering a decision which would disrupt the\nestablishment of a coherent state policy. See Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 704-5, 112 S.Ct. 2206, 119\nL.Ed.2d 468 (1992). This circuit has noted that application of the abstention doctrine requires the existence of\nthree conditions: 1) unclear state law, 2) resolution of a federal issue depending upon resolution of this lack of\nclarity in the state law, and 3) the existence of an interpretation of the state law that avoids the federal\nconstitutional question presented. See Planned Parenthood of Dutchess-Ulster, Inc. v. Steinhaus, 60 F.3d 122,\n126 (2nd Cir.1995). Far from challenging the constitutionality of state statutes, plaintiffs simply seek to enjoy the\nbenefits promised by those statutes. Even if the parties genuinely dispute how many hours of instruction New\nYork law requires, this court may easily establish defendants' liability when no hours of instruction were provided\nto many class members. Even if the parties genuinely dispute the extent to which New York law requires\naccommodation of special educational needs, this court may easily establish defendants' liability when many\nclass members with learning disabilities received no special educational services. Defendants' limited provision of\neducational services to class members violates the applicable state laws under any reasonable interpretation of\nthose laws. Thus, no intricate question of state law interpretation warrants abstention in this case.\nFAILURE TO EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES\nDefendants seek to have plaintiffs' claims dismissed for failure to exhaust all available administrative remedies.\nThis is not the first occasion a defendant in this case has proffered this tenuous argument. The weakness of this\nargument was clearly explained in the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV\ndated December 10, 1996 as adopted by order of Judge Kimba M. Wood dated May 27, 1997. This court is\n248 equally unpersuaded *248 by City defendants' exhaustion argument. The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995\n(\"PLRA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996) does not require prospective plaintiffs to avail themselves\nof the grievance procedure for issues outside the jurisdiction of DOC. Resolution of plaintiffs' claims for\neducational services falls beyond the powers of DOC and thus the claims are not barred by the PLRA's\nexhaustion requirement. Because the nature of relief sought by plaintiffs makes the exhaustion requirement\ninapplicable in this case, the court need not address the broader issue of whether the PLRA's exhaustion\nrequirement applies to bona fide class actions in general.\n\nPLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\nThe plaintiff class is comprised of persons between the age of 16 and 21 years who have not earned a high\nschool degree and are held in the custody of DOC. New York law creates an entitlement to education for all\nyoungsters between the ages of 5 and 21 years. N.Y. Educ. L. § 3202. The manner in which a society treats its\nprisoners offers unparalleled insight into its degree of civilization. See F. Dostoyevsky, The House of the Dead\n(1861). Thus, in an enlightened state like New York, the fact that a youngster becomes incarcerated does not\nimply that he or she has forfeited the entitlement to education. N.Y. Educ. L. § 3202(7); 9 NYCCR §\n7070.1-7070.2 (defining incarcerated youngsters eligible for educational services when they are incarcerated or\nlikely to be incarcerated for ten or more days). It is well settled from high authority that when state law guarantees\na free public education this creates a constitutionally protected property interest. See Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S.\n565, 574-76, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975). Defendants clearly may not abrogate plaintiffs' constitutionally\nprotected property interests without any procedural safeguards without running afoul of the due process clause.\nThe plaintiff class contains two groups of inmates: the younger inmates for whom full time educational instruction\nis mandatory and the older inmates who are entitled, but not required, to receive at least part-time schooling. N.Y.\nEduc. L. § 3205 (requiring full time instruction for 6 to 17 year old students and offering part-time instruction to\nprospective students between the ages of 18 and 21 years who have not yet earned a high school diploma).\nExtensive regulations govern the quality and quantity of such instruction in far greater detail than the court need\nconsider here. Plaintiffs have produced uncontradicted evidence that many class members received no\neducational services for significant lengths of time. As particularly egregious examples, plaintiffs have put forward\nunrefuted evidence that hundreds of adolescent inmates held in special housing areas (such as homosexual\nhousing, protective custody, mental observation, administrative segregation and punitive segregation) received\nabsolutely no schooling during many semesters. Dispute as to the exact number of these inmates proves\nimmaterial as there can be no genuine dispute that the total failure to provide any general education services to\nany eligible inmates is not a violation of those inmates' rights.\nAs mentioned above, plaintiffs have also proffered uncontradicted evidence that a substantial number of class\nmembers suffer from learning disabilities rendering their educational entitlements subject to the IDEA as well as\nNew York laws governing special education. Just like the general entitlement to a free public education, the\nentitlement to special education services is not trumped by incarceration. The IDEA requires school districts to\nproactively attempt to identify all youngsters with disabilities and, for each child, develop an individualized\neducation plan (\"IEP\") tailored to meet that child's unique learning needs. 20 U.S.C. § 1414. The relevant statutes\n249 and regulations provide great detail as to the minimal requirements *249 of creating and implementing these\nIEPs. Plaintiffs have presented unrefuted evidence as to the limited efforts defendants have undertaken to\nidentify class members in need of special education, the paltry number of IEPs developed at Rikers Island, the\nfrequent failure to obtain existing IEPs created for class members prior to their incarceration, the lack of special\nclassroom facilities and resource rooms, and the systematic failure to tailor class members' educational programs\nto meet their special educational needs. There can be no genuine dispute that the total failure to provide any\nspecial education services to eligible inmates is not a violation of those inmates' rights.\nNew York law grants class members a property right to a free and appropriate education. Under any reasonable\ninterpretation of the relevant laws, defendants have prevented class members from enjoying this property right\nwithout any procedural protections prior to this deprivation. For these reasons the court granted a motion for\ndeclaratory judgment establishing City defendants' liability for failure to provide class members with adequate\neducational services. The court also ordered City defendants to file a plan for providing full and complete\neducational services for all eligible inmates of Rikers Island. This remedy serves to prevent future such violations\nof class members' rights.\nThis court cannot overstate the importance of education for youngsters in general but especially for youth whose\nencounters with the legal system have gained them membership in the plaintiff class. Depriving class members of\nadequate educational services for the duration of their incarceration not only deprives those individuals of their\nrights but also poorly serves the larger society to which class members will return, and hopefully remain, upon\n\ntheir release. The court has ordered defendants to devise a plan to ensure that the City defendants provide\nadequate educational services to inmates on Rikers Island in years to come. The better the educational services\nprovided the greater the chance that the seeds of learning may bloom in prison air so that someday only\nignorance will waste and wither there. See O. Wilde, \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\" (1898).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons outlined above the court granted plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment, establishing the City\ndefendants' liability for failure to provide adequate general and special educational services to class members at\nthe facilities on Rikers Island.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Nussle, 534 U.S. \n Footnotes \n \n1  The court does not reach plaintiffs’ estoppel argument. \n \n \n2  In Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001), Justice Souter noted that “[w]ithout the possibility of \nsome relief, the administrative officers would presumably have no authority to act on the subject of the complaint, leaving the \n \ninmate with nothing to exhaust.” 532 U.S., at 736, n. 4. The court provides a robust analysis of this issue, infra. \n \n3  In Booth, the Court did conclude that amendments to § 1997e(a) “eliminated both the discretion to dispense with administrative \nexhaustion and the condition that the remedy be ‘plain, speedy, and effective’ before exhaustion could be required.” Id. at 739. \n \nNeither Porter nor Booth clearly foreclosed all possibilities that even mandatory exhaustion may be excused by a district court. See \nLyon v. Vande Krol, 305 F.3d 806, 812 (8th Cir.2002) (Bright, J., dissenting). \n \n4  As the court’s analysis shall show, the Court’s decision in Porter itself does not require the plaintiffs in the case to exhaust prior to \nbringing this action in federal district court. According to a literal reading of the Second Circuit’s order remanding the case, this \n \ncourt’s analysis could have ended there. To the extent that the Court’s decision in Porter made reference to Booth, the court opted \nto go a step further and address the issue of whether Porter or Booth affected an analysis of whether “remedies” were “available” \nunder § 1997e(a). \n \n5  To the extent that this argument was not previously made, it would be deemed to be waived. \n \n \n6  As the court shall explain, this argument is not based on a futility exception. \n \n \n7  Though the court takes no position on the issue, Porter would appear to defeat the City’s argument. In Porter, the Court noted that \nCongress wished to afford corrections officials the opportunity to address complaints internally. Id. at 525. This observation is \n \ninconsistent with a rule requiring exhaustion of a remedy which is outside of the prison and which does not involve prison \nauthorities. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  9 \n ",

Kramer, Office of Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General of the State of New York, New York City, for State\ndefendant.\nOPINION\nMOTLEY, District Judge.\nOPINION ON THE PARTIES' CROSS-APPLICATIONS TO AMEND THE\nEDUCATION PLAN\nI. Introduction\nReformation, like education, is a journey, not a destination.\n[1]\nMary Belle Harris, I Knew Them in Prison (1936)\nAlmost exactly six years ago, plaintiffs brought this class action suit against defendants the City of New York, the\nBoard of Education of the City of New York (\"BOE\"), the New York City Department of Correction (\"DOC\"), and\nvarious city officials (collectively the \"City defendants\"). Also named as a defendant was the Commissioner of the\nNew York State Education Department. The plaintiff class consists of inmates incarcerated at DOC facilities on\nRikers Island who are sixteen to twenty-one years of age and have yet to receive a high school diploma or its\nequivalent. Plaintiffs allege that defendants have failed to provide them with educational services to which they\nare entitled under federal and state law.\nIn January 2000 this court granted plaintiffs' motion for declaratory and partial summary judgment against the City\ndefendants, finding that the City defendants had violated the constitutional and statutory rights of plaintiffs. The\ncourt ordered the City defendants to submit for the court's approval a remedial plan \"for providing full and\ncomplete educational facilities and services to all eligible Rikers Island inmates.\" Order, Jan. 7, 2000, ¶ 12. In\nApril 2000 the City defendants submitted their \"Education Plan for the Rikers Island Academies\" (\"Education\nPlan\" or \"Plan\"). The court only reluctantly approved the Plan, noting that the Plan would \"not meet all the needs\nof incarcerated youth inmates\" and that it was \"deficient in many respects.\" Order, June 29, 2000, ¶ 2. The court\ntherefore simultaneously appointed a monitor to observe the Education Plan in action for a period of one year. \nSee id. ¶¶ 3-4. After the one-year period of observation, the monitor was to file a report with the court and make\nrecommendations for improvements to the Plan. See id.\n\nThe court-appointed monitor, Dr. Sheri Meisel (the \"monitor\"), filed her Final Report with the court in December\n2001, and in response the parties submitted proposed modifications to the Education Plan. The Final Report and\nthe parties' submissions make clear that the City defendants continue to fail to meet their obligations under state\nand federal law. Indeed, the City defendants appear to concede that modification to the Education Plan is\nnecessary; they have submitted a four-page \"Corrective Action Plan\" for the court's approval which, they assert,\nwill address any remaining shortcomings.\nPlaintiffs object to the City defendants' Corrective Action Plan as woefully inadequate. Plaintiffs argue that\n531 defendants *531 have had their opportunity to remedy the situation and have failed. Plaintiffs therefore argue for\nsubstantial court intervention and supervision over the provision of educational services to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs\nhave submitted a highly detailed, thirty-seven page Proposed Order which, to be blunt, approaches a policies and\nprocedures manual in its depth and detail. Plaintiffs claim that such intrusiveness is necessary to ensure that the\nclassmembers' rights are vindicated.\nOn April 12, 2002, the court heard the parties on their proposed modifications to the Education Plan, and the\ncourt permitted defendants to file post-argument replies. For the reasons stated in this opinion, the court will\norder several modifications to the original Education Plan. The court, however, is not inclined to engage in the\nsort of micromanaging that plaintiffs have proposed.\nFinally, the court would be remiss if it failed to note that significant improvements have been made at Rikers\nIsland over the past six years with regard to the educational services provided to classmembers. See Final Rep.\nat 8-9; Lisante Decl. ¶ 5; Conry Decl. ¶ 6. The court is pleased with the progress that has been made, and the\ncourt is confident that the City defendants 00 with a sensible degree of judicial nudging 00 can come into full\n97 97\ncompliance with the law. The Education Plan will be modified accordingly.\nII. The Declaratory Judgment\nAs an initial matter, the court would like to correct a misapprehension that the City defendants have. The City\ndefendants insist that this court's entry of a declaratory judgment against them was only \"based on plaintiffs'\nprocedural due process claim[s],\" and that the court \"made no rulings on plaintiffs' IDEA, Rehabilitation Act,\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and state law claims.\" City Defs.' Resp. at 2. The City defendants are mistaken.\nFirst, the court reminds the City defendants that the court granted plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment at the\nclose of oral argument, reading out a handwritten order which stated \"the motion for a declaratory judgment by\nplaintiff[s] in [their] favor is granted.\" Order, Jan. 7, 2000, ¶ 12. There were no restrictions placed on that grant. As\nplaintiffs' moving papers make clear, their motion for declaratory judgment was premised on the New York\nConstitution, New York Education Law, New York State Education and Executive Department regulations, the\nIndividuals with Disabilities in Education Act (\"IDEA\") and implementing regulations, the Rehabilitation Act and\nimplementing regulations, the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and implementing regulations, 42 U.S.C. §\n1983, and the United States Constitution. See Mem.Supp. Pls.' Mot. Declaratory J. & Partial Summ.J. Against\nCity Defs. at 5-25.\nSecond, the court's subsequent opinion served primarily to reject the City defendants' purported \"defenses\"\n(mootness, abstention, and failure to exhaust administrative remedies) and to explain the rationale for the court's\ndenial of the City defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment 00 a motion upon which the court had yet to\n97\nrule. See Handberry v. Thompson, 92 F.Supp.2d 244, 247-48 (S.D.N.Y.2000). Since the court had already\ngranted plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment from the bench, the court, in the interest of efficiency, kept the\nremainder of the opinion rather brief 00 the entire opinion consumes only five pages of the Federal Supplement\n97\n2d. The court did not survey the volumes of evidence presented that supported plaintiffs' claims, nor did the court\n532 survey all the relevant law upon which it *532 relied when it had granted the motion two months earlier.\nThe court also reminds the City defendants that the court found that their original Education Plan did not \"meet all\nof the needs of incarcerated youth inmates on Rikers Island and [was] deficient in many respects as disclosed by\n\nplaintiffs' proposed plan.\" Order, June 29, 2000, ¶ 2. If the court had, in fact, relied only upon plaintiffs' due\nprocess claims in evaluating the Plan, the court would not have found the Education Plan to be so inadequate.\nFinally, to think that the court would only rule on plaintiffs' constitutional claims and no others strains credulity.\nThe court would not have simply held the remaining claims in abeyance for two years without ruling on them, nor\ndoes the court believe that plaintiffs' zealous counsel would have sat by idly if everyone did not know that the\ncourt had, in fact, ruled on plaintiffs' statutory and regulatory claims as well as their constitutional ones. The City\ndefendants' contention that their liability was premised only on plaintiffs' procedural due process claims is\ntherefore without merit.\nIII. The Final Report of the Monitor\nThe court-appointed monitor, Dr. Sheri Meisel, issued her Final Report on December 5, 2001. In her Report, she\ndetails her observations regarding the provision of educational services at Rikers Island. The monitor based her\nfindings upon numerous site visits over the course of the year, interviews with inmates, consultations with BOE\nand DOC employees and administrators, and an examination of BOE and DOC documents as well as\nsubmissions of the parties. Dr. Meisel, a non-lawyer, also makes some legal conclusions and recommendations\nconcerning modification of the Educational Plan.\nIn their papers filed in response to the Final Report, plaintiffs have urged the court to simply adopt the Final\nReport's factual findings as findings of the court. See Pls.' Resp. at 5-6. At oral argument, however, plaintiffs\nretreated from that position: \"We just wanted to make clear that our suggestion was simply, with respect, that the\ncourt adopt the uncontroverted findings ... [W]e were only asking that the court adopt those findings that are not\nin dispute.\" Oral Arg.Tr. 04/12/02 at 71.\nThe City defendants, in response to the Final Report, have submitted declarations from Steven Conry (DOC\nBureau Chief of Management and Planning), Marjorie Weiner (a DOC research scientist), and Timothy Lisante\n(BOE Deputy Superintendent for Alternative, Adult and Continuing Education, Schools and Programs). These\ndeclarations contradict or clarify several findings of the monitor.\nThe court declines plaintiffs' initial invitation to a wholesale adoption of the Final Report. Rather, the court will\nadopt only specific factual findings contained in the Report, and only those findings which have been\nuncontroverted by the City defendants' submissions. The court will disregard the monitor's legal conclusions.\nFinally, while the court greatly appreciates the monitor's recommendations for improvement, for reasons\nexplained below, it cannot adopt many of them.\nThe court will not separately summarize or survey the facts contained in the Final Report or those contained in\nthe City defendants' declarations submitted in opposition. This opinion will assume the reader's familiarity with\nthose documents as well as the history of this case. Each issue addressed below will reference relevant portions\nof the record. Any factual findings of the court will be limited at this time to those that are made herein.\nIV. The Nature of Relief\n533 The Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626, circumscribes a court's *533 authority to order prospective or\ninjunctive relief in a prison setting. Any such relief must be \"narrowly drawn\" and \"extend no further than\nnecessary\" to secure an inmate's rights and must be \"the least intrusive means necessary\" to correct a violation\nof those rights. Id. § 3626(a). The court must also give \"substantial weight\" to any adverse impact on public\nsafety or on the operation of the criminal justice system. Id.\nIn the sections that follow, the court will survey the areas of alleged noncompliance with federal and state law.\nWhere the court finds violations of federal or state law, the court will order compliance. Much of the relief\nrequested by plaintiffs falls beyond the scope of \"least intrusive\" and \"narrowly drawn.\" That, however, does not\ndiminish the fact that the City defendants, by their own admission or by failing to dispute the findings of the\nmonitor, remain non-compliant with applicable state and federal law after years of litigation. The court is therefore\ncompelled to order compliance. The order filed herewith, the court believes, is crafted in a way that is narrowly\n\ndrawn and extends no further than necessary to achieve compliance while keeping in mind public safety and the\noperation of the criminal justice system.\nV. Basic Issues Concerning Access to Educational Services\nA. Definition of Entitled Inmate\nThe parties dispute the time-frame in which an eligible inmate becomes entitled to receive educational services.\nCiting one set of regulations, plaintiffs argue that an inmate becomes eligible after ten days of incarceration. See\nN.Y.Comp.Codes R. & Regs. tit. 9, § 7070.1 (stating that all \"eligible inmates are entitled to receive educational\nservices\"); id. § 7070.2 (defining \"eligible inmate\" as one \"incarcerated in a local correctional facility for 10 or\nmore calendar days\" or who is \"expected to be incarcerated for a period of 10 or more calendar days\").\nThe City defendants, pointing to another set of regulations, argue that they have an additional ten school days\nbefore an inmate becomes entitled to receive services. See N.Y.Comp.Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8, § 118.4\n(\"Instruction shall commence not later than the 11th school day following the school district's receipt of a request\nfor educational services.\").\nNo evidence has been submitted, however, that the City defendants have failed to provide services within ten\ndays of incarceration. See Final Rep. at 10-11. The court will therefore not address the issue at this time. Should\nthe City defendants cease to provide services within ten days of incarceration, plaintiffs can renew their request\nfor a determination of the definition of \"entitled inmate\" under New York law.\nB. Notice and Requests for Services\nIn her Final Report the monitor expresses her dissatisfaction with the notification procedures the City defendants\nhave utilized to inform eligible youth of their right to receive educational services. See Final Rep. at 12-16. The\nmonitor notes three ways in which the City defendants attempt to apprize eligible inmates of their entitlement to\neducational services: (1) A videotaped presentation that covers a wide range of jail regulations and services is\nshown during facility orientation sessions, including a brief segment on the availability of educational services; (2)\ncorrectional officers read or paraphrase a few sentences from the Request for Educational Services form\nconcerning eligibility prior to distributing them; and (3) a notice is posted in housing units, the law library, school\n534 hallways, and in program carts. See id. at 12. The monitor was *534 made aware of a version of the form\navailable in Spanish, but she never observed it actually being made available to inmates during orientation. Id. In\none instance, the monitor observed that detainees were required to complete the form prior to the video and prior\nto the oral presentation. Id. In every instance observed by the monitor, the staff member's oral presentation failed\nto \"cover[ ] all of the information printed in Part IV of the Request.\" Education Plan ¶ 10. The monitor ultimately\nconcludes that the City defendants' practices and procedures \"do not constitute sufficient notification and do not\nadequately encourage participation in educational services.\" Final Rep. at 12.\nThe monitor makes many thoughtful recommendations which, in her professional opinion, would increase levels\nof participation by incoming detainees. Plaintiffs urge the court to adopt the monitor's recommendations and\ncompel the City defendants to implement the monitor's proposed notification scheme. Plaintiffs cite relevant state\nregulations in support of their request. See N.Y.Comp.Codes R. & Regs. tit. 9, § 7070.1 (\"Eligible youth ... shall\nbe encouraged to become involved in an educational program.\"); id. § 7070.4(d) (\"Facility staff shall make\nreasonable efforts to assist all eligible youth, including those who may be non-English speaking, to understand\nthe information provided concerning the educational services program.\").\nThe City defendants respond by arguing that they have complied with the minimum requirements of the\napplicable state regulations. See N.Y.Comp.Codes R. & Regs. tit. 9, § 7070.4(b). The City defendants also state\nthat they are in the process of modifying the admission orientation to include the presentation of a video\nproduced by BOE, in English and Spanish, about its educational services.\n\nThe court cannot say that the City defendants' procedures for notification (i.e., the proposed BOE video\npresentation coupled with the requirements of paragraph 10 of the Education Plan) fail to \"encourage\" eligible\nyouth or that they are \"unreasonable.\" While the court has no doubt that plaintiffs' proposed procedures would\nresult in more students participating, maximization of enrollment is not the business of the court 00 compliance\n97\nwith the law is.\nThe court finds, however, that the City defendants have failed to consistently and adequately follow the\nnotification procedures mandated by the Education Plan and applicable regulations, both with regard to the oral\npresentations and in making translations available to non-English speakers. The court will therefore order the City\ndefendants to comply with the terms of the Plan and applicable law.\nC. Escorts and Security\nThe Final Report documents several instances of students arriving to class late or not at all because DOC failed\nto provide escort officers or sufficient security personnel. See Final Rep. at 16-17. This failure to provide escorts\nor sufficient security personnel resulted in many instances of inmates not receiving the total number of\neducational contact hours to which they are entitled by law.\nIn response, the City defendants have only controverted or (more accurately, clarified) two of the factual\nobservations documented in the Final Report. See Conry Decl. ¶ 12. As for the other instances, the City\ndefendants apparently concede that improvement is needed in this area because \"DOC is implementing a 3-point\nremedial plan to ensure among other things that all compulsory education entitled inmates ... are brought to the\n535 school area, including inmates in mental observation and gay housing units.\" City Defs.' *535 Resp. at 12; see\nalso id. at 9 (\"DOC has instituted a 3-part education and self-monitoring program to rectify problems concerning\ntimely arrival to class and to ensure that no compulsory education entitled inmates miss school unless legally\nexcused from class.\"). This three-part program is described in the Conry Declaration. See Conry Decl. ¶¶ 11-13.\nThe three-part program, however, is nowhere detailed in the city's proposed Corrective Action Plan.\nThe court hereby finds that the City defendants have repeatedly failed to provide escorts and sufficient security\npersonnel to ensure that entitled inmates receive the total number of educational contact hours to which they are\nlegally entitled. The court will therefore order the City defendants to assign a sufficient number of correction\nofficers for escort and security in each facility during each school period so that each eligible inmate arrives on\ntime and receives the minimum number of hours of educational services to which the inmate is legally entitled.\nThe court will also direct the City defendants to establish appropriate procedures and training programs to\neffectuate this order.\nD. Minimum Instructional Time for General Educational Services\nThe parties have spilled considerable ink concerning the minimum instructional time required by New York law.\nPlaintiffs argue that the City defendants must provide 5.5 hours of general education services daily (Monday\nthrough Friday) for compulsory-age inmates (i.e., 16 and 17-year-olds) and 3 hours per day for 18 to 21-year-\nolds. City defendants insist that they need provide only 3 hours per day for all eligible inmates.\nSection VII of DOC Directive 3503R indicates that DOC's policy is that every reasonable effort should be made to\nprovide space sufficient for BOE to provide 5.5 hours of instruction per day to compulsory-age inmates and 3\nhours per day to other eligible inmates. The City defendants argue, however, that they are not required to provide\n5.5 hours of instruction per day.\nIn support of their argument, the City defendants point to section 3202 of New York Education Law which\nprovides that\nA person under twenty-one years of age who has not received a high school diploma and who is\nincarcerated in a correctional facility maintained by a county or by the city of New York or in a\n\nyouth shelter is eligible for educational services pursuant to this subdivision and in accordance\nwith the regulations of the commissioner.\nN.Y.Educ.L. § 3202(7)(a). Part 118 of the state education commissioner's implementing regulations, entitled\n\"Instructional Programs for Students Incarcerated in Correctional Facilities Maintained by Counties or the City of\nNew York,\" states that \"[t]he amount of instructional time provided to each student shall total not less than three\nhours per school day.\" N.Y.Comp.Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8, § 118.4(b).\nPlaintiffs, in support of their argument for a minimum of 5.5 hours per day for 16 and 17-year-olds, point to\nsection 3205 of New York Education Law, which provides that \"each minor from six to sixteen years of age shall\nattend upon full time instruction,\" and that \"the board of education shall have power to require minors from\nsixteen to seventeen years of age who are not employed to attend upon full time day instruction until the last day\nof session in the school year in which the student becomes seventeen years of age.\" N.Y.Educ.L. § 3205(1)(a),\n(3); see also Bylaws of the Bd. of Educ. of the City of New York § 4.1 (June 20, 2001) (\"Each minor child residing\n536 in New York City from six to seventeen years of age shall attend full *536 time instruction, except upon\ncompletion of a four year high school course of study.\"). In support of their argument that \"full time\" means a\nminimum of 5.5 hours per day, plaintiffs point to Part 175 of the commissioner's regulations, entitled \"State Aid,\"\nwhich provides that\nThe daily sessions for pupils in grades seven through 12 shall be a minimum of five and one-half\nhours including time spent by students in actual instructional or supervised study activities,\nexclusive of time allowed for lunch, and including hourly units of time spent by all teachers and\nother instructional staff within a grade level or school building attending upon staff development\nactivities relating to implementation of new high learning standards and assessments as\nauthorized by section 3604(8) of the Education Law.\nN.Y.Comp.Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8, § 175.5(a)(3). Plaintiffs concede that eligible inmates aged 18 to 21 years of\nage are only entitled to 3 hours of instruction per day.\nPlaintiffs also seem to argue that the City defendants have somehow waived their right to argue that they are only\nlegally required to provide 3 hours of instruction per day to compulsory-age inmates:\n[The City defendants' argument] is an attempt to whitewash the fact that the City has long insisted\nthat it does provide 5.5 hours of instruction to adolescents, and the monitors' [sic] reports\ndemonstrate that, even this far into remedial litigation, it still has failed to do so. The City should\nnot be permitted to threaten to provide fewer services in response to its failure to meet its own\nstandards.\nPls.' Reply at 7 (original emphasis).\nThe court is not persuaded by plaintiffs' arguments. The statute cited by plaintiffs speaks only in general terms\nwhile the statute cited by the City defendants specifically refers to incarcerated student programs. The regulation\ncited by plaintiffs indicates in its section heading and part heading that it concerns the \"[l]ength of school day ... \nfor State aid purposes,\" and the regulation was implemented pursuant to a different statute than the one upon\nwhich plaintiffs' rely. N.Y.Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8, § 175.5 (emphasis added). Moreover, that same section\n[2]\nof the regulations contemplates a fewer number of hours for alternative education programs. See id. § 175.5(e).\nIn contrast, the regulation cited by the City defendants, in its section heading, part heading, and substance,\nspecifically indicates that it applies to instructional programs for incarcerated persons. See id. § 118.4. Moreover,\nits history indicates that it was enacted pursuant to section 3202 of New York Education Law. See id.\nWhile the court is certainly sympathetic to plaintiffs' desire to maximize instructional time 00 a mere three hours of\n97\ninstruction per day strikes the court as rather anemic in the grand scheme of things 00 the court is of the opinion\n97\nthat New York law requires only three hours per day of instruction. While that amount is small, it is not so small as\nto be de minimis or nonexistent, and thus it is not in and of itself constitutionally infirm. See San Antonio Indep.\nSch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 35 37, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973); Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc.\n\n537 v. State,*537 744 N.Y.S.2d 130 (N.Y.App.Div.2002) (describing minimal educational requirements under state\nconstitution).\nAs for the City defendants' alleged misrepresentations concerning the amount of services they have provided, the\nfact that the City defendants may have said they intended to provided five and one-half hours of instruction per\nday is irrelevant to the determination of what they are legally obligated to provide. Moreover, the City defendants'\nposition has always been that they were only legally required to provide three hours of instruction per day. See\nCity Defs.' Mem.Supp.Mot.Summ.J. & Opp. Pls.' Mot. for Declaratory & Partial Summ.J. (12/20/99) at 13.\nDespite the fact that the City defendants were obligated to provide three hours of instruction five days per week,\nthe Final Report makes clear that the City defendants have failed to live up to that minimal obligation. See Final\nRep. at 18-20. It is that failure to provide the obligatory minimum that has resulted in a continuing constitutional\nviolation. See Handberry v. Thompson, 92 F.Supp.2d at 248-49. The city concedes that it has fallen short,\npromising to do better: \"By next school year, BOE will provide a minimum of 3 hours of daily classroom\ninstruction in all classroom settings for entitled inmates, the legally required minimum in a jail setting.\" City Defs.'\nResp. at 10; see also, e.g., Lisante Decl. ¶ 7(b) (Island Academy GED program for non-compulsory entitled\ninmates only meets 3 hours per day, 4 days per week). The court hereby finds that the City defendants have\ncontinued to fail to provide the minimum amount of instructional time to which plaintiffs are entitled under New\nYork law. While the court appreciates the City defendants' promise to do better, the court will provide them with\nan additional incentive: a court order requiring them to comply with the law.\nE. Scheduling Conflicts\nNew York law provides that a jail's schedule must be organized so that no entitled inmate who opts to participate\nin educational services is denied the opportunity to also participate in (1) exercise, (2) legal services, (3) religious\nservices, (4) visitation, and (5) health services because of a scheduling conflict. N.Y.Comp.Codes R. & Regs. tit.\n9, § 7070.6(c). The monitor notes in the Final Report that inmates were sometimes forced to choose between\ncommissary and educational services. See Final Rep. at 18. Commissary, however, is not included in the list of\nservices that must be made available to students participating in educational services. The court will not,\ntherefore, follow plaintiffs' (and the monitor's) suggestion that it order the City defendants to make commissary\nservices equally available.\nIn any event, according to the City defendants, DOC now provides commissary services to entitled inmates by\nfilling their commissary orders before all other orders or by scheduling make-up commissary. See Conry Decl. ¶\n14.\nF. Compulsory-Age Inmates and G.E.D. Checks\nThe Final Report identifies several instances of compulsory-age inmates, i.e., 16 and 17-year-olds, getting out of\neducational services by claiming to have already obtained a G.E.D. See Final Rep. at 19-20. The New York State\nEducation Department has certain eligibility requirements which must be met before a 16 or 17-year-old can sit\nfor the G.E.D. See N.Y. State Educ.Dept., Office of Workforce Prep. & Continuing Educ., G.E.D. Eligibility\nRequirements, available at . In her Final Report, the monitor concludes that it is unlikely that every compulsory-\n538 age inmate *538 claiming to already have a G.E.D. does, in fact, possess one.\nThe City defendants also seem to doubt that every compulsory-age inmate claiming to possess a G.E.D. already\nhas one. They have therefore proposed a \"3-point remedial plan\" which will \"ensure among other things that all\ncompulsory education entitled inmates at ARDC are brought to the school area .... at which point BOE will\nattempt to verify from which program the inmate received his G.E.D.\" City Defs.' Resp. at 12.\nThe court hereby finds that not all compulsory-aged inmates are attending daily mandatory instruction because of\nthe City defendants' willingness to accept an inmate's representations that he or she already possesses a G.E.D.\nThe court will therefore incorporate into the order modifying the Education Plan the City defendants' proposed\nremedial steps for verifying whether a compulsory-age inmate has already obtained his or her G.E.D.\n\nVI. Curriculum and Instruction\nA. Assessment\nThe monitor noted that several inmates were not properly placed into classes because assessment tests for class\nplacement were only made available in English. The City defendants do not dispute this finding, and the court\nhereby so finds.\nThe City defendants have indicated that they intend to begin placement testing in both English and Spanish. See\nCity Defs.' Resp. at 12. The court will therefore incorporate into its order paragraphs 3 and 4 of the proposed\nCorrective Action Plan. Those paragraphs, however, do not provide for testing in Spanish. The court will therefore\nmodify those paragraphs to ensure that testing in Spanish is made available.\nB. Organization of Curriculum\nAccording to the monitor, \"[t]he curriculum in the Rikers Island Academies is not differentiated to accommodate\nstudents' variable lengths of stay, an important limitation in an education program in a detention facility.\" Final\nRep. at 21. The monitor recommends implementing a bifurcated curriculum 00 a short program designed to be\n97\ncompleted in a few days which focuses on life skills coupled with a more traditional high school equivalency\ncurriculum for inmates who are incarcerated for longer periods. Plaintiffs have asked the court to order the City\ndefendants to implement such a curriculum.\nThe City defendants concede that lengths of stay are variable 00 from one day to sometimes over a year. They\n97\ninsist, however, that their current curriculum meets the needs of eligible inmates. They claim that their modular\ncurriculum is organized into discrete units that are not dependent on previously learned material; inmates with\ndifferent lengths of stay are thus accommodated. See Lisante Decl. ¶ 5(b), Ex. B. And in any event, the City\ndefendants argue, the monitor's proposed curriculum is not required by governing law.\nThe court has reviewed the course syllabi annexed to the Lisante Declaration. While the court has some doubts\n[3]\nas to the City defendants' assertion that each module is not dependent upon previous material,  on the limited\nrecord before it, the court cannot say that the current curriculum is so ineffectual as to be legally or\n539 constitutionally insufficient. Plaintiffs *539 have cited no authority in support of their contention that it is.\nWhile the court can certainly see merit in the monitor's recommendations regarding the bifurcated curriculum,\nsuch a curriculum is not required by law. See N.Y.Comp.Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8, § 118.4. The court will therefore\nnot order the City defendants to implement such a curriculum.\nC. Instructional Strategies and Materials\nThe monitor documents in her Final Report several instances of students \"sleeping, socializing, or otherwise not\nengaged in instructional activities.\" Final Rep. at 22. Her evaluation of the teaching strategies and methods\nemployed by some teachers is also less than stellar. Id. at 22-23. She concludes that a \"major factor\" contributing\nto the teaching staff's ineffectiveness is the fact that the majority of teachers at Rikers Island are only\n\"provisionally certified\" by the state 00 i.e., unable to meet the minimum requirements for full teaching certification\n97\n00 while the majority of teachers at other New York City schools are fully certified. Id. at 23.\n97\nThe City defendants do not dispute the monitor's observations. Rather, they simply argue that the quality of\neducation alone does not implicate plaintiffs' due process right to the education process. See Rodriguez, 411\nU.S. at 35-37, 93 S.Ct. 1278. The City defendants also do not dispute the monitor's conclusion that lack of\ncertified teachers is a problem. Rather, they report that all provisionally certified teachers must become fully state\ncertified by September 1, 2003, under new state Education Department rules. See Lisante Decl. ¶ 32, Ex. E.\n\nThey also indicate that BOE has committed to two full-day, islandwide, staff development sessions, one focusing\non new teachers and a second focusing on educational issues relating to this litigation. See id. ¶ 33, Ex. F.\nThe court questions whether it is competent (at least on this limited record) to opine on the appropriateness of\nany particular teaching strategy. However, the City defendants have not disputed the monitor's finding that 55%\nof the Rikers Island teachers are only provisionally certified while the rest of the system has a provisional\ncertification rate of only 15%. The court so finds. The court also finds that this gross disparity has resulted in\nplaintiffs not receiving educational services to which they are entitled. The court will therefore order the City\ndefendants to achieve parity with the rest of the city schools with respect to teacher certification by September 1,\n2003.\nD. Library Services\nBOE does not employ librarians in the Rikers Island Academies. In addition, according to the monitor, BOE does\nnot maintain an adequate library. See Final Rep. at 24. Plaintiffs, citing state regulations, argue that the City\ndefendants must employ a librarian and provide a sizable library for the use of students. See N.Y.Comp.Codes R.\n& Regs. tit. 8, § 91.1 (\"A school library shall be established and maintained in each school.\"); id. § 91.2 (\"Each\nschool district shall employ a certified school library media specialist....\").\nThe City defendants respond by citing Part 118 of the state education regulations (dealing with the provision of\ninstructional programs in correctional facilities) as well as the regulations' enabling statute, section 3202(7) of\nNew York Education Law. None of these sources indicates that a school in a correctional facility must provide a\nlibrary for its students. Moreover, argue the City defendants, the regulation dictating the minimum space that\nDOC must make available to BOE makes no mention of requiring space for a library. See N.Y.Comp.Codes R. &\n540 Regs. tit. 9, *540 § 7070.3(c)(1) (DOC must \"allocat[e] and maint[ain] classroom space within the facility which\npromotes safe and effective learning environments and accommodates the needs of education personnel and\neligible youth.\"), (c)(6) (DOC must provide \"a secure area within the facility for the storage of instructional\nmaterials, equipment and records, if education personnel or facility staff determine such an area is necessary.\").\nWhile the court agrees with the City defendants that the regulations and statute they cite are silent on the issue of\nlibrary services, the language of the regulations cited by plaintiffs is unequivocal: \"A school library shall be\nestablished and maintained in each school.\" N.Y.Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8, § 91.1. The City defendants\nconsistently refer to the four schools on Rikers Island as \"schools,\" \"high schools,\" \"high school programs,\" and\nthe like. See Lisante Decl. The court can only conclude that the plain language of the regulations cited by\nplaintiffs require the City defendants to provide library services to eligible inmates.\nSection 7070.3 of title 9 of the state regulations is not to the contrary. Provision of space for a library could easily\nfall within the regulatory requirement that DOC provide a \"secure area with the facility for the storage of\ninstructional materials.\" The court will therefore order the City defendants to comply with the requirements of\nstate education regulations regarding the provision of library services.\nVII. Special Education\nA. Child Find, Screening, and Evaluation\nThe IDEA's \"child find\" provision places on school districts an affirmative obligation to identify, locate, and\nevaluate all disabled youth. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A); 34 C.F.R. § 300.125; id. § 300.300(a)(2).\nIncorporated into the original Education Plan was a paragraph which listed five different mechanisms for\nidentifying inmates eligible to receive special education and/or related services: (1) the Child Assistance Program\n(CAP) computer database, (2) self-identification by the inmate, (3) BOE research into educational records not\ncovered by CAP, (4) referrals by BOE personnel, and (5) outside sources such as state courts.\nAccording to the monitor, this screening system \"can reliably identify many special education students,\" but the\nCity defendants have failed to consistently rely on these mechanisms. Final Rep. at 26. For example, CAP\n\nscreening was not performed at Rosewood High School from mid-December 2000 to March 8, 2001, when the\nclerical staff member who normally reviewed the database was absent and BOE did not designate a\nreplacement. Id. The City defendants have not disputed these observations and the court so finds.\nNevertheless, the City defendants claim that their screening methods are highly successful. For example, at the\nHorizons Academy, the City defendants claim to have a 97% success rate in identifying students who receive,\nhave received, or are/were being evaluated to receive special education services. See Lisante Decl. ¶ 16. The\ncourt, however, questions the relevance of this statistic for it says nothing about inmates who need special\neducation services and have nevertheless remained unidentified.\nIn any event, the monitor's observations indicate that the City defendants have failed to live up to the bare terms\nof the original Education Plan. The court's order modifying the Plan will therefore reiterate the requirements of the\nPlan and will require the City defendants to utilize all of the resources previously identified by the City defendants\n541 in the Plan. Plaintiffs urge the court to require BOE to check records on CAP within two days of enrollment. *541\nThe court feels that two days is overly constraining and would not permit reasonable delays caused by\nforeseeable yet unexpected events such as system breakdowns or employee illness. The court will therefore give\nBOE five days to perform CAP checks.\nB. IEP/TEP Issues\nThe IDEA and its implementing regulations contain very specific requirements regarding the development of an\nIndividualized Education Plan (\"IEP\") for each disabled student. See 20 U.S.C. § 1401(11); id. § 1414(d). Under\nthe IDEA, a disabled student is entitled to a free appropriate public education that conforms to his or her IEP. Id. §\n1401(8)(D). \"[T]he IEP sets out the child's present educational performance, establishes annual and short-term\nobjectives for improvements in that performance, and describes the specially designed instruction and services\nthat will enable the child to meet those objectives.\" Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d\n686 (1988). The IEP represents the \"centerpiece of the [IDEA's] education delivery system for disabled children.\" \nId.\nDelivering educational services to disabled students in incarceration, however, presents unique challenges\nbeyond the ken of a traditional IEP. For example, many students are in custody at Rikers Island for only a few\nweeks at a time, while an IEP typically focuses on ways of meeting long term goals and objectives in a more\nstable, long(er) term educational setting. As a result, an \"interim\" or \"temporary\" education plan (\"TEP\") is often\ndeveloped and implemented for students in the Rikers Island schools. While a TEP is functionally similar to an\nIEP, it is not a replacement. It is designed as a temporary fix until a more functional and appropriate IEP can be\ndeveloped for the student and implemented.\nThe monitor has identified six issues with regard to IEPs and TEPs, and the court will address them seriatim.\n1. Retrieving Prior IEPs. The Education Plan makes clear that a TEP should be developed and utilized in\nconjunction with any prior, existing IEP. See Education Plan ¶ 10. The monitor has noted, however, that the\nRikers Island Academies \"do not consistently request or receive IEPs from previous schools.\" Final Rep. at 30.\nThe monitor cites several examples in support of this conclusion. The City defendants do not dispute the\nsubstance of the monitor's findings; rather, they indicate that their previously \"problematic\" rate of retrieval has\n\"greatly improved to the current retrieval rate of 74%.\" Lisante Decl. ¶ 19, Ex. D. While some improvement is\ncertainly a good thing, the court finds that the current rate, even if true, is still unacceptably low. The delays\ncaused by the BOEs failure to obtain prior IEPs deprive a sizable percentage of students of services to which\nthey are legally entitled. The court will therefore order the City defendants to develop and implement procedures\nto increase the IEP retrieval rate.\n2. Failure to Develop and Implement TEPs. The monitor documents numerous instances of the schools on Rikers\nIsland failing to develop and implement TEPs for special education students. See Final Rep. at 28-29. The City\ndefendants dispute one of the monitor's observations (regarding TEPs at the Sprungs program) but do not\notherwise dispute her findings. See City Defs.' Resp. at 16-17. The court therefore adopts the monitor's findings\nregarding the development and implementation (or lack thereof) of TEPs. As a result of this failure to consistently\n\ndevelop and implement TEPs, eligible students are deprived of special education services to which they are\n542 legally entitled. *542 The court will therefore order the City defendants to timely develop and implement TEPs for\nall eligible students.\n3. Goals and Objectives. The monitor notes that the TEPs developed in the Rikers Island schools do not include\nshort-term objectives in disability areas affecting educational performance. Specifically, the monitor reviewed\nseventy-five TEPs developed between October 2000 and June 2001, including TEPs developed for students who\nwere demonstrating behavioral problems in each of the four Rikers schools, and found that none included goals\nand objectives to address behavioral or social skills. Final Rep. at 31. The City defendants concede that they\nhave fallen short in this area and the court so finds. See City Defs.' Resp. at 17-18; City Defs.' Reply at 8. They\nhave indicated that they are in the process of developing specifically targeted training for education evaluators,\npsychologists, and social workers so that future TEPs will provide \"more individually tailored and measurable\neducational and behavioral goals appropriate for the student, taking into consideration both his or her educational\nand social history and incarcerated status.\" Id.\nWhile the court appreciates the representations made by the City defendants, the court notes that the City\ndefendants have failed to live up to all of the representations made in their original Education Plan. The court will\ntherefore order the City defendants to include appropriate goals and objectives in TEPs.\n4. IEP/TEP Team Participants. The monitor notes, and the City defendants recognize, that parents and general\neducation teachers often do not participate in IEP/TEP Teams. See Final Rep. at 31; City Defs.' Resp. at 18; City\nDefs.' Reply at 8. BOE \"believes\" that much of the purported non-participation by these persons is due to what\namounts to a scrivener's error. Id. The statute and implementing regulations make very clear, though, whose\nparticipation is required on an IEP/TEP Team. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B). The court will therefore order the\nCity defendants to comply with the terms of the statute. The court will also require the City defendants to better\ndocument individuals' participation in IEP/TEP Teams.\n5. Annual Review and Triennial Evaluation. The monitor notes, the City defendants do not dispute, and the court\nhereby finds that BOE does not conduct annual reviews or triennial evaluations when those dates fall due while a\nstudent with an IEP is in custody. See Final Rep. at 32. Simply because a student may be incarcerated for less\nthan a year does not exempt BOE from the requirements of conducting reviews and evaluations. See 20 U.S.C. §\n1414(a)(2), (d)(3). The court will therefore order the City defendants to comply with the review and evaluation\nrequirements of 20 U.S.C. § 1414. As for TEPs, the City defendants have suggested a retesting and review of an\ninmate's TEP sixty to eighty days after implementation. The court will incorporate the City defendants' suggestion\ninto its order.\n6. Extended Year Services. The monitor notes that \"the TEP process does not include consideration of students'\nneeds for extended school year services and the Rikers Island Academies do not provide those services.\" Final\nRep. at 33. The City defendants do not contest the finding. They merely respond by stating that \"BOE is\nendeavoring to meet its extended school year needs through itinerant teachers and related services providers.\"\nCity Defs.' Reply at 8. The regulations, however, require the provision of extended year services when\nappropriate. 34 C.F.R. § 300.309. \"Endeavoring\" alone, while appreciated, is insufficient. The court will therefore\norder the provision of extended year services.\n543  C. Continuum of Services\n*543\nThe monitor notes several problems with the range of special education services provided on Rikers Island. Skills\nsupport classes, while mandated by the Education Plan, have not been consistently delivered. Moreover, classes\nare often too large and unwieldy, teachers are often not fully certified in special education, and necessary\nfacilities and classes for students with the severest needs were not provided. See Final Rep. at 33-35.\nThe City defendants do not dispute the substance of the observations. Rather, they respond by proposing to offer\nan amorphous one-size-fits-all \"skills class\" either taught by a special education teacher or by a subject area\nteacher in consultation with a special education teacher. See Corrective Action Plan ¶ 7. Such an offering is less\nthan what the City defendants are required to provide under the terms of the original Education Plan, see\n\nEducation Plan ¶ 18, Ex. C, at 1-2, and falls far short of the sort of individualized services required by the IDEA. \nSee e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 300.5; id. § 300.301; id. § 300.551. The court will therefore order the City defendants to\nprovide disabled students with an appropriate range of services.\nD. Related Services\nDisabled students who require related services such as counseling, speech therapy, and vision services are\nentitled to receive these services under the IDEA. See 34 C.F.R. § 300.24. The monitor claims that the City\ndefendants have not provided counseling services to students who require them. See Final Rep. at 35-36. The\nCity defendants dispute this finding, claiming that in addition to providing counseling services mandated by TEPs,\nthey provide all students with access to counseling. City Defs.' Resp. at 19; Lisante Decl. ¶ 5(n). The monitor also\nclaims that the space provided for counseling is not always adequate, particularly with regard to privacy\nconcerns. See Final Rep. at 36. The City defendants respond that the space, while not ideal, is adequate, and\nthat privacy concerns must be balanced against security concerns. City Defs.' Resp. at 19. The City defendants\nalso state that they will modify existing space to create an additional office or room for counseling during school\nhours at the George R. Vierno Center. Corrective Action Plan ¶ 9.\nAs for speech and language services, the monitor notes that adequate space has not been provided, and that\nmany students have gone without these services despite requiring them. Part of the problem has been one of\nshort staffing. See Final Rep. at 36-37. The City defendants have informed the court that a second bilingual\nspeech and language therapist has been hired for Rikers Island. See Lisante Reply Decl. ¶ 13. BOE insists that\nthis new hire will remedy the shortcomings documented by the monitor. Id.\nAs for hearing and vision services, the monitor documents numerous instances of students not being provided\nwith required hearing or vision services. See Final Rep. at 37-38. While the City defendants have indicated that\nthey are implementing procedures to address this weakness, there is no evidence that contradicts the\nobservations of the monitor. See Lisante Decl. ¶ 28. Moreover, there is no indication that these newly\nimplemented procedures will prove adequate.\nThe undisputed findings of the monitor thus indicate that the City defendants have failed to provide all required\nrelated services, and the court so finds. The court will therefore include in its order appropriate language requiring\nthe City defendants to provide such services. The court will also incorporate the City defendants' representation\n544 that additional counseling *544 space will be made available at the Vierno Center. The court will defer, however,\nto the City defendants with regard to security issues related to counseling.\nE. Transition Services\nUnder the IDEA, an IEP (or TEP) must include \"a statement of the transition service needs\" of the entitled\nstudent. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii); see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.347(b). This statement must \"focus[] on the\nchild's courses of study (such as participation in advanced-placement courses or a vocational education\nprogram).\" 20 U.S.C. § 414(d)(1)(A)(vii). The statement must also include, when appropriate, \"a statement of the\ninteragency responsibilities or any needed linkages.\" Id.\nDuring her tenure, the monitor reviewed numerous TEP documents at Rikers Island and found that the transition\ngoals contained therein \"were very general and similar for all students rather than specific and individualized, and\nthey did not identify any planning or services to be provided by the Rikers Island Academies to prepare students\nto meet the goals.\" Final Rep. at 39. The monitor quotes excerpts from several TEPs in support of her conclusion.\nThe City defendants do not dispute this observation. They simply opine that this failure to individualize and state\nspecific transition goals \"does not deprive any special education entitled inmate of his [sic] property interest in\nspecial education.\" City Defs.' Resp. at 19.\nThe court hereby finds that the City defendants have failed to provide disabled students with adequate\nstatements of transition service needs. Section 1414 and its implementing regulations go into great detail about\nhow IEPs are to be individually tailored to the needs of individual students and mandated services provided\n\naccordingly. The one-size-fits-all approach to transition services currently utilized by the City defendants clearly\nfalls short. The court will therefore order the City defendants to comply with the requirements of the IDEA with\nrespect to the provision of transition services.\nFinally, the monitor reports that some students have had difficulty enrolling in BOE community schools after\nrelease. The City defendants claim that if a community school refuses to enroll a discharged inmate, that inmate\ncan still enroll in programs run by the Alternative Superintendency's office. The court will hold the City defendants\nto that representation.\nVIII. Cell Study\nTwo years ago, when the City defendants submitted their Education Plan, they indicated a commitment to\noperate a cell study program for entitled inmates who cannot attend classes due to security,\nsafety, or medical reasons. DOC is responsible for delivering cell study materials to inmates\nparticipating in the cell study program by the end of school day following DOC's receipt of such\nmaterials from the Board. The Board is responsible for the instructional component. A teacher\nshall continue to be available to interact with entitled inmates receiving cell study, by telephone,\nescorted visit, or other appropriate contact, in accordance with Section IX of DOC Directive\n3503R.\nEducation Plan ¶ 7. Directive 3503R provides that \"[i]nstruction may be provided in person, by telephone, by\nvideo-conferencing, by computer, etc., as deemed appropriate by the teacher and the facility.\" Education Plan Ex.\nB. The court approved the City defendants' Education Plan despite the fact that the court found the plan \"deficient\nin many respects.\" Order, June 29, 2000, ¶ 2.\n545 Now, two years later, the monitor informs the court that the City defendants *545 have failed to live up to the\nrepresentations regarding the provision of cell study that the City defendants made two years ago. She notes that\n(and the City defendants do not dispute that) the only service made available to segregated inmates is generic,\nphotocopied materials combined with occasional, woefully brief telephone instruction sessions, only when the\ntelephones were actually working. When telephone instruction actually took place, the length of instruction\nsessions ranged from five to twenty-five minutes per day. Compulsory-age inmates were often only provided with\nthis pathetic level of educational services when they actually asked for them. Many compulsory-age students\nwere provided with no instruction at all. No special education or related services were provided to inmates in cell\nstudy programs, despite an indication that a disproportionate number of special education students are confined\nin segregated housing areas. Spanish-language cell study was not consistently made available. In sum, the court\nfinds that the City defendants' performance in this area has been particularly abysmal. See Final Rep. at 40-42.\nThe City defendants' response to these findings is to claim that generic, photocopied worksheets combined with\nfive minutes of phone instruction per day is \"legally sufficient.\" City Defs.' Resp. at 21. Even assuming that to be\nthe case (ludicrous as that assumption may be), the City defendants' have failed to provide even that.\nThe City defendants also cite two purported \"incidents\" which allegedly demonstrate the dangers posed by\nanything other than this most restrictive from of instruction. Ignoring the fact that the City defendants have\nsubmitted no declarations or affidavits of persons with personal knowledge of these \"incidents,\" the court is\nshocked that the City defendants would, in effect, punish in perpetuity each and every inmate in segregated\nhousing because of the behavior of a few. The City defendants cannot deprive an individual of educational\nservices to which he or she is entitled because of the actions of another individual. Rather, they can only deny or\nrestrict services if the individual \"presents a clear threat to himself/herself, the safety of other inmates and/or the\nsafety of educational or facility staff.\" N.Y.Comp.Codes R. & Regs. tit. 9, § 7070.7; see also Education Plan ¶ 24.\nThe regulations and the Education Plan spell out in great detail what is required to denominate someone as\nposing as \"clear threat.\" At no time during the monitor's tenure were any eligible inmates found to be a \"clear\nthreat.\" Final Rep. at 12. Nevertheless, as the monitor's observations make clear, inmates in segregated housing\nwere regularly denied services.\n\nGiven this sorry state of affairs, the court has no choice but to order defendants to, at a minimum, live up to the\nrepresentations made previously in the Education Plan. Plaintiffs, in their proposed order, seek to have the court\ndirect the City defendants to go beyond that and provide the broadest possible array of instruction for inmates in\nsegregated housing, up to and including group instruction in a classroom setting in a school area. The court is not\nwilling to go so far. The court is keenly aware of the penalogical interests that must be taken into consideration,\nand students in segregated housing are no doubt being segregated for a reason. Ordering the City defendants to\nprovide group instruction in school areas to segregated students would, in effect, do away with segregation\naltogether. This the court is unwilling to do.\nIX. Other Issues\n546 Plaintiffs urge the court to order the City defendants to implement other recommendations *546 of the monitor,\nincluding her recommendations concerning staffing, budgeting, internal monitoring, and space and school\nmaintenance. The court declines to act on these requests at this time. Most of these areas involve internal DOC\nand BOE management and procedures, and the court does not believe it should engage in this sort of micro-\nmanaging. The court must concern itself only with the City defendants' compliance with the law. Precisely how\nthe City defendants achieve compliance is up to the City defendants themselves.\nAssuming Dr. Meisel is available and willing, the court will reappoint her to serve as monitor for the period\nSeptember 1, 2002, to August 31, 2004. The monitor will assess the City defendants' compliance with the order\nfiled herewith and will provide the court and counsel with semi-annual reports specifically identifying any areas of\nnoncompliance. The reports may also contain recommendations for further modifications to the amended\nEducation Plan. The monitor in her report may also recommend specific changes in BOE and DOC policies and\nprocedures.\nX. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court will order modification of Education Plan as indicated in the order filed\nherewith.\nORDER\nORDER AMENDING THE CITY DEFENDANTS' EDUCATION PLAN\nFor the reasons stated in the Opinion filed herewith on this date, is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and\nDECREED as follows:\nGeneral Provisions\n1. This Order incorporates by reference the provisions of the Education Plan adopted by order of the court on\nJune 29, 2000. If any conflict or ambiguity arises between the Education Plan and this Order, this Order controls.\n2. Unless otherwise provided herein, this Order shall take effect thirty days after entry.\nNotice and Requests for Educational Services\n3. DOC shall comply with the procedures and requirements of paragraph 10 of the Education Plan.\n4. In addition to following the procedures and meeting the requirements of paragraph 10 of the Education Plan,\nBOE shall produce a videotape on the educational services it offers to entitled inmates. The videotape will be\nshown at DOC's new admissions orientation to all newly admitted inmates under 22 years of age who are\n\nincarcerated on Rikers Island. The videotape, the oral presentation required by paragraph 10 of the Education\nPlan, and any printed materials distributed at orientation will be made available in Spanish and English.\n5. For any eligible inmate who does not understand English or Spanish, DOC shall make a good faith, reasonable\neffort to inform the inmate in a language he or she can understand about the inmate's right to educational\nservices as soon as possible after his or her admission to DOC.\nProvision of Educational Services\n6. Unless stated explicitly to the contrary, any and all requirements set forth in this Order shall apply to all of the\nschools, programs and methods of instruction operated by BOE in DOC facilities.\n7. BOE and DOC shall make educational services available to all eligible inmates. Attendance at educational\nservices is compulsory for all eligible inmates who are under 18 years old. Attendance at educational services is\noptional for all other eligible inmates and shall be made available to them upon request.\n547 *547 8. All eligible inmates shall receive a minimum of 3 hours of educational services daily, 5 days per week.\n9. When a 16 or 17-year-old inmate asserts that he or she has either a high school diploma or a general\nequivalency diploma, the inmate shall be brought to the applicable BOE school in his or her jail. If BOE can verify\nthat the inmate has obtained a high school diploma or a general equivalency diploma, the student may decline to\nparticipate in BOE-provided educational services and shall be excused from school while incarcerated.\n10. BOE shall ensure that all teachers teaching at Rikers Island are fully certified by September 1, 2003.\n11. BOE shall provide two full-day staff development sessions, one each semester, for educational staff at the\nRikers Island schools. The Fall session will focus on issues faced by teachers who are new to Rikers Island and/\nor teaching generally. The Spring session will focus on issues specific to Handberry v. Thompson. Issues at these\nseminars may include integrated classroom instruction and management, referral for and implementation when\nneeded of assisted intervention services tailored for an incarcerated population, development and implementation\nof Temporary Education Plans, etc.\n12. BOE and DOC shall provide library materials and services to students in the Rikers Island Academies in\naccordance with sections 91.1 and 91.2 of title 9 of the New York Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations.\nBOE and DOC shall have six months from the date of entry of this order to comply with the terms of this\nparagraph.\nEscorts, School Schedule and Security\n13. DOC shall assign a sufficient number of correction officers for escort and security for each school program in\neach facility during each school period (i.e., classroom, extended day, small group, one-on-one, dayroom, and\ncell study) so that each eligible inmate arrives on time for the school program and receives at least the minimum\nnumber of hours of educational services as set forth in this Order.\n14. DOC shall ensure the orderly and regular movement of eligible inmates to the school area by the\nestablishment of procedures, including passes or personal escorts. Any time allotted or actually spent for the\nmovement of eligible inmates shall not be considered time allotted or spent for the provision of educational\nservices.\n15. DOC shall ensure that the provision of basic jail services does not conflict with the school schedule. Each\nfacility's schedule of activities, programs and services shall be organized so that no eligible inmate who\nparticipates in educational services is denied the opportunity also to participate in the following programs or\nservices because of attendance at educational instruction: 1) recreation, 2) legal services, 3) religious services,\n4) visitation, and 5) health services.\n\n16. Correctional staff shall be trained as to their responsibilities under this Order and the Education Plan. Within\n90 days of the entry of this Order, DOC shall report to counsel the schedule for such training; the areas to be\ncovered in such training so as to ensure that all staff receive training in a timely manner consistent with the\nrequirements of this Order and the Education Plan; which DOC staff members will be provided such training and\nthe frequency with which they will receive it; and the sanctions, if any, that will be imposed on staff if they do not\nattend. Thereafter, at a minimum, DOC will provide training to its staff as set forth on this schedule.\nAssessment and Placement\n548 17. In addition to the provisions of paragraphs 10, 11, and 12 of the Education *548 Plan, on or before the tenth\nschool day following BOEs receipt of a Request for Educational Services as outlined in paragraph 11 of the\nEducation Plan, BOE shall conduct a diagnostic academic placement test for each entitled inmate, and shall\nscreen each entitled inmate in its CAP, ATS and UAPC computer systems (or any replacement system).\n18. BOE shall implement a diagnostic academic placement test such as the diagnostic version of the Test for\nAdult Basic Education for use in assessing and placing entitled inmates. BOE shall provide to its staff members\nwho administer, interpret, and review this test, training on how to administer, interpret and/or review the test\nresults. BOE shall develop guidelines on screening for skills class placement and assisted intervention services,\nas warranted.\nSpecial Education Services\n19. The City defendants shall comply with the requirements of 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A), 34 C.F.R. § 300.125,\nand 34 C.F.R. § 300.300(a)(2), and shall implement screening procedures to locate, identify, and evaluate all\neligible inmates with disabilities.\n20. Within five school days of an inmate's enrollment in a BOE school program, any inmate whose name has not\nbeen previously checked on CAP shall be so checked.\n21. Within two school days of an inmate's identification through CAP as being in need of special education or\nrelated services or in the evaluation process shall be referred to the school based support team or pupil\npersonnel team. The school based support team or pupil personnel team shall meet with the inmate within five\ndays of the referral.\n22. Inmates may also be identified as in possible need of special educational services through self-referral,\nresearch into other educational records, referrals from BOE or DOC personnel, referrals from outside sources\nsuch as the courts and other agencies, and referrals from parents and guardians. The school based support team\nor pupil personnel team shall meet with any inmate for whom identification as a special education student has\nbeen requested by any of these sources. The meeting shall take place within five days of the request. The\npurpose of this meeting shall be to determine if identification and assessment of that inmate as in need of special\neducational services is appropriate. If so, then an initial evaluation for special education shall be performed\npursuant to the procedures set forth in 20 U.S.C. §§ 1414-1415 and their implementing regulations.\n23. Within three school days of any inmate having been identified as previously having received special\neducational services, BOE staff at Rikers Island shall request in writing the Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\")\nof that inmate developed most recently before his or her incarceration. BOE shall make best efforts to obtain the\nIEP of an inmate within ten school days. Within thirty days of the entry of this order, BOE shall develop and\nimplement written procedures for achieving this goal and shall provide copies of these procedures to plaintiffs'\ncounsel. BOE shall also maintain a list of all IEPs not obtained within thirty school days together with the reason\ngiven for the failure to obtain any IEP.\n24. If a student has an existing IEP, BOE shall implement it to the extent it can be implemented in a correctional\nfacility. If necessary and appropriate, a student's IEP may be revised, as defined in 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(4) and\n34 C.F.R. § 300.346. The revised IEP may be referred to as a Temporary Education Plan or TEP.\n549\n\n*549 25. If a student has an existing IEP, service and placement mandates can be modified only once the IEP/\nTEP team has documented the basis for a change in the needs of the student or why a previously identified\nservice is not available at Rikers Island.\n26. If a student has an IEP that is not current, BOE shall make best efforts to provide those services and related\nservices recommended on the prior IEP until a TEP is developed. A TEP must be developed and implemented\nwithin thirty school days of the student's commencing participation in any BOE school or program at the Rikers\nIsland Academies. The TEP shall be created by an IEP/TEP team in accordance with 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B)\nand 34 C.F.R. § 300.344. If for any reason a required member of the IEP/TEP team fails to participate (either in\nperson or telephonically), the reason(s) for his or her nonparticipation shall be documented in the TEP itself.\n27. An IEP/TEP must contain an assessment of the student's level of performance, including how his or her\ndisability affects involvement in the curriculum. It shall also include measurable annual and short term academic\nand social/behavioral objectives as determined to be necessary for each student to improve performance,\nincluding benchmarks or short-term instructional objectives, evaluative criteria, evaluation procedures, and\nschedules to be used to measure progress toward the annual goal. These shall be measurable intermediate\nsteps between the student's present levels of educational performance and the annual goals. The IEP/TEP must\nalso include a statement of the special education and related services that are to be provided to the student;\ndates for the initiation and duration of these services; a transition plan; and consideration of the need for\nextended year services.\n28. If a disabled student has an existing IEP, within sixty calendar days of the student's arrival at Rikers Island,\nBOE shall determine if an annual review or a triennial evaluation pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1414 is due or may\nbecome due during the student's incarceration. If so, BOE shall conduct such a review or evaluation consistent\nwith the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.\n29. Any inmate for whom a TEP has been developed shall be given the diagnostic academic placement test\noutlined in paragraphs 17 and 18 above, not earlier than sixty school days nor later than eighty school days\nfollowing the implementation of the inmate's TEP. The results of this retest shall be reviewed by the appropriate\nmember of the school based support team to determine whether a formal reevaluation of the TEP is warranted.\nThe results of the review of the retest shall be recorded by the reviewer in the inmate's educational folder.\n30. In the event an IEP or TEP for a student at one of the Rikers Island Academies calls for the provision of\nextended school year services, such services shall be provided.\n31. Unless expressly set forth herein, nothing in this order limits eligible inmates' rights under the Individuals with\nDisabilities in Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.\n32. A range of special education services shall be available at each of the Rikers Island schools and programs to\nmeet the needs of disabled students, including but not limited to, general classroom instruction, with\nsupplementary aids and services; skills support classes; resource rooms; and self-contained classes for students\nwith intensive needs. For students who cannot communicate in the English language, BOE shall make best\n550 efforts to *550 provide the services in a language understood by the student.\n33. A range of related services shall be available at each of the Rikers Island Academies schools and programs,\nincluding counseling, speech therapy, and vision and hearing services as needed by each disabled student. For\nstudents who cannot communicate in the English language, BOE shall make best efforts to provide the related\nservices in a language understood by the student.\n34. DOC shall modify existing space to create an additional office or room for counseling during school hours at\nthe George R. Vierno Center.\n35. Class size in classes containing students identified as in need of special educational services shall be\nmaintained at the smallest (most restrictive) class size recommended on the IEP or TEP of any student enrolled\ntherein.\n\n36. Self-contained special educational classes, resource room, and skills support classes must be taught by\nteachers certified to teach special education.\n37. Transition services as defined in 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A) and 34 C.F.R. § 300.347(b) shall be\nrecommended for each disabled student on his or her IEP or TEP. This planning shall include the identification of\nspecific goals and instructional services to prepare students for continued education, employment, and\ncommunity integration including, where appropriate, a statement of inter-agency responsibilities or any needed\nlinkages such as with agencies responsible for housing, vocational, or educational training, and employment\nservices. Such services, including instruction, development of employment objectives, and acquisition of living\nand vocational services as recommended on a student's IEP/TEP shall be provided.\n38. BOE shall ensure that students released from DOC custody have the opportunity to attend BOE\ncomprehensive or alternative high school programs after their release, regardless of the timing of the a student's\nrelease.\nCell Study\n39. An inmate otherwise eligible for educational services may have his or her access to educational services\nrestricted and denied, if necessary, if DOC determines that the provision of educational services to the inmate\nwould present a clear threat to the security of the school, the staff, the inmate, or other inmates.\n40. Eligible inmates shall not be restricted from or denied access to educational services solely on the basis of\ntheir placement in a special housing area, including, but not limited to, punitive or administrative segregation.\n41. Educational services shall be provided to each eligible inmate in special or segregated housing. At a\nminimum, instruction will be provided by telephone, supplemented with appropriate written materials. Other forms\nof acceptable instruction include computer-assisted learning, video-conferencing, and in person instruction (either\nthrough cell openings or in-cell). Compulsory-age inmates shall receive a minimum of one hour of instruction per\nday. An equal amount of instruction will be made available to other entitled inmates upon request.\n42. Educational services shall be provided to an inmate in special or segregated housing using the least\nrestrictive method consistent with a determination by DOC that the inmate presents a clear threat to teachers,\nstaff, the inmate, or other inmates. In order to place an inmate in a more restrictive method of educational\nservices, DOC shall make a written determination in accordance with title 9, section 7070.7 of the New York\n551 Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations that the inmate presents a clear threat in any lesser *551 restrictive\noption. The mere fact that an inmate has been charged or convicted of a disciplinary infraction shall not be a\nsufficient basis for restricting or denying the provision of educational services.\n43. No restriction or exclusion from educational services shall be in effect for longer than fourteen days, except\nas provided in title 9, section 7070.7 of the New York Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations.\n44. Inmates who are disabled and identified as in need of special education or related services shall continue to\nreceive such services even if placed in a restricted method of instruction. If necessary, an IEP or TEP may be\nmodified in accordance with 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(4) and 34 C.F.R. § 300.346, consistent with legitimate\npenological objectives. In the event this occurs, such modifications shall be the least restrictive necessary to\naccommodate the security needs of the jail.\n45. Each eligible inmate receiving educational services, even if according to a restricted method of instruction,\nshall receive bilingual instruction if required by the individual student.\nReappointment of the Monitor\n46. Assuming Dr. Sheri Meisel is willing, the court hereby reappoints her to serve as a monitor from September 1,\n2002, through August 31, 2004. The monitor will assess the City defendants' compliance with this order and\nprovide the court and counsel with semi-annual reports specifically identifying any areas of noncompliance. The\n\nreports may also contain recommendations for further modifications to the Education Plan as amended by this\nOrder. The monitor in her report may also recommend specific changes in BOE and DOC policies and\nprocedures.\n47. The monitor shall have the same access to Rikers Island, to plaintiffs and defendants, and to relevant\ndocuments, and shall have her expenses reimbursed and receive the rate of compensation as during her prior\nappointment as monitor.\nModification and Enforcement\n48. Any party may move for reconsideration of any part of this Order within thirty days of its entry. This Order will\nremain in full force and effect during the pendency of any motion for reconsideration unless and until the court\nprovides otherwise. Any motion for reconsideration must comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this\ncourt's Local Rules, and relevant case law.\n49. After thirty days following entry of this Order, any party may seek modification of this Order only if there has\nbeen a material change in circumstances or within thirty days of issuance of one of the monitor's semi-annual\nreports.\n50. Either party may move to enforce or terminate this Order under the governing legal standards established by\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, any relevant statutes, and applicable case law.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Mary Belle Harris, the first woman to head a federal prison, recognized the importance and utility of educating\nprisoners over seventy-five ago. See Joseph W. Rogers, Mary Bell Harris: Warden and Rehabilitation Pioneer,\nWomen & Crim.Just., Vol. 11, No. 4, at 5 (2000); Esther Heffernan, The Alderson Years, Fed. Prisons J., Vol. 3,\nNo. 1, at 21 (Spring 1992). Recent studies have confirmed what Ms. Harris believed long ago 00 that inmates who\n97\nreceive schooling while in prison are less likely to return there after release. See Tamar Lewin, Inmate Education\nIs Found to Lower Risk of New Arrest, N.Y. Times, Nov. 16, 2001, at A22.\n[2] Section 175.5(a)(3) also indicates that it applies to students in \"grades seven through 12.\" Inmates at Rikers\nIsland are not divided into \"grades.\" Rather, they are divided into three groups for instructional purposes: Basic,\nPre-GED, and GED. See Lisante Decl. ¶ 12. Section 175.5(a)(3) would therefore seem to not apply for this\nreason as well.\n[3] For example, one mathematics course outline indicates that a topic for week 9 is \"Review the Cartesian\nPlane.\" The fact that the Cartesian Plane is being reviewed implies that it was covered previously. Indeed, it was\n00 6 weeks earlier, during week 3.\n97\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

After several years of litigation, the district court (Constance Baker Motley, Judge) granted a\ndeclaratory judgment to the plaintiffs, concluding that the defendants had failed to provide such services, and\nordered the defendants to create a plan for doing so. The court later adopted the defendants' proposed plan and\nappointed a third party to monitor the plan's execution for one year.\nUpon receiving the third-party monitor's final report, the district court entered an injunction ordering the\ndefendants to comply with the terms of their educational plan and to provide additional required services to\neligible inmates. The defendants appealed and we vacated the injunction, remanding for the district court to\nconsider whether Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002), required the plaintiffs to\nexhaust administrative remedies. See Handberry v. Thompson, Nos. 02-0251, 02-0279 (2d Cir. Nov. 27, 2002)\n(order). The district court concluded that Porter did not require exhaustion in this case, and reinstated the\ninjunction. The New York City defendants (the \"City defendants\") now appeal, arguing that the district court erred\nin its application of federal and state law. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.\nBACKGROUND\nThe district court thoroughly set forth the facts underlying this dispute. See Handberry v. Thompson, 92\nF.Supp.2d 244 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (\"Handberry I\"), and Handberry v. Thompson, 219 F.Supp.2d 525 (S.D.N.Y.2002)\n(\"Handberry II\"). We recite them here only insofar as we think it necessary to explain our resolution of this appeal.\nThe instant lawsuit arises out of a complex of allegations that the New York City Department of Education\n(\"DOE\") and Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") have failed to provide inmates incarcerated at New York City's\n\nvast Rikers Island prison facility with sufficient educational services and facilities to meet standards imposed by\nfederal and state law. On August 14, 1996, the plaintiffs filed suit on behalf of themselves and others similarly\nsituated, \"in order to receive the educational services guaranteed them by law.\" Compl. ¶ 1. They assert that the\nDOE and DOC provided \"less than half of school-eligible persons incarcerated by DOC with [state and federally]\nmandated educational services,\" id., and that they did not provide general education services to all eligible\ninmates or special education services to school-eligible inmates with disabilities. The plaintiffs further contend\nthat the defendants thereby violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth\nAmendment; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1482; 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (the \"Rehabilitation Act\"); the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (the \"ADA\"); and New York State law and regulations. The plaintiffs\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief \"requiring [the defendants] to provide all mandated educational services\nto all school-eligible persons.\" Compl. ¶ 3.\nOn October 21, 1996, defendant Richard Mills, the Commissioner of the New York State Education Department,\nmoved to dismiss the complaint on the ground, inter alia, that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust all available\n57 administrative remedies. *57 As discussed below, both the IDEA and the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(a) (the \"PLRA\"), establish exhaustion prerequisites for bringing suits such as this one. The City\ndefendants opposed the motion to dismiss. They asserted that, as of that time, there were no applicable\nadministrative remedies for the plaintiffs to exhaust, although the City defendants purported to reserve the\nexhaustion argument pending discovery. On May 28, 1997, the district court denied defendant Mills's motion to\ndismiss.\nOn November 19, 1999, the district court directed the plaintiffs to file a motion for a declaratory judgment\nestablishing that their rights to receive education services had been violated and for an order directing the\ndefendants to file an educational plan for meeting their obligations to provide such services. The plaintiffs filed the\nmotion in December 1999. The City defendants cross-moved for summary judgment, asserting that the plaintiffs'\nclaims should be dismissed for failure to exhaust all available administrative remedies.\nOn January 13, 2000, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment and denied the\ndefendants' cross-motion. In addition to entering a declaratory judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, the district court\nordered the defendants to file an education plan to provide Rikers Island inmates with the educational services to\nwhich they were entitled by state and federal law. See Handberry I, 92 F.Supp.2d at 245. As the court later made\nclear, it entered the declaratory judgment to remedy both plaintiffs' claims of procedural due process violations\nand their claims under the IDEA, Rehabilitation Act, ADA, and state law. See Handberry II, 219 F.Supp.2d at\n531-32.\nOn May 3, 2000, the City defendants submitted their remedial education plan to the court. See Educ. Plan for the\nRikers Island Academies, Handberry v. Thompson, No. 96 Civ. 6161 (S.D.N.Y. May 3, 2000) (\"Education Plan\" or\n\"Plan\"). The Plan stated that, in accordance with the district court's order, it provided \"full and complete\neducational services and facilities to all eligible Rikers Island inmates,\" including both general and special\neducational services. Id. at 2. In an order dated June 29, 2000, the court adopted the Plan. Handberry v.\nThompson, No. 96 Civ. 6161 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2000) (order adopting Plan). The court did so \"only reluctantly,\"\n\"noting that the Plan would `not meet all the needs of incarcerated youth inmates' and that it was `deficient in\nmany respects.'\" Handberry II, 219 F.Supp.2d at 530 (quoting Order of June 29, 2000, ¶ 2). The court also\nappointed Dr. Sheri Meisel to monitor the defendants' efforts to implement the Plan and directed Dr. Meisel to\nsubmit a report containing her findings after one year.\nIn her final report submitted December 14, 2001, Dr. Meisel concluded that the Plan had \"not been a sufficient\nframework to guide and sustain compliance with general and special education requirements.\" Final Report of the\nCourt Monitor in Handberry v. Thompson Regarding the Implementation of the Education Plan for the Rikers\nIsland Academies, at 1, Handberry v. Thompson, No. 96 Civ. 6161 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.5, 2001) (the \"Final Report\" or\n\"Report\"). The Report continued: \"[A] substantial number of school-age individuals confined at Rikers Island\nconsistently received no educational services or substandard services.\" Id. Dr. Meisel \"identif[ied] specific\ndeficiencies concerning access to educational services including ineffective notification and recruitment\nprocedures, conflicting school and jail schedules, and lack of correctional officers for escort and security.\" Id. Dr.\n\n58 Meisel also noted that \"[s]pecial education and *58 related services are not provided to all eligible students, and\nthe delivery of special education is compromised by inadequate systems for screening and for individualized\neducation programs.\" Id.\nAfter receiving the plaintiffs' and the defendants' responses to the Final Report and conducting a hearing, the\ndistrict court issued an order adopting amendments to the Education Plan based on the Report. Handberry v.\nThompson, 219 F.Supp.2d 525 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.28, 2002) (order amending the City defendants' Education Plan)\n(\"August 28, 2002, Order\"). The court ordered, inter alia, that the defendants implement procedures to notify\ninmates of the education services available, take steps to provide general education services to all entitled\ninmates, provide escorts to enable inmates to attend class, comply with the terms of the IDEA in providing special\neducation services, and provide \"cell study\" to students in segregated housing. In an opinion issued the same\nday, the court set forth the reasons for the order. It observed that in ordering the injunctive relief, it relied solely on\nthose factual findings that were uncontested. Handberry II, 219 F.Supp.2d at 532.\nThe City defendants appealed. On November 27, 2002, we vacated the district court's order and directed it to\nconsider whether exhaustion of administrative remedies was required under Porter v. Nussle, supra, which the\nSupreme Court had decided subsequent to the district court's decision. See Handberry v. Thompson, Nos.\n02-0251, 02-0279 (2d Cir. Nov. 27, 2002) (order). The district court, after receiving submissions from the parties\nand conducting a hearing, concluded that no further exhaustion of administrative remedies was required. The\ncourt thereupon reinstated in full the injunction it had ordered on August 28, 2002, amending the City's Education\n[1]\nPlan. The City defendants now appeal.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Exhaustion Requirements\nOn appeal, the City defendants again argue that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust all available administrative\nremedies, and contend that the district court should therefore have dismissed the action instead of granting the\ndeclaratory judgment to the plaintiffs and ordering prospective relief.\nA. Exhaustion under the PLRA\nThe PLRA provides in pertinent part that:\nNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any\nother Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). In Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002), the Supreme\nCourt held that the PLRA's exhaustion requirement \"applies to all prisoners seeking redress for prison\ncircumstances or occurrences,\" id. at 520, 122 S.Ct. 983, irrespective of whether those conditions are general to\nall prisoners or affect only one prisoner in particular, see id. at 532, 122 S.Ct. 983. Previously, in Booth v.\nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.E.2d 958 (2001), the Supreme Court noted that the PLRA required\n59 exhaustion if available administrative process had the ability to provide *59 \"some relief for the action complained\nof\" (emphasis added), even if grievance procedures could not provide the relief sought, id. at 738-39, 121 S.Ct.\n1819. If no administrative remedies are available, however, then the PLRA does not require exhaustion. Id. at\n736 n. 4, 121 S.Ct. 1819 (\"Without the possibility of some relief, the administrative officers would presumably\nhave no authority to act on the subject of the complaint, leaving the inmate with nothing to exhaust.\"); see also \nMojias v. Johnson, 351 F.3d 606, 609 (2d Cir.2003) (\"[The PLRA] clearly does not require a prisoner to exhaust\nadministrative remedies that do not address the subject matter of his complaint.\" (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted)).\nAlthough the PLRA establishes a mandatory exhaustion requirement, it does not create a jurisdictional predicate\nto our ability to hear the appeal. Richardson v. Goord, 347 F.3d 431, 434 (2d Cir.2003). Therefore, \"[t]he failure to\n\nexhaust available administrative remedies is an affirmative defense . . . [that] is waiveable.\" Johnson v. Testman,\n380 F.3d 691, 695 (2d Cir.2004); accord Hemphill v. New York, 380 F.3d 680, 686 (2d Cir.2004).\nIn rejecting the defendants' argument that exhaustion was required, the district court relied on two alternative\ngrounds: that administrative remedies were not \"available\" and that, in any event, the defendants had waived the\naffirmative defense of non-exhaustion. With respect to the PLRA's exhaustion requirements, we agree with the\ndistrict court as to the second ground, and therefore need not and do not address the first.\nAs noted, in 1996 the City defendants opposed State defendant Mills's motion to dismiss the complaint based on\nthe plaintiffs' alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The City defendants argued that although the\nPLRA exhaustion requirement \"may, ultimately, be decisive,\" \"plaintiffs raise issues that, at this time, appear to be\noutside the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction.\" City Defs.' Mem. of Law in Opp. to State Def.'s Mot. to\nDismiss at 3, Handberry v. Thompson, No. 96 Civ. 6161 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.12, 1996). The City defendants argued to\nthe district court that it should dismiss the motion without prejudice pending discovery which, they contended,\nwould reveal whether \"any alleged problems with the delivery of educational services to incarcerated persons in\nthe custody of the Department of Correction are solely attributable to the Department of Correction, [in which\ncase] the matter would be grievable.\" Id. On May 28, 1997, the district court denied Mills's motion to dismiss.\nSome two years later, in November 1999, the City defendants cross-moved for summary judgment on the ground\nthat the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. In their arguments to the district court, they\nasserted that prison grievance procedures were available based on a Department of Corrections \"Directive\" that\nwas issued in 1985. See City Defs.' Summary Judgment Br. at 11, Handberry v. Thompson, No. 96 CV 6161\n(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 1999). This document, written and issued by the DOC, was available to the City Defendants\nbefore any discovery took place. And the district court noted that the director of DOC's Inmate Grievance\nProgram \"concluded that the inmates could have filed an inmate grievance concerning access to school\" based\nupon his \"review[ of] paragraphs 12-22 of the complaint.\" Handberry v. Thompson, No. 96 CV 6161, 2003 WL\n194205, at *4; 2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 1220, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2003).\nBy opposing Mills's motion on the grounds that there were no relevant available administrative proceedings, the\n60 City *60 defendants waived or conceded the inapplicability of the non-exhaustion defense with respect to prison\ngrievance procedures that were apparent without discovery. The grounds upon which the City defendants\nasserted a non-exhaustion defense in 1999 were based on information that was available to them prior to any\ndiscovery taking place. By asserting in 1996 that there were no available prison grievance procedures based on\nthe same information, the City defendants either waived any such claim or conceded that it was not available to\nthe plaintiffs.\nThis is not a purely technical matter. Had the City defendants asserted in 1996 that administrative proceedings\nwere available, the plaintiffs might have sought to exhaust any such proceedings before timely returning to\nfederal court. The plaintiffs were entitled to rely, instead, on the City defendants' assertion that, barring the\nemergence of new information during discovery, the plaintiffs had no administrative process available to exhaust.\nThe City defendants were not entitled to concede at the beginning of the litigation that prison grievance\nprocedures were not available only to assert the contrary three years later based on information available to them\nfrom the outset.\nWe therefore conclude that the City defendants waived or conceded on the exhaustion arguments that they make\n[2]\nto us now.\nB. Exhaustion under the IDEA\nThe City defendants also assert that the plaintiffs should have exhausted administrative remedies with respect to\ntheir federal claims pursuant to the IDEA, the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \"It is well settled that\nthe IDEA requires an aggrieved party to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing a civil action in\nfederal or state court. . . .\" J.S. v. Attica Cent. Sch., 386 F.3d 107, 112 (2d Cir.2004),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___,\n125 S.Ct. 1727, 161 L.Ed.2d 616 (2005). \"The [IDEA administrative review] process includes review by an\nimpartial due process hearing officer and an appeal from that hearing.\" Id. \"The [IDEA's] exhaustion requirement\n\nalso applies where plaintiffs seek relief under other federal statutes when relief is also available under the IDEA.\" \nId.; see also 20 U.S.C. § 1415(1).\nWe have not yet ruled on whether the IDEA's exhaustion requirements are subject to waiver. In Polera v. Board of\nEducation, 288 F.3d 478 (2d Cir.2002), the appellant admitted that she had failed to exhaust available IDEA\nadministrative remedies. Id. at 481. We noted our \"recogni[tion] that the IDEA's exhaustion requirement does not\napply in situations in which exhaustion would be futile because administrative procedures do not provide\nadequate remedies.\" Id. at 488 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, we concluded that\n\"absent an applicable exception,\" id., a plaintiff's failure to exhaust IDEA administrative remedies deprived the\ncourt of subject matter jurisdiction, id. at 483, 488-90.\nWe need not decide today whether the defendants' waiver of the non-exhaustion defense would constitute such\n61 an exception. IDEA exhaustion in the instant case is excused under the futility exception for *61 challenges\naddressing systemic issues. See J.S., 386 F.3d at 112.\nIn J.S., the plaintiffs brought a claim in which they alleged that they had been denied a free appropriate public\neducation under the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and New York law. Id. at 110. We noted that\n\"[t]he complaint was styled as a class action, and the district court described it as containing `complain[ts] of\nwrongdoing that [are] inherent in the program itself and not directed at any individual child.'\" Id. at 110 (second\nalteration added). \"[T]he plaintiffs' problems could not have been remedied by administrative bodies because the\nframework and procedures for assessing and placing students in appropriate educational programs were at\nissue, or because the nature and volume of complaints were incapable of correction by the administrative hearing\nprocess.\" Id. at 114. We therefore concluded that IDEA exhaustion was not required. Id. Unlike challenges with\nrespect to the content of a particular student's Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\"), J.S. addressed a \"total\nfailure to prepare and implement [IEPs].\" Id. at 115.\nSimilarly here, the plaintiffs challenge the DOE's and DOC's actions with respect to providing educational\nservices to all entitled inmates at Rikers Island. As we concluded in J.S., individual administrative remedies would\nbe insufficient to address the defendants' failure to provide the service required by the IDEA to all relevant\ninmates. See id. at 112. The purposes of exhaustion 00 to \"allow[] for the exercise of discretion and educational\n97\nexpertise by state and local agencies,\" id. (quoting Polera, 288 F.3d at 487) 00 are unavailing where the alleged\n97\nissue is the absence of any services whatsoever. Id. at 114-15. As to the plaintiffs' claim, then, exhaustion is\n[3]\nfutile, and administrative remedies are effectively unavailable.  We therefore conclude that the plaintiffs' failure\nto exhaust administrative remedies as required by section 1415(f)00(g), (i) for IDEA claims (and ADA and\n97\nRehabilitation Act claims for overlapping relief that would also be available under the IDEA as per section 1415(1\n)) does not bar our subject matter jurisdiction over this suit.\nII. Prospective Relief\nA. Prospective Relief for State-Law Claims\nSection 802 of the PLRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), provides that \"[p]rospective relief in any civil action with\nrespect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a\nparticular plaintiff or plaintiffs.\" The City defendants argue that the PLRA thus limits the district court's power to\norder prospective relief for violations \"solely of state law.\" Appellants' Br. at 52. We agree.\nCongress defined the term \"civil action with respect to prison conditions\" as \"any civil proceeding arising under\nFederal law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the\n62 lives of persons confined *62 in prison\" except for habeas corpus proceedings. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(2). The\ninstant civil proceeding, having been brought in part (and relief having been granted in part) under the IDEA, the\nRehabilitation Act, and the ADA, arises under Federal law, even if some of the claims prosecuted in the course of\nthe proceedings are state-law claims. This action also addresses \"the effects of actions by government officials\non the lives of persons confined in prison,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(2), because it challenges the adequacy of the\ndefendants' provision of educational services and related ancillary services to inmates. Thus, under the language\nof section 3626(a)(1), any prospective relief ordered in this case must \"extend no further than necessary to\ncorrect the violation of the Federal right of [these] particular . . . plaintiffs.\" (emphasis added).\n\nIn 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), Congress provided federal district courts with so-called supplemental jurisdiction to\ndecide certain state-law claims. It reads:\nExcept as provided in [other] subsections [of section 1367] . . . or as expressly provided by\nFederal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district\ncourts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the\naction within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under\nArticle III of the United States Constitution.\nId. The plaintiffs argue that under these provisions, the district court had jurisdiction over any state-law claims\nrelated to the federal claims being adjudicated and, therefore, that the court had the power to vindicate fully those\nstate-law rights. For us to read 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A) to prohibit prospective relief on such state-law claims,\nthey contend, would be for us to read it to impliedly repeal 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) in part. Such \"implied repeals,\"\nthey point out, are not favored by courts, which assume that Congress generally does not intend to enact laws in\nconflict with its own earlier statutes without saying so. \"[A]bsent a clearly established congressional intention,\nrepeals by implication are not favored. An implied repeal will only be found where provisions in two statutes are in\nirreconcilable conflict, or where the latter Act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as\na substitute.\" Lockhart v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 699, 704, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\nHere, though, Congress explicitly contemplated that other statutes would limit the supplemental jurisdiction\ngranted in section 1367, which provides that such jurisdiction may be limited \"as expressly provided by Federal\nstatute.\" By its terms, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A) appears to be such a \"Federal statute.\"\nTrue, on occasion, when Congress has limited section 1367, it has referred explicitly to jurisdiction. See, e.g., 42\nU.S.C. § 13981(e)(4) (providing that section 1367 shall not \"be construed, by reason of a claim arising under\nsuch subsection, to confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction over any State law claim seeking the\nestablishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of marital property or child custody decree\"). It hardly\nfollows, however, that Congress must make specific reference to section 1367 in order to limit its reach. Indeed,\nCongress likely did not do so here because section 3626(a) limits not jurisdiction, but rather the types of\nremedies available once jurisdiction has been properly invoked.\n63 The only provisions of section 3626 that refer explicitly to state law claims further *63 support this reading of the\nstatute. Section 18 U.S.C. § 3626(d) reads, \"State law remedies. 00 The limitations on remedies in this section\n97\nshall not apply to relief entered by a State court based solely upon claims arising under State law.\" This provision\nappears to clarify the scope of section 3626(a)'s remedial limitations. Since section 3626(a)(1) states that \"in any\ncivil action\" (emphasis added) related to prison conditions prospective relief shall be narrowly drawn, section\n3626(a) would appear to operate to limit the remedial powers of both federal and State courts in such cases. This\nlimitation includes two elements: First, it limits the extent of such relief to that which is \"no further than necessary\nto correct the violation;\" second, it narrows the permissible grounds for prospective relief by requiring that it be\nissued only to remedy violations of \"the Federal right\" in the case. Therefore, if a State court were hearing a civil\naction involving both state and federal claims, section 3626(a) would not only require that any prospective relief\nfor a federal claim \"extend no further than necessary to correct\" its violation, but would also seem to prevent that\ncourt from ordering any prospective relief at all for violations of the state law claims. But such a result would\nclearly infringe upon a state's traditional power to grant its courts a full range of remedial powers. Thus,\nsubsection (d) was included to foreclose this result.\nSubsection (d) explicitly carves out an exception for State courts from the requirement that prospective relief go\n\"no further than necessary to correct the violation\" and remedy only \"the Federal right\" in the case, so the blanket\nrestriction on prospective relief must apply to all civil actions related to prison conditions in federal courts. But\nsince, under this view, the restriction both limits the extent of the relief and requires that it remedy a federal right,\nwe think section 3626 clearly prohibits a federal court from issuing preventive relief based entirely upon state-law\n[4]\nclaims.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing analysis that the district court was not permitted to order prospective relief to remedy\nan asserted violation of state law only. We thus agree with the City defendants that the district court erred in\nordering such relief, and we vacate those portions of the injunction 00 paragraphs three through five, seven, nine\n97\nthrough eighteen, thirty-nine through forty-three, and forty-five00 that appear to be based solely on asserted\n97\nviolations of state law.\nB. Prospective Relief for Federal Law Claims\nWith respect to remedies of federal law violations, the PLRA provides that \"[t]he court shall not grant or approve\nany prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary\nto correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of\nthe Federal right.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1); see also Benjamin v. Fraser, 343 F.3d 35, 56 (2d Cir.2003) (\"[T]he\nPLRA requires the court to make particular findings . . . when it identifies [federal] violations.\").\n\"Although the PLRA's requirement that relief be `narrowly drawn' and `necessary' to correct the violation might at\n64 first *64 glance seem to equate permissible remedies with [legal] minimums, a remedy may require more than the\nbare minimum [federal law] would permit and yet still be necessary and narrowly drawn to correct the violation.\" \nBenjamin, 343 F.3d at 54. A remedy may be deemed to be properly drawn if it provides a practicable \"means of\neffectuati[on]\" even if such relief is over-inclusive. Id. (concluding that comprehensive window repair program at\nprison was necessary to remedy due process violation and narrowly drawn \"[g]iven the impracticability of the\ncourt examining each window\").\nThe district court acknowledged that it was required to make \"need-narrowness-intrusiveness\" findings under the\nPLRA. See Handberry II, 219 F.Supp.2d at 533. It noted that \"[m]uch of the relief requested by plaintiffs falls\nbeyond the scope of `least intrusive' and `narrowly drawn.'\" Id. The court decided, however, that \"the City\ndefendants, by their own admission or by failing to dispute the findings of the monitor, remain non-compliant with\napplicable state and federal law after years of litigation\" and that the court was \"therefore compelled to order\ncompliance.\" Id. The court concluded that \"[t]he order filed herewith . . . is crafted in a way that is narrowly drawn\nand extends no further than necessary to achieve compliance while keeping in mind public safety and the\noperation of the criminal justice system.\" Id. The court further made specific findings regarding the defendants'\nprovision of educational services. The City defendants argue that the court nonetheless did not satisfy the\nPLRA's \"need-narrowness-intrusiveness\" requirements.\n1. Applicability of Injunction to All DOC Inmates. The City defendants contend that paragraph six of the injunction,\nwhich \"purports to apply [its terms] to all DOC facilities\" is \"overbroad\" because \"[t]he plaintiff class . . . consists\nonly of inmates who, inter alia, are incarcerated at DOC facilities on Rikers Island.\" Appellants' Br. at 55 (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (citing Handberry II, 219 F.Supp.2d at 530).\nWhile the district court did describe the plaintiff class as consisting of inmates housed on Rikers Island, see \nHandberry II, 219 F.Supp.2d at 530, the plaintiff class \"is defined as all inmates under the age of twenty-one in\nthe custody of the New York City Department of Correction who have not yet received their high school diploma\nor its equivalent.\" Handberry v. Thompson, No. 96 Civ. 6161 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.20, 1996) (stipulation and order for\nprovisional class certification and notice to the class). We are aware that the defendants' Education Plan and the\nspecial monitor's final report address solely the provision of services at Rikers Island jails. We think it is clear that\nthis is because, as evidence submitted by the City defendants seems to establish, DOE only provides\neducational services at Rikers Island jails; inmates at DOC's remaining four jails, the \"Borough Houses\" must\ntransfer to a Rikers Island jail to receive such services. Am. Decl. of Esteban Colon ¶¶ 10-11, Handberry, No. 96\nCiv. 6161 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.21, 1999). Thus, the district court did not err in ordering relief on the basis of the facts\nbefore it for the entire class. We therefore reject the City defendants' contention that paragraph six is\nimpermissibly broad.\n2. IDEA Screening Provisions. The \"Child Find\" provisions of the IDEA establish that the state must have \"policies\nand procedures to ensure that\" \"[a]ll children with disabilities . . . in need of special education and related\nservices[ ] are identified, located, and evaluated and [that] a practical method [must be] developed and\n65 implemented to determine which children *65 with disabilities are currently receiving needed special education\n\nand related services.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A). In its opinion, the district court declared that although the\nEducation Plan \"listed five different mechanisms for identifying inmates eligible to receive special education and/\nor related services[,] . . . the City defendants have failed to consistently rely on these mechanisms.\" Handberry II,\n219 F.Supp.2d at 540. Paragraph nineteen of the injunction thus requires the defendants to \"comply with the\nrequirements of 20 U.S.C. § 1421(a)(3)(A), 34 C.F.R. § 300.125, and 34 C.F.R. § 300.300(a)(2), and [to]\nimplement screening procedures to locate, identify, and evaluate all eligible inmates with disabilities.\" August 28,\n2002, Order ¶ 19.\nWe do not see how this prospective relief, which tracks the statutory language of the IDEA's Child Find\nrequirement precisely, can be viewed as unnecessary, overbroad or over-intrusive. The City defendants\nnonetheless argue that the district court's order was improper because the court \"found no inmates with a\ndisability who should have been referred for evaluation, but were not.\" Appellants' Br. at 55. But we fail to see\nhow this contention relates to the question of whether the City defendants have failed to meet their affirmative\nobligation to screen eligible inmates for disabilities. Indeed, the IDEA's apparent purpose in requiring screening is\nto find eligible inmates who might otherwise not be identified00without an effective screening mechanism in place,\n97\nit is impossible for the City defendants, or anyone else, to identify inmates who should be referred for evaluation.\nWe therefore reject their argument with respect to paragraph nineteen of the injunction.\n3. Initial Meeting with Special Education Team. In paragraphs twenty-one and twenty-two of the injunction, the\ndistrict court ordered that inmates identified as in need of special education services meet with a \"school based\nsupport team or pupil personnel team\" within five days. August 28, 2002, Order ¶¶ 21-22. The court further\nordered that \"[t]he purpose of this meeting shall be to determine if identification and assessment of that inmate as\nin need of special educational services is appropriate. If so, then an initial evaluation for special education shall\nbe performed pursuant to the procedures set forth in 20 U.S.C. §§ 1414-1415 and their implementing\nregulations.\" Id. ¶ 22.\nThe IDEA requires that the state ensure that \"[c]hildren with disabilities are evaluated in accordance with\nsubsections (a) through (c) of section 1414 of this title.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(7). Thus, the educational agency\nmust \"conduct a full and individual initial evaluation . . . before the initial provision of special education and\nrelated services\" and \"such initial evaluation shall consist of procedures . . . to determine the educational needs\nof such child.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(1). The evaluation thus mandated by the IDEA constitutes a significant step\ntoward developing the IDEA's primary device for delivering special education services: the IEP. See 20 U.S.C. §\n1412(a)(4); Lillbask ex rel. Mauclaire v. Conn. Dep't of Educ., 397 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005). The IEP, developed\nby educators in conjunction with the child's parents, sets forth a specific and particularized plan for each child's\ndevelopment. It must contain, inter alia, a statement of the child's goals and steps to be taken to transition the\nchild to the least restrictive environment. See id. §§ 1412(a)(4), 1436(d). Because of the timing constraints\nassociated with the transient nature of the Rikers Island population, the defendants use a Temporary Education\n66 Plan (\"TEP\") for students with disabilities that \"serve[s] *66 as the student's IEP until release from Rikers Island\nand entrance into a school program where a new, more permanent IEP is required.\" Rikers Island Standard\n[5]\nOperating Procedures 4 (July 1997) (\"Rikers Island SOP Manual\").  A TEP appears to be similar in most\nrespects to an IEP, although it is developed based on a single diagnostic academic placement test rather than, as\nwith the IEP, using multiple assessment tools. See August 28, 2002, Order ¶¶ 17-18; 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(2).\nThe City defendants challenge the terms of injunction paragraphs twenty-one and twenty-two, contending that\nfederal law does not \"require[] that a three-person team of education professionals meet[] with every inmate who\nneeds or may need special education, within five days of the inmate's special education identification or referral.\"\n[6]\n Appellants' Br. at 56.\nWe disagree. Coming as it does after a finding that the City defendants had failed to fulfill their screening and\nevaluation requirements and had not lived up to the terms of the Education plan, see Handberry II, 219\nF.Supp.2d at 540, the injunction's requirement that the City defendants comply with the terms of the IDEA meets\nthe \"need-narrowness-intrusiveness\" requirements of the PLRA; it is not unnecessary, overbroad, or over-\nintrusive for the district court to require the City defendants to comply with the terms of the Act based upon a\nfinding that the City defendants are not presently doing so. And the district court's requirement that students meet\nwith a student based support team (\"SBST\") or a pupil personnel team is based on the Rikers Island SOP\n\nManual, which sets forth that the SBST's major role is to develop educational plans for students with disabilities.\nThat statement does not appear to us to be merely hortatory, aspirational or rhetorical. We therefore do not see\nhow the court's order that the defendants comply with the requirements of the IDEA by using procedures based\non requirements of their own SOP manual is, at least under the circumstances presented, either overbroad or\nover-intrusive. Cf. Benjamin, 343 F.3d at 54 (finding prospective relief to satisfy PLRA requirements appropriate\nwhere it was based on \"DOC's own policy directive.\").\nThe City defendants also contend that the five-business-day deadline within which the City defendants are to\nprovide students who have been identified as having disabilities with an initial meeting in order to assess whether\na TEP is necessary is \"overly burdensome.\" Appellants' Br. at 56. The Rikers Island SOP Manual states that\nTEPs must be developed for \"all students with disabilities attending a Rikers Island school,\" Rikers Island SOP\nManual at 2, and that \"every effort will be made\" to provide students with TEPs prior to their release, id. at 4. In\ntheir brief to us, the City defendants point out that the Rikers Island population is \"primarily transient\" and suggest\n67 that most students leave Rikers Island within ten to thirteen *67 business days of their incarceration. Appellants'\nBr. at 7. We do not think that, under these circumstances, the district court's requirement is in this regard\nunnecessary, overbroad, or over-intrusive.\n4. Provision of TEPs. In paragraph twenty-six of the injunction, the district court ordered the DOE to develop\nTEPs for students who do not have current IEPs within thirty school days of enrollment. In deciding to order this\nrelief, the court concluded that the City defendants had failed to develop and implement TEPs and had thereby\ndeprived students of the special education services to which they are legally entitled. Handberry, 219 F.Supp.2d\nat 541-42. The City defendants do not contest this conclusion. They argue instead that the thirty-school-day\ndeadline for TEP implementation is \"excessively burdensome,\" Appellants' Br. at 57, because existing Rikers\nIsland procedures establish a twenty-school-day waiting period before the SBST team must meet with the\nstudent to begin developing a TEP. As we have noted, however, those procedures also state that \"every effort will\nbe made to ensure that students have a TEP prior to their release from Rikers Island.\" Rikers Island SOP Manual\nat 4. And the City defendants report that \"most entitled inmates are incarcerated for less than 30 calendar days,\"\nAppellants' Br. at 57 n. 24, and that the majority are released after ten business days, id. at 7. These facts\nsuggest that, by the City defendants' own procedures, students should be provided with a TEP within less than\nthirty days. In light of the fact that the deadline for TEP development is more generous than that which would\nlogically follow from the City defendants' own procedures, we do not think that the thirty-school-day deadline for\nTEP implementation fails the PLRA's \"need-narrowness-intrusiveness\" test. See Benjamin, 343 F.3d at 55.\nThe defendants also assert that the last two sentences of paragraph twenty-six of the August 28, 2002, Order\ncontravene the IDEA by \"eviscer[ating] the parental informed consent requirements.\" Appellants' Br. at 57. Those\nsentences provide: \"The TEP shall be created by an IEP/TEP team in accordance with 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B)\nand 34 C.F.R. § 300.344. If for any reason a required member of the IEP/TEP team fails to participate (either in\nperson or telephonically), the reason(s) for his or her nonparticipation shall be documented in the TEP itself.\"\nAugust 28, 2002, Order ¶ 26. Under 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B), the IEP team is defined to include a disabled\nchild's parents, and under 34 C.F.R. § 300.344, the DOE \"shall ensure\" that the IEP team includes the child's\nparents. However, \"[a] meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the public agency is unable to\nconvince the parents that they should attend. In this case the public agency must have a record of its attempts to\narrange a mutually agreed on time and place. . . .\" 34 C.F.R. § 300.345(d). The August 28, 2002, Order, in\nrequiring that the City defendants comply with applicable law, and in mandating that the reasons for absence of a\nrequired member be noted \"in the TEP itself,\" August 28, 2002, Order ¶ 26, reinforces rather than \"eviscerate[s]\"\nthe requirements of the IDEA.\nThe City defendants further contend that paragraph twenty-seven of the injunction, which requires that a TEP\nshall, inter alia, \"include measurable annual and short term academic and social/behavioral objectives as\ndetermined to be necessary for each student to improve performance,\" August 28, 2002, Order ¶ 27, is overbroad\n68 because \"all items, except annual goals and dates for initiation and duration *68 of services, are already listed on\na TEP\" and \"annual goals are meaningless in a jail setting.\" Appellants' Br. at 58. On this issue, we agree with the\ndefendants. Although the IDEA requires that the IEP includes \"a statement of measurable annual goals, including\nacademic and functional goals,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II)(aa)-(bb), it would be absurd to apply annual\ngoals to students who only reside in the jail for a matter of weeks. Cf. Yerdon v. Henry, 91 F.3d 370, 376 (2d\n\nCir.1996) (\"Where an examination of the statute as a whole demonstrates that a party's interpretation would lead\nto absurd or futile results . . . plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole, that interpretation\nshould be rejected.\") (internal citation and quotation omitted); King v. St. Vincent's Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 221, 112\nS.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991) (\"[T]he cardinal rule [is] that a statute is to be read as a whole . . . since the\nmeaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context.\") (internal citation omitted). Thus, this provision\nof the PLRA does not apply to the plaintiffs in this case, and the section of paragraph 27 requiring adherence to\nannual goals is hereby vacated.\n5. Continuum of Services. In their Reply Brief, the City defendants assert for the first time that paragraphs thirty-\ntwo and thirty-four of the district court's injunction are overbroad. The City defendants contend that these\nprovisions \"are not based on any violation of an inmate's federal rights.\" Appellants' Reply Br. at 25. Paragraph\nthirty-two requires that \"[a] range of special educations services shall be available . . . to meet the needs of\ndisabled students, including but not limited to, general classroom instruction, with supplementary aids and\nservices, skills support classes, resource rooms; and self-contained classes for students with intensive needs.\"\nAugust 28, 2002, Order ¶ 32. The district court concluded that the City defendants' \"amorphous one-size-fits-all\n`skills class' either taught by a special education teacher or by a subject area teacher in consultation with a\nspecial education teacher . . . is less than what the City defendants are required to provide under the terms of the\noriginal Education Plan and falls far short of the sort of individualized services required by the IDEA.\" Handberry,\n219 F.Supp.2d at 543.\nUnder the IDEA, the City defendants must provide \"[a] free appropriate public education.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)\n(A); see also id. § 1400(d)(1)(A) (stating that such free appropriate public education must \"emphasize[] special\neducation and related services designed to meet their unique needs\"). In so doing, the City defendants must\n\"ensure that a continuum of alternative placements is available to meet the needs of children with disabilities for\nspecial education and related services,\" including \"instruction in regular classes [and] special classes,\" and the\n\"provision for supplementary services []such as resource room.\" 34 C.F.R. § 300.551; see also id. §§ 300.5,\n300.301. The City defendants do not dispute that they did not provide the required continuum of services to\nstudents with disabilities. We are unpersuaded by their argument that the district court erred in ordering them to\ndo so.\nSimilarly, paragraph thirty-four requires that the DOC furnish space to enable the DOE to provide counseling\nservices. The IDEA requires that the DOE provide related services, including counseling. 34 C.F.R. § 300.24(a).\nThe district court found that the space provided for such counseling was inadequate. The City defendants\nresponded that they would make space in the George R. Vierno Center available for counseling. The court\n69 incorporated *69 this response into the order. We do not see how this portion of the order can be deemed\nunnecessary, overbroad, or over-inclusive.\n6. Responsibility for Costs of Special Monitor. The City defendants argue that paragraph forty-seven \"should be\nvacated to the extent that it requires City defendants and the State to pay for the special monitor\" on the ground\nthat \"these expenses should be borne by the judiciary\" under 18 U.S.C. § 3626. Appellants' Br. at 59. Section\n3626(f)(4) establishes that, if the court appoints a \"special master,\" his or her compensation must be \"paid with\nfunds appropriated to the Judiciary.\" Id. § 3626(f)(4).\nThis argument is foreclosed by our decision in Benjamin v. Fraser, supra. There we concluded that the Office of\nCompliance Consultants (\"OCC\"), which had been appointed to monitor compliance with consent decrees\nconcerning prison conditions, was not a special master within the meaning of the PLRA. Benjamin, 343 F.3d at\n44-47. We reasoned that the OCC did not have \"the ability to convene and to regulate hearings, to rule on the\nadmissibility of evidence, to subpoena and swear witnesses, and to hold non-cooperating witnesses in\ncontempt.\" Id. at 45. We noted that \"[t]he master's responsibilities typically culminate in a report. If the report\nincludes findings of fact, they are binding in non-jury actions unless clearly erroneous.\" Id. We decided that while\nthe OCC's reports aided the court in assessing compliance efforts, the OCC did not exercise \"quasi-judicial\npower\" and was therefore not a special master. Id. at 47. The PLRA's requirements regarding the compensation\nof special masters therefore did not apply to OCC. Id.\nHere, the district court appointed Dr. Meisel to \"assess the City defendants' compliance with this order and\nprovide the court and counsel with semi-annual reports specifically identifying any areas of noncompliance.\"\n\nAugust 28, 2002, Order ¶ 46. The court determined that \"[t]he reports may also contain recommendations for\nfurther modifications to the Education Plan as amended by this Order\" and that \"[t]he monitor in her report may\nalso recommend specific changes in BOE and DOC policies and procedures.\" Id. In using the special monitor's\nfirst such report, the district court used it as an aid in assessing the City defendants' compliance with the terms of\nthe Education Plan and the requirements of the IDEA. See Handberry, 219 F.Supp.2d at 530. The court adopted\nspecific factual findings that it found to be uncontroverted by the defendants. Id. at 532. As is clear from this use\nof the monitor's previous report, and from the terms of the district court's order reappointing Dr. Meisel as special\nmonitor, Dr. Meisel has not been given a mandate to exercise quasi-judicial powers, such as finding facts that\nwould be binding on the court absent clear error. See Benjamin, 343 F.3d at 45. We conclude that Dr. Meisel is\nthus not a \"special master\" within the meaning of the PLRA. The City defendants' argument that paragraph forty-\nseven is invalid thus fails.\nIII. Due Process\nThe district court granted a declaratory judgment to the plaintiffs on the overlapping grounds that the DOE's and\nDOC's failure to provide the educational benefits to which the plaintiffs are entitled violated state and federal law\nand constituted a deprivation of property without due process. See Handberry;219 F.Supp.2d at 531-32; \nHandberry, 92 F.Supp.2d at 248-49. The plaintiffs argue that they have a property interest in a public education\n70 and, second, that the defendants *70 have deprived them of their property interest without due process of law.\nWe note at the outset that the relief sought by the plaintiffs 00 that the defendants provide them with substantive\n97\neducational services 00 hardly seems well suited to remedy a procedural violation. But because we conclude that\n97\nthe plaintiffs do not possess a property interest in any particular educational conditions, we need not reach the\nissue of whether the relief sought would be an appropriate remedy for the deprivation of such a property interest.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment does not protect a public education as a substantive fundamental right. See San\nAntonio Indep., Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 35, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) (\"Education, of\ncourse, is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution.\"); Plyler v. Doe, 457\nU.S. 202, 221, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (\"Public education is not a `right' granted to individuals by\nthe Constitution.\"). The plaintiffs nevertheless contend that they have a property interest in a public education,\nthat such a property interest continues during their incarceration, and that the defendants' failure to provide them\nwith adequate educational services deprives them of that interest without due process of law.\nIn order for a benefit to qualify as a property interest, the person claiming it must have a \"legitimate claim of\nentitlement\" to the benefit, rather than a mere \"unilateral expectation of it.\" Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,\n577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). In determining whether a party has a legitimate claim to a benefit,\n\"we look to the statutes and regulations governing the distribution of benefits.\" Kapps v. Wing, 404 F.3d 105, 113\n(2d Cir.2005). We will find there to be a property interest if the relevant statutes and regulations \"meaningfully\nchannel[] official discretion by mandating a defined administrative outcome.\" Sealed v. Sealed, 332 F.3d 51, 56\n[7]\n(2d Cir.2003).\nThe plaintiffs rely primarily on two provisions of state law in arguing that they have a property interest in a public\neducation. First, New York's Constitution directs that \"[t]he legislature shall provide for the maintenance and\nsupport of a system of free common schools, wherein all the children of this state may be educated.\" N.Y. Const.\nArt. 11, § 1. It does not appear that this provision alone gives rise to a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" by\n\"children of [the] state\" because on its face it requires only that the legislature maintain a public school system.\nBut the plaintiffs also rely on New York's education laws, which provide in part that \"[a] person over five and\nunder twenty-one years of age who has not received a high school diploma is entitled to attend the public schools\nmaintained in the district in which such person resides without the payment of tuition.\" N.Y. Educ. L. § 3202(1).\n71 *71 The statutory provision does appear to create a property interest in education protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See Mitchell C. v. Bd. of Educ., 67 A.D.2d 284, 288, 414 N.Y.S.2d 923, 926 (2d Dep't 1979)\n(\"[W]here a State or subdivision thereof undertakes to provide a free education to all students, it must recognize\nan individual student's legitimate entitlement to a public education as a property interest protected by the due\nprocess clause. . . .\"); see also Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 573, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975) (holding\nthat \"on the basis of [Ohio] law, appellees plainly had legitimate claims of entitlement to a public education\").\n\nIt does not follow, however, that such a property interest continues unaffected during incarceration, as the\nplaintiffs contend. Indeed, a later section of the statute specifically covers educational services during\nincarceration. Section 3202(7) directs that:\nA person under twenty-one years of age who has not received a high school diploma and who is\nincarcerated in a correctional facility maintained by a county or by the city of New York or in a\nyouth shelter is eligible for educational services pursuant to this subdivision and in accordance\nwith the regulations of the commissioner.\nN.Y. Educ. L. § 3202(7). This provision makes clear that the statute treats youths who are incarcerated differently\nthan those who are not. Whereas section 3202(1) directs that any person under twenty-one without a high school\ndiploma \"is entitled to attend the public schools\" (emphasis added) in their district without payment, section 3202\n(7) provides that such persons who are incarcerated are \"eligible for educational services . . . in accordance with\nthe regulations of the commissioner\" (emphasis added). Section 3202(7) thus does not appear to give rise to the\nsame type of \"legitimate expectation\" of an educational benefit that section 3202(1) does.\nNo New York court has, to the best of our knowledge, yet addressed the question of whether section 3202(7)\ncreates a property interest for the purpose of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Many courts,\nhowever, have interpreted a similar statute that governs educational services for adults in prisons. N.Y. Correction\nLaw § 136 provides in relevant part:\nThe objective of correctional education in its broadest sense should be the socialization of the\ninmates. . . . To this end each inmate shall be given a program of education which, on the basis of\navailable data, seems most likely to further the process of socialization.\nId.\nCourts analyzing this provision have been reluctant to find that inmates have a property interest in such\n\"socialization\" programs. In Clarkson v. Coughlin, 898 F.Supp. 1019 (S.D.N.Y.1995), on which the plaintiffs rely,\nthe district court granted declaratory relief for hearing-impaired inmates who asserted that the state had failed to\noffer them reasonable accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. But the court rejected\nthe plaintiffs' argument that N.Y. Correction Law § 136 created a property interest in educational programs. In so\nholding, the court recognized that \"some property interest is created\" by section 136, but it noted that \"given the\ndiscretionary function of corrections officials which is inescapable in the language of the statute, only the\nprovision of no education at all or education that was wholly unsuited to the goals of a particular inmate's\nsocialization and rehabilitation trigger those protections.\" Id. at 1041 (emphasis added).\n72 *72 Other courts, both before and after Clarkson, have uniformly rejected plaintiffs' arguments that section 136\ngives rise to protected property interests. See Wright v. Coughlin, 31 F.Supp.2d 301, 311 (W.D.N.Y.1998);\n(\"Prison officials need not provide an educational program tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the\ninmate.\"); Giano v. Cuomo, 1998 WL 760262, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17215 (N.D.N.Y.1998) (holding that a\nUruguayan plaintiff did not have a protected interest in an educational program geared towards his native culture\nand language); Allah v. Coughlin, 190 A.D.2d 233, 237, 599 N.Y.S.2d 651, 654 (1st Dept. 1993) (holding that\nsection 136 \"does not entitle petitioners to any specific education or the right to take a high school equivalency\nexam free of charge\"); Jones v. Grunewarld, 644 F.Supp. 256, 259 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (holding that section 136 does\nnot provide an inmate a protected property interest in a scholarship); Lane v. Reid, 575 F.Supp. 37, 39\n(S.D.N.Y.1983) (holding that section 136 does not provide inmates a protected property interest in both a full-time\neducation and a full-time job).\nIf only a complete lack of education or one \"wholly unsuited\" to the statutory goals constitutes a deprivation of a\nproperty interest under section 136, there are several reasons to conclude that the same is required to constitute\na deprivation of a property interest for the purposes of section 3202(7).\nFirst, the language of section 136 is more categorical than that of section 3202(7), suggesting that the latter is, if\nanything, less likely to give rise to a property right than is section 136. Whereas section 3202(7) provides only\nthat certain persons would be \"eligible\" for education, section 136 directs that inmates \"shall be given a program\n\nof education.\" (emphasis added). It would be odd if the former provision created a \"legitimate claim to\nentitlement,\" while the latter did not.\nSecond, the judicial interpretations of section 136 cited above are in accord with the Supreme Court's and this\nCircuit's interpretations of federal prison programs. See, e.g., Moody v. Daggett, 429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct.\n274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976) (\"Congress has given federal prison officials full discretion to control these conditions\nof confinement . . . and petitioner has no legitimate statutory or constitutional entitlement sufficient to invoke due\nprocess.\") (citation omitted); Lee v. Governor of State of N.Y., 87 F.3d 55, 58 (2d Cir. 1996) (deciding that a rule\nrendering inmates ineligible for a temporary release program did not give rise to an interest protected by the\nFourteenth Amendment).\nFinally, the extensive regulations promulgated pursuant to section 136 and section 3202(7) are similar. See 9\nN.Y.C.R.R. § 7677 (2005) and 8 N.Y.C.R.R. § 118 (2005). Each set of regulations provides, inter alia, minimum\nhours of instruction, § 7677.4(e) and § 118.4(b), mandatory levels of education (in both cases, high school\nequivalency), § 7677.4(2) and § 118.4(c)(4)(i), and specialized services for students with learning disabilities, §\n7767.4(3) and § 118.2(b). Indeed, the regulations governing adult education under section 136 appear to be, if\nanything, more demanding than those governing youth under section 3202(7). Section 7766.4(4), for instance,\nrequires that bilingual programs be designed to meet the needs of non-English speakers, while no comparable\nprovision can be found in section 118 for non-English speaking youth. Thus, if section 136 does not give rise to a\n\"legitimate claim of entitlement\" to anything more than an education while incarcerated that is not \"wholly\nunsuited\" to the legislature's goals, neither, we think, does section 3202(7).\n73 *73 Education was not completely denied to the plaintiffs in the case at bar. They concede that the defendants\nhave provided the minimum number of hours required by the regulations. And indeed, we affirm the district court's\njudgment insofar as it incorporates paragraph 8 of the injunction, ensuring that the defendants continue to\nprovide the regulatory minimum of fifteen hours per week of instruction. The plaintiffs cannot support any further\ninjunctive relief, however, on the basis of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIV. Abstention\nThe City defendants argue that the district court should have abstained from deciding this case under Railroad\nCommission of Texas v. Pullman, 312 U.S. 496, 498-501, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). We review for\nabuse of discretion a district court's decision regarding abstention. Planned Parenthood v. Steinhaus, 60 F.3d\n122, 126-27 (2d Cir.1995); Bethphage Lutheran Serv., Inc. v. Weicker, 965 F.2d 1239, 1244 (2d Cir.1992). \nPullman abstention may be appropriate where a claim implicates an unresolved or unclear issue of state law. See\nCatlin v. Ambach, 820 F.2d 588, 589 (2d Cir.1987). We do not think that the New York State law at issue here is\nso unclear that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to decline to abstain. See Steinhaus, 60 F.3d at\n126-27. \"The regulations at issue are neither ambiguous nor unintelligible, nor are they rendered `unclear' [even\nif] no state court has yet construed them.\" Id. at 126. We therefore reject the City defendants' argument that the\ndistrict court erred in this respect.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm those portions of the judgement of the district court insofar as it is based on\nfederal law and vacate those portions based purely on state law. Specifically:\nWe vacate the judgment of the district court insofar as its injunction appears to be based exclusively on state law:\n¶¶ 3-5, 7, 9-18, 39-43, 45. We also vacate paragraph 27 on the ground that, although based on federal law, it\nmakes little sense to require the assessment of inmates relative to \"annual goals\" in this context.\nWe also affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it enjoins conduct that appears to be based primarily\non federal statutory law: ¶¶ 6, 19, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, 31-32, 34, 37, 44, 46-7. We also affirm the judgment insofar\nas it contains paragraph 8 of the injunction on the basis of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIt is not entirely clear to us whether the remaining substantive paragraphs of the injunction, ¶¶ 20, 23, 25, 29, 30,\n33, 35, 36, 38, are based primarily on state law or federal law. We therefore vacate those portions of the\n\njudgment and remand with instructions that the district court determine which, if any, of these parts of the\ninjunction are \"necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs,\" 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(a)(1)(A), and limit the injunction thereto.\n[1] State defendant Mills filed a notice of appeal, but later withdrew that notice by stipulation and order. [Docket #\n156].\n[2] The City defendants appear also to assert that they did not waive the non-exhaustion defense with respect to\nplaintiffs' claims for escort services because \"depositions revealed that . . . a number of inmates had escort\nproblems getting to school.\" Appellants' Br. at 40. However, the \"escort\" claim was apparent from the face of the\ncomplaint, see Compl. ¶ 84, and this assertion of failure to exhaust, if indeed it is that, is therefore similarly\nwaived.\n[3] To the extent the PLRA of its own force requires the exhaustion of IDEA administrative remedies, that\nexhaustion requirement does not bar the instant suit with respect to plaintiffs' IDEA, ADA, or Rehabilitation Act\nclaims. First, as discussed in the previous section, the City defendants waived any such arguments. Second,\neven if Porter's or Booth's requirements with respect to PLRA exhaustion applied (or even if the reasoning of \nPorter and Booth applied independently to IDEA exhaustion), we conclude that there are no available IDEA\nadministrative remedies and therefore Porter and Booth would not require exhaustion of such remedies as a\nprerequisite to bringing suit. See Porter, 534 U.S. at 520, 532, 122 S.Ct. 983; Booth, 532 U.S. at 736 n. 4, 121\nS.Ct. 1819.\n[4] The only other provision in section 3626 that explicitly mentions state law is § 3626(c)(2)(B), which provides\nthat \"[n]othing in this section shall preclude any party claiming that a private settlement agreement has been\nbreached from seeking in State court any remedy available under State law.\" Here, too, the statute only protects\nstate law remedies in state courts from the PLRA's remedial restrictions.\n[5] We cite the Rikers Island SOP Manual not, of course, because it or other state sponsored rules are\nenforceable in this action, but for the limited purpose of supporting a conclusion that the remedies afforded by the\ndistrict court were not `overly burdensome.'\n[6] We note that the district court's injunction makes no mention of the number of members that comprise a\nschool based support team or pupil personnel team, but instead refers the defendants to such teams, as they\nhave established through the City defendants' own procedures. The City defendants' attempt to represent the\ndistrict court's order as overly intrusive, by pointing to the number of people on such team00which apparently\n97\nderives from the City defendants' own choice in that regard00fails.\n97\n[7] It is true that the Supreme Court has cautioned against relying on the type of language used in statutes and\nregulations in determining whether or not a protected interest has been created. See Sandin v. Connor, 515 U.S.\n472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (noting that the tendency of courts, in the wake of Hewitt v. Helms,\n459 U.S. 460, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), to focus on the particular language used in prison\nregulations \"creates disincentives for states to codify prison management procedures in the interest of uniform\ntreatment.\"). However, as the plaintiffs point out, Sandin was concerned with the proper definition of liberty\ninterests, not property interests. Perhaps for that reason, this Circuit has continued to focus on the type of\nlanguage used in a statute that is alleged by a party to have created a property interest. See, e.g., Kapps, 404\nF.3d at 113-14, and Sealed, 332 F.3d at 56.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
