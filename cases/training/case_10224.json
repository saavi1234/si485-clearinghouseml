    "summary": "<p>In 2000, four migrant reforestation workers, an Oregon labor organization, and one of its members filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court District for the District of Oregon, seeking redress for migrant reforestation workers recruited and employed by farm/forestry labor contractors in Oregon.  Plaintiffs alleged that in 1996, defendants recruited and hired workers from Mexico to work in Oregon and in doing so violated the Agricultural Migrant and Seasonal Worker Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq. (\"AWPA\"), and the Oregon Labor Contractors Registration Act, ORS 658.405 et seq. (\"OCRA\") by charging workers $1000 recruitment fees, visa fees, cost of transportation from Mexico to the U.S. and not paying the full amount of wages due.  Plaintiffs sought statutory damages, injunctive relief and class certification.</p><p>The District Court (Judge Garr M. King) granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification to address alleged past wrongs, but denied the request for an injunction permanently enjoining defendants from committing future violations.  In the same order, the Court granted defendants' partial summary judgment motion and dismissed as plaintiffs the Oregon labor organization and its members.  The case proceeded as a class action with the four migrant reforestation workers acting as representative plaintiffs.  Perez-Perez v. Progressive Forestry Services, Inc.,  F.Supp.2d, 2000 WL 40927 (D.Or. Jan. 19, 2000).</p><p>According to the PACER docket, the parties reached a settlement.  The Court held a fairness hearing on August 26, 2002 and entered a final order approving the settlement on September 16, 2002.  The settlement documents were filed by the parties under seal, so the terms of the settlement are unknown.</p><p></p>",

The defendants are Progressive Forestry Services, Inc., North American Labor \n4  Management, Inc., Robert Wade Zaharie, Bruce Campbell, and Efrain Valadez. \n5  3.  Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the defendants have violated various federal \n6  and state laws by charging workers recruitment fees, visa fees, and the cost of transportation \n7  from Mexico to the United States, by not paying the full amount of wages required for the work, \n8  and by committing certain other violations in the course of hiring workers.  Plaintiffs seek to \n9  recover damages on behalf of themselves and on behalf of others similarly situated for those \nlO  violations of law.  Defendants deny each of the claims against them, and to date the Court has \n11  made no ruling that any of these claims are valid or invalid.
