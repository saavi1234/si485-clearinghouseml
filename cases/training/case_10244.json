The defendants are the Missouri Department of Social Services, and the interim directors of the state Family Support Division and the state Division of Medical Services.  According to the named plaintiff, Julia M., Missouri terminated the benefits of her minor child, when, after a series of bank errors, the monthly premium was not deducted from Julia M.'s account in a timely fashion. Julie M. received the notice after the benefits already had been terminated. While the notice indicated a right to appeal, it did not indicate a right to continue benefits pending the outcome of the appeal or that the state had conducted any evaluation to determine eligibility for other benefits. </p><p>On June 25, 2007, the District Court (Judge Nanette K. Laughrey) certified the class, defining it as \"[a]ll children residing in Missouri and who are receiving or who will receive [Missouri SCHIP] health coverage and are required to pay a premium under [state law].\" </p><p>Judge Laughrey, however, did not immediately rule on the request of the representative plaintiff, identified as Julia M., to issue a preliminary injunction requiring the Missouri Department of Social Services to provide recipients with sufficient notice of disenrollment and continued benefits pending any appeal.</p><p>On February 2, 2008, the parties signed a Consent Decree in which the Defendants agreed to notify participants in SCHIP who have fallen behind in their payments. The notification must tell the participant that he/she has a right to appeal, and that during the appeals process he/she is entitled to continued benefits until the matter is resolved. Defendants also agreed to pay the plaintiffs over $165,000 in attorneys fees and expenses.   </p><p>The Court was to retain jurisdiction until October 15, 2008 in order to monitor the execution of the Consent Decree.</p><p></p>",

Scott, Director of the Missouri Department of Social \nServices, Janel Luck, Director oft he Family Support Division and Ian McCaslin, Director of \nthe MO BealthNet Division, ·and...their successors in office (hereinafter \"Defendants\"). \nThe \"lawsuit\" referred to in this agreement is the lawsuit styled J. WM v. Scott et al., \nNo. 07-4036-CV-C-NK.L in the United States District Court for the Western District of \nMissouri, Central Division.  The \"court\" referred to in this agreement is the United States \nDistrict Court for theW ~stem District ofMisso\\lri, Central Division.  Missouri Senate Bill \n577 amended state statutes concerning Medicaid and various medical assistance programs to \nrefer to \"recipients\" ofp rogram benefits as \"p~icipants.\" Wherever the term 'participant' is \nused in this agreement, \"participant\" shall be understood to have the same meaning as the \nterm ''recipient.\" Plaintiffs bring the lawsuit on behalf oft hemselves and a class ofMissouri \nchildren who were receiving or in the future will receive MC+ health coverage and are \nrequired to pay a premium under Mo.  Rev.  Stat.  §208.640.  Pla,intiffs enter into this. \nagreement by and through their attorneys Marc Cohan, Petra Tasheff, and Laura Redman of \nthe National Center for Law and Economic Justice and Steve Hitov of the National Health \nLaw Program. Defendants enter into this agreement by and through their attorney, E!nily A. \nDodge, Assistant Attorney General of the State of Missouri. \nFor due and good consideration recited herein, the parties agree and state as follows:: \n1.  The Lawsuit. Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that the Department of Social \nServices was not notifying MC+ participants of their right to an appeal and to notice and \nprovision of aid continuing pending a hearing before terminating coverage for non-payment \nof a premium. In their complaint, Plaintiffs also claimed Defendants were not performing ex \nparte reviews to determine participants' eligibility under another eligibility category prior to \nterminating MC+ coverage for non-payment of a premium.  On June 25,2007, the district \ncourt certified the Plaintiff Class.  On July 9, 2007, the district court entered a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining Defendants from tenninating the MC+ coverage of any Plaintiff Class \nmember due to non-payment without mailing a notice ten days p~or to terminating coverage \n1 \nCase 2:07-cv-04036-NKL   Document 74   Filed 02/08/08   Page 1 of 22\n\ninforming the participant of the right to request a hearing withip. ten days and to receive \ncontinued benefits pending the outcome of the hearing.  The preliminary injunction order \nfurther enjoined Defendants to conduct ex parte reviews of individual recipients' eligibility \nunder any other Medicaid program,  as  required by 42  C.P.R.  §435.930, a regulation \napplicable to  Medicaid  expansion programs  such as  MC+ under Title XIX,  prior to \nterminating MC+ benefits for non-payment of a premium. The parties agree that Missouri's \nState Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) for participants over 150% of the \nFederal Poverty Level (\"FPL\") is now administered and operated by Defendants under Title \nXXI of the Social Security Act, thus,  the portion of the district court's July 9, 2007, \npreliminary injunction order requiring Defendants to conduct ex parte reviews for class \nmembers prior to terminating benefits due to non-payment of a premium does not now apply \nto those persons. \n2.  Scope of Agreement. This agreement ~mbodies the enf4'e agreement and \nunderstanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein. The parties \nhereby declare and represent that no promise, inducement, or agreement not herein expressed \nhas been made, and the parties acknowledge that the terms and conditions ofthis agreement \nare contractual and not a mere recital. \n3.

Approval of Class Settlement and Dismissal of Claims \nA.  .  The parties hereto stipulate and agree· that under Federal Rilles of Civil \nProcedure 23(e) and 4l(a)(2) the United States District Court for the Western District of \nMissouri, Central Division,. must approve any settlement and dismissal ofPlaintiffs ~ claims. \nB.  hnmediatelyupon the Court's approval oft his Agreement, the parties \nwill seek an Order from the Court dismissing Plaintiffs' claims in their entirety under Rule \n41(a)(2) of the Fed~ral Rules of Civil Procedwe with prejudice for all acts or omissions \ncovered by those claims.

The parties hereto stipulate and agree that this agreement becomes effective \nand binding when and only when the United States District Court for theWe stern District of \nMissouri,  Central  Division,  approves  this  agreement  and  enters  an  order  retaining \njurisdiction for purposes of enforcement as agreed in subparagraph 4(B) of this agreement, \nand unless the parties agree to any changes to this agreement sought by\" the Court. \nD.  ·  The parties further agree that the notices attached to this Agreement as \nExhibits A through C will be ·sent to participants of benefits under Missouri's Title XXI \nSCRIP  as  set forth  in Paragraph 5 of this Agreement,' and that notification of such \nparticipants as pro~ded in Paragraph 5 fulfills Defendants' notice obligations under the \nterms of the Preliminary Injunction Order. \n5.

Rev. Stat. §\n208.640.”1  Specifically, Plaintiff asks the Court to enjoin Defendants (a) to notify all\nMC+ recipients who are disenrolled from MC+ health coverage for failure to meet\npremium requirements of their right to appeal prior to disenrollment; (b) to provide the\n1MC+ is a statewide medical assistance program for low-income families, pregnant women, and\nchildren under the age of 19.  The Court certified a class of such recipients in its June 25, 2007\nOrder [Doc. # 39]\n1\n\nopportunity for continued enrollment and aid pending a hearing; and (c) to first determine\nwhether such MC+ recipients are otherwise eligible for medical assistance.  Pending\nbefore the Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. # 11].  For the\nreasons set forth below, the Preliminary Injunction is granted.\nI. Regulatory Background \nMissouri’s State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a jointly funded\nstate and federal program that provides health assistance to uninsured, low income\nchildren whose family income is above the State’s Medicaid income limits, but who\ncannot afford private health insurance.  42 U.S.C. § 1397aa-jj.  Congress has provided\nthat states participating in such a joint program have two options for its implementation. \nThe state may either create (1) a separate child health program or (2) provide insurance\nthrough an expansion of its existing Medicaid program.  42 U.S.C. § 1397aa(a)(2); 42\nC.F.R. § 457.70(a)(1)-(2).  Both parties agree that Missouri has chosen the latter option\nby creating Medicaid MC+, a Medicaid expansion program under which  \nParents and guardians of uninsured children with incomes between one\nhundred fifty-one and three hundred percent of the federal poverty level\nwho do not have access to affordable employer-sponsored health care\ninsurance or other affordable health care coverage may obtain coverage\npursuant to this section. . . . The parents and guardians of eligible uninsured\nchildren pursuant to this section are responsible for a monthly premium\nequal to the average premium required for the Missouri consolidated health\ncare plan . . . .\n Mo. Rev. Stat. § 208.640.  However, if a participating parent fails to make a payment,\n“the child shall not be eligible for coverage under [Mo. Rev. Stat.] sections 208.631 to\n208.660 for six months after the department provides notice of such failure to the parent\n2\n\nor guardian.”  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 208.646.  At issue in this lawsuit is what amount of\nprocess is due to MC+ recipients before their benefits are terminated for nonpayment of\nthe required premium.\nWhen a state elects to provide health insurance for the children of the working\npoor through an expansion of its Medicaid program rather than through a separate child\nhealth program, the expansion program “must . . . [b]e consistent with the State's\nMedicaid State plan, or an approvable amendment to that plan, as required under title\nXIX [of the Social Security Act].” 42 C.F.R. § 457.70(c)(2).  Thus, as both parties agree,\nthe regulations governing Medicaid generally, 42 C.F.R. § 430 et seq., rather than those\ngoverning separate child health insurance programs specifically, 42 C.F.R. § 457 et seq.,\ndictate Missouri’s obligations to the participants in its Medicaid expansion program. \nUnder Title XIX of the Social Security Act and its implementing regulations,\nMissouri is obligated to provide a certain level of due process before it can terminate\nbenefits.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) (“A State plan for medical assistance must . . . (3)\nprovide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to any\nindividual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is denied or is not acted\nupon with reasonable promptness.”).  Therefore, “[a]t the time of any action affecting his\nor her claim,” “[t]he agency must . . . inform every applicant or recipient in writing--(1)\nOf his right to a hearing; (2) Of the method by which he may obtain a hearing; and (3)\nThat he may represent himself or use legal counsel, a relative, a friend, or other\nspokesman.”  42 C.F.R. § 431.206(b)(1)-(3),(c)(2).  With immaterial exceptions, the\n3\n\nnotice required under § 431.206(c)(2) must be mailed to the recipient “at least 10 days\nbefore the date of action,” 42 C.F.R. § 431.211, and must inform the recipient of \n(a) A statement of what action the State, skilled nursing facility, or nursing\nfacility intends to take;\n(b) The reasons for the intended action; \n(c) The specific regulations that support, or the change in Federal or State\nlaw that requires, the action; \n(d) An explanation of--(1) The individual's right to request . . . a State\nagency hearing; . . . and \n(e) An explanation of the circumstances under which Medicaid is continued\nif a hearing is requested.\n42 C.F.R. § 431.210.  Further, a “State agency must grant an opportunity for a hearing to .\n. . (2) Any recipient who requests it because he or she believes the agency has taken an\naction erroneously.” 42 C.F.R. § 431.220.  Although the Agency “may require that a\nrequest for a hearing be in writing,\n(b) The agency may not limit or interfere with the applicant's or recipient's\nfreedom to make a request for a hearing.\n(c) The agency may assist the applicant or recipient in submitting and\nprocessing his request.\n(d) The agency must allow the applicant or recipient a reasonable time, not\nto exceed 90 days from the date that notice of action is mailed, to request a\nhearing.\n42 C.F.R. § 431.221.  Most importantly, and with immaterial exceptions, \n(a) If the agency mails the 10-day . . . notice as required under § 431.211 . .\n. of this subpart, and the recipient requests a hearing before the date of\naction, the agency may not terminate or reduce services until a decision is\nrendered after the hearing . . . .\n42 C.F.R. § 431.230.  And finally, “[t]he agency must (a) Furnish Medicaid promptly to\nrecipients without any delay caused by the agency's administrative procedures; [and] (b)\n4\n\nContinue to furnish Medicaid regularly to all eligible individuals until they are found to\nbe ineligible.” 42 C.F.R. § 435.930.\nII. Factual Background\nUnder the MC+ program, families with an income between 151 and 300 percent of\nthe federally determined poverty level are required to pay a monthly premium for their\ninsurance benefits.  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 208.640.  For families with an income between 226\nand 300 percent of the poverty level, nonpayment of the premium after notice of\ndelinquency results in termination of benefits for six months.  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 208.646.  \nThrough a series of bank errors, JWM’s August MC+ premium was not\nautomatically deducted from her mother’s account in a timely fashion.  Defendants assert\nthat Julia M. was notified of the nonpayment by letter dated August 3, 2006 and told that\nshe had until August 15 to pay the premium or JWM’s benefits would be terminated. \nNeither party has produced this original letter to the Court, and there is a factual dispute\nas to what state officials told Julia M. during her efforts to get the premium paid.  In any\nevent, Julia M. received a second letter dated August 25 which stated as follows:\nThis is to confirm that your children’s MC+ health care coverage ended\neffective 8-23-2006.  MC+ coverage ended because the full premium of\n$156.00 was not paid.  Your children may not be eligible for MC+ health\ncare coverage for six (6) months. . . .\nYou have the right to appeal this decision.  You can ask for a hearing within\n90 days of the date of this letter by [calling or writing the Division of\nMedical Services].\n5\n\nDef. Sugg. Opp. Class Cert., Ex. A. [Doc. # 25-2].  Defendants admitted in their class\ncertification brief that “this notification letter is standard correspondence” sent to MC+\nrecipients who fail to pay their monthly premium.  Def. Sugg. Opp. Class Cert. at 5.\nFollowing the initiation of this lawsuit, J.W.M.’s MC+ coverage was voluntarily\nreinstated by the Defendants.  Because the Court found that termination without a pre-\ndeprivation hearing is an act capable of repetition yet evading review, the Court\nconcluded that J.W.M’s lawsuit was not moot.  After full consideration of the standards\nfor class certification, the Court certified a proposed class of “[a]ll children residing in\nMissouri and who are receiving or who will receive MC+ health coverage and are\nrequired to pay a premium under Mo. Rev. Stat. § 208.640.”  It is on their behalf that\nPlaintiffs now seek a preliminary injunction.\nIII. Preliminary Injunction\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that “whether a preliminary injunction should issue\ninvolves consideration of (1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of\nbalance between this harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other\nparties litigant; (3) the probability that movant will succeed on the merits; and (4) the\npublic interest.” Dataphase Systems, Inc. v. C L Systems, Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir.\n1981) (en banc).   “The burden of establishing the propriety of a preliminary injunction is\non the movant.”  Baker Elec. Coop. v. Chaske, 28 F.3d 1466, 1472 (8th Cir. 1994).\nA.  Irreparable Harm\n6\n\nAlthough Defendants contest the potential for irreparable harm to the plaintiff\nclass as speculative and unsupported by evidence, the Court concludes that the potential\nfor irreparable harm is patently obvious.  J.W.M.’s benefits were terminated and could\nnot be reinstated for six months because of a banking error.  A potential lapse in medical\ncoverage for the children of the working poor who are otherwise unable to pay for needed\nmedical attention is an irreparable harm of the highest order.  Although Julia M. has not\nproduced specific evidence that other children in the class would face the same potential\nharm, the “standard correspondence” letter issued by the Defendants when J.W.M.’s\nbenefits were terminated suggests that other MC+ recipients have received similar letters\nand therefore face the same potential for irreparable harm.  Counsel for the Defendants in\nfact indicated that it was the policy of the Department to send out such letters when\ntimely payments were not received.  .  \nB. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nAt oral argument, Defendants also contested the likelihood of Plaintiffs succeeding\non the merits.  However, from the evidence presently before the Court, namely the\ntermination letter of August 23, 2006, and the admissions by defense counsel that such\ncorrespondence is “standard,” the Court finds a high probability of success on the merits.\nThe regulations which both parties agree govern the state’s obligations under the MC+\nprogram require that “[a]t the time of any action affecting his or her claim,” “[t]he agency\nmust . . . inform every applicant or recipient in writing--(1) Of his right to a hearing; (2)\nOf the method by which he may obtain a hearing; and (3) That he may represent himself\n7\n\nor use legal counsel, a relative, a friend, or other spokesman.”  42 C.F.R. § 431.206(b)(1)-\n(3),(c)(2).  With immaterial exceptions, the notice required under § 431.206(c)(2) must be\nmailed to the recipient “at least 10 days before the date of action,” 42 C.F.R. § 431.211,\nand must inform the recipient of \n(a) A statement of what action the State, skilled nursing facility, or nursing\nfacility intends to take;\n(b) The reasons for the intended action; \n(c) The specific regulations that support, or the change in Federal or State\nlaw that requires, the action; \n(d) An explanation of--(1) The individual's right to request . . . a State\nagency hearing; . . . and \n(e) An explanation of the circumstances under which Medicaid is continued\nif a hearing is requested.\n42 C.F.R. § 431.210.  Further, a “State agency must grant an opportunity for a hearing to .\n. . (2) Any recipient who requests it because he or she believes the agency has taken an\naction erroneously.” 42 C.F.R. § 431.220.  Although the Agency “may require that a\nrequest for a hearing be in writing,\n(b) The agency may not limit or interfere with the applicant's or recipient's\nfreedom to make a request for a hearing.\n(c) The agency may assist the applicant or recipient in submitting and\nprocessing his request.\n(d) The agency must allow the applicant or recipient a reasonable time, not\nto exceed 90 days from the date that notice of action is mailed, to request a\nhearing.\n42 C.F.R. § 431.221.  Most importantly, and with immaterial exceptions, \n(a) If the agency mails the 10-day . . . notice as required under § 431.211 . .\n. of this subpart, and the recipient requests a hearing before the date of\naction, the agency may not terminate or reduce services until a decision is\nrendered after the hearing . . . .\n8\n\n42 C.F.R. § 431.230 (emphasis added).  And finally, “[t]he agency must (a) Furnish\nMedicaid promptly to recipients without any delay caused by the agency's administrative\nprocedures; [and] (b) Continue to furnish Medicaid regularly to all eligible individuals\nuntil they are found to be ineligible.” 42 C.F.R. § 435.930.\nThe only correspondence in the record pertaining to the termination of J.W.M.’s\nMC+ benefits arrived, at the earliest, on the date benefits were actually terminated. \nAlthough the Defendants suggested at oral argument that Julia M. received a prior notice\non August 3, that letter is not before the Court and there is no way of knowing what rights\nit informed Julia M. of.  The letter that has been filed with the Court provides only that\n“coverage ended effective 8-23-2006 . . . because the full premium of $156.00 was not\npaid.  Your children may not be eligible for MC+ health care coverage for six (6)\nmonths.”  Although the letter also notified Julia M. of her “right to appeal” by requesting\n“a hearing within 90 days of the date of this letter,” this “standard correspondence” from\nthe state agency makes no mention of J.W.M.’s right to have her benefits continued\npending the outcome of that hearing under 42 C.F.R. § 431.230.  Perhaps when the record\nis more fully developed, the state will be able to produce evidence that shows the missing\nAugust 3 letter did so apprise Julia M. of her rights to a hearing and to continued benefits\npending its outcome, but that evidence is not presently before the Court. \nDefense counsel also admitted during oral argument that no ex parte review of\nJ.W.M.’s eligibility for continued benefits under any other Medicaid program was\nperformed prior to the termination of her benefits.  Counsel claims that any such review\n9\n\nwould be futile in J.W.M.’s case because the MC+ program is already a backstop\nprogram and represents coverage of last resort. Nevertheless, after this suit was filed, the\nstate did perform an ex parte review of J.W.M.’s status and determined that switching to a\nMedicaid spenddown program based on disability would be cost ineffective.  Pl. Reply,\nEx. A.  Irrespective of the conclusion in J.W.M.’s case, the fact remains that the state\ndoes not routinely preform ex parte reviews of eligibility before benefits are terminated,\nas required by 42 C.F.R. § 435.930.  Thus, the likelihood of success on the merits on this\npoint is also high. \nC.  Remaining Factors\nAs for the balance between the harm to plaintiffs and the injury that granting the\ninjunction would inflict on other parties, as well as a consideration of the public interest,\nthe Court concludes that both weigh in favor of granting the preliminary injunction.  If the\ninjunction is granted, the state will be required to rewrite its notices of nonpayment, grant\npre-deprivation hearings to those who request them, and continue benefits pending the\noutcome of such hearings, none of which is a trivial expense.  However, such\nexpense–which the regulations would seem to require anyway–is easily outweighed by a\npotential six-month lapse in health care coverage for children of the working poor.  This\nis particularly true in the case of the Named Plaintiff since the bank error resulting in the\ncoverage lapse would likely have been established and rectified while coverage remained\nin place if Plaintiff had just been given a pre-deprivation hearing.  The public interest is\nalso overwhelmingly served by resolving such errors quickly at a hearing while benefits\n10\n\nremain in place rather than forcing potentially expensive emergency room visits for\nuninsured children who are unable to pay for the cost of their care.  In sum, the Court is\nsatisfied that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden to demonstrate that the Dataphase\nfactors weigh in their favor.\nIV. Conclusion\nAccordingly, it is hereby\nORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motions for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. # 11] is\nGRANTED.  Defendants are ENJOINED from terminating any class member’s benefits\nfor nonpayment without mailing a notice of pending termination to the recipient ten days\nprior to the termination which informs the recipient of her right to request a hearing\nwithin ten days and to receive continued benefits pending the outcome of that hearing. \nDefendants are further ENJOINED to conduct ex parte reviews of individual recipients’\neligibility under any other Medicaid program prior to termination of benefits. \ns/ Nanette K.

Ms. M \nbrings this .action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Article VI ofthe United States Constitution on \n' .   . \nbehalf of herself and her minor daughter and a class of needy Missouri children challenging \ndefendants' policies and practices of discontinuing desperately-needed medical benefits without a) \nnotifying them of their right to an appeal; b) notifying them of and providing the opportunity for \ncontinued em-ollment and coverage pending the outcome of an appeal; and c) first determining \nwhether they are otherwise eligible for medical assistance under another eligibility category, all in \n\nviolation of federal law. \n2.  Plaintiffs bring this action for declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf ofthemselves \nand a class ofMC+ recipients who are subject to the SCRIP cost-sharing premium under Mo. Rev. \nStat. § 208.640 and those who are subject to the six-month disenrollment penalty provisions under \nMo. Rev. Stat.  § 208.646, and for whom the defendants have failed to  a) provide written notice of \ntheir right to an appeal upon termination from the program; b) provide notice of and aid paid pending \nthat appeal; and c) first determine whether the recipients are otherwise eligible for medical assistance \nas required by federal law . \n3.  Plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining the defendants to: a) \nnotify all MC+ recipients who are disenrolled from MC+ health coverage for failure to meet \npremium requirements of their right to appeal; b) notice and provision of the opportunity for \ncontinued enrollment and aid paid pending a hearing; and c) first determine whether such MC+ \nrecipients are otherwise eligible for medical assistance under another eligibility category. \n4.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the challenged policies and practices violate: \na) 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(3), its implementing regulations at 42 C.F.R. §§ 431.206(b) and 431.230, \nand the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the u.S. Constitution, \nwhich, inter alia,  require notice of fair hearing rights and aid continuing while the hearing is \npending; b) 42 U.S.C. § 1397aa-jj and its implementing regulations at 42 C.F.R. § 457.1170, which, \ninter alia,  require defendants to provide the opportunity for continued enrollment pending the \ncompletion of a review of disenrollment, including decisions to disenroll for failure to pay cost \nsharing premiums; and c) 42 § U.S.C. 1396(a)(8) and its implementing regulation at 42 C.F.R. § \n435.930(b), which prohibits discontinuing medical assistance benefits without first determining \n2 \n\nwhether the child is otherwise eligible for medical assistance. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Article VI ofthe U.S. Constitution \n(the Supremacy Clause) as an action seeking redress oft he deprivation of statutory and constitutional \nrights under color of state law. \n6.  Jurisdiction over this action is conferred upon this court by 28 U.S.C. § 1331, which \nprovides for jurisdiction in the United States district courts of civil actions arising under the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. \n7.  Venue properly lies with this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 139l(b). \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff J.W.M. resides in Farmington, Missouri. \n9.  Plaintiff Julia M. resides in Farmington, Missouri. \n10.  Defendant Deborah E. Scott is the Director of the Missouri Department of Social \nServices (DSS).  She is responsible for the general administration and implementation of laws \nconcerning the social welfare oft he people ofthe State ofM  issouri, including the Medicaid program. \nDefendant Scott is designated the chief administrative officer oft he Department and is charged with \nits ultimate control and administration.  She is responsible for, inter alia, the administration of the \nState's Medicaid program and supervision oft he administration ofthe Medicaid and SCRIP program \nby the local social services districts. \n11.  Defendant Janel R.  Luck is the Interim Director of the Missouri Family Support \nDivision (FSD), a division ofDSS, and, as such, is responsible for the general administration of \npublic welfare programs in the State of Missouri, including determinations of eligibility for the \n3 \n\nMissouri SCHIP and Medicaid  program.  Defendant Luck is the designated chief administrative \nofficer of the DFS and holds ultimate administrative power within DFS subject to the supervision \nof Defendant Scott. \n12.  Defendant Steve Renne is the Interim Director of the Missouri Division of Medical \nServices (DMS), a division of DSS, and, as such, is responsible for the administration of the \nMissouri SCHIP and Medicaid program, including dis enrollment for failure to meet premium \nrequirements.  Defendant Renne is the designated Chief Executive Officer and holds ultimate \nadministrative power within the DMS subject to the supervision of Defendant Scott. \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \nSCHIP Framework \n13.  SCHIP is a jointly funded state and federal program that provides health assistance to \nuninsured, low-income children whose family income is above the State's Medicaid income limits, \nbut who cannot afford private health insurance.  SCHIP, Title XXI of the Social Security Act, is \ncodified at 42 U.S.C. § 1397aa-jj. \n14.  A state receiving federal matching funds for its SCHIP program must comply with the \nrequirements ofthe federal SCHIP Act and its implementing regulations promulgated by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS).  42 U.S.C. § 1397aa(a)(2). \n15.  Missouri operates SCHIP as part ofi ts Medicaid pro gram and accepts federal matching \nfunds for its program expenditures.  Missouri SCHIP recipients receive their medical coverage \nthrough Missouri's Medicaid/MC+ for Children category of assistance. \nMissouri's 1115 Waiver \n16.  HHS can waive certain federal Medicaid requirements upon receipt and approval of a \n4 \n\nwaiver proposal related to the coverage and delivery of health care services.  42 U.S.c. § 1315. \nCommonly known as Section 1115 Research and Demonstration Waivers, they must be couched in \nterms of an \"experimental, pilot, or demonstration project which, in the ju,dgment of the Secretary, \nis likely to assist in promoting the objectives\" ofthe Act. § 1315(a ).  Such waivers can be granted \nfor the period HHS finds necessary to enable the State to carry out the project, and are typically \napproved for five years and may be renewed upon completion.  § 1315(a)(1). \n17.  In 1998, HHS approved Missouri's request for a Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver \nextending medical assistance coverage to children under the age of nineteen whose family income \nis below 300 % of the federal poverty level (fpl) through the MC+ for Children program.  See MO \nMedicaid Section 1115 Demonstration Managed Care Plus No. 11-W-0012217.  In August 2003, \nHHS approved Missouri's request for an extension of its Section 1115 Waiver until March 2007. \nSee Department of Health and Human Services, Extension Approval Letter, Aug. 25, 2003.  In \nSeptember 2006, HHS accepted Missouri's amendment modifying its premium structure, w.hich had \nthe effect of expanding the number of recipients required to pay premiums. See Department of \nHealth and Human Services, Award Letter, Sept.  20,2006. The amendments were also approved \nuntil March 2007. ld. \n18.  Under the Tenns and Conditions of Missouri's 1115 Waiver, all requirements ofthe \nMedicaid program including 42 U.S.C. § 1396a, implementing regulations, and policy statements \nthat are not expressly waived as not applicable, shall apply to the Medicaid/MC+ Program.  See \nMissouri 1115 Demonstration - Managed Care Plus Special Terms and Conditions, last updated \n9115106, Part III. \n19.  The statutes and regulations this complaint seeks to enforce have not been waived \n5 \n\nthrough Missouri's 1115 Waiver.  See Department of Health and Human Services, Award Letter, \nSept.  20, 2006; Department of Health and Human Services Approved Waiver and Expenditure \nAuthorities, Attachment 2. \nRight to Notice of and Continuing Aid Pending an Administrative Fair Hearing \n20.  Defendants must give notice of every recipient's right to a fair hearing and the method \nfor obtaining a fair hearing at the time of any action affecting her claim for benefits.  42 U.S.C.§ \n1396a(a)(3) and 42 C.F.R. 431.206(b) and (c). \n21.  Defendants must grant the opportunity for a fair hearing to any individual whose claim \nfor medical assistance is denied or terminated, and, when such a request has been made within ten \ndays oft he decision, defendants may not terminate or reduce services until a final determination after \na hearing has been made.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) and 42 C.F.R. § 431.230. \n22.  Defendants must ensure the opportunity for continuation ofSCHIP enrollment pending \nthe completion of review of a suspension or termination of enrollment, including a decision to \ndisenroll for failure to pay cost sharing.  42 U.S.C. § 1397aa-jj and 42 C.F.R. § 457.1170.  Cost \nsharing includes monthly premium charges that the enrollee is responsible for paying.  42 C.F.R. § \n457.10. \n23.  42 U.S.c. § U.S.C. 1396(a)(8) and 42 C.F.R. § 435.930(b) require defendants to \ndetennine a recipient's continuing eligibility for Medicaid under any alternative basis of eligibility \nbefore terminating Medicaid or SCHIP benefits because the recipient is no longer eligible under the \noriginal eligibility category. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO THE CLASS \n24.  In Missouri, families with incomes between 151 % and 300 % of the fpl are required \n6 \n\nto pay a premium for receipt of MC+ benefits.  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 208.640.  For families whose \nincome is between 226 % and 300 % of fpl, any child who fails to pay a required premium in a \ntimely manner is disenrolled from the MC+ program and is not eligible for MC+ coverage for six \nmonths after the department provides notice of such failure to the parent or guardian. Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 208.646, \n25.  There are approximately 3,000 children in Missouri who receive MC+ coverage and \nwhose family income is between 226 % and 300 % of fpI.  See Missouri Family Support Division, \nAnnual Report Data, Fiscal Year 2006, Page 16 (CHIP Premium Children). \n26.  Defendants fail and refuse to provide notification ofthe right to appeal and to provide \nMC+ benefits pending the outcome of an administrative fair hearing to those MC+ recipients who \ndefendants seek to suspend from participation in MC+ for at least six months due to an alleged \nfailure to timely pay the MC+ premium. \n27.  Missouri has the capacity to determine on an ex parte basis the eligibility of the \nplaintiffs, and the class they seek to represent, for continued enrollment in some other category of \nMedicaid assistance for those class members who are detremined no longer eligible in the MC+ \ncategory and requires such reviews to be conducted.  See Missouri Department of Social Services, \nFamily Support Division, Income Maintenance Manual, Medical Assistance for Families, MC+ \nHealth Care Coverage Manual, §§  0905.025.16 MAP / MC+ Closing Review Procedures and \n0905.025.16.05 Ex Parte Review. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n28.  The named plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and, pursuant to Rule 23(a) \nand (b )(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for certification of a class consisting of the \n7 \n\nfollowing members: \nAll children residing in Missouri and who are receiving or who will receive \nMC+ health coverage and are required to pay a premium under Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 208.640. \n29.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Approximately \n20,000 Missouri families are subject to the cost-sharing premium and approximately 3,000 are also \nsubject to the six month penalty upon failure to timely pay the premium. \n30.  There are numerous questions of law and fact common to the class as a whole \nconcerning defendants' policies and practices of dis enrolling eligible MC+ beneficiaries. At issue \nare the policies and practices of defendants of: (1) failing to notify those families of their right to a \nfair hearing upon disenrollment from the program; (2) failing to provide those families with the \nopportunity for continued enrollment pending completion of a review of such disenrollment; and (3) \nfailing to provide to those families an ex parte review to determine whether the MC+ beneficiary is \notherwise eligible for medical assistance. \n31.  Declaratory and injunctive relief are appropriate with respect to the class as a whole \nbecause the defendants have acted on grounds applicable to the class. \n32.  The named plaintiffs' claims are typical ofthe claims of the class. \n33.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nBecause of their indigence, the named plaintiffs are represented by the National Center for Law and \nEconomic Justice and the National Health Law Program, whose attorneys have litigated numerous \nclass actions, including three in this District.  Plaintiffs know of no conflicts of interest among \nmembers of the class. \n34.  A class action is superior to other available methods for a fair and efficient adjudication \n8 \n\nof this matter in that it will avoid numerous separate actions by class members. \nFACTS OF INDIVIDUAL NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nBackground \n35.  Plaintiff Julia M. and her minor daughter J.W.M.  live in Farmington, Missouri. \n36.  Since she was eight-years-old, after being involved in an accident, J.W. has suffered \nfrom numerous and severe medical and psychiatric conditions necessitating ongoing medical \ntreatment. \n37.  Throughout  the  subsequent  years,  J.W.  has  needed  constant  medical  attention, \nmedicines, and therapies.  Recently, she developed cysts on her face that require medication. \n38.  Due to her anxiety disorders, since Spring 2006, J. W. has not been able to attend school \nand has required home schooling. \nExperiences with MC+ Program \n39.  In June 2006, Julia M. applied for J.W. to be enrolled in the MC+ program, which \nrequired a $151 monthly premium. Thereafter, Julia M. received a letter dated June 20, 2006 stating \nthat coverage could start on July 1, 2006 if the $151 payment was made by that date and that if \npayment was received after that date, coverage would start on the date the payment was received. \n40.  Julia M. made the required premium payment by check on July 20, 2006. \n41.  On or about July 24, 2006, Julia M. received a notice stating that the premium payment \nhad been received and had been applied to J.W.'s coverage for July 20,2006 through August 19, \n2006.  This notice also advised that future payments could be made through an autowithdrawal by \nSUbmitting an attached form and voided check. \n42.  On or about July 24,2006, Julia M. received another notice stating that her monthly \n9 \n\npremium was now $156 and that payment was due on August 3,2006 for next month's coverage. \nThis notice also  advised that future payments could be made through an autowithdrawal by \nsubmitting an attached form and voided check.  This notice further stated that if payment was not \nreceived by August 23, 2006, coverage would stop and that, ifher income was above 225% ofthe \nfpl, her child would not be eligible for coverage for six months. \n43.  Pursuant to the previous notices, on August 4, 2006,  Julia M. chose to participate in \nthe autowithdrawal where future premium payments would automatically be deducted from her \naccount by providing defendants with a voided check and a completed auto withdrawal fonn. \n44.  On August 11, 2006, Missouri Social Services made a test run-through on Julia M.'s \naccount, but did not withdraw the premium payment. \n45.  Over the next few days, Julia M. continuously called the defendants' toll-free number \nand was never able to get through.  Julia M. then called her bank who informed her that normally, \nafter a run-through, defendants would take the payment out in a few days. \n46.  Not being able to get through to defendants or hearing anything to the contrary, Julia \nM. thoug!1t her account would be debited and the payment would cover the August premium. \n47.  On August 22,2006, a notice was sent to Julia M. which said that the $156 premium \nwould be taken out of her bank account on September 5, 2006 and, in bold, \"Do not mail a check \nor money order to pay your premium.\" \n48.  In September 2006, Julia M. went to speak with J.W. 's caseworker who informed her \nthat J.W.'s benefits had been canceled on August 24, 2006 because Julia M. had not paid the \npremium. \n49.  In late September 2006, Julia M. received a failure to pay notice dated August 3, 2006, \n10 \n\nwhich stated that she must pay the premium before August 24, 2006 or lW. would be disenrolled \nfrom MC+ for six months.  The letter was received after the dates mentioned. \n50.  None ofthe notices referenced above, including the notice stating thatJ. W. 's coverage \nwould be terminated for six months for failure to pay the premium, included a reference to the right \nto appeal. \n51.  Thereafter, Julia M. went to herlocal Family Support Division office to .a ppeal J .W.' s \ntermination.  She was told by the supervisor in charge, Robin Nolan, that the rules had changed and \nthere was no possibility of appeal from a termination for non-payment.  Ms. Nolan refused to give \nJulia M. this statement in writing or a copy of the new rule. \n52.  Subsequently, Julia M. sent a letter requesting a hearing to the Premium Collections \nUnit at the Division of Medical Services in Jefferson City, Missouri. \n53.  Julia M. never received a final cancellation notice nor any notice including her right to \nappeal or to receive aid pending an appeal. \n54.  In early January 2007, Julia M. received a document entitled Missouri Medicaid \nHearing Request.  She immediately filled it out and returned it to the Recipient Hearings Unit in the \nDivision of Medical Services. She has not heard anything since and a hearing date has not been set. \n55.  At the time of her dis enrollment, defendants  did not inform Julia M. that they had \nassessed whether J.W. could receive medical assistance under an alternative benefit category, such \nas Medical Assistance for Disabled Children, which provides medical assistance to children who \nmeet the Social Security Income definition of disability and certain income requirements. \nActual Harm Necessitating a Preliminary Injunction \n56.  As a result of J.W. 's dis enrollment, she has not been able to receive critical medicines \n11 \n\nand medical services.  Thus, she is no longer taking her eleven different anxiety and asthma \nmedicines. \n57.  J.W. has been forced to cancel an appointment with a neurologist in St. Louis and to \nforgo needed therapies.  She was also unable to attend her scheduled follow-up dermatologist \nappointments at St. Louis University's SLUCare program in order to deal with her cysts and facial \nscaring. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n58.
