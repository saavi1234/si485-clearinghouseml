    "summary": "<p>While we have few documents about his case, those available to us show that it began with a complaint filed in the Independence County (Arkansas) Circuit Court on May 16, 2005, by a permanent guardian for an incapacitated person residing in the Batesville Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a private facility evidently operated by Beverly Enterprises, Inc., Beverly Health and Rehabilitation Services, Inc., and Beverly Enterprises-Arkansas, Inc.  The guardian was represented by private counsel.  After amendment by the plaintiff on August 12, 2005, and September 13, 2005, plaintiff's complaint named the three corporations as defendants.  The plaintiff sought class action status for the case, and alleged claims of medical malpractice, negligence, breach of contract, and violations of the Arkansas Residents' Rights Act (\"ARRA\"), codified at Ark. Code Ann. §§ 20-10-1201 - 20-10-1209 (Repl. 2005), as to the guardian's ward, individually, and claims of breach of contract and violations of the ARRA, on behalf of all residents of the Batesville nursing home between September 13, 2000, and June 30, 2004. The plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys' fees, interest, and costs.  (Later, the guardian filed a third amended complaint that involved the same basic allegations but added as defendants all nursing home facilities in Arkansas owned and operated by the corporations and sought a class certification of all statewide residents of these facilities during certain specified dates; however, she filed a motion on July 19, 2006, to withdraw the statewide class allegations.  We do not have information about the resolution of that motion.)</p><p>On March 10, 2006, the guardian moved for certification of the class of people and estates comprising the residents of the nursing home between September 13, 2000, and June 30, 2004.  She also successfully moved to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice her claims against Beverly Enterprises, Inc., and Beverly Health and Rehabilitation Services, Inc.  On May 1, 2006, the circuit court entered an order granting class certification as to the Batesville nursing home residents, with respect to the contract and statutory claims only.  The circuit court specifically excluded claims for medical malpractice and personal injury from the class certification.  On July 19, 2006, the guardian moved to sever her individual claims on behalf of her ward for medical malpractice and negligence from the class claims.</p><p>The remaining corporate defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Arkansas from the class certification, claiming on appeal that class certification was inappropriate where the class claims, for statutory ARRA violations and for alleged breaches of individual admission agreements, would require resolution of each resident's liability, causation, and injury claims separately.</p><p>On June 21, 2007, that court affirmed the trial court's ruling.  The state Supreme Court's opinion first avoided ruling on the plaintiff's argument that the defendant was precluded from contesting the class certification, saying that the plaintiff had not properly preserved the argument for appeal, since she had not clearly raised it in the trial court nor addressed there the criteria concerning issue preclusion.  (The plaintiff's claim relied upon the assertion that the defendant had conceded to certification of a class action for settlement purposes in a similar, separate case in Bradley County (Arkansas) Circuit Court.)</p><p>The court then assessed the class certification against the state's applicable rule of civil procedure.  The factors applicable under that rule favored the trial court's ruling, especially since, according to the state's Supreme Court, one main and preliminary overarching issue existed in this case, which was whether the Batesville nursing facility was chronically understaffed so as to violate the residents' statutory and contractual rights.  The circuit court recognized that once the predominating staffing-related issues were resolved, the class could be decertified, if necessary, to determine individual restitution and damage issues for class members for the alleged breach-of-contract and statutory violations.  In so ruling, the court was within its' discretion, according to the Supreme Court. The claims of alleged under-staffing predominated over individual questions, where all class members' claims relied on the same resident admission agreement and the ARRA.   Moreover, use of a class action was a superior method to fairly and efficiently resolve the claims of the class, which numbered nearly 500 residents and estates, and the guardian would provide adequate representation of the class' interests, according to the appellate court.</p><p>The Arkansas Supreme Court distinguished the plaintiff's case from a ruling in another jurisdiction that had denied class action status in a nursing home conditions case, saying that that court used a different standard of analysis and that case involved negligence claims for each class member.  Here, the circuit court specifically excluded claims for medical malpractice and personal injury.  The class had been certified only for purposes of bringing statutory and contractual claims, not personal-injury claims. Furthermore, individual damages incurred by each class member would only be relevant during the second phase of this litigation, if necessary, and not during the liability phase.  Beverly Enterprises-Arkansas, Inc. v. Thomas, ---S.W.3d---, 370 Ark. 310, 2007 WL 1775708 (June 21, 2007) (Associate Justice Robert L. Brown).</p><p>We currently have no additional information about activity in this case.</p><p></p>",

CV-05-143-2,  HON.  JOHN  N.\nHARKEY, JUDGE,\nVS.\nANNETTE THOMAS, AS PERMANENT\nGUARDIAN OF THE ESTATE OF HELEN\nCOOK, AN INCAPACITATED PERSON,\nAND  ALL  OTHERS  SIMILARLY\nSITUATED,\nAFFIRMED.\nAPPELLEE,\nROBERT L. BROWN, Associate Justice\nThis is an appeal from an order granting a motion to certify the underlying class as a\nclass action.  We affirm the class certification.\nOn September 13, 2005, Annette Thomas, as permanent guardian of the estate of Helen\nCook, an incapacitated person, and all others similarly situated, filed a Second Amended\nComplaint1 in the Independence County Circuit Court against Beverly Enterprises, Inc.; Beverly\nHealth and Rehabilitation Services, Inc.; and Beverly Enterprises - Arkansas, Inc., d/b/a\nBatesville Nursing and Rehabilitation Center (“Beverly”).  The complaint alleged claims of\n1The original complaint was filed on May 16, 2005, and a First Amended Complaint\nwas filed on August 12, 2005. \n\nmedical malpractice, negligence, breach of contract, and violations of the Arkansas Residents’\nRights Act, codified at Ark. Code Ann. §§ 20-10-1201 – 20-10-1209 (Repl. 2005), as to Helen\nCook individually, and claims of breach of contract and violations of the Arkansas Residents’\nRights Act, on behalf of all residents of the Batesville nursing home between September 13,\n2000, and June 30, 2004.  According to the complaint, hundreds of individuals were admitted\nas residents at the Batesville facility during the stated time period, and all entered into a\nResident Admission Agreement with Beverly.  The complaint asserts that pursuant to the\nagreement, as well as the Residents’ Rights Act, Beverly was obligated to take care of the\nresidents’ basic daily needs.  The complaint further alleges that Beverly failed to meet this\nobligation by, among other things, failing to properly and adequately staff the facility and\nprovide a clean, safe living environment, which resulted in a loss of dignity for the residents.\nThe complaint includes a request that a class be certified consisting of all residents and estates\nof residents who resided in the Batesville facility from September 13, 2000, to June 30, 2004,\nand a prayer for compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, interest, and costs.\nThomas moved for certification of this class of people and estates on March 10, 2006,\nand sought appointment by the circuit court as class representative.2  Subsequently, Thomas\n2Thomas also filed a Third Amended Complaint that involved the same basic allegations\nbut added as defendants all nursing home facilities in Arkansas owned and operated by Beverly\nand sought a class certification of all statewide residents of these facilities during certain\nspecified dates. On July 19, 2006, Thomas filed a motion to withdraw these statewide class\nallegations. Based on the record before this court, this motion has not yet been decided. \n2\n\nmoved to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice her claims against Beverly Enterprises, Inc. and\nBeverly Health and Rehabilitation Services, Inc., which the circuit court granted.  A hearing\nwas then held on the motion for certification of the class involving the Batesville nursing home.\nOn May 1, 2006, the circuit court entered an order granting class certification with respect to\nthe contract and statutory claims only.  The circuit court specifically excluded claims for\nmedical malpractice and personal injury from the class certification.  On July 19, 2006,\nThomas moved to sever her individual claims on behalf of Helen Cook for medical malpractice\nand negligence from the class claims. \nIn the circuit court’s order, the court ruled that common questions of law and fact\nexisted as to the class, which is estimated at approximately 489 class members, and that these\ncommon issues related to understaffing predominated over individual questions because all\nclass members relied on the same Resident Admission Agreement and statutory law.  The court\nfurther found that Thomas’s claims arose from the same breach of agreement and violation of\nthe Residents’ Rights Act and were typical of the class.  The court also found that Thomas and\nher counsel were adequate to represent the class.  The court, as a final matter, ruled that a class\naction was the superior method to resolve the common liability issues fairly and efficiently.\nIn its appeal, Beverly contends that the circuit court erred in certifying the underlying\ncase as a class action.  More specifically, it asserts that a circuit court may only certify a class\nif the plaintiff meets his or her burden of proving the six criteria under Rule 23 of the Arkansas\nRules of Civil Procedure.  Beverly points out that Thomas alleges two causes of action for the\n3\n\nclass – one for violation of the Residents’ Rights Act and one for breach of the class members’\nResident Admission Agreement – and that both claims require that individualized questions of\nliability, causation, and injury for each resident be analyzed separately.\nWe begin by noting that circuit courts are given broad discretion in matters regarding\nclass certification and that this court will not reverse a circuit court’s decision to grant or deny\nclass certification absent an abuse of discretion.  See Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. v.\nPalasack, 366 Ark. 601, __ S.W.3d __ (2006).  When reviewing a circuit court’s class-\ncertification order, this court reviews the evidence contained in the record to determine\nwhether it supports the circuit court’s decision.  See id.  This court does not delve into the\nmerits of the underlying claims at this stage, as the issue of whether to certify a class is not\ndetermined by whether the plaintiff has stated a cause of action for the proposed class that will\nprevail.  See American Abstract & Title Co. v. Rice, 358 Ark. 1, 186 S.W.3d 705 (2004). \n  Rule 23 of the Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure provides the requirements for\ncertification of a class action.  That rule states:\n(a) Prerequisites to Class Action.  One or more members of a class may\nsue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions\nof  law  or  fact  common  to  the  class,  (3)  the  claims  or  defenses  of  the\nrepresentative party are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the\nrepresentative parties and their counsel will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.\n(b) Class Actions Maintainable.  An action may be maintained as a class\naction if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and the court finds that\nthe questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate\nover any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is\n4\n\nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\ncontroversy. . . .\nArk. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b) (2006).  Thus, six requirements must be met before a lawsuit can\nbe certified as a class action under Rule 23:  (1) numerosity; (2) commonality; (3) typicality;\n(4) adequacy; (5) predominance; and (6) superiority.  See Asbury Automotive Group, Inc.,\nsupra.  On appeal, Beverly is challenging the circuit court’s ruling as to three of these criteria:\npredominance, superiority, and adequacy.  As an initial matter, however, we must consider\nThomas’s assertion that Beverly is judicially estopped from challenging certification of this\nclass. \na.  Judicial Estoppel\nThomas argues with respect to this issue that Beverly is judicially estopped from\nchallenging the certification of the proposed Batesville class in Independence County because\nit conceded to certification of a class action for settlement purposes in a separate Bradley\nCounty Circuit Court case, Estate of Hampton, et al. v. Beverly Enterprises – Arkansas, Inc.,\net al., CV 2004-95-3, which entailed identical claims against Beverly.  \nThe doctrine of judicial estoppel has been discussed as follows by this court:\nA party asserts the doctrine of judicial estoppel by arguing that “a party may be\nprevented from taking inconsistent positions in successive cases with the same\nadversary.”  Dupwe v. Wallace, 355 Ark. 521, 529, 140 S.W.3d 464, 469\n(2004) (quoting Muncrief v. Green, 251 Ark. 580, 583-84, 473 S.W.2d 907,\n909 (1971)).  Moreover, there are four specific elements that must be proven in\norder to establish a prima facie case of judicial estoppel.  (1) a party must\n5\n\nassume a position clearly inconsistent with a position taken in an earlier case, or\nwith a position taken in the same case; (2) a party must assume the inconsistent\nposition with the intent to manipulate the judicial process to gain an unfair\nadvantage; (3) a party must have successfully maintained the position in an\nearlier proceeding such that the court relied upon the position taken; and (4) the\nintegrity of the judicial process of at least one court must be impaired or injured\nby the inconsistent positions taken.  Dupwe, 355 Ark. 521, 140 S.W.3d 464. \nCox v. Miller, 363 Ark. 54, 62-63, 210 S.W.3d 842, 847 (2005). \nWe conclude, however, that Thomas’s judicial-estoppel argument is not preserved for\nappeal.  It appears that she did not raise the elements of judicial estoppel to the circuit court\nor obtain a ruling on the issue.  Though she raised in her briefs in support of class certification\nand during the hearing the general point that Beverly had agreed to certification in the Bradley\nCounty Circuit Court case, which involved identical claims and issues, she never specifically\nargued the four elements of judicial estoppel to the circuit court, and, therefore, did not\npreserve the issue for our review.  See Cox, supra.  Furthermore, the circuit court did not\nspecifically rule on the issue of judicial estoppel.  This court will not consider arguments raised\nfor the first time on appeal; nor will it consider arguments when a party has failed to obtain a\nruling from the circuit court.  See Cox, supra. \nb.  Predominance\nBeverly argues that any common questions of fact or law that may be present in this\ncase do not predominate over individual issues.  It contends in this regard that the questions of\nfact the circuit court ruled were common to all class members cannot be resolved without\n6\n\ndetailed examinations of the individual circumstances of each class member.  It specifically\nasserts that the predominant issues raised in this case involve only individualized issues of\nliability, causation, and the existence and extent of injury for each class member. \nThis court has said that “the starting point in examining the predominance issue is\n‘whether a common wrong has been alleged against’ the defendant.”  American Abstract &\nTitle Co., 358 Ark. at 9-10, 186 S.W.3d at 710 (quoting USA Check Cashers of Little Rock,\nInc. v. Island, 349 Ark. 71, 83, 76 S.W.3d 243, 249 (2002)).  If a case involves preliminary,\ncommon issues of liability and wrongdoing that affect all class members, the predominance\nrequirement of Rule 23 is satisfied even if the circuit court must subsequently determine\nindividual damage issues in bifurcated proceedings.  See Farmers Ins. Co., Inc. v. Snowden,\n366 Ark. 138, __ S.W.3d __ (2006).  This court has recognized that a bifurcated process of\ncertifying a class to resolve preliminary, common issues and then decertifying the class to\nresolve individual issues, such as damages, is consistent with Rule 23.  See Mega Life &\nHealth Ins. Co. v. Jacola, 330 Ark. 261, 954 S.W.2d 898 (1997).  Furthermore,\n[t]he predominance element can be satisfied if the preliminary, common issues\nmay be resolved before any individual issues.  In making this determination, we\ndo not merely compare the number of individual versus common claims. Instead,\nwe must decide if the issues common to all plaintiffs “predominate over” the\nindividual  issues,  which  can  be  resolved  during  the  decertified  stage  of\nbifurcated proceedings.\nAsbury Automotive Group, Inc., 366 Ark. at 610, __ S.W.3d at __ (quoting Van Buren Sch.\nDist. v. Jones, 365 Ark. 610, 620, __ S.W.3d __, __ (2006)). \n7\n\nThe question then is whether there are overarching issues that can be addressed before\nresolving  individual  issues.    See  Asbury  Automotive  Group,  Inc.,  supra.    However,  if\npreliminary issues are individualized, then the predominance requirement is not satisfied.  See\nid.  Indeed, a case that presents numerous individual issues regarding the defendants’ conduct,\ncausation, injury, and damages will best be resolved on a case-by-case basis.  See Baker v.\nWyeth-Ayerst Lab. Div., 338 Ark. 242, 992 S.W.2d 797 (1999). \nWe conclude that one main and preliminary overarching issue does exist in this case,\nwhich is whether the Batesville nursing facility was chronically understaffed so as to violate\nthe residents’ statutory and contractual rights.  In its order, the circuit court found thirteen\nquestions of fact and law and five issues that must be resolved, which are common to all class\nmembers.  The five issues all involved understaffiing.  The court then found that the common\nfactual and legal issues predominated over the individual issues because all residents relied\nupon the same Resident Admission Agreement and statutory law to assert that systemic\nunderstaffing resulted in undignified living conditions for the residents, which breached that\nagreement and violated state law.  The circuit court recognized that once these predominating\nissues were resolved, the class could be decertified, if necessary, to determine individual\nrestitution and damage issues for class members for breach-of-contract and statutory violations.\nWe hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the\noverarching issue of understaffing is common to the class and may be resolved before\n8\n\nindividual issues of damages must be addressed.  The predominance criterion is satisfied in this\ncase. \nc.  Superiority\nBeverly also contends that the circuit court erred in ruling that a class action is the\nsuperior method to litigate this case.  It maintains that no efficiencies will result from class\ncertification and that there are no barriers to individual lawsuits because the recovery for each\nindividual resident could be substantial, and each resident could be awarded attorneys’ fees and\npunitive damages.3 \nRegarding the superiority requirement, this court has recently said:\nRule 23(b) requires that a class action be superior to other available methods for\nthe fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  This court has held that\nthe  superiority  requirement  is  satisfied  if  class  certification  is  the  more\n“efficient” way of handling the case, and it is fair to both sides.  Where a\ncohesive and manageable class exists, we have held that real efficiency can be\nhad if common, predominating questions of law or fact are first decided, with\ncases then splintering for the trial of individual issues, if necessary.  This court\nhas further stated that when a trial court is determining whether class-action\n3Thomas asserts that Beverly did not raise the arguments to the circuit court that\nrecovery for each class member could be substantial or that class members could receive\npunitive damages. It appears that the issue of substantial recovery was raised in passing in\nBeverly’s brief in opposition to Thomas’s motion for class certification. Though it argued that\nclass members may be able to recover attorneys’ fees in individual suits, it does not appear that\nBeverly ever argued to the circuit court that punitive damages might be awarded. This court\ndoes not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal, see Taylor v. Taylor, __ Ark.\n__, __ S.W.3d __ (Feb. 15, 2007), and will not consider this particular argument in determining\nwhether the superiority requirement was satisfied. \n9\n\nstatus is the superior method for adjudication of a matter, it may be necessary\nfor the trial court to evaluate the manageability of the class.\nAsbury Automotive Group, Inc., 366 Ark. at 611, __ S.W.3d at __ (quoting Van Buren Sch.\nDist., 365 Ark. at 621, __ S.W.3d at __ ).  Further, the “avoidance of a multitude of suits lies\nat the heart of any class action certification.”  American Abstract & Title Co., 358 Ark. at 11,\n186 S.W.3d at 711. \nIn this case, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that a class action is\nthe superior method to resolve the overarching issues common to the class members.  The\ncircuit court found that if Beverly were absolved of liability, the class litigation would end with\n“minimal expenditure of judicial resources.” It further reasoned that without class certification,\nsome of the claims could merely “go away” because many of the claims may involve only\nsmall amounts of damage and many of the class members may not be able to afford the\nlitigation expenses of bringing their claims separately.  It also noted that many of the class\nmembers were elderly, were unaware of their rights, and would not be able to file their claims\nagainst Beverly, if a class was not certified.  The circuit court then explained that Beverly\nwould benefit from the class action by avoiding 489 separate lawsuits addressing the same\nissues. \nA class action is clearly a more efficient way of handling a case where there is a\npredominating, common issue to be resolved for all 489 class members.  A class action is also\nfair to both sides in this case, as it is a vehicle for all class members to have their claims heard,\n10\n\nand Beverly will not have to defend against the same assertion of liability in a multitude of\ndifferent lawsuits.  The most efficient way to handle this case is to certify a class to determine\nthe issue of whether Beverly systematically and chronically understaffed the Batesville nursing\nfacility and then decertify the class, if necessary, to determine individual restitution and damage\nclaims as well as any defenses in separate proceedings.  We hold that the circuit court did not\nabuse its discretion in ruling that a class action is the superior method to resolve this case.\n11\n\nd.  Adequacy\nBeverly contends that Thomas is an inadequate class representative because she has\nsevered her individual claims on behalf of Helen Cook for medical malpractice and negligence\nfrom the class claims and that she has scheduled her individual claims for trial ahead of the\nclass claims.  As a result, Beverly maintains that Thomas has breached her fiduciary duty to\nthe class and that because the individual claims arise out of the same residency as the class\nclaims, res judicata may bar the class claims if not asserted with Thomas’s individual claims.\nThe adequacy criteria under Rule 23 requires that the class representatives “fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.” Ark. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  This court has held that\nthree elements are required under the adequacy criteria:\n(1) the representative counsel must be qualified, experienced and generally able\nto conduct the litigation; (2) that there be no evidence of collusion or conflicting\ninterest between the representative and the class; and (3) the representative must\ndisplay some minimal level of interest in the action, familiarity with the practices\nchallenged, and ability to assist in decision making as to the conduct of the\nlitigation.\nAsbury Automotive Group, Inc., 366 Ark. at 605, __ S.W.3d at __ (quoting American\nAbstract & Title Co., 358 Ark. at 12, 186 S.W.3d at 712). \nThe circuit court found that the adequacy criteria of Rule 23 had been met.  First, it\nfound that the attorneys representing the class have extensive experience in litigating class\nactions and show a high degree of competency.  Secondly, it ruled that Thomas was an\nadequate class representative, as there was no conflict of interest between her and the class she\n12\n\nwishes to represent.  The circuit court stated it was convinced that Thomas would vigorously\npursue the class claims as well as any additional individual claims that were not adverse to the\nclass claims.  It also reasoned that Thomas was familiar with the litigation and demonstrated\na strong desire to serve as class representative.  \nThough Beverly did argue to the circuit court that Thomas was an inadequate class\nrepresentative, it appears never to have raised the specific argument that it makes now\nregarding res judicata and its effect on class claims if Thomas pursues her individual claims\nfirst.  Further, the circuit court did not rule on whether Thomas’s severance of her medical\nmalpractice and negligence claims would bar her ability to bring class claims or whether the\nseverance constituted a breach of her fiduciary duty to the class members.  To reiterate, this\ncourt will not consider arguments not raised before the circuit court and ruled upon.  See\nTaylor, supra.  Accordingly, we will not address this precise point. \nRegarding the adequacy of the class representative in general, this court has said that\nthe “‘adequacy of representation’ element is satisfied if the representative displays a minimal\nlevel of interest in the action, familiarity with the challenged practices, and ability to assist in\nlitigation decisions.”  Asbury Automotive Group, Inc., 366 Ark. at 606, __ S.W.3d at __\n(quoting Direct Gen. Ins. Co. v. Lane 328 Ark. 476, 485, 944 S.W.2d 528, 532 (1997)).\nThomas testified in her deposition that she understood that as the class representative, she\nwould be responsible for speaking for the group and that she would do what she could to make\nsure the class members received restitution damages for breach of contract and for the\n13\n\ndiminished quality of life they endured.  She further testified that she believed that her\nmother’s injuries, which occurred while she was residing in the Batesville nursing facility, were\nthe result of insufficient staff and supplies.  Based on her testimony, there is nothing to suggest\nthat Thomas would not be an adequate class representative. \ne.  Kohn\nWe address, as a final point, Beverly’s reliance  on Kohn v. American Housing\nFoundation, Inc., 178 F.R.D. 536 (D. Colo. 1998), where a federal district court in Colorado\nruled that certification was not warranted for a class of current and former residents of a\nnursing home who filed claims against the nursing home for violations of the Colorado\nConsumer  Protection  Act,  breach  of  a  Medicaid  contract,  and  negligence  based  on\nunderstaffing and environmental problems at the nursing home.  The federal district court ruled\nthat common questions of fact and law did not predominate over individualized issues.  That\ncourt reasoned that class members were individuals who may or may not have been exposed\nto the unlawful conduct and that those who were exposed would not all be harmed in the same\nway. The court recognized that certification based solely on the issue of liability may be\nappropriate in some cases, but not where the class members are surrounded by differing\ncircumstances. \nThe Kohn case, though, is distinguishable from the instant case in that the federal\ndistrict court used a “rigorous analysis” under Federal Rule 23 in determining whether the\n14\n\ncertification criteria had been met.  Kohn, 178 F.R.D. at 539.  This court does not require that\nthe circuit court conduct a “rigorous analysis” under our Rule 23.  Tay-Tay, Inc. v. Young, 349\nArk. 675, 683, 80 S.W.3d 365, 368 (2002).  Furthermore, the plaintiffs in Kohn, supra,\nincluded a negligence claim where a finding of causation for each class member was necessary\nto establish liability.  In the instant case, the circuit court specifically excluded claims for\nmedical malpractice and personal injury. \nThe case of  Fleming v. Barnwell Nursing Home & Health Facilities, Inc., 309 A.D.2d\n1132, 766 N.Y.S.2d 241 (2003), appears more persuasive to this court.  In that case, a New\nYork appellate court held that class certification was not proper for nursing-home residents\nwho sought to file a negligence claim against a nursing home because individual questions\ninvolving causation and injury existed.  However, the court further held that certification was\nwarranted where the class members asserted claims pursuant to New York’s Public Health\nLaw § 2801-d, which allowed private causes of action against a nursing home to recover for\nthe deprivation of certain rights.  The court ruled that common questions regarding the nursing\nhome’s violation of the Public Health Law predominated over individual issues and stated that\n“[t]he predominance requirement may be satisfied even if not all class member were subjected\nto all the improper conduct.”  Fleming, 309 A.D.2d at 1133-34, 766 N.Y.S.2d at 243. \nThe class in the case at hand has been certified only for purposes of bringing statutory\nand contractual claims, not personal-injury claims.  Furthermore, individual damages incurred\nby each class member will only be relevant during the second phase of this litigation, if\n15\n\nnecessary, and not during the liability phase.  We conclude that the circuit court did not err in\ngranting Thomas’s motion for class certification.\nAffirmed.\n16",
