Merin filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, challenging the Sacramento County and Sacramento County Probation Department policy of strip searching juveniles at Sacramento County Juvenile Hall. The Kozlowski case was filed November 5, 2004. The other case, styled, <a href=\"../../../../case/10257/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Robinson, et al. v. Sacramento County</a>, et al. No. CIV.S.04-1617 FCD/PAN was filed on August 10, 2004, Both cases were declared \"related\" and assigned to the Honorable Frank C. Damrell, Jr.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed answers in both cases generally denying all allegations of wrong doing or liability. A new strip search policy was instituted on September 29, 2004, to conform with state and federal law.</p>\r\n<p>After extensive document discovery and depositions, the parties mediated the cases before the Honorable Raul A. Ramirez (retired). The mediation, which lasted four days, spread out over three months, produced a settlement. Under the Stipulation for Settlement, the parties agreed that the settlement class consisted of:</p>\r\n<p>a. All juveniles booked and assigned to a unit at Sacramento County Juvenile Hall and strip searched during the class period (January 1, 1998, through October 1, 2004);</p>\r\n<p>b. The sub-class of juveniles who were booked on misdemeanor, infraction, ordinance violation, or other non-felony offenses not involving violence, drugs or weapons, assigned to a unit and strip searched during the period of their incarceration;</p>\r\n<p>c. The sub-class of all juveniles booked at Sacramento County Juvenile Hall on felony charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons who were assigned to a unit and strip searched during the period of their incarceration.</p>\r\n<p>The County agreed to pay the $4.280 million to settle all class claims. Of that amount, $1.5 million was allocated as attorney's fees and reimbursement costs and expenses; $350,000.00 for the costs of claim administration and $280,000.00 for incentive payments to the representative plaintiffs. The remainder went to pay class claims. The District Court (Judge Frank C. Damrell) preliminarily approved the settlement on August 11, 2006. Following a fairness hearing on March 2, 2007, Judge Damrell entered the final approval order and judgment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

All SCMs who were booked at the Sacramento County Juvenile Hall during the Class\n9 Period, assigned to a Unit, and strip searched during the period of their incarceration, upon return\n10 of a verified Claim Form, shall, for each booking up to a maximum of three bookings, receive one\n11 (1) point for having been assigned to a Unit and, additional points, if applicable, as specified below:\n12 a. Five (5) points shall be assigned to each SCM who returns a verified Claim\n13 Form for each booking which led to assignment to a unit during the Claims\n14 Period if, for that booking, the SCM was charged only with a misdemeanor,\n15 infraction, ordinance violation, or other non-felony offense, not involving\n16 violence, drugs or weapons.  If an SCM, in this category, was on searchable\n17 probation at the time of the booking and assignment to a Unit, the number of\n18 additional points assigned to the SCM shall be two (2) for each such booking.\n19 b. For each booking and assignment to a Unit during the Class Period, an SCM\n20 charged with a felony not involving violence, drugs or weapons shall be\n21 assigned an additional three (3) points.  If the SCM, at the time of such\n22 booking and assignment to a Unit, was on searchable probation at the time,\n23 the SCM will receive one (1) additional point for each such booking and Unit\n24 assignment.\n25 c. Claimants may only receive points for only the first 3 bookings at the\n26 Juvenile Hall.\n27 38.

The Administrator will determine the total possible points which could be obtained\n2 by the class members if all eligible SCMs filed claims.  At the conclusion of the Claims Period, the\n3 total number of points attributed to all SCMs who submit claims will be totaled and if the total\n4 equals or exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total possible points, the amount of money available for\n5 distribution to the Class Members other than Representative Plaintiffs ($4 million dollars) shall be\n6 divided by the total number of points of SCMโs who submit claims to arrive at the value of each\n7 point.  Each SCMโs claim will then be valued by taking the point value and multiply it by the number\n8 of points assigned to that SCMโs claim.  If the total number of points of SCMโs who submit claims\n9 is less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of possible points which could be obtained if all\n10 class members submitted claims, each point shall be valued at Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and\n11 the claims paid as set out below.  Any unclaimed Funds shall be returned to Defendants or their\n12 designee.\n13 40.

Such SCM\n18 shall in all other respects be bound by all of the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, and the\n19 judgment entered herein, including but not limited to the release of all Released Persons of all claims\n20 resolved herein.\n21 42.

Claim Forms of all SCMs who have not attained the age of 18 at the time the Claim\n25 Form is submitted shall be signed by a parent or guardian, or by the minor if the minor does not have\n26 ready access to a parent or guardian at the time the claim form is submitted.  The checks distributed\n27 to the SCMs who have not attained the age of 18 at the time the checks are mailed shall be made out\n28 jointly to the SCM and the parent or guardian, if any, who signs the Claim Form and the parent or\nPage 11\nEMILY ROBINSON, et al. v.

Merin in trust for the SCM and mailed to the Law Office of Mark E. Merin to be held\n5 in trust for that minor until the minor attains the age of eighteen (18) at which time the funds shall\n6 be distributed to the SCM.\n7 VI.\n8 PAYMENT OF DEBTS OWED TO THE COUNTY FROM AWARDS\n9 44. Any award to SCMs shall be subject to any Debts Owed to the County and Court\n10 ordered restitution.  The Defendants shall provide to the Claims Administrator, with a copy to Class\n11 Counsel, a list of all qualified SCMs who have Debts Owed to the County as defined in Paragraph\n12 9 and who submit valid claims, with the amount of the Debt Owed to the County and/or Court\n13 ordered restitution specified.  The Claims Administrator is directed to deduct from each SCMโs\n14 award the amount of the specified Debt Owed to the County, up to a maximum of fifty percent (50%)\n15 of the SCMโs award.  The SCMsโ awards shall be subject to reduction for entire amount of any Court\n16 ordered restitution payments.  The Claims Administrator shall reduce the SCMsโ payments and\n17 forward to Sacramento County the amount of unpaid restitution specified by the Court orders.\n18 Copies of the information related to the restitution and the reduction of claims awards shall be\n19 provided to the SCMs with copies to Class Counsel.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n20 SACRAMENTO COUNTY; SACRAMENTO\nCOUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT;\n21 SACRAMENTO COUNTY CHIEF\nPROBATION OFFICER VERNE\n22 SPEIRS, in his individual and\nofficial capacity; SACRAMENTO\n23 COUNTY ASSISTANT CHIEF\nPROBATION OFFICER SUZANNE\n24 COLLINS, in her individual and\nofficial capacity; and DOES 1\n25 THROUGH 150,\n26 Defendants.\n27 ///\n28 ///\n\n1 ----oo0oo----\n2 This matter is before the court on motion by defendants\n3 Sacramento County (the โCountyโ), Sacramento County Probation\n4 Department (โProbation Departmentโ), Sacramento County Chief\n5 Probation Officer Verne Speirs (โSpeirsโ), and Sacramento County\n6 Assistant Chief Probation Officer Suzanne Collins (โCollinsโ),\n7 for dismissal, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n8 12(b)(6).  For the reasons stated below, defendantsโ motion is\n9 DENIED in part and GRANTED in part.1\n10 BACKGROUND\n11 Plaintiffs Kimberly Kozlowski (โKozlowskiโ), Jasmine Taggart\n12 (โTaggartโ), and Alicia Anderson (โAndersonโ) bring this action\n13 on behalf of themselves and all those similarly situated against\n14 defendants, asserting violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth\n15 Amendments pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.2  (Pls.โ First Amended\n16 Complaint (โCompl.โ), filed Nov. 30, 2004, at 2:14-17.)  In\n17 addition, plaintiffs assert claims under the Unruh Civil Rights\n18 Act (Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.1(b)) and California Penal Code ยง 4030.\n19 (Compl. at 2:18-25.) \n20 Each of the plaintiffs, at one point in time, has been held\n21 at Sacramento Countyโs B.T. Collins Juvenile Detention Center\n22 (โJuvenile Hallโ).  In or about 1997, and again on December 31,\n23 2002, Kozlowski was arrested for misdemeanor offenses and \n24 transported to the Juvenile Hall.  (Compl. at 5:19-23.) \n25\n1 Because oral argument will not be of material\n26 assistance, the court orders the matter submitted on the briefs. \nSee E.D. Cal. L.R. 78-230(h).\n27\n2 Hereinafter all references to โSection 1983\" are to\n28 Title 42 of the United States Code.\n2\n\n1 Kozlowski alleges that prior to a detention hearing she was\n2 subjected to visual body cavity searches.  (Id.)  On or about\n3 April 27, 2004, Taggart was arrested for misdemeanor offenses and\n4 was transported to the Juvenile Hall.  (Compl. at 6:3-8.)  At the\n5 Juvenile Hall, Taggart claims to have been subjected to visual\n6 body cavity searches.  (Id.)  On or about August 7, 2004,\n7 Anderson was arrested and transported to the Juvenile Hall. \n8 (Compl. at 6:19-24.)  Anderson claims to have been subjected to\n9 visual body cavity searches.  (Id.)  These allegations form the\n10 basis of plaintiffsโ claims against each of the defendants.  \n11 At all relevant times, Speirs and Collins were the\n12 Sacramento County Chief Probation Officer and the Sacramento\n13 County Assistant Chief Probation Officer, respectively.  (Id. at\n14 3:28-4:10.)  Defendants claim they are immune from liability\n15 under the Eleventh Amendment on the ground that in Sacramento\n16 County, the Chief Probation Officer acts on behalf of the state\n17 rather than the county when administering the intake function at\n18 the Juvenile Hall.  (Defs.โ Mot. to Dismiss, (โDefs.โ Mot.โ),\n19 filed January 11, 2005, at 6:28-7:4.)  In addition, defendants\n20 ask the court to dismiss plaintiffsโ state law claims due to\n21 various immunities contained in the California Government Code. \n22 (Defs.โ Mot. at 9:1-12.)  Plaintiffs claim that Speirs is\n23 responsible for making, overseeing, and implementing the policies\n24 challenged in this case relating to the operation of the Juvenile\n25 Hall on behalf of Sacramento County. (Compl. at 3:28-4:4.) \n26 Plaintiffs assert that Collins is responsible for assisting in\n27 the administration of these policies at the Juvenile Hall on\n28 behalf of Sacramento County.  (Id. at 4:5-10.)\n3\n\n1 STANDARD\n2 On a motion to dismiss, the allegations of the complaint\n3 must be accepted as true.  Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322\n4 (1972).  The court is bound to give plaintiffs the benefit of\n5 every reasonable inference to be drawn from the โwell-pleadedโ\n6 allegations of the complaint.  Retail Clerks Int'l Ass'n v.\n7 Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746, 753 n.6 (1963).  Thus, the plaintiff\n8 need not necessarily plead a particular fact if that fact is a\n9 reasonable inference from facts properly alleged.  See id.  \n10 Given that the complaint is construed favorably to the\n11 pleader, the court may not dismiss the complaint for failure to\n12 state a claim unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff\n13 can prove no set of facts in support of the claim which would\n14 entitle him or her to relief.  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45\n15 (1957); NL Industries, Inc. v. Kaplan, 792 F.2d 896, 898 (9th\n16 Cir. 1986).\n17 Nevertheless, it is inappropriate to assume that plaintiffs\n18 โcan prove facts which it has not alleged or that the defendants\n19 have violated the . . . laws in ways that have not been alleged.โ \n20 Associated Gen. Contractors of Calif., Inc. v. Calif. State\n21 Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526 (1983).  Moreover, the\n22 court โneed not assume the truth of legal conclusions cast in the\n23 form of factual allegations.โ  United States ex rel. Chunie v.\n24 Ringrose, 788 F.2d 638, 643 n.2 (9th Cir. 1986).\n25 In ruling upon a motion to dismiss, the court may consider\n26 only the complaint, any exhibits thereto, and matters which may\n27 be judicially noticed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201. \n28 See Mir v. Little Co. Of Mary Hospital, 844 F.2d 646, 649 (9th\n4\n\n1 Cir. 1988); Isuzu Motors Ltd. v. Consumers Union of United\n2 States, Inc., 12 F.Supp.2d 1035, 1042 (C.D. Cal. 1998).\n3 ANALYSIS\n4 I. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n5 In a related case, Robinson, et al. v. Sacramento County, et\n6 al., Civ. S-04-1617 FCD PAN (hereinafter Robinson), pending\n7 before this court, a different set of plaintiffs brought\n8 identical claims against the same defendants in this case.  In a\n9 previously filed motion to dismiss in Robinson, defendants\n10 claimed they were immune from Section 1983 liability under the\n11 Eleventh Amendment on the ground that in Sacramento County, the\n12 Chief and Assistant Probation Officer act on behalf of the State\n13 rather than the County when administering the intake function at\n14 the Juvenile Hall.  After reviewing Californiaโs constitutional,\n15 statutory, and regulatory scheme, as well as California case law,\n16 this court rejected defendantsโ arguments.  (Robinson, Mem. &\n17 Order, filed Feb. 4, 2005.)  The court found that the challenged\n18 policies were administrative in nature and were performed on\n19 behalf of the County, not on behalf of the State.  (Id.)  In the\n20 instant motion to dismiss, defendants raise the exact arguments\n21 they raised in Robinson.  Thus, for the reasons stated in\n22 Robinson, Speirsโ and Collinsโ motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ\n23 claims brought under Section 1983 is DENIED.  In addition,\n24 Sacramento Countyโs motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ claims brought\n25 under Section 1983 is DENIED.  (Id. at 6-16.)\n26 Unlike the motion to dismiss brought in Robinson, defendants\n27 now assert that Sacramento County Probation Department is an\n28 improper party to a civil action brought under Section 1983. \n5\n\n1 (Defs.โ Mot. at 8:4-10.)  Plaintiffs do not respond to this\n2 argument.  The court finds that the County is a proper defendant\n3 in a Section 1983 claim, but an agency of the County is not.  See\n4 Vance v. County of Santa Clara, 928 F. Supp. 993, 996 (C.D. Cal.\n5 1996) (finding that the Department of Corrections of Santa Clara\n6 County was an improper party to a Section 1983 claim because\n7 municipal departments are not โpersonsโ under the statute.) \n8 Thus, Sacramento County Probation Departmentโs motion to dismiss\n9 plaintiffsโ claims brought under Section 1983 is GRANTED.      \n10 II. State Law Claims\n11 Plaintiffs bring two state law claims against defendants. \n12 In Count Two, plaintiffs allege that defendants violated Section\n13 52.1 of the California Civil Code by requiring plaintiffs to\n14 submit to pre-detention hearing visual body cavity searches. \n15 (Compl. at ยถยถ 46-49.)  Plaintiffs further allege in Count Three\n16 that defendants violated Section 4030 of the California Penal\n17 Code by requiring plaintiffs to submit to pre-detention hearing\n18 visual body cavity searches.  (Compl. at ยถยถ 51-52.)  Defendants\n19 ask the court to dismiss these state law claims due to various\n20 immunities contained in the California Government Code.  The\n21 court addresses each of these arguments in turn.3  \n22\n23     \n24\n3 In a factually similar case, the United States District\n25 Court for the Northern District of California (Jenkins, J.)\nevaluated similar immunity claims put forth by a defendant faced\n26 with similar state law claims as we have here.  (See Order\nGranting in Part and Denying in Part Defs.โ Mot. To Dismiss,\n27 Chatoian v. County of Marin, Civ. 04-2790 MJJ, filed December 14,\n2004, N.D. Cal.)  The Chatoian courtโs reasoning is well-crafted\n28 and particularly relevant to this case.\n6\n\n1 A. Plaintiff Kozlowskiโs State Law Claims\n2 Defendants assert that plaintiff Kozlowskiโs state law\n3 claims must be dismissed due to Kozlowskiโs failure to comply\n4 with the claim presentation requirements of the California Tort\n5 Claims Act.4  (Defs.โ Mot. at 13:2-12.)  In opposition,\n6 plaintiffs โconcede that plaintiff Kozlowski will not be able to\n7 remedy this pleading deficiency....โ  (Pls.โ Oppโn to Defs.โ Mot.\n8 to Dismiss (โPls.โ Oppโnโ), filed February 11, 2005, at 19:11-\n9 14.)  Accordingly, defendantsโ motion to dismiss plaintiff\n10 Kozlowskiโs state law claims is GRANTED.\n11 B. Immunity Under the California Tort Claims Act\n12 Defendants move for dismissal of the remaining plaintiffsโ\n13 state law claims on the grounds that the County, Probation\n14 Department, Speirs, and Collins are entitled to immunity under\n15 various provisions of the California Government Code.5 \n16 Defendants argue that the County and the Probation Department are\n17 immune under Section 844.6 and Section 815.2(b).  In addition,\n18 defendants argue that Speirs and Collins are entitled to\n19 discretionary immunity under Section 820.2 or, alternatively,\n20 Speirs and Collins are entitled to immunity under Section 802.8. \n21 Initially, the court notes that these immunity provisions do not\n22 apply to claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Rodriguez\n23 v. Cal. Highway Patrol, 89 F. Supp. 2d 1131, 1138 (N.D. Cal.\n24 2000) (citing CAL. GOVโT CODE ยง 814).  The immunity provisions\n25\n26 4 CAL. GOVโT CODE ยง 900 et seq.\n27 5 All references hereafter to the โCodeโ or to a specific\nโSectionโ are to the California Government Code unless specified\n28 otherwise.  \n7\n\n1 cited by defendants apply only to claims for damages.  Id.  In\n2 this case, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, and\n3 money damages.  (Compl. at 1:27-28 to 2:1-13.)  Thus, the state\n4 law claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against\n5 defendants remain intact.  Before turning to each of defendantsโ\n6 claims of immunity, the court notes that the California Supreme\n7 Court has instructed that \"in governmental tort cases, the rule\n8 is liability, immunity is the exception.โ  Lopez v. Southern Cal.\n9 Rapid Transit Dist., 40 Cal.3d 780 (1985) (internal quotation\n10 marks and citations omitted).    \n11 1. Sacramento Countyโs and the Probation Departmentโs\nImmunity Under Section 844.6\n12\n13 Section 844.6 of the California Government Code provides\n14 that a public entity is not liable for injury to a prisoner\n15 โexcept as provided in this section and in Sections 814, 814.2,\n16 845.4 and 845.6, or in Title 2.1 (commencing with Section 3500)\n17 or part 3 of the Penal Code.โ  CAL. GOVโT CODE ยง 844.6.  There is\n18 no question that those exceptions do not apply here. \n19 Notwithstanding the lack of an applicable, specific exception,\n20 the court must determine whether Section 844.6 immunizes the\n21 County and the Probation Department from liability for claims\n22 made pursuant to California Penal Code section 4030 and\n23 California Civil Code section 52.1.\n24 The court is guided by the expressio unius est exclusio\n25 alterius canon of statutory interpretation.  Clearly, Section\n26 844.6 sets forth specific exceptions to a government entityโs\n27 immunity and does not enumerate Penal Code section 4030 or Civil\n28 Code section 52.1 among those exceptions.  The legislatureโs\n8\n\n1 expression of certain exceptions suggests that omitting others\n2 was intentional and that a government entity is immune from\n3 liability for plaintiffsโ Penal Code section 4030 and Civil Code\n4 section 52.1 claims.  Moreover, where governmental tort liability\n5 immunity exists it is only withdrawn โby a clear indication of\n6 legislative intent that statutory immunity is withheld or\n7 withdrawn in the particular case.โ  Caldwell v. Montoya, 10 Cal.\n8 4th 972, 986 (1995) (italics omitted).  There is nothing in Penal\n9 Code section 4030 which indicates that the legislature intended\n10 to withdraw immunity as to government entities sued pursuant to\n11 that statute.  Similarly, nothing in Civil Code section 52.1\n12 indicates that statutory immunity is to be withheld or withdrawn. \n13 Accord Chatoian v. County of Marin, Civ. 04-2790 MJJ at 20:20-25\n14 to 21:1-9.   \n15 Plaintiffs argue that Section 844.6 immunity does not apply\n16 to their state law claims because plaintiffs were not โprisonersโ\n17 at the time of the alleged injury.  (Pls.โ Reply at 15:4-8.)  The\n18 term โprisonerโ as used in Section 844.6 is defined in California\n19 Government Code section 844.  Section 844 provides, in pertinent\n20 part, โโprisonerโ includes an inmate of a prison, jail, or penal\n21 or correctional facility.โ  The Legislative Committee Comment to\n22 section 844.6 states, โ[t]he immunity provided to public entities\n23 by this section prevails over all other provisions of the\n24 statute.  Thus, the public entity is immune from liability for\n25 injuries to prisoners (which includes wards of the juvenile\n26 court).โ  Jiminez v. County of Santa Cruz, 42 Cal. App. 3d 407,\n27 409 (1974).  Clearly, a ward of the juvenile court is a\n28 โprisonerโ in terms of governmental tort immunity under Section\n9\n\n1 844.6.  \n2 Plaintiffs contend that they had not yet appeared before a\n3 judicial officer when the alleged strip search took place and, as\n4 such, they cannot be classified as โwards of the juvenile court.โ \n5 However, Section 844.6 has been held to apply to juveniles who\n6 are confined in a juvenile facility.  Jiminez, 42 Cal. App. 3d at\n7 413.  While the court is bound to give plaintiffs the benefit of\n8 every reasonable inference to be drawn from the allegations of\n9 the complaint, plaintiffs allege in their own complaint that the\n10 alleged strip searches took place while each plaintiff was in\n11 custody at the Juvenile Hall.  The court finds that, by\n12 plaintiffsโ own admission, plaintiffs were confined in a juvenile\n13 facility at the time of the alleged injury and, as such,\n14 plaintiffs are โprisonersโ under Section 844.6.       \n15 Thus, defendantsโ motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ claims\n16 against Sacramento County and Sacramento County Probation\n17 Department for violations of California Penal Code section 4030\n18 and Civil Code section 52.1 for damages is GRANTED.  Defendantsโ\n19 motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ Section 4030 and Section 52.1\n20 claims against Sacramento County and Sacramento County Probation\n21 Department for declaratory and injunctive relief is DENIED.       \n22 2. Speirsโ and Collinsโ Immunity Under Section 820.2\n23 California Government Code section 820.2 provides, in\n24 pertinent part, that โa public employee is not liable for an\n25 injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or\n26 omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested\n27 in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.โ  Defendants\n28 argue that Speirs and Collins are entitled to immunity under this\n10\n\n1 statute because โthe alleged actions are the result of the\n2 exercise of the discretion vested in them by the nature of their\n3 respective positions in โpromulgatingโ policies.โ  (Defs.โ Mot.\n4 at 11:25-27.)  The court finds that the alleged policy enacted\n5 and implemented by Speirs and Collins regarding strip search\n6 procedures at the Juvenile Hall constitutes a discretionary act\n7 within the meaning of Section 820.2.  See, e.g., Johnson v. State\n8 of California, 69 Cal.2d 782, 793 (1968) (discretionary actions\n9 are those involving basic policy decisions).  Plaintiffs do not\n10 oppose this finding.  Rather, plaintiffs argue that Section 820.2\n11 does not apply to the statutes under which plaintiffs bring their\n12 state law claims.  Specifically, plaintiffs argue that to find\n13 that Section 820.2 immunized Speirs and Collins would effectively\n14 emasculate Penal Code section 4030 and Civil Code section 52.1. \n15 (Pls.โ Oppโn at 17:13-18.)\n16 The California Supreme Court has held that the discretionary\n17 immunity set forth in Section 820.2 โcannot be abrogated by a\n18 statute which simply imposes a general duty or liability on\n19 persons including public employees.โ  Caldwell, 10 Cal. 4th at\n20 986.  As discussed earlier, immunity is withdrawn only โby a\n21 clear indication of legislative intent that statutory immunity is\n22 withheld or withdrawn in the particular case.โ  Id. (italics\n23 omitted).  \n24 In Caldwell, the court held that under Section 820.2, a\n25 school board was immune from Californiaโs Fair Housing and\n26 Employment Act (โFEHAโ) liability for its refusal to renew a\n27 superintendentโs contract.  Id. at 989.  The court found that the\n28 decision by the members of the school board as to whether to\n11\n\n1 renew the contract was a basic policy decision, โand thus a\n2 discretionary act of the kind for which public employees are\n3 entitled to personal immunity under section 820.2 of the Tort\n4 Claims Act.โ  Id.  The court reasoned that FEHA, which created a\n5 general statutory duty and liability for violation of its\n6 provisions, did not abrogate Section 820.2 immunity because it\n7 did not expressly withdraw immunity.  Id.  \n8 The issue to determine here, as in Caldwell, is whether\n9 California Penal Code section 4030 and/or California Civil Code\n10 section 52.1 contain an express legislative intent to withdraw\n11 discretionary immunity under Section 820.2.6  The court addresses\n12 each of these statutes in turn.              \n13 a. No Immunity From Penal Code Section 4030\nLiability\n14\n15 California Penal Code section 4030 was expressly enacted โto\n16 protect the state and federal constitutional rights of the people\n17 of California by establishing a statewide policy strictly\n18 limiting strip and body cavity searches.โ  CAL. PENAL CODE ยง\n19 4030(a).  The Legislature found โthat law enforcement policies\n20 and practices for conducting strip or body cavity searches of\n21 detained persons vary widely throughout California.โ  Id. \n22 Subsection (b) declares that the statute applies โto any minor\n23 detained prior to a detention hearing on the grounds that he or\n24 she is a person described in Section 300, 601, or 602 of the\n25\n26 6 In Chatoian, the court found that California Penal Code\nsection 4030 and California Civil Code section 52.1 did express\n27 the legislatureโs intent to withdraw otherwise applicable\nimmunity under the California Tort Claims Act.  Chatoian, Civ.\n28 04-2790 MJJ at 18:6-23, 19:6-11.\n12\n\n1 Welfare and Institutions Code alleged to have committed a\n2 misdemeanor or infraction offense.โ  CAL. PENAL CODE ยง 4030(b). \n3 According to the statute, it is a misdemeanor to โknowingly and\n4 willfully authorize[] or conduct[] a body cavity search in\n5 violation of this section.โ  CAL. PENAL CODE ยง 4030(n).  Subsection\n6 (p) affords a person so searched statutory civil remedies\n7 including recovery of actual damages.  CAL. PENAL CODE ยง 4030(p).  \n8 Defendants argue that the language of Section 4030 does not\n9 contain an express withdrawal of immunity as required by\n10 Caldwell.  Moreover, defendants argue that the sanctions imposed\n11 by Section 4030 โare imposed only against an individual who\n12 conducts the ministerial act of โauthorizing or conductingโ strip\n13 searches, not on a person who performs the discretionary function\n14 of setting policy.โ7  (Defs.โ Reply to Pls.โ Oppโn to Mot. to\n15 Dismiss (โDefs.โ Replyโ), filed February 18, 2005, at 12:8-12.) \n16 Defendantsโ position is unpersuasive.  The statute imposes a\n17 legal duty to abstain from engaging in or authorizing such\n18 searches, and the statute provides express civil remedies when\n19 its provisions are violated.  \n20 The court is thus left with defendantsโ argument that in\n21 passing Penal Code section 4030 โthe Legislature did not express\n22 a specific intent to hold state officials personally accountable\n23\n24 7 The court finds defendantsโ argument inconsistent. \nSpeirs and Collins claim discretionary immunity from liability\n25 under California Penal Code section 4030 and simultaneously\ncontend that this same section only imposes liability for\n26 ministerial conduct.  The statute creates liability for conduct\nthat can be described as discretionary (i.e., โauthorize a strip\n27 searchโ) or ministerial (i.e., โconduct a strip searchโ).  The\nplain language of the statute demands that the court reject\n28 defendantsโ argument.\n13\n\n1 for violations of Penal Code Section 4030,โ (Defs.โ Reply at\n2 12:16-17), and as such, Speirs and Collins are entitled to\n3 immunity under Section 820.2.  Plaintiffs urge, to the contrary,\n4 that the court should find that Section 820.2 is overridden by\n5 Penal Code section 4030 because Section 4030 is โa narrowly drawn\n6 statute aimed to prohibit specific government conduct and\n7 provides redress to those harmed by the violation.โ  (Pls.โ Oppโn\n8 at 14:22-23.)  Plaintiffs argue to find that Speirs and Collins,\n9 who are alleged to have enacted, overseen, and implemented the\n10 policies and procedures at issue in this lawsuit, immune from\n11 Section 4030 liability would render Section 4030 a nullity.  The\n12 court agrees.\n13 Plaintiffs correctly argue that this case is more like\n14 Shoemaker v. Myers, 2 Cal. App. 4th 1407 (1992) and Southern\n15 California Rapid Transit Dist. v. Superior Court, 30 Cal. App.\n16 4th 713 (1994), than like Caldwell.  In Shoemaker, a California\n17 appellate court found Government Code section 19683, a whistle-\n18 blowing statute, to abrogate governmental tort liability.  The\n19 court reasoned that the whistle-blower statute was directed\n20 chiefly against state employees who otherwise would be protected\n21 by the immunity statute.  Shoemaker, 2 Cal. App. 4th at 1424-25.\n22 Thus, the court found that conferring immunity on a public\n23 employee violating the whistle-blower statute would render the\n24 protection afforded by the whistle-blower statute illusory.  Id. \n25 The court went on to hold that to grant governmental tort\n26 immunity to a party violating the whistle-blower statute would be\n27 โtotally inconsistent with the design of section 19683.โ  Id. at\n28 1425.\n14\n\n1 In Caldwell, on the other hand, the California Supreme Court\n2 considered the analysis in Shoemaker and determined that the\n3 statute at issue, FEHA, unlike Section 19638, did not abrogate\n4 governmental tort immunity under the California Tort Claims Act. \n5 Caldwell, 10 Cal. 4th at 972.  The court held that while Section\n6 19683's โspecific nature and purpose  . . .  provide[s] a โclear\n7 indication of  . . .  intentโ [such that] the personal immunities\n8 of public employees are abrogated,โ by contrast, โFEHA promotes\n9 much more general policies throughout the public and private\n10 sectors and advances no specifically governmental interest that\n11 would support a finding of intent to abrogate any immunity of\n12 public employees.โ  Id. at 986 n.7 (emphasis in original).\n13 The statute at issue in this case is analogous to the one at\n14 issue in Shoemaker.  Penal Code section 4030, like Government\n15 Code section 19638, is โdirected chiefly, if not exclusively,\n16 against state employees otherwise protected by [CTCA] immunity,โ\n17 rather than at private actors.  Shoemaker, 2 Cal. App. 4th at\n18 1425.  The text of Penal Code section 4030 indicates that the\n19 legislatureโs intent was that the statute was to apply to law\n20 enforcement policies and procedures with respect to pre-\n21 arraignment detainees.8  Whereas the statute at issue in\n22 Caldwell, FEHA, is directed at both public and private\n23\n8 โThe Legislature finds and declares that law\n24 enforcement policies and practices for conducting strip or body\ncavity searches of detained persons vary widely throughout\n25 California. Consequently, some people have been arbitrarily\nsubjected to unnecessary strip and body cavity searches after\n26 arrests for minor misdemeanor and infraction offenses. Some\npresent search practices violate state and federal constitutional\n27 rights to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches and\nseizures.โ  CAL. PENAL CODE ยง 4030(a).\n28\n15\n\n1 discrimination, Penal Code section 4030 is not aimed at the\n2 conduct of private citizens.  Penal Code section 4030 can only be\n3 understood as an effort by the legislature to streamline the\n4 strip-searching policies of public law enforcement officials. \n5 See CAL. PENAL CODE ยง 4030(a)-(b).  Defendants cannot contest the\n6 fact that the statute only applies to government employees. \n7 Moreover, like Government Code section 19683, subsection (p) of\n8 Section 4030 creates direct civil liability for violations of the\n9 statute.  Therefore, the court finds that, similar to the statute\n10 at issue in Shoemaker, Penal Code section 4030 expresses the\n11 legislatureโs intent to withdraw otherwise applicable immunity\n12 under Section 820.2.  To hold otherwise would frustrate the\n13 legislatureโs expressly stated purpose and would render Penal\n14 Code section 4030 a nullity.  Thus, the court finds that Section\n15 820.2 does not immunize Speirs and Collins from liability on\n16 plaintiffsโ Section 4030 claim for damages.  Defendantsโ motion\n17 to dismiss plaintiffsโ Penal Code section 4030 claim against\n18 Speirs and Collins is DENIED.\n19 b. No Immunity From Civil Code Section 52.1\nLiability\n20\n21 California Civil Code section 52.1 contains a liability\n22 provision that has been interpreted as an express intention to\n23 withdraw immunity.  See Doe v. Petaluma City Sch. Dist., 830 F.\n24 Supp. 1560 (N.D. Cal. 1993).  In Doe, the court found that\n25 governmental tort โimmunity is not available for a violation of\n26 Civil Code ยง 52.1 since ... section 52.1 specifically provides\n27 liability for individuals โwhether or not acting under color of\n28 law.โโ  Doe, 830 F. Supp. at 1582.  Thus, defendantsโ motion to\n16\n\n1 dismiss plaintiffsโ claim brought against Speirs and Collins\n2 under Section 52.1 is DENIED. \n3 3. Speirsโ and Collinsโ Immunity Under Section 820.8\n4 California Government Code section 820.8 provides, in\n5 pertinent part, โ[A] public employee is not liable for an injury\n6 caused by the act or omission of another person.  Nothing in this\n7 section exonerates a public employee from liability for injury\n8 proximately caused by his own negligent or wrongful act or\n9 omission.โ  Defendants argue that plaintiffsโ failure to allege\n10 that Speirs and Collins personally conducted any of the alleged\n11 strip searches necessarily means that Speirs and Collins must be\n12 immune under Section 820.8.  (Defs.โ Mot. at 12:9-18.)  However,\n13 plaintiffs do not allege that Speirs and Collins are liable for\n14 personally strip searching plaintiffs.  Rather, plaintiffs allege\n15 that Speirs and Collins are liable for โโmaking, implementing,\n16 and overseeingโ the illegal strip search procedures, practices,\n17 and customs which caused plaintiffsโ injuries.โ  (Pls.โ Oppโn at\n18 18:1-3.)  Defendantsโ Section 820.8 immunity argument is without\n19 merit.  The court DENIES defendantsโ motion based upon immunity\n20 under Section 820.8.\n21 4. Sacramento Countyโs and the Probation Departmentโs\nImmunity Under Section 815.2(b)\n22\n23 California Government Code section 815.2(b) provides, in\n24 pertinent part, that โa public entity is not liable for an injury\n25 resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public\n26 entity where the employee is immune from liability.โ  Defendants\n27 argue that to the extent that Speirs and Collins are entitled to\n28 immunity pursuant to the Government Code, the County and the\n17\n\n1 Probation Department are entitled to immunity from those same\n2 state law claims under Section 815.2(b).  Given that Speirs and\n3 Collins are not entitled to immunity, as discussed above,\n4 defendantsโ motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ state law claims\n5 against the County and the Probation Department under Section\n6 815.2(b) is DENIED.\n7 C. Class Actions Under California Civil Code Section 52.1\n8 Defendants contend that the class action portion of Count\n9 Two is barred as a matter of law due to the language of Civil\n10 Code section 52.1.  (Defs.โ Mot. at 13:14-22.)  Civil Code\n11 section 52.1(b) provides, in pertinent part, \n12 Any individual whose exercise or enjoyment of\nrights secured by the Constitution or laws of\n13 the United States, or of rights secured by\nthe Constitution or laws of this state, has\n14 been interfered with, or attempted to be\ninterfered with, as described in subdivision\n15 (a), may institute and prosecute in his or\nher own name and on his or her own behalf a\n16 civil action for damages, including, but not\nlimited to, damages under Section 52...\n17\n18 The court is unaware of, and the parties have failed to\n19 direct the court to, any authority on-point as to the propriety\n20 of class actions brought under Civil Code section 52.1.  However,\n21 a plain reading of the statutory language indicates that class\n22 actions are not permitted under Civil Code section 52.1.  When\n23 the language of a statute is clear, the court need not go any\n24 further to interpret the statuteโs meaning.  People v. Flores, 30\n25 Cal. 4th 1059 (2003) (โThe rules governing statutory construction\n26 are well settled.  When the language of the statute is clear, we\n27 need go no further.โ)\n28\n18\n\n1 Here, the statute requires that a plaintiff bring a cause of\n2 action under this statute โin his or her own name and on his or\n3 her own behalf.โ  Additionally, subsection (a) of the statute\n4 allows โthe Attorney General, or any district attorney or city\n5 attorneyโ to โbring a civil action for injunctive and other\n6 appropriate equitable relief in the name of the people of the\n7 State of California.โ  The legislature obviously intended that\n8 representative claims be brought under subsection (a) of the\n9 statute and individual claims under subsection (b) of the\n10 statute.9  Thus, defendantsโ motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ class\n11 action claim brought in Count Two under California Civil Code \n12 ยง 52.1 is GRANTED.   \n13 CONCLUSION\n14 For the foregoing reasons, defendantsโ motion to dismiss is\n15 decided in the following manner: (1) Speirsโ and Collinsโ motion\n16 to dismiss plaintiffsโ claims brought under Section 1983 is\n17 DENIED; (2) Sacramento Countyโs motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ\n18 claims brought under Section 1983 is DENIED; (3) Sacramento\n19 County Probation Departmentโs motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ\n20 claims brought under Section 1983 is GRANTED; (4) defendantsโ\n21 motion to dismiss plaintiff Kozlowskiโs state law claims is\n22 GRANTED; (5) defendantsโ motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ state law\n23 claims for damages against Sacramento County and Sacramento\n24 County Probation Department is GRANTED; (6) defendantsโ motion to\n25 dismiss plaintiffsโ state law claims for declaratory and\n26\n9 This conclusion is further supported by subsection (a) \n27 which allows an individual who does not bring an action in her\nown name to receive money damages from a judgment prosecuted by\n28 the Attorney General, district attorney, or city attorney. \n19\n\n1 injunctive relief against Sacramento County and Sacramento County\n2 Probation Department is DENIED; (7) defendantsโ motion to dismiss\n3 plaintiffsโ state law claims against Speirs and Collins is\n4 DENIED; and (8) defendantsโ motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ class\n5 action claim brought in Count Two under California Civil Code \n6 ยง 52.1 is GRANTED.     \n7 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n8 DATED: March 11, 2005.\n9 /s/ Frank C.

On August 11, 2006, this Court entered its order preliminarily approving settlement\n6 of the above-captioned consolidated class action.  Since the entry of the Courtโs Preliminary Order,\n7 in accordance with the Stipulation of Settlem ent as proved to the sat isfaction of the Court, the\n8 requisite notice of the Settlement, with opt-out and objection information, was published in the\n9 Sacramento Bee on September 11, 21, and 24, 2006, in the  Sacramento News and Review on\n10 September 14, 21, and 28, 2006, and in the Comic Press News on October 20, 2006.  The notice of\n11 the Settlement and approved claim forms, were posted by First Class Mail to the last-known address\n12 of each person in the Settlement Class.  Both the published notice and the mailed notice specified\n13 that Claim Forms had to be delivered to the Clami s Administrator, postmarked no later than January\n14 8, 2007. \n15 2.  Both the published and mailed notices specified that any person who chose to object\n16 to the Settlement, either personally or through counsel, and desired to appear at the Fairness\n17 Hearing, was required to submit a Notice of Intention to appear, together with written arguments in\n18 support of any objection, by February 16, 2007.  Now  ritten objections were received by the Court.\n19 Furthermore, although opportunity was given by the Cour t to voice objections at the time of the\n20 Fairness Hearing, no objections were stated by any member of the Class or representative of any\n21 such Class Member.\n22 3.
