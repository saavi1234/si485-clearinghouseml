    "summary": "<p>On  August 1, 1997, attorneys from the ACLU of Northern California filed a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf the family of Vang Her, alleging police misconduct by Yuba County Sheriff's deputies. The Her family are Hmong, originally from Southeast Asia.</p><p>Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that in the course of an investigation of a neighbor's complaint that Her's three-year old child fired a BB gun, Yuba County deputies subjected the family to unconstitutional searches and seizures, denied their requests for a translator, detained the entire family, which included seven children, at the Sheriff's station and interrogated Hers' 10-year-old daughter in a police cruiser without parental consent.  The complaint further alleged that in a subsequent incident, Sheriff's deputies appeared at the Her residence without warrants and rounded up the adult occupants for detention and transportation to the station.  Plaintiffs also alleged that deputies went to the Her children's elementary schools and removed three Her children from class without the knowledge or consent of their parents.  Deputies never located a BB gun and criminal charges were not lodged against anyone in the Her family.</p><p>On February 26, 1999, district court Chief Judge William B. Shubb granted defendants' motion for summary judgment in part and denied it in part.  Claims against certain individual defendants were dismissed.  </p><p>Thereafter, the parties reached a settlement of the case.  On October 6, 1999, the court entered a consent judgment, which included the agreement that Yuba County adopt and enforce all General Orders drafted and modified by counsel for the parties, including new general orders pertaining to hate crimes, search and seizure, and detention of juveniles and that the County complete the translation of certain Yuba County Sheriff's Department written materials into the Hmong, Spanish, and Punjabi languages.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "ACLU Page 1of 2\n \nURL: http://www.aclu.org/police/abuse/14545prs19991004.html\n \nACLU Announces Settlement in Hmong Family's Lawsuit Against Yuba County Sheriff's \nDept. (10/4/1999) \n \nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \nSACRAMENTO -- The settlement of a 1997 police misconduct lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties \nUnion of Northern California and others on behalf of Yuba County family has resulted in new policies aimed at \npreventing future abuses by local authorities, the ACLU said today.  \nThe federal lawsuit was filed in August 1997 by the family of Vang Her, alleging a series of acts of police \nmisconduct by Yuba County Sheriff's deputies while responding to a neighbor's claim that the Her's three-\nyear-old toddler had fired a B.B. gun. The Her family, like many in the community, are Hmong, originally from \nSoutheast Asia.  \nAccording to the lawsuit, between August and September 1996, the deputies subjected the family to unlawful \nsearches, at one point detaining the family -- including seven small children -- at the Sheriff's station.  \nThe suit also charged that deputies interrogated the Hers' 10-year-old daughter in a Sheriff's Department \nvehicle without her parents' consent and that the Her children were seized from their elementary school \nclasses without their parents' knowledge or consent.  \nThe incidents occurred and the lawsuit was filed during the tenure of the prior Yuba County Sheriff, Gary \nTindel. The settlement was agreed to by the current Sheriff, Virginia Black, who was elected in June 1998 and \ntook office in January 1999.  \nThe consent decree, the related settlement agreement and policy changes were negotiated by the ACLU and \nprivate attorneys on behalf of the Her family.  \n\"This package of reforms should help prevent future police misconduct and also help in the effort to ensure a \nstrong working relationship between the Hmong community and the Sheriff's Department,\" said ACLU attorney \nJohn Crew, who along with Mark Merin of Dickstein & Merin, are co-counsel for the Her family.  \nThe settlement package includes:  \n(cid:122) A new department Search and Seizure General Order aimed at guarding against abuses of Fourth \nAmendment rights in private homes;  \n \n(cid:122) A new Hate Crimes General Order to ensure that criminal acts of ethnic and racial hatred will be \nproperly identified and thoroughly investigated;  \n \n(cid:122) A new Temporary Custody of Juveniles General Order spelling out how children should be treated by \ndeputies and ensuring the protection of parental rights if students are questioned by deputies while in \nschool;  \n \n(cid:122) A strengthened Personnel Complaint Procedure General Order to improve the department's handling of \nallegations of misconduct;  \n \n(cid:122) The translation into Hmong, Spanish and Punjabi languages of key forms and materials on the \ncomplaints process and the right to refuse consent to searches of private homes;  \n \nhttp://www.aclu.org/printer/printer.php 9/13/2006\n\nACLU Page 2of 2\n(cid:122) An agreement on the part of the current Sheriff to continue her problem-solving meetings with leaders \nof the local Hmong community and to, if necessary, agree to later assistance from the U.S. Justice \nDepartment's Community Relations Service to facilitate further discussions. In return, the Her family \nagreed to waive any claim to financial damages.  \n\"We are hopeful that this case and the consent decree we were able to craft with Yuba County will both help \nimprove the professionalism of the Sheriff's Department and address some of the concerns in the Hmong \ncommunity,\" said co-counsel Mark Merin.  \n\"By agreeing to a number of new or strengthened policies and by readily agreeing to formalize a process of \ndiscussion and mutual problem-solving with the Hmong community, we are hopeful that the current Sheriff is \nmoving in the right direction.\"  \nThe case is Her v. Yuba County. \n \n \nยฉ ACLU, 125 Broad Street, 18th Floor New York, NY 10004  \nThis is the Web site of the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU Foundation. \n  Learn more about the distinction between these two components of the ACLU.    \nUser Agreement | Privacy Statement | FAQs \nhttp://www.aclu.org/printer/printer.php 9/13/2006",

Plaintiff VANG HER, who is Hmong and not a native speaker\n24  of English, requested defendant FREEMAN to provide a Hmong translator,\n25  but  defendant  FREEMAN  denied VANG HER'S request.  Instead,  defendant\n26  FREEMAN took VANG HER's 10 year old daughter, plaintiff BEE HER, outside\n27  of  the residence  without  her  consent  or the  consent  of  her parents,\n28  detained her, questioned her, and refused to permit plaintiff VANG HER to\n-3-\n\nobserve  or  be  present  during  defendant  FREEMAN'S  interrogation  of\nplaintiff BEE HER.\n8.  Defendant FREEMAN confined plaintiff BEE HER in the back\nof  his  Sheriff's  patrol  car,  closed  the  door,  and  continued  to\ninterrogate plaintiff BEE HER without her or her parents' consent.\n9.  Defendant FREEMAN returned to the HER home with plaintiff\nBEE  HER,  re-entered  the  residence  without  a  warrant  or  consent  of\nplaintiffs, and searched the home, declaring he was  looking for a B-B\ngun.\n10  10.  Defendant FREEMAN directed BEE HER to open locked areas of\n11  the house and searched those areas, repeatedly instructing VANG HER to\n12  remain silent, and threatening to put all of the plaintiffs in jail if\n13  they failed to produce the B-B gun he sought.\n14  11.  Finding no B-B gun after his warrantless search, FREEMAN\n15  departed the residence.\n16  12.  During the entire time of FREEMAN'S warrantless entry and\n17  search of the HER residence, all of the plaintiffs, including VANG HER,\n18  SAI XIONG, MAO YANG and minor children BEE HER, JOUA HER, SONG HER, SENG\n19  HER, FUE HER, SHEUR HER, and GAOHLY HER were present, and were terrified\n20  and upset by defendant FREEMAN'S entry, threats of arrest, detention and\n21  interrogation of BEE HER, and search of the premises.\n13.  On or about the morning of September 6, 1996, defendant\n23  Yuba County Sheriff  Deputy SAECHAO went  to the HER  residence  at  1336\n24  Jason Drive, in the City of Marysville, California, and without a warrant\n25  or consent from the family, directed plaintiffs SAI XIONG, MAO YANG, SONG\n26  HER, FUE HER, SHEUR HER and GAOHLY HER to enter a Sheriff's Department\n27  van for transport to a Yuba County facility where they were all detained\n28\n-4-\n\nfor several hours, against their will, and without warrants  for their\narrest.\n14.  Simultaneously  with  the  detention  of  the  plaintiffs\nmentioned  in  paragraph  12,  above,  defendant  SAECHAO  and  defendant\nWILLIAMSEN  went  to  Alicia  School  and  Linda  School  in  Marysville,\nCalifornia, whereupon they seized BEE HER, SONG HER and JOUA HER without\nwarrants  and  without  their  consent  or  the  consent  of  their parents,\nremoved them from classes and forced them to enter vehicles for transport\nto  a  Yuba  County  facility  where  defendant  SAECHAO  proceeded  to\ninterrogate  BEE  HER  without  her  or  her  parents'  consent,  without  a\nwarrant or any probable cause to arrest or to detain the juvenile.\n15.  Following hours of interrogation of BEE HER, defendants\nSAECHAO and JOHNSON loaded the family into a Sheriff's Department van and\nreturned them to their home, whereupon defendants SAECHAO and JOHNSON\nagain, without consent or warrant, re-entered the home and conducted a\nsecond unauthorized search of the HER residence, doing physical damage to\nthe premises in the process of their search.\nFIRST CLAIM\n16.  By the acts alleged in paragraphs 1 through 15 of this\nComplaint, defendants FREEMAN, SAECHAO, WILLIAMSEN and JOHNSON violated\nthe  rights  guaranteed  to  plaintiffs  by  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States to be secure in their\nhomes against warrantless searches and seizures and not to be deprived of\nliberty  without  due  process  of  law,  making  defendants  liable  to\nplaintiffs  under  the  provisions  of  ยง 1983  of  Title  42  of  the United\nStates Code, for all damages suffered by defendants.\n-5-\n\n17.  As a proximate  result of the violations of their civil\nrights  as  stated  above,  all  of  the  plaintiffs  suffered  mental  and\nemotional distress and general and special damages according to proof.\n4  SECOND CLAIM\n5  18.  By the acts alleged in paragraphs  1 through 15 of this\nComplaint, defendants, and each of them, violated California state law,\nover which this Court has supplemental jurisdiction, by falsely detaining\nand arresting each and every of the plaintiffs hereto.\n19.  By the acts alleged in paragraphs  1 through 15 of this\n10  Complaint, defendants, and each of them, violated Article 1, Section 1 of\n11  the  California  Constitution,  over  which  this  Court  has  supplemental\n12  jurisdiction.  Defendants violated each and every plaintiffs' reasonable\n13  expectation of privacy by unlawfully entering and searching plaintiffs'\n14 home.\n15 20.  By  the  acts  alleged  in  paragraphs  1  through  15  of  this\n16  Complaint, defendants, and each of them, violated California Civil Code\n17  Section  52.1,  over  which  this  Court  has  supplemental  jurisdiction.\n18  Defendants  violated  Section  52.1  by  interfering,  and  attempting  to\n19  interfere,  by  threats,  intimidation  and  coercion,  with  plaintiffs'\n20  exercise and enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution and laws of\n21  the United States and of the rights secured by the Constitution and laws\n22  of the State of California.\n23  21.  On February 21, 1997, plaintiffs filed a Government Tort\n24  Claim against defendants alleging violation and injuries arising out of\n25  the events which occurred on August 21 and September  6, 1996, as more\n26  particularly described above.  Said claim was denied by the County of\n27  Yuba Board of Supervisors on March 25, 1997.\n28\n-6-\n\n22.  As a proximate result of the false detention and arrest of\nplaintiffs,  plaintiffs  suffered  mental  and  emotional  distress,  were\ninjured  in  their  bodies  and  minds  and  suffered  general  and  special\ndamages, the precise amount of which is presently unknown, and plaintiffs\nseek leave to amend this Complaint to allege such amounts when the same\nare ascertained.\n23.  The acts of defendants, and each of them, were wanton and\nreckless, and engaged in with the intent to oppress plaintiffs who, as\nHmong people, largely ignorant of the English language, were particularly\n10 vulnerable to abuse of police power.  Such conduct justifies the award of\n11 punitive damages in an amount in excess of $250,000.\n12 WHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for judgment as follows:\n13 1.  For general and special damages according to proof;\n14 2.  For attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988;\n15 3.  For punitive damages;\n16 4.  For costs of suit;\n17\n5.  For such other and further relief as the Court may deem\n18\nproper.\n19 DATED:  July 1997 DICKSTEIN & MERIN\n20\n21\nBy:  Mark E. Merin\n22\nAttorney for Plaintiffs\n23\nf:\\her\\complaint.001\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n-7-",
