The named plaintiffs were all juveniles who alleged that they were arrested for petty offenses and then repeatedly subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches. The searches were allegedly performed pursuant to the official Alameda County Juvenile Hall policy, in which officers routinely subjected detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the juveniles possessed contraband or weapons.  That strip search policy, plaintiffs alleged, violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and California state law.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.  The County and the other individually named defendants filed answer generally denying all allegations.</p><p>On August 22, 2008, the Court (Judge Maxine M. Chesney) approved a preliminary order granting class certification and approving of the parties' Consent Decree. In the Consent Decree, the Defendant agreed to revise its strip search policy to be in compliance with state and federal law, and to pay damages of up to $4,286,660 to the Plaintiff Class who choose to file claims for damages. The Defendant also agreed to pay $1,000,000 in attorneys fees and up to $250,000 for costs associated with the litigation. </p><p>The Court officially entered judgment on February 27, 2009 and dismissed the case with prejudice.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiffs also seek an order declaring illegal defendants’\n14 policy of subjecting juvenile detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches in\n15 groups following family visits and other occasions when the juveniles return to their units.  \n16 Defendants’ strip and visual body cavity search policies, practices, and customs violated and\n17 violate the rights of plaintiffs, and each of those persons similarly situated, secured by the Fourth and\n18 Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and entitle plaintiffs, and all of those similarly\n19 situated, to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983).  \n20 JURISDICTION\n21 1.

Plaintiffs are not\n16 currently aware of the true names and identities of those sued herein as DOES 1 through 150, but\n17 will amend this Complaint to include such persons’ real names once said names are made available\n18 to them.\n19 11. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n20 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages\n21 of the state of California, COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, and/or the COUNTY OF ALAMEDA’S\n22 PROBATION DEPARTMENT. \n23 12. Defendant COUNTY OF ALAMEDA is, and at all material times referred to herein,\n24 was, a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official policy or custom\n25 or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which\n26 wrongs damaged plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.  Plaintiffs’ allegations\n27 against the COUNTY OF ALAMEDA are based on acts and omissions of the CHIEF PROBATION\n28 OFFICER, the ASSISTANT CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS, and the DEPUTY CHIEF OF\nPAGE 4\nLISA SUON, et al. v.

USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 07-01770 EMC\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\n\nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 5 of 15\n1 JUVENILE FACILITIES, and their officers, and on acts and omissions of persons who are\n2 employees of the COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, and on the COUNTY OF ALAMEDA’s breach of its\n3 duty to protect plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, from the wrongful conduct of said persons\n4 and employees.\n5 13. Defendants COUNTY OF ALAMEDA PROBATION DEPARTMENT, ALAMEDA\n6 COUNTY CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER DONALD H. BLEVINS, in his individual and official\n7 capacity, ALAMEDA COUNTY ASSISTANT CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER SHEILA L.\n8 FOSTER, in her individual and official capacity, and ALAMEDA COUNTY ASSISTANT CHIEF\n9 PROBATION OFFICER RICHARD A. MUENCH, in his individual and official capacity also\n10 maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence\n11 of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs, and all those\n12 similarly situated, as herein alleged.\n13 14. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated juveniles who were subjected by\n14 defendants to pre-detention hearing strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants\n15 having a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons and\n16 who have not yet reached adulthood or who have turned 18 within two (2) years of the filing of this\n17 complaint.  Class action plaintiffs are also those similarly situated juveniles who were subjected by\n18 defendants to strip and/or visual body cavity searches, in groups, in places where they could view\n19 the naked bodies of other juveniles being strip searched simultaneously and/or be viewed by other\n20 juveniles being strip searched simultaneously, in groups who have not yet reached adulthood or who\n21 have turned 18 within two (2) years of the filing of this Complaint.\n22 FACTS\n23 15. In or about the year 2003, plaintiff LISA SUON, then 14 years of age, was arrested\n24 for a misdemeanor offense, transported to Alameda County Juvenile Hall on Fairmont Drive, San\n25 Leandro, in the County of Alameda, California, and there, prior to a detention hearing, was subjected\n26 to a visual body cavity search in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\n27 States Constitution.  \n28 \\\\\\\nPAGE 5\nLISA SUON, et al. v. COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 07-01770 EMC\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\n\nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 6 of 15\n1 16. During  Plaintiff  SUON’s  confinement  in  the  Alameda  County  Juvenile  Hall,\n2 whenever she returned to the unit following a visit, she was subjected to a strip and/or visual body\n3 cavity search in groups of juveniles who could see each other as they were being strip searched and\n4 plaintiff SUON did, in fact, view the naked bodies of other juvenile detainees as they were required\n5 to expose their body cavities for visual inspection by defendants.  \n6 17. Plaintiff JEFFREY PAY (Date of Birth:  December 30, 1987) was arrested in or about\n7 2004, and again in 2005, for misdemeanor offenses, transported to the Alameda County Juvenile\n8 Hall on Fairmont Drive, San Leandro, in the County of Alameda, California, and there, prior to a\n9 detention hearing, was subjected to a visual body cavity search in violation of the Fourth and\n10 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  He was also repeatedly subjected to\n11 group strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches whenever he returned to the unit in which\n12 he was housed following a visit.  During those group strip searches, he could and did visualize the\n13 naked bodies of other juveniles being strip searched simultaneously and was, at the same time,\n14 viewed by other juveniles as he was being strip searched and forced to lift his genitalia for inspection\n15 and expose his rectum for visual inspection by defendants.\n16 18. Plaintiff ANDY MEAN (Date of Birth: April 13, 1988) was arrested in or about 2004,\n17 for a misdemeanor offense, transported to the Alameda County Juvenile Hall on Fairmont Drive, San\n18 Leandro, in the County of Alameda, California, and there, prior to a detention hearing, was subjected\n19 to a visual body cavity search in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\n20 States Constitution.  Plaintiff MEAN was also subjected to repetitive group strip search and/or visual\n21 body cavity searches during his confinement in Alameda County Juvenile Hall whenever he returned\n22 to the unit following a visit.  During these group strip and/or visual body cavity searches, plaintiff\n23 MEAN could see other juveniles being strip searched simultaneously and exposing their genitalia\n24 for inspection by defendants and, in turn, could be visualized by other juveniles as he exposed his\n25 naked body for inspection by defendants.  \n26 19. Plaintiff SUON is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants had\n27 no reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search of plaintiff would result in the\n28 discovery of contraband or weapons.\nPAGE 6\nLISA SUON, et al. v. COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 07-01770 EMC\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\n\nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 7 of 15\n1 20. Plaintiff PAY is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants had\n2 no reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search of plaintiff would result in the\n3 discovery of contraband or weapons.\n4 21. Plaintiff MEAN is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants had\n5 no reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search of plaintiff would result in the\n6 discovery of contraband or weapons.\n7 22. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that there was no legal justification for requiring\n8 plaintiffs to submit to strip searches in groups where they could see and be seen by persons not\n9 officially participating in the strip searches, i.e. other juvenile detainees.  \n10 23. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the\n11 ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who are still juveniles or\n12 who were juveniles within two (2) years of the filing of this Complaint and, who, while in\n13 defendants’ custody at the Alameda County Juvenile Hall, were subjected to strip searches and/or\n14 visual body cavity searches prior to appearing at a detention hearing without defendants first having\n15 a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons; and that\n16 defendants have the ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who\n17 are still juveniles or who were juveniles within two (2) years of the filing of this Complaint, who,\n18 while in defendants’ custody at the Alameda County Juvenile Hall were subjected to strip searches\n19 and/or visual body cavity searches in groups.  \n20 24. Defendants CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER DONALD H. BLEVINS,  ASSISTANT\n21 CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS SHEILA L. FOSTER and RICHARD A. MUENCH, DEPUTY\n22 CHIEF OF JUVENILE FACILITIES, WILLIAM E. FENTON, and Defendants DOES 1 through 10\n23 are jointly and severally personally responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip\n24 search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which plaintiffs herein and the persons in the class\n25 plaintiffs purport to represent were subjected to the strip searches and group strip searches\n26 complained of herein. \n27 25. As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, plaintiffs, and all\n28 those similarly situated, have suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy,\nPAGE 7\nLISA SUON, et al. v. COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 07-01770 EMC\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\n\nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 8 of 15\n1 and violation of due process of law and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and are entitled\n2 to recover damages according to proof, including exemplary damages.\n3 CLASS CLAIMS\n4 26. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs, and all those similarly\n5 situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants,\n6 and each of them.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature\n7 of the alleged offense for which the plaintiffs, and each of those similarly situated, had been arrested,\n8 without regard to whether or not plaintiffs, and each of those similarly situated, were eligible for\n9 release under Welfare & Institutions Code §§ 628 et seq.  Furthermore, the searches complained of\n10 herein were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that plaintiffs, or those\n11 similarly situated, so searched, possessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts\n12 supporting a reasonable belief that the searches would produce contraband. \n13 27. The group strip and/or visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs, and all those\n14 similarly situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of\n15 defendants, and each of them.  The group strip searches complained of herein were performed\n16 without any necessity or justification and in total disregard of the “reasonable search” requirements\n17 of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n18 28. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n19 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n20 29. The class is defined to include all persons who are currently juveniles or who reached\n21 the age of majority within two (2) years of filing of this Complaint, and who were arrested and\n22 subjected to pre-detention hearing strip and/or visual body cavity searches at the Alameda County\n23 Juvenile Hall without defendants having a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be\n24 productive of contraband or weapons.  The class includes all persons for whom there was reasonable\n25 suspicion to believe that they were concealing contraband or weapons but who were strip searched\n26 in an unreasonable manner and place, that is in groups, where they could see other juveniles who\n27 were strip searched simultaneously.  \n28 \\\\\\\nPAGE 8\nLISA SUON, et al. v.

USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 07-01770 EMC\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\n\nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 9 of 15\n1 30. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n2 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact\n3 number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are\n4 more than 20 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of defendants and\n5 subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n6 relating to said searches.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are\n7 thousands of persons in the proposed class.\n8 31. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n9 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the\n10 class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all juveniles arrested to\n11 visual body cavity searches prior to appearance at a detention hearing; (2) whether persons are\n12 subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to detention hearings without there being any\n13 reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe that any particular arrestee has\n14 concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means\n15 of a visual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted in areas of\n16 privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches, or\n17 whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups and/or in open areas where they may\n18 be observed by persons not officially participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the visual body\n19 cavity searches are reasonably related to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of\n20 the juvenile detention facility and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any\n21 such interest. \n22 32. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n23 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the\n24 class including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity\n25 searches on juveniles prior to their detention hearing without reasonable suspicion, based on specific\n26 or articulable facts, to believe any particular detainee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or\n27 contraband which would likely be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants\n28 may perform visual body cavity searches on juveniles without first reasonably relating the use of the\nPAGE 9\nLISA SUON, et al. v. COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 07-01770 EMC\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\n\nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 10 of 15\n1 visual body cavity search to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the juvenile\n2 detention facility and determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that interest; (3)\n3 whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the search can be observed\n4 by people not officially participating in the search without violating plaintiffs’ Federal constitutional\n5 and statutory rights; and, (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search policy and procedure is in\n6 accordance with the federal constitution.\n7 33. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n8 representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were subjected to strip and/or visual body\n9 cavity searches, prior to their detention hearings, without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual\n10 body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or contraband.  Plaintiffs were subjected to strip\n11 and visual body cavity searches in groups following return to their units after visits and could see\n12 and be seen by other juveniles as they were subjected to strip searches.  Representative plaintiffs\n13 have the same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the other class members.\n14 Plaintiffs’  claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees\n15 to strip and/or visual body cavity searches prior to detention hearings without having, and recording\n16 in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons;\n17 and of performing group strip searches following visits.  Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same\n18 legal theories as the claims of all of the other class members.  Each class member suffered actual\n19 damages as a result of being subjected to a strip or visual body cavity search and to being subjected\n20 to a strip or visual body cavity search in a group.  The actual damages suffered by representative\n21 plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by each class member.  \n22 34. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n23 plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ interests are consistent with\n24 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n25 35. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions\n26 of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent\n27 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter,\n28 substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interest.\nPAGE 10\nLISA SUON, et al. v. COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, et al. USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 07-01770 EMC\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\n\nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MJJ     Document 1      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 11 of 15\n1 36. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are\n2 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n3 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n4 respect to the class as a whole.  \n5 37. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action\n6 is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy\n7 between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of\n8 members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that\n9 most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are\n10 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small\n11 that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege,\n12 that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are\n13 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one\n14 forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., COUNTY OF ALAMEDA.  It will\n15 promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather\n16 than in multiple courts.  \n17 38. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are\n18 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be\n19 ascertained from records maintained by defendants COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, ALAMEDA\n20\nCOUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT, and defendants BLEVINS, FOSTER and MUENCH.\n21\nPlaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ records reflect the\n22\nidentities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody\n23\nin the Alameda County Juvenile Hall.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that\n24\nrecords  maintained by defendants reflect who was subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity\n25\nsearch, when the search occurred, where the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for\n26\nthe search existed, when persons searched appeared at detention hearings, and the charges on which\n27\nsuch persons were arrested.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the\n28\nforegoing information is contained in defendants’ computer system and that the information\nPAGE 11\nLISA SUON, et al. v.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class members\n4 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual\n5 notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and\n6 believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ computer records contain a last known address for\n7 class members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such\n8 last known address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class\n9 members of the following:\n10 i. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class;\n11 ii. The nature of the action;\n12 iii. Their right to “opt out” of the action within a given time, in which event they\n13 will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n14 iv. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to be represented by their own counsel\n15 and to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented by\n16 the named class plaintiff(s) and their counsel; and \n17 v. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to share in any recovery in favor of the\n18 class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues\n19 adverse to the class.  \n20\nCOUNT ONE\n(Violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution on behalf of Plaintiffs\n21\nand all persons similarly situated and against all Defendants and each of them)\n22\n40.

Plaintiffs incorporate herein the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint, to the extent\n9 relevant, as if fully set forth.\n10 43. Plaintiffs and all those similarly situated were minors at the time defendants subjected\n11 them to the humiliating, degrading, and unlawful strip searches complained of herein.  Defendants\n12 exploited on the young age of plaintiffs and all those similarly situated to coerce plaintiffs, and the\n13 members of the class they represent, to comply with their unlawful demands.  Defendants’ conduct\n14 was oppressive, malicious, and done in complete disregard of the rights of plaintiffs and all those\n15 similarly situated; and, therefore plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, are entitled to recover,\n16 in addition to actual damages, damages to make an example of and to punish defendants, and each\n17 of them. \n18 PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n19 WHEREFORE, plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of all those similarly\n20\nsituated, seek judgment as follows:\n21\n1.

For declaratory and injunctive relief declaring illegal and enjoining, preliminarily and\n26\npermanently, defendants’ policies, practices, and customs of subjecting juvenile detainees to strip\n27\nand/or visual body cavity searches in groups and/or in places where they can be seen by other\n28\npersons not officially participating in the search.\nPAGE 13\nLISA SUON, et al. v.

Chesney presiding. Plaintiff Class was represented by \n28\n1\n[PROPOSED] ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nSuon, et al. v. Alameda County, et al.: USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 07-1770 MMC \n\n1 Class Counsel Mark E. Merin of the Law Office of Mark E. Merin; Defendants were represented by \n2 Gregory J. Rockwell of Boornazian, Jensen & Garthe.   \n3 After considering the submissions of the parties, including the Stipulated Motion for Preliminary \n4 Approval of Provisional Settlement Class and Settlement of Class Action, together with the extensive \n5 exhibits attached thereto; the unopposed Application of Plaintiffs’ Class Counsel for Award of Attorneys=\n6 Fees and Costs; the Joint Submission of the Parties in Support of Final Approval of the Stipulation of \n7 Settlement; the arguments of counsel; and the submission from the Class Claims Administrator,  \n8 IT IS NOW ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED AS FOLLOWS: \n9 1. On August 28, 2008, this Court entered its order preliminarily approving settlement of the \n10 above-captioned class action.  Since the entry of the Court=s Preliminary Order, in accordance with the \n11 Stipulation of Settlement as proved to the satisfaction of the Court, the requisite notice of the Settlement, \n12 with opt-out and objection information, was published in the Oakland Tribune on October 25, 29, and \n13 November 5, 2008, and in the East Bay Express on October 29, November 5, and 12, 2008.  \n14 Announcements of the settlement were made on radio stations KMEL, KYLD & KSOL three times a \n15 week during the weeks of November 3, 10 and 17, 2008.  The notice of the Settlement and approved \n16 claim forms were posted by First Class Mail to the last-known address of each person in the Settlement \n17 Class.  Both the published notice and the mailed notice specified that Claim Forms had to be delivered to \n18 the Claims Administrator, postmarked no later than January 16, 2009.\n19 2. Both the published and mailed notices specified that any person who chose to object to the \n20 Settlement, either personally or through counsel, and desired to appear at the Fairness Hearing, was \n21 required to submit a Notice of Intention to appear, together with written arguments in support of any \n22 objection, by January 16, 2009.  No written objections have been received by counsel and/or filed with \n23 the Court.\n24 3. The Court finds that the Class should be and hereby is certified under Rule 23(a) and Rule \n25 23(b)(3) because it satisfies all of the requirements for certification as recited by the Court in the hearing \n26 on the fairness of the settlement on February 27, 2009.\n27 //\n28 //\n2\n[PROPOSED] ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nSuon, et al. v. Alameda County, et al.: USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 07-1770 MMC \n\n1 4. The Court is satisfied from all of the memoranda of law, declarations, and exhibits \n2 submitted to the Court, that the Stipulation of Settlement is fair, and the Court now finds for the reasons \n3 stated on the record at the hearing on February 27, 2009, that the Stipulation of Settlement is fair and \n4 finally approves it as such.  The Stipulation of Settlement is incorporated herein by this reference as if set \n5 out in full.\n6 5. The “Settlement Class” means all of those persons who are members of the following \n7 defined class and sub-classes:\n8 a. All juveniles booked and strip searched at Alameda County Juvenile Hall on or \n9 before April 11, 2007, who had not reached the age of 20 by March 28, 2007;  \n10 b. The sub-class of juveniles who were booked solely on misdemeanor, infraction, \n11 ordinance violation, or other non-felony offenses not involving violence, drugs or \n12 weapons, and strip searched during the period of their incarceration;\n13 c. The sub-class of all juveniles booked at Alameda County Juvenile Hall on felony \n14 charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons who were strip searched during \n15 the period of their incarceration. \n16 6. Persons who previously commenced civil litigation challenging the legality of any strip \n17 search at the Alameda County Juvenile hall during the class period and have prevailed, settled or had \n18 their complaints denied on their merits, and persons who have given timely notice of their election to be \n19 excluded from the Settlement Class are not included in the Settlement Class. \n20 7. All claims and complaints of the named Representative Plaintiffs, together with all \n21 persons in the Settlement Class, are now dismissed with prejudice as to all of the Released Persons, \n22 defined to include all Defendants, their predecessors, successors, and/or assigns, together with past, \n23 present and future officials, employees, representatives, attorneys and/or agents of the County of \n24 Alameda.  Claims and complaints of such persons are now forever barred, and all Settlement Class \n25 Members are enjoined from asserting against any Released Persons any and all claims which the \n26 Settlement Class Members had, have, or may have in the future arising out of the facts alleged in the \n27 complaints. \n28 //\n3\n[PROPOSED] ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nSuon, et al. v. Alameda County, et al.: USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 07-1770 MMC \n\n1 8. Each Released Person is released from the claims which any Settlement Class Member \n2 has had or may in the future have against any such Released Persons arising out of the facts in the \n3 complaint.   \n4 9. This Court explicitly finds that the Stipulation of Settlement, as amended herein and with \n5 the agreement of the parties as stated on the record at the February 27, 2009 hearing of the matter, \n6 specifically, to increase the amount allocated to pay verified claims of the Settlement Class Members, \n7 from $2,811,600.00 to $2,886,600.00, and to reduce the amount to be distributed to the Representative \n8 Plaintiffs, from $225,000.00 to $150,000.00, which Stipulation of Settlement as amended is now made \n9 final by this Judgment, was entered into in good faith, is fair and reasonable, and adequate, and is in the \n10 best interest of the Class.  The Court expressly finds the amount of attorney’s fees and costs sought to be \n11 fair and reasonable and expressly approves payment to class counsel, Mark E. Merin of the Law Office \n12 of Mark E. Merin, in the amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), as and for attorney fees and costs, \n13 for the representation of Settlement Class Members herein, to be paid as provided in the Stipulation of \n14 Settlement. \n15 10. The Court further explicitly approves payment from the payment fund of a total of One \n16 Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) to be distributed to the Representative Plaintiffs, Lisa \n17 Suon, Jeffrey Pey and Andy Mean, as specified in the Stipulation of Settlement.  The Court finds the \n18 amount is fair and adequate in view of the damages suffered by the Representative Plaintiffs and the \n19 efforts they expended in litigating this case in the more than two years from the time the original claim \n20 was filed.\n21 11. Claims have been submitted and, in accordance with the claims processing procedure \n22 specified in the Stipulation of Settlement, will be reviewed, valued, and paid by the Claims Administrator \n23 from funds provided by the Defendants as soon as practicable following the effective date of this \n24 Judgment, meaning the date it is entered and becomes final.  Such Judgment will be deemed final only \n25 upon the expiration of the time to appeal or, if a notice of appeal is filed in this matter, upon exhaustion \n26 of all appeals and petitions for writ of certiorari. \n27 12. The Court reserves continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the parties in this action, \n28 including Defendants and all Settlement Class Members, to administer, supervise, construe and enforce \n4\n[PROPOSED] ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nSuon, et al. v. Alameda County, et al.: USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 07-1770 MMC \n\n1 the Settlement in accordance with the terms for the mutual benefit of all of the parties. \n2 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the complaint in this action be \n3 dismissed with prejudice and that judgment be and the same hereby is entered pursuant to the terms of \n4 this Order. \n5 Dated: February 27, 2009  ______________________________________                            \nHON.

Does the Court have subject matter jurisdiction over all of the plaintiffs’ claim(s) \nand defendants’ counter-claim(s)?  What is the basis of that jurisdiction?  Are all \n22 \nthe parties subject to the Court’s jurisdiction?  Do any parties remain to be \n23  served? \n24   \n  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth and \n25 \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 \n26 \n27  U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1341 (3) and (4).  Plaintiffs contend that the Court has supplemental \n28 \njurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).   Venue is proper in the \nSuon, et al. vs. County of Alameda, et al .  Page 1 \nJOINT CASE MANAGEMENT STATEMENT \n\n \nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MMC     Document 17      Filed 07/19/2007     Page 2 of 10\n1  Northern District as the acts complained of occurred in Alameda County and defendants are \n2 \nwithin the district. \n3 \n  All named defendants have been served.  Plaintiffs anticipate being able to identify \n4 \nand serve any unnamed Doe defendants within 180 days after the exchange of Initial \n5 \nDisclosures but additional individual employees of named defendants may be identified \n6 \nduring discovery of class issues and plaintiffs would then move to amend the complaint to \n7 \n8  substitute those specific individuals for defendants now identified as Does.  \n9 \n2.  What are the factual and legal bases for plaintiffs’ claims and defendants’ \n10 \ndefenses? Defendants counterclaims and defendants defenses to the \ncounterclaims? \n11 \n12   \n  Plaintiff LISA SUON claims that in or about the year 2003, when she was fourteen \n13 \nyears of age, she was arrested for a misdemeanor offense and transferred to Alameda County \n14 \nJuvenile Hall in San Leandro where, prior to a detention hearing, without there being \n15 \n16  reasonable suspicion, she was subjected to a visual body cavity search.  Subsequently, during \n17 \nconfinement, at Alameda County Juvenile Hall, she claims that whenever she returned to the \n18 \nunit following a visit she was subjected to a visual body cavity search in groups of juveniles \n19 \nwho could see each other and be seen by each other as they were undergoing their strip \n20 \nsearches.  \n21 \n   Plaintiff JEFFREY PAY claims that he was arrested in or about the year 2004 and \n22 \n23  again in 2005, for misdemeanor offenses, transported to the Alameda County Juvenile Hall in \n24 \nSan Leandro and there, prior to a detention hearing, was subjected to visual body cavity \n25 \nsearch in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  He \n26 \nalso claims that he was repeatedly subjected to group strip searches whenever he returned to \n27 \nthe unit in which he was housed following any visit.  During those group strip searches he \n28 \nSuon, et al. vs. County of Alameda, et al .

Plaintiff Mean claims that \n6 \nhe was also subjected to repetitive group visual body cavity search during his confinement in \n7 \n8  Alameda County Juvenile Hall whenever he returned to the unit following a visit.  During \n9 \nthose strip searches he could see and be seen by other juvenile who were also being strip \n10 \nsearched simultaneously.   \n11 \n  Plaintiffs claim, for themselves and all others similarly situated, that the complained \n12 \nof visual body cavity searches were conducted pursuant to and in a manner authorized by \n13 \npolicies, procedures, and/or customs and practices of defendants and that the searches \n14 \n15  violated their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution \n16 \nand Penal Code § 4030 which prohibits pre-detention hearing strip searches of most juveniles \n17 \ncharged with misdemeanor offenses not involving violence, drugs or weapons and requires \n18 \nthat such searches be conducted in an area of privacy, and be pre-approved in writing by a \n19 \nsupervisor: Plaintiffs also allege that the conduct of which they complained violation the \n20 \nBane Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b)), which provides for civil \n21 \n22  penalties in cases where persons are coerced to give up their constitutional or statutory rights.  \n23 \nPlaintiffs contends that this case is appropriate for certification to proceed as a class action. \n24 \n  Defendants deny each and every of plaintiffs’ claim and contend that the matter is not \n25 \nappropriate for class certification.  Additionally, even assuming the plaintiffs’ claims are true, \n26 \ndefendants assert they are shielded from liability by the doctrines of qualified immunity and \n27 \nvarious immunities set forth in the California Government, Penal and Civil Codes.  \n28 \nSuon, et al. vs. County of Alameda, et al .

What are the factual and legal issues generally in dispute? \n2 \n \na)  Whether or not plaintiffs were subjected to visual body cavity searches (strip \n3 \n4  searches); \n5  b)  Whether or not plaintiffs were subjected to visual body cavity searches in \n6 \ngroups; \n7 \nc)  Whether or not plaintiffs were subjected to repetitive visual body cavity \n8 \nsearches; \n9 \nd)  Whether or not there was reasonable suspicion to strip search plaintiffs; \n10 \ne)  Whether or not at the time of the complained of alleged strip searches, \n11 \n12  defendants had written strip search policies that complied with the governing \n13 \nfederal and state legal authorities; \n14 \nf)  Whether or not plaintiffs were strip searched pursuant to a policy; \n15 \ng)  Whether or not the alleged searches of plaintiffs were typical of other searches \n16 \nconducted of persons admitted to defendants’ juvenile hall;. \n17 \nh)  Whether the potential class of plaintiffs is sufficiently large to justify class \n18 \n19  certification;  \n20 \ni)  Whether defendants policies and procedures for strip searching juveniles and the \n21 \nstrip searches of plaintiffs were consistent with the holding of Bell v. Wolfish \n22 \n(441 US 520, 1979) ; and,  \n23 \nj)  Whether plaintiffs suffered any compensable injury as a result of the strip \n24 \nsearches at defendants’ facility.  \n25 \n26 \n4.  What are the issues that can be narrowed by agreement or by motions?  Are there \n27  dispositive or partially dispositive issues appropriate for decision on motion? \n28 \n \nSuon, et al. vs. County of Alameda, et al .  Page 4 \nJOINT CASE MANAGEMENT STATEMENT \n\n \nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MMC     Document 17      Filed 07/19/2007     Page 5 of 10\n1    Whether or not defendants’ visual body cavity search  policies, practices, and \n2 \ncustoms, if any, were constitutional may be appropriate for resolution by motion.  Similarly, \n3 \nwhether or not individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity may also be amenable \n4 \nto resolutions by motion.  \n5 \n6    Plaintiffs’ state law causes of action may also be capable or resolution by motion.   \n7 \n5.  What are the motions anticipated by the parties? \n8 \n  a)   Plaintiffs:  \n9 \n \n10 \n  Plaintiffs anticipate filing a motion for summary adjudication as to the \n11 \nunconstitutionality of defendants’ visual body cavity search policies, practices, and customs \n12 \nas well as to the lack of merit of defendants’ affirmative defenses.  Plaintiffs anticipate filing \n13 \n14  a motion to amend the complaint to include additional named class representative as such \n15  individuals are identified; filing a motion to amend the complaint to substitute parties whose \n16 \nnames become known for defendants now identified by fictitious names.  Plaintiffs also \n17 \nanticipate filing a motion for class certification. \n18 \n19 \nb)  Defendants:  \n20 \n \n  Defendants anticipate filing a motion for summary judgment/adjudication regarding \n21 \n22  all of plaintiffs’ claims.  \n23 \n6.  What relief does plaintiff seek?  What is the amount of damages sought by \n24 \nplaintiff’s claim(s)?  How are the damages computed? \n25 \n \n26    Plaintiffs seek an order declaring illegal defendants’ policy and practice of subjecting \n27  juvenile detainees in their custody to visual body cavity searches before arraignment and \n28 \nwithout them having any reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of \nSuon, et al. vs. County of Alameda, et al .

Plaintiffs further seek an order declaring illegal defendants’ policy of \n2 \nconducting the complained of searches in areas which can be and are observed by persons not \n3 \nparticipating in the searches. \n4 \n  Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for the violation of those rights of plaintiffs, and of \n5 \nall those they seek to represent, that are secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \n6 \nto the United States Constitution.  Additionally, Plaintiffs seek on their own behalf, and on \n7 \n8  behalf of all those similarly situated, statutory damages under California Penal Code § 4030 \n9 \n(minimum of $1,000 per violation) and under California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b) \n10 \n(minimum of $4,000 per violation).  Because the size of the class of persons covered by this \n11 \nlawsuit is not yet known, plaintiffs are not prepared to provide a precise calculation of the \n12 \npotential damages in this cases; however, recoveries in individual similar cases have \n13 \nexceeded $100,000, exclusive of punitive damages, and recoveries in class actions in federal \n14 \n15  courts have been in the tens of millions of dollars.  \n16 \n  Plaintiffs also request an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. \n17 \n7.  What discovery does each party intend to pursue?  Can discovery be limited in any \n18 \nmanner?  Are there any alternative methods available to obtain the necessary \ninformation?  Should a discovery order and conference be entered pursuant to \n19 \nFed.R.Civ.P. 26(f)? \n20   \n21 \n  Plaintiffs intend to obtain the following discovery: \n22 \n1.  Documents used at the defendants’ juvenile hall in the last five (5) years that \n23 \ncover the following areas: Booking/Intake procedures; pat, strip, visual, and \n24 \nbody cavity search procedures and protocols, and clothing logs. \n25 \n26  2.  The numbers and identities of juveniles booked at the Alameda County Juvenile \n27  Hall between January 1, 2000, and the present, and a breakdown of those \n28 \nnumbers showing, by month, the number of persons booked on crimes involving \nSuon, et al. vs. County of Alameda, et al .

The names and arrest charges of the persons booked at the Alameda County \n5 \nJuvenile Hall between January 1, 2000, and the present on charges not involving \n6 \ndrugs, weapons, or violence. \n7 \n8  4.  Depositions of the jail personnel involved in the booking, processing, and strip \n9 \nsearching of plaintiffs. \n10 \n5.  Depositions of Alameda County Juvenile Hall personnel and supervisors \n11 \ninvolved in the intake, booking, processing, strip searching, and transportation \n12 \nof plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent.  \n13 \n6.  Deposition of the policy-makers at the Alameda County Juvenile Hall  facilities.  \n14 \n15  7.  Depositions of persons most knowledgeable about the Alameda County Juvenile \n16 \nHall facility’s computer systems and data retrieval systems.  \n17 \n8.  Depositions of group counselors/juvenile hall personnel who conducted strip \n18 \nsearches of pre-detention hearing detainees during the class period. \n19 \n9.  Site inspection. \n20 \n10.  Production and review of videotapes, if any, made at the juvenile hall during the \n21 \n22  relevant period.  \n23 \n11.  Production and review of training materials used to train juvenile hall personnel \n24 \nin strip search policies and procedures.  \n25 \n  Defendants intend to obtain the following discovery: \n26 \n1.   All documentation pertaining to the arrests which lead to plaintiffs’ \n27 \nincarceration.  \n28 \nSuon, et al. vs. County of Alameda, et al .  Page 7 \nJOINT CASE MANAGEMENT STATEMENT \n\n \nCase 3:07-cv-01770-MMC     Document 17      Filed 07/19/2007     Page 8 of 10\n1  2.   All documentation of plaintiffs’ arrest and incarcerations prior and subsequent \n2 \nto the arrests which they describe in the complaint in this action.  \n3 \n3.   All records relating to plaintiffs’ education, work history, and treatment for \n4 \nmental or emotional problems or substance abuse.  \n5 \n4.   Depositions of plaintiffs and family members.  \n6 \n5.   Depositions of any subsequently named proposed class \n7 \n8  representatives/plaintiffs.  \n9 \n  At this point the parties believe it is too early to determine if discovery can be limited \n10 \nin any manner.  A discovery order and conference pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(f) is not \n11 \nnecessary. \n12 \n13 \n8.  Is this case suitable for reference to a binding arbitration, to a Special Master, or \nto a Magistrate Judge for trial.  Is the case suitable for reference to the Judicial \n14 \nPanel on Multidistrict Litigation? \n15   \n16 \n  The parties do not believe this case is appropriate for binding arbitration.  \n17 \n  Neither party consents to this matter being referred to a Special Master or Magistrate \n18 \nJudge for trial. \n19 \n  This case is not suitable for reference to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. \n20 \n21 \n9.  Will this case be tried by a jury?  What is the anticipated length of trial?  Is it \n22  possible to reduce the length of trial by stipulation, use of summaries or \nstatements, or other expedited means of presenting evidence?  Is it feasible and \n23 \ndesirable to bifurcate issues for trial? \n \n24 \n25    Both parties have requested that this case be tried by a jury.  The length and evidence \n26 \nof the trial is dependent upon whether or not plaintiffs’ anticipated motion for class \n27 \ncertification is granted.  Therefore, the parties request that these matters be re-visited \n28 \nSuon, et al. vs. County of Alameda, et al .

What are the earliest reasonable dates for discovery cutoff, pretrial conference, \n11 \nand trial? \n12 \n \n  Discovery Cutoff (90 days before pretrial conf.):    August 1, 2008 \n13 \n14 \n  Final Pretrial Conf. (90 days before trial):      November 3, 2008 \n15   \n  Trial:                February 2, 2009 \n16 \n17 \n13.  What are the prospects for settlement?  Does any party wish to have a settlement \nconference with another Judge or Magistrate Judge?  How can settlement efforts \n18 \nbe assisted? \n19   \n20 \n  A settlement conference or other alternative dispute resolution may be desirable but \n21 \nthat question should be deferred until after the parties have had an opportunity to exchange \n22 \ninitial disclosures and conduct a first round of discovery.  The parties anticipate that they will \n23 \nemploy a private mediator (perhaps the Honorable Raul Ramirez (U.S. District Court Judge, \n24 \n25  ret.) to assist them in resolving this matter as he has experience in the resolution of class \n26  action strip search cases in this and other jurisdictions.  \n27 \n14.  Such other matters as any party considers conducive to the just, speedy, and \n28 \ninexpensive determination of this action. \nSuon, et al. vs. County of Alameda, et al .
