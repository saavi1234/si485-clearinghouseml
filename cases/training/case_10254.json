Most plaintiffs settled for $65,400 to be distributed among them. Three went on to trial, and were awarded $100 each in nominal damages and $15,000 each in punitive damages against the sheriff. The court denied the injunction, saying it would be unnecessary/redundant. Williams v. Kaufman County, 86 F.Supp.2d 586 (N.D.Tex. Feb 07, 2000) (NO. CIV.A.3:97-CV-0875-L).  </p><p>The judgment was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit in Williams v. Kaufman County, 352 F.3d 994 (5th Cir.(Tex.) Dec 09, 2003) (NO. 02-10500). The court (Judge Weiner) held that (1) absent individualized reasonable suspicion</p><p>or probable cause, the strip searches were unlawful; (2) the law was clearly established by the relevant time that strip-searching individuals, absent particularized reasonable suspicion or probable cause, was unlawful, thus precluding sheriff's entitlement to qualified immunity; (3) although the prolonged detention of plaintiffs was unlawful, the law was not clearly  stablished that sheriff's generalized law enforcement safety interests</p><p>were insufficient to permit the detention until search's completion, and so</p><p>the district court properly granted qualified immunity on the unlawful detention</p><p>claims; (4) plaintiffs' invasion-of-privacy claim was redundant, to the extent based on the Fourth Amendment; (5) plaintiffs failed to assert a separate,</p><p>equal protection claim arising from officers' use of racial epithets; (6) plaintiffs established county's municipal liability for their strip search and</p><p>detention; (7) the district court did not err in imposing nominal damages of $100.00 per plaintiff; (8) the record supported the district court's conclusion that sheriff acted with reckless indifference toward plaintiffs' constitutional rights, thus justifying an award of punitive damages; (9) punitive damages of $15,000.00 per plaintiff were not excessive; and (10) declaratory relief granted plaintiffs for defendants' violation of the Texas Constitution was appropriate.</p><p></p>",

Brumley (collectively \"plaintiffs\") appeal the\ndistrict court's denial of their unlawful detention, invasion of privacy, and oral harassment claims in their § 1983\nsuit against Sheriff Robert Harris (\"Harris\") and Kaufman County, Texas (\"the County\"), (collectively,\n\"defendants\"). Defendants cross-appeal the district court's judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their claims for illegal\nstrip search, municipal liability against the county, nominal and punitive damages against Harris in his personal\ncapacity, and state constitutional declarative relief. For the following reasons, we affirm.\nI. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\nIn April of 1995, Sheriff Harris obtained a search warrant, based on information he received from a confidential\ninformant, for a night club called the \"Classic Club\" in Terrell, Texas (the \"Club\"). The affidavit used to secure the\nwarrant identified five individuals suspected of dealing crack cocaine, none of whom are the plaintiffs here, and\n1000 included as suspects \"all other person or persons whose names, identities, and *1000 descriptions are unknown\nto the affiant.\" The warrant itself, however, only authorized the police to \"enter the suspected place described in\n[the affidavit] and to there search for the personal property described ... and to seize same and to arrest and\nbring before [the magistrate] each suspected party named in [the affidavit].\"\nAt about 9:45 p.m. the same day, Harris led a contingent of approximately forty (40) officers to the Club to\n[1]\nexecute the \"hazardous\" warrant.  Although some individuals were able to run away, and others outside the\npremises allegedly hurled bottles and rocks at the officers, the law enforcement personnel were able to secure\nthe outer perimeter of the search area, which included the Club's building and parking lot, and the entire city\nblock up to the roadway. On entering the Club, the officers noticed drugs on the floors and tables.\nPlaintiffs Cecil Jackson and L.B. Brumley were inside the Club; plaintiff Thomas Gene Brown was outside, but\nwhen he repeatedly attempted to gain admittance, an officer arrested him and took him inside to be searched.\nThe police detained approximately 100 people, including plaintiffs, inside the Club for about three hours. During\nthat time, officers conducted a pat-down search, strip search, and warrants check on each individual there.\nAlthough strip searches were not part of any written policy concerning the execution of hazardous warrants,\nHarris testified that it was his standard policy to conduct a strip search on each person within the search area,\n\nwith or without individualized probable cause. Also, pursuant to this \"policy,\" the officers re-handcuffed plaintiffs\n(and all other detainees) and continued to detain them after the strip searches until the entire search of the Club\nand all occupants had been completed. Brumley got obstreperous after he was strip searched and was arrested\nfor disorderly conduct.\nThree years later, 17 individuals brought suit under § 1983, claiming that Harris and the County violated their\n[2]\nFourth Amendment rights by engaging in an illegal strip search, unlawful detention and oral harassment.  Four\nplaintiffs were dismissed, and 10 others settled their claims. The three remaining plaintiffs (plaintiffs-appellants\nherein) unsuccessfully attempted to amend their complaint, in part to include an invasion-of-privacy claim.\nAt the summary judgment stage, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on (1) the\nunlawful detention claims of those plaintiffs inside the Club when the premises were secured; (2) plaintiffs'\ninvasion of privacy claims; and (3) plaintiffs' verbal harassment claims. The court denied defendants' summary\njudgment motion on (1) plaintiffs' illegal strip search claim; (2) the unlawful detention claims of plaintiffs who were\nnot originally in the Club, but were brought in only after the premises were secured; and (3) plaintiffs' policy\nclaims against Kaufman County.\n1001 *1001 After conducting a bench trial, the district court concluded that (1) Harris had conducted an unconstitutional\nstrip search of plaintiffs, and he is not entitled to qualified immunity because the rule of law prohibiting these\nsearches was clearly established at the time, making Harris's conduct objectively unreasonable; (2) Harris is\nentitled to qualified immunity on Brown's illegal detention claim, the only detention claim surviving summary\n[3]\njudgment;  and (3) Kaufman County is liable for Harris's conduct because Harris is a policymaker whose\nactions (specifically, his orally established policy of conducting strip searches irrespective of the absence of\nreasonable suspicion) had been the moving force behind the violation of plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\nBased on these rulings, the court awarded each plaintiff \"nominal damages\" of $100, and punitive damages of\n$15,000 against Harris in his individual capacity. The court also awarded plaintiffs declaratory relief, decreeing\nthat Harris and the County had violated plaintiffs' rights under Article I, section 9 of the Texas Constitution. The\n[4]\ncourt rejected plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief.  Both plaintiffs and defendants timely filed notices of appeal.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. Standard of Review\n[5]\nWe review the district court's summary judgment decision de novo.  Summary judgment is only proper if there\n[6]\nis no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  To\ndetermine whether there are any material factual issues, we consult the applicable substantive law to define\nwhich issues are material, and then consider the evidence relevant to those issues in the light most favorable to\n[7]\nthe non-moving party.\nWe review the district court's bench trial conclusions of law de novo, and findings of fact for clear error. Finally,\n[8]\nwe review the district court's decision to award punitive damages for abuse of discretion,  and examine the\n[9]\nconstitutionality of the amount of such an award de novo.\nB. Parties' Contentions\nBecause the district court addressed plaintiffs' claims at both the summary judgment and trial stages of the\nlitigation, and because the parties appeal different aspects of the judgments rendered, we briefly summarize the\nparties' contentions on appeal in the interest of clarity.\n1002 *1002 Plaintiffs make four claims (1) Harris supervised an unlawful detention, which was objectively\nunreasonable, pretermitting qualified immunity; (2) Harris's search method amounted to an invasion of plaintiffs'\n\nprivacy; (3) the officers' use of racial epithets violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights; and (4) the County is\nliable for the constitutional violations caused by Harris's conduct. In short, plaintiffs contest essentially all of the\ndistrict court's summary judgment holdings adverse to them.\nFor their part, defendants argue that (1) within the context of executing a hazardous search warrant, it was proper\nfor the officers under Harris's command to conduct strip searches; but even if plaintiffs' rights were violated,\nHarris deserves qualified immunity; (2) Harris acted reasonably in detaining plaintiffs until the completion of the\nentire search of the Club; but even if Harris acted unlawfully, he is entitled to qualified immunity; (3) the district\ncourt properly dismissed plaintiffs' claims of invasion of privacy for their failure to plead such claims; (4) the\ndistrict court properly denied plaintiffs' claims of oral harassment because plaintiffs failed to plead an equal\nprotection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment; (5) the district court erred in assessing nominal (insisting that\n$100 per plaintiff is not nominal) and punitive damages; (6) the district court erred in finding that defendants\nviolated the Texas Constitution; and (7) the County is not liable for conduct that does not amount to a\nconstitutional violation.\nC. Qualified Immunity Standard\nTo prevail in a § 1983 suit, a plaintiff must overcome an officer's defense of qualified immunity. Last term, in Hope\n[10]\nv. Pelzer, the Supreme Court rendered its most recent articulation of this standard,  which we subsequently\n[11] [12]\nadopted.  To determine whether relief is appropriate, the court must undertake a two-step analysis.  First,\n[13]\nthe court must evaluate whether a \"plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation.\"  We\naddress this inquiry in greater detail in connection with each of the contested constitutional claims.\nSecond, if a constitutional violation is found to have occurred, the court must determine whether the defendant's\nactions violated \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\n[14]\nknown.\"  The Hope Court reiterated the standard for a constitutional right to be clearly established:\n[I]ts contours \"must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity\nunless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful.... but it is to say that in the\n1003 light of pre-existing *1003 law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\"[15]\nIn Hope, the Court clarified that the factual situation from which the pre-existing constitutional right developed\n[16]\ndoes not have to be \"fundamentally similar\" to the one before a court when addressing qualified immunity.\nRather, qualified immunity can be overcome as long as \"`prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the\n[17]\nconduct then at issue violated constitutional rights.'\"  The Court concluded that \"officials can still be on notice\n[18]\nthat their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.\"\nThe appropriate inquiry, therefore, is \"whether the state of the law [at the time of the violation] gave [defendants]\n[19]\nfair warning that their alleged treatment of [plaintiffs] was unconstitutional.\"\nD. Unlawful Strip Search\n1. Whether Harris's conduct violated the Fourth Amendment\nOn appeal, defendants argue that, within the context of executing a hazardous search warrant, it was proper for\nHarris to conduct strip searches of plaintiffs. In Ybarra v. Illinois, the Supreme Court addressed the search of a\nbar patron, which occurred during the execution of a search warrant that authorized police to search the Aurora\n[20]\nTavern and a bartender named \"Greg\" for heroin and other contraband.  The Court accepted that police had a\nvalid warrant to search the premises, but concluded that \"it gave them no authority whatever to invade the\n\n[21]\nconstitutional protections possessed individually by the tavern's customers.\"  Reasoning further, the Court\nstated:\n\"[A] person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not,\nwithout more, give rise to probable cause to search that person. ... Where the standard is\nprobable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause\nparticularized with respect to that person. This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by\nsimply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize\n[22]\nanother or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.\"\nThe Court also concluded that even the initial frisk of the patron, Ybarra, much less his subsequent search, was\n1004 unjustified.[23] Although Terry v. Ohio created an *1004 exception to the probable cause requirement, allowing\npolice officers to protect themselves by conducting a patdown of a suspect, the Ybarra court held that \"[t]he\n`narrow scope' of the Terry exception does not permit a frisk for weapons on less than reasonable belief or\nsuspicion directed at the person to be frisked, even though that person happens to be on premises where an\n[24]\nauthorized narcotics search is taking place.\"\nHere, the district court concluded, relying primarily on Ybarra, that Harris's strip search of plaintiffs violated their\nFourth Amendment rights. On appeal, Harris and the County contend that the violent history of the Club created\nexigent circumstances, which threatened officer safety and thus justified the strip search of the plaintiffs. In\ncontrast to Ybarra, they argue, the exigent circumstances in this case presented a situation in which there was\n\"more\" than plaintiffs' \"mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity.\"\nAlthough the discrete facts of this case differ from Ybarra, those differences are not sufficient to create a\nmeaningful distinction. Ybarra squarely held that in premises searches like this one, police must have either\narticulable reasonable suspicion to frisk an individual or probable cause to search him. The record evidence, in\nparticular Harris's own testimony, reflects that, vis-à-vis the plaintiffs, the police lacked even reasonable\nsuspicion. None of the plaintiffs was named in the warrant, and Harris offered no reasonable belief that the\nplaintiffs in particular were armed or engaged in criminal activity. Even if, based solely on the Club's history, it had\nbeen reasonable for Harris to suspect that plaintiffs were armed or carrying drugs, searching them would still\n[25]\nhave been unlawful: Ybarra reiterated that the Terry-style search is limited to a frisk for weapons.  Harris's\nofficers frisked the plaintiffs, but found no evidence of weapons, drugs or contraband to ripen into the probable\ncause required for a full-blown search. Harris testified that the officers conducting the search had no\nindividualized probable cause as to any of the plaintiffs. Instead, he stated only that there was \"probable cause to\nbelieve that everyone in there may have had drugs on them.\" Finally, as the district court reasonably explained,\nthe intrusiveness of the search outweighed the legitimate law enforcement interests in protection and safety,\nbecause the officers had already handcuffed and patted down the plaintiffs before forcing them to undergo strip\n[26]\nsearches.\nNeither of the other two potential justifications for the strip search 00 arrest or identity in a warrant 00 mitigate the\n97 97\n1005 unlawfulness of the search. First, although two *1005 of the plaintiffs, Brumley and Brown, were arrested that\nevening, neither of the arrests justified strip searches under the applicable law. Brumley was arrested for\ndisorderly conduct after he was strip searched; thus his post hoc arrest could not have justified the search. Brown\nwas arrested before the search, but for attempting to enter the Club (claiming he owned it) in spite of an officer's\norder to leave the area.\nWe have allowed strip searches in custodial situations but, consistently, not when the suspect has committed\n[27]\nonly a minor offense and there exists no reasonable suspicion that he might possess weapons or contraband.\nAlthough Brown was attempting to enter a Club in which drugs were found, defendants offer no evidence for\nsuspecting that he possessed weapons or contraband. Indeed, Harris admitted that he had no probable cause\ntoward Brown; the arresting officer testified that he had no suspicion that Brown was carrying weapons; and prior\nto the strip search the officers took everything out of Brown's pockets, revealing no weapons or drugs, and\nthereby dispelling any suspicion of illegal activity. As a result, the subsequent strip search, after reasonable\nsuspicion had failed to mature into probable cause, was unreasonably intrusive.\n\nSecond, the affidavit that Harris filed to obtain the warrant was insufficient to justify a strip search of plaintiffs. The\naffidavit submitted for the warrant included as suspects \"all other person or persons whose names, identities, and\ndescriptions are unknown to the affiant.\" The warrant itself only authorized the police to \"enter the suspected\nplace described in [the affidavit] and to there search for the personal property described ... and to seize same and\nto arrest and bring before [the magistrate] each suspected party named in [the affidavit]\" (emphasis added). None\nof the plaintiffs was named as a suspect in the affidavit. Furthermore, as Ybarra confirmed, because the Fourth\n[28]\nAmendment requires particularity, \"`open-ended' or `general' warrants are constitutionally prohibited.\"  To\nconstrue this warrant as authorizing a general search of any person found in the Club would sanction exactly the\ntype of general warrant that the Constitution forbids.\nIn sum, the strip search of the plaintiffs was unlawful because Harris lacked probable cause toward each of them.\n2. Whether the law was \"clearly established\"\nThe district court concluded that \"no reasonable officer could have believed that conducting a strip search in\nthese circumstances, without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, was objectively reasonable.\" The court\n[29]\nnoted that both Ybarra and Watt v. Richardson Police Department  clearly established that strip searches\nconducted without individualized reasonable suspicion or probable cause are unlawful. On appeal, Harris\ncontends that reasonable officers could have disagreed about the legality of the strip search because of the\n[30]\nhazardous conditions surrounding the execution of the search warrant.\nHope instructs that once it is clear that a constitutional violation has occurred, courts must examine whether the\nstate of the law at the time gave the defendants fair warning that their behavior toward the plaintiffs was unlawful.\n1006 In this case, we agree with the district court *1006 that Ybarra and our case law on strip searches provided fair\nwarning to Harris that his conduct was unlawful. Ybarra addressed a situation substantially similar to the one\nhere, and explicitly held that officers must have reasonable suspicion to conduct a frisk or individualized probable\ncause to conduct a lawful search. Even accepting that there were aspects of this warrant's search that made it\nmore hazardous than the one conducted in Ybarra, or made it more likely that multiple persons would be in\npossession of drugs, none of these extenuating circumstances created probable cause or reasonable suspicion\n[31]\n\"particularized with respect to [plaintiffs].\"  And even if hazardous circumstances had given rise to reasonable\nsuspicion that plaintiffs, by being present, might have possessed weapons or contraband, Harris should have\nknown that his officers were limited to a patdown of each plaintiff. Thus, to the extent this case differs factually\nfrom Ybarra, it still fits comfortably under the general rule promulgated by the Supreme Court in that case.\nIndeed, Harris's declaration that \"we did have probable cause to believe that everyone in [the Club] may have\nhad drugs on them\" demonstrates his unjustified disregard or deliberate ignorance of the rule articulated by the \nYbarra court.\nIn addition, our prohibition of strip searches in other contexts presented more than fair warning at the time that\nthe strip searches at issue here were illegal. In Stewart v. Lubbock County, we employed the test articulated in \nBell v. Wolfish, balancing law enforcement interests in the search against the level of invasion of personal rights\n[32]\ncaused by the search.  We concluded that the strip search policy at issue there violated the Fourth\nAmendment because it applied to minor offenders about whom the police had no reasonable suspicion of\n[33]\npossessing weapons or contraband.  Similarly, in Watt v. Richardson Police Department, we recognized that\neven though strip searches of inmates were often allowed to maintain institutional security, when an arrestee's\noffense is minor, his criminal history innocuous or ancient, and his personal characteristics at odds with\n[34]\nreasonable fears about prison security, the strip search is illegal.\nUnlike both Stewart and Watt, this case concerns individuals outside the prison context, thus individuals toward\nwhom the police had even less individualized reasonable suspicion or probable cause 00 none, to be precise.\n97\nThus, if any law enforcement interest existed at all, it concerned only officer safety, not prison security. After\nhandcuffing and patting down the plaintiffs here, however, even this law enforcement interest ceased to exist. On\nappeal, Harris and the County repeatedly incant the hazardous conditions of the search, yet Harris admits that he\n\nhad no individualized probable cause that any of the plaintiffs had weapons, drugs or contraband. Furthermore,\neven though Brown was arrested before he was strip searched, he was arrested because he interfered with the\nduties of a public servant, not because of any probable cause or reasonable suspicion related to drugs or\nweapons. To the extent the police were legitimately worried about their safety in regard to Brown or any other\nindividuals before or during the searches, those concerns surely evanesced once the officers handcuffed and\n1007 patted down the plaintiffs. At that point, the law enforcement interests were substantially *1007 less significant\nthan those in either Stewart or Watt. Finally, weighed against this interest, the invasion of personal rights caused\n[35]\nby the strip searches here are at least if not more intrusive than in either Stewart or Watt.  In short, Stewart\nand Watt also provided fair warning to Harris that law enforcement interests in safety did not justify the extreme\nintrusiveness of strip searches especially once the plaintiffs were handcuffed and patted down.\nIn sum, Ybarra, Stewart and Watt dispel any doubt that the law was clearly established by the night of the raid in\nApril, 1995, that strip searching individuals, about whom the police had no individualized probable cause of\nweapon or drug possession, was unlawful. This in turn precludes Harris's entitlement to qualified immunity.\nE. Unlawful Detention\n1. Whether Harris's conduct violated the Fourth Amendment\nThe district court rejected Brumley's and Jackson's unlawful detention claims at summary judgment and rejected\nBrown's claim after the bench trial, all on qualified immunity grounds. The court concluded that despite its\nreservations about the length of detention, under Michigan v. Summers it was not objectively unreasonable for\nthe officers to detain all those present in the Club, including plaintiffs, until completion of the search. Although\nBrown was not on the premises when the search began, the court nonetheless also concluded that his detention\nwas not objectively unreasonable, inasmuch as Brown had voluntarily come within the search perimeter by\ninsisting on entering the Club, despite warnings to leave the area.\nOn appeal, plaintiffs claim that the court erred in granting summary judgment against Brumley and Jackson, and\njudgment against Brown, on their detention claims. Plaintiffs contend that there was no justifiable reason to detain\nplaintiffs after they were strip searched and cleared of outstanding warrants. Their continued, re-handcuffed\ndetention, they argue, was not the least intrusive method available to the police, and thus constituted unlawful\n[36]\ndetention.\n[37]\nIn Michigan v. Summers, the Supreme Court reiterated the approach by which a seizure must be analyzed.\nThere is a \"general rule that every arrest, and every seizure having the essential attributes of a formal arrest, is\n[38]\nunreasonable unless it is supported by probable cause.\"  This rule is tempered, however, by the \"ultimate\n[39]\nstandard of reasonableness embodied in the Fourth Amendment.\"  Thus, some seizures, even though longer\nthan momentary, \"constitute such limited intrusions on the personal security of those detained and are justified by\nsuch substantial law enforcement interests that they may be made on less than probable cause, so long as police\n[40]\nhave an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity.\"  Such intrusions are \"not confined to the momentary,\n1008 *1008 on-the-street detention accompanied by a frisk for weapons,\" as was involved in Terry v. Ohio.[41]\nFor determining whether a seizure falls into this exception to the general rule, the Court set out a familiar\n[42]\nbalancing test, which weighed the character of the intrusion against the character of the justification.  In \nSummers, the Court addressed whether police who were about to execute a warrant to search a house acted\npermissibly when they detained an individual who was emerging from the house and who turned out to be the\nowner, while they conducted the search. The Court found the intrusion substantially less invasive than an arrest\nbecause (1) the police conducted the search pursuant to a valid warrant, which already authorized a substantial,\nand arguably more intrusive, invasion of privacy of the detainee's home; (2) the officers were unlikely to prolong\nthe detention to gain more information because they were primarily seeking information from the search itself;\nand (3) the detention was inside the detainee's home instead of the police station, thereby minimizing the public\n[43]\nstigma associated with the event.\n\nIn comparison, the character of the justification is measured by both law enforcement interests and the nature of\n[44]\nthe articulable facts supporting the detention.  The Court identified three law enforcement interests, all of\nwhich supported the detention at issue: (1) preventing the flight of the suspect; (2) minimizing the risk of harm to\nthe police; and (3) facilitating the orderly completion of the search by having the occupant of the premises\n[45]\npresent.  Furthermore, the existence of the valid search warrant, issued by a neutral magistrate to search a\nhome for criminal activity, established probable cause that someone in the home was committing a crime, which\n[46]\nin turn provided justification for detaining the home's occupant.  The Court concluded:\nIf the evidence that a citizen's residence is harboring contraband is sufficient to persuade a judicial\nofficer that an invasion of the citizen's privacy is justified, it is constitutionally reasonable to require\nthat citizen to remain while officers of the law execute a valid warrant to search his home. Thus,\nfor Fourth Amendment purposes, we hold that a warrant to search for contraband founded on\nprobable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the\n[47]\npremises while a proper search is conducted.\nIn Heitschmidt v. City of Houston, we limited Summers to its facts. We concluded that Summers only holds that\n\"police have limited authority to detain the occupant of a house without probable cause while the premises is\nsearched, when the detention is neither prolonged nor unduly intrusive, and when police are executing a validly\n[48]\nexecuted search warrant for contraband.\"\nHeitschmidt involved a police search of a house in which the occupant, Heitschmidt, had little known connection\n[49]\nat the time of the search to the criminal activity for which the search warrant was procured.  Although the\n1009 police had a warrant *1009 to search the house, we reasoned that the intrusiveness of the detention was\nsubstantial because Heitschmidt was allegedly handcuffed on the street, pushed into the trunk of a car, and then\n[50]\ndetained for over four hours without a bathroom break.  In comparison, we found the justifications for\ndetention unpersuasive, because there was little evidence Heitschmidt would flee, or that such restraint was\n[51]\nrequired for police protection.  We reasoned further that a search warrant is a weaker basis for detention when\npolice know the occupant's identity and have no reasonable basis for suspecting that that person is engaged in\n[52]\ncriminal activity.  Finally, in contrast to Summers, we noted that the search warrant was for evidence of the\n[53]\nother house occupant's prostitution ring, not specifically for contraband.  On the basis of this analysis, we\nconcluded that Heitschmidt had adequately alleged a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, and that the right\n[54]\nalleged was clearly established. We therefore held the officers' conduct to be objectively unreasonable.\nIn this case, Harris and the County argue that the detention was reasonable. The County avers that the plaintiffs\nwere allowed to move around and use the bathroom after their individual searches, and that the three hour\ndetention was reasonable because there were 100 people on the premises. Defendants also argue that the\nviolent history of the Club, and Harris's fear that those released early would return with firearms to harm the\nofficers, justified the lengthy detention.\nThere is no question that the seizure of plaintiffs had many of the essential attributes of an arrest. We therefore\nmust determine whether the law enforcement interests outweighed plaintiffs' interest against intrusion as\narticulated in Summers and Heitschmidt. We begin by noting that some factual details of this case distinguish it\nfrom our narrow interpretation of Summers (1) Plaintiffs were customers at a public commercial establishment,\nnot occupants of a residence; and (2) plaintiffs were subjected to unlawful, unduly intrusive strip searches during\n[55]\nthe warrant-authorized search of the premises.\nFurthermore, when we apply the full Summers balancing test, we confirm that the extended detention of plaintiffs\nwas indeed unlawful. The intrusiveness of the detention was much greater than in Summers. Although Harris had\na valid warrant to search the Club, he went well beyond the limits of that warrant, conducting highly intrusive strip\nsearches of plaintiffs, about whom he had neither individualized reasonable suspicion nor probable cause. After\n1010 failing to uncover contraband *1010 or weapons on the person of plaintiffs, Harris nevertheless detained them \nand kept them handcuffed for the remainder of the three-hour search. Because this was a public establishment\n\n[56]\nand not a private residence, moreover, plaintiffs had no reason to remain at the Club during the search.  The\nillegal strip searches of plaintiffs and all other occupants added to the prolongation of the detention and\ndemonstrated Harris's intent to gain more information than he was authorized to retrieve. Last, the public stigma\nassociated with the detention was greater than in either Summers or Heitschmidt, because the detention lasted\nthree hours in a public venue, not in the obscurity of a residence.\nOn the opposite side of the scale are the law enforcement interests and articulable facts supporting plaintiffs'\ndetention. The proffered law enforcement interests in preventing flight and maintaining safety here are\nquestionable. Once the premises had been secured and the officers had strip-searched and warrant-checked the\nplaintiffs, uncovering no evidence to create probable cause, there was no need to prevent their flight and no\nidentifiable fear that, if released, plaintiffs would return to inflict harm.\nIn addition, there are no articulable facts that provide valid support for the extended detention of plaintiffs.\nAlthough Harris had a warrant to search the Club, and on that basis, had general, non-specific probable cause\nthat persons known or unknown might be committing crimes in the Club, the warrant only permitted the search of\nthe premises and the five individuals named in the affidavit. Because the warrant named specific individuals and \ndid not explicitly allow the more general search requested in Harris's affidavit, the judicially-prescribed justification\nfor the extended detention of plaintiffs was far less substantial than in Summers. Once the police had patted\ndown, strip searched, and conducted a warrants check, moreover, the police surely had no articulable and\nindividualized suspicion to justify further detention of the plaintiffs.\nNeither Brumley's arrest for disorderly conduct during the period of the detention nor Brown's arrest for interfering\nwith the duties of a public servant alters our conclusion that the extended detention was unlawful. Brumley's\narrest for disorderly conduct occurred after the search and after a period, subsequent to the search, during which\nBrumley was handcuffed and forced to lie face-down on the ground outside the Club. We cannot conclude that\nhis further detention was permissible on the basis of the arrest, because such a conclusion would effectively\nallow the police to create a potential threat to their safety through unconstitutional, provocative conduct, and then\nrely on that manufactured threat to perpetrate additional constitutional violations. Furthermore, although Brown\nhad shown a willingness to ignore police orders, he had only sought admittance because of his family relationship\nto the Club's owner. Thus, his arrest had nothing to do with the search of the Club. He was not present at the\nClub when the raid began, and the officer who arrested him testified that he had no probable cause to believe\nthat Brown was carrying a weapon. In fact, his \"arrest\" lasted only for the duration of the search and he was\nnever booked or incarcerated.\n1011 Harris and the County nevertheless persist in urging that the detention of plaintiffs *1011 was necessary for an\norderly completion of the search of the Club, and was reasonable both because of the number of persons present\nat the Club and because of Harris's fear that those released would return armed. We are aware of the\ncircumstances that the police believed they were actually facing when they executed their search warrant. The\nhistory of violence and drug use certainly gave Harris reason to worry about the safety of his officers. The nature\nof the search and the number of persons present also made the search of the Club factually distinct from the\naverage search of small groups or a single person in a less volatile venue. Given the number of persons inside\nthe Club, detention of plaintiffs for as long as reasonably required for the police to search the premises and to\n[57]\nsearch and arrest the individuals named in the warrant may have been permissible.  What occurred, however,\nwas a detention that lasted much longer than necessary specifically because of the pervasive and protracted\nillegal strip searching that occurred. We cannot credit an argument that such a lengthy detention, including the\ntime that elapsed both before and after plaintiffs were strip searched, was justifiable simply because the police\nelected to strip search scores of other Club customers.\nIn sum, the exception carved out in Summers, and shaped in Heitschmidt, is inapplicable here. Because the law\nenforcement interest proffered does not justify such lengthy, public intrusions on plaintiffs, we hold the prolonged\ndetention of plaintiffs to be unlawful.\n\n2. Whether the law was \"clearly established\"\nAlthough we hold today that the prolonged detention of plaintiffs was unlawful, we nonetheless agree with the\ndistrict court that qualified immunity shields Harris from liability. Even though Summers does not sanction Harris's\nconduct, neither did it establish a clear rule warning defendants that such conduct was illegal. The Court only\nhinted that \"[a]lthough special circumstances, or possibly a prolonged detention, might lead to a different\nconclusion in an unusual case, we are persuaded that this routine detention of residents of a house while it was\n[58]\nbeing searched for contraband pursuant to a valid warrant is not such a case.\"  Furthermore, Heitschmidt,\nwhich clarifies our views regarding these types of detentions, was not decided until after Harris's search of the\nClub.\nIn the instant case, there is no doubt that the illegal strip search of plaintiffs corrupted the legality of their\ndetention by extending it unnecessarily. Still, the objective unreasonableness of Harris's conduct in ordering a\nstrip search of plaintiffs does not automatically make his conduct in unduly detaining plaintiffs for the duration of\n1012 the search objectively unreasonable in *1012 and of itself. Whereas Ybarra established the clear rule that any full\nsearch of plaintiffs required individualized probable cause, Summers allows a seizure without probable cause\nwhen the proper balance is struck between law enforcement and personal security interests. Thus, Summers left\nthe state of the law more ambiguous as to what constituted an unlawful detention in a premises search like the\none here. In other words, under the law as it existed in April, 1995, Harris had fair warning that his generalized\nlaw enforcement safety interests did not justify strip searching plaintiffs; the law was less clear about whether\nthese same interests were sufficient to permit detention of plaintiffs until the completion of the otherwise unlawful\nsearch. We agree with the district court's grant of qualified immunity on plaintiffs' unlawful detention claims.\nF. Invasion of Privacy\nThe district court rejected plaintiffs' invasion of privacy claim on summary judgment because the then-current\npleading before the court, the original complaint, did not state this claim. The magistrate judge had 00 in his words\n97\n00 \"unfiled\" plaintiffs' amended complaint (which included the privacy claim) for failure to follow procedural rules,\n97\nand then rejected plaintiffs' second attempt to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs never objected to or sought review\nof these rulings. On appeal, plaintiffs still do not contest the magistrate judge's decision to reject their amended\ncomplaints, and instead argue that the Fourth Amendment claim pleaded in the original complaint includes the\nclaim against invasion of privacy.\nTo the extent that plaintiffs' claim of invasion of privacy rests on the Fourth Amendment, it fails because it is\nredundant to their illegal strip search claim. Even assuming that the plaintiffs could establish that strip searches\nwere not conducted in the privacy normally required (now a contested issue of fact), this transgression is\ninseparable from the illegal strip search violation itself. By finding the strip searches themselves unlawful, there is\n[59]\nno need to address a particular aspect of searches that is potentially unlawful as well.  If, perhaps, defendants\nwere within their constitutional authority to strip search plaintiffs to begin with, but impermissibly conducted the\nstrip search in a public area, then plaintiffs may have had a privacy-oriented Fourth Amendment claim. But those\nare not the facts before us today. To the extent plaintiffs purport to make a separate invasion of privacy claim, it\nwas not included in their original complaint, and they do not appeal the rejection of their attempts to amend that\ncomplaint. Thus, it is unnecessary for us to address such a claim.\nG. Use of Racial Epithets\nThe district court held that plaintiffs' oral harassment claim was insufficient because plaintiffs failed to make an\nequal protection claim or even refer to the Fourteenth Amendment in their pleadings. The court also concluded\nthat even if plaintiffs had adequately pleaded an equal protection claim, the law was not clearly established that,\nin the instant context, racial slurs alone are actionable under the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, plaintiffs\nargue that the racial slurs allegedly used by the police violate the Fourth Amendment, because the Fourth\n\nAmendment embraces all elements of a search and seizure. To support their assertion that oral racial\n1013 harassment violates the Fourth Amendment, however, plaintiffs rely on *1013 precedent prohibiting racial insults\n[60]\nand discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Plaintiffs attempt to explain, with little justification, that\nalthough the prohibition against oral harassment based on race occurred in the context of the Equal Protection\nclause, the same prohibition is part of the Fourth Amendment and thus applies to police conduct.\nWe agree with the district court that use of racial epithets deserves our strongest condemnation. None would\ndispute that this form of harassment is highly reprehensible, even more so if it occurred in conjunction with the\nalready invasive and humiliating strip searches.\nNevertheless, as appalling as such behavior would be, here it would only aggravate a seizure that we have\nalready concluded was unlawful. Thus, whether the use of racial epithets alone amounts to a separate and\nindependent constitutional violation under the Fourth Amendment is a question we need not reach because it is\nnot before us today. We have impliedly held that racial epithets that accompany harassment or a violation of\n[61]\nestablished rights may amount to a separate equal protection violation.  In this case, however, for whatever\nreason, plaintiffs chose not to make an equal protection claim.\nH. Municipal Liability\nAt the summary judgment stage, the district court concluded that Harris's strip search and detention of plaintiffs\nwas the official policy, practice and custom of the County because Harris was the final policymaker in law\nenforcement. After trial, the court also concluded that (1) plaintiffs suffered an injury as a result of this policy, and\n(2) the policy was adopted with \"callous and deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of those affected.\"\nOn appeal, plaintiffs maintain that, as Harris was the official policymaker for the County, his role makes the\nCounty liable for the strip search and detention that Harris initiated and pursued with respect to plaintiffs.\nThe law is well-established that a municipality such as the County can be held liable for its policies and customs\nthat engender constitutional deprivation, but that it cannot be held liable for the actions of its non-policy-making\n[62]\nemployees under a theory of respondeat superior.  In Webster v. City of Houston, we concluded that an official\npolicy consists of, among other things, \"[a] policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision that is officially\nadopted and promulgated by the municipality's lawmaking officers or by an official to whom the lawmakers have\n[63]\ndelegated policy-making authority.\"  We have also held that sheriffs in Texas are final policymakers in the area\n1014 of law enforcement.[64] Therefore, it is clear that the *1014 County can be held liable for Harris's intentional\n[65]\nconduct, to the extent it constitutes the \"moving force\" behind the alleged injury.\nHarris testified that he is the final policymaker for law enforcement matters in the County. Harris and others have\ntestified as well that both the strip search and lengthy detention of the plaintiffs were conducted according to the\nSheriff Department's unwritten policy for executing \"hazardous\" warrants. As a result, Harris's actions as\npolicymaker were undeniably the moving force behind, and the direct cause of, the violation of plaintiffs'\n[66]\nconstitutional rights, thereby establishing the County's municipal liability.  Finally, we note that the County has\nnot expressly contested its municipal liability, but rather argued only that it is not liable for actions that do not\namount to constitutional violations, a truism that none contests.\nI. Damages\nThe district court rejected plaintiffs' request for compensatory damages because it found that plaintiffs had failed\nto prove a specific and discernable injury to their respective emotional states. Nevertheless, the court awarded\nplaintiffs nominal damages of $100 per plaintiff, and punitive damages of $15,000 per plaintiff against Harris in his\nindividual capacity. Finding that Harris's conduct \"simply cannot be tolerated in a civilized society,\" the court\nconcluded that punitive damages were an appropriate punishment.\nOn appeal, Harris argues that: (1) nominal damages should have been one dollar; (2) punitive damages were\ninappropriate because Harris lacked evil intent or reckless and callous indifference when carrying out the strip\n\nsearch and detention; and (3) even if punitive damages were permissible, the district court's award was\nexcessive. Plaintiffs do not contest the rejection of their compensatory damages claim.\n1. Nominal Damages\nThe law is well-established in this Circuit that plaintiffs may recover nominal damages when their constitutional\n[67]\nrights have been violated but they are unable to prove actual injury.  The district court relied on the definition\n[68]\nof nominal damages from Black's Law Dictionary which equates such damages with a \"trifling sum.\"  The court\nstated that it considered $100 to be nominal \"[g]iven the value of today's dollar.\"\n1015 In Carey v. Piphus, the Supreme Court recognized the ability of courts to award \"a *1015 nominal sum of money\"\n[69]\nwhen a violation of one's rights does not result in actual injury, and awarded nominal damages of one dollar.\nThe Court did not indicate, however, that in 1978 one dollar was the outer limit of such damages. Although $100\nis obviously greater than one dollar, this amount is certainly not out of line with nominal damages that we have\n[70]\nawarded in the commercial state law context.  We agree with the district court (and regret), moreover, that\ntoday $100 is an insignificant sum, and thus see no need to disturb that court's conclusion. Further, the court's\nassessment of the situation is not clearly erroneous, much less an abuse of discretion.\n2. Punitive Damages\nJust as nominal damages are allowed without proof of injury, \"a punitive award may stand in the absence of\n[71]\nactual damages where there has been a constitutional violation.\"  But punitive damages may be awarded only\nwhen the defendant's conduct \"is `motivated by evil intent' or demonstrates `reckless or callous indifference' to a\n[72]\nperson's constitutional rights.\"  The latter standard requires \"recklessness in its subjective form,\" i.e. \"a\n[73]\n`subjective consciousness' of a risk of injury or illegality and a `criminal indifference to civil obligations.'\"  The\ndistrict court held that Harris demonstrated a reckless indifference; Harris insists that he acted in good faith.\nThe record provides more than enough evidence from which to conclude that Harris acted with reckless\nindifference toward the constitutional rights of plaintiffs. Although Harris told the court that he believed that he had\nprobable cause to suspect that everyone in the Club had some connection to drugs, it was well-established at the\ntime of this search that Harris needed individualized probable cause to search each of the plaintiffs and the\nninety-plus other individuals at the Club who were not named in the warrant. Not only did Harris lack\nparticularized probable cause when entering the Club, none materialized vis-à-vis the plaintiffs after a patdown.\nWithout any probable cause or articulable reasonable suspicion after a patdown, Harris simply had no legal\nauthority to conduct a strip search. Moreover, the magistrate who issued the search warrant gave Harris only\nenough authority to search the premises and the five individuals named in the warrant, not all others in the Club\nas requested in Harris's affidavit. We conclude that ignoring the limited scope of search authorized by the\nwarrant, and disregarding the Fourth Amendment rights of plaintiffs as long-established by the Supreme Court\n[74]\nand recognized by this Court,  constitutes reckless indifference to such rights. In addition, in light of the\n1016 testimony detailing *1016 the atmosphere of questionable privacy during the strip searches and the use of racial\nslurs, we cannot fault the district court's ruling that Harris was not acting in legal good faith. Even though Harris is\nno longer Sheriff, punitive damages not only punish him for his conduct; they serve as instructive warnings to his\nsuccessors.\nHarris nevertheless contends that, even if punitive damages are appropriate, the damages awarded by the\ndistrict court were excessive. To determine whether punitive damages are excessive, the Supreme Court requires\nconsideration of three factors (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, which receives the\nheaviest weight; (2) the disparity between the harm suffered (compensatory damages) and the punitive damages\n[75]\naward; and (3) the possible criminal and civil sanctions for comparable misconduct.\nAs outlined above, the degree of reprehensibility of Harris's conduct is high because he perpetrated extremely\ninvasive searches on innocent individuals without specific probable cause or reasonable suspicion, in\n\ncontravention of the warrant itself and clear precedent. Second, we agree with the district court that any punitive\ndamages-to-compensatory damages \"ratio analysis\" cannot be applied effectively in cases where only nominal\ndamages have been awarded, such as the § 1983 suit before us. The Supreme Court has counseled that this\nfactor does not impose a mathematical formula for constitutional proportionality, but instead only embodies \"a\n[76]\ngeneral concern of reasonableness.\"  Because actions seeking vindication of constitutional rights are more\nlikely to result only in nominal damages, strict proportionality would defeat the ability to award punitive damages\n[77]\nat all.  Based on our review of the case law and our consideration of the evidence weighed by the district\n[78]\ncourt, we conclude that $15,000 per plaintiff is not unreasonable in light of the violations that took place.\n1017  J. Declaratory Relief\n*1017\nFinally, Harris and the County contend that they did not violate Article I, section 9 of the Texas Constitution, which\nmirrors the language of the Fourth Amendment. Both parties acknowledge that this constitutional provision is\ninterpreted as congruent with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Indeed, the Texas Court of Appeals has held that\n\"our article I, section 9 provides at least as much protection as the Fourth Amendment of the United States\n[79]\nConstitution.\"  Thus, based on our earlier conclusions that Harris and the County violated the Fourth\nAmendment, we also conclude that the declaratory relief granted to plaintiffs is appropriate.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the district court are, in all respects,\nAFFIRMED.\n[*] United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas, sitting by designation.\n[**] This opinion replaces the August 19, 2003 opinion in this case, 343 F.3d 689 (5th Cir. 2003), which is hereby\nwithdrawn.\n[1] According to the district court, the Kaufman County Sheriff's department considers the execution of a narcotics\nwarrant a \"hazardous entry,\" where weapons are likely to be present. Additionally, in a March 1994 search of the\nClub, police found drugs, drug paraphernalia, and a concealed .25 caliber pistol. After this search, Harris\napparently received an anonymous telephone call threatening to kill him if he returned to the Club. Harris also\ntestified that an officer had been shot at previously while attempting to execute a warrant at the Club.\n[2] Plaintiff brought a variety of other claims, such as excessive force, civil conspiracy, assault and battery, and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, but all were rejected on summary judgment and have not been\nappealed to us.\n[3] The district court dismissed the unlawful detention claims of all of the Group 1 plaintiffs, who consisted of\nthose inside the Club when the premises were secured by police, but allowed to go to trial the detention claims of\nthe Group 2 plaintiffs, who consisted of those outside of the Club when the premises were secured. Plaintiff\nThomas Gene Brown was outside the Club when the premises were secured, and therefore should have been\nnamed in Group 2. When the court described the different groups of plaintiffs, however, it placed Brown in Group\n1. As the court subsequently addressed Brown's unlawful detention claim at trial, the implied inclusion of his\nname in Group 1 at the summary judgment stage appears to have been an inadvertent and harmless mistake.\n[4] The court also directed the parties to attempt to resolve the attorneys' fees issues themselves.\n[5]Harper v.

Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) justifies\nstrip searches on the reasonable suspicion that an individual is concealing weapons or contraband.

Thus, the intrusiveness/law enforcement\n\ninterests balance was more heavily in favor of law enforcement than the one conducted here, in which the police\nlacked both articulable reasonable suspicion and probable cause of wrong-doing to conduct any type of search.\n[27]Watt v.

Although Harris had a valid\nwarrant to search the premises, we have already concluded that the strip search of plaintiffs was both improper\nand illegal, and exceeded the scope of that warrant.\n[56] Because Brown's nephew owned the Club, he apparently had an interest in finding out what was happening\nat the Club. But this interest did not necessarily include remaining at the Club while the search was conducted.\nHe had not been at the Club that evening, and was brought inside after the police had begun the raid. Thus, his\npossible reasons for being there are not the same as the house owner in Summers or Heitschmidt.\n[57] The ultimate standard of reasonableness in the Fourth Amendment and the fact-specific character of these\ncases dissuade us from attempting to decide exactly what would have been a permissible period of detention had\nthe police conducted a lawful search. In other contexts, we have held that when an officer pats down a person\nwhom he reasonably suspects is carrying a weapon, and finds nothing, the officer may not further detain the\nindividual, because his suspicion \"has evaporated and no longer justifies further detention.\" United States v.\nShabazz, 993 F.2d 431, 436 (5th Cir.1993). Similarly, it is well-established in this Circuit that a detention should\nend as soon as the underlying justification for the stop is served, for instance by running a computer check that\ncomes back negative; any further detention becomes an unreasonable seizure because it is unsupported by\nprobable cause.

The district court did not need to determine\nwhether Harris's conduct also amounted to deliberate indifference, because that element must be shown only\nwhen there is a claim that the municipality's facially lawful action caused an employee to inflict the injury, not\nwhen the municipality (through its policymaker) has directly caused the injury, as has occurred here. Thus, it is\nunnecessary to examine the deliberate indifference issue to establish liability in this instance. See id. at 406-07,\n117 S.Ct. 1382 (reiterating that a \"plaintiff seeking to establish municipal liability on the theory that a facially\n\nlawful municipal action has led an employee to violate a plaintiff's rights must demonstrate that the municipal\naction was taken with `deliberate indifference' as to its known or obvious consequences\") (citation omitted).\n[67]Louisiana ACORN Fair Housing v.

The Supreme Court's recent\nrevisit of the Gore factors in State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Campbell does not alter our\nconclusion here. 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003). Campbell reviewed jury-awarded\ncompensatory damages of $1 million and punitive damages of $145 million; and although the Court stated that\nextreme ratios should be presumptively invalid, it discussed the constitutionality of punitive damages vis-a-vis \ncompensatory damages awarded by juries. See id. at 1521, 1524. As the instant case concerns the ratio between\npunitive and nominal damages, Campbell's discussion of the proper ratio between punitive and compensatory\ndamages is inapposite to our consideration today.\n[77] The third factor, what comparable criminal and civil sanctions would have been for Harris, is not easily\napplicable to this type of constitutional violation, because there is no readily identifiable law imposing civil or\ncriminal penalties on law enforcement officers for such violations.\n[78] Our research has revealed relatively few other cases addressing the amount of punitive damages awarded in\nthe context of civil rights actions. The Second Circuit concluded that $10,000 in punitive damages when only\nnominal damages were awarded \"approaches the limits of what we would deem consistent with constitutional\nconstraints.\" Provost v. City of Newburgh, 262 F.3d 146, 164 (2nd Cir.2001). In a case concerning the illegal strip\nsearch of a prisoner, the Seventh Circuit reduced a jury-decided punitive damages award of $15,000 to $6,000. \nMcKinley v. Trattles, 732 F.2d 1320, 1327-28 (7th Cir.1984). For the illegal strip search of high school students,\nthe New Mexico Supreme Court approved punitive damages awards of $62,500 to one plaintiff and $37,500 to\nthe other plaintiff, but also awarded compensatory damages of $50,000 to each. Kennedy v. Dexter Consol. Sch.,\n129 N.M. 436, 10 P.3d 115, 118, 125-126 (2000). \nAlthough $15,000 may be slightly higher in this case than in cases decided by other circuits, two factors convince\nus that the amount is nonetheless reasonable: (1) our review of the evidence before the district court regarding\nthe type of conduct that occurred, and (2) our necessarily unscientific balancing of the factors laid out in Gore.\n[79]State v.

For  the  reasons \nentitled by responding to the motion.  previously stated, the court finds that $375 per hour is a \n   reasonable hourly rate; and the court also determines that \nUnder these circumstances, ordinarily, the court does not  the costs requested, $458.30, are reasonable. Accordingly, \nbelieve it should decide this portion of Plaintiffs’ second  Plaintiffs  are  hereby  awarded  fees  in  the  amount  of \nsupplemental  fee  request.  In  all  cases  the  court  has  $10,762.50  (28.7  x  $375  per  hour)  and  costs  in  the \nreviewed,  the  district  court  determined  the  amount  of  amount of $458.30. The amount for attorney’s fees and \nattorney’s fees incurred relating to an appellate matter  costs for this aspect of their second supplemental motion \nonly after the case had been remanded by the Fifth Circuit  is $11,220.80. \nwith instructions to the district court to determine the    \namount of attorney’s fees and costs to be awarded.

      "text": "86 F.Supp.2d 586 (2000)\nOscar D. WILLIAMS, et al., Plaintiffs,\nv.\nKAUFMAN COUNTY, et al., Defendants.\nNo. CIV.A. 3:97-CV-0875-L.\nUnited States District Court, N.D. Texas, Dallas Division.\nFebruary 7, 2000.\n558878 *587*588 William Charles Bundren, Dallas, TX, for plaintiffs.\nS. Cass Weiland, Caryn Carson, Sheinfeld, Maley & Kay, Dallas, TX, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nLINDSAY, District Judge.\nBefore the court is Defendants' Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment, filed November 30, 1998. Upon\nconsideration of the motion, Plaintiffs' response, Defendants' reply, the entire summary judgment record, and the\napplicable law, the court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' Supplemental Motion for Summary\n589 Judgment. Specifically, the court grants summary judgment on Plaintiffs' verbal harassment and invasion of *589\nprivacy claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, grants summary judgment with respect to the Group 1 Plaintiffs'\n[1]\n claim of unlawful detention, grants summary judgment on all claims of Karran Brown, denies summary\njudgment on Plaintiffs' illegal strip search, denies summary judgment on the unlawful detention claims with\nrespect to the Group 2 Plaintiffs, and denies summary judgment on Plaintiffs' policy claims.\nI. Procedural and Factual Background\nThis action was filed by Plaintiffs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Kaufman County and Kaufman County\nSheriff Robert Harris. On November 12, 1998, the court adopted the findings, conclusions, and recommendation\nof the magistrate judge and overruled the objections filed by the parties. Specifically, the court granted\nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment regarding the following matters: Plaintiffs' excessive force claim;\nPlaintiffs' claim for damages resulting from an alleged violation of the Texas Constitution; and Plaintiffs' state law\nclaims for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy. The court denied\nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief regarding\nDefendants' alleged violations of Article 1, Section 9 of the Texas Constitution. Defendants did not raise the\nfollowing matters in their initial motion for summary judgment: Plaintiffs' claims based upon illegal strip search,\nunlawful detention, invasion of privacy, and verbal harassment based on race. Defendants raised these issues for\nthe first time in their reply to Plaintiffs' Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. The court\ndirected Defendants to file a second motion for summary judgment by November 30, 1998, to address these\nclaims.\nSheriff Harris contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Plaintiffs' Section 1983 claims,\nincluding the allegedly illegal strip search, unlawful detention, invasion of privacy and verbal harassment.\nKaufman County contends that it is not liable to Plaintiffs because they suffered no constitutional injury as a result\nof a policy or custom of Kaufman County. Both Defendants have moved for summary judgment, seeking\ndismissal of the claims. Plaintiffs, of course, oppose Defendants' Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment.\nThis lawsuit results from a search warrant that was executed at the Classic Club (the \"Club\") in Terrell, Texas, on\nthe evening of April 21, 1995. Kaufman County Sheriff Robert Harris obtained a warrant from a local magistrate\n\nafter a confidential informant provided him information that certain individuals were selling rock cocaine at the\nClub. The warrant authorized officers to search the Club and \"all other buildings, structures, and vehicles on said\npremises\" and arrest five named individuals (Ronnie \"Fat\" Jackson, \"Head\" Jackson, Harold Jackson, Kirk Martin\nand Karron (sic) Brown) who were suspected of criminal activity.\nThe Sheriff's Department considers the execution of a narcotics warrant a \"hazardous entry\" when there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that weapons will be present on the scene. During a previous search of the Club in March\n1994, officers found large quantities of crack cocaine and marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and found a\nconcealed .25 caliber automatic pistol on a person. After the March 1994 search was conducted, Sheriff Harris\nreceived an anonymous telephone call in which the caller threatened to \"blow [his] head off\" if he ever returned to\nthe Club.\n590 The warrant was executed by officers from several different Kaufman County *590 law enforcement agencies\npursuant to a mutual aid agreement. Although an officer might have been employed by another department, the\nmutual aid agreement required the officer to be under the control of the specific department that requested his\nassistance. Since Sheriff Harris coordinated the raid and was present during the execution of the warrant, all the\nofficers involved were acting under his control and supervision. When the officers entered the Club, drugs were\nvisible on the floor and tables. In order to secure the premises, the officers then handcuffed everyone present\nand ordered them to lie down on the floor. Each person was strip searched and his or her name was run through\na police computer to check for outstanding warrants. The individuals who were not in possession of drugs and did\nnot have outstanding warrants were led outside and held until the search was completed, which lasted, by some\naccounts, up to four hours. The individuals, according to Defendant Harris, were not released because of safety\nconcerns. The officers detained everyone present at the Club, fearful that the released individuals might group\ntogether, return with firearms, and create \"an extraordinarily hazardous and racially charged environment.\" Sheriff\nHarris also believed that the detention of the individuals was necessary to ensure an orderly and efficient\nexecution of the search warrant.\nThe original Plaintiffs are seventeen individuals who were detained and searched the evening the search warrant\nwas executed at the Club. They are: Oscar D. Williams, Jr., Thomas Gene Brown, Leonard Avery, Francis\nBooker, Cecil Jackson, Jacquelynn Surrell, Ricky Lewis, Brenda Allen, James McDonald, Sylvester Lewis, L.B.\n[2]\nBrumley, Clifford Gibson, Gloria Surrell, Alisa Allen, John Jackson, Karran Brown, and David Brown.  With the\nexception of Karran Brown, none of Plaintiffs was named in the warrant. Four Plaintiffs (Oscar Williams, Jr.,\nClifford Gibson, James McDonald, and Leonard Avery) were not inside the Club or on the premises when the\nsearch began. Both Oscar Williams, Jr., and Clifford Gibson were inside of their respective vehicles driving on a\npublic street when they were stopped and removed from their cars and brought inside of the Club. James\nMcDonald had just left the Club and was told to return. Leonard Avery was asleep inside an apartment in his\nplace of business, M.J. Carpets, which is a separate business adjacent to the Club. The Club's address was 606\nSouth Adelaide, and M.J. Carpets' address was 602 South Adelaide. These four Plaintiffs will collectively\nhereinafter be referred to as \"Group 2.\" The remaining Plaintiffs who were present at the Club the night the\nsearch warrant was executed will be referred to as \"Group 1.\"\nII. Summary Judgment Standard\nSummary judgment shall be rendered when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\nand that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n477 U.S. 317, 323-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Ragas v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, 136\nF.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir.1998). A dispute regarding a material fact is \"genuine\" if the evidence is such that a\nreasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court is\nrequired to view all inferences drawn from the factual record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. \n591 Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. *591 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538\n(1986); Ragas, 136 F.3d at 458.\n\nOnce the moving party has made an initial showing that there is no evidence to support the nonmoving party's\ncase, the party opposing the motion must come forward with competent summary judgment evidence of the\nexistence of a genuine fact issue. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348. Mere conclusory allegations are\nnot competent summary judgment evidence, and thus are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. \nEason v. Thaler, 73 F.3d 1322, 1325 (5th Cir.1996). Unsubstantiated assertions, improbable inferences, and\nunsupported speculation are not competent summary judgment evidence. See Forsyth v. Barr, 19 F.3d 1527,\n1533 (5th Cir.),cert denied,513 U.S. 871, 115 S.Ct. 195, 130 L.Ed.2d 127 (1994). The party opposing summary\njudgment is required to identify specific evidence in the record and to articulate the precise manner in which that\nevidence supports his claim. Ragas, 136 F.3d at 458. Rule 56 does not impose a duty on the court to \"sift through\nthe record in search of evidence\" to support Plaintiff's opposition to Defendants' motion. Id., Skotak v. Tenneco\nResins, Inc., 953 F.2d 909, 915-16 & n. 7 (5th Cir.),cert. denied,506 U.S. 832, 113 S.Ct. 98, 121 L.Ed.2d 59\n(1992) \"Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing laws will properly\npreclude the entry of summary judgment.\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Disputed fact issues\nwhich are \"irrelevant and unnecessary\" will not be considered by a court in ruling on a summary judgment\nmotion. Id. If the nonmoving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\nessential to its case and on which it will bear the burden of proof at trial, summary judgment must be granted. \nCelotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548.\nIII. Analysis\nA. Doctrine of Qualified Immunity\nGovernment officials who perform discretionary functions are entitled to the defense of qualified immunity, which\nshields them from suit as well as liability for civil damages if their conduct does not violate \"clearly established\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). A defendant official must affirmatively plead the defense of\nqualified immunity. Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980). Defendant\nHarris has pleaded this defense.\nIn deciding a motion for summary judgment that raises the defense of qualified immunity, the court must first\ndecide \"whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so, proceed\nto determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\" Conn v. Gabbert, 526\nU.S. 286, 119 S.Ct. 1292, 1295, 143 L.Ed.2d 399 (1999), citing Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232-33, 111 S.Ct.\n1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991); see also Kerr v. Lyford, 171 F.3d 330, 339 (5th Cir.1999). The second prong of the\ntest requires the court to make two separate inquiries: whether the right allegedly violated was clearly established\nat the time of the event giving rise to the plaintiff's claim, and if so, whether the conduct of the defendant was\nobjectively unreasonable. Evans v. Ball, 168 F.3d 856, 860 (5th Cir. 1999). Although many cases continue to state\nthat the determination of the qualified immunity issue requires the application of a bifurcated test, the analytical\nframework for resolving issues of qualified immunity necessarily requires, or may require, a three-step analysis. \nSee Kerr v. Lyford, 171 F.3d at 339 (5th Cir.1999); Evans v. Ball, 168 F.3d at 860; Hare v. City of Corinth, 135\nF.3d 320, 326 (5th Cir.1998); Eugene v. Alief Indep. Sch. Dist., 65 F.3d 1299, 1305 (5th Cir.1995),cert denied,\n517 U.S. 1191, 116 S.Ct. 1680, 134 L.Ed.2d 782 (1996).\n592 *592 Whether a defendant acted within the scope of his authority performing a discretionary function and whether\na reasonable official in his position would have deemed his conduct unconstitutional are not to be considered by\nthe court unless each part of the three-step inquiry has been answered affirmatively on behalf of the plaintiff. Kerr\nv. Lyford, 171 F.3d at 339. In other words, only after a plaintiff demonstrates the existence and violation of a\nclearly established constitutional or statutory right is the defendant required to show that he was performing a\ndiscretionary function and that a reasonable official would not have considered his actions to be unconstitutional\nat the time of the incident in question. Id. at 338.\nA right is \"clearly established\" only when its contours are sufficiently clear that a reasonable public official would\nhave realized or understood that his conduct violated the right in issue, not merely that the conduct was\n\notherwise improper. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); \nFoster v. City of Lake Jackson, 28 F.3d 425, 429 (5th Cir.1994). Thus, the right must not only be clearly\nestablished in an abstract sense but in a more particularized sense so that it is apparent to the official that his\nactions [what he is doing] are unlawful in light of pre-existing law. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. at 640, 107\nS.Ct. 3034; Stefanoff v. Hays County, 154 F.3d 523, 525 (5th Cir.1998); and Pierce v. Smith, 117 F.3d 866, 871\n(5th Cir.1997).\nIn Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, the Supreme Court refined the qualified immunity\nstandard and held that the relevant question is whether a reasonable officer or public official could have believed\nthat his conduct was lawful in light of clearly established law and the information possessed by him. If public\nofficials or officers of \"reasonable competence could disagree [on whether an action is legal], immunity should be\nrecognized.\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986); Gibson v. Rich, 44 F.3d\n274, 277 (5th Cir.1995) (citing Babb v. Dorman, 33 F.3d 472, 477 (5th Cir.1994)). Conversely, an official's conduct\nis not protected by qualified immunity if, in light of clearly established pre-existing law, it was apparent the\nconduct, when undertaken, would be a violation of the right at issue. Foster v. City of Lake Jackson, 28 F.3d at\n429. To preclude qualified immunity, it is not necessary for a plaintiff to establish that \"the [specific] action in\nquestion has previously been held unlawful.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034; however,\nfor an official to surrender qualified immunity, \"pre-existing law must dictate, that is, truly compel (not just suggest\nor allow or raise a question about), the conclusion for every like-situated, reasonable government agent that what\nthe defendant is doing violates federal law in the circumstances.\" Pierce v. Smith, 117 F.3d at 882; Stefanoff v.\nHays County, 154 F.3d at 525. With these standards for summary judgment and qualified immunity in mind, the\ncourt now addresses the issues raised in Defendants' Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment.\nB. Illegal Strip Search\n1. Allegation of Constitutional Right\nSheriff Harris contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity on this claim. The court, however, must first\naddress whether Plaintiffs have alleged the violation of a constitutional right. Conn, 119 S.Ct. at 1295. Plaintiffs\nallege that the strip search was conducted in violation of their constitutional rights. Plaintiffs contend that the\nsearch exceeded the scope of the warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Further, they argue that the\nFourth Amendment ensures that they will be free from warrantless strip searches in the absence of any probable\ncause or reasonable suspicion to believe that any of the Plaintiffs were concealing contraband or weapons\nunderneath their clothing.\n593 *593 The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment requires that the warrant \"particularly describe the place to\nbe searched and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. Amend. IV. The scope of a lawful search is\n\"defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be\nfound.\" Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S.Ct. 1013, 94 L.Ed.2d 72 (1987)(quoting U.S. v. Ross, 456\nU.S. 798, 824, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982)). The requirement that warrants particularly describe the\nobjects to be seized protects individual privacy interests, thereby preventing general searches. The Fourth\nAmendment is violated when a law enforcement officer conducts an unreasonable search.\nThe warrant that Sheriff Harris obtained authorized the law enforcement officers to \"enter the suspected place\ndescribed in said Affidavit and to there search for the personal property described in said Affidavit and to seize\nsame and to arrest and bring before [the magistrate] each suspected party named in the Affidavit.\" The Affidavit\ndefined the \"suspected place\" as that of the Club, while describing the \"suspected party\" to include five\nindividuals specifically named. The only Plaintiff who was specifically named in the warrant was Karran Brown.\nIn Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 88, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979), a warrant was obtained allowing a\nsearch of \"the following person or place: ... [T]he Aurora Tap Tavern.... Also the person of `Greg,' the bartender, a\nmale white with blondish hair appx (sic) 25 years.\" The search warrant allowed the officers to search for evidence\nof heroin. Id. After entry into the establishment, officers conducted a pat-down of all of the customers in the\ntavern. Id. The Court noted that if the judge issuing the warrant intended to allow a search of every person within\n\nthe establishment, he would not have specifically stated \"Greg.\" Id. at 90 n. 2, 100 S.Ct. 338. The Court\ndetermined that officers lacked probably cause at the time the search warrant was issued to believe that any\nperson at the tavern, with the exception of Greg, would be or had been violating the law. Id. at 90, 100 S.Ct. 338.\nFurthermore, the Court stated that probable cause did not exist at the time the search was actually conducted. Id.\nThe Court further stated, \"Every patron who walked into the Aurora Tap Tavern on March 1, 1976, was clothed\nwith a constitutional protection against an unreasonable search or an unreasonable seizure.\" Id. at 91, 100 S.Ct.\n338.\nPlaintiffs have a Fourth Amendment right to be free from searches in the absence of individualized probable\ncause or reasonable suspicion. The police officers' alleged necessity to conduct the strip search does not\noutweigh the Plaintiffs Fourth Amendment rights in this case. As Plaintiffs have alleged that they were subjected\nto an unlawful and unreasonable strip search, they have alleged a violation of a constitutional right. Therefore,\nPlaintiffs have satisfied the first prong of Conn.\n2. Clearly Established Right\nNow that the court has determined that Plaintiffs have alleged a constitutional right, the court must determine\nwhether the right was clearly established in April 1995. The court concludes that the right to be protected from an\nillegal strip search was clearly established in April 1995. A right is \"clearly established when it is clear that a\nreasonable officer would have acknowledged that his conduct violated the right at issue.\" Anderson v. Creighton,\n483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034. The first question is whether it was clearly established that Plaintiffs were\nentitled to a constitutional right to be free from an unreasonable search, absent a showing of probable cause. In \nYbarra, a customer was subjected to a search when he was present at an establishment subject to a search\n594 warrant. Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. at 88, 100 S.Ct. 338. The Court in that case found that the officers did not \n*594 have particularized probable cause to conduct a pat-down of Ybarra. Id. at 91, 100 S.Ct. 338. The Court\nstated: \"Where the standard is probable cause, a search or a seizure of a person must be supported by probable\ncause particularized with respect to that person. This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided simply by\npointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the\npremises where the person may happen to be.\" Id. Likewise, every Plaintiff at the Club was entitled to a\nconstitutional right against an unreasonable search. Although the police had probable cause to search the Club\nand the persons described in the warrant, they did not have probable cause to strip search every individual in the\nClub and persons who were not even present on the premises. A strip search in this instance is legally\npermissible only if an officer has an individualized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is hiding weapons or\ncontraband, and this suspicion must be specific to that individual. See Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dept.,\n849 F.2d 195, 197 (5th Cir.1988). In the present case, at best, speculation existed regarding the presence of\ncontraband on the individual Plaintiffs. Speculation simply does not create the reasonable, individualized\nsuspicion that would justify a strip search.\nBased on Ybarra and Watt, which were decided fifteen and seven years, respectively, before the search in this\ncase occurred, the court finds that the right to be free from an unreasonable strip search was clearly established.\nIn Ybarra, the court held unconstitutional the pat-down and the reaching into an individual's pants pocket. In light\nof the holding in Ybarra, it would be apparent to a reasonable officer that conducting an intrusive strip search\nwould be constitutionally impermissible. Plaintiffs' have satisfied the second prong of Conn. Having resolved this\nissue, the court now determines whether Sheriff Harris' conduct was objectively unreasonable.\n3. Objectively Unreasonable Conduct\nIn deciding whether Sheriff Harris' conduct was objectively unreasonable, the court must determine whether a\nreasonable officer could have believed that Sheriff Harris' conduct was lawful in light of clearly established law. If\nreasonable officers could disagree whether the strip search was unconstitutional, Sheriff Harris is entitled to\nqualified immunity. See Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. at 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092. In order to determine whether a search\nis reasonable, the individual's Fourth Amendment interest must be weighed against the necessity for a particular\ntype of search. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). The court should\n\nconsider \"the scope of the intrusion, the manner in which it is executed, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\" Id. If under Ybarra a less intrusive search, a pat-down, was held to be\nunconstitutional, it should have been even more evident and unequivocally clear that a much more intrusive strip\nsearch would not be constitutionally permissible. Defendants argue that when the warrant was executed, there\nwas reason to believe that weapons might be present. At most, this might have authorized a pat-down to check\nfor weapons for the safety of the officers; however, it is fatuous and unreasonable to suggest that a highly\nintrusive strip search was necessary to protect the officers' safety. This dog simply will not hunt! Once the pat-\ndown took place, the objective to ensure the officers' safety had been accomplished. The court concludes that,\nbased upon the summary judgment evidence, a reasonable officer could not have believed that the conduct,\nrequiring a strip search of both Plaintiffs who were not present at the Club, as well as Plaintiffs who were on the\nClub's premises, without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, was objectively reasonable. The sheriff and the\nofficers under his control had no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to conduct the strip search.\n595 *595 Even if Defendants were able to establish probable cause of reasonable suspicion directed towards one of\nthe Plaintiffs 00 Karran Brown 00 it still would not justify such an intrusive search 00 the strip search of all Plaintiffs.\n97 97 97\nIn U.S. v. Afanador, 567 F.2d 1325 (5th Cir.1978), an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\nreceived information that one of the airline crew members would be arriving into the United States carrying\ncocaine. Id. at 1327. Upon arrival, all six crew members were subjected to strip searches. Id. at 1328. The court\nupheld the strip search as to the individual crew member who was the subject of the reasonable suspicion;\nhowever, the court held that reasonable suspicion was not satisfied with respect to the other crew members. Id.\nat 1330. The court unequivocally refused to allow the strip search of the remaining crew members and held that it\nwould allow such an intrusive search only when reasonable suspicion is directed toward a specified individual. Id.\nat 1331. The court in that case also recognized that a reasonable belief that justifies \"a particular search may not\nsuffice to justify a more intrusive or demeaning search.\" Id. \"The court must answer on a case-by-case basis\nwhether the police were unreasonable in failing to use a less intrusive procedure to conduct their investigation\nsafely.\" U.S. v. Campbell, 178 F.3d 345 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting U.S. v. Sanders, 924 F.2d 200, 206-07 (5th\nCir.1993)). In analyzing unreasonableness, the question is not whether a viable alternative is available, but if\nofficers were unreasonable when they did not acknowledge or pursue it. U.S. v. Sanders, 924 F.2d at 204.\nDefendants have argued that to ensure the safety of officers, a strip search was conducted to locate possible\nweapons. This goal, without doubt, could have been accomplished through a viable alternative 00 a pat-down.\n97\nWhen Sheriff Harris obtained the warrant based upon an informant observing that five individuals were present\nduring the selling of rock cocaine, probable cause existed to search and arrest the five individuals who were\nnamed in the Affidavit. Probable cause did not exist to search every other individual present at the Club when the\nsearch warrant was executed. When Sheriff Harris and other officers executed the search at the Club, cocaine\nwas found to have been thrown on the floor and the table. Defendants argue that the warrant authorized the\nsearch for cocaine, and, therefore, every individual in the Club was searched because they were authorized to\nsearch where cocaine might be found 00 on the person. Under Defendants' theory, an innocent person who was\n97\nlost and happened to be in the Club to ask for directions or use the telephone would have been strip searched.\nCertainly, our Constitution would not permit such a degrading and humiliating search to be conducted against one\nwho by mere coincidence appeared at the Club under the circumstances previously described. The court finds\nthe argument in which Defendants propose to justify the strip search unpersuasive and unreasonable. A search of\nan individual must be supported by probable cause which is particularized to that person. Ybarra v. Illinois, 444\nU.S. at 91, 100 S.Ct. 338. \"[A] person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity\ndoes not, without more, give rise to probable cause to search that person.\" Id. (citing Sibron v. New York, 392\nU.S. 40, 62-63, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968)).\nDefendants argue that the strip search was also used to ensure the safety of the officers. In support of their\nargument, Defendants allege that Sheriff Harris believed several customers would be armed. Defendants\nconducted a search in March 1994, prior to the one that is the subject of this lawsuit, and a concealed weapon\nwas found. Further, the Defendants argue that oftentimes individuals present at the Club are armed and\ndangerous. An officer is allowed to conduct a pat-down in order to find weapons only when he reasonably\n596 believes that the person is in possession of a weapon. Terry v.*596Ohio, 392 U.S. 1,30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20\nL.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The pat-down is authorized on a showing of reasonable suspicion 00 probable cause is not\n97\nrequired. In Ybarra, every individual present at the tavern was subjected to a pat-down. The court in that case\n\nstated, \"The `narrow scope' of the Terry exception does not permit a frisk for weapons on less than reasonable\nbelief or suspicion directed at the person to be frisked, even though the person happens to be on premises where\nan authorized narcotics search is taking place.\" Id. at 94. With the exception of Karran Brown, Defendants have\npresented no evidence to support that they had a reasonable belief or suspicion that the individuals whom they\nstrip searched were in the possession of a concealed weapon. The only evidence that Defendants have\npresented is that a weapon had been found on the premises before and their belief that the persons who\nfrequented the Club would be in possession of a weapon. \"The fourth amendment does not permit any automatic\nor casual transference of `suspicion.'\" U.S. v. Afanador, 567 F.2d 1325, 1331 (5th Cir.1978).\nKarran Brown, a person described by the Warrant, was also strip searched the night the search warrant was\nexecuted. Plaintiffs argue the Affidavit did not give rise to probable cause as to Karran Brown. The Affidavit states\nthat although the informant did not observe Karran Brown selling rock cocaine, he was present during the\ntransaction. Furthermore, he made no attempt to stop the transaction. As a result, the court concludes that the\nofficers did have probable cause to search Karran Brown for possession of cocaine. Therefore, the strip search\nand detention as conducted toward Karran Brown was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\nC. Unlawful Detention\n1. Allegation of a constitutional right\nUnder the standards previously set forth by the court, the court finds that Plaintiffs' claim of unlawful detention is a\nright protected by the constitution and that such constitutional right was clearly established prior to April 1995. In\napplying the third factor, the court finds that Sheriff Harris is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the\nunlawful detention claims of the Group 1 Plaintiffs who were on the premises when the officers executed the\nsearch warrant. The occupants of a premises being searched for contraband pursuant to a valid warrant may be\nlawfully detained while the search is being conducted. Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587,\n69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981). The search warrant itself provides the \"articulable facts\" necessary to detain a person on\nless than probable cause. The Court reserved the question whether an usually lengthy detention might lead to a\ndifferent conclusion. Summers, 452 U.S. at 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587. This admittedly is a close call here. The court\nhas concerns regarding the length of the detention; nevertheless, the extended detention in this case does not\nabrogate the Sheriff's entitlement to qualified immunity, because officers of reasonable competence could\ndisagree whether detaining Plaintiffs in this case for several hours while the search was being conducted violated\ntheir rights. Accordingly, Sheriff Harris is entitled to qualified immunity on the unlawful detention claims of the\nGroup 1 Plaintiffs.\nThe court reaches a different conclusion with respect to the Group 2 Plaintiffs who were not present when the\nofficers entered the premises. Oscar Williams and Clifford Gibson were removed from their cars on nearby\nstreets and brought back to the Club. James McDonald had just left the Club and was told to return. Leonard\nAvery was taken from his apartment next door and brought in to be strip searched. The search warrant only\n597 authorized the officers to search buildings, vehicles, and structures \"on the *597 premises.\" Sheriff Harris could\nnot seize and detain these Plaintiffs without probable cause, and a reasonably competent officer would not have\ndone so under the circumstances presented in this case. Officers of reasonable competence simply could not\ndisagree on the legality of detaining the Group 2 Plaintiffs.\nD. Invasion of Privacy\nPlaintiffs claim that the strip searches and visual inspection of body cavities were an invasion of their right to\nprivacy because they did not take place in private and members of the opposite sex were present. Defendants\ncontend that the invasion of privacy claims were not pleaded in Plaintiffs' Original Complaint. Plaintiffs filed their\nFirst Amended Original Complaint on March 27, 1998, which contains their invasion of privacy claims. The\nmagistrate judge, however, unfiled Plaintiffs' motion to amend complaint on one occasion and denied Plaintiffs'\nmotion for leave to amend their complaint. See Orders filed April 10, 1998, and June 3, 1998. Plaintiffs did not\nobject to or seek review of the magistrate judge's ruling from the district court. The live pleading before this court\n\nis Plaintiffs' Original Complaint, which does not contain an invasion of privacy claim. Since the invasion of privacy\nclaim has not been pleaded by Plaintiffs', it is not before the court and the court cannot consider it. Defendants\nare therefore entitled to summary judgment on this claim, and it will be dismissed.\nE. Verbal Abuse and Racial Epithets\nPlaintiffs claim that the Defendants engaged in racially motivated verbal harassment in violation of their\nconstitutional rights during the execution of the search warrant. Officers executing the search warrant were\nCaucasian, and all Plaintiffs were African-American. Plaintiffs state that the officers engaged in racially motivated\nverbal abuse and harassment by referring to them as \"niggers\" and \"coons\" during the execution of the warrant.\nPlaintiffs also state that while they were detained, some officers mimicked the sound that a raccoon makes.\nAlthough Plaintiffs set forth these facts in their Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and their\nResponse to Defendants' Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment, they, however, did not assert a\nFourteenth Amendment violation in their Original Complaint. Neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the phrase\n\"equal protection of the laws\" is even mentioned in Plaintiffs' Original Complaint; only the general term \"racial\nslurs\" is used in a conclusory fashion. This is insufficient to state a violation of the Equal Protection Clause under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. To state a claim, a plaintiff must allege that a state officer intentionally discriminated\nagainst him because of membership in a protected class. Johnson v. Morel, 876 F.2d 477, 479 (5th Cir.1989). To\nstate a violation for use of racial epithets, a plaintiff must allege or demonstrate that an official using a racial\nepithet \"engaged in some specific conduct, such as harassment, that deprived [him] of equal protection of the\nlaws.\" Williams v. Bramer, 180 F.3d 699, 707 (5th Cir.1999). In Williams, the plaintiff actually pleaded an equal\nprotection claim in his complaint. Since no Fourteenth Amendment claim was pleaded by Plaintiffs in this case, it\nis not before the court, and the court cannot consider it. Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary\njudgment on this claim.\nEven if Plaintiffs had properly pleaded an equal protection claim, Sheriff Harris would be entitled to qualified\nimmunity because the law was not clearly established with respect to whether the use of a racial slur was enough\nto state a cause of action under the Fourteenth Amendment. In Johnson,\nthe Fifth Circuit did not address the truth of Johnson's equal protection claim or express any opinion on the merits\n598 of the claim regarding the use of racial slurs. Johnson v. Morel, 876 F.2d at 479. What the Fifth Circuit *598 did\nmake clear in July 1999 is that the officer using the racial epithet must have engaged in some conduct, such as\nharassment, that deprived the plaintiff of equal protection of the laws. Williams v. Bramer, 180 F.3d at 707. Prior\nto the Williams decision, the Fifth Circuit had declined to address or resolve this \"thorny\" issue. Id. at 706. \nWilliams clarifies and sets forth the applicable standard necessary to allege or demonstrate an equal protection\nclaim that involves the use of racial slurs. Before this standard, the parameters of this right were not clearly\nestablished or defined. Since these parameters were not clearly defined in April 1995, Sheriff Harris is entitled to\n[3]\nqualified immunity. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate on the basis of qualified immunity.\nF. Municipal Liability\nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to \"produce evidence of, or even identify, a policy or custom of the\nCounty which was the `moving force' behind the alleged violation of their rights.\" Defendants' Supplemental\nMotion for Summary Judgment at p. 17. Plaintiffs contend that the actions which took place on the date in\nquestion were done \"in the presence and pursuant to the direction of Kaufman County Sheriff, Robert Harris.\"\nPlaintiffs' Original Complaint at p. 11. Plaintiffs also have sued Sheriff Harris in his official capacity. Plaintiffs in\nessence are alleging that what took place at the Club was the standard operating procedure of the Kaufman\nCounty Sheriff's Department. In other words, a fair reading of Plaintiffs' Original Complaint is that the County has\na policy, practice, or custom of encouraging, permitting, or authorizing its law enforcement officers to conduct\n[4]\nillegal strip searches and illegal detention of citizens with whom they come into contact.\nPlaintiffs' suit against Sheriff Harris in his official capacity is treated as a claim against Kaufman County, the\ngovernmental entity of which Harris is an employee, representative, or official. See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21,\n25, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991); Brooks v. George County, 84 F.3d 157, 165 (5th Cir.),cert. denied,\n\n519 U.S. 948, 117 S.Ct. 359, 136 L.Ed.2d 251 (1996). A governmental entity can be sued and subjected to\nmonetary damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 only if its official policy or custom causes a\nperson to be deprived of a federally protected right. Board of the County Commissioners v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397,\n599 403, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997); Monell v. Department of Social*599Services of City of New York,\n436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). A governmental entity cannot be liable for civil rights\nviolations under a theory of respondent superior or vicarious liability. Id. See also Baskin v. Parker, 602 F.2d\n1205, 1208 (5th Cir.1979). Official policy is defined as:\n1. A policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision that is officially adopted and promulgated\nby the [county] lawmaking officers or by an official to whom the lawmakers have delegated policy-\nmaking authority; or\n2. A persistent, widespread practice of [county] officials or employees which, although not\nauthorized by officially adopted and promulgated policy, is so common and well-settled as to\nconstitute a custom that fairly represents [county] policy. Actual or constructive knowledge of such\ncustom must be attributable to the governing body of the [county] or to an official to whom that\nbody had delegated policy-making authority.\nWebster v. City of Houston, 735 F.2d 838, 841 (5th Cir.1984); Bennett v. City of Slidell, 735 F.2d 861, 862 (5th\nCir.1984). A plaintiff must identify the policy, connect the policy to the governmental entity itself and show that his\ninjury was incurred because of the application of that specific policy. Bennett v. City of Slidell, 728 F.2d 762, 767\n(5th Cir.1984),cert. denied,472 U.S. 1016, 105 S.Ct. 3476, 87 L.Ed.2d 612 (1985). A plaintiff must establish that\nthe governmental entity through its deliberate conduct was the moving force behind the injury or harm suffered\nand must establish a direct causal link between the governmental entity's action and the deprivation of a federally\nprotected right. Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. at 403-04, 117 S.Ct. 1382.\nLiability must rest on official policy, meaning the governmental entity's policy, and not the policy of an individual\nofficial. Bennett, 728 F.2d at 769. The official complained of must possess\n... final authority to establish [county] policy with respect to the action ordered .... The official must\nalso be responsible for establishing final government policy respecting such activity before the\n[county] can be held liable .... [W]hether an official had final policymaking authority is a question of\nstate law.\nPembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 481-482, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986). An employee,\nagency, or board of a governmental entity is not a policymaker unless the governmental entity, through its\nlawmakers, has delegated exclusive policymaking authority to that employee agency or board and cannot review\nthe action or decision of the employee, agency or board. See St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 127, 108\nS.Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988); Worsham v. City of Pasadena, 881 F.2d 1336, 1340-41 (5th Cir.1989).\nPlaintiffs allege that Kaufman County should be liable for the allegedly illegal conduct on April 21, 1995, the day\nthe search warrant was executed at the Club. Plaintiffs contend that Sheriff Harris is the person with the\nresponsibility for final decision-making authority in the area of law enforcement and the execution of hazardous\nwarrants. Furthermore, his department does not have a written policy which covers hazardous warrants;\ntherefore, according to Plaintiffs, the policy must be derived from training and actual execution of the Warrant.\nThe court first looks to state law in order to determine if Sheriff Harris possesses final decision-making authority\nwith respect to law enforcement decisions. \"[I]t has long been recognized that, in Texas, the county sheriff is the\ncounty's final policymaker in the area of law enforcement.\" Colle v. Brazos County Texas, 981 F.2d 237, 244 (5th\nCir.1993)(quoting Turner v. Upton County, 915 F.2d 133, 136 (5th Cir.1990)); see also Familias Unidas v. Briscoe,\n600 619 F.2d 391, 404 (5th Cir.1980). By virtue of being elected to *600 office, Sheriff Harris has the exclusive\npolicymaking authority in the area of law enforcement, and no Kaufman County body or official can review the\naction or decisions of Sheriff Harris in the area of law enforcement. The court, therefore, concludes that Sheriff\nHarris is the final policymaker in the area of law enforcement for Kaufman County.\n\nSheriff Harris coordinated the execution of the warrant, was physically present, and was the ranking officer when\nthe search warrant was executed. He stated in his deposition, that Kaufman County did not have a written policy\nfor the execution of hazardous warrants. He also stated:\nIf you were there and you were white or green or yellow or purple you would have been strip\nsearched. If there was an individual that was 00 regardless of his color that was in this particular\n97\nplaces, as much narcotics as we found in plain view, if he were naive enough to stay there, he\nprobably would have been searched.\nDeposition of Sheriff Harris at 139. The decision and act of Sheriff Harris to strip search all of the Plaintiffs\nbecause of their mere presence at the Club and to detain the Plaintiffs up to four hours while the strip searches\ntook place was the official policy, practice, or custom of Kaufman County, because Sheriff Harris was the final\npolicymaker in the area of law enforcement. This conclusion is simply unavoidable. Plaintiffs have produced\nsufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning their claim that they were injured as a\nresult of an unconstitutional policy, practice, or custom of Kaufman County. There is a material fact question\nwhether the policy was adopted with \"`deliberate indifference' to its known or obvious consequences\" and\nwhether the policy was the \"`moving force' behind the constitutional violation.\" See Snyder v. Trepagnier, 142\nF.3d 791, 795 (5th Cir. 1998). The question is whether Kaufman County has a policy or practice of authorizing,\nencouraging, or permitting its law enforcement officers to conduct illegal strip searches and illegal detentions of\ncitizens with whom they come into contact. Kaufman County is not entitled to summary judgment on the issue of\ncounty liability.\nIV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons stated herein, the court grants Defendants' Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment\nregarding Plaintiffs' claims of invasion of privacy and racially motivated verbal harassment. The court denies\nDefendants' motion insofar as it relates to Plaintiffs' claims of an illegal strip search, as Plaintiffs have\ndemonstrated or raised a genuine issue of material fact that Defendant Harris is not entitled to qualified immunity\non this claim. The court also denies the motion insofar as it relates to the Group 2 Plaintiffs with respect to the\nunlawful detention claim, because these Plaintiffs have demonstrated or raised a genuine issue of material fact\nthat Defendant Harris is not entitled to qualified immunity. The court grants the Defendants' motion on all of\nKarran Brown's claims. Plaintiffs' claims of invasion of privacy and verbal harassment based on race and the\nGroup 1 Plaintiffs claims based on unlawful detention are dismissed with prejudice.\nThe matters remaining for the disposition are those claims on which summary judgment was denied by this\nopinion and Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief regarding Defendants' alleged violation of Article I, Section 9 of\nthe Texas Constitution as stated in the court's order of November 12, 1998.\n[1] A description of each \"Group\" of Plaintiffs is provided at the end of Section I of this opinion.\n[2] Plaintiff David Brown was dismissed without prejudice on April 28, 1998; Plaintiff John Jackson was dismissed\nwithout prejudice on May 21, 1998; and Plaintiff Sylvester Lewis was dismissed with prejudice on October 14,\n1998.\n[3] Sheriff Harris is put on notice that such conduct today, in conjunction with what occurred during the execution\nof the search warrant, would be actionable. The court notes that, based on the current record, Defendants have\nreally not denied that these racial slurs were used. If the evidence at trial establishes that the racial slurs were\nused, that they would be used in this day and time by law enforcement officials is sad and inexcusable. Use of\nsuch deplorable language only breeds contempt and disrespect for law enforcement officials. The court hopes\nthat this was an isolated incident and not a presage of how the Kaufman County Sheriff's Department treats its\nAfrican-American citizens.\n[4] Arguably, a fair reading of Plaintiffs' Original Complaint leaves one with the understanding that Plaintiffs are\nalso alleging that Kaufman County has a policy of permitting, allowing, or authorizing its officers (1) to use\n\nexcessive force against citizens with whom they come into contact, (2) to use racially charged language during\nthe execution of law enforcement activities, and (3) to invade the privacy of its citizens during the execution of law\nenforcement activities. The court need not address these matters, however, because the court has found that the\nunderlying issue is not before the court or that there is no underlying violation regarding these alleged policies.\nWhen there is no underlying violation, the policy becomes irrelevant and is \"quite beside the point.\" Los Angeles\nv. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 799, 106 S.Ct. 1571, 89 L.Ed.2d 806 (1986); see also Saenz v. Heldenfels Bros., Inc.,\n183 F.3d 389, 392-3 (5th Cir.1999). In other words, if a person suffers no constitutional injury at the hands of the\nmunicipal officer, the alleged unconstitutional policy could not have been the cause of any harm to that person.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Brumley (collectively \"plaintiffs\") appeal the\ndistrict court's denial of their unlawful detention, invasion of privacy, and oral harassment claims in their § 1983\nsuit against Sheriff Robert Harris (\"Harris\") and Kaufman County, Texas (\"the County\"), (collectively,\n\"defendants\"). Defendants cross-appeal the district court's judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their claims for illegal\nstrip search, municipal liability against the county, nominal and punitive damages against Harris in his personal\ncapacity, and state constitutional declarative relief. For the following reasons, we affirm.\nI. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\nIn April of 1995, Sheriff Harris obtained a search warrant, based on information he received from a confidential\ninformant, for a night club called the \"Classic Club\" in Terrell, Texas (the \"Club\"). The affidavit used to secure the\n695 warrant identified five individuals suspected of dealing crack cocaine, none of whom are the plaintiffs here, *695\nand included as suspects \"all other person or persons whose names, identities, and descriptions are unknown to\nthe affiant.\" The warrant itself, however, only authorized the police to \"enter the suspected place described in [the\naffidavit] and to there search for the personal property described ... and to seize same and to arrest and bring\nbefore [the magistrate] each suspected party named in [the affidavit].\"\nAt about 9:45 p.m. the same day, Harris led a contingent of approximately forty (40) officers to the Club to\n[1]\nexecute the \"hazardous\" warrant.  Although some individuals were able to run away, and others outside the\npremises allegedly hurled bottles and rocks at the officers, the law enforcement personnel were able to secure\nthe outer perimeter of the search area, which included the Club's building and parking lot, and the entire city\nblock up to the roadway. On entering the Club, the officers noticed drugs on the floors and tables.\nPlaintiffs Cecil Jackson and L.B. Brumley were inside the Club; plaintiff Thomas Gene Brown was outside, but\nwhen he repeatedly attempted to gain admittance, an officer arrested him and took him inside to be searched.\nThe police detained approximately 100 people, including plaintiffs, inside the Club for about three hours. During\nthat time, officers conducted a pat-down search, strip search, and warrants check on each individual there.\nAlthough strip searches were not part of any written policy concerning the execution of hazardous warrants,\n\nHarris testified that it was his standard policy to conduct a strip search on each person within the search area,\nwith or without individualized probable cause. Also, pursuant to this \"policy,\" the officers rehandcuffed plaintiffs\n(and all other detainees) and continued to detain them after the strip searches until the entire search of the Club\nand all occupants had been completed. Brumley got obstreperous after he was strip searched and was arrested\nfor disorderly conduct.\nThree years later, 17 individuals brought suit under § 1983, claiming that Harris and the County violated their\n[2]\nFourth Amendment rights by engaging in an illegal strip search, unlawful detention and oral harassment.  Four\nplaintiffs were dismissed, and 10 others settled their claims. The three remaining plaintiffs (plaintiffs-appellants\nherein) unsuccessfully attempted to amend their complaint, in part to include an invasion-of-privacy claim.\nAt the summary judgment stage, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on (1) the\nunlawful detention claims of those plaintiffs inside the Club when the premises were secured; (2) plaintiffs'\ninvasion of privacy claims; and (3) plaintiffs' verbal harassment claims. The court denied defendants' summary\njudgment motion on (1) plaintiffs' illegal strip search claim; (2) the unlawful detention claims of plaintiffs who were\n696 not originally in the Club, but were brought in only after the premises were *696 secured; and (3) plaintiffs' policy\nclaims against Kaufman County.\nAfter conducting a bench trial, the district court concluded that (1) Harris had conducted an unconstitutional strip\nsearch of plaintiffs, and he is not entitled to qualified immunity because the rule of law prohibiting these searches\nwas clearly established at the time, making Harris's conduct objectively unreasonable; (2) Harris is entitled to\n[3]\nqualified immunity on Brown's illegal detention claim, the only detention claim surviving summary judgment;\nand (3) Kaufman County is liable for Harris's conduct because Harris is a policymaker whose actions (specifically,\nhis orally established policy of conducting strip searches irrespective of the absence of reasonable suspicion) had\nbeen the moving force behind the violation of plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\nBased on these rulings, the court awarded each plaintiff \"nominal damages\" of $100, and punitive damages of\n$15,000 against Harris in his individual capacity. The court also awarded plaintiffs declaratory relief, decreeing\nthat Harris and the County had violated plaintiffs' rights under Article I, section 9 of the Texas Constitution. The\n[4]\ncourt rejected plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief.  Both plaintiffs and defendants timely filed notices of appeal.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. Standard of Review\n[5]\nWe review the district court's summary judgment decision de novo.  Summary judgment is only proper if there\n[6]\nis no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  To\ndetermine whether there are any material factual issues, we consult the applicable substantive law to define\nwhich issues are material, and then consider the evidence relevant to those issues in the light most favorable to\n[7]\nthe non-moving party.\nWe review the district court's bench trial conclusions of law de novo, and findings of fact for clear error. Finally,\n[8]\nwe review punitive damages awards for abuse of discretion only.\nB. Parties' Contentions\nBecause the district court addressed plaintiffs' claims at both the summary judgment and trial stages of the\n697 litigation, and because the parties appeal different aspects of the judgments rendered, we *697 briefly summarize\nthe parties' contentions on appeal in the interest of clarity.\nPlaintiffs make four claims (1) Harris supervised an unlawful detention, which was objectively unreasonable,\npretermitting qualified immunity; (2) Harris's search method amounted to an invasion of plaintiffs' privacy; (3) the\nofficers use of racial epithets violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights; and (4) the County is liable for the\n\nconstitutional violations caused by Harris's conduct. In short, plaintiffs contest essentially all of the district court's\nsummary judgment holdings adverse to them.\nFor their part, defendants argue that (1) within the context of executing a hazardous search warrant, it was proper\nfor the officers under Harris's command to conduct strip searches; but even if plaintiffs' rights were violated,\nHarris deserves qualified immunity; (2) Harris acted reasonably in detaining plaintiffs until the completion of the\nentire search of the Club; but even if Harris acted unlawfully, he is entitled to qualified immunity; (3) the district\ncourt properly dismissed plaintiffs' claims of invasion of privacy for their failure to plead such claims; (4) the\ndistrict court properly denied plaintiffs' claims of oral harassment because plaintiffs failed to plead an equal\nprotection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment; (5) the district court erred in assessing nominal (insisting that\n$100 per plaintiff is not nominal) and punitive damages; (6) the district court erred in finding that defendants\nviolated the Texas Constitution; and (7) the County is not liable for conduct that does not amount to a\nconstitutional violation.\nC. Qualified Immunity Standard\nTo prevail in a § 1983 suit, a plaintiff must overcome an officer's defense of qualified immunity. Last term, in Hope\n[9]\nv. Pelzer, the Supreme Court rendered its most recent articulation of this standard,  which we subsequently\n[10] [11]\nadopted.  To determine whether relief is appropriate, the court must undertake a two-step analysis.  First,\n[12]\nthe court must evaluate whether a \"plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation.\"  We\naddress this inquiry in greater detail in connection with each of the contested constitutional claims.\nSecond, if a constitutional violation is found to have occurred, the court must determine whether the defendant's\nactions violated \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\n[13]\nknown.\"  The Hope Court reiterated the standard for a constitutional right to be clearly established:\n[I]ts contours \"must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is\n698 doing violates that right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity \n*698 unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful.... but it is to say that in\n[14]\nthe light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\"\nIn Hope, the Court clarified that the factual situation from which the pre-existing constitutional right developed\n[15]\ndoes not have to be \"fundamentally similar\" to the one before a court when addressing qualified immunity.\nRather, qualified immunity can be overcome as long as \"`prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the\n[16]\nconduct then at issue violated constitutional rights.'\"  The Court concluded that \"officials can still be on notice\n[17]\nthat their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.\"\nThe appropriate inquiry, therefore, is \"whether the state of the law [at the time of the violation] gave [defendants]\n[18]\nfair warning that their alleged treatment of [plaintiffs] was unconstitutional.\"\nD. Unlawful Strip Search\n1. Whether Harris's conduct violated the Fourth Amendment\nOn appeal, defendants argue that, within the context of executing a hazardous search warrant, it was proper for\nHarris to conduct strip searches of plaintiffs. In Ybarra v. Illinois, the Supreme Court addressed the search of a\nbar patron, which occurred during the execution of a search warrant that authorized police to search the Aurora\n[19]\nTavern and a bartender named \"Greg\" for heroin and other contraband.  The Court accepted that police had a\nvalid warrant to search the premises, but concluded that \"it gave them no authority whatever to invade the\n[20]\nconstitutional protections possessed individually by the tavern's customers.\"  Reasoning further, the Court\nstated:\n\n[A] person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not,\nwithout more, give rise to probable cause to search that person .... Where the standard is\nprobable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause\nparticularized with respect to that person. This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by\nsimply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize\n[21]\nanother or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.\n699 The Court also concluded that even the initial frisk of the patron, Ybarra, much *699 less his subsequent search,\n[22]\nwas unjustified.  Although Terry v. Ohio created an exception to the probable cause requirement, allowing\npolice officers to protect themselves by conducting a patdown of a suspect, the Ybarra court held that \"[t]he\n`narrow scope' of the Terry exception does not permit a frisk for weapons on less than reasonable belief or\nsuspicion directed at the person to be frisked, even though that person happens to be on premises where an\n[23]\nauthorized narcotics search is taking place.\"\nHere, the district court concluded, relying primarily on Ybarra, that Harris's strip search of plaintiffs violated their\nFourth Amendment rights. On appeal, Harris and the County contend that the violent history of the Club created\nexigent circumstances, which threatened officer safety and thus justified the strip search of the plaintiffs. In\ncontrast to Ybarra, they argue, the exigent circumstances in this case presented a situation in which there was\n\"more\" than plaintiffs' \"mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity.\"\nAlthough the discrete facts of this case differ from Ybarra, those differences are not sufficient to create a\nmeaningful distinction. Ybarra squarely held that in premises searches like this one, police must have either\narticulable reasonable suspicion to frisk an individual or probable cause to search him. The record evidence, in\nparticular Harris's own testimony, reflects that, vis-à-vis the plaintiffs, the police lacked even reasonable\nsuspicion. None of the plaintiffs was named in the warrant, and Harris offered no reasonable belief that the\nplaintiffs in particular were armed or engaged in criminal activity. Even if, based solely on the Club's history, it had\nbeen reasonable for Harris to suspect that plaintiffs were armed or carrying drugs, searching them would still\n[24]\nhave been unlawful: Ybarra reiterated that the Terry-style search is limited to a frisk for weapons.  Harris's\nofficers frisked the plaintiffs, but found no evidence of weapons, drugs or contraband to ripen into the probable\ncause required for a full-blown search. Harris testified that the officers conducting the search had no\nindividualized probable cause as to any of the plaintiffs. Instead, he stated only that there was \"probable cause to\nbelieve that everyone in there may have had drugs on them.\" Finally, as the district court reasonably explained,\nthe intrusiveness of the search outweighed the legitimate law enforcement interests in protection and safety,\nbecause the officers had already handcuffed and patted down the plaintiffs before forcing them to undergo strip\n[25]\nsearches.\n700 *700 Neither of the other two potential justifications for the strip search 00 arrest or identity in a warrant 00 mitigate\n97 97\nthe unlawfulness of the search. First, although two of the plaintiffs, Brumley and Brown, were arrested that\nevening, neither of the arrests justified strip searches under the applicable law. Brumley was arrested for\ndisorderly conduct after he was strip searched; thus his post hoc arrest could not have justified the search. Brown\nwas arrested before the search, but for attempting to enter the Club (claiming he owned it) in spite of an officer's\norder to leave the area.\nWe have allowed strip searches in custodial situations but, consistently, not when the suspect has committed\n[26]\nonly a minor offense and there exists no reasonable suspicion that he might possess weapons or contraband.\nAlthough Brown was attempting to enter a Club in which drugs were found, defendants offer no evidence for\nsuspecting that he possessed weapons or contraband. Indeed, Harris admitted that he had no probable cause\ntoward Brown; the arresting officer testified that he had no suspicion that Brown was carrying weapons; and prior\nto the strip search the officers took everything out of Brown's pockets, revealing no weapons or drugs, and\nthereby dispelling any suspicion of illegal activity. As a result, the subsequent strip search, after reasonable\nsuspicion had failed to mature into probable cause, was unreasonably intrusive.\nSecond, the affidavit that Harris filed to obtain the warrant was insufficient to justify a strip search of plaintiffs. The\naffidavit submitted for the warrant included as suspects \"all other person or persons whose names, identities, and\n\ndescriptions are unknown to the affiant.\" The warrant itself only authorized the police to \"enter the suspected\nplace described in [the affidavit] and to there search for the personal property described ... and to seize same and\nto arrest and bring before [the magistrate] each suspected party named in [the affidavit]\" (emphasis added). None\nof the plaintiffs was named as a suspect in the affidavit. Furthermore, as Ybarra confirmed, because the Fourth\n[27]\nAmendment requires particularity, \"`open-ended' or `general' warrants are constitutionally prohibited.\"  To\nconstrue this warrant as authorizing a general search of any person found in the Club would sanction exactly the\ntype of general warrant that the Constitution forbids.\nIn sum, the strip search of the plaintiffs was unlawful because Harris lacked probable cause toward each of them.\n2. Whether the law was \"clearly established\"\nThe district court concluded that \"no reasonable officer could have believed that conducting a strip search in\nthese circumstances, without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, was objectively reasonable.\" The court\n[28]\nnoted that both Ybarra and Watt v. Richardson Police Department  clearly established that strip searches\nconducted without individualized reasonable suspicion or probable cause are unlawful. On appeal, Harris\ncontends that reasonable officers could have disagreed about the legality of the strip search because of the\n[29]\nhazardous conditions surrounding the execution of the search warrant.\n701 *701Hope instructs that once it is clear that a constitutional violation has occurred, courts must examine whether\nthe state of the law at the time gave the defendants fair warning that their behavior toward the plaintiffs was\nunlawful. In this case, we agree with the district court that Ybarra and our case law on strip searches provided fair\nwarning to Harris that his conduct was unlawful. Ybarra addressed a situation substantially similar to the one\nhere, and explicitly held that officers must have reasonable suspicion to conduct a frisk or individualized probable\ncause to conduct a lawful search. Even accepting that there were aspects of this warrant's search that made it\nmore hazardous than the one conducted in Ybarra, or made it more likely that multiple persons would be in\npossession of drugs, none of these extenuating circumstances created probable cause or reasonable suspicion\n[30]\n\"particularized with respect to [plaintiffs].\"  And even if hazardous circumstances had given rise to reasonable\nsuspicion that plaintiffs, by being present, might have possessed weapons or contraband, Harris should have\nknown that his officers were limited to a patdown of each plaintiff. Thus, to the extent this case differs factually\nfrom Ybarra, it still fits comfortably under the general rule promulgated by the Supreme Court in that case.\nIndeed, Harris's declaration that \"we did have probable cause to believe that everyone in [the Club] may have\nhad drugs on them\" demonstrates his unjustified disregard or deliberate ignorance of the rule articulated by the \nYbarra court.\nIn addition, our prohibition of strip searches in other contexts presented more than fair warning at the time that\nthe strip searches at issue here were illegal. In Stewart v. Lubbock County, we employed the test articulated in \nBell v. Wolfish, balancing law enforcement interests in the search against the level of invasion of personal rights\n[31]\ncaused by the search.  We concluded that the strip search policy at issue there violated the Fourth\nAmendment because it applied to minor offenders about whom the police had no reasonable suspicion of\n[32]\npossessing weapons or contraband.  Similarly, in Watt v. Richardson Police Department, we recognized that\neven though strip searches of inmates were often allowed to maintain institutional security, when an arrestee's\noffense is minor, his criminal history innocuous or ancient, and his personal characteristics at odds with\n[33]\nreasonable fears about prison security, the strip search is illegal.\nUnlike both Stewart and Watt, this case concerns individuals outside the prison context, thus individuals toward\nwhom the police had even less individualized reasonable suspicion or probable cause 00 none, to be precise.\n97\nThus, if any law enforcement interest existed at all, it concerned only officer safety, not prison security. After\nhandcuffing and patting down the plaintiffs here, however, even this law enforcement interest ceased to exist. On\nappeal, Harris and the County repeatedly encant the hazardous conditions of the search, yet Harris admits that\nhe had no individualized probable cause that any of the plaintiffs had weapons, drugs or contraband.\nFurthermore, even though Brown was arrested before he was strip searched, he was arrested because he\ninterfered with the duties of a public servant, not because of any probable cause or reasonable suspicion related\n\n702 to drugs or weapons. To the *702 extent the police were legitimately worried about their safety in regard to Brown\nor any other individuals before or during the searches, those concerns surely evanesced once the officers\nhandcuffed and patted down the plaintiffs. At that point, the law enforcement interests were substantially less\nsignificant than those in either Stewart or Watt. Finally, weighed against this interest, the invasion of personal\n[34]\nrights caused by the strip searches here are at least if not more intrusive than in either Stewart or Watt.  In\nshort, Stewart and Watt also provided fair warning to Harris that law enforcement interests in safety did not justify\nthe extreme intrusiveness of strip searches especially once the plaintiffs were handcuffed and patted down.\nIn sum, Ybarra, Stewart and Watt dispel any doubt that the law was clearly established by the night of the raid in\nApril, 1995, that strip searching individuals, about whom the police had no individualized probable cause of\nweapon or drug possession, was unlawful. This in turn precludes Harris's entitlement to qualified immunity.\nE. Unlawful Detention\n1. Whether Harris's conduct violated the Fourth Amendment\nThe district court rejected Brumley's and Jackson's unlawful detention claims at summary judgment and rejected\nBrown's claim after the bench trial, all on qualified immunity grounds. The court concluded that despite its\nreservations about the length of detention, under Michigan v. Summers it was not objectively unreasonable for\nthe officers to detain all those present in the Club, including plaintiffs, until completion of the search. Although\nBrown was not on the premises when the search began, the court nonetheless also concluded that his detention\nwas not objectively unreasonable, inasmuch as Brown had voluntarily come within the search perimeter by\ninsisting on entering the Club, despite warnings to leave the area.\nOn appeal, plaintiffs claim that the court erred in granting summary judgment against Brumley and Jackson, and\njudgment against Brown, on their detention claims. Plaintiffs contend that there was no justifiable reason to detain\nplaintiffs after they were strip searched and cleared of outstanding warrants. Their continued, re-handcuffed\ndetention, they argue, was not the least intrusive method available to the police, and thus constituted unlawful\n[35]\ndetention.\n[36]\nIn Michigan v. Summers, the Supreme Court reiterated the approach by which a seizure must be analyzed.\nThere is a \"general rule that every arrest, and every seizure having the essential attributes of a formal arrest, is\n[37]\nunreasonable unless it is supported by probable cause.\"  This rule is tempered, however, by the \"ultimate\n[38]\nstandard of reasonableness embodied in the Fourth Amendment.\"  Thus, some seizures, even though longer\n703 than momentary, \"constitute such limited intrusions on the personal security of those *703 detained and are\njustified by such substantial law enforcement interests that they may be made on less than probable cause, so\n[39]\nlong as police have an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity.\"  Such intrusions are \"not confined to\nthe momentary, on-the-street detention accompanied by a frisk for weapons,\" as was involved in Terry v. Ohio.\n[40]\nFor determining whether a seizure falls into this exception to the general rule, the Court set out a familiar\n[41]\nbalancing test, which weighed the character of the intrusion against the character of the justification.  In \nSummers, the Court addressed whether police who were about to execute a warrant to search a house acted\npermissibly when they detained an individual who was emerging from the house and who turned out to be the\nowner, while they conducted the search. The Court found the intrusion substantially less invasive than an arrest\nbecause (1) the police conducted the search pursuant to a valid warrant, which already authorized a substantial,\nand arguably more intrusive, invasion of privacy of the detainee's home; (2) the officers were unlikely to prolong\nthe detention to gain more information because they were primarily seeking information from the search itself;\nand (3) the detention was inside the detainee's home instead of the police station, thereby minimizing the public\n[42]\nstigma associated with the event.\n\nIn comparison, the character of the justification is measured by both law enforcement interests and the nature of\n[43]\nthe articulable facts supporting the detention.  The Court identified three law enforcement interests, all of\nwhich supported the detention at issue: (1) preventing the flight of the suspect; (2) minimizing the risk of harm to\nthe police; and (3) facilitating the orderly completion of the search by having the occupant of the premises\n[44]\npresent.  Furthermore, the existence of the valid search warrant, issued by a neutral magistrate to search a\nhome for criminal activity, established probable cause that someone in the home was committing a crime, which\n[45]\nin turn provided justification for detaining the home's occupant.  The Court concluded:\nIf the evidence that a citizen's residence is harboring contraband is sufficient to persuade a judicial\nofficer that an invasion of the citizen's privacy is justified, it is constitutionally reasonable to require\nthat citizen to remain while officers of the law execute a valid warrant to search his home. Thus,\nfor Fourth Amendment purposes, we hold that a warrant to search for contraband founded on\nprobable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the\n[46]\npremises while a proper search is conducted.\nIn Heitschmidt v. City of Houston, we limited Summers to its facts. We concluded that Summers only holds that\n\"police have limited authority to detain the occupant of a house without probable cause while the premises is\nsearched, when the detention is neither prolonged nor unduly intrusive, and when police are executing a validly\n[47]\nexecuted search warrant for contraband.\"\n704 *704Heitschmidt involved a police search of a house in which the occupant, Heitschmidt, had little known\n[48]\nconnection at the time of the search to the criminal activity for which the search warrant was procured.\nAlthough the police had a warrant to search the house, we reasoned that the intrusiveness of the detention was\nsubstantial because Heitschmidt was allegedly handcuffed on the street, pushed into the trunk of a car, and then\n[49]\ndetained for over four hours without a bathroom break.  In comparison, we found the justifications for\ndetention unpersuasive, because there was little evidence Heitschmidt would flee, or that such restraint was\n[50]\nrequired for police protection.  We reasoned further that a search warrant is a weaker basis for detention when\npolice know the occupant's identity and have no reasonable basis for suspecting that that person is engaged in\n[51]\ncriminal activity.  Finally, in contrast to Summers, we noted that the search warrant was for evidence of the\n[52]\nother house occupant's prostitution ring, not specifically for contraband.  On the basis of this analysis, we\nconcluded that Heitschmidt had adequately alleged a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, and that the right\n[53]\nalleged was clearly established. We therefore held the officers' conduct to be objectively unreasonable.\nIn this case, Harris and the County argue that the detention was reasonable. The County avers that the plaintiffs\nwere allowed to move around and use the bathroom after their individual searches, and that the three hour\ndetention was reasonable because there were 100 people on the premises. Defendants also argue that the\nviolent history of the Club, and Harris's fear that those released early would return with firearms to harm the\nofficers, justified the lengthy detention.\nThere is no question that the seizure of plaintiffs had many of the essential attributes of an arrest. We therefore\nmust determine whether the law enforcement interests outweighed plaintiffs' interest against intrusion as\narticulated in Summers and Heitschmidt. We begin by noting that some factual details of this case distinguish it\nfrom our narrow interpretation of Summers (1) Plaintiffs were customers at a public commercial establishment,\nnot occupants of a residence; and (2) plaintiffs were subjected to unlawful, unduly intrusive strip searches during\n[54]\nthe warrant-authorized search of the premises.\nFurthermore, when we apply the full Summers balancing test, we confirm that the extended detention of plaintiffs\n705 was *705 indeed unlawful. The intrusiveness of the detention was much greater than in Summers. Although\nHarris had a valid warrant to search the Club, he went well beyond the limits of that warrant, conducting highly\nintrusive strip searches of plaintiffs, about whom he had neither individualized reasonable suspicion nor probable\ncause. After failing to uncover contraband or weapons on the person of plaintiffs, Harris nevertheless detained\nthem and kept them handcuffed for the remainder of the three-hour search. Because this was a public\n\nestablishment and not a private residence, moreover, plaintiffs had no reason to remain at the Club during the\n[55]\nsearch.  The illegal strip searches of plaintiffs and all other occupants added to the prolongation of the\ndetention and demonstrated Harris's intent to gain more information than he was authorized to retrieve. Last, the\npublic stigma associated with the detention was greater than in either Summers or Heitschmidt, because the\ndetention lasted three hours in a public venue, not in the obscurity of a residence.\nOn the opposite side of the scale are the law enforcement interests and articulable facts supporting plaintiffs'\ndetention. The proffered law enforcement interests in preventing flight and maintaining safety here are\nquestionable. Once the premises had been secured and the officers had strip-searched and warrant-checked the\nplaintiffs, uncovering no evidence to create probable cause, there was no need to prevent their flight and no\nidentifiable fear that, if released, plaintiffs would return to inflict harm.\nIn addition, there are no articulable facts that provide valid support for the extended detention of plaintiffs.\nAlthough Harris had a warrant to search the Club, and on that basis, had general, non-specific probable cause\nthat persons known or unknown might be committing crimes in the Club, the warrant only permitted the search of\nthe premises and the five individuals named in the affidavit. Because the warrant named specific individuals and \ndid not explicitly allow the more general search requested in Harris's affidavit, the judicially-prescribed justification\nfor the extended detention of plaintiffs was far less substantial than in Summers. Once the police had patted\ndown, strip searched, and conducted a warrants check, moreover, the police surely had no articulable and\nindividualized suspicion to justify further detention of the plaintiffs.\nNeither Brumley's arrest for disorderly conduct during the period of the detention nor Brown's arrest for interfering\nwith the duties of a public servant alters our conclusion that the extended detention was unlawful. Brumley's\narrest for disorderly conduct occurred after the search and after a period, subsequent to the search, during which\nBrumley was handcuffed and forced to lie face-down on the ground outside the Club. We cannot conclude that\nhis further detention was permissible on the basis of the arrest, because such a conclusion would effectively\nallow the police to create a potential threat to their safety through unconstitutional, provocative conduct, and then\nrely on that manufactured threat to perpetrate additional constitutional violations. Furthermore, although Brown\nhad shown a willingness to ignore police orders, he had only sought admittance because of his family relationship\n706 to the Club's owner. Thus, his arrest had nothing to do with the search of the Club. *706 He was not present at\nthe Club when the raid began, and the officer who arrested him testified that he had no probable cause to believe\nthat Brown was carrying a weapon. In fact, his \"arrest\" lasted only for the duration of the search and he was\nnever booked or incarcerated.\nHarris and the County nevertheless persist in urging that the detention of plaintiffs was necessary for an orderly\ncompletion of the search of the Club, and was reasonable both because of the number of persons present at the\nClub and because of Harris's fear that those released would return armed. We are aware of the circumstances\nthat the police believed they were actually facing when they executed their search warrant. The history of\nviolence and drug use certainly gave Harris reason to worry about the safety of his officers. The nature of the\nsearch and the number of persons present also made the search of the Club factually distinct from the average\nsearch of small groups or a single person in a less volatile venue. Given the number of persons inside the Club,\ndetention of plaintiffs for as long as reasonably required for the police to search the premises and to search and\n[56]\narrest the individuals named in the warrant may have been permissible.  What occurred, however, was a\ndetention that lasted much longer than necessary specifically because of the pervasive and protracted illegal strip\nsearching that occurred. We cannot credit an argument that such a lengthy detention, including the time that\nelapsed both before and after plaintiffs were strip searched, was justifiable simply because the police elected to\nstrip search scores of other Club customers.\nIn sum, the exception carved out in Summers, and shaped in Heitschmidt, is inapplicable here. Because the law\nenforcement interest proffered does not justify such lengthy, public intrusions on plaintiffs, we hold the prolonged\ndetention of plaintiffs to be unlawful.\n\n2. Whether the law was \"clearly established\"\nAlthough we hold today that the prolonged detention of plaintiffs was unlawful, we nonetheless agree with the\ndistrict court that qualified immunity shields Harris from liability. Even though Summers does not sanction Harris's\nconduct, neither did it establish a clear rule warning defendants that such conduct was illegal. The Court only\nhinted that \"[a]lthough special circumstances, or possibly a prolonged detention, might lead to a different\nconclusion in an unusual case, we are persuaded that this routine detention of residents of a house while it was\n[57]\nbeing searched for contraband pursuant to a valid warrant is not such a case.\"  Furthermore, Heitschmidt,\nwhich clarifies our views regarding these types of detentions, was not decided until after Harris's search of the\nClub.\n707 *707 In the instant case, there is no doubt that the illegal strip search of plaintiffs corrupted the legality of their\ndetention by extending it unnecessarily. Still, the objective unreasonableness of Harris's conduct in ordering a\nstrip search of plaintiffs does not automatically make his conduct in unduly detaining plaintiffs for the duration of\nthe search objectively unreasonable in and of itself. Whereas Ybarra established the clear rule that any full\nsearch of plaintiffs required individualized probable cause, Summers allows a seizure without probable cause\nwhen the proper balance is struck between law enforcement and personal security interests. Thus, Summers left\nthe state of the law more ambiguous as to what constituted an unlawful detention in a premises search like the\none here. In other words, under the law as it existed in April, 1995, Harris had fair warning that his generalized\nlaw enforcement safety interests did not justify strip searching plaintiffs; the law was less clear about whether\nthese same interests were sufficient to permit detention of plaintiffs until the completion of the otherwise unlawful\nsearch. We agree with the district court's grant of qualified immunity on plaintiffs' unlawful detention claims.\nF. Invasion of Privacy\nThe district court rejected plaintiffs' invasion of privacy claim on summary judgment because the then-current\npleading before the court, the original complaint, did not state this claim. The magistrate judge had 00 in his words\n97\n00 \"unfiled\" plaintiffs' amended complaint (which included the privacy claim) for failure to follow procedural rules,\n97\nand then rejected plaintiffs' second attempt to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs never objected to or sought review\nof these rulings. On appeal, plaintiffs still do not contest the magistrate judge's decision to reject their amended\ncomplaints, and instead argue that the Fourth Amendment claim pleaded in the original complaint includes the\nclaim against invasion of privacy.\nTo the extent that plaintiffs' claim of invasion of privacy rests on the Fourth Amendment, it fails because it is\nredundant to their illegal strip search claim. Even assuming that the plaintiffs could establish that strip searches\nwere not conducted in the privacy normally required (now a contested issue of fact), this transgression is\ninseparable from the illegal strip search violation itself. By finding the strip searches themselves unlawful, there is\n[58]\nno need to address a particular aspect of searches that is potentially unlawful as well.  If, perhaps, defendants\nwere within their constitutional authority to strip search plaintiffs to begin with, but impermissibly conducted the\nstrip search in a public area, then plaintiffs may have had a privacy-oriented Fourth Amendment claim. But those\nare not the facts before us today. To the extent plaintiffs purport to make a separate invasion of privacy claim, it\nwas not included in their original complaint, and they do not appeal the rejection of their attempts to amend that\ncomplaint. Thus, it is unnecessary for us to address such a claim.\nG. Use of Racial Epithets\nThe district court held that plaintiffs' oral harassment claim was insufficient because plaintiffs failed to make an\nequal protection claim or even refer to the Fourteenth Amendment in their pleadings. The court also concluded\nthat even if plaintiffs had adequately pleaded an equal protection claim, the law was not clearly established that,\n708 in the instant context, racial *708 slurs alone are actionable under the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal,\nplaintiffs argue that the racial slurs allegedly used by the police violate the Fourth Amendment, because the\n\nFourth Amendment embraces all elements of a search and seizure. To support their assertion that oral racial\nharassment violates the Fourth Amendment, however, plaintiffs rely on precedent prohibiting racial insults and\n[59]\ndiscrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Plaintiffs attempt to explain, with little justification, that\nalthough the prohibition against oral harassment based on race occurred in the context of the Equal Protection\nclause, the same prohibition is part of the Fourth Amendment and thus applies to police conduct.\nWe agree with the district court that use of racial epithets deserves our strongest condemnation. None would\ndispute that this form of harassment is highly reprehensible, even more so if it occurred in conjunction with the\nalready invasive and humiliating strip searches.\nNevertheless, as appalling as such behavior would be, here it would only aggravate a seizure that we have\nalready concluded was unlawful. Thus, whether the use of racial epithets alone amounts to a separate and\nindependent constitutional violation under the Fourth Amendment is a question we need not reach because it is\nnot before us today. We have impliedly held that racial epithets that accompany harassment or a violation of\n[60]\nestablished rights may amount to a separate equal protection violation.  In this case, however, for whatever\nreason, plaintiffs chose not to make an equal protection claim.\nH. Municipal Liability\nAt the summary judgment stage, the district court concluded that Harris's strip search and detention of plaintiffs\nwas the official policy, practice and custom of the County because Harris was the final policymaker in law\nenforcement. After trial, the court also concluded that (1) plaintiffs suffered an injury as a result of this policy, and\n(2) the policy was adopted with \"callous and deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of those affected.\"\nOn appeal, plaintiffs maintain that, as Harris was the official policymaker for the County, his role makes the\nCounty liable for the strip search and detention that Harris initiated and pursued with respect to plaintiffs.\nThe law is well-established that a municipality such as the County can be held liable for its policies and customs\nthat engender constitutional deprivation, but that it cannot be held liable for the actions of its non-policy-making\n[61]\nemployees under a theory of respondeat superior.  In Webster v. City of Houston, we concluded that an official\npolicy consists of, among other things, \"[a] policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision that is officially\nadopted and promulgated by the municipality's lawmaking officers or by an official to whom the lawmakers have\n709 delegated policy-making authority.\"[62] We *709 have also held that sheriffs in Texas are final policymakers in the\n[63]\narea of law enforcement.  Therefore, it is clear that the County can be held liable for Harris's intentional\n[64]\nconduct, to the extent it constitutes the \"moving force\" behind the alleged injury.\nHarris testified that he is the final policymaker for law enforcement matters in the County. Harris and others have\ntestified as well that both the strip search and lengthy detention of the plaintiffs were conducted according to the\nSheriff Department's unwritten policy for executing \"hazardous\" warrants. As a result, Harris's actions as\npolicymaker were undeniably the moving force behind, and the direct cause of, the violation of plaintiffs'\n[65]\nconstitutional rights, thereby establishing the County's municipal liability.  Finally, we note that the County has\nnot expressly contested its municipal liability, but rather argued only that it is not liable for actions that do not\namount to constitutional violations, a truism that none contests.\nI. Damages\nThe district court rejected plaintiffs' request for compensatory damages because it found that plaintiffs had failed\nto prove a specific and discernable injury to their respective emotional states. Nevertheless, the court awarded\nplaintiffs nominal damages of $100 per plaintiff, and punitive damages of $15,000 per plaintiff against Harris in his\nindividual capacity. Finding that Harris's conduct \"simply cannot be tolerated in a civilized society,\" the court\nconcluded that punitive damages were an appropriate punishment.\nOn appeal, Harris argues that: (1) nominal damages should have been one dollar; (2) punitive damages were\ninappropriate because Harris lacked evil intent or reckless and callous indifference when carrying out the strip\n\nsearch and detention; and (3) even if punitive damages were permissible, the district court's award was\nexcessive. Plaintiffs do not contest the rejection of their compensatory damages claim.\n1. Nominal Damages\nThe law is well-established in this Circuit that plaintiffs may recover nominal damages when their constitutional\n[66]\nrights have been violated but they are unable to prove actual injury.  The district court relied on the definition\n[67]\nof nominal damages from Black's Law Dictionary which equates such damages with a \"trifling sum.\"  The court\n710 stated that it considered *710 $100 to be nominal \"[g]iven the value of today's dollar.\"\nIn Carey v. Piphus, the Supreme Court recognized the ability of courts to award \"a nominal sum of money\" when\n[68]\na violation of one's rights does not result in actual injury, and awarded nominal damages of one dollar.  The\nCourt did not indicate, however, that in 1978 one dollar was the outer limit of such damages. Although $100 is\nobviously greater than one dollar, this amount is certainly not out of line with nominal damages that we have\n[69]\nawarded in the commercial state law context.  We agree with the district court (and regret), moreover, that\ntoday $100 is an insignificant sum, and thus see no need to disturb that court's conclusion. Further, the court's\nassessment of the situation is not clearly erroneous, much less an abuse of discretion.\n2. Punitive Damages\nJust as nominal damages are allowed without proof of injury, \"a punitive award may stand in the absence of\n[70]\nactual damages where there has been a constitutional violation.\"  But punitive damages may be awarded only\nwhen the defendant's conduct \"is `motivated by evil intent' or demonstrates `reckless or callous indifference' to a\n[71]\nperson's constitutional rights.\"  The latter standard requires \"recklessness in its subjective form,\" i.e. \"a\n[72]\n`subjective consciousness' of a risk of injury or illegality and a `criminal indifference to civil obligations.'\"  The\ndistrict court held that Harris demonstrated a reckless indifference; Harris insists that he acted in good faith.\nThe record provides more than enough evidence from which to conclude that Harris acted with reckless\nindifference toward the constitutional rights of plaintiffs. Although Harris told the court that he believed that he had\nprobable cause to suspect that everyone in the Club had some connection to drugs, it was well-established at the\ntime of this search that Harris needed individualized probable cause to search each of the plaintiffs and the\nninety-plus other individuals at the Club who were not named in the warrant. Not only did Harris lack\nparticularized probable cause when entering the Club, none materialized vis-à-vis the plaintiffs after a patdown.\nWithout any probable cause or articulable reasonable suspicion after a patdown, Harris simply had no legal\nauthority to conduct a strip search. Moreover, the magistrate who issued the search warrant gave Harris only\nenough authority to search the premises and the five individuals named in the warrant, not all others in the Club\nas requested in Harris's affidavit. We conclude that ignoring the limited scope of search authorized by the\nwarrant, and disregarding the Fourth Amendment rights of plaintiffs as long-established by the Supreme Court\n711 and recognized by this Court,[73] constitutes *711 reckless indifference to such rights. In addition, in light of the\ntestimony detailing the atmosphere of questionable privacy during the strip searches and the use of racial slurs,\nwe cannot fault the district court's ruling that Harris was not acting in legal good faith. Even though Harris is no\nlonger Sheriff, punitive damages not only punish him for his conduct; they serve as instructive warnings to his\nsuccessors.\nHarris nevertheless contends that, even if punitive damages are appropriate, the damages awarded by the\ndistrict court were excessive. To determine whether punitive damages are excessive, the Supreme Court requires\nconsideration of three factors (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, which receives the\nheaviest weight; (2) the disparity between the harm suffered (compensatory damages) and the punitive damages\n[74]\naward; and (3) the possible criminal and civil sanctions for comparable misconduct.\nAs outlined above, the degree of reprehensibility of Harris's conduct is high because he perpetrated extremely\ninvasive searches on innocent individuals without specific probable cause or reasonable suspicion, in\n\ncontravention of the warrant itself and clear precedent. Second, we agree with the district court that although the\ndisparity between compensatory damages and punitive damages here is great, such disparity deserves less\nweight in § 1983 suits like this one. The Supreme Court has counseled that this factor does not impose a\nmathematical formula for constitutional proportionality, but instead only embodies \"a general concern of\n[75]\nreasonableness.\"  Because actions seeking vindication of constitutional rights are more likely to result only in\n[76]\nnominal damages, strict proportionality would defeat the ability to award punitive damages at all.  Based on\nour review of the case law and our deference to the district court's discretion on this matter, we conclude that\n[77]\n$15,000 per plaintiff is not unreasonable in light of the violations that took place.\n712  J. Declaratory Relief\n*712\nFinally, Harris and the County contend that they did not violate Article I, section 9 of the Texas Constitution, which\nmirrors the language of the Fourth Amendment. Both parties acknowledge that this constitutional provision is\ninterpreted as congruent with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Indeed, the Texas Court of Appeals has held that\n\"our article I, section 9 provides at least as much protection as the Fourth Amendment of the United States\n[78]\nConstitution.\"  Thus, based on our earlier conclusions that Harris and the County violated the Fourth\nAmendment, we also conclude that the declaratory relief granted to plaintiffs is appropriate.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the district court are, in all respects,\nAFFIRMED.\n[*] District Judge of the Western District of Texas, sitting by designation.\n[1] According to the district court, the Kaufman County Sheriff's department considers the execution of a narcotics\nwarrant a \"hazardous entry,\" where weapons are likely to be present. Additionally, in a March 1994 search of the\nClub, police found drugs, drug paraphernalia, and a concealed .25 caliber pistol. After this search, Harris\napparently received an anonymous telephone call threatening to kill him if he returned to the Club. Harris also\ntestified that an officer had been shot at previously while attempting to execute a warrant at the Club.\n[2] Plaintiff brought a variety of other claims, such as excessive force, civil conspiracy, assault and battery, and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, but all were rejected on summary judgment and have not been\nappealed to us.\n[3] The district court dismissed the unlawful detention claims of all of the Group 1 plaintiffs, who consisted of\nthose inside the Club when the premises were secured by police, but allowed to go to trial the detention claims of\nthe Group 2 plaintiffs, who consisted of those outside of the Club when the premises were secured. Plaintiff\nThomas Gene Brown was outside the Club when the premises were secured, and therefore should have been\nnamed in Group 2. When the court described the different groups of plaintiffs, however, it placed Brown in Group\n1. As the court subsequently addressed Brown's unlawful detention claim at trial, the implied inclusion of his\nname in Group 1 at the summary judgment stage appears to have been an inadvertent and harmless mistake.\n[4] The court also directed the parties to attempt to resolve the attorneys' fees issues themselves.\n[5]Harper v.

The district court, however, unnecessarily decoupled the clearly established/objective unreasonableness\ntest of the Supreme Court. That is, if a right is clearly established enough to impart fair warning to officers, then\ntheir conduct in violating that right cannot be objectively reasonable.\n[12]Hope, 536 U.S. at 736, 122 S.Ct. 2508 (citing Saucier v.

Id. at\n741-46, 122 S.Ct. 2508. In particular, the precedent it relied on already prohibited (1) handcuffing inmates to\nfences for long periods of time, and (2) physical punishment that occurred after a prisoner had terminated his\nresistance to authority.

Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) justifies\nstrip searches on the reasonable suspicion that an individual is concealing weapons or contraband. Bell,\nhowever, dealt with pre-trial detainees who were awaiting trial on serious federal charges. Stewart v. Lubbock\nCounty, 767 F.2d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1985) (explaining Bell's holding). Thus, the intrusiveness/law enforcement\ninterests balance was more heavily in favor of law enforcement than the one conducted here, in which the police\nlacked both articulable reasonable suspicion and probable cause of wrong-doing to conduct any type of search.\n[26]Watt v.

Here,\nhowever, plaintiffs alleged that they were not afforded the requisite privacy, and the district court found that the\nsearches were conducted \"in an atmosphere of questionable privacy.\"\n[35] Plaintiffs also assert that they were detained for three hours after completion of the strip search. This\nassertion is contradicted by the district court's factual finding and record testimony that they entire search of the\nClub lasted only about three hours.\n[36] 452 U.S. 692, 699-701, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981).\n[37]Id. at 700, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[38]Id. at 699-700, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[39]Id. at 699, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[40]Id. at 700, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[41]Id. at 700-01, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[42]Id. at 701-02, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[43]Id. at 702, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[44]Id. at 702-03, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[45]Id. at 703-04, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[46]Id. at 704-05, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[47] 161 F.3d 834, 838 (5th Cir.1998).\n[48]Id. at 838. Heitschmidt was living with Anne Fucaluro, who operated a prostitution ring. Fucaluro was\narrested and police obtained a warrant to search the house, but Heitschmidt was not a target of the investigation,\nnor did police have suspicion before the search that he was involved in any wrong-doing. Id. at 835.\n[49]Id. at 838.\n[50]Id. In particular, we noted that there was no evidence that Heitschmidt was involved in the prostitution ring\nthey were investigating, or that he would use a weapon. Id.\n[51]Id. at 838-39.\n[52]Id. The Summers Court had specifically stated that it did \"not decide whether the same result [i.e. permissible\ndetention] would be justified if the search warrant merely authorized a search for evidence.\" 452 U.S. at 705, n.\n20, 101 S.Ct. 2587.\n[53]Heitschmidt, 161 F.3d at 839.\n\n[54]Summers ultimately held that the authority to detain occupants of premises was only permissible \"while a \nproper search is conducted.\" 452 U.S. at 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587 (emphasis added). Although Harris had a valid\nwarrant to search the premises, we have already concluded that the strip search of plaintiffs was both improper\nand illegal, and exceeded the scope of that warrant.\n[55] Because Brown's nephew owned the Club, he apparently had an interest in finding out what was happening\nat the Club. But this interest did not necessarily include remaining at the Club while the search was conducted.\nHe had not been at the Club that evening, and was brought inside after the police had begun the raid. Thus, his\npossible reasons for being there are not the same as the house owner in Summers or Heitschmidt.\n[56] The ultimate standard of reasonableness in the Fourth Amendment and the fact-specific character of these\ncases dissuade us from attempting to decide exactly what would have been a permissible period of detention had\nthe police conducted a lawful search. In other contexts, we have held that when an officer pats down a person\nwhom he reasonably suspects is carrying a weapon, and finds nothing, the officer may not further detain the\nindividual, because his suspicion \"has evaporated and no longer justifies further detention.\" United States v.\nShabazz, 993 F.2d 431, 436 (5th Cir.1993). Similarly, it is well-established in this Circuit that a detention should\nend as soon as the underlying justification for the stop is served, for instance by running a computer check that\ncomes back negative; any further detention becomes an unreasonable seizure because it is unsupported by\nprobable cause.

The district court did not need to determine\nwhether Harris's conduct also amounted to deliberate indifference, because that element must be shown only\nwhen there is a claim that the municipality's facially lawful action caused an employee to inflict the injury, not\nwhen the municipality (through its policymaker) has directly caused the injury, as has occurred here.

The Supreme Court's recent\nrevisit of the Gore factors in State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Campbell does not alter our\nconclusion here. ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003). Campbell reviewed jury-awarded\ncompensatory damages of $1 million and punitive damages of $145 million; and although the Court stated that\nextreme ratios should be presumptively invalid, it focused primarily on the constitutionality of punitive damages\nvis-a-vis compensatory damages awarded by juries. See id. at 1521, 1524. As the instant case concerns (1) the\nratio between punitive and nominal damages, (2) awarded by a judge rather than a jury, (3) in much smaller\ndollar amounts of punitive damage awards 00 $100 nominal damages and $15,000 punitive damages per plaintiff\n97\n00Campbell's discussion of the proper ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is inapposite to our\n97\nconsideration today.\n[76] The third factor, what comparable criminal and civil sanctions would have been for Harris, is not easily\napplicable to this type of constitutional violation, because there is no readily identifiable law imposing civil or\ncriminal penalties on law enforcement officers for such violations.\n[77] Our research has revealed relatively few other cases addressing the amount of punitive damages awarded in\nthe context of civil rights actions. The Second Circuit concluded that $10,000 in punitive damages when only\nnominal damages were awarded \"approaches the limits of what we would deem consistent with constitutional\nconstraints.\" Provost v. City of Newburgh, 262 F.3d 146, 164 (2nd Cir.2001). In a case concerning the illegal strip\nsearch of a prisoner, the Seventh Circuit reduced a jury-decided punitive damages award of $15,000 to $6,000. \nMcKinley v. Trattles, 732 F.2d 1320, 1327-28 (7th Cir.1984). For the illegal strip search of high school students,\nthe New Mexico Supreme Court approved punitive damages awards of $62,500 to one plaintiff and $37,500 to\nthe other plaintiff, but also awarded compensatory damages of $50,000 to each.

RULES \n58  AfW  79a. \nORDER \nThe findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the magistrate judge are before the court. \nAfter making an independent review of the pleadings, files and records in this case, the findings, \nconclusions and recommendation of the magistrate judge, the parties' objections to the magistrate's \nfindings  and  recommendation,  the court concludes that the  findings  and conclusions  of the \nmagistrate judge are correct.  The court therefore orders as follows: \nThe findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the magistrate judge are adopted by the \ncourt, and that the objections filed by the parties are OVERRULED. \nPlaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, to the extent that it seeks a \ndeclaration that the Eleventh Amendment and sovereign immunity do not bar suit against Defendants \nunder 42 U.S.c. § 1983. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED in all other respects. \nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED as to the following claims: \nPlaintiffs' excessive force claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiffs' claim for damages resulting \nfrom an alleged violation of the Texas Constitution, and Plaintiffs' state law claims for assault, \nbattery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy.  Defendants' Motion for \n\nSummary Judgment is also DENIED with respect to Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief regarding \nDefendants' alleged violations of Article I, Section 9 of the Texas constitution. \nAs the United States Magistrate Judge correctly noted, Defendants did not raise the following \nissues in their motion for summary judgment: Plaintiffs' section 1983 claims based upon an alleged \nillegal strip search, unlawful detention, invasion of privacy, and verbal harassment based on race. \nDefendants did not properly address these issues by raising them for the first time in their reply. \nBased upon the applicable law and the Magistrate Judge's analysis, the court has determined that \nsummary judgment may be proper with regard to some of these claims.  Therefore, Defendants are \nhereby directed to file a second motion for summary judgment which addresses these claims by \nNovember 30, 1998.  Plaintiffs shall file their response to Defendants' summary judgment motion \nby December 21, 1998.  Defendants' reply, if any, shall be filed by January 4, 1999.  The court will \naccept no other pleadings regarding Defendants' Second Motion for Summary Judgment. \nThe court further directs the parties to specifically address the following issue in their \nbriefing on Defendants' Second Motion for Summary Judgment: whether verbal harassment based \non race constitutes a valid cause of action that can be brought under 42 U.S.c. § 1983. \nThe court also notes that both Plaintiffs and Defendants were not totally forthcoming in ~he \npresentation of some of the summary judgment issues  and evidence.  When this  occurs,  it \nunnecessarily delays the proper administration of justice.  The court therefore expects the parties to \naddress the remaining summary judgment issues with complete candor. \n2 \n\nSO ORDERED this / 2 ~y of November, 1998. \nSam A.

After consideration of the revised supplemental fee \nrequest, responses, record, appendices, and applicable law, the court grants as herein modified \nPlaintiffs' Revised Supplemental Application for Attorney's Fees Md Related Expenses. \nI.  Background \nIn its order of July 30, 2003, the court directed Plaintiffs to submit a revised supplemental \napplication for attorney's fees and related expenses. The court so ordered because it determined that \n$184,022.48 for fees  and related expenses was excessive.  In Plaintiffs' revised supplemental \napplication, they seek a total of$119,508.60 for attorney's fees and related expenses ($105,818.75 \nfor attorney's fees Md $13,689.85 in related expenses).  Plaintiffs contend that these fees Md related \n1 \nexpenses were reasonable Md necessary to prosecute their fee application. \nSpecifically, in the revised supplemental request Plaintiffs seek $48,357.50 for Gerald Birnberg and \n1 \n$57,461.25 for William Charles Bundren and his legal assistant in attorney's fees; and they seek $3,721.26 \nin related expenses for Mr. Birnberg and $9,968.59 in such expenses for Mr. Bundren. \nOrder -Page 1 \n\nDefendants Kaufman County and Sheriff Robert Harris (collectively \"Defendants\") contend \nthat the fees requested in the revised supplemental application are excessive.2  Defendants contend \nthat the revised supplemental application should be denied in its entirety, since the fees sought \ntherein were incurred solely because of the \"exorbitant\" initial fee request. \nII.  Discussion \nThe court recognizes from the outset that the issue here is the number of hours requested. \nThe hourly rates and competence of Gerald M. Bimberg and William Charles Bundren are not a \nsource of dispute.  The court has known Messrs. Bimberg and Bundren for over fifteen years, and \nrecognizes both as highly competent attorneys in the area of civil rights litigation. Their competence \nis  not in  question.  The  court  simply determines  that this  case  has  been  overlitigated,  and \nsubstantially more time than necessary has been expended litigating the fee issue. \nAs with most cases, and this one is no different, the ultimate resolution of the issue in dispute \nlies somewhere between the two extremes. In any event, the court is convinced that neither side has \ntaken a reasonable approach to the revised supplemental application. Although Plaintiffs' reduction \nof its fees in its revised supplemental application is a step in the right direction, it does not go nearly \nfar enough, and the amount requested is still excessive or exorbitant.3  Likewise, Defendants' \ncontention that Plaintiffs should recover nothing as supplemental fees and related expenses is \nunrealistic.  As the parties have provided only a modicum of assistance to the court in resolving the \n2SheriffHarris did not file a response to Plaintiffs' Revised Supplemental Application for Attorney's \nFees and Related Expenses.  Harris did file a response to Plaintiffs initial fee supplement, and the court \nassumes that he adopts the same position regarding Plaintiffs' revised supplement. \n3In its order of July 30, 2003, the court diplomatically referred to the supplemental request as \n\"excessive,\" but in reality it was mind-boggling. \nOrder -Page 2 \n\nissue  of attorney's fees,  the court faces  the unenviable task of wading  into the morass  and \ndetermining what constitutes reasonable attorney's fees and related expenses with respect to the \nrevised supplemental application. \nA prevailing party is entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for the time \nexpended establishing and litigating a fee request.4  Cruz v.  Hauck, 762 F.2d 1230, 1233 (5th Cir. \n1985) (citing Johnson v. State ofM  ississippi, 606 F.2d 635,637-38 (5th Cir. 1979)).  A prevailing \nplaintiff \"should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such \nan award unjust.\" Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc., 390 U.S. 400,402 (1968). \"Ift he Plaintiffs' \n'natural zeal' resulted in their expending more effort than reasonably necessary to establish and \ndefend their fee claim, the district court may reduce the compensable number of hours accordingly.\" \nCruz, 762 F.2d at 1234.  Finally, \"[I]fthe attorney's initial claims are exorbitant [or the time spent \nadvancing them unreasonable], the district court should refuse the further compensation.\" Alberti \nv. Klevenhagen, 896 F.2d 927, 937 (5th Cir.), vacated in part on other grounds, 903 F.2d 352 (1990) \n(quoting Lund v. Affleck, 587 F.2d 75, 77 (pt Cir. 1978)). As the court has determined that both the \ninitial fee request and the initial supplemental fee request were excessive, it could deny any further \ncompensation regarding the revised supplemental fee request.  Id.  The court believes that the \nlanguage ofA  lberti must be tempered with reason, depending on the circumstances oft he case before \nit.  To do otherwise would be fundamentally unfair to Plaintiffs because they did expend some \nreasonable hours in prosecuting the fee application.  The court believes that the better approach \n4The court sets forth only the law as applicable for time expended for prosecuting and defending a \nfee claim.  As the court has already set forth the law governing the initial fee request in a prior opinion, \nrestating the law here would be cumulative and unnecessary. \nOrder -Page 3 \n\nunder  these  circumstances  is  to  adjust  the  amount  requested  rather  than  deny  the  revised \nsupplemental request outright. \nMr. Birnberg states the 220 hours he actually expended on the prosecution of the fee request \nis \"an unusually high number of hours to be expended by a special fees counsel in connection with \na fee application.\" Plaintiffs' Supplemental Appendix (\"Supp. App.\"), filed August 13, 2003, ~ 12 \nat 5. The court agrees.5 He contends, however, that such time was reasonable and necessary because \n\"defendants resisted every aspect of plaintiffs' fees claim (other than hourly rates) tenaciously, and \nasserted a myriad of factual and legal defenses.\"  Id.  This argument, of course, begs the question \nregarding the invalidity of Defendants' objections.  The court previously addressed this argument \nin its Order of July 30, 2003, at 3, and stated: \nPlaintiffs'  Supplemental  Application  seeks  a  total  of \n$184,022.48 as fees and expenses in litigating the fee award. As with \nPlaintiffs' original fee request, the amount sought is excessive and \nneeds  to  be  adjusted.  Almost  $170,000  of this  amount  is  for \nattorney's fees. In an effort to justify their request, Plaintiffs note that \nDefendants vigorously contested the fee application and made over \n635 objections in the initial request, which was for almost one million \ndollars.  Defendants made numerous objections, but many of those \nobjections were well-founded as reflected by the court's ruling, and, \nfrankly, a number of entries on the original fee application should \nhave never been included in the initial fee request. Had they not been \nincluded, no objections would have been necessary.  Accordingly, \nunnecessary time was expended by Plaintiffs in including such entries \nand thereby responding to Defendants' objections. \nSIn  addition to the 220 hours initially sought by Mr.  Bimberg, Mr.  Bundren initially sought \ncompensation for 303.5 hours he expended and 123.5 hours for time expended by his paralegal.  In the \nrevised supplemental application, Mr. Bimberg reduced his fee request to 80% of the hours actually \nexpended by him; and Mr. Bundren reduced his request by 50%. \nOrder -Page 4 \n\nThe court's conclusion expressed in its earlier order has not changed: Plaintiffs' over-inclusion of \nunwarranted entries substantially and unnecessarily increased the time spent by their attorneys on \nthe fee request. \nAs the court has already concluded, Plaintiffs included many entries in their initial fee request \nthat should not have been included.  Plaintiffs thus expended unnecessary time in including these \nentries and defending their fee claim by responding to Defendants' objections to the inclusion of \nsuch entries.  The court determines that it should apply the limited success rule to determine the \nappropriate amount of attorney's fees to be awarded for Plaintiffs establishing and defending their \nfee claim.  When a party has achieved only limited or marginal success on claim(s) asserted, the \nSupreme Court has observed: \nIf . . . a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the \nproduct of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole \ntimes a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount. This will \nbe  true  even  where  the  plaintiff s  claims  were  interrelated, \nnonfrivolous, and raised in good faith.  Congress has not authorized \nan award of fees whenever it was reasonable for the plaintiff to bring \na lawsuit or whenever conscientious counsel tried the case with \ndevotion and skill.  Again, the most critical factor is the degree of \nsuccess obtained. \nHensley v.  Eckerhart, 461  U.S. 424, 436 (1983).  In a case where a plaintiff has achieved only \nlimited or partial success, once a court considers the \"amount and nature of damages awarded, [it] \nmay lawfully award low fees  or no fees without reciting the  12  [Johnson]  factors bearing on \nreasonableness,\" or without computing the lodestar.  Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 115 (1992). \nThe fee award must be the result of a \"measured exercise of discretion\" on the court's part.  Id. at \n114.  The court believes that this same principle should be applied to the revised supplemental fee \nOrder -Page 5 \n\nrequest, as Plaintiffs received only limited success with respect to their initial fee request.  Plaintiffs \nsought $979,746.50 in attorney's fees and were awarded $373,555.45 as reasonable attorney's fees. \nThe question thus becomes by what amount should the revised fee request be reduced.  As \nthe Supreme Court has stated: \nThere is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations. \nThe district court may attempt to identify specific hours that should \nbe eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the \nlimited success.  The court necessarily has discretion in making this \nequitable judgment.  This discretion, however, must be exercised in \nlight of the considerations we have identified. \nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37.  Since the court has the option of either identifying specific hours that \ncould be eliminated or reducing the award, the court elects to reduce the amount requested with \nrespect to the amount of fees requested for litigating the fee request.  As the issue of attorney's fees \n\"should not result in a second major litigation,\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, this court will not spend \nnumerous additional hours painstakingly reviewing each entry with respect to litigation of the fee \nclaim.6  The court has undertook such a review with respect to Plaintiffs' initial fee request when it \ntediously reviewed the initial fee request and subsequently issued its order regarding such fee \nrequest. \nThe court has awarded attorney's fees in civil rights and employment cases, and has dealt \nwith supplemental requests that sought fees for establishing and defending the fee claim.  The time \nrequested in the previous  supplemental requests have ranged from  slightly over  12  hours to \napproximately 30 hours.  This court is well acquainted with the time it takes for an attorney to \n6Given the tremendous overkill regarding the fee claim, such a review would be of no assistance, as \nit is impossible to segregate and eliminate the specific hours that should be eliminated. Doing so would be, \nat best, an exercise in futility or, at worst, a charade. \nOrder -Page 6 \n------ ---------------\n\nestablish and defend an attorney's fee claim in a typical civil rights case. The court realizes that this \nis not the typical civil rights case - there were numerous parties and issues - and it  should not be \nplaced in such a category because of the inherent intricacies and complexities that must be factored \ninto such a case when deciding a supplemental fee award.  At the same time, the court determines \nthat counsel's zeal  has  resulted  in their expending substantially more hours than reasonably \nnecessary to establish and defend their fee claim. \nBased on its experience on civil rights litigation, its knowledge of what has transpired in this \ncase, its earlier rulings, and its experience in setting fees in other civil rights cases, the court \nexercises its discretion and determines that 64 attorney hours is reasonable and appropriate for \nPlaintiffs to compile readily available billable information and otherwise defend their attorney's fees \nclaim.7 This amount reflects just over one and one-half weeks of work (based on an eight-hour day), \nwhich is much more in line with what is reasonable, as opposed to the 523.5 hours (over 13 weeks) \noriginally requested by Plaintiffs' counsel, or the revised request for 318.5 hours (166.75 for Mr. \nBirnberg and 151.75 for Mr. Bundren),8 which comes to almost eight weeks of work. \nBased on the court's determination of 64 hours, the reasonable fee for Plaintiffs' establishing \nand defending their fee claim is $21,760.  This figure is based on an hourly rate of $340 per hour, \n7In determining that the hours are reasonable and that they adequately compensate Plaintiffs' counsel \nfor the time expended in establishing and defending their fee claim, the court declines to award any fees for \nservices performed by Mr. Bundren's legal assistant.  Awarding additional fees beyond this amount would \nonly result in a \"windfall,\" and an award of attorney's fees should not result in a \"windfall\" to Plaintiffs. \nMoreover, given the excessive nature of the original and supplemental fee requests, the court is permitted \nin its discretion to deny such further compensation. Alberti, 896 F.2d at 937. \n8This number does not include the 61.5 hours requested on behalf of Mr. Bundren's legal assistant. \nOrder -Page 7 \n\nwhich was used by the court with respect to the initial fee claim.9  The court finds it unnecessary to \napportion the fees between Plaintiffs' counsel, as it is confident that this determination can be made \nby Plaintiffs and their attorneys. \nFinally, withrespectto related costs, Plaintiffs seek $13,689.85 ($3,721.26 for Mr. Birnberg, \nand $9,968.59 for Mr. Bundren). The amount requested for Mr. Bundren represents a 10% reduction \nof the original supplemental fee request. The amount requested for Mr. Birnberg remains the same. \nDefendant Harris objects to $3,667 in costs because \"these have already been addressed by the \ncourt.\" Defendant Robert Harris's Brief in Response to Plaintiffs' Rule 59 Motion at 4.  The court \ncannot ascertain the specific costs entries to which Harris refers. Moreover, Plaintiffs reply that they \ndo not request costs for the same items twice.  Although neither side really fleshes out this matter, \nDefendants fail to show that Plaintiffs are not entitled to the $3,667 in costs as requested. Other than \nthis reference, Defendants make no specific objections to the amount of related expenses requested, \nalthough they do state that the revised supplemental fees and related expenses are exorbitant. In light \nof the evidence presented by Plaintiffs and the lack of specific objections by Defendants, the court \ndetermines that the amount requested in the revised supplemental fee request for related expenses \nis reasonable, and was necessarily incurred as a result of establishing and defending the fee claim. \nPlaintiffs are thus entitled to $13,689.85 for related expenses incurred with respect to their fee claim. \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons previously stated, the court grants as modified herein Plaintiffs' Revised \nSupplemental Application for Attorney's Fees and Related Expenses.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are \n9Plaintiffs state that Mr. Bimberg is willing to reduce his current rate of $375 per hour to $290 per \nhour for purposes of the revised supplemental fee request.  The court finds this unnecessary because the \nhourly rate used by the court is $35 per hour less than Mr. Bimberg's customary hourly rate. \nOrder -Page 8 \n\nentitled to recover from Defendants Kaufman County and Kaufman County Sheriff Robert Harris, \njointly and severally, the amount of$21,760 as attorney's fees for establishing and defending their \nfee claim, and shall recover the sum of$13,689.85 as related expenses with respect to the revised \nsupplemental request.  Judgment will issue by separate document as required by Fed. R Civ. P. 58. \nAs the court has spent extensive time on the issue of attorney's fees and it is convinced that \nthe overall fee award is fair and reasonable, it is not inclined to reconsider or alter this order; its \nAmended Memorandum Opinion and Order of July 30, 2003; or the subsequent judgment, unless \n(l) a typographical or clerical error is revealed, and correction of the error is necessary to preserve \nthe rights ofa party; or (2) the parties agree to the relief requested. For all other matters, the parties \nmay seek relief at the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, New Orleans, Louisiana. \n~fNovember, \nIt is so ordered this  2003. \nSam A.
