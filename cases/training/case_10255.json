    "summary": "<p>On May 16, 2006 a juvenile detainee filed a class action civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, challenging the strip search policy of the Dona Ana County Juvenile Detention Center. Plaintiff alleged that the County and officials in charge of Juvenile Detention Center had a blanket policy of strip searching all pre-arraignment detainees upon their arrival at the Juvenile Detention Center, regardless of the offense charged, or whether there was any suspicion that the detainee possessed weapons or contraband. The plaintiff, who was strip searched pursuant to this policy, alleged that that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. The County and Detention Center officials generally denied the allegations.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after the suit was filed, the District Court (Judge Judith C. Herrera) stayed the proceedings at the request of the parties so that they could pursue settlement negotiations. Plaintiff's attorney had filed a similar class action on behalf of adult detainees that were strip searched at the Dona Ana County. See <a href=\"../../../../case/9613/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lira v. Dona Ana County</a>. Negotiations were conducted on both the adult and juvenile cases. On November 21, 2007, Judge William Johnson consolidated both cases, designating Lira as the lead case.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after the consolidation, the parties filed an Amended Stipulation of Settlement, under which the Defendants agreed to pay $5.3 million to resolve all class claims. The stipulated Adult Settlement Class included all detainees who were strip searched between March 7, 2003 and March 7, 2006 at the Dona Ana County Jail prior to arraignment. The stipulated Juvenile Settlement class included all detainees who were strip searched between May 16, 2003 and May 16, 2006 at the Dona Ana Juvenile Detention Center. It was estimated that there were approximately 11,000 class members. Individual claims were to be paid per an agreed upon distribution formula, with the range of expected pay-outs per individual claimant was estimated at $1,200 to $2,400. Representative plaintiffs would receive a total $200,000 or $25,000 per class representative. $1,666,667 of the settlement fund was allocated for attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Johnson preliminarily approved the settlement on December 20, 2007.</p>\r\n<p>On May 20, 2008, the district court (Judge Johnson) issued a final approval of the settlement and a final judgment of dismissal in the case. In 2011, the parties filed a Joint Motion to allow disbursement of remaining funds to two non-profit entities. Although most of the funds had been successfully distributed, about $22,000 remained for claimants the administrator could not reach. The court granted the motion.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "text": "Case 1:06-cv-00179-WJ-WPL   Document 66    Filed 04/08/11   Page 1 of 5\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nJESUS LIRA, BEN GARCIA, GRACIELA\nMARTINEZ, STEPHEN CULLER, CYNTHIA\nARCHER, FREDERICK GARCIA and DOUGLAS\nBEIDLER, on their own behalf and on behalf of a \nclass of similarly situated persons,\nPlaintiffs,\nvs. Case No. CIV-06-0179 WPJ/WPL\nDONA ANA COUNTY BOARD OF\nCOMMISSIONERS; Dona Ana County\nDetention Center administrator CHRISTOPHER\nBARELA, in his individual and official capacities;\nformer Dona Ana County Detention Center \nadministrator DAVID WOOLEY, in his\nindividual and official capacities; former\nDona Ana County Detention Center\nadministrator ALFONSO SOLIZ, in his\nindividual and official capacities, and former\nDona Ana County Detention Center acting\nadministrator CHERYL ROACH, in her\nindividual and official capacities,\nDefendants.\nJOINT MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL\nDISTRIBUTION OF SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS\nCOME NOW the parties hereto, by and through their respective counsel, below-listed,\nand jointly move this Court for the entry of an order approving the final distribution of the\nremaining proceeds resulting from the settlement of the above-referenced cause.  In support\nthereof, the parties jointly state:\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00179-WJ-WPL   Document 66    Filed 04/08/11   Page 2 of 5\n1. On May 20, 2008, this Court entered its Final Judgment of Dismissal and\nOrder Granting Final Approval of Settlement Agreement [Doc. No. 62].  That document gave\nfinal approval to the settlement agreement between the parties and authorized payments to be\nmade to class members pursuant to the formula agreed to between the parties in the\nstipulation of settlement.\n2. The claims administrator has now fully administered the fund and made\ndistributions in accordance with the stipulation of settlement.\n3. After payment of all verified claims, payment of attorney’s fees and costs\nincurred by class counsel, and payment of all costs of claims administration, there remains a\nbalance in the fund of $22,009.99.  This amount is primarily the result of checks to settlement\nclass members which, despite repeated efforts of the claims administrator, were never\nnegotiated and have become void.\n4. The stipulation and other settlement documents do not address how leftover\nfunds are to be disposed of.  The parties are in agreement that, under the doctrine of cy pres,\nand subject to Court approval, it would be appropriate to disburse such amounts to a non-\nprofit entity1.  Such a procedure has been utilized and approved in other class action\n1 The doctrine of cy pres allows the Court to authorize the distribution of unclaimed\ncharitable funds so that they are put to their next best use in keeping with the law and the\nintent of the plaintiffs’ claims in a class action.  Cook v. Rockwell International Corp., 564 F.\nSupp. 2d 1189, 1222 (D. Colo. 2008).  Although the Tenth Circuit has never formally\naddressed the cy pres doctrine, there is precedent for this approach.  Id.; See Brewer v. S.\nUnion Co., No. 83-F-1174 1987 U.S. Dist. Lexus 15940, * 7-18 (D. Colo. Aug. 13, 1987);\nPonca Tribe v. Continental Carbon Co., 2009 WL. 28396508 at 5 (W. D. Okla. 2009).\n-2-\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00179-WJ-WPL   Document 66    Filed 04/08/11   Page 3 of 5\nlitigation, including this Court’s order, the strip search class action in Allison v. Lincoln\nCounty Board of Commissioners, et al., USDC DNM No. CV 05-881 WPJ/WDS [Doc. No.\n68], as well as by other judges of this district, including Torres v. Valencia County Board of\nCommissioners, et al., USDC DNM No. CV 07-0328 MCA/WDS [Doc No. 78] and Shannon\nv. Hidalgo County Board of Commissioners, et al, USDC DNM No. CV 08-0369 JH/LFG\n[Doc. No. 37].\n5. The parties, having investigated appropriate recipients, jointly propose that the\nbalance left in the account be distributed in equal shares of $11,004.99 each to (1) the Mesilla\nValley Community of Hope (“MVCH”) and (2) the Community Foundation of Southern New\nMexico (“CFSNM”).  \n6. MVCH is a 501(C)(3) tax exempt non-profit entity which has as its \nmission to provide a variety of services to the homeless of Dona Ana County, including\nfinding lodging, laundry services, arranging counseling, obtaining identification, providing\nfree legal services and emergency financial support.  Attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a\ndescription of the structure, programs and accomplishments of MVCH, as well as its\nexecutive and administrative staff.\n7. CFSNM is also a 501(C) (3) tax exempt non-profit entity which has its mission \nensuring that the people of Southern New Mexico have access to quality healthcare close to\nhome.  Attached hereto as Exhibit 2 is a description of the structure, programs and\naccomplishments of CFSNM, as well as its executive and administrative staff.\n-3-\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00179-WJ-WPL   Document 66    Filed 04/08/11   Page 4 of 5\n8. The parties jointly seek the Court’s approval of this proposed distribution of\nthe remaining funds in the settlement account.  After such distribution, all funds will be\ncompletely accounted for in connection with this settlement.  \nWHEREFORE, for all of the foregoing reasons, the parties hereto jointly propose that\nthe Court enter its order approving the distribution of the remaining balance in the settlement\naccount as set forth above.\nRespectfully submitted,\nROTHSTEIN, DONATELLI, HUGHES,\nDAHLSTROM, SCHOENBURG & BIENVENU, LLP\nBy:  Electronically Signed 4/8/11                \nRobert R.

Paragraphs I through 10 above are incorporated herein hy reference as if fully sct \nforth in this paragraph. \n12.  Plaintiffis 19 years old.  She lives in Las Cruccs, New Mexico.  At the time of this \nincident, Plaintiff was 17 years old and attended Hatch Valley High School.  Prior to July 28,2004, \nshe had never been arrested in her life. \n13.  On July 28, 2004, Plaintiff was charged with transporting illegal aliens within the \nUnited States.  She was taken to the DACJDC to he booked.  Plaintiff was taken to a room and \nordered to disrobe.  She asked the ot1icer if that meant all her clothes.  The officer replied that she \nhad to take evcrything off.  Plaintiff then removcd all her clothing as instmcted, leaving hcr \ncompletely naked in front of the guard. \n14.  While Plaintiff was naked, the officer visually examined her and ordered her to \nsquat and cough.  She complied.  Nothing was found. \n15.  Defendants and their employees, agents and representatives had no valid reason for \n5 \n\nconducting a strip search of Plaintiff.  Nothing ill Plaintiffs history, nor the circumstances of her \narrest. gave Defendants reasonable suspicion that a strip search of Plaintiff would result in the \ndiscovery of contraband or weapons.  Rather. the strip search of Plainti ff was undertaken pursuant \nto a blanket and indiscriminate policy of strip searching detainees processed at the DACJDC, in \nviolation of well-settled constitutional law and standards of correctional practice. \n16.  Plaintiff was shocked, repulsed. humiliated. ashamed and distraught at hcing \nsubjectcd to this dcgrading and dehumanizing invasion of her privacy. \nIV. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATlO:'llS \n17.  Paragraphs 1 through 16, abovc. are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set \nforth in this paragraph. \n18.  The strip search to which Plaintiff was subjected was perfol1ncd pursuant to the \npolicies. practices and customs of Defendants of conducting strip searches of all incoming \ndetainees.  The searches complained ofhcrein were performed without regard to the nature of the \nalleged offenses for which Plaintiff and memhers of the class had heen detained, and without \nDefendants or their employees. agents and representatives having a reasonahle bcliefthat the \nPlaintiff or members of the class possessed weapons or contrahand. or that there existed facts \nsupporting a reasonable bcliefthat the searches would produce contraband or weapons. \n19.  This civil action is brought by Plaintiff on her own behalf and on hehalf of a class of \nsimilarly situated persons. pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  The class for which Plaintiff seeks \nccrti fication is defined as follows:  all persons who, in thc period from May 1G . 2003. to the \npresent and continuing until this mattcr is adjudicated and the practices complained of herein \ncease, were detained and suhjected to a strip scarch and/or body cavity search at the Dona Ana \n6 \n\nCounty Juvenile Detention Center pursuant to a policy. practice or custom of conducting strip \nsearches on incoming detainees without individualized reasonahle suspicion that the search would \nlead to the discovery of contraband or weapons. \n20.  Plaintiffis a member of the class she seeks to represent. and has standing to hring \nthis action because she was arrested and subjected to a strip search and/or visual body search at the \nDACJDC in the absence of a reasonable suspicion that the search would reveal the presence of \ncontraband or weapons. as set forth in more detail above. \n21.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Plaintiff. individually and on behalfofthe members \nof the class. seeks such relief as is just and equitahle. including hut not limited to: \n(i)  Complete disclosure of all information within the possession. custody or control of \nDefendants concerning. relating to or involving the searches complained of herein; \n(ii)  Judicial declaration that the searches complained of herein arc unlawful; \n(ii i)  Issuance of a pern1anent injunction prohihiting Defendants from engaging in the \nsearches complained of herein; and \n(iv)  Judgment lor compensatory and punitive damages to the fullest extent allowahle by \nlaw from Defendants in favor of Plaintiff and the members of the class for personal and economic \ninjury. and deprivation of statutory and/or common law rights resulting from Defendants' practices. \n22.  Plaintiff is not yet able to state precisely the size of the class.  On information and \nbelief. Plaintiff alleges that there often are more than 25 persons per month who are detained and \nbooked into the DACJDC and subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of \nDelcndants' policies. practices. and customs related to said searches.  Thus. the class is sufficiently \nnumerous that joinder of all members herein is impracticahle.  The exact number of class memhers \n7 \n\nwill bc ascertained tbrough appropriate discovery, from rccords maintained by Defcndants and \ntheir agents. \n13.  Questions oflaw and fact are common to thc claims of Plaintiff and the members of \nthe class, including but not limited to (I) whether DACJDC officers routinely subjcct pcrsons \narrested to strip searches and/or body cavity searches; (2) whcther persons are subjected to strip \nsearchcs and/or body cavity searches in the absence of any reasonable suspicion, based on speci fic \nand articulable facts, to believe any particular detainee has concealed drugs, weapons, and or \ncontraband; (3) whethcr the strip searches arc conducted in an area of privacy so that the searchcs \ncannot be observed by persons not participating in the scarchcs; (4) whethcr DAC J DC officers may \nlawfully perform strip searches and/or body cavity searches without reasonable suspicion, based on \nspecific and articulable facts, to believe any particular detaince has concealed drugs. weapons or \ncontraband; (5) whethcr strip searches and/or body cavity searches lllay lawfully be conductcd in \nareas wherc the search can be observed by peoplc not participating in the search; and (6) whether \nor not Dcfendants' strip search policy and procedure is in accordance with the State and Federal \nConstitutions. \n24.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \nthereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respcct \nto the class as a whole. \n25.  There is a well-defined community of interest amongst members of the class.  Thc \nclaims of the named Plaintiff are typical of the claims of the members of the class.  The factual \nbases of Defendants' misconduct are common to all class members and reprcsent a common \npolicy, practice and/or custom of blanket strip searches of detainees without r~asollable suspicion. \n8 \n\nMorcover, PlaintitTs claims arc based on the same legal theories as those of the class members. \n26.  The named Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nPlaintifris committed to prosecuting this action, and she has retained competcnt counsel \nexperienced in civil litigation of this nature.  Moreover, the interests of Plaintiff are coincident \nwith. and not antagonistic to, those of the other members of the class. \n27.  The common questions of law and fact herein predominate over questions affecting \nany individual class member, and class action treatment provides a superior mdhod for the fair and \ncfficient adjudication or the controversy. \n28.  At all times relevant to thc acts allegcd hercin, and as to every cause of action \nassertcd, Defendants acted traudulently, oppressively, maliciously, and in knowing and conscious \ndisregard of Plaintiffs rights and thc rights of class members, as outlined herein. \nV. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Civil Rights Violations Under 42 U.S.c. § 1983) \n29.  Plainti rf incorporates by rcference into her first cause of action the allegations of \nparagraphs I through 28 above. as fully as irrealleged and set tarth herein. \n30.  The above-described acts and omissions of Defendants were unreasonable. shocking \nto the conscience. and were committed intentionally. maliciously. willfully and/or with reckless or \ndeliberate indifference, and in violation orthe following clearly established constitutional rights or \nwhich a reasonable person would have been aware: \n(a)  Plaintiffs and class members' Fourth Amendment rights to be free from \nunreasonable searches and seizurcs; and \n(b)  Plaintiffs and class members' Eighth Amcndmcnt rights to be free from cruel and \n9 \n\nunusual punishment and/or Fourtccnth Amendment rights to substantive and \nprocedural due process, and to privacy. \n31.  The above-described acts and omissions of Defendants were motivated by evil \nmotive and intent, and involved recklessness and callous indifference to Plaintiff and class \nmembers' federally protected rights, justifying an award of punitive damages. \n32.  Prior to the acts and omissions alleged herein, Defendants rai led to properly create, \nadopt, inculcate and ensure compliancc with appropriate policies and procedures for corrections \nofficers and supervisory personnel employed by them; failed to propcrly train, monitor, supervise \nand discipline corrections officers and supervisory pcrsonnel employed by thcm, and failed to \notherwise institute and ensure compliance with adequate procedures and policies that would \nprotect the rights of Plaintiff and class membcr~. These acts and omissions were direct and \nproximate causes ofthc injuries complained of by Plaintiffhcrcin. as set forth below. \n33.  Defendants Dona Ana County, Barela. Wooley. Soliz and/or Roach maintained a \ncustom or policy which pcmlittcd or condoned the foregoing violations of Plaintiffs and class \nmembers' constitutional rights. \n34.  Thc acts and omissions of the Defendants as set forth above were undertaken under \ncolor of state law and operated to deprivc Plaintiff and the members of the class of their federal \nrights.  Defendants Barela, Woolcy, Soliz and Roach are liahle in their individual and official \ncapacities for damages proximately caused by these acts and omissions.  Plaintiff is also entitled to \ninjunctive relief against the Defendants, including a pemlanent injunction prohibiting Defendants \nfrom engaging in the unlawful practices and procedures complained of herein. \n35.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendants' violations of her constitutional \n10 \n\nrights. Plaintiff and memhers of the class suffered damages as set forth below. \nVI. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Claims Arising Under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act) \n36.  Plainti ff incorporates by reference into her second cause of action the allegations of \nparagraphs I through 35 ahove. as fully as if realleged and set forth herein. \n37.  The conduct of Dcfendants. described above. resulted in personal injury and bodily \ninjury to Plaintiff and members of the class resulting from assault. battery, false imprisonment. \nand/or deprivation of rights. privileges or immunity secured by the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States and f',;cw Mexico. \n38.  Defendants Barela, Wooley. Soliz and Roach. as supervisors ofDACJDC officers. \nhad the duty in any activity actually undertaken by them to exercise for the saf(:!y of others that \ncare ordinarily exercised by a reasonable, prudent and qualified law enforcement supervisor in light \nof the nature of what was heing done.  In addition, Defendants Barela, Wooley. Soliz and Roach \nhad a duty to properly screen. hire. train. monitor, supervise and/or discipline employees of \nDACJDC.  Deftmdants Barela, Wooley. Soliz and Roach knew or reasonably should have known \nof the information described ahove. \n39.  Defendants Barela. Wooley. Soliz and Roach breached the foregoing duties hy \nfailing to properly screen. hire. train. monitor, supervise and/or discipline employees of DACJDC, \nand by failing to adopt and ensure compliance with appropriate policies, practices. and customs. hy \nfailing to implement appropriate supplemental training. by failing to appropriately discipline \nsubordinate officers, and by failing to take other appropriate and usual supervisory actions to \ncorrect the problems and to prevent the ham1 which resulted to Plaintiff and memhers of the class \n11 \n\nas a result of the misconduct of Defendants. described above. \n40.  Dona Ana County is the governmental entity which had immcdiate supervisory \nresponsihility over the actions of employees of the DACmc, including but not limited to \nDefcndants Barela. Woolcy. Soliz and Roach.  Therefore. Dona Ana County is jointly and \nseverally liable for all injuries and damages caused by the negligence of any of its officials or \ncmployees under the doctrine of vicarious liability. \n41.  The conduct of Defendants was a direct and proximate calise of the injuries and \ndamages to Plaintiff and members of the class as set forth below. \n42.  All of the acts or omissions which constitute the basis for liability herein come \nwithin the scope of the waivers ofiml1lllnity contained within the New Mexico Tort Claims Act. \n43.  To the extcnt required. Dcfendants have received written notice of the claims \ncontained herein in compliance with the New Mexico Tort Claims Act. ~41-4-16(A)-(C) I\\'MSA \n1978, as amended. \n44.  As a direct and proximate calise of Defendants' conduct. Plaintiff and members of \nthe class suffered damages as sci forth below. \nVII. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Declaratory and Injunctin Relief) \n45.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference into her third cause of action the allegations of \nparagraphs I through 44 above, as fully as ifrealleged and set forth herein. \n46.  Plaintiff. on behalf of herself and the members ofthc class. seeks a judgment \ndeclaring that Defendants must cease the activities described herein and enjoining Defendants from \nany further strip searchcs without individualizcd reasonable suspicion. \n12 \n\n47.  The constitutional violations alleged herein arise from official policies, practices \nand/or customs sanctioned by Defendants.  The ham1 which the Plaintiff and the members of the \nclass have sustained are directly traceable to these officially sanctioned policies, practices, and/or \ncustoms. \n48.  Plaintiff and members of the class do not have a plain, adequate, speedy. or \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs alleged in this Complaint. and they will suffer \nirreparable injury as a result of Defendants' misconduct unless injunctive and declaratory reliefis \ngranted.  Plaintiff and members of the class are in real and immediate danger of sustaining future, \ndirect injury as a result of Dcfendants' official policies. practices and customs that are ongoing at \nthe time of this suit. \n49.  No cognizable burden will be placed on Defendants by requiring that no strip \nsearches be undertaken without individualized reasonable suspicion.  The public interest would be \ngreatly enhanced by enforcement of policies and practices which adhere to the requirements of the \nstate and federal Constitutions.  Absent injunctive relief. there is no guarantee that the Defendants \nwill cease their illegal policies. practices and customs as alleged herein. \n50.  By reason of the foregoing, Plaintiff and members of the class are entitled to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief as set forth above. \nVIll. \nDAMAGES \n51.  Paragraphs I through 50. above. are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set \nforth in this paragraph. \n52.

Defendants' acts and omissions. as set forth herein. were malicious, reckless. \nwanton. oppressive. and/or fraudulent. justifying an award of punitive damages against the \nindividually named Defendants in their personal capacities. for the purpose of punishment and to \ndeter others from the commission of like offenses. \nWHEREFORE. Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and the members of the class represented \nherein, respectfully prays for and demands judgment against the Defendants as follows: \n(a)  For jUdgment against Defendants for compensatory damages. special damages, \nconsequcntial damages and incidental damages under any or all of the causes of action. in an \namount to he determined at the trial of this cause; \n(b)  For judgment dcclaring the rights of the parties; \n(c)  For injunctive relief; \n(d)  For reasonahle attorneys' fees and costs incurred herein; \n(e)  For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest in amounts to he determined according \nto law; \n(I)  For an award of punitive and exemplary damages, in an amount to he detenllined at \nthe trial of this cause; and \n(g)  For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n14 \n\nJURY TRIAL REQUEST \nCOMES :-.lOW Plaintin: by and through her counsel, helow-listed, on her own behalf and \non behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, and herehy demands trial by jury pursuant to the \ntemls and conditions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 38 in regard to all issues in the ahove-referenced cause. \nRespectfully submitted, \nLILLEY LA W OFFICES \n'L'11, \ni \nBy:  ~ t-\nMiChael W.
