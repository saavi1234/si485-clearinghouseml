The plaintiffs challenged the Contra Costa County and Contra Costa County Probation Department policy of subjecting juveniles to multiple strip and/or visual body cavity searches.  Represented by private attorneys, the plaintiffs alleged that pursuant to the defendants' policies, juvenile detainees in their custody were subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches before they appeared at a detention hearing and without having any reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.  The plaintiffs sought monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.  </p><p>The complaint was amended on September 16, 2005 and alleged claims for: 1) violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 2) violation of California's Bane Act, California Civil Code section 52.1(a) and Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code section 52.1(b), based on alleged use of coercion to deprive Plaintiffs of their rights under article I, section 1, of the California Constitution and California Penal Code section 4030; 3) violation of California Penal Code section 4030.</p><p>The plaintiffs subsequently moved for class certification.  The defendants opposed certification and moved for summary judgment.</p><p>On December 5, 2007, the District Court (Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero) denied defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs' federal claims, but dismissed the state law claims.   Judge Spero certified the case as a class action, defining the class as:</p><p>Class One: All juveniles admitted and housed at Contra Costa County Juvenile Hall during the class period who were strip-searched at intake pursuant to defendants' blanket policy and practice of strip-searching all such juveniles prior to their detention hearings, except for: 1) those who were strip-searched at intake after being admitted for an alleged violation (felony or misdemeanor) involving violence, drugs, or weapons; 2) those who were strip-searched at intake because of a reasonable suspicion that such strip search would be productive of contraband; 3) those who had a prior history of being booked on offenses involving drugs, weapons, or violence; 4) those who were subject to parole or probationary search conditions at the time of the strip search; and 5) those who were transferred from another detention facility and thus were not under the constant supervision of a Contra Costa County employee. </p><p>Class Two: All juvenile arrestees in Class One who were strip-searched after visits or court appearances, prior to the detention hearing, during the class period. </p><p>The class period for both classes was defined as \"all persons who are currently juveniles or who reached the age of majority within two years of filing this action and who were subjected to a strip search at Contra Costa County Juvenile Hall before September 15, 2005.\"   Moyle v. County of Contra Costa, 2007 WL 4287315 (N.D.Cal. Dec 05, 2007).</p><p>In September 2009, the parties reached a settlement agreement, and on September 8, 2009, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.  The defendants agreed to implement a revised search policy.  The defendants agreed to pay $100,000 to the class representative and $800,000 in attorney's fees and costs.  The defendants also agreed to pay a total of $700,000 for the claims of the class members in accordance with the claims processing procedure established in the settlement.  The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. </p><p>In 2014, the parties negotiated and filed a motion to modify the order and judgment of dismissal regarding administration of the remaining funds for payments to class members.  On April 29, 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion.  The court ordered the plaintiffs to file a status report in two years regarding their progress toward locating the remaining class members who had yet to be paid.  The plaintiffs spent those two years searching for additional class members to be paid. </p><p>On April 4, 2016, the plaintiffs filed the requested status report.  The plaintiffs had been able to locate and make payments to five additional class members, but roughly $13,000 remained in the fund.  On April 18, Judge Spero ordered the remaining funds be distributed to Loaves and Fishes, an organization that provided community based food</p><p>programs and partner services. The case is now closed.</p>",

Class action plaintiffs are all those similarly situated juveniles who were \n3 \nsubjected  by  defendants  to  pre-detention  hearing  strip  and/or  visual  body  cavity \n4 \nsearches without defendants having a reasonable suspicion that the searches would \n5 \nbe productive of contraband or weapons and who have not yet reached adulthood or \n6 \nwho have turned 18 within two years of the filing of this complaint. \n7 \n13.  On December 30, 2004, plaintiff, on his own behalf, and on behalf of a \n8 \nclass  of  similarly  situated  individuals  filed  a  Juvenile  Class  Government  Claim \n9 \npursuant to California Government Code § 910 against CONTRA COSTA COUNTY; \n10 \nCONTRA  COSTA  COUNTY  PROBATION  DEPARTMENT;  CONTRA  COSTA \n11 \nCOUNTY CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER LIONEL CHATMAN, and CONTRA COSTA \n12 \nCOUNTY  CHIEF  DEPUTY  PROBATION  OFFICER  FOR  JUVENILE  HALL,  JIM \n13 \nMATHERON, and DOES 1 through 100.  On February 8, 2005, the Contra Costa \n14  Board of Supervisors denied the claim and on February 9, 2005, a Deputy County \n15  Clerk mailed the Notice of Denial to Plaintiff’s counsel.    \n16  FACTS \n17  14.  In or about August 26, 2004, plaintiff RUSSELL MOYLE, a minor, was \narrested and transported to Juvenile Hall in the County of Contra Costa, California, \n18 \nand there, prior to a detention hearing, was subjected to visual body cavity searches in \n19 \nviolation of California Penal Code § 4030, the state constitution’s guarantee of the right \n20 \nof privacy, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n21 \nand the Bane Act  (Civil Code § 52.1). \n22 \n15.  Each and every time that claimant left his housing unit within Juvenile \n23 \nHall,  upon  his  return,  he  was  subjected  to  a  visual  body  cavity  search.    These \n24 \nsearches occurred after claimant visited with his parents, his lawyer, and every other \n25 \ntime he left his housing unit.  The strip searches were performed without particularized \n26 \nreasonable  suspicion  that  the  searches  would  be  productive  of  contraband  or \n27 \nweapons.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants had \n28 \nno reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search of plaintiff would \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants \nroutinely follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-detention hearing \n3 \njuvenile  detainees,  including  plaintiff,  to  strip  and  visual  body  cavity  searches, \n4 \nindividually and in groups, without having a reasonable suspicion that the searches will \n5 \nbe productive of contraband or weapons.   \n6 \n17.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants \n7 \nhave the ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who \n8 \nare still juveniles or who were juveniles within two years of the filing of this complaint \n9 \nand  who,  while  in  defendants’  custody  at  Juvenile  Hall  were  subjected  to  strip \n10 \nsearches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to appearing at a detention hearing \n11 \nwithout defendants first having a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be \n12 \nproductive of contraband or weapons. \n13 \n18.  Defendants  CHATMAN  and  MATHERON  and  defendants  DOES  1 \n14  through 10 are jointly and severally personally responsible for the promulgation and \n15  continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which plaintiff \n16  herein and the persons in the class plaintiff purports to represent were subjected to the \n17  searches complained of herein. \n19.  As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, \n18 \nplaintiff, and all those similarly situated, have suffered physical, mental, and emotional \n19 \ndistress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and federal and state \n20 \nstatutory and constitutional rights, and are entitled to recover damages according to \n21 \nproof, including exemplary damages. \n22 \nCLASS CLAIMS \n23 \n20.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiff, and all those \n24 \nsimilarly situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and \n25 \ncustoms of defendants, and each of them.  The searches complained of herein were \n26 \nperformed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense for which plaintiff, and \n27 \neach of those similarly situated, had been arrested, without regard to whether or not \n28 \nplaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, was eligible for release under Welfare & \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Furthermore, the searches complained of herein \n2  were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that plaintiff, or those \nsimilarly  situated,  so  searched  possessed  weapons  or  contraband,  or  that  there \n3 \nexisted  facts  supporting  a  reasonable  belief  that  the  searches  would  produce \n4 \ncontraband.  \n5 \n21.  Plaintiff brings this action on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons \n6 \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n7 \n22.  The class is defined to include all persons who are currently juveniles or \n8 \nwho reached the age of majority within two years of filing of this complaint, and who \n9 \nwere arrested and subjected to a pre-detention hearing strip and/or visual body cavity \n10 \nsearch at Juvenile Hall without defendants having a reasonable suspicion that the \n11 \nsearches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n12 \n23.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n13 \nmembers of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  \n14  Plaintiff does not know the exact number of class members.  Plaintiff is informed and \n15  believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are more than 25 persons per day who are \n16  arrested  by  defendants  and/or  in  the  custody of defendants and subjected to the \n17  searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom \nrelating to said searches.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that \n18 \nthere are thousands of persons in the proposed class. \n19 \n24.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff \n20 \nis informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact \n21 \ncommon to the class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely \n22 \nsubject all juveniles arrested to visual body cavity searches prior to appearance at a \n23 \ndetention hearing; (2) whether persons are subjected to visual body cavity searches \n24 \nprior to detention hearings without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on \n25 \nspecific or articulable facts, to believes any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, \n26 \nweapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a \n27 \nvisual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted \n28 \nin  an  area  of  privacy  so  that  the  searches  cannot  be  observed  by  persons  not \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff \n7 \nis informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law \n8 \ncommon to the class including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may \n9 \nperform  visual  body  cavity  searches  on  juveniles  prior  to  their  detention  hearing \n10 \nwithout reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believes any \n11 \nparticular detainee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which would \n12 \nlikely  be  discovered  by  a  visual  body  cavity  search;  (2)  whether  defendants  may \n13 \nperform visual body cavity searches on juveniles without first reasonably relating the \n14  use of the visual body cavity search to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the \n15  security of the juvenile detention facility and determining if there is a less intrusive \n16  method  to  protect  that  interest;  (3)  whether  visual  body  cavity  searches  may  be \n17  conducted in areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in \nthe search without violating plaintiff’s Federal and State constitutional rights; and, (4) \n18 \nwhether or not defendants’ strip search policy and procedure is in accordance with the \n19 \nlaws of the State of California and the State and Federal Constitutions. \n20 \n26.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n21 \nclaims of the representative plaintiff are typical of the class.  Plaintiff was subjected to \n22 \na strip and visual body cavity search, prior to his detention hearing, without reasonable \n23 \nsuspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or \n24 \ncontraband.  Representative plaintiff has the same interests and suffered the same \n25 \ntype  of  injuries  as  all  of  the  class  members.    Plaintiff’s  claims  arose  because  of \n26 \ndefendants’ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual \n27 \nbody  cavity  searches  prior  to  detention  hearings  without  having,  and  recording  in \n28 \nwriting, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Plaintiff’s claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of \n2  the class members.  Each class member suffered actual damages as a result of being \nsubjected to a strip or visual body cavity search.  The actual damages suffered by \n3 \nrepresentative plaintiff are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered \n4 \nby each class member, in that each member of the class is entitled to minimum \n5 \ndamages of $1,000 under Penal Code Section 4030(p) and $4,000 under Civil Code \n6 \nSection 52(a). \n7 \n27.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n8 \nrepresentative plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiff’s \n9 \ninterests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   \n10 \n28.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \n11 \nprosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n12 \nrisk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \n13 \nclass would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the \n14  class.   \n15  29.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \n16  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n17  risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which \nwould, as a practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other \n18 \nmembers of the class to protect their interests. \n19 \n30.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(2), \n20 \nplaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have acted \n21 \non grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final \n22 \ninjunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.   \n23 \n31.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this \n24 \nclass  action  is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  equitable \n25 \nadjudication of the controversy between the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, \n26 \nand  thereupon  alleges,  that  the  interests  of  members  of  the  class  in  individually \n27 \ncontrolling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class members \n28 \nwould be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.

Plaintiff is informed and believes, and \nthereupon alleges, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \n3 \nrepresent them.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is \n4 \ndesirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the \n5 \nsame location; i.e., CONTRA COSTA COUNTY.  It will promote judicial efficiency to \n6 \nresolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple \n7 \ncourts.   \n8 \n32.  Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff \n9 \nis  informed  and  believes,  and  thereupon  alleges,  that  the  identities  of  the  class \n10 \nmembers  may  be  ascertained  from  records  maintained  by  CONTRA  COSTA \n11 \nCOUNTY, defendant CONTRA COSTA COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT, and \n12 \ndefendants  CHATMAN  and  MATHERON.    Plaintiff  is  informed  and  believes,  and \n13 \nthereupon alleges, that defendants’ records reflect the identities, including addresses \n14  and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in the Juvenile \n15  Hall.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records maintained \n16  by defendants reflect who was subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, \n17  when  the  search  occurred,  where  the  search  occurred,  whether  any  reasonable \nsuspicion  for  the  search  existed,  when  persons  searched  appeared  at  detention \n18 \nhearings, and the charges on which such persons were arrested.  Plaintiff is informed \n19 \nand believes, and thereupon alleges, that all of the foregoing information is contained \n20 \nin defendants’ computer system and that the information necessary to identify the \n21 \nclass members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests \n22 \nand/or release from custody, is readily available from said computer system.   \n23 \n33.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class \n24 \nmembers must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, \n25 \nincluding individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable \n26 \neffort.    Plaintiff  is  informed  and  believes,  and  thereupon  alleges,  that  defendants’ \n27 \ncomputer  records  contain  a  last  known  address  for  class  members.

Spero, Magistrate Judge presiding.  Plaintiff Class was \n26 represented by Class Counsel Mark E. Merin of the Law Office of Mark E.

On September 18, 2009, this Court entered its order preliminarily approving settlement of \n9 the above-captioned class action.  Since the entry of the Court=s Preliminary Order, in accordance with \n10 the Stipulation of Settlement as proved to the satisfaction of the Court, the requisite notice of the \n11 Settlement, with opt-out and objection information, was published in the Contra Costa Times and the \n12 West County Times on November 5, 11, and 18, 2009.  The notice of the Settlement and approved claim \n13 forms, were posted by First Class Mail to the last-known address of each person in the Settlement Class.  \n14 Both the published notice and the mailed notice specified that Claim Forms had to be delivered to the \n15 Claims Administrator, postmarked no later than January 19, 2010.  \n2.  Both the published and mailed notices specified that any person who chooses to object to \n16\nthe Settlement, either personally or through counsel, and desired to appear at the Fairness Hearing, was \n17\nrequired to submit a Notice of Intention to appear, together with written arguments in support of any \n18\nobjection, by January 19, 2010.  No objections have been received by counsel or filed with the Court.   \n19\n3.  The  Court  is  satisfied  from  all  of  the  memoranda  of  law,  declarations,  and  exhibits \n20\nsubmitted to the Court, that the Stipulation of Settlement is fair, and the Court now finds for the reasons \n21\nstated on the record at the hearing on March 19, 2010, that the Stipulation of Settlement is fair and finally \n22\napproves it as such.  The Stipulation of Settlement is incorporated herein by this reference as if set out in \n23\nfull. \n24\n4.  The “Settlement Class” means all of those persons who are members of the following \n25\ndefined class: \n26\nAll SCMs who were booked at Contra Costa County Juvenile Hall during \n27\nthe class period who were strip-searched at intake pursuant to Contra Costa \nCounty’s policy and practice of strip-searching all such juveniles prior to \n28\ntheir detention hearings, except for: 1) those who were strip-searched at \n2\n \nPROPOSED ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nMoyle, et al. vs. Contra Costa County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 05-02324 JCS \n\nCase3:05-cv-02324-JCS   Document145    Filed02/19/10   Page3 of 4\n \n1 intake after being admitted for an alleged violation (felony or \nmisdemeanor) involving violence, drugs, or weapons; 2) those who had a \n2 prior history of being booked on offenses involving drugs, weapons, or \nviolence; 3) those who were subject to parole or probationary search \n3 conditions at the time of the strip search; and 4) those who were transferred \nfrom another detention facility and thus were not under the constant \n4 supervision of a Contra Costa County employee. \n5 5.  Persons who previously commenced civil litigation challenging the legality of any strip \n6 search at the Contra Costa County Juvenile Hall during the class period and have prevailed, settled or had \n7 their complaints denied on their merits, and persons who have given timely notice of their election to be \n8 excluded from the Settlement Class are not included in the Settlement Class. \n9 6.  All claims and complaints of the named Representative Plaintiff, together with all persons \n10 in the Settlement Class, are now dismissed with prejudice as to all of the Released Persons, defined to \n11 include all Defendants, their predecessors, successors, and/or assigns, together with past, present and \n12 future officials, employees, representatives, attorneys and/or agents of the County of Contra Costa.  \n13 Claims and complaints of such persons are now forever barred, and all Settlement Class Members are \n14 enjoined from asserting against any Released Persons any and all claims which the Settlement Class \n15 Members had, have, or may have in the future arising out of the facts alleged in the complaint. \n16 7.  Each Released Person is released from the claims which any Settlement Class Member \n17 has had or may in the future have against any such Released Persons arising out of the facts in the \n18 complaint.   \n19 8.  This Court explicitly finds that the Stipulation of Settlement, which is now made final by \nthis Judgment, was entered into in good faith, is fair and reasonable, and adequate, and is in the best \n20\ninterest of the Class.  The Court expressly finds the amount of attorney’s fees and costs sought to be fair \n21\nand reasonable and expressly approves payment to class counsel, Mark E. Merin of the Law Office of \n22\nMark E. Merin and Andrew C. Schwartz of the firm Casper, Meadows, Schwartz & Cook, in the amount \n23\nof Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($800,000), as and for attorney fees and reimbursement of costs, for \n24\nthe representation of Settlement Class Members herein, to be paid as provided in the Stipulation of \n25\nSettlement. \n26\n9.  The Court further explicitly approves payment from the payment fund of a total of  One \n27\nHundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) to be distributed to the Representative Plaintiff, Katherine \n28\n3\n \nPROPOSED ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nMoyle, et al. vs. Contra Costa County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 05-02324 JCS \n\nCase3:05-cv-02324-JCS   Document145    Filed02/19/10   Page4 of 4\n \n1 Ermitano, as specified in the Stipulation of Settlement.  The Court finds the amount is fair and adequate \n2 in view of the damages suffered by the Representative Plaintiff and the efforts she expended in litigating \n3 this case in the more than five years from the time the original claim was filed.   \n4 10.  Claims have been submitted and, in accordance with the claims processing procedure \n5 specified in the Stipulation of Settlement, will be reviewed, valued, and paid by the Claims Administrator \n6 from funds provided by the Defendants as soon as practicable following the effective date of this \n7 Judgment, meaning the date it is entered and becomes final, but in any event no later than 30 days after \n8 notification by the Claims Administrator that they have evaluated all the claims received and are ready to \n9 disburse settlement.  Such Judgment will be deemed final only upon the expiration of the time to appeal \n10 or, if a notice of appeal is filed in this matter, upon exhaustion of all appeals and petitions for writ of \n11 certiorari. \n12 11.  The Court reserves continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the parties in this action, \n13 including Defendants and all Settlement Class Members, to administer, supervise, construe and enforce \n14 the Settlement in accordance with the terms for the mutual benefit of all of the parties. \n15 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the complaint in this action be \ndismissed with prejudice and that judgment be and the same hereby is entered pursuant to the terms of \n16\nthis Order. \n17\nDated: ____________________  ______________________________________                            \n18\nHON.

Class action plaintiffs are all those similarly situated juveniles who were \n8 \nsubjected  by  defendants  to  pre-detention  hearing  strip  and/or  visual  body  cavity \n9 \nsearches without defendants having a reasonable suspicion that the searches would \n10 \nbe productive of contraband or weapons and who have not yet reached adulthood or \n11 \nwho have turned 18 within two years of the filing of this action.  \n12 \n13.  On December 30, 2004, plaintiff RUSSELL MOYLE, on his own behalf, \n13 \nand  on  behalf  of  a  class  of  similarly  situated  individuals  filed  a  Juvenile  Class \n14  Government Claim pursuant to California Government Code § 910 against CONTRA \n15  COSTA  COUNTY;  CONTRA  COSTA  COUNTY  PROBATION  DEPARTMENT; \n16  CONTRA COSTA COUNTY CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER LIONEL CHATMAN, and \n17  CONTRA COSTA COUNTY CHIEF DEPUTY PROBATION OFFICER FOR JUVENILE \nHALL, JIM MATHERON, and DOES 1 through 100.

In or about August 26, 2004, plaintiff RUSSELL MOYLE, a minor, was \narrested and transported to Juvenile Hall in the County of Contra Costa, California, \n3 \nand there, prior to a detention hearing, was subjected to visual body cavity searches in \n4 \nviolation of California Penal Code § 4030, the California state constitution’s guarantee \n5 \nof the right of privacy, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n6 \nConstitution and the Bane Act  (Civil Code § 52.1). \n7 \n16.  Each and every time that plaintiff RUSSELL MOYLE left his housing unit \n8 \nwithin Juvenile Hall, upon his return, he was subjected to a visual body cavity search.  \n9 \nThese searches occurred after claimant visited with his parents, his lawyer, and every \n10 \nother  time  he  left  his  housing  unit.    The  strip  searches  were  performed  without \n11 \nparticularized  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  searches  would  be  productive  of \n12 \ncontraband or weapons.  Plaintiff RUSSELL MOYLE is informed and believes, and \n13 \nthereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual \n14  body cavity search of plaintiff would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons. \n15  17.  On or about May 25, 2005, plaintiff KATHERINE ERMITANO, a minor, \n16  was  arrested  and  transported  to  Juvenile  Hall  in  the  County  of  Contra  Costa, \n17  California, and there, prior to a detention hearing, was subjected to visual body cavity \nsearches  in  violation  of  California  Penal  Code  §  4030,  the  state  constitution’s \n18 \nguarantee of the right of privacy, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \n19 \nStates Constitution and the Bane Act (Civil Code § 52.1). \n20 \n18.  Each  and  every  time  that  plaintiff  KATHERINE  ERMITANO  left  her \n21 \nhousing unit within Juvenile Hall, upon her return, she was subjected to a visual body \n22 \ncavity search.  These searches occurred after claimant visited with her parents, her \n23 \nlawyer, after a court appearance, and every other time she left her housing unit.  The \n24 \nstrip searches were performed without particularized reasonable suspicion that the \n25 \nsearches  would  be  productive  of  contraband  or  weapons.    Plaintiff  KATHERINE \n26 \nERMITANO is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants had no \n27 \nreasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search of plaintiff would result in \n28 \nthe discovery of contraband or weapons. \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants \n2  routinely follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-detention hearing \njuvenile  detainees,  including  plaintiffs,  to  strip  and  visual  body  cavity  searches, \n3 \nindividually and in groups, without having a reasonable suspicion that the searches will \n4 \nbe productive of contraband or weapons.   \n5 \n20.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants \n6 \nhave the ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who \n7 \nare still juveniles or who were juveniles within two years of the filing of this action and \n8 \nwho, while in defendants’ custody at Juvenile Hall were subjected to strip searches \n9 \nand/or visual body cavity searches prior to appearing at a detention hearing without \n10 \ndefendants first having a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive \n11 \nof contraband or weapons. \n12 \n21.  Defendants CHATMAN and MILLER and defendants DOES 1 through 10 \n13 \nare jointly and severally personally responsible for the promulgation and continuation \n14  of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which plaintiffs herein and \n15  the persons in the class plaintiffs purport to represent were subjected to the searches \n16  complained of herein. \n17  22.  As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, \nplaintiffs,  and  all  those  similarly  situated,  have  suffered  physical,  mental,  and \n18 \nemotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and federal \n19 \nand  state  statutory  and  constitutional  rights,  and  are  entitled  to  recover  damages \n20 \naccording to proof, including exemplary damages. \n21 \nCLASS CLAIMS \n22 \n23.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs, and all those \n23 \nsimilarly situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and \n24 \ncustoms of defendants, and each of them.  The searches complained of herein were \n25 \nperformed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense for which plaintiffs, and \n26 \neach of those similarly situated, had been arrested, without regard to whether or not \n27 \neach  plaintiff,  and  each  of  those  similarly  situated,  was  eligible  for  release  under \n28 \nWelfare & Institutions Code §§ 628 et seq.  Furthermore, the searches complained of \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N. California Blvd., \nSuite 1020 \nWalnut Creek, CA  94596  Moyle vs. Contra Costa County, et al .

Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons \n5 \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n6 \n25.  The class is defined to include all persons who are currently juveniles or \n7 \nwho reached the age of majority within two years of filing of this action, and who were \n8 \narrested  and  subjected  to  a  pre-detention  hearing  strip  and/or  visual  body  cavity \n9 \nsearch at Juvenile Hall without defendants having a reasonable suspicion that the \n10 \nsearches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n11 \n26.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n12 \nmembers of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  \n13 \nPlaintiffs do not know the exact number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n14  believe, and thereupon allege, that there are more than 25 persons per day who are \n15  arrested  by  defendants  and/or  in  the  custody of defendants and subjected to the \n16  searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom \n17  relating to said searches.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, \nthat there are thousands of persons in the proposed class. \n18 \n27.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(a), \n19 \nplaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  there  are  many \n20 \nquestions  of  fact  common  to  the  class  including,  but  not  limited  to:  (1)  whether \n21 \ndefendants routinely subject all juveniles arrested to visual body cavity searches prior \n22 \nto appearance at a detention hearing; (2) whether persons are subjected to visual \n23 \nbody cavity searches prior to detention hearings without there being any reasonable \n24 \nsuspicion, based on specific or articulable facts; to believe any particular arrestee has \n25 \nconcealed  drugs,  weapons,  and/or  contraband  in  bodily  cavities  which  could  be \n26 \ndetected by means of a visual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity \n27 \nsearches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed \n28 \nby  persons  not  participating  in  the  searches,  or  whether  the  visual  body  cavity \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(a), \n6 \nplaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  there  are  many \n7 \nquestions of law common to the class including, but are not limited to: (1) whether \n8 \ndefendants  may  perform  visual  body  cavity  searches  on  juveniles  prior  to  their \n9 \ndetention hearing without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, \n10 \nto believe any particular detainee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband \n11 \nwhich  would  likely  be  discovered  by  a  visual  body  cavity  search;  (2)  whether \n12 \ndefendants  may  perform  visual  body  cavity  searches  on  juveniles  without  first \n13 \nreasonably relating the use of the visual body cavity search to defendants’ penological \n14  interest to maintain the security of the juvenile detention facility and determining if \n15  there is a less intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether visual body cavity \n16  searches may be conducted in areas where the search can be observed by people not \n17  participating in the search without violating plaintiffs’ Federal and State constitutional \nrights; and, (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search policy and procedure is in \n18 \naccordance  with  the  laws  of  the  State  of  California  and  the  State  and  Federal \n19 \nConstitutions. \n20 \n29.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n21 \nclaims of the representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were subjected \n22 \nto  a  strip  and  visual  body  cavity  search,  prior  to  his  detention  hearing,  without \n23 \nreasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, \n24 \nweapons  or  contraband.    Representative  plaintiffs  have  the  same  interests  and \n25 \nsuffered the same type of injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose \n26 \nbecause of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip \n27 \nand/or visual body cavity searches prior to detention hearings without having, and \n28 \nrecording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as \n2  the claims of the class members.  Each class member suffered actual damages as a \nresult of being subjected to a strip or visual body cavity search.  The actual damages \n3 \nsuffered  by  representative  plaintiffs  are  similar  in  type  and  amount  to  the  actual \n4 \ndamages suffered by each class member, in that each member of the class is entitled \n5 \nto minimum damages of $1,000 under Penal Code Section 4030(p) and $4,000 under \n6 \nCivil Code Section 52(a). \n7 \n30.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n8 \nrepresentative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ \n9 \ninterests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   \n10 \n31.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \n11 \nprosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n12 \nrisk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \n13 \nclass would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the \n14  class.   \n15  32.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \n16  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n17  risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which \nwould, as a practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other \n18 \nmembers of the class to protect their interests. \n19 \n33.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(2), \n20 \nplaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted \n21 \non grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final \n22 \ninjunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.   \n23 \n34.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this \n24 \nclass  action  is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  equitable \n25 \nadjudication  of  the  controversy  between  the  parties.    Plaintiffs  are  informed  and \n26 \nbelieve, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of the class in individually \n27 \ncontrolling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class members \n28 \nwould be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N. California Blvd., \nSuite 1020 \nWalnut Creek, CA  94596  Moyle vs. Contra Costa County, et al .

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \nthereupon allege, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \n3 \nrepresent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is \n4 \ndesirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the \n5 \nsame location; i.e., CONTRA COSTA COUNTY.  It will promote judicial efficiency to \n6 \nresolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple \n7 \ncourts.   \n8 \n35.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs \n9 \nare  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  the  identities  of  the  class \n10 \nmembers  may  be  ascertained  from  records  maintained  by  CONTRA  COSTA \n11 \nCOUNTY, defendant CONTRA COSTA COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT, and \n12 \ndefendants CHATMAN and MATHERON.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \n13 \nthereupon allege, that defendants’ records reflect the identities, including addresses \n14  and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in the Juvenile \n15  Hall.    Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  records \n16  maintained by defendants reflect who was subjected to a strip and/or visual body \n17  cavity search, when the search occurred, where the search occurred, whether any \nreasonable suspicion for the search existed, when persons searched appeared at \n18 \ndetention hearings, and the charges on which such persons were arrested.  Plaintiffs \n19 \nare informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing information is \n20 \ncontained  in  defendants’  computer  system  and  that  the  information  necessary  to \n21 \nidentify the class members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for \n22 \ntheir  arrests  and/or  release  from  custody,  is  readily  available  from  said  computer \n23 \nsystem.   \n24 \n36.

The Revised Policy has been implemented \n19\nand remains in place pending the outcome of certain appeals regarding the constitutionality of blanket \n20\nstrip search policies, including the pending Ninth Circuit en banc review in Bull v. City and County of \n21\nSan Francisco, Case No. 05-17080, D.C. No. CV-03-01840-CRB (9th Cir. hearing en banc on May 26, \n22\n2009.). Copies of the Contra Costa’s Revised Policies relating to the strip search of juveniles at Contra \n23\nCosta County Juvenile Hall are attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  \n24\nWHEREAS on September 16, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint to add a new \n25\nclass  representative,  Plaintiff  KATHERINE  ERMITANO,  at  that  time  a  minor,  challenging  the \n26\nDefendants’ policy of strip searching juveniles at Contra Costa County Juvenile Hall.  Defendants filed a \n27\ntimely answer to the First Amended Complaint denying allegations of wrong doing or liability.  \n28\n\\\\\\ \n2 \nSTIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT \nMoyle, et al. vs. Contra Costa County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 05-02324 JCS \n\nCase 3:05-cv-02324-JCS   Document 123   Filed 09/03/09   Page 3 of 20\n \n1 WHEREAS  the  Parties  entered  into  discovery  which  included  exchange  of  documents, \n2 preparation of and responses to requests for production of documents, on site review of juvenile files, and \n3 taking depositions of the Parties and Defendants’ employees and administrators.  \n4 WHEREAS on December 4, 2007, the Honorable Joseph C. Spero, United States Magistrate \n5 Judge for the Northern District of California, issued an order granting preliminary certification to a class \n6 of juveniles subject to the class definition set forth in that order (the “Certification Order”).  \n7 WHEREAS Plaintiffs voluntary dismissed with prejudice all claims against Defendants Chatman \n8 and Miller, leaving only Contra Costa as the remaining Defendant in this Action.  (See Class Cert. Order \n9 fn. 6 at 10.)   \n10 WHEREAS, on July 8, 2009 and July 9, 2009, the Parties participated in settlement mediation \n11 presided over by the Honorable Fern M. Smith (retired).  At the mediation, Contra Costa and Plaintiffs \n12 reached an agreement on a Term Sheet, which was approved by the Contra Costa Board of Supervisors \n13 on July 21, 2009.  The terms reached at the mediation were to be further clarified and incorporated into \n14 this Stipulation of Settlement which, subject to the approval of the Court, will constitute a final and \n15 binding settlement agreement of all individual and class-wide claims (and related claims) alleged in the \n16 action in the manner and upon the terms set forth below and fully resolves the dispute.   \n17 WHEREAS, at the time of the mediation, the law applicable to the issue of whether Plaintiffs’ \n18 core claim that Contra Costa’s blanket strip search policy violates the Fourth Amendment may be \n19 impacted by on-going appellate proceedings, including the en banc review in Bull v. San Francisco.  As a \n20 result, the Plaintiffs and Contra Costa reached a compromise and agreed that in the event that blanket \n21 strip search policies involving the intake and placing of a juvenile into the general population at juvenile \n22 detention facility are found to be constitutional or the constitutionality of such policies are determined to \n23 be different from that argued by the Plaintiffs or defined by the Court in its Class Certification Order in \n24 this Action, Contra Costa may modify its existing Search Policy or re-implement its prior policy in \n25 compliance with Ninth Circuit or Supreme Court law, and such further revisions and implementation of \n26 those  policies  shall  be  permitted  by  and  incorporated  into  this  agreement  by  subsequent  written \n27 modification to any final settlement agreement reached in this Action.  \n28\n\\\\\\ \n3 \nSTIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT \nMoyle, et al. vs. Contra Costa County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 05-02324 JCS \n\nCase 3:05-cv-02324-JCS   Document 123   Filed 09/03/09   Page 4 of 20\n \n1 WHEREAS, subject to the terms of the original negotiated Term Sheet and approval by the \n2 Contra Costa Board of Supervisors and the Court, the parties desire to enter into a final and binding \n3 settlement that will resolve all claims for relief and causes of action alleged or related to any individual \n4 or class-wide allegations averred in the Second Amended Complaint or Motion for Class Certification, \n5 Contra Costa and Plaintiffs enter into this Stipulation of Settlement. \n6 NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED, by and between the \n7 Parties as follows: \n8\n  II. \n9\n  DEFINITIONS \n10\n1.  “Administrator” means Gilardi and Co., LLC, P.O.

On September 18, 2009, this Court entered its order preliminarily approving settlement of \n9 the above-captioned class action.   Since the entry of the Court =s Preliminary Order, in accordance with \n10 the Stipulation of Settlement as proved to th e satisfaction of the Court, th e requisite notice of the \n11 Settlement, with opt-out and objection inform ation, was published in th e Contra Costa T imes and the \n12 West County Times on November 5, 11, and 18, 2009.  The notice of the Settlement and approved claim \n13 forms, were posted by First Class Mail to the last-known address of each person in the Settlement Class.  \n14 Both the published notice and the m ailed notice specified that Claim Forms had to be deliver ed to the \n15 Claims Administrator, postmarked no later than January 19, 2010.  \n16 2.  Both the published and mailed notices specified that any person who chooses to object to \nthe Settlement, either personally or through counsel, and desired to a ppear at the Fairness Hearing, was \n17\nrequired to submit a Notice of Inten tion to appear, together with wr itten arguments in support of any \n18\nobjection, by January 19, 2010.  No objections have been received by counsel or filed with the Court.   \n19\n3.  The  Court is satisf ied  from  all of  the memoranda  of law, declarations, and exhibits \n20\nsubmitted to the Court, that the Stipulation of Settlement is fair, and the Court now finds for the reasons \n21\nstated on the record at the hearing on March 19, 2010, that the Stipulation of Settlement is fair and finally \n22\napproves it as such.  The Stipulation of Settlement is incorporated herein by this reference as if set out in \n23\nfull. \n24\n4.  The “Settlement Class” means all of thos e persons who are m embers of the following \n25\ndefined class: \n26\nAll SCMs who were booked at Contra Costa County Juvenile Hall during \n27\nthe class period who were strip-searched at intake pursuant to Contra Costa \nCounty’s policy and practice of strip-searching all such juveniles prior to \n28\ntheir detention hearings, except for: 1) those who were strip-searched at \n2 \nPROPOSED ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nMoyle, et al. vs. Contra Costa County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 05-02324 JCS \n\nCase3:05-cv-02324-JCS   Document145    Filed02/19/10   Page3 of 4\n \n1 intake after being admitted for an alleged violation (felony or \nmisdemeanor) involving violence, drugs, or weapons; 2) those who had a \n2 prior history of being booked on offenses involving drugs, weapons, or \nviolence; 3) those who were subject to parole or probationary search \n3 conditions at the time of the strip search; and 4) those who were transferred \nfrom another detention facility and thus were not under the constant \n4 supervision of a Contra Costa County employee. \n5 5.  Persons who previously commenced civil litigation challenging the legality of any strip \n6 search at the Contra Costa County Juvenile Hall during the class period and have prevailed, settled or had \n7 their complaints denied on their merits, and persons who have given timely notice of their election to be \n8 excluded from the Settlement Class are not included in the Settlement Class. \n9 6.  All claims and complaints of the named Representative Plaintiff, together with all persons \n10 in the Settlement Class, are now dism issed with prejudice as to all of the Released Persons, defined to \n11 include all Defendants, their predecessors, successors , and/or assigns, together  with past, present and \n12 future officials, employees, representatives, attorneys and/or agents of the County of Contra Costa.   \n13 Claims and complaints of such persons are now  forever barred, and all Settlem ent Class Members are \n14 enjoined from asserting against any Released Persons any and all c laims which the Settlem ent Class \n15 Members had, have, or may have in the future arising out of the facts alleged in the complaint. \n16 7.  Each Released Person is released from the claims which any Settlem ent Class Member \n17 has had or m ay in the future have against any such  Released Persons arising out of the facts in the \n18 complaint.   \n19 8.  This Court explicitly finds that the Stipulation of Settlement, which is now made final by \nthis Judgment, was entered  into in good faith, is fair and reasonabl e, and adequate, and is in the best \n20\ninterest of the Class.  The Court expressly finds the amount of attorney’s fees and costs sought to be fair \n21\nand reasonable and expressly approves paym ent to class counsel, Mark E. Merin of the Law Office of \n22\nMark E. Merin and Andrew C. Schwartz of the firm Casper, Meadows, Schwartz & Cook, in the amount \n23\nof Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($800,000), as and for attorney fees and reimbursement of costs, for \n24\nthe representation of Settlement Class Members herein, to be paid as provided in the Stipulation of \n25\nSettlement. \n26\n9.  The Court further explicitly approves payment from the payment fund of a total of   One \n27\nHundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) to be distribute d to the Representative Plaintiff, Katherine \n28\n3 \nPROPOSED ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nMoyle, et al. vs. Contra Costa County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 05-02324 JCS \n\nCase3:05-cv-02324-JCS   Document145    Filed02/19/10   Page4 of 4\n \n1 Ermitano, as specified in the Stipulation of Settlement.  The Court finds the amount is fair and adequate \n2 in view of the damages suffered by the Representative Plaintiff and the efforts she expended in litigating \n3 this case in the more than five years from the time the original claim was filed.   \n4 10.  Claims have been sub mitted and, in acco rdance with the claims processing procedure \n5 specified in the Stipulation of Settlement, will be reviewed, valued, and paid by the Claims Administrator \n6 from funds provided by the Defe ndants as soon as pr acticable following the ef fective date of this \n7 Judgment, meaning the date it is entered and becom es final, but in any event no later than 30 days after \n8 notification by the Claims Administrator that they have evaluated all the claims received and are ready to \n9 disburse settlement.  Such Judgment will be deemed final only upon the expiration of the tim e to appeal \n10 or, if a notice of appeal is filed  in this matter, upon exhaustion of al l appeals and petitions for writ of \n11 certiorari. \n12 11.  The Court reserves continuing and exclusive ju risdiction over the parties in this action, \n13 including Defendants and all Settlement Class Members, to administer, supervise, construe and enforce \n14 the Settlement in accordance with the terms for the mutual benefit of all of the parties. \n15 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the complaint in this action be \ndismissed with prejudice and that judgm ent be and the same hereby is entered pursuant to the terms of \n16\nthis Order. \n17\nDated: ____________________  ______________________________________                            \n18\nHON.
