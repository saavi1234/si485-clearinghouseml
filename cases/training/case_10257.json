Merin filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, challenging the Sacramento County and  Sacramento County Probation Department policy of strip searching juveniles at Sacramento County Juvenile Hall.  The Robinson case was filed August 10, 2004  The other case, styled Kozlowski, et al. v. Sacramento County, et al., No. CIV.S.04-2381 FCD/DAD [JI-CA-18 of this collection], was filed on November 5, 2004,  Both cases were declared \"related\" and assigned to the Honorable Frank C. Damrell, Jr.</p><p>Defendants filed answers in both cases generally denying all allegations of wrong doing or liability.  A new strip search policy was instituted on September 29, 2004, to conform with state and federal law.</p><p>After extensive document discovery and depositions, the parties mediated the cases before the Honorable Raul A. Ramirez (retired).  The mediation, which lasted four days, spread out over three months, produced a settlement.  Under the Stipulation for Settlement, the parties agreed that the settlement class consisted of:</p><p>a. All juveniles booked and assigned to a unit at Sacramento County Juvenile Hall and strip searched during the class period (January 1, 1998, through October 1, 2004);</p><p>b. The sub-class of juveniles who were booked on misdemeanor, infraction, ordinance violation, or other non-felony offenses not involving violence, drugs or weapons, assigned to a unit and strip searched during the period of their incarceration;</p><p>c. The sub-class of all juveniles booked at Sacramento County Juvenile Hall on felony charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons who were assigned to a unit and strip searched during the period of their incarceration.</p><p>The County agreed to pay the $4.280 million to settle all class claims.  Of that amount, $1.5 million was allocated as  attorney's fees and reimbursement costs and expenses; $350,000.00 for the costs of claim administration and $280,000.00 for incentive payments to the representative plaintiffs.  The remainder went to pay class claims.  The District Court (Judge Frank C. Damrell) preliminarily approved the settlement on August 11, 2006.  Following a fairness hearing  on March 2, 2007, Judge Damrell entered the final approval order and judgment.</p><p></p>",

On August 11, 2006, this Court entered its order preliminarily approving settlement\n6 of the above-captioned consolidated class action.  Since the entry of the Courtโs Preliminary Order,\n7 in accordance with the Stipulation of Settlem ent as proved to the sat isfaction of the Court, the\n8 requisite notice of the Settlement, with opt-out and objection information, was published in the\n9 Sacramento Bee on September 11, 21, and 24, 2006, in the  Sacramento News and Review on\n10 September 14, 21, and 28, 2006, and in the Comic Press News on October 20, 2006.  The notice of\n11 the Settlement and approved claim forms, were posted by First Class Mail to the last-known address\n12 of each person in the Settlement Class.  Both the published notice and the mailed notice specified\n13 that Claim Forms had to be delivered to the Claims Administrator, postmarked no later than \n14 January 8, 2007. \n15 2.  Both the published and mailed notices specified that any person who chose to object\n16 to the Settlement, either personally or through counsel, and desired to appear at the Fairness\n17 Hearing, was required to submit a Notice of Intention to appear, together with written arguments in\n18 support of any objection, by February 16, 2007.  Now  ritten objections were received by the Court.\n19 Furthermore, although opportunity was given by the Cour t to voice objections at the time of the\n20 Fairness Hearing, no objections were stated by any member of the Class or representative of any\n21 such Class Member.\n22 3. The Court is satisfied from all of the memoranda of law, declarations, and exhibits\n23 submitted to the Court, that the Stipulation of Settlement is, and the C ourt now finds, that the\n24 Stipulation of Settlement is fair and finally approves it as such.  The Stipulation of Settlement is\n25 incorporated herein by this reference as if set out in full.\n26 4. The โSettlement Classโ includes:  all of those persons who are m embers of the\n27 following defined class and/or sub-classes who,d uring the class period from January 1,1998, to and\n28 including October 1, 2004, were booked at Sacramento County Juvenile Hall, assigned to a Unit,\nPage 2\nEMILY ROBINSON, et al. v.

USDC, Eastern District, Case No. CIV.S-04-2381 FCD DAD\n ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL\n\n1 and strip searched at the facility:\n2 a.  All juveniles booked and assigned to a Unit at Sacramento County Juvenile\n3 Hall and strip searched,  including juveniles strip-searched in groups, during\n4 the Class Period;\n5 b.  The sub-class of juveniles who, during the Class Period, were booked  on\n6 misdemeanor, infraction, ordinance violation, or other non-felony offenses\n7 not involving violence, dr ugs or weapons, assigned to a Unit, and strip\n8 searched during the period of their incarceration;\n9 c.  The sub-class of all juveniles who, during the Class Period, were booked at\n10 Sacramento County Juvenile Hall on felony charges not involving violence,\n11 drugs or weapons, assigned to a Unit,a nd strip searched during the period of\n12 their incarceration. \n13 5. Persons who previously commenced civil litigation challenging the legality of any\n14 strip search at the Sacramento County Juvenile Hall during the class period and have prevailed,\n15 settled or had their complaints denied on their merits, and persons who have given timely notice of\n16 their election to be excluded from the Settlement Class are not included in the Settlement Class.\n17 6.  With the exception of the individuals who submitted timely requests to the Court to\n18 opt out of the Stipulation of Settlement, all claims and complaints of the named representative\n19 Plaintiffs, together with all persons in the Settlement Class, are now dismissed with prejudice as to\n20 all of the Released Persons defined to includea ll Defendants, their predecessors, successors, and/or\n21 assigns, together with past, present and future foficials, employees, representatives, attorneys and/or\n22 agents of the County of Sac ramento or Sacramento County Probation Department.  Claims and\n23 complaints of such persons are now forever barred, and all Settlement Class Members are enjoined\n24 from asserting against any released persons anya nd all claims which the Settlement Class Members\n25 had, have, or may have in the future arising out of the facts alleged in the complaints.\n26 7. Each Released Person is released f rom the claims which any Settlem ent Class\n27 Member has had or may in the future have againsta ny such Released Persons arising out of the facts\n28 in the complaints.  \nPage 3\nEMILY ROBINSON, et al. v.

USDC, Eastern District, Case No. CIV.S-04-2381 FCD DAD\n ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL\n\n1 8. This Court explicitly finds that the Stipulation of Settlement, which is now made final\n2 by this Judgment, was entered into in good faith, isr easonable, fair, and adequate, and is in the best\n3 interest of the Class.  The Court expressly approves payment to class counsel, the Law Office of\n4 Mark E. Merin, the amount of One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00),  for\n5 attorney fees, and costs for the representation of Settlement Class Members herein, to be paid as\n6 provided in the Stipulation of Settlement.\n7 9. The Court further explicitly approves payment from the payment fund a total of Two\n8 Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($280,000.00) to bed ivided among the representative Plaintiffs,\n9 as specified in the Stipulation of Settlement.  The Court finds the amount is fair and adequate in\n10 view of the damages suffered by the representativ e Plaintiffs and the efforts they expended in\n11 litigating this case in the more than two and one-half years it has been pending.\n12 10. Claims have been submitted and, in accordance with the claims processing procedure\n13 specified in the Stipulation of  Settlement, will be reviewed, valued, and paid by the Claim s\n14 Administrator from funds provided by the defendants as soon as practicable following the effective\n15 date of this Judgment, meaning the date it is entered and becomes final.  Such Judgment will be\n16 deemed final only upon the expiration of the time to appeal or, if a notice of appeal is filed in this\n17 matter, upon exhaustion of all appeals and petitions for writ of certiorari.\n18 11. The Court reserves continuing and e xclusive jurisdiction over the parties in this\n19 action, including Defendants and all Settlement Class Members, to administer, supervise, construe\n20 and enforce the Settlement in accordance with the terms for the mutual benefit of all of the parties.\n21 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the complaints in these\n22 related actions be dismissed with prejudice and that judgment be and the same hereby is entered\n23 pursuant to the terms of this Order.\n24\n25 Dated: March 2, 2007\n26\n27\n28\nPage 4\nEMILY ROBINSON, et al. v.

The Parties agree to make an application to the Court to appoint the Claims\n2 Administrator as an officer of the Court for the purpose of implementing the terms of the Stipulation\n3 of Settlement.  The Administrator shall be subject to judicial immunity to the fullest extent permitted\n4 by law.\n5 V.\n6 PROCEDURES FOR RECEIVING PAYMENT \nUNDER THIS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\n7\n8 37. All SCMs who were booked at the Sacramento County Juvenile Hall during the Class\n9 Period, assigned to a Unit, and strip searched during the period of their incarceration, upon return\n10 of a verified Claim Form, shall, for each booking up to a maximum of three bookings, receive one\n11 (1) point for having been assigned to a Unit and, additional points, if applicable, as specified below:\n12 a. Five (5) points shall be assigned to each SCM who returns a verified Claim\n13 Form for each booking which led to assignment to a unit during the Claims\n14 Period if, for that booking, the SCM was charged only with a misdemeanor,\n15 infraction, ordinance violation, or other non-felony offense, not involving\n16 violence, drugs or weapons.   If an SCM, in this category, was on searchable\n17 probation at the time of the booking and assignment to a Unit, the number of\n18 additional points assigned to the SCM shall be two (2) for each such booking.\n19 b. For each booking and assignment to a Unit during the Class Period, an SCM\n20 charged with a felony not involving violence, drugs or weapons shall be\n21 assigned an additional three (3) points.  If the SCM, at the time of such\n22 booking and assignment to a Unit, was on searchable probation at the time,\n23 the SCM will receive one (1) additional point for each such booking and Unit\n24 assignment.\n25 c. Claimants may only receive points for only the first 3 bookings at the\n26 Juvenile Hall.\n27 38. The Administrator shall determine whether or not a person who has submitted a\n28 Claim Form is an SCM and shall reject claims by persons who are not SCMs.\nPage 10\nEMILY ROBINSON, et al. v. SACRAMENTO COUNTY, et al. USDC, Eastern District, Case No. CIV.S-04-1617 FCD DAD\nKIMBERLY KOZLOWSKI, et al. v. SACRAMENTO COUNTY, et al. USDC, Eastern District, Case No. CIV.S-04-2381 FCD DAD\nSTIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n\n1 39. The Administrator will determine the total possible points which could be obtained\n2 by the class members if all eligible SCMs filed claims.  At the conclusion of the Claims Period, the\n3 total number of points attributed to all SCMs who submit claims will be totaled and if the total\n4 equals or exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total possible points, the amount of money available for\n5 distribution to the Class Members other than Representative Plaintiffs ($4 million dollars) shall be\n6 divided by the total number of points of SCMโs who submit claims to arrive at the value of each\n7 point.  Each SCMโs claim will then be valued by taking the point value and multiply it by the number\n8 of points assigned to that SCMโs claim.  If the total number of points of SCMโs who submit claims\n9 is less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of possible points which could be obtained if all\n10 class members submitted claims, each point shall be valued at Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and\n11 the claims paid as set out below.  Any unclaimed Funds shall be returned to Defendants or their\n12 designee.\n13 40. All SCMs will receive payments specified herein for each booking and assignment\n14 to a Unit which occurred during the Class Period.  \n15 41. Any SCM who fails to submit a Claim Form completed in accordance with the\n16 instructions contained therein by the Bar Date or any other Court mandated extension, shall be\n17 forever barred from receiving any payment pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement.  Such SCM\n18 shall in all other respects be bound by all of the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, and the\n19 judgment entered herein, including but not limited to the release of all Released Persons of all claims\n20 resolved herein.  \n21 42. The Administrator will determine the point value to be assigned to each eligible SCM\n22 based upon the Administratorโs review of the Claim Forms and the information in the database\n23 provided by Defendants.  \n24 43. Claim Forms of all SCMs who have not attained the age of 18 at the time the Claim\n25 Form is submitted shall be signed by a parent or guardian, or by the minor if the minor does not have\n26 ready access to a parent or guardian at the time the claim form is submitted.  The checks distributed\n27 to the SCMs who have not attained the age of 18 at the time the checks are mailed shall be made out\n28 jointly to the SCM and the parent or guardian, if any, who signs the Claim Form and the parent or\nPage 11\nEMILY ROBINSON, et al. v.

Merin in trust for the SCM and mailed to the Law Office of Mark E. Merin to be held\n5 in trust for that minor until the minor attains the age of eighteen (18) at which time the funds shall\n6 be distributed to the SCM.\n7 VI.\n8 PAYMENT OF DEBTS OWED TO THE COUNTY FROM AWARDS\n9 44. Any award to SCMs shall be subject to any Debts Owed to the County and Court\n10 ordered restitution.  The Defendants shall provide to the Claims Administrator, with a copy to Class\n11 Counsel, a list of all qualified SCMs who have Debts Owed to the County as defined in Paragraph\n12 9 and who submit valid claims, with the amount of the Debt Owed to the County and/or Court\n13 ordered restitution specified.  The Claims Administrator is directed to deduct from each SCMโs\n14 award the amount of the specified Debt Owed to the County, up to a maximum of fifty percent (50%)\n15 of the SCMโs award.  The SCMsโ awards shall be subject to reduction for entire amount of any Court\n16 ordered restitution payments.  The Claims Administrator shall reduce the SCMsโ payments and\n17 forward to Sacramento County the amount of unpaid restitution specified by the Court orders.\n18 Copies of the information related to the restitution and the reduction of claims awards shall be\n19 provided to the SCMs with copies to Class Counsel.  Any SCM may submit a written objection to\n20 the Debt Owed to the County or restitution order within thirty (30) days of the date that settlement\n21 checks are distributed.  The written objection shall specify the grounds for the objection and copies\n22 shall be sent to Class Counsel and Defendants Counsel.

After the bar date (the date by which all claims must be submitted), \nthe total number of points assigned will be divided into $4,000,000.00, and the value of each point determined.  The \nnumber of points assigned to each claimant will be multiplied by the value of a point, and the total amount payable to \neach claimant will be determined.   \n \nEach claimant who was booked at the Sacramento County Juvenile Hall during the class period, assigned to a unit, and \nstrip searched during the period of incarceration, upon return of a verified claim form, will receive one point for \nhaving been assigned to a unit and additional points, if applicable, as follows:   \n \na.  Five (5) points shall be assigned to claimants who return a verified claim form for each booking which led to \nassignment to a unit during the class period if, for that booking, the claimant was charged only with a \nmisdemeanor, infraction, ordinance violation, or other non-felony offense, not involving violence, drugs or \nweapons.  If a claimant, in this category, was on searchable probation at the time of the booking and \nassignment to a unit, the number of additional points assigned to the claimant shall be two (2) for each such \nbooking. \n \nb.  For each booking and assignment to a unit during the class period, a claimant charged with a felony not \ninvolving violence, drugs or weapons shall be assigned an addition three (3) points.  If the claimant, at the \ntime of such booking and assignment to a unit, was on searchable probation at the time, the claimant will \nreceive one (1) additional point for each such booking and unit assignment.   \n  2\n\n \nIf the total number of points assigned to the claims submitted during the claims period is less than ten percent \n(10%) of the total possible points which could be obtained if all settlement class members submitted claims, each \npoint shall be valued at Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00).   \n \nD.  Strip Search Policy \n \nDefendants now have promulgated revised strip search policies regarding the conduct of strip searches which conform \nwith state and federal law.   \n \nE.  Your Options as a Class Member \n \n1.  Be Bound by, and Participate in the Settlement. \n \nTO QUALIFY FOR A PAYMENT you must submit a completed Claim Form to the Claims Administrator. If you \nreceive a notice by First Class Mail, a Claim Form with a self-addressed, stamped return envelope will be included in \nthe notice package. You may also get a Claim Form by: (1) calling this toll free number: 1-800-401-0541; (2) visiting \nthe website www.robinsonvsacco.com; or (3) writing the Claims Administrator at: Juvenile Strip Search Class \nAction, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110.  If you are in custody of \nSacramento County, during the claims period, claim forms and self-addressed envelopes will be available from the \nsupervisors at the institution in which you are incarcerated. \n \nYou have until January 8, 2007, to submit a claim or to opt-out of the settlement. \n \nMail your completed Claim Form to: Sacramento County Juvenile Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims \nAdministrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110. \n \nRemember, if you do not submit a Claim Form, you cannot get a payment. If you submit a claim form, you will be bound by \nthe settlement and receive money (if you are a class member).  If you do not submit a claim form but do not exclude yourself \nfrom the class (as explained in the next paragraph), you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and dismissal entered in \nthis case, but you will not receive any money. \n \nBy participating in this Settlement you will be waiving all your rights to all claims up to and including October 1, 2004, \nrelating to strip searches at the Sacramento County Juvenile Hall, even those of which you are not presently aware.   \n \n2.  Exclude Yourself From the Class \n \nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called โexcludingโ yourself. If you \nexclude yourself, you cannot get a payment and you cannot object to the Settlement. Any Court orders will not apply to you.  \nTo exclude yourself, you must sign a request for exclusion letter that states that you want to be excluded from Robinson, et al. \nv. Sacramento County, et al., United States District Court Case No. CIV.S.04-1617 FCD/PAN and Kozlowski, et al. v. \nSacramento County, et al., United States District Court Case No. CIV.S.04-2381 FCD/DAD.  Your exclusion letter must be \nmailed and postmarked on or before January 8, 2007, to: United States District Court, for the Eastern District of \nCalifornia, 501 I Street, Courtroom 2, Sacramento, CA 95814. \n \nIf you do not follow these instructions properly, you will lose your right to exclude yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you \ncannot get any money from the Settlement of this case and you cannot tell the Court you do not like the Settlement (which is \ncalled โobjectingโ). If you exclude yourself, you are no longer part of the class or the Settlement. But you can sue to be part of \na different lawsuit about the claims in this case. \n \nF.  Fairness Hearing and Process for Objections. \n \nA fairness hearing will be held on March 2, 2007, at 10:00 a.m., at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nCalifornia, 501 I Street, Courtroom 2, Sacramento, California.  If you are a class member and do not exclude yourself, you can \ntell the Court you do not like the Settlement or some part of it at this hearing. This is called objecting to the Settlement. For \nexample, you can say you do not think the Settlement is fair or adequate.  The Court will consider your views.  \n  3\n\n \nTo object, you must send a letter to the court that contains all of the following:  \n \n1.  The name and title of the lawsuit, Robinson, et al. v. Sacramento County, et al., United States District \nCourt Case No. CIV.S.04-1617 FCD/PAN and Kozlowski, et al. v. Sacramento County, et al., United \nStates District Court Case No. CIV.S.04-2381 FCD/DAD; \n \n2.  A statement of each objection you have and the facts that support the objections;  \n \n3.  A description of any law or case supporting the objections;  \n \n4.  A statement on whether or not you or your lawyer will ask to appear at the Fairness Hearing to talk about \nyour objections, and, if so, how long you will need to present your objections; and  \n \n5.  Copies of any documents you or your lawyer will present at the Fairness Hearing. \n \nAt the hearing on the proposed settlement, the Court may schedule further hearings without further notice to the class.  The \nmatters considered at such future hearings may include, but shall not be limited to, further consideration of the fairness and \nadequacy of the proposed settlement, the determination of the settlement of individual claims filed by class members, \nconsideration of the request for attorneysโ fees and reimbursement of costs and expenses to class counsel, and the form and \nentry of the final judgment of dismissal in the event the proposed settlement is approved by the court. \n \nIndividually, or through counsel, any class member has the right to object to the proposed Settlement as a whole, to the amount \nof attorneysโ fees and costs of Class Counsel, or to any portion of either.  ALL SUCH OBJECTIONS MUST BE FILED IN \nWRITING ON OR BEFORE February 16, 2007, IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN \nDISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, 501 I STREET, COURTROOM 2, SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA 95814, ATTENTION: \nCLERK, RE: ROBINSON, ET AL.

For the reasons stated below, defendantsโ motion is\n9 DENIED in part and GRANTED in part.1\n10 BACKGROUND\n11 Plaintiffs Emily Robinson (โRobinsonโ), Heather J. Harrison\n12 (โHarrisonโ), and Ryan Price (โPriceโ) bring this action against\n13 all defendants, asserting violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth\n14 Amendments pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.2  (Pls.โ Second Amended\n15 Complaint (โCompl.โ), filed Sept. 17, 2004, at 2:15-18.)  In\n16 addition, plaintiffs assert claims under the Unruh Civil Rights\n17 Act (Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.1(b)) and California Penal Code ยง 4030.\n18 (Compl. at 2:19-26.) \n19 Each of the plaintiffs, at one point in time, has been held\n20 at Sacramento Countyโs B.T. Collins Juvenile Detention Center\n21 (โJuvenile Hallโ).  In or about June 2002, and again in October\n22 2002, Robinson was arrested for a misdemeanor offense and\n23 transported to the Juvenile Hall.  (Compl. at 5:17-22.)  Robinson\n24 alleges that prior to a detention hearing she was subjected to a\n25\n1 Because oral argument will not be of material\n26 assistance, the court orders the matter submitted on the briefs. \nSee E.D. Cal. L.R. 78-230(h).\n27\n2 Hereinafter all references to โSection 1983\" are to\n28 Title 42 of the United States Code.\n2\n\n1 visual body cavity search.  (Id.)  In or about June 2003,\n2 Harrison was arrested for a misdemeanor offense and transported\n3 to the Juvenile Hall. (Id. at 5:23-28.)  At the Juvenile Hall,\n4 Harrison claims to have been subjected to a visual body cavity\n5 search prior to a detention hearing.  (Id.)  On or about June 11,\n6 2004, Price was arrested for a misdemeanor offense and\n7 transported to the Juvenile Hall.  (Id. at 6:1-9.)  Price alleges\n8 that he was subjected to multiple visual body cavity searches\n9 prior to a detention hearing.  (Id.)  Price claims that four\n10 times during a five-day period, he โwas strip searched after\n11 returning to the unit from making a phone call or visiting his\n12 attorney.โ  (Id.)  These allegations form the basis of\n13 plaintiffsโ claims against each of the defendants.  \n14 At all relevant times, Speirs and Collins were the\n15 Sacramento County Chief Probation Officer and the Sacramento\n16 County Assistant Chief Probation Officer, respectively.  (Id. at\n17 3:27-4:9.)  Defendants claim they are immune from liability under\n18 the Eleventh Amendment on the ground that in Sacramento County,\n19 the Chief Probation Officer acts on behalf of the state rather\n20 than the county when administering the intake function at the\n21 Juvenile Hall.  (Defs.โ Mot. to Dismiss, filed October 15, 2004,\n22 at 5:6-14.)  Plaintiffs claim that Speirs is responsible for\n23 making, overseeing, and implementing the policies challenged in\n24 this case relating to the operation of the Juvenile Hall on\n25 behalf of Sacramento County. (Compl. at 3:27-4:3.)  Plaintiffs\n26 assert that Collins is responsible for assisting in the\n27 administration of these policies at the Juvenile Hall on behalf\n28 of Sacramento County.  (Id. at 4:4-9.)\n3\n\n1 STANDARD\n2 On a motion to dismiss, the allegations of the complaint\n3 must be accepted as true.  Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322\n4 (1972).  The court is bound to give plaintiff the benefit of\n5 every reasonable inference to be drawn from the โwell-pleadedโ\n6 allegations of the complaint.  Retail Clerks Int'l Ass'n v.\n7 Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746, 753 n.6 (1963).  Thus, the plaintiff\n8 need not necessarily plead a particular fact if that fact is a\n9 reasonable inference from facts properly alleged.  See id.  \n10 Given that the complaint is construed favorably to the\n11 pleader, the court may not dismiss the complaint for failure to\n12 state a claim unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff\n13 can prove no set of facts in support of the claim which would\n14 entitle him or her to relief.  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45\n15 (1957); NL Industries, Inc. v. Kaplan, 792 F.2d 896, 898 (9th\n16 Cir. 1986).\n17 Nevertheless, it is inappropriate to assume that plaintiff\n18 โcan prove facts which it has not alleged or that the defendants\n19 have violated the . . . laws in ways that have not been alleged.โ \n20 Associated Gen. Contractors of Calif., Inc. v. Calif. State\n21 Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526 (1983).  Moreover, the\n22 court โneed not assume the truth of legal conclusions cast in the\n23 form of factual allegations.โ  United States ex rel. Chunie v.\n24 Ringrose, 788 F.2d 638, 643 n.2 (9th Cir. 1986).\n25 In ruling upon a motion to dismiss, the court may consider\n26 only the complaint, any exhibits thereto, and matters which may\n27 be judicially noticed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201. \n28 See Mir v. Little Co. Of Mary Hospital, 844 F.2d 646, 649 (9th\n4\n\n1 Cir. 1988); Isuzu Motors Ltd. v. Consumers Union of United\n2 States, Inc., 12 F.Supp.2d 1035, 1042 (C.D. Cal. 1998).\n3 ANALYSIS\n4 I. Eleventh Amendment Immunity  \n5 The Eleventh Amendment provides: โThe judicial power of the\n6 United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law\n7 or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United\n8 States by citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects\n9 of any foreign state.โ  U.S. Const. amend. XI.  Thus, in the\n10 absence of any waiver of state immunity, states are immune from\n11 private damage actions brought in federal court.  Pennhurst State\n12 Sch. and Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984).  The\n13 Eleventh Amendment has been held applicable to suits brought\n14 against a state by its own citizens as well.  Id.  Moreover,\n15 because a suit against a state officer in his/her official\n16 capacity is no different from a suit against the state itself,\n17 state officers sued in their official capacity are also entitled\n18 to Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Will v. Michigan Dept. of State\n19 Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989).  However, a municipality or other\n20 local government entity may be sued under Section 1983 for\n21 constitutional torts committed by its officials according to an\n22 official policy, practice, or custom.  Monell v. N.Y. Dept. of\n23 Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690-691 (1978).\n24 Defendants seek dismissal of the claims brought against\n25 Speirs and Collins in their official capacity, arguing that they\n26 were acting in their capacity as state officials and are\n27 therefore entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Defendants\n28 also argue that because Speirs and Collins were acting in their\n5\n\n1 capacity as state officials rather than as a local policymaker\n2 for the County, no County policy exists to form the basis for\n3 municipal liability under Section 1983.  Thus, the threshold\n4 issue is in what capacity did Speirs and Collins act in\n5 conducting the subject โstripโ searches of plaintiffs. \n6 A. Speirs and Collins Are Not Immune From Section 1983\nLiability.  \n7\n8 Whether Speirs and Collins acted as county officials is\n9 governed by the analytical framework set out in McMillian v.\n10 Monroe County, Alabama, 520 U.S. 781 (1997).  In that case, the\n11 Supreme Court held that an Alabama sheriff could not be sued\n12 under Section 1983 for intimidating witnesses into making\n13 materially false statements and for suppressing exculpatory\n14 evidence because the sheriff was exercising state authority.  In\n15 reaching this result, the Supreme Court cautioned against a\n16 categorical approach.  Id. at 785.  Instead, the Court held,\n17 โ[T]o hold a local government liable for an officialโs conduct, a\n18 plaintiff must first establish that the official (1) had final\n19 policymaking authority โconcerning the action alleged to have\n20 caused the particular constitutional or statutory violation at\n21 issueโ and (2) was the policymaker for the local governing body\n22 for the purposes of the particular act.โ  Weiner v. San Diego\n23 County, 210 F.3d 1025, 1028 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting McMillian,\n24 520 U.S. at 785).  When determining a countyโs liability under\n25 McMillian, the Ninth Circuit has instructed that โwhile [courts]\n26 must conduct an independent examination of Californiaโs\n27 Constitution, codes, and caselaw with respect to each โparticular\n28 areaโ or each โparticular issue,โ [this] circuit[โs] caselaw\n6\n\n1 โprovides the starting point for our own analysis.โโ Cortez v.\n2 County of Los Angeles, 294 F.3d 1186, 1189 (9th Cir. 2002)\n3 (quoting Brewster v. Shasta County, 275 F.3d 803, 806 (9th Cir.\n4 2001)).    \n5 Under McMillian, the first question the court must address\n6 is whether Speirs and Collins had โfinal policymaking authorityโ\n7 concerning the enactment and administration of a strip search\n8 policy at the Juvenile Hall.  Here, neither party disputes that\n9 Speirs and Collins have final policymaking authority regarding\n10 the intake procedures at the Juvenile Hall.3  The court finds\n11 that the first prong of the McMillian test is satisfied.\n12 Therefore, the court turns to the second question posed by\n13 McMillian; namely, whether Speirs and Collins acted as a\n14 policymaker for the County or for the State for the purposes of\n15 the particular act in question (e.g., strip searching detainees\n16 as they are admitted to the Juvenile Hall).  \n17 The determination of whether a county official acts for the\n18 State or for the County is a question of federal law informed by\n19 how state law defines the officialโs functions.  McMillian, 520\n20 U.S. at 786.  The question the court must examine is not whether\n21 the official acts for the state or county in a categorical, โall\n22 or nothingโ manner, but rather whether he is a โfinal\n23 policymaker[] for the local government in a particular area, or\n24\n3 The parties do not raise an issue as to the โfinal\n25 policymaking authorityโ of Assistant Chief Probation Officer\nCollins.  Nevertheless, the court finds that because the\n26 California Code of Regulations permit an Assistant Chief\nProbation Officer to develop written policies and procedures\n27 regarding the intake procedures at juvenile detention centers,\nshe is also properly considered a โfinal policymaker.โ  See 15\n28 C.C.R. ยงยง 102, 1350, 1360 (2004).\n7\n\n1 on a particular issue.โ  Id. at 785.  In this case, the court\n2 must decide whether Speirs and Collins acted as policymakers for\n3 Sacramento County or for the State in creating and administering\n4 a strip search policy at the Juvenile Hall.\n5 McMillian instructs that the determination of whether a\n6 local officer is a state or a county actor depends entirely on an\n7 analysis of the particular function at issue.  McMillian, 520\n8 U.S. at 785.   The function at issue here is the strip searching\n9 of juveniles as they are admitted into the Juvenile Hall.4  This\n10 precise factual circumstance appears to be one of first\n11 impression.  However, the enactment and administration of intake\n12 and confinement policies (including strip searching inmates and\n13 subjecting inmates to visual body cavity searches) at a county\n14 jail were recently found to be administrative functions performed\n15 on behalf of the county, not the state.  (Order Granting in Part\n16 and Denying in Part Defs.โ Mot. to Dismiss, Chatoian v. County of\n17 Marin, Civ. 04-2790 MJJ, filed December 14, 2004, N.D. Cal., at\n18 10:21-22.)  The Chatoian courtโs reasoning is well-crafted and\n19 particularly relevant to this case.\n20 As in Chatoian, the court finds that the function at issue\n21 here involves jail administration, not law enforcement.  The\n22 policies at issue relate to the intake procedures and housing of\n23 minors at the Juvenile Hall.  Chatoain, Order at 6:27-28 (stating\n24 โ[S]uch policies are enacted and implemented not to prevent\n25\n26 4 Plaintiffs allege, and the court accepts as true for\ndeciding this motion, that the practice at the Juvenile Hall is\n27 to strip search those admitted into the facility.  The Court\nshall refer to this function as the โintake policyโ or the\n28 โintake proceduresโ at the Sacramento County Juvenile Hall.\n8\n\n1 crime, but to ensure safety and security within jail walls.โ) As\n2 such, these policies are enacted and implemented in furtherance\n3 of the administration of the Juvenile Hall, not to enforce the\n4 law.\n5 1. Under California Law, a County Probation Officer\nis a County Policymaker When Engaged in Juvenile\n6 Hall Administration.\n7 Having found that the conduct at issue is an administrative\n8 function, the Court must now, by reviewing state law, as dictated\n9 by McMillian, determine whether defendants performed this\n10 function on the Countyโs behalf or the Stateโs behalf.  This\n11 analysis is informed by evaluating the California Constitution,\n12 appropriate statutes and regulations, and relevant case law.    \n13 a. California Constitution\n14 As in McMillian, our analysis must begin with the California\n15 Constitution.  The McMillian Court relied heavily on two\n16 provisions of the Alabama Constitution.  First, and โespecially\n17 important for our purposes,โ is the provision in the Alabama\n18 Constitution designating a county sheriff as an executive\n19 officer.  McMillian, 520 U.S. at 787.  Under the California\n20 Constitution, probation officers are not designated as members of\n21 the executive branch.  Indeed, probation officers are not listed\n22 in the California Constitution.  Given the weight the McMillian\n23 court afforded to the listing of the sheriff as an executive\n24 officer, the lack of such a provision in the California\n25 Constitution pertaining to probation officers is important to the\n26 courtโs analysis. \n27 The McMillian Court also gave weight to the fact that the\n28 Alabama Supreme Court had authority to impeach a county sheriff\n9\n\n1 for neglect of office.  Id. at 788.  The impeachment of a sheriff\n2 by the Alabama Supreme Court signified to the Court that the\n3 office of sheriff shared โthe same impeachment procedures as\n4 state legal officers and lower state court judges, rather than\n5 county and municipal officers.โ  Id. at 788-789.  Defendants\n6 contend that Speirs and Collins must be state actors because the\n7 judge of the juvenile court has the power to remove them from\n8 office.  However, McMillian made clear that if local officials\n9 are to be considered โstate actorsโ for Eleventh Amendment\n10 purposes then the method of impeachment (i.e., removing the\n11 official from office) should be the same process that exists\n12 under state law for state legal officers and lower state court\n13 judges.  Id.  Moreover, the California Constitution does not list\n14 probation officers in Article IV, section 18, which provides for\n15 impeachment of a variety of state officers before the\n16 Legislature.  Instead, probation officers can be removed from\n17 office following the accusation of the county grand jury.  Cal.\n18 Govโt Code ยงยง 3060 et seq. (2004).  Therefore, unlike the Alabama\n19 Constitution, the California Constitution fails to establish any\n20 legislative intent that probation officers are to be considered\n21 officers of the state.       \n22 b. California Statutes and Regulations\n23 The court next turns to California statutory law.  A review\n24 of California statutory law points to the conclusion that a\n25 probation officer acts for the County when enacting and\n26 administering intake policy at the Juvenile Hall.  Under\n27 California law, monetary damages for Section 1983 claims are paid\n28 by the County, and not the State.  Cal. Govโt Code ยง 815.2\n10\n\n1 (2004).  This is a critical factor in finding that, in terms of\n2 the administration of intake procedure at the Juvenile Hall,\n3 Speirs and Collins are County actors.  The McMillian Court stated\n4 that it was โstrong evidence in favor of the  . . .  conclusion\n5 that sheriffs act on behalf of the Stateโ that a judgment against\n6 the sheriff would be a suit paid by the state, and that the\n7 county would not be liable for a sheriffโs acts.  McMillian, 520\n8 U.S. at 789.\n9 In addition, the following statutory provisions further\n10 suggest that a probation officer acts on behalf of the County\n11 when administering intake procedures at the Juvenile Hall: (1)\n12 Cal. Wel. & Inst. Code ยง 270 states that a probation officer is\n13 an officer of the county; (2) Cal. Wel. & Inst. Code ยง 850\n14 requires the board of supervisors of every county to provide and\n15 maintain a juvenile hall at the expense of the county; (3) Cal.\n16 Wel. & Inst. Code ยง 853 mandates that the board of supervisors\n17 provide for the management and expense of operating a juvenile\n18 hall; and (4) Cal. Wel. & Inst. Code ยงยง 272 and 278 allow for the\n19 board of supervisors to delegate certain responsibilities away\n20 from the probation officer.  These California statutes illustrate\n21 that, in terms of managing the juvenile hall (e.g., developing\n22 and administering intake policies and procedures), the County is\n23 primarily responsible for juvenile hall administration.\n24 Defendants cite to Cal. Wel. & Inst. Code ยงยง 209(a) and 210,\n25 in support of their argument that Speirs and Collins acted on\n26 behalf of the State, not as a County policymaker, when operating\n27\n28\n11\n\n1 the Juvenile Hall.  However, the specific responsibilities5\n2 granted to the State Board of Corrections and the judge of the\n3 juvenile court by the Legislature hardly can be said to convert a\n4 county juvenile hall into a state facility.  The court finds that\n5 the limited enforcement remedies found in the cited statutes\n6 suggest that state control over a juvenile hall is not so\n7 significant as to transform the administration of intake policy\n8 and procedures by a probation officer into state action.6\n9 The Court next turns to the California regulatory scheme\n10 regarding juvenile halls.  Defendants contend that Section 1360\n11 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations specifically\n12 establishes standards regarding strip searches at juvenile halls\n13 and, thus, a probation officer acts on behalf of the state when\n14 administering these policies.7  The Court finds, however, that\n15\n16 5 The State Board of Corrections is to adopt minimum\nstandards for facilities housing juveniles.  Cal. Wel. & Inst.\n17 Code ยง 210.  A judge is to inspect these facilities each year. \nCal. Wel. & Inst. Code ยง 209(a).  The judge is to notify the\n18 operator of any facility not in compliance with the Boardโs\nminimum standards.  Id.  In addition, the Board is to inspect\n19 each facility every two years and must also notify the operator\nof any facility not in compliance with its minimum standards. \n20 Id.  If the facility is thereafter found not to be โa suitable\nplace for the confinement of minors,โ the juvenile court or the\n21 Board is required to โgive notice of its findings to all persons\nhaving authority to confine minors....โ  Id.  Sixty days after\n22 such notification, โthe facility shall not be used for\nconfinement of minorsโ until โthe facility is a suitable\n23 place....โ  Id.\n24 6 See 83 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 111 (2000) (stating that\nthe State Board of Corrections does not possess the additional\n25 enforcement remedies of โfiling a legal action or imposing\nsanctions against public officials responsible for operating a\n26 particular juvenile facility in violation of section 209.โ) \n27 7 Section 1360 of Title 15 of the California Code of\nRegulations states, in pertinent part, โ[T]he facility\n28 (continued...)\n12\n\n1 the CCR section cited does not mandate that result.  Defendants\n2 fail to recognize that the standards governing strip searches\n3 enumerated in 15 C.C.R. ยง 1360 only create a base level that\n4 county juvenile facilities must not drop below.  Each county\n5 juvenile facility in California has the right to adopt its own\n6 standards and requirements so long as โsuch standards and\n7 requirements meet or exceed and do not conflict with these\n8 standards and requirements.โ  15 C.C.R. ยง 1301 (2004).  Even\n9 though probation officers are given minimum standards to follow\n10 by a state agency, it does not transform them into state actors\n11 when conducting and establishing intake procedure.  Cf. Beentjes\n12 v. Placer County Air Pollution Control Dist., 254 F. Supp. 2d\n13 1159, 1171 (E.D. Cal. 2003) (local air pollution control\n14 districts, which derive their authority from the State and are\n15 granted wide latitude to conduct their affairs as they see fit so\n16 long as they maintain standards at least as stringent as those\n17 adopted by the State, are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment\n18 immunity.)\n19 //           \n20\n21 7(...continued)\nadministrator shall develop written policies and procedures\n22 governing the search of minors, the facility, and visitors. \nSearches shall be conducted to ensure the safety and security of\n23 the facility, and to provide for the safety and security of the\npublic, visitors, minors, and staff.  Searches may be conducted\n24 as deemed necessary by the facility manager on a routine or\nrandom basis.  Searches shall not be conducted for harassment or\n25 as a form of discipline or punishment.  Body cavity searches, as\ndefined in Penal Code Section 4030, shall be conducted by medical\n26 personnel.โ  15 C.C.R. ยง 1360 (2004).  More specifically, the\nregulation instructs the facility administrator that these\n27 written procedures shall address โintake searches,โ โsearching\nminors who are returning from court,โ โfacility searches,โ and\n28 โlimited administrative searches of visitors.โ  Id.   \n13\n\n1 c. California Case Law\n2 Turning to the relevant case law, the parties do not cite to\n3 any California case which holds that the enactment and\n4 administration of intake policy by a probation officer at a\n5 juvenile hall is done on behalf of the county or the state, nor\n6 is the court, as stated above, aware of any such factually on-\n7 point authority.8  However, there is some direct authority that\n8 probation officers in California are considered county officials. \n9 See Nicholl v. Koster, 157 Cal. 416, 423 (1910) (stating that\n10 probation officers are โminor officers of the local county\n11 government.โ); Gibson v. Civil Service Commission of Los Angeles\n12 County, 27 Cal.App. 396, 399 (1915) (citing with approval the\n13 Nicholl holding that a probation officer is an officer of the\n14 county.)  Nonetheless, the labeling of the position as a county\n15 or state official does not end the inquiry.  \n16 The McMillian Court instructed, as discussed earlier, that\n17 the particular function at issue must be analyzed.  McMillian,\n18\n19 8 Defendants do cite to Venegas v. County of Los Angeles,\n32 Cal.4th 820 (2004) (holding that sheriffs are state actors in\n20 all matters related to crime investigation, officer training, and\nlaw enforcement policies), but defendants do not contend that\n21 Venegas should control our decision.  Given defendantsโ lack of\nemphasis on the Venegas decision, the courtโs discussion of this\n22 case will be brief.  First, the facts here do not involve a law\nenforcement function as in Venegas, but rather the administration\n23 of intake procedures at the Juvenile Hall.  Thus, the Venegas\ndecision is factually distinguishable from this case.  Second,\n24 the holding in Venegas is not binding on this court because\nโfederal law provides the rule of decision in section 1983\n25 actions.โ  Streit v. County of Los Angeles, 236 F.3d 552, 560\n(9th Cir. 2001) (citing Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519\n26 U.S. 425, 430 n.5, (1997) (finding that โthe question whether a\nparticular state agency has the same kind of independent status\n27 as a county...is a question of federal law...[b]ut that federal\nquestion can be answered only after considering the provisions of\n28 state law that define the agencyโs character.โ)).\n14\n\n1 520 U.S. at 785.  In light of the lack of state case law directly\n2 on-point, the Court turns to a Ninth Circuit case of substantial\n3 persuasive value.\n4 In Cortez v. County of Los Angeles, 294 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir.\n5 2002), at issue was whether the county sheriff acted as\n6 policymaker for the state or county when he established and\n7 implemented policies and procedures for the safekeeping of\n8 inmates in the county jail.9  The court found that policies\n9 regarding the housing of jail inmates were made by sheriffs โnot\n10 as law enforcement officials, but as administrators wielding\n11 control over persons entrusted to their custody.โ  Id. at 1191\n12 (citation omitted).  The court found that the sheriff in\n13 executing his administrative duties was acting for the county,\n14 not the state.  Id. at 1190-1191.  Similarly, in enacting and\n15 administering the intake policy and procedures at the Juvenile\n16 Hall, Speirs and Collins are wielding control over persons\n17 entrusted to their custody.  Like Cortez, this court has found\n18 that the function at issue here is administrative and, as such,\n19 following Cortez the court is compelled to find that defendants\n20 performed that function on behalf of the County and not the\n21 State.  \n22 Thus, for the reasons above, as supported by the California\n23 Constitution, relevant statutes, regulations and case law,\n24 Speirsโ and Collinsโ motion to dismiss plaintiffsโ claims brought\n25\n26 9 The policy at issue was the segregation of gang inmates\nat the jail, 294 F.3d at 1188, which is admittedly different than\n27 the search of minors when taken into custody in the case at bar. \nHowever, importantly both the policies concern the control over\n28 persons in custody.  \n15\n\n1 under Section 1983 is DENIED.\n2 B. The County of Sacramento and Sacramento County\nProbation Department Are Thereby Not Immune\n3\nCities, counties, and local officers sued in their official\n4\ncapacity are themselves โpersonsโ for purposes of Section 1983\n5\nand, although they cannot be held vicariously liable for unlawful\n6\nacts by subordinate officials, they may be held directly liable\n7\nfor constitutional violations carried out under their own\n8\nregulations, policies, customs, or usages by persons having\n9\nโfinal policymaking authorityโ over the actions at issue. \n10\nMonell, 436 U.S. at 690-692.  For purposes of deciding this\n11\nmotion, the court must accept as true plaintiffsโ allegation that\n12\nSpeirs and Collins maintained an official policy, custom, or\n13\npractice which caused violations of plaintiffsโ constitutional\n14\nrights.  Since Speirs and Collins were acting on behalf of\n15\nSacramento County in administering these intake procedures at the\n16\nJuvenile Hall, the County is subject to Section 1983 liability\n17\nunder Monell.  Thus, the Countyโs and the Probation Departmentโs\n18\nmotion to dismiss plaintiffsโ claims brought under Section 1983\n19\nis DENIED.  \n20\nII. State Law Claims\n21\nDefendants assert that plaintiffsโ state law claims must be\n22\ndismissed due to plaintiffsโ failure to comply with the claim\n23\npresentation requirements of the California Tort Claims Act.10 \n24\n(Defs.โ Mot. to Dismiss at 8:3-5.)  In opposition, plaintiffs\n25\nโacknowledge that [their] state law claims may not be maintained\n26\nbecause of the failure to file timely government tort claims\n27\n28 10 Cal. Govโt Code ยง 900 et seq.\n16\n\n1 required as a prerequisite to suit on the state law claims.โ \n2 (Pls.โ Opposition to Defs.โ Mot. to Dismiss, filed December 3,\n3 2004, at 12:1-3.)  Accordingly, defendantsโ motion to dismiss\n4 plaintiffsโ state law claims is GRANTED.\n5 CONCLUSION\n6 For the foregoing reasons, defendantsโ motion to dismiss is\n7 DENIED in part with respect to plaintiffsโ Section 1983 claims\n8 and GRANTED in part with respect to plaintiffsโ state law claims.\n9 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n10 DATED: February 4, 2005.\n11 /s/ Frank C.
