Govt Code Sec 946.6(f) and Solano County is immune under Cal. Govt Code Sec 844.6; (2) the Cal. Civ. Code Sec 52.1 claim for damages against Solano County Chief Probation Officer Gemma Grossi (\"Grossi\"), Solano County Juvenile Hall Superintendent Gladys Moore (\"Moore\"), and the unnamed dfts 1 through 10 because they are immune under Cal. Govt Code Sec 820.2; and (3) the class claim under Sec 52.1 because Cal. Civil Code Sed 52.1 (b) does not authorize representative actions. The court anticipates denying the motion to dismiss for the following state law claims: (1) the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief under Cal. Civ. Code Sec 52.1 against Grossi, Moore, and the unnamed dfts because the claimed immunities do not reach these forms of relief; and (2) the Cal. Penal Code Sec 4030 claim against Grossi, Moore, and unnamed dfts because that section evidences the legislature's intent to withdraw applicable immunities. The court will order the matter submitted on the briefs unless a party shows good cause for hearing oral argument on the motion.

Merin filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the  U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenging the Solano County and Solano County Probation Department policy of subjecting juveniles to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at Solano County Juvenile Detention Center.  Plaintiffs alleged that pursuant to the defendants' policies, juvenile detainees in their custody were subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches before such they appeared at a detention hearing and without having any reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.  The complaint asserted claims for violations of: 1) violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 2) violation of California's Bane Act, California Civil Code section 52.1(a) and Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code section 52.1(b), based on alleged use of coercion to deprive Plaintiffs of their rights under article I, section 1, of the California Constitution and California Penal Code section 4030; 3) violation of California Penal Code section 4030. Plaintiffs sought monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.</p><p>Defendants filed answers generally denying all allegations of wrong doing or liability.  They also moved to dismiss the state law claims.  The District Court (Judge David F. Levi)  granted the motion in part and dismissed the state law claims for damages and the class claim under Section 52.1.  The motion to dismiss the state law claims for declaratory and injunctive relief was denied.  Taggart ex rel. Perry v. Solano County, 2005 WL 3325752 (E.D.Cal. Dec 06, 2005)</p><p>Discovery followed and then defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings or summary adjudication on plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims asserting that the County was shielded by the Eleventh Amendment and that the individual defendants were protected by qualified immunity. Judge Levi denied the motion.  Taggart ex rel. Perry v. Solano County, 2006 WL 737017 (E.D.Cal. Mar 20, 2006).   </p><p>At the time of this summary, the case was still pending.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and all those similarly situated,\n4 seeks an order declaring illegal defendants’ policy of subjecting juvenile detainees to strip and visual\n5 body cavity searches before such detainees have appeared at a detention hearing and without having\n6 any reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of contraband.\n7 Defendants’ strip and visual body cavity search policies, practices, and customs violated and\n8 violate the rights of plaintiff, and each of those persons similarly situated, secured by the Fourth and\n9 Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and entitles plaintiff, and all of those similarly\n10 situated, to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983).  \n11 Additionally, plaintiff includes claims and a prayer for damages under California state law\n12 against individual defendants for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code §\n13 52.1(b)) pursuant to which she is, and each of those persons similarly situated are, entitled to recover\n14 a minimum of $4,000 for each violation of rights secured to them by the Constitution or laws of the\n15 state of California and the Constitution or laws of the United States, and for violation of California\n16 Penal Code section 4030’s prohibition of pre-detention hearing strip-searches, pursuant to which\n17 plaintiff is, and each of those persons similarly situated are entitled to recover minimum damages\n18 of $1,000 and attorneys’ fees.\n19 JURISDICTION\n20 1.

Defendant SOLANO COUNTY CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER GEMMA GROSSI\n6 is, and at all material times referred to herein, was responsible for administering SOLANO\n7 COUNTY’s juvenile detention facilities and for making, overseeing, enforcing, and implementing\n8 the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of SOLANO\n9 COUNTY’s Juvenile Detention Center.  Defendant GROSSI’s role in making, promulgating,\n10 overseeing, enforcing, and implementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein are\n11 a direct and proximate cause of the damages claimed by plaintiffs.

She is sued in her individual and official capacities.\n21 7. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that defendants sued herein by\n22 their fictitious names (DOES 1 through 150) are SOLANO COUNTY Probation Officers and/or\n23 other persons employed by the defendant SOLANO COUNTY who, as part of their duties at the\n24 SOLANO COUNTY Juvenile Detention Center, subjected plaintiff, and all those similarly situated,\n25 to pre-detention hearing strip and/or visual body cavity searches without first having a reasonable\n26 suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff is not currently\n27 aware of the true names and identities of those sued herein as DOES 1 through 150, but will amend\n28 this complaint to include such persons’ real names once said names are made available.\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nJASMINE TAGGART, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al. USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________________\n- 3 -\n\n1 8. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n2 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages\n3 of the State of California, SOLANO COUNTY, and/or the Solano County Probation Department.\n4 9. Defendant SOLANO COUNTY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was,\n5 a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official policy, custom, or\n6 practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which\n7 wrongs damaged plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.  Plaintiff’s allegations\n8 against the COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER, the\n9 JUVENILE HALL SUPERINTENDENT, and their officers, and on acts and omissions of persons\n10 who are COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’s breach of its duty to protect plaintiff, and all\n11 those similarly situated,  from the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees. \n12 10. Defendants  SOLANO  COUNTY  CHIEF  PROBATION  OFFICER  GEMMA\n13 GROSSI, in her individual and official capacity, and SOLANO COUNTY JUVENILE HALL\n14 SUPERINTENDENT GLADYS MOORE, in her individual and official capacity, also created,\n15 maintained, enforced, and/or permitted an official policy or custom or practice causing the\n16 occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiff, and all\n17 those similarly situated, as herein alleged.\n18 11. Class action plaintiffs  are those similarly situated juveniles who have not yet reached\n19 adulthood or who have turned 18 within two years of the filing of this complaint and who were\n20 subjected by defendants to pre-detention hearing strip and/or visual body cavity searches without\n21 defendants having a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or\n22 weapons.\n23 FACTS\n24 12. On or about October 27, 2003, plaintiff JASMINE TAGGART, a minor, was picked\n25 up as a runaway and transported to the SOLANO COUNTY Juvenile Hall and there, prior to a\n26 detention hearing, pursuant to defendants’ blanket policy and practice, was subjected to visual body\n27 cavity searches in violation of California Penal Code § 4030, the state constitution’s guarantee of\n28 the right of privacy, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nJASMINE TAGGART, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al. USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________________\n- 4 -\n\n1 the Bane Act (California Civil Code § 52.1).\n2 13. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants had no\n3 reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search of plaintiff would result in the discovery\n4 of contraband or weapons.\n5 14. On or about September 17, 2004, plaintiff file a government Tort Claim with\n6 SOLANO COUNTY, on behalf of herself and the class she seeks to represent, describing her claim\n7 arising out of being strip searched at the SOLANO COUNTY Juvenile Hall.  A copy of her claim\n8 is attached hereto as Exhibit “1”.  The claim was denied as a late claim on October 19, 2004.  On\n9 February 23, 2005, the Solano County Superior Court issued a tentative ruling that “[t]he petition\n10 for relief from the claims filing requirements is granted as to Petitioner JASMINE TAGGART and\n11 as to those persons in the proposed class whose alleged injuries arose on or after the date Petitioner’s\n12 claim arose (October 27, 2003), but excluding any person who was not a minor during the entire time\n13 that their claim could have been timely presented.”  Unopposed, that tentative ruling became the\n14 final ruling of the Solano County Superior Court on plaintiff’s petition for relief from the\n15 government claim filing requirements. \n16 15. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants routinely\n17 follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-detention hearing juvenile detainees,\n18 including plaintiff, to strip and visual body cavity searches, without having a reasonable suspicion\n19 that the searches will be productive of contraband or weapons.\n20 16. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants have the ability\n21 to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who are still juveniles or who were\n22 juveniles within two years of the filing of this complaint and who, while in defendants’ custody at\n23 the SOLANO COUNTY Juvenile Detention Facility, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual\n24 body cavity searches prior to appearing at a detention hearing without defendants first having a\n25 reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons and/or after\n26 having been strip searched without reasonable suspicion were thereafter strip searched repeatedly\n27 without there being an opportunity to acquire contraband or weapons which might be discovered\n28 during further strip searches.\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nJASMINE TAGGART, et al. v.

Defendants GROSSI and MOORE and defendants DOES 1 through 10 are jointly and\n2 severally personally responsible for the promulgation, enforcement, and continuation of the strip\n3 search policies, practices, and customs pursuant to which plaintiff herein, and the persons in the class\n4 plaintiff purports to represent, were subjected to pre-detention hearing strip searches, and by which\n5 plaintiff and the class plaintiff purports to represent were harmed.\n6 18. Defendants DOES 11 through 150 are personally responsible for strip searching\n7 plaintiff, and others similarly situated, prior to a detention hearing without reasonable suspicion that\n8 a strip search would be productive of contraband or weapons in violation of state and federal\n9 statutory and constitutional law; and/or, strip searching plaintiff, and those she seeks to represent,\n10 repeatedly without there being an opportunity to acquire contraband or weapons after a strip search\n11 based on reasonable suspicion.\n12 19. As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, plaintiff and all\n13 those similarly situated have suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy,\n14 and violation of due process of law and federal and state statutory and constitutional rights, and are\n15 entitled to recover damages according to proof, including exemplary damages.\n16 CLASS CLAIMS\n17 20. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiff, and each of those\n18 similarly situated, was subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of\n19 defendants, and each of them.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard\n20 to the nature of the alleged offense for which plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, had been\n21 arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, was eligible\n22 for release under Welfare & Institutions Code §§ 628 et seq.  Furthermore, the searches complained\n23 of herein were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that plaintiff, or those\n24 similarly situated, possessed weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a\n25 reasonable belief that the searches would produce contraband. \n26 21. Plaintiff brings this action on her own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n27 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n28 \\\\\\\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nJASMINE TAGGART, et al. v.

The class is defined to include all persons who are currently juveniles or who reached\n2 the age of majority within two years of filing of this complaint, and who were arrested and subjected\n3 to a pre-detention hearing strip and/or visual body cavity search at SOLANO COUNTY’s Juvenile\n4 Detention Facility without defendants having a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be\n5 productive of contraband or weapons.\n6 23. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n7 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiff does not know the exact\n8 number of class members.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are\n9 more than 25 persons per day who are detained by defendants and/or in the custody of defendants\n10 and subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and\n11 custom relating to said searches.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that there\n12 are thousands of persons in the proposed class.\n13 24. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is informed\n14 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact common to the class\n15 including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all juveniles arrested to visual\n16 body cavity searches prior to appearance at a detention hearing; (2) whether persons are subjected\n17 to visual body cavity searches prior to detention hearings without there being any reasonable\n18 suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed\n19 drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in body cavities which could be detected by means of a visual\n20 body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy\n21 so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches, or whether the\n22 visual body cavity searches are conducted in open areas and/or areas monitored by video surveillance\n23 equipment so that those being searched may be observed by persons not participating in the searches;\n24 (4) whether strip searches are performed repeatedly, such that following one strip search, a juvenile\n25 is strip-searched again even though there was no opportunity for the juvenile searched to acquire\n26 contraband or weapons; and, (5) whether the visual body cavity searches are reasonably related to\n27 defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the juvenile detention facility and\n28 whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nJASMINE TAGGART, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al. USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________________\n- 7 -\n\n1 25. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is informed\n2 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law common to the class\n3 including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity searches\n4 on juveniles prior to their detention hearings without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or\n5 articulable facts, to believe any particular detainee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband\n6 which would likely be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants may\n7 perform visual body cavity searches on juveniles without first reasonably relating the use of the\n8 visual body cavity search to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the juvenile\n9 detention facility and determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that interest; (3)\n10 whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the search can be observed\n11 by people not participating in the search without violating plaintiff’s Federal and State constitutional\n12 rights; (4) whether defendants may perform repetitious strip searches without the juvenile searched\n13 having had an opportunity to acquire contraband or weapons; and, (5) whether or not defendants’\n14 strip search policy, custom, and procedure is in accordance with the laws of the State of California\n15 and the State and Federal Constitutions.\n16 26. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n17 representative plaintiff is typical of the class.  Plaintiff was subjected to strip and visual body cavity\n18 searches, prior to her detention hearings, without reasonable suspicion that strip or visual body cavity\n19 searches would produce drugs, weapons or contraband.  Representative plaintiff has the same\n20 interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiff’s claims arose\n21 because of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body\n22 cavity searches prior to detention hearings without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable\n23 suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff’s claims are based\n24 upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each class member suffered actual\n25 damages as a result of being subjected to a strip or visual body cavity search.  The actual damages\n26 suffered by the representative plaintiff is similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered\n27 by each class member, in that each member of the class is entitled to minimum damages of $1,000\n28 under Penal Code Section 4030(p) and $4,000 under Civil Code Section 52(a).\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nJASMINE TAGGART, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al. USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________________\n- 8 -\n\n1 27. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n2 plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  The representative plaintiff’s interests\n3 are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n4 28. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions\n5 of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or\n6 varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible\n7 standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.  \n8 29. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions\n9 of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent\n10 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter,\n11 substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their\n12 interests.\n13 30. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiff is\n14 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n15 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n16 respect to the class as a whole.  \n17 31. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action\n18 is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy\n19 between the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the interests of\n20 members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that\n21 most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiff is informed\n22 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that\n23 separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that\n24 most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiff is informed\n25 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum\n26 because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., SOLANO COUNTY.  It will promote\n27 judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in\n28 multiple courts.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nJASMINE TAGGART, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al. USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________________\n- 9 -\n\n1 32. Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff is\n2 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the identities of the class members may be\n3 ascertained from records maintained by defendant SOLANO COUNTY, its Probation Department,\n4 and defendants GROSSI and MOORE.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges,\n5 that defendants’ records reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the\n6 persons who have been held in custody in the SOLANO COUNTY Juvenile Detention Facility.\n7 Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records  maintained by defendants\n8 reflect who was subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search occurred,\n9 where the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed, when persons\n10 searched appeared at detention hearings, and the charges on which such persons were arrested.\n11 Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that all of the foregoing information is\n12 contained in defendants’ computer system and that the information necessary to identify the class\n13 members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from\n14 custody, is readily available from said computer system.  \n15 33. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(2)(B), class members\n16 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual\n17 notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiff is informed and\n18 believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants’ computer records contain a last known address for\n19 class members.  Plaintiff contemplates that individual notice will be given to class members at such\n20 last known address by first class mail.  Plaintiff contemplates that the notice will inform class\n21 members of the following:\n22 i. The nature of the action;\n23 ii. The definition of the class certified;\n24 iii. The class claims and issues;\n25 iv. That a class member may enter an appearance through counsel if the member\n26 so desires;\n27 v. That the court will exclude from the class any member who requests\n28 exclusion, stating when and how members may elect to be excluded; and,\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nJASMINE TAGGART, et al. v.
