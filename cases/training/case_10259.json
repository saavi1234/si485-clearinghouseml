The Court held: (1) Defendants' strip search policy violated the Fourth Amendment because it did not require individualized suspicion that detainees were concealing contraband, and (2) strip search of Plaintiff violated the Fourth Amendment.</p><p>Kidd v.

Thomas Stinglen, and Officer Kevin Walsh,\nindividually and in their capacities as Police Officers for the Town of Durham; Robert\nLeClair, Superintendent, Strafford County House of Correction, in his official capacity;\nSgt. Warren F. Dowaliby, Correctional Officer Ann Gagne, Sgt. Frederic Fogarty,\nindividually and in their capacities as Correctional Officers for the County of Strafford;\nCounty of Strafford, New Hampshire.\nCivil No. 90-482-SD.\nUnited States District Court, D. New Hampshire.\nAugust 24, 1993.\nJames P. Loring, Portsmouth, NH, for plaintiff.\nTheodore Wadleigh, Manchester, NH, for defendants County, Fogarty, Gagne, Dowaliby, LeClair.\nJames G. Walker, Manchester, NH, for defendants Gowen, Morganella, Stinglen.\nORDER\nDEVINE, Senior District Judge.\n[1]\nPlaintiff Barbra Burg Kidd brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983  and New Hampshire law alleging,\ninter alia, that a strip search of plaintiff conducted pursuant to Strafford County House of Correction (SCHC)\n17 policy[2] violated the Fourth Amendment.[3] The court's jurisdiction over plaintiff's *17 federal claims is proper\nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 (Supp.1993).\nPresently before the court is plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment against defendant Strafford County\nand defendants' objection thereto.\n1. Background\nOn October 22, 1988, Barbra Burg Kidd was taken into protective custody pursuant to New Hampshire Revised\n[4]\nStatutes Annotated (RSA) 172-B, based on a determination that she was intoxicated,  and she was delivered to\nSCHC. Upon her arrival, Kidd was taken by Correctional Officer Anne Gagne to a jail cell identified as cell no.\nH-5, which is located in a holding area.\nThe search of Kidd consisted of her removing all of her clothes, lifting her arms to expose her armpits, exposing\nthe soles of her feet and the palms of her hands, and shaking out her hair. Kidd was not required to bend or squat\nto expose her body cavities to any visual search. No manual body cavity search was conducted. Other than being\nassisted in the removal of a barrette, Kidd was not touched during the search.\nDefendants concede that the officers searching plaintiff \"had no specific suspicion that she may [have been]\ncarrying a weapon or other contraband. The officers conducting the search did so because the search was\nrequired by the rules and regulations of the institution and was authorized under the New Hampshire Statutes.\"\nDefendants' Objection Memo at 4.\n\n2. Discussion\na. Summary Judgment Standard\nSummary judgment \"shall be rendered if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), Fed. R.Civ.P.\nb. Liability of Strafford County under § 1983\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"a governmental entity is liable under § 1983 only when the entity itself is a\n`moving force' behind the deprivation.\" Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3105, 87\nL.Ed.2d 114 (1985) (quoting Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 326, 102 S.Ct. 445, 454, 70 L.Ed.2d 509\n(1981)). \"[T]he entity's `policy or custom' must have played a part in the violation of federal law.\" Id. (quoting \nMonell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)\n). It is undisputed that the strip search at issue was conducted pursuant to Strafford County policy.\nc. The Reasonableness Standard\nThe essential purpose of the proscriptions in the Fourth Amendment is to impose a standard of\n`reasonableness' upon the exercise of discretion by government officials, including law\nenforcement agents, in order `\"to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against\narbitrary invasions....\"' Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U.S. 307, 312 [98 S.Ct. 1816, 1820, 56\nL.Ed.2d 305] (1978), quoting Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 528 [87 S.Ct. 1727, 1731,\n18 L.Ed.2d 930] (1967). Thus, the permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged\nby balancing its intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of\nlegitimate governmental interests. Implemented in this manner, the reasonableness standard\n18 usually requires, at a minimum, that the facts upon which*18an intrusion is based be capable of\nmeasurement against `an objective standard,' whether this be probable cause or a less stringent\n[5]\ntest.\nDelaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653-54, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1395-96, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979) (footnotes omitted)\n(emphasis added).\nSimilarly, in determining the reasonableness of a strip search conducted at a correctional facility, the Supreme\nCourt has stated,\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1885, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nAlthough the First Circuit has not addressed the reasonableness of a strip search policy directed at persons\ndetained for being intoxicated, it has \"recognize[d] that `a strip search, by its very nature, constitutes an extreme\nintrusion upon personal privacy, as well as an offense to the dignity of the individual.'\" Cochrane v. Quattrocchi,\n949 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 235 n. 6 (1st Cir.1990),cert. denied, ___\nU.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992)). Accordingly, the First Circuit, echoing the \"objective\nstandard\" requirement stated in Delaware v. Prouse, supra, 440 U.S. at 654, 99 S.Ct. at 1396, has held \"that\nsome as-yet undefined `level of individualized suspicion' is necessary before a strip search of a prison visitor can\n\nbe reconciled with the requirements of the fourth amendment.\" Cochrane, supra, 949 F.2d at 13 (quoting \nBlackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 567 (1st Cir.1985)) (emphasis added by Cochrane court).\nDefendants offer two government interests as justification for the SCHC policy of strip searching all protective\ncustody detainees: (1) \"[t]he need for security in the Strafford County House of Correction,\" and (2) the need to\nprotect the safety of protective custody detainees themselves by preventing such individuals from possessing\n\"any object which might be used by the person\" to injure himself or herself. Defendant's Objection Memo at 6.\nThe interest of maintaining prison security was equally at issue in Cochrane, supra, 949 F.2d at 13 (\"`in deciding\nto what standard of reasonableness prison officials strip searching visitors should be held, we must balance the\nofficial interest in maintaining security against the intrusion entailed by a strip search'\" (quoting Blackburn, supra,\n771 F.2d at 564)), where, as noted above, the First Circuit held that the Fourth Amendment required the strip\nsearch in question to be conducted on the basis of at least \"some as-yet undefined `level of individualized\nsuspicion.'\" Id. (emphasis added). The court notes that defendants have failed to present the court with any\nevidence showing that intoxicated protective custody detainees are more likely to secrete weapons or other\ncontraband than prison visitors. Accordingly, the court finds that Cochrane is controlling with respect to SCHC's\ninterest in maintaining prison security.\nWith regard to SCHC's interest in protecting intoxicated protective custody detainees from possessing objects of\npotential harm to themselves, the court notes that defendants have failed to present any evidence showing that\n(1) intoxicated protective custody detainees are more likely to secrete weapons or other contraband than prison\nvisitors, and (2) that the threat of self harm by such detainees is greater than the threat of harm to prisoners from\nweapons or other contraband secreted by prison visitors. Accordingly, the court finds that Cochrane is also\ncontrolling as to SCHC's interest in protecting such detainees from self harm.\n19 *19 In light of the foregoing, the court finds that under the First Circuit's calibration of the Fourth Amendment\nreasonableness test in Cochrane, supra, SCHC's policy of strip searching intoxicated protective custody\ndetainees violates the Fourth Amendment insofar as it permits such searches without any individualized\nsuspicion that a particular detainee may be secreting weapons or other contraband. See also Stewart v. Lubbock\nCounty, 767 F.2d 153, 154-57 (5th Cir.1985) (policy permitting strip search of person arrested for public\nintoxication without reasonable suspicion that arrestee possessed weapons or contraband held unconstitutional\nunder Bell v. Wolfish, supra), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1066, 106 S.Ct. 1378, 89 L.Ed.2d 604 (1986); Logan v.\nShealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1009-10, 1013 (4th Cir.1981) (policy permitting strip search of person arrested for driving\nwhile intoxicated where \"there was no cause in her specific case to believe that she might possess either\n[weapons or other contraband]\" held unconstitutional under Bell v. Wolfish), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct.\n1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982). Further, bearing in mind that plaintiff was strip searched without any individualized\nsuspicion that she may have been secreting contraband, the court finds that under Cochrane the strip search of\nplaintiff also violated the Fourth Amendment. See also Stewart, supra; Logan, supra.\nAccordingly, and recognizing that no genuine issues of material fact remain as to the liability of defendant\nStrafford County, the court finds as a matter of law that plaintiff is entitled to partial summary judgment against\nsaid defendant.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons stated herein, the court grants plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment as to plaintiff's\nsection 1983 claim against defendant Strafford County.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] In relevant part, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects,\nor causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or\n\nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\n[2] Strafford County Department of Corrections Directive No. C-103(C)(1) provides that \"[t]he Intake Officer will\nconduct a complete Strip Search of prisoners being received before leaving the Intake Area to ensure that the\nprisoner does not have contraband in his/her possession when entering the facility.\" A \"Strip Search\" is defined as\n\"[a] search of an inmate which requires that all clothing is removed during the search.\" Directive No. D-220.\n[3] The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by\noath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\nU.S. Const., Art. IV.\n[4] RSA 172-B:3 I provides, \nWhen a peace officer encounters a person who, in the judgment of the officer, is intoxicated as defined in RSA\n172-B:1, X, the officer may take such person into protective custody and shall take whichever of the following\nactions is, in the judgment of the officer, the most appropriate to ensure the safety and welfare of the public, the\nindividual, or both:\n....\n(c) Lodge the person in a local jail or county correctional facility for said person's protection for up to 24 hours or\nuntil the keeper of said jail or facility judges the person to be no longer intoxicated.\n[5] The Supreme Court has held that application of an objective standard is not required where the government's\ninterest is indisputable and the degree of intrusion is minimal. See Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496\nU.S. 444, 110 S.Ct. 2481, 110 L.Ed.2d 412 (1990) (sobriety checkpoint program held constitutional).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
