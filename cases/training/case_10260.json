    "summary": "<p>On November 17, 1998, plaintiff filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 including state law claims against Strafford County, two Strafford County officials, Transcor America, Inc. (a transportation company), two Transcor employees, and Henry County, Tennessee officials in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.  Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, alleged her constitutional rights were violated when she was strip-searched.</p><p>Plaintiff was arrested in Tennessee on a New Hampshire warrant on December 22, 1995.  Plaintiff was jailed in Tennessee from December 22 until December 31, 1995.  On December 28, plaintiff signed a waiver of extradition.  Defendant Transcor employees conducted a body cavity strip-search of plaintiff according to Transcor's policy to strip-search all prisoners, and not due to individualized suspicion.  Transcor then transported plaintiff to the Strafford County House of Corrections.  During intake, plaintiff was required to undress, shower, and receive a decontamination spray.  The intake form said she was strip-searched.  Plaintiff was in the jail from January 7, 1996 until February 3, 1996, and from August 26, 1996 until September 8, 1996.  Plaintiff was strip-searched after each court appearance and contact with visitors pursuant to county policy</p><p>On August 27, 1999, the United States District Court (Judge Joseph A. Diclerico, Jr.) dismissed plaintiff's Complaint against Henry County, Tennessee Defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p><p>On October 13, 2000, Transcor defendants moved for summary judgment.</p><p>On November 6, 2000, Strafford County defendants moved for summary judgment.</p><p>On January 25, 2001, the United States District Court (Judge Joseph A. Diclerico, Jr.) granted partial summary judgment to Transcor defendants.  The Court dismissed counts as to Transcor defendants relating to other defendants.  The Court dismissed plaintiff's claim that Transcor denied her request to contact an attorney and denied her speedy access to the New Hampshire Courts because plaintiff stated in her deposition that she did not ask Transcor for a lawyer.  The Court denied summary judgment for claims under § 1983 and New Hampshire law because it found: (1) defendant did not show defendant was entitled to qualified immunity because qualified immunity is not necessarily available to private individuals who provide governmental services, and (2) a factual issue remained as to whether the Transcor defendants had reasonable suspicion to justify the strip search.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that plaintiff concealed contraband and plaintiff was charged with a crime not involving weapons or contraband and she was strip-searched after she spent a week in jail.</p><p>Elliott v. Strafford County, Case: 98-637-JD, 2001 WL 274767 (D.N.H. Jan. 25, 2001).</p><p>On February 7, 2001, the District Court (Judge Diclerico) granted partial summary judgment to defendants Strafford County, Strafford County Sheriff, and Superintendent of the Strafford House of Corrections.  The Court denied summary judgment as to plaintiff's claim relating to her strip-search during intake.  The Court found that defendants did not have reasonable suspicion that plaintiff concealed contraband because she was not charged with a crime involving contraband and because she had been in custody for more than two weeks.  The Court granted summary judgment to the Strafford defendants on plaintiff's claims arising from her strip-searches after contact visits and court appearances.  The Court found these strip-searches constitutional because of the possibility of smuggling contraband into prison.  The Court granted the Strafford defendants summary judgment on allegations against Transcor and relating to the Tennessee defendants.  Elliott v. Strafford County, Case: 98-637-JD, 2001 WL 274827 (D.N.H. Feb. 7, 2001)</p><p>On April 26, 2001, the parties agreed to private mediation.  </p><p>On June 29, 2001, the parties agreed to dismissal as to the Strafford County defendants.</p><p>On July 23, 2001, the parties agreed to dismissal as to the Transcor defendants.</p><p></p>",

Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n. 3 (1st Cir.1985) (defining “strip search” and “visual body cavity search”). \n \n \n2  Although Elliott also alleges that the strip searches violated her due process rights, she is essentially claiming that the strip searches \nwere unreasonable, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. See Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 \n \nU.S. 520, 560–61 (1979) Magill v. Lee County, 990 F.Supp. 1382, 1386 (M.D.Ala.1998). \n \n3  The parties do not question the basis of Transcor’s liability under § 1983 for the search conducted by its employee, Vogel. See, \ne.g., Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 334 (1986); Monell v. v.. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978). \n \n \n4  Elliott is therefore deemed not to make a claim against the Transcor defendants based on alleged violations of her right to bail. \n \n \n5  Elliott does not explain what federal constitutional or statutory right to privacy, other than the Fourth Amendment right alleged in \nCount I, she might have intended to claim. Instead, it appears that Elliott alleges only a state law privacy claim. Elliott cites \n \nSutherland v. Kroger Co., 110 S.E.2d 716 (W.Va.1959) in support of her claim. Since Sutherland was premised on West Virginia \nlaw of trespass, it appears that Elliott intends to allege a similar claim under New Hampshire law, despite the lack of citation to \nrelevant legal authority. It is not necessary, however, to resolve the legal basis of her claim for purposes of the present motion for \nsummary judgment. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  4 \n ",

Since summary judgment has not \n\t\r  \nbeen granted on all federal claims because a trialworthy \nissue remains as to part of Elliott’s § 1983 claim in Count \n Footnotes \n \n1  See Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n. 3 (1st Cir.1985) (defining “strip search” and “visual body cavity search”). \n \n \n2  Although Elliott also alleges that the strip searches violated her due process rights, she is essentially claiming that the strip searches \nwere unreasonable, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. See Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 \n \nU.S. 520, 560–61 (1979); Magill v. Lee County, 990 F.Supp. 1382, 1386 (M.D.Ala.1998). \n \n3  The Strafford defendants do not challenge the basis of Elliott’s § 1983 claims against them for strip searches conducted by other \nemployees of Strafford County. Apparently, therefore, the Strafford defendants concede that Elliott has sufficiently alleged claims \n \nagainst them under theories of supervisory or municipal liability. See, e.g., Miller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8, 12–13 (1st \nCir.2000); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 10–12 (1st Cir.1997); Allen v. Bd. of Comm’rs of County of Wyandot, 773 F.Supp. 1442, \n1451 (D.Kan.1991). \n \n4  In addition, even if such claims had been made, the court previously determined that Elliott had not presented a sufficient record to \navoid summary judgment on her claim that Transcor violated her Sixth Amendment rights. See Order issued January 25, 2001, at \n \n10–12. \n \n5  Elliott does not explain what federal constitutional or statutory right to privacy, other than the Fourth Amendment right alleged in \nCount I, she might have intended to claim. Elliott cites Sutherland v. Kroger Co., 110 S.E.2d 716 (W.Va.1959) in support of her \n \nclaim, which was premised on West Virginia law of trespass. Elliott may intend to make a similar claim under New Hampshire \nlaw, despite the lack of citation to relevant legal authority. Her lack of developed argumentation on the issue, however, prevents a \nseparate analysis under state law. See, e.g., United States v. Torres–Rosa, 209 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir.2000). \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n  5 \n \n\nElliott v. Strafford County, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2001)   \n \n \n  \n  6 \n ",
