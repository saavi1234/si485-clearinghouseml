    "summary": "<p>On January 9, 2003, four persons represented by attorneys from several law firms in Louisville, Kentucky, filed this class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The plaintiffs challenged the strip search policy of the Hopkins County, Kentucky, jail.  The plaintiffs alleged that they were searched pursuant to a blanket strip search policy of the jail which required all pretrial detainees transferred from other facilities to be strip searched, without regard to the individual circumstances surrounding the transfer or other factors indicating a reasonable suspicion to believe the transferee was concealing weapons or contraband.  The plaintiffs maintained that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and sought monetary damages, injunctive relief and class certification.</p><p>On March 18, 2005, the District Court certified the case as a class action involving two classes, pursuant to an agreed order of the parties defining the classes as: (1) an \"admission class\" consisting \"of all individuals arrested for minor offenses who were required to remove their clothing for a visual inspection on admission to the jail despite the absence of any reasonable suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband;\" (2) \"release class\" consisting of \"all persons who were required by defendants in the jail, just after becoming entitled to release, to remove all of their clothing for a visual inspection despite the absence of any reasonable grounds for doing so.\"   To determine the scope of the classes, some 7,000 questionnaires were mailed to potential members.</p><p>The plaintiffs also filed an Amended Complaint on March 18, 2005.  A Second Amended Complaint was filed on June 8, 2005 and a Third Amended Complaint on March 9, 2006.  The defendants moved to dismiss the case on numerous grounds, including asserting a statute of limitations bar, lack of standing, failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and failure to meet the physical injury requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\").  The District Court (District Judge Joseph H. McKinley, Jr.) denied the motion in all respects.  Sutton v. Hopkins County, Ky., 2005 WL 3478152 (W.D. Ky. Dec 19, 2005). The defendants then requested that the Court establish a deadline for the return of inmate questionnaires.  The District Court (Magistrate Judge E. Robert Goebel) denied the request.  Sutton v. Hopkins County, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11243 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 16, 2006).  See also Sutton v. Hopkins County, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3152 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, 2007) (Judge McKinley overruled defendants' objection to Magistrate Goebel's order).</p><p>Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of the constitutionality of the jail policy of strip searching pretrial detainees who were transferred from other facilities, which remained in effect until May 25, 2006.  The plaintiffs also moved for a preliminary injunction.  The defendants, in turn, moved to decertify the class.  Judge McKinley denied the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and for a preliminary injunction and granted defendants' motion for partial summary judgment, concluding that Hopkins County Jail's policy of strip searching pretrial detainees who were transferred from other facilities was reasonable and justified.  Sutton v. Hopkins County, Ky., 2007 WL 119856 (W.D. Ky. Jan 11, 2007).  The defendants' request for class decertification was denied.   Sutton v. Hopkins County, Ky., 2007 WL 119892 (W.D.Ky. Jan 11, 2007). </p><p>On July 17, 2008, the parties submitted a settlement agreement to the Court for approval.  On July 18, 2008, the court (Magistrate Judge E. Robert Goebel) granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement.  On October 20, 2008, the court (Judge Joseph H. McKinley) granted final approval of the settlement agreement. The settlement was for $3 million, with the named class members getting a larger amount.  Each class member would apply for compensation according to the procedure established in the settlement agreement. The settlement set forth procedures for claimants to appeal decisions from the claims administrator to the court.  For example, on August 20, 2009, the court reversed and remanded a decision by the claims administrator denying relief to a plaintiff who had been strip-searched. 2009 WL 2589506 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 20, 2009).</p><p>One of the potential class members had challenged the approval of the settlement agreement and filed for a declaration of rights, to intervene and to hold in abeyance. The class member also filed a motion for equitable relief, for relief pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), or, in the alternative, to reopen the case. On October 9, 2009, the court permitted the class member to submit a claim form to the claims administrator in accordance procedures set forth in the settlement. However, the Court declined to decide whether she qualifies as a member of the class at this time. Instead, the parties would adhere to the claims approval and appeal process set forth in the settlement. 2009 WL 3294843 (W.D. Ky. Oct. 13, 2009).</p><p>Also on October 9, 2009, the court allowed another potential class member who had been left out of the proceedings to submit a late claim form. 2009 WL 3299597 (W.D. Ky. Oct. 13, 2009).</p><p>On January 25, 2010, the court issued final judgment and dismissed this class action and all claims against defendants and their insurers with prejudice. All class members who did not make a timely request to be excluded from the class were barred and enjoined from commencing and/or prosecuting any claim or action against the defendants relating to the claims alleged in this case.</p><p>In 2013, a prisoner who had been deposed by the defendants but did not receive his claim filed a motion for relief. On March 4, 2013, the court denied his motion for relief.  No other motions have been filed in the case since then. </p>",

INTRODUCTION \nThe parties, by counsel, enter into this Settlement Agreement (\"the Agreement\"), \nwhich they will submit to the Court for its approval.  The Agreement settles all claims of the \n\"Entry\" Class and \"Release\" Class certified by the Court, including, without limitation on the \ngenerality of the foregoing, claims of class representatives and absent class members who \nhave not opted out, for all money damages, attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, and \ninterest, by establishing a common fund of $3 million, to be shared among participating \nclass members after payment of attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, claims administration \nexpenses, payment to class representatives, and payment to deposed class members, as \nprovided  in ¶¶ 30 and 31 below.  Under this Agreement class members will receive one \npayment no matter how many times they were admitted into and/or searched while \nincarcerated at the Hopkins County Detention Center (\"the Jail\") during the class period. \n \n\n \nII.  TERMS \nA.  Notice \n1.  Notice of the settlement shall issue on or before August 18, 2008, both \ndirectly to the last known addresses of all potential class members and by publication, and \nin a form to be agreed upon by the parties, approved by the Court, and intended to \nmaximize notice to the class and ease the filing of proofs of claim and administration of the \nsettlement. \nB.   Settlement Fund \n2.  Defendants will provide a settlement fund of $3 million to settle all claims of \nPlaintiffs and the classes, including claims for attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses, costs \nof administering the settlement, and interest, if any. \n3.  The parties agree and acknowledge that Defendants have denied liability in \nwhole, and that the payment and other agreements contained herein were made and were \ngiven without admission of liability which is expressly denied, and which payment and other \nagreements were made and given by Defendants solely for the purpose of avoiding the \nexpense of litigation, attorneys’ fees, and other costs. No language contained in this \nAgreement or in any orders issued by the Court approving or denying either preliminary or \nfinal approval to this Agreement shall in any way be construed as acknowledgments or \nadmissions of liability, all of which are expressly denied by Defendants. \n4.  Defendants and their counsel agree to provide reasonable assistance to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel and to the Claims Administrator to facilitate the administration of this \nsettlement by providing access to data, information and documents necessary to determine \nthe last known address and contact information for all potential class members.  Any \n  2 \n\n \ninformation provided pursuant  to such disclosure order shall be used only in connection \nwith this litigation, and shall be kept confidential and not disclosed to anyone other than \nPlaintiffs' counsel and the Claims Administrator except as set forth in this Agreement. \n5.  Any request for such additional fees and costs shall be by application to the \nCourt with opportunity for objection by Defendants.  No such motion shall be allowed nor \nany additional fees or costs paid by the Defendants due to delays in the claims process for \nany reason, provided the Defendants have paid the $3 million settlement proceeds set forth \nin ¶ 2 above to the Claims Administrator to establish the settlement fund in accordance with \nthis Agreement.  The payment of said amount shall fulfill and satisfy any and all financial \nobligations of the Defendants under this Agreement and no further fees or costs of  any \nkind shall be paid by the Defendants. \n6.  Defendants shall maintain and control the settlement funds until such time as \nthey are distributed to the Claims Administrator, who shall set up an interest bearing bank \naccount  or  accounts at  a bank  within  the Commonwealth of  Kentucky,  as may  be \nappropriate, for payment of the qualifying individual claims which may be allowed under this \nAgreement.  The Claims Administrator shall also post a bond and obtain appropriate \ninsurance  to  guarantee  the  performance  of  the  obligations  required  of  the  Claims \nAdministrator under this Agreement and to pay for any claims of liability in connection with \nadministration of the settlement fund.  Such funds shall be distributed to qualified claimants \nby the Claims Administrator within 30 days of entry of the Court's Order resolving any \nappeals of disqualified claimants and dismissing this case. \n  3 \n\n \nIII.  COURT SUPERVISION \n7.  Defendants  shall  be  obligated  to  perform  their  obligations  under  this \nAgreement upon the Court's entry of an order approving this Agreement after a fairness \nhearing pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (e).  After entry of such order, this case shall remain \npending during administration of the settlement. The Court may enter orders as appropriate \nto enforce this Agreement, to adjudicate the rights and responsibilities of the parties, to \nresolve appeals from Defendants and/or disqualified claimants, and to effect fair and \norderly administration, as necessary, of the settlement fund.  After distribution of all \nsettlement proceeds and satisfaction and completion of all duties and responsibilities \nimposed by this Agreement, the Court shall enter an order of dismissal effecting the \ndismissal of all class claims against Defendants with prejudice, and incorporating the terms \nof this Agreement pursuant to Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375 (1994).  \n8.  Any deadlines, dates, or other details in this Agreement may be amended \nonly by agreement of the parties and after approval of the Court on a showing of good \ncause. \nIV.  FAIRNESS HEARING PURSUANT TO RULE 23 (e) FED. R. CIV. P. \n9.  A fairness hearing regarding this settlement will be conducted on October 20, \n2008, beginning at 9:00 a.m., before the United States District Court in Owensboro, \nKentucky.  The deadline for filing claims shall be set for a date not less than 60 days \nfollowing the fairness hearing and the Order approving this Agreement. \n  4 \n\n \nV.  CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR \n10.  Class counsel recommends that Analytics, Inc.  be approved by the Court as \nClaims Administrator.  Analytics, Inc. has substantial experience in processing claims filed \nby claimants in class action settlements similar in size and scope to the settlement in this \naction, and performing related administrative work and, if approved by the Court at the \npreliminary approval hearing, shall be retained by Plaintiffs’ counsel under a contract \nrequiring a bond or surety to Defendants for the settlement funds, with all payments being \npaid from the settlement fund.  Counsel for the parties and the parties themselves shall \nhave no responsibility or liability for administering the settlement. \n11.  The Claims Administrator will administer notice to class members in the \nmanner prescribed by the Court; shall accept and docket all claim forms; shall send copies \nof all objections to the settlement to counsel for the parties on a rolling basis as soon as \npracticable after they are received; shall send copies of all claims forms to counsel for the \nparties on a rolling basis as soon as practicable after they are received, who shall have an \nopportunity to object; shall sustain or overrule any objections of Defendants to claims \nmade, subject to further appeal to the Court; shall send all notices that a claim has been \neither accepted or rejected to class members; shall resolve any appeals of claim denials, \nsubject to further appeal to the Court; shall calculate the amount of each claim pursuant to \nthe formula set out in this Agreement; shall distribute settlement funds to approved \nclaimants;  and shall report to the Court as necessary including providing a final report. \n12.  Counsel for the parties will oversee settlement administration and will provide \ndirection to the Claims Administrator as needed.  In the event of any dispute as to whether \nany of the parties has failed to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the parties \n  5 \n\n \nshall contact the Court in an effort to resolve any such dispute prior to filing any motion \nseeking specific performance.  \nVI.

A Notice of Settlement and Settlement Claim Form will be made available \nto anyone who requests such information.  Claim forms will be available on request through \nthe Claims Administrator including through a toll-free number.  \n14.

The Claims Administrator will send a claim form to anyone who requests one \nbefore the time for filing claim forms has expired.  The Claims Administrator will also \nmaintain a toll-free number for claimants to call to request a claim form or with questions.  \nThis number will be operational for at least five months following Court approval of this \nAgreement. \n18.

Alternatively, or in addition to filing a \nwritten objection, an objector may appear in person or through counsel at the fairness \nhearing when the objection will be considered by the Court.  The objecting class member \nmust also submit a Settlement Claim Form to the Claims Administrator if he wishes to be \n  8 \n\n \neligible to share in the settlement should it be approved despite his objection. \nVII.

The Claims Administrator will consult with counsel for the parties and \nmake a determination on each appeal no later than 30 days after the deadline for class \nmembers to file such appeals.  The Claims Administrator will inform the class member in \nwriting of its determination, and provide copies to all counsel within 30 days of such \ndetermination.  In order to object to the Claims Administrator’s final determination that he is \n  9 \n\n \nnot a class member, a claimant must file a written appeal with the Court postmarked no \nlater than 15 days after the date of the mailing of the final Notice of Claim Denial.  Rulings \nby the Claims Administrator may also be appealed by the parties directly to the Court within \n15 days of the receipt of the notice from the Claims Administrator approving or denying the \nclaim.

Plaintiffs’  attorneys'  fees  and  litigation  expenses  will  be  paid  from  the \nsettlement funds. \n28.  Class  counsel  will  be  paid  only  the  actual  attorney  fees  and  litigation \nexpenses incurred in this litigation, not to exceed $1.5 million. \n29.  Plaintiffs' litigation expenses and attorney's fee will be calculated and paid \nwithin 30 days of entry of the Order approving this Agreement following the fairness \nhearing.  Claims administration costs, including but not limited to any additional attorney \nfees and expenses incurred by Plaintiffs' counsel after June 9, 2008, will be calculated and \n  10 \n\n \npaid within 30 days of entry of the Order of Dismissal by the Court.  In addition, any copy \ncosts incurred by Defendants pursuant to the obligation described in ¶16 above will be \nitemized and submitted to the Claims Administrator and counsel for Plaintiffs prior to entry \nof the Order of Dismissal, and will also be paid within 30 days of entry of the Order of \nDismissal.  \nIX.  DISTRIBUTION TO CLASS MEMBERS \n   30.  Named class representatives Eddie Sutton and Lester Hank Turner (the first \nand  originating  plaintiffs  in  this  case)  will  receive  $35,000.00  each;  named  class \nrepresentatives Robin Littlepage, Tim May, Tabitha Nance, Ladonia Nelson, Linda Ford \nand Robert Teague $25,000.00 each; and named class representatives Daniel Todd and \nTony Ward $15,000.00  each,  in full  and final  settlement  of  all  their  claims  against \nDefendants as well as for their service as named class representatives, including but not \nlimited  to  surrendering  their  anonymity,  bringing  suit,  submitting  to  discovery,  and \nparticipating in and authorizing the settlement of this class action as set forth herein, all in \ncomplete satisfaction and discharge of their duties as named class representatives.  Their \nchecks shall issue within 30 days of entry of the Order approving this Agreement following \nthe fairness hearing. \n31.  In addition to the above, all class members who have valid claims, who have \nbeen deposed in these proceedings, and who submit a claim form, shall be paid $4,000.00 \neach in full and final settlement of all their claims against Defendants.  A list identifying \nsuch persons is attached hereto as Appendix A.   \n32.  All remaining class members will receive payment from the settlement funds \nthat  remain after  deducting  attorneys’ fees,  litigation  expenses, expenses of  claims \n  11 \n\n \nadministration,  payments  to  class  representatives,  and  payments  to  deposed  class \nmembers.  Persons subjected only to one or more strip-searches on admission to the Jail, \nor one or more strip-searches after they became entitled to release from the Jail, and thus \nare members of only the \"Entry\" Class or the \"Release\" Class, will be paid an amount up to \nbut not exceeding $1500.00, depending upon the number of approved claimants to the \nsettlement fund, in full and final settlement of all their claims against Defendants.  Persons \nsubjected both to one or more strip-searches on admission to the Jail and one or more \nstrip-searches after they became entitled to release from the Jail, and thus are members of \nboth the \"Entry\" Class and the \"Release\" Class, will be paid an amount up to but not \nexceeding $2500.00 depending upon the number of approved claimants to the settlement \nfund, in full and final settlement of all their claims against Defendants. \n33.  The Claims Administrator will calculate the amount of money due each class \nmember by assigning three points to every approved claimant who is a member of only one \nof the certified classes.  Approved claimants who are members of both classes will be \nassigned five points.  The Claims Administrator will divide the amount remaining in the \nsettlement fund (after the payments made as provided  above) by the total number of points \nto determine the amount each approved claimant will receive.  Class members will receive \nonly one payment no matter how many times they were admitted into and/or searched \nwhile incarcerated at the Jail during the class period. \n34.    Each class member’s check will be made payable only in his or her name or, \nupon the death of a class member, to the personal representative of the deceased class \nmember’s estate upon filing an affidavit in compliance with the applicable statutory \nprocedure for collection of personal property by affidavit of the rightful heir.   The check will \n  12 \n\n \nbe mailed to the class member at their mailing address.  Any change of address request \nmust be made in writing and must be signed by the claimant. \n35.  If a participating class member is confined in a prison, hospital, or other \ninstitution and has provided the address of such institution for payment, the settlement \ncheck will be sent to an appropriate institutional address unless the class member makes \nother acceptable arrangements in writing with the Claims Administrator.  If a claimant’s \ncheck is returned and the Claims Administrator has no record of a forwarding address,  the \nClaims Administrator, after consulting with counsel for the parties, shall have discretion to \ntake reasonable steps to locate such claimant. \nX.  POST-DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION \n36.  Any settlement funds remaining after all payments contemplated by this \nSettlement Agreement have been paid will be returned by the Claims Administrator to \nDefendants. \n 37.    At  the  conclusion  of  the  claims  administration  process,  the  Claims \nAdministrator shall provide a full and complete report to the parties and the Court that will \ninclude: (a) a list of approved claimants and the amounts paid to each; (b) a list of \nindividuals whose claims were rejected by the administrator and the reasons therefor; and \n(c) a detailed accounting of all expenses incurred by and fees of the Claims Administrator. \nXI.  DECEASED CLASS MEMBERS \n38.  If a class member is deceased, a legally authorized representative may file a \nSettlement Claim Form on behalf of the estate.  However, the representative must provide \nto the Claims Administrator the documentation required by ¶ 34 above, as well as a \ncertified  copy  of  the  Probate  Court  order  appointing  the  person  as  the  authorized \n  13 \n\n \nrepresentative of the deceased class member prior to the claims’ deadline, or the claim will \nbe denied. \nXII.  RELEASE \n \n39.  In consideration of payment of the settlement amount, Defendants will be \nreleased from all liability for all class members’ claims for all strip- searches that were part \nof this lawsuit including class members who do not file claims, except for any class \nmembers who requested exclusion and filed a claim within the statute of limitations.  The \nparties have expressly agreed that the release of claims arising from the settlement \nincludes all visual inspections, including without limitation visual body cavity inspections, \nthat otherwise fall within the scope of the claims certified as a class action by the Court in \nthis case.  The parties also agree that all such claims against all of Defendants' employees \nand other agents are barred because the settlement expressly covers Defendants, its \nemployees and agents.  Class members will be afforded an opportunity for exclusion as \nprovided for in Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(3), and as specified in the Notice of Settlement which will \nbe submitted to the Court for approval. \n  14 \n\n \n \nFor Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class: \nDate: July 17, 2008       /s/ Gregory A.

Between January 9, 2002 and June 2, 2008 (inclusive), you were strip-searched on admission to the Hopkins \nCounty Detention Center (“the Jail”) after your arrest for a qualifying non-violent, non-drug related \nmisdemeanor offense and without regard to whether there existed a reasonable, individualized suspicion \nthat you might be carrying or concealing weapons or contraband; and/or\n2.   Between January 9, 2002 and June 2, 2008 (inclusive), after your arrest for a minor offense, you were strip-\nsearched after you became entitled to be released from the Jail pursuant to an order of the court, payment \nof bond, or any other reason.\n***NOTE:  You were “strip-searched” if you were required to remove all or part of your clothing for visual \ninspection of  your buttocks, breasts and/or genitalia.\nMany reasons exist as to why you might not be a member of the class. Those reasons are too numerous to list in detail \nhere. If you submit a claim and are not deemed to be a class member, the class administrator will inform you as to the \nreason(s) for that decision.\nA $3 million settlement has been proposed in a class action lawsuit about alleged illegal strip-searches that took place \nwhen persons were admitted to, or became eligible for release from, the Jail at any time from January 9, 2002, to June \n2, 2008 (inclusive).  The settlement fund may pay cash to those who submit valid claims after deducting attorneys’ fees, \nthe costs and expenses of administering this settlement, and the payouts to the class representatives and deponents.  \nYou are receiving this notice because records show that you may be a class member. To see if you qualify, you must \nsubmit a complete Settlement Claim Form, postmarked by December 31, 2008, to: \nTurner Claims Administrator\nP.O. Box 2002\nChanhassen, MN 55317-2002\nIf you submit a claim form and qualify as a class member, you will be eligible to share in this settlement. The amount \nof money you receive depends on the following:\n1.  The money remaining after payment of the attorneys’ fees, the costs of this litigation, the costs of \nadministering this settlement, and the payouts to the class representatives; and\n2.  The number of timely, valid claims submitted.\n\nTHESE ARE YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT: \nSUBMIT A  This is the only way to get a payment. Remember: Claim Forms postmarked \nCLAIM FORM after December 31, 2008 will not be considered for payment.\nIf you exclude yourself, you will not be bound by the Settlement or judgment. You \nwill not get a cash payment in this case. You will be free to pursue your claims \nagainst the defendants at your own expense. This is the only option that allows \nEXCLUDE YOURSELF you to bring your own lawsuit for the claims raised in this case. You must exclude \nyourself from the Settlement by October 10, 2008.  If you exclude yourself, \nhowever, you will not be allowed to rejoin this class action and your individual \nclaim may be barred by the statute of limitations and you may get nothing.\nIf you want to object to the settlement but you do not exclude yourself, you may \nobject by writing to the Claims Administrator explaining why you believe the \nsettlement is not fair, postmarked no later than October 10, 2008, or you may \nOBJECT\nappear in Court at the Fairness Hearing on October 20, 2008 at 9 a.m.  If you \nhave not checked in at the court by 9 a.m. CDT, your appeal will not be heard. \nYou must also submit a claim form to preserve your right to receive payment.\nYou get no payment. You will still be bound by the settlement and you give up \nDO NOTHING\nyour right to sue the defendants or employees of the state on these claims later.\nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS\nHow much will my payment be?\nWe do not yet know the amount of the payments.  The tentative settlement agreement reached between the parties and \npreliminarily approved by the Court dictates that a person who is a member of one class will receive payment not to \nexceed $1,500 and a person who is a member of both classes will receive payment not to exceed $2,500, even if the \nperson was strip searched more than once for each class.  Payments will not exceed $2,500.00 to any claimant, except \nfor the named or deposed plaintiffs as described below.  \nAttorneys’ fees and expenses will ﬁ rst be paid from the settlement fund.  The named plaintiffs believe that Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel are entitled to recoup their actual hourly fees and costs up to and including June 9, 2008, not to exceed \n$1.5 million, and any actual costs and attorney’s fees after that date.  The named plaintiffs will also be paid from the \nsettlement fund.  Class counsel requests, and Defendants have agreed to, payment of $250,000.00 to be divided among \nthe class representatives in full and ﬁ nal settlement of their claims against Defendants, as well as for several years \nof service as named class representatives, including, but not limited to surrendering their anonymity, bringing suit, \nsubmitting to depositions, and participating in and authorizing the settlement of this class action.  Further, certain class \nmembers have been deposed in this action, and the parties have agreed that those deponents who have valid claims are \nentitled to $4,000 each.\nThe remaining amount will be divided among the claimants who submit valid and timely claims.  The amount for each \nindividual claimant will depend on how many people submit valid claim forms and whether they are members of each \nof the two classes.  The amount per person will decrease as the number of forms submitted increases. \nHow can I get a payment?\nYou must ﬁ ll out the Settlement Claim Form completely and mail it to the Claims Administrator.  A Claim Form \nis included with this notice.  You can also obtain a Claim Form from the Website www.turnersettlement.com.  The \nenvelope must be postmarked no later than December 31, 2008; if it is not, your claim will be denied. \n2\n\nThe settlement check will be written in your name with your social security number.  Your check will be sent to your \nmailing address.  If you move, you must notify the Claims Administrator in writing of your new address or the check will \nbe sent to your old address.  If you are incarcerated, your check will be deposited in your Inmate Trust Fund Account.\nWhen will I get my payment?\nYou will not be paid until the settlement is approved by the Court and any appeals are complete.  The Court will hold a \nhearing on October 20, 2008, to decide whether to approve the settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate.  Settlement \nchecks will be issued after the Court approves the settlement and all appeals are completed.  You may visit the website \nor contact the Claims Administrator for updates.\nWill I have to pay taxes on my payment?\nYou may have to pay taxes on your payment.  You should consult your tax preparer when you ﬁ le your tax returns.  \nThe Claims Administrator will send you a 1099 Form.  (If you have questions about backup withholding, Form W-9 \nor Form 1099, call your tax preparer or the IRS Information Reporting Program Customer Service Section, toll free at \n(866) 455-7438, 8:30 am to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.)\nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT\nWhat is a Class Action and who are Class Members?\nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case, Edward Lee Sutton, Lester Hank Turner, \nRobin Littlepage, Tim May, Tabitha Nance, Ladonia Nelson, Linda Ford, Robert Teague, Daniel Todd and Tony Ward), \nsue on behalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of the people who were similarly treated are known as a Class \nor Class Members.  One court resolves the issues for all Class Members. \nWhat claims will be released by this Settlement?\nThis settlement resolves all claims alleging illegal strip-searches that took place when persons were admitted to or \nreleased from the Jail from January 9, 2002, to June 2, 2008 (inclusive).  The settlement releases all of these claims \nagainst the Jail and its employees.  The settlement does not release any other claims, for example claims of wrongful \narrest or excessive force.  If you wish to pursue claims that are not covered by the settlement, you must ﬁ le an individual \nlawsuit on your own behalf.  These claims may be barred by the statute of limitations.\nHow do I know if I am a Class Member and part of the Settlement?\nYou are a Class Member if you meet ALL factors below:\n1.   Between January 9, 2002 and June 2, 2008 (inclusive), you were strip-searched on admission to the Hopkins \nCounty Detention Center (“the Jail”) after your arrest for a qualifying non-violent, non-drug related \nmisdemeanor offense and without regard to whether there existed a reasonable, individualized suspicion \nthat you might be carrying or concealing weapons or contraband; and/or\n2.   Between January 9, 2002 and June 2, 2008 (inclusive), after your arrest for a minor offense, you were strip-\nsearched after you became entitled to be released from the Jail pursuant to an order of the court, payment of \nbond, or any other reason.\n***NOTE:  You were “strip-searched” if you were required to remove all or part of your clothing for visual \ninspection of  your buttocks, breasts and/or genitalia.\nNOTE: You are not a class member if you were either (1) strip-searched while you were serving a sentence or after a \njudge had ordered that you be kept in jail while awaiting trial, (2) you were strip-searched because a correctional ofﬁ cer \nhad a reasonable suspicion to believe that you were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband, (3) you were arrested \nfor and/or charged with a crime involving a felony or other non-qualifying offense, or (4) your prior incarceration record \njustiﬁ ed a strip search. This list is not exhaustive. There could be other reasons why you are not a member of the class. \n3\n\nWhat if I was arrested for more than one crime?\nThe most serious charge for an arrest will determine your class membership.  If any one of the charges was a crime \ninvolving weapons or drugs, or a felony, you are not a class member for that arrest.\nWhat if I was found not guilty of the crime for which I was arrested?\nYou are entitled to the same settlement amount whether you were found guilty or not guilty of the crime.  However, if \nyou were strip searched after your arrest for a crime involving weapons or drugs, or a felony, you are not a class member \nregardless of whether you were subsequently found not guilty of the charge.\nWhat if I was arrested and strip searched more than once; can I still participate?\nYes.  As stated above, the tentative settlement agreement reached between the parties and preliminarily approved by the \nCourt dictates that a person who is a member of one class will receive payment not to exceed $1,500, and a person who \nis a member of both classes will receive payment not to exceed $2,500, even if that person were strip searched more \nthan once for each class.  Payments will not exceed $2,500 to any claimant, except for the named or deposed plaintiffs \nas described below.  \nWhat if I was at the jail before January 9, 2002?\nThe time period for being a class member is based on the legal requirement that a case must be ﬁ led within a certain time \nperiod; this is called the statute of limitations.  The law in Kentucky only allows a person to bring a claim within one \nyear after his or her rights were violated.  Because this case was ﬁ led on January 9, 2003, class members include only \nthose who were strip searched in the year before that date and thereafter.  If you were strip searched at the Jail before \nJanuary 9, 2002, it may be too late to bring a lawsuit.\nWhat if I am still unsure about whether I am part of the Settlement?\nIf you are unsure whether you are a member of the class, ﬁ ll out and return the Settlement Claim Form.  If the settlement \nis approved, you will be notiﬁ ed if you do not qualify.  If you qualify you may receive a check.  You may also visit \nthe settlement website on the Internet at www.turnersettlement.com, or call (866) 308-7614 to speak to a Settlement \nAdministrator or Class Counsel to answer your questions. \nWho makes the ﬁ nal decision about who qualiﬁ es as a Class Member?\nThe Claims Administrator makes the decision about who qualiﬁ es as a Class Member.  However, this decision is subject \nto review by the Court.  The records kept by the Jail will determine if you are a Class Member.  If the records do not \nshow that you ﬁ t the class deﬁ nition, or do not show that you have a qualifying claim, your claim will be denied.  You \ncan appeal your denial to the Claims Administrator by sending documentation and information regarding the dates \nyou believe you were held and strip searched.  A decision of the Claims Administrator can be appealed to the District \nCourt.  (If you are not a Class Member, you are not bound by this settlement, and can take action as an individual if you \nwish.)\nHow did the lawyers in this case ﬁ nd me and how can I protect my privacy?\nAfter you were arrested, you gave your name and address at the Jail.  The District Court ordered that this information be \ngiven to the lawyers for the plaintiffs.  The Court ordered that this information must remain conﬁ dential and cannot be \nfurther disclosed.  Only the lawyers in the case, the Claims Administrator, and the State’s administrators for collections \nof applicable liens will know your name and, in most cases, only those persons just mentioned who have been authorized \nby the Court’s Order will see your Claim Form.  Those persons who learn your identity as a result of this Settlement \ncannot disclose your private information.\nWhat should I do if I do not want to participate in the class action?\nIf you do not wish to participate in the class action, you can either exclude yourself or do nothing.  If you do not send in \na claim form, you will not be a participating Class Member and you will not receive a payment.  You will also be barred \nfrom ﬁ ling a case on these claims in the future.\n4\n\nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT\nIf I exclude myself, can I get money from this Settlement? \nNo, you will not get a payment from this settlement.  You will not be legally bound by the settlement.  You can bring \nyour own lawsuit.  However, your individual claim may be barred by the statute of limitations and you may get \nnothing.  Class counsel will not represent you in pursuing your claims.  If you exclude yourself, do not send in a Claim \nForm.  You cannot object to the settlement if you ask to be excluded.  A request to be excluded means you have opted \nout of this case.\nHow do I ask to be excluded from the settlement?\nTo exclude yourself from the settlement, you must send a letter by mail saying that you want to be excluded from Sutton, \net al. v. Hopkins County, et al.  Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and sign the letter.  You must \nmail your exclusion request postmarked no later than October 10, 2008, to the Claims Administrator at Turner Claims \nAdministrator, P.O. Box 2002, Chanhassen, MN 55317-2002.  The Claims Administrator will ﬁ le your notice with the \nCourt and counsel.  You cannot exclude yourself by phone or by e-mail.\nIf I do not exclude myself, can I sue the Jail for the same thing later? \nNo.  Unless you exclude yourself, you give up the right to sue the Jail or its employees for the claims that this settlement \nresolves.  This case resolves all claims for alleged illegal strip-searches that took place when persons were admitted to or \nreleased from the Jail from January 9, 2002, to June 2, 2008 (inclusive).  Remember, the exclusion deadline is October \n10, 2008. \nOBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT \nWhat if I think the proposed settlement is unfair? What can I do?\nIf you wish to object to the proposed settlement, you or a lawyer on your behalf must either state your objections to the \nCourt in a letter sent to the Claims Administrator, postmarked no later than October 10, 2008, or appear in the United \nStates District Court, Western District of Kentucky at Owensboro, 423 Frederica St, Owensboro, KY 42301, on \nOctober 20, 2008 at 9 a.m. CDT to present your objections.

If you write, the Claims Administrator will forward your objection to \nthe Court and to the lawyers.\nYou may object to the proposed settlement and still be eligible to receive a payment.  If you wish to claim money should \nthe settlement be approved, you must submit a valid Settlement Claim Form by the December 31, 2008 deadline even \nif you object to the settlement.\nTHE COURT’S FAIRNESS HEARING\nWhat is a Fairness Hearing?\nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement.  The Court will consider whether the \nsettlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  The Court will also decide whether to approve the request for attorneys’ \nfees, costs, expenses and the recoveries by the named plaintiffs.  If the Court approves the proposed settlement, it will \naffect all class members. \nWhen and where is the hearing?\nThe Hearing will be at 9 a.m. CDT on October 20, 2008, in the United States District Court, Western District of \nKentucky at Owensboro, 423 Frederica St, Owensboro, KY 42301, before the Honorable Joseph McKinley, Judge.\n5\n\nDo I have to come to the hearing?

I'\",)i'  \nCASE NO.: 4:03CV-3-M \nEDWARD LEE SUTTON, LESTER H. TURNER, \nLINDA JOYCE FORD AND TIMOTHY D. MAY \nINDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS \nSIMILARLY SITUATED  PLAINTIFFS \nv. \nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY \nAND \nJIM LANTRIP INDIVIDUALLY AND \nIN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS JAILER \nOF HOPKlNS COUNTY, KENTUCKY  DEFENDANTS \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \nI.  Introduction \n1.  Edward  Lee  Sutton  and  Lester H.  Turner,  Plaintiffs,  file  this  action  in  their \nindividual capacity and on behalf of all persons arrested for minor offenses who were required \nby Defendants in the Hopkins County Jail (\"Jail\"), after becoming entitled to release, to remove \ntheir clothing for a visual inspection despite the absence of any reasonable suspicion that they \nwere  carrying  or  concealing  weapons  or  contraband  (\"the  Release  Class\").  This  class  of \nindividuals includes individuals who were strip searched just prior to their release from the Jail \nafter they were ordered released on their own recognizance; individuals who were strip searched \njust prior to release from the Jail after they were ordered released on bond and subsequent to \nposting of bond; and individuals who were strip searched just prior to their release from the Jail \nfor any other reason without reasonable grounds for believing that they were concealing weapons \n\nor contraband.  This subclass of people includes all individuals who were so treated from January \n9, 2002 to the present. \n2.  Linda Joyce Ford and Timothy D. May file this action in their individual capacity \nand on behalf of all persons arrested for minor offenses who were required by Defendants in the \nJ ail to remove their clothing for a visual inspection on admission to the Jail despite the absence \nof any reasonable suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. This \nsubclass of people includes all individuals who were so treated from  January 9,  2002 to  the \npresent. \n3.  Such searches have been and continue to be regularly conducted by Defendants \nand there are hundreds of members of each subclass.  There are questions of law and fact in this \ncase that are common to all members of each subclass.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of \ntheir  respective  subclass,  and  they  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests  of such \nsubclasses. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n4.  Plaintiffs, and all others similarly situated, seek actual and punitive damages from \nDefendants under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for gross and unconscionable \nviolations of the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed them by the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, \nNinth and  Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.  Accordingly, this \nCourt has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.c. §§1331  and 1343. \nPlaintiffs and the other members of their class also seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well \nas  damages under the pendent jurisdiction of this Court for negligence, gross negligence and \nintentional infliction of emotional distress.  As Hopkins County, Kentucky, is the residence of all \n\ndefendant parties to this action and the location of all acts pertinent to this suit, venue is proper in \nthis Court. \nIII.  Class Action \n5.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(b )(1), (2) and (3) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are two subclasses before the Court. The first \nsubclass consists of all individuals arrested for minor offenses who were required to remove their \nclothing for a visual inspection on admission to the Jail despite the absence of any reasonable \nsuspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. \n6.  The second subclass consists of all persons who were required by Defendants in \nthe Jail, just after becoming entitled to release,  to  remove  all  of their clothing for  a visual \ninspection despite the absence of any reasonable suspicion that they were carrying or concealing \nweapons or contraband. \n7.  Plaintiffs will  fairly and adequately protect the interests of all class members. \nThey are members  of the  subclasses  and  their claims  are typical  of the claims  of all  class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs are offended at the treatment accorded them and the class members and will \naggressively pursue the interests of the entire class.  Plaintiffs' interest in obtaining injunctive \nrelief and  actual  and  punitive  damages  for  the  violations  of their  constitutional  rights  and \nprivileges are consistent with and not antagonistic of those of any other person within their \nsubclass. \n8.  Given the circumstances of their search, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, on \ninformation  and  belief,  that Defendants regularly require  all persons  arrested  for  nonviolent \nminor offenses to remove their clothing for a visual inspection of their bodies on admission to \nthe jail and all inmates after their return from Court appearances and prior to their release from \n\nthe Hopkins County Jail, even though (a) there exists no reasonable grounds for believing that \nweapons or contraband have been concealed upon their persons and (b) such persons have been \nordered released on their own recognizance.  Such searches violate the Fourth,  Fifth, Eight, \nNinth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Title 42 U.S.C.  § 1983, \nBell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979) and the clearly established law of this circuit, as set forth in \nMasters v.  Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.), cert denied, 493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503 (1989). \nThe only question that remains to be resolved is whether Plaintiffs and the members of the class \nare entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, or to  an award of compensatory and punitive \ndamages and, if so, the extent of such an award. \n9.  A class action is  superior to  other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjUdication of this controversy because: \n(a)  A  multiplicity  of suits  with  consequent  burden  on  the \ncourts and Defendants should be avoided. \n(b)  It would be virtually impossible for  all class members to \nintervene as parties-plaintiff in this action. \n(c)  Upon adjUdication of Defendants'  liability,  claims of the \nclass members can be determined by this Court. \nIV.  Parties \n10.  Plaintiffs  are  residents  of  various  counties  within  the  Commonwealth  of \nKentucky. \n11.  Defendant  Hopkins  County,  at  all  times  mentioned  herein,  employed,  was \nresponsible  for  the  establishment  of policies  either  formally  or  by  custom  for,  and  was \nresponsible for the employment, training, supervision and conduct of, the officers and employees \nof the Hopkins County Jail. \n\n12.  Defendant  Jim  Lantrip  is  Jailer  of Hopkins  County,  and  as  such  established \npolicies  formally  or  by  custom  for,  and  was  responsible  for  the  employment,  training, \nsupervision and conduct of, the officers and employees of the Hopkins County Jail. \nV.  Nature of Defendants' Conduct \n13.  Defendants,  individually  and  in  conspiracy with one  another,  engaged  in  the \nconduct  described  below  under  color  of the  law  of the  Commonwealth  of Kentucky  and \nHopkins.  The offenses described below resulted from the failure of the state and county agencies \nand  individuals to  employ qualified persons for  positions of authority,  and/or to properly or \nconscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such persons after their employment, and/or to \npromulgate appropriate operating policies and procedures either formally or by custom to protect \nthe constitutional rights of the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Defendants' conduct \nwas intentional or grossly negligent, or indicated active malice toward Plaintiffs and the class or \nat least a total and reckless disregard for and indifference to their constitutional and common law \nrights, justifying an award of punitive damages in addition to the actual damages which Plaintiffs \nand the class are entitled to recover. \nVI.  Facts \n14.  On June 28, 2002, Plaintiffs Edward Lee Sutton and Lester Turner were arrested \nfor a violation ofKRS 222.202 (alcohol intoxication), a misdemeanor offense, and were taken to \nthe Hopkins County Jail.  Because their offense, their background and their behavior did not \ngenerate any suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband on their \npersons, Plaintiffs were not strip-searched upon admission to the Hopkins County Jail.  Plaintiffs \nwere subsequently taken to Court where they were ordered released on their own recognizance. \nInstead of being released immediately, Plaintiffs were taken back to the Hopkins County Jail \n\n\"  , \nand,  pnor  to  their  release,  were  strip-searched,  apparently because  of the  requirements  of \nParagraph 1 (c) of the written policy of the Hopkins County Jail, a copy of which is attached \nhereto as Exhibit 1. \n15.  Plaintiff Linda Joyce Ford was arrested in September, 2002  for  writing a bad \ncheck.,  a violation of KRS  514.040, a misdemeanor offense,  and was taken to  the Hopkins \nCounty Jail. Plaintiff was taken into a room where she was told to take off her clothes, squat on \nthe floor and cough. Then she was forced to tum around, bend over, spread her buttocks and \ncough.  Plaintiff Timothy D.  May was  subjected  to  similar treatment.  On  October 9,  2002, \nTimothy  May  was  arrested  for  speeding  ten  miles  over  the  speed  limit,  opearating  on  a \nsuspended license and for failure to pay a ticket. He was taken to the Hopkins County Jail, where \nhe was told take off all of his clothes, lift his genitals, tum around, bend over, and spread his \nbuttocks. \nVII.  The Law and Defendants' Policy \n16.  In 1979, the United States Supreme Court held that a pretrial detainee has the \nright  not  to  be  searched  unless  the  reasonableness  of such  a  search  is  established  by \n\"balancing ... the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.\"  Bell v.  Wolfish supra at 559 (emphasis added).  On April 18, 1989, the Sixth \nCircuit issued its opinion in Masters v. Crouch, supra, in which it held: \nIt was clearly established on October 21,  1986, ... that a person \ncharged only with a traffic violation or nonviolent minor offense \nmay not be SUbjected to a strip-search unless there are reasonable \ngrounds for believing that the particular person might be carrying \nor concealing weapons or other contraband. \n!d.  at 1257.  In this case, Plaintiffs were arrested for nonviolent minor offenses.  Neither their \nbehavior nor their background gave Defendants any reasonable grounds for believing that they \nmight be  carrying  or concealing weapons  or other contraband.  Under  such  circumstances, \n\n--------------------------\nDefendants' requirement that Plaintiffs - on admission, and after they had been ordered released \n-- expose  the  most  private  part  of their  physical  persons  for  a  visual  inspection  was \nunconscionable, was an illegal strip-search by any definition, and was a flagrant violation of the \nbalancing requirement of Bell v.  Wolfish, supra. \nVIII.  Causes of Action \nA.  Count I \n17.  Paragraph  1-16  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 17. \n18.  Plaintiffs'  searches,  described  above,  were  part  of a  continuing  pattern  of \nmisconduct and is the result of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, procedures, customs \nand  practices  of the  Commonwealth  of Kentucky  and  Hopkins  County,  either  written  or \nunwritten, that are systematically applied whenever an arrestee is admitted to or released from \nthe Hopkins County Jail.  Such practices constitute an arbitrary use of government power, and \nevince a total, intentional and unreasonable disregard for the constitutional and common law \nrights of the citizens of Kentucky, including Plaintiffs and the members of the class, and the \nwholesale violations of those rights likely to result from the systematic pursuit of such practices. \n19.  As  a result of the  foregoing,  Plaintiffs and their classes, through Defendants' \nintentional  or grossly negligent  conduct,  were  deprived without  due  process  of law  of the \nfollowing rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United \nStates in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871,42 U.S.C. § 1983: \n(a)  Their right to be secure in their person against unreasonable \nsearches  and  seizures  under  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments; \n\n--- - -------------•--- ----------------- • \n1  ..(,.  , \n(b)  Their right to privacy in their person against unreasonable \nintrusions  under the  Fourth,  Fifth,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments; \n(c)  Their right to the equal protection of the law secured by the \nFourteenth Amendment; and \n(d)  Their  right  not  to  be  subjected  to  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n20.  Moreover, given the pre-existing law that clearly prohibited Defendants' conduct, \nDefendants' searches of Plaintiffs and the members of their subclass were intentional, wanton \nand malicious, and were indicative of Defendants' total and reckless disregard of, indifference to \nthe rights of, and risk of harm to, Plaintiffs and the other members of the class. \nB.  Count II \n2l.  Paragraphs  1-20  above  are  incorporated  herein  by reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 21. \n22.  By  virtue  of the  foregoing,  Defendants,  without justification,  negligently  or \nintentionally inflicted upon Plaintiffs and the subclasses severe mental and emotional distress. \nC.  Count III \n23.  Paragraphs  1-22  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 23. \n24.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants were negligent, and grossly negligent, all \nto the damage of Plaintiffs and the subclasses. \nIX.  Damages \n25.  Paragraphs  1-24  above  are  incorporated  herein  by reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 25. \n26.  Plaintiffs and the members ofthe classes were unjustifiably and unconstitutionally \nsearched in a manner that generated tremendous and overwhelming embarrassment, humiliation \n\n•  • \n\"  , \nand mental and emotional distress.  As a result, they have suffered, and are entitled to recover, \nactual  damages.  Furthermore, Defendants'  violations of the constitutional and common law \nrights  of Plaintiffs  and  the  classes were  cruel,  malicious,  and  evinced  a  total  and  reckless \ndisregard for and indifference to those rights, entitling Plaintiffs and the class to recover punitive \ndamages from Defendants in order to deter such conduct in the future. \nX.  Declaratory Judgment and Permanent Injunction \n27.  Paragraphs  1-26  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 27. \n28.  In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiffs and the class request that this Court issue a \ndeclaratory judgment deeming unconstitutional  any  and  all  statutes,  ordinances,  regulations, \npolicies, procedures, customs or practices under which they were forced to expose their genitalia \nfor visual inspection, and further request that this Court permanently enjoin Defendants from \nfollowing or enforcing such statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, procedures, customs or \nusages. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the subclasses they represent request (a) that this action \nproceed as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and (b) a trial by jury, and further request that \nthey and all members ofthe class (c) be awarded actual and punitive damages, (d) be granted the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief requested herein, and (e) be awarded their costs, attorneys' fees, \npre and post judgment interest and all other relief to which they are entitled under law or in \nequity. \n\n• \nRespectfully Submitted, \nDINSMORE & SHOHL LLP \naz \n500 West Jefferson Street \nLouisville, KY 40202 \n(502) 540-2300 (Telephone) \n(502) 585-2207 (Facsimile) \nand \nFROST BROWN TODD LLC \ncliens? \nJames R.

TURNER,  ELECTRONI('ALLY FILED \nLINDA JOYCE FORD, TIMOTHY D. MAY, \nLADONIA W. NELSON, ROBIN LITTLEPAGE, \nROBERT R. TEAGUE, TABITHA NANCE, TONY WARD \nAND DANIEL TODD, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF \nOF ALL OTHERS SIMILARL Y SITUATED  PLAINTIF:FS \nv. \nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY \nAND \nJIM LANTRIP, INDIVIDUALLY AND \nIN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS JAILER \nOF HOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY  DEFENDANTS \nTHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT \nI. Introduction \n1.  Plaintiffs Edward Lee Sutton, Lester H.  Turner, Linda Joyce ford, Timothy D. \nMay,  Ladonia W.  Nelson, Robin Littlepage, Robert Teague, Tabitha Nance, Tony Ward  and \nDaniel  Todd  file  this  action  individually  and  on  behalf  of  all  persons  SUbjected  to \nunconstitutional strip-searches on admission and/or release from the Hopkins County Jail since \nJanuary 9, 2002. \n2.  Edward Lee  Sutton,  Lester H.  Turner,  Ladonia  W.  Nelson,  Robin  Littlepage, \nRobert R.  Teague,  Tabitha  Nance,  Timothy  May  and  Linda  Ford  file  this  action  in· their \nindividual capacity and on behalf of all persons arrested for minor offenses who were required \nby Defendants in the Hopkins County Jail (\"Jail\"), after becoming entitled to release, to remove \n\ntheir clothing for a visual inspection despite the absence of any reasonable grounds for doing so \n(\"the Release Class\").  This class of individuals includes indi viduals who were strip searched just \nprior to their release from the Jail after they were ordered released on their own recognizance; \nindividuals who were strip searched just prior to release from the Jail after they were ordered \nreleased on bond and subsequent to posting of bond; and individuals who were strip searched \njust prior to their release from the Jail for any other reason without reasonable grounds for doing \nso.  This subclass of people includes all individuals who were so treated since January 9, 2002. \n3.  Linda  Joyce  Ford,  Timothy  D.  May,  Ladonia  W.  Nelson,  Robin  Littlepage, \nRobert R. Teague, Tabitha Nance, Daniel Todd and Tony Ward file this action in their individual \ncapacity and on behalf of all persons arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses \nwho were required by Defendal1ts in the Jail to remove their clothing for a visual inspection on \nadmission to the Jail despite the absence of any individualized reasonable suspicion that they \nwere  carrying  or  concealing  weapons  or  contraband.  This  subclass  of people  includes  all \nindividuals who were so treated from January 9, 2002 to the present. \n4.  Such searches have been and continue to be regularly conducted by Defendants \nand there are hundreds of members of each subclass.  There are questions of law and fact in this \ncase that are common to all members of each subclass.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of \ntheir  respective  subclass,  and  they  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect the  interests  of such \nsubclasses. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n5.  Plaintiffs, and all others similarly situated, seek actual and punitive damages from \nDefendants under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for gross and unconscionable \nviolations of the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed them by the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, \n\nNinth and  Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.  Accordingly, this \nCOUli has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to the provisions of 28  U.S.c. §§1331  and  1343. \nPlaintiffs and the other members of their class also seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well \nas damages under the pendent jurisdiction of this Court for negligence, gross negligence and \nintentional infliction of emotional distress.  As Hopkins County, Kentucky, is the residence of all \ndefendant parties to this action and the location of all acts pertinent to this suit, venue is proper in \nthis Court. \nIII.  Class Action \n6.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(l), (2) and (3) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are two subclasses before the Court. \n7.  The first subclass consists of all individuals an'ested for minor non-violent and \nnon-drug related offenses who were required to remove their clothing for a visual inspection on \nadmission to the Jail despite the absence of any individualized reasonable suspicion that they \nwere carrying or concealing weapons or contraband. \n8.  The second subclass consists of all persons who were required by Defendants in \nthe Jail,  after becoming entitled to release, to remove all of their clothing for a visual inspection \ndespite the absence of any reasonable grounds for doing so. \n9.  Plaintiffs will fairly  and  adequately protect the  interests of all  class members. \nThey are members of the subclasses and their claims are typical  of the  claims of all  class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs are offended at the treatment accorded them and the class members and will \naggressively pursue the interests of the entire class.  Plaintiffs' interest in obtaining injunctive \nrelief and  actual  and  punitive  damages  for  the  violations  of their  constitutional  rights  and \n\nprivileges are consistent with and not antagonistic of those of any  other person within their \nsubclass. \n10.  Given the circumstances of their search, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, on \ninformation and belief, that Defendants regularly require persons arrested for nonviolent, non-\ndrug related minor offenses to remove their clothing for a visual inspection of their bodies on \nadmission to the jail even though the Jail has not determined any individualized suspicion for \ndoing so and regularly require persons to remove their clothing for a visual inspection of their \nbodies  prior to  their release from  the  Hopkins  County Jail  even  though  (a)  there  exists  no \nreasonable  grounds  for  doing  so,  and  (b)  such  persons  have  been ordered  released.  Such \nsearches violate the Fourth, Fifth, Eight, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution, Title 42  U.S.C.  § 1983,  Bell v.  Wolfish,  441  U.S.  520  (1979)  and  the clearly \nestablished law of this circuit, as set forth in Masters v.  Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.), cel'f \ndenied, 493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503 (1989).  The only question that remains to be resolved is \nwhether Plaintiffs and the members of the class are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, \nor to an award of compensatory and punitive damages and, if so, the extent of such an award. \n11.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy because: \n(a)  A  mUltiplicity  of suits  with  consequent  burden  on  the \ncourts and Defendants should be avoided. \n(b)  It would be virtually impossible for all class members to \nintervene as parties-plaintiff in this action. \n(c)  Upon adjudication of Defendants'  liability, claims of the \nclass members can be determined by this Court. \n\nIV.  I)arties \n12.  Plaintiffs  are  residents  of  various  counties  within  the  Commonwealth  of \nKentucky. \n13.  Defendant  Hopkins  County,  at  all  times  mentioned  herein,  employed,  was \nresponsible  for  the  establishment  of policies  either  formally  or  by  custom  for,  and  was \nresponsible for the employment, training, supervision and conduct of, the officers and employees \nof the Hopkins County Jail. \n14.  Defendant  Jim  Lantrip  is  Jailer of Hopkins  County,  and  as  such  established \npolicies  formally  or  by  custom  for,  and  was  responsible  for  the  employment,  training, \nsupervision and conduct of, the officers and employees of the Hopkins County Jail. \nV.  Nature of Defendants' Conduct \n15.  Defendants,  individually  and  in  conspiracy  with  one  another,  engaged  in  the \nconduct described herein under color of the law of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Hopkins \nCounty.  The offenses described below resulted from the failure of the state and county agencies \nand individuals to employ qualified persons for positions of authority,  and/or to  properly or \nconscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such persons after their employment, and/or to \npromulgate appropriate operating policies and procedures either formally or by custom to protect \nthe constitutional rights of the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Defendants' conduct \nwas intentional or grossly negligent, or indicated active malice toward Plaintiffs and the class or \nat least a total and reckless disregard for and indifference to their constitutional and common law \nrights, justifying an award of punitive damages in addition to the actual damages which Plaintiffs \nand the class are entitled to recover. \n\nVI.  Facts \n16.  On June 28, 2002, Plaintiffs Edward Lee Sutton and Lester Turner were arrested \nfor a violation ofKRS 222.202 (alcohol intoxication), a misdemeanor offense, and were taken to \nthe Hopkins County Jail.  Sutton and Turner were not strip-searched upon admission to  the \nHopkins County Jail.  They were subsequently taken to Court where they were ordered released \non their own recognizance.  Instead of being released immediately, Sutton and Turner were \nreturned to the Hopkins County Jail and, prior to their release, were strip-searched, apparently \nbecause of the requirements of Paragraph 1 (c) of the written policy of the Hopkins County Jail, \na copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. \n17.  Plaintiff Linda Joyce Ford was arrested in September, 2002, for writing a bad \ncheck,  a  violation of KRS  514.040, a misdemeanor offense, and  was  taken  to  the  Hopkins \nCounty Jail. Upon entry to the Jail, Ford was taken into a room where she was required to takc \noff her clothes, squat on the floor and cough. She was then forced to turn around, bend over, \nspread her buttocks and cough.  Upon  release from the Jail, Ford was  again SUbjected to  an \nunconstitutional strip search prior to being allowed to leave the Jail. \n18.  On October 9, 2002, Timothy May was arrested for speeding ten miles over the \nspeed  limit, operating on a suspended license and for failure to  pay  a ticket.  Each  of these \noffenses are a misdemeanor.  On entry to the Hopkins County Jail, May was forced to take off all \nturn \nof his clothes, lift his genitals,  around, bend over, and spread his buttocks. Upon release \nfrom the Jail, May was again SUbjected to an unconstitutional strip search prior to being allowed \nto leave the Jail. \n19.  Plaintiff Ladonia Nelson was subject to an unconstitutional strip search on four \noccasions.  In  February,  2002  and  May  2002,  she  was  atTested  for  minor  non-drug  related \n\noffenses. She was pregnant during both incarcerations. She was forced to remove her clothing on \na number of occasions, squat, spread her buttocks, and cough. These searches occurred upon \nentry to the jail and immediately prior to her release. \n20.  Plaintiff Robin Littlepage was arrested in August, 2002, for charges related to \nfailure to make an appearance. Upon entry to the Jail, Hopkins County officers forced her to \nremove her clothing, lift her breasts, squat for an inspection, and cough. Immediately prior to her \nrelease,  Littlepage was forced  to  remove her clothing in the presence of a Hopkins  County \nofficer. \n21.  Plaintiff Robert Teague was arrested in January, 2003, for writing a bad check, a \nviolation ofKRS 514.040, a misdemeanor offense. Upon entry to the Jail, Teague was forced to \nsubmit to a physical inspection of his body by removing his clothes and spreading his buttocks. \nImmediately prior to his release, he was forced to remove his clothing in front of a Hopkins \nCOWlty officer. \n22.  Plaintiff Tabitha Nance was arrested in May, June, and October, 2003, for theft by \ndeception for writing a bad check. On each occasion, Nance was subjected to an unconstitutional \nstrip search at the Hopkins County Jail upon entry and release. On at least one occasion, Nance, a \nfemale, was forced to submit to an unconstitutional strip search by a male guard. \n23.  Plaintiff Tony Ward was arrested in May 2004 for a non-violent non-drug related \nminor offense. Upon entry to the Jail, Mr. Ward was forced to submit to an unconstitutional strip \nsearch in front ofa Hopkins County Jail officer. \n24.  Plaintiff Daniel  Todd  was  arrested  in  April  2003  for  a  non-violent  non-drug \nrelated  minor  offense.  Upon  entry  to  the  Jail,  Mr.  Ward  was  forced  to  submit  to  an \nunconstitutional strip search in front of a Hopkins County Jail officer. \n\nVII.  The Law and Defendants' Policy \n25.  In  1979, the United States Supreme Court held that a pretrial  detainee has the \nright  not  to  be  searched  unless  the  reasonableness  of such  a  search  is  established  by \nt \n\"balancing ... the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.\"  Bell v.  Wolfish,  supra at 559 (emphasis added).  On April  18,1989, the Sixth \nCircuit issued its opinion in Masters v.  Crouch, supra, in which it held: \nIt was clearly established on October 21, 1986, ... that a person \ncharged only with a traffic violation or nonviolent minor offense \nmay not be subjected to a strip-search unless there are reasonable \ngrounds for believing that the particular person might be caITying \nor concealing weapons or other contraband. \nrd. at 1257.  In this case, Plaintiffs were arrested for nonviolent minor offenses.  At the time of \nthe  unconstitutional  strip  searches,  Defendants  did  not  have  any  individualized  reasonable \nsuspicion that Plaintiffs might be carrying or concealing weapons or other contraband.  Under \nsuch circumstances, Defendants' requirement that Plaintiffs - on admission and after they had \nbeen ordered released -- expose the most private part of their physical persons for  a visual \ninspection was unconscionable, was an illegal strip-search by any definition, and was a flagrant \nviolation of the balancing requirement of Bell v.  Wolfish, supra. \nVIII.  Causes of Action \nA.  CountI \n26.  Paragraph  1-25  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 26. \n27.  Plaintiffs'  searches,  described  above,  were  part  of a  continuing  pattern  of \nmisconduct and is the result of policies, procedures, customs and practices of the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky and Hopkins County, either written or unwritten, that are systematically applied \n\nwhenever an arrestee is admitted to or released from the Hopkins County Jail.  Such practices \nconstitute an arbitrary use of government power, and evince a total, intentional and unreasonable \ndisregard for the constitutional and common law rights of the citizens of Kentucky, including \nPlaintiffs and the members of the class, and the wholesale violations of those rights likely to \nresult from the systematic pursuit of such practices. \n28.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs and their subclasses, through Defendants' \nintentional or grossly negligent conduct, were unconstitutionally detained in an environment that \ncommunicated to Plaintiffs that they would be subjected to physical force if they did not compl y \nwith  the  demands  to  be  strip  searched.  In  conducting these  unconstitutional  strip  searches, \nPlaintiffs were deprived without due process  of law of the  following  rights,  privileges and \nimmunities guaranteed them by the Consti~ution of the United States in violation of the Civil \nRights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983: \n(a)  Their right to be secure in their person against unreasonable \nsearches  and  seizures  under  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments; \n(b)  Their right to privacy in their person against unreasonable \nintrusions under the Fourth, Fifth,  Ninth and  Fourteenth \nAmendments; \n(c)  Their right to the equal protection of the law secured by the \nFourteenth Amendment; and \n(d)  Their  right  not  to  be  subjected  to  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n29.  Moreover, given the pre-existing law that clearly prohibited Defendants' conduct, \nDefendants' searches of Plaintiffs and the members of their subclass were intentional, wanton \nand malicious, and were indicative of Defendants' total and reckless disregard of, indifference to \nthe rights of, and risk of harm to, Plaintiffs and the other members of the class. \n\nB.  Countll \n30.  Paragraphs  1-29  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 30. \n31.  By  virtue  of the  foregoing,  Defendants,  without  justification,  negligently  or \nintentionally inflicted upon Plaintiffs and the subclasses severe mental and emotional distress. \nC.  Count III \n32.  Paragraphs  1-31  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 32. \n33.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants were negligent, and grossly negligent, all \nto the damage of Plaintiffs and the subclasses. \nIX.  Damages \n34.  Paragraphs  1-33  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 34. \n35.  Plaintiffs and the members of the classes were unjustifiably and unconstitutionally \nsearched in a manner that generated tremendous and overwhelming embarrassment, humiliation \nand mental and emotional distress.  As a result, they have suffered, and are entitled to recover, \nactual  damages.  Furthermore, Defendants'  violations of the constitutional and  common law \nrights  of Plaintiffs  and  the classes were  cruel,  malicious,  and  evinced  a total  and  reckless \ndisregard for and indifference to those rights, entitling Plaintiffs and the class to recover punitive \ndamages from Defendants in order to deter such conduct in the future. \nX.  Declaratory .Judgment and Permanent Injunction \n36.  Paragraphs  1-35  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 36. \n\n37.  In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiffs and the subclasses request that this Court \nlssue  a  declaratory  judgment  deeming  unconstitutional  any  and  all  statutes,  ordinances, \nregulations, policies, procedures, customs or practices under which they were forced to expose \ntheir genitalia  for  visual  inspection,  and  further  request that this  Court permanently  enjoin \nDefendants  from  following  or  enforcing  such  statutes,  ordinances,  regulations,  policies, \nprocedures, customs or usages. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the subclasses they represent request (a) that this action \nproceed as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and (b) a trial by jury, and further request that \nthey and all members of the class (c) be awarded actual and punitive damages, (d) be granted the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief requested herein, and (e) be awarded their costs, attorneys' fees, \npre and post judgment interest and all other relief to which they are entitled under law or in \nequity. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nsl  Bart L.

      "text": "77894 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nWESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY \nOWENSBORO DIVISION \nCASE NO.:  4:03CV-3-M \n \nEDWARD LEE SUTTON, LESTER H. TURNER, \nLINDA JOYCE FORD, TIMOTHY D. MAY, \nLADONIA W. WILSON, ROBIN LITTLEPAGE, \nROBERT R. TEAGUE, and TABITHA NANCE \nINDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS \nSIMILARLY SITUATED    PLAINTIFFS \n \nREPLY TO RESPONSE TO \nMOTION TO DECERTIFY CLASS \n v. \n \nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY \nAND \nJIM LANTRIP INDIVIDUALLY AND \nIN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS JAILER \nOF HOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY  DEFENDANTS \n \n   \n  Come the Defendants, Hopkins County, Kentucky and Jim Lantrip, in his \nindividual and official capacities (hereinafter \"Defendants\"), by and through the \nundersigned counsel, and for their Reply to Response to Motion to Decertify Class, \nhereby state as follows:  \nI.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Defendants have not failed to show any new facts or law that warrant \ndecertification. \n \n  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ Motion should be denied because they have \nfailed to show any new facts or law that warrant decertification.  In arguing that \nDefendants must put forth “newly developed facts or law in support of their desired \naction”, Plaintiffs cite a vacated Eight Circuit opinion (In re Exterior Siding and \nAluminum Coil Antitrust Litig., 696 F.2d 613 (8th Cir. 1982)(vacated by In re Exterior \n  1\n\nSiding and Aluminum Coil Antitrust Litig., 705 F.2d 980 (8th Cir. 1983) and two district \ncourt cases from New York and Pennsylvania.   \nThe New York case is easily distinguishable because it merely involved a Plaintiff \nrequesting an amendment to the certification order.  In re Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, \nInc., 838 F.Supp. 109, 115 (E.D.N.Y. 1993).  Of course a Plaintiff is required to set forth \na change in facts or law before the certification order is amended, as the Plaintiff always \ncarries the burden of proving the elements necessary for certification.  See In re \nAmerican Medical Systems, Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1079 (6th Cir. 1996).      \nAs to the Pennsylvania District Court opinion, Kramer v. Scientific Control \nCorp., although that District Court made the bold statement that Defendants must show \nnewly discovered facts or law to support their argument for decertification, the judge did \nnot cite any authority to support his proposition.  67 F.R.D. 98, 99 (E.D. Pa. 1975).   \nAs the Defendants explained in their Motion to Decertify, it is the Sixth Circuit’s \nposition that after certification, the district court must continue to ensure that the \nrequirements of class certification remain satisfied as the case progresses, and the court \nmay alter or amend the certification if the requirements are no longer met.  See e.g., \nBarney v. Holzer Clinic, Ltd., 110 F.3d 1207, 1214 (6th Cir.1997).  Obviously, since the \nSixth Circuit allows decertification sua sponte by the trial court, the Sixth Circuit \ntherefore does not require newly discovered facts or law to justify decertification.  It is \nsufficient if the requirements of class certification are no longer met, whatever that reason \nmay be.   \nRegardless of whether the Sixth Circuit requires newly developed facts, the \nDefendants offer the following that has occurred since certification: \n  2\n\n1.  Plaintiffs sent the Defendants 750 completed potential class member \nquestionnaires.   \n2.  Defendants’ counsel sifted through each of them individually, determining \nthat many fail to state a claim on their face.   \n3.  The inmate files obtained by Defendants’ counsel to date indicate a \nreasonable suspicion for strip search in two-thirds of the files reviewed.                          \n4.  Defendants’ counsel’s investigation of some of the 750 claims has \nrevealed that deputy jailers recall some of the potential class members’ incarcerations \nand can testify that no such strip searches occurred.1   Furthermore, in November, 2005, \nDefendants produced over 2,300 pages of strip search reports that have been maintained \nby Defendants since July 1, 2003.  (See Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Second \nRequest for Production of Documents, attached hereto as Exhibit “A”2).  Certainly, \nDefendants can use this evidence to rebut an unlawful strip search claim.       \n5.  Depositions of six of the ten Plaintiffs have been taken.  The depositions \n                                                 \n1 In their Response, Plaintiffs’ express their doubt that jailers will be able to recall whether a particular \nclass member was strip searched “many years before”.  However, maybe since Plaintiffs’ counsel are from \nLouisville they do not understand small towns.  Hopkins County and Madisonville (the County’s seat) are \nsmall.  Most people that live there went to school together, are neighbors, know someone that knows that \nperson, have kids that are in school together, etc.  As such, the deputy jailers personally know many of the \npeople that are incarcerated at the Hopkins County Detention Center.  As such, especially the incarcerations \nof friends, former schoolmates, neighbors, etc., will be memorable.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs have submitted \nclaims as recent as December, 2005, so many of the claims are not “many years before” as Plaintiffs allege.  \nAnd finally, as explained in Defendants’ Motion to Decertify, Deputy Jailers Tucker and Coy have already \ntestified in this case that they recall Sutton’s and Turner’s booking and release, as well as specific details \nabout the arrest.  Regardless, Plaintiffs’ doubt in this regard can be used to impeach the witnesses.  It is \nirrelevant for purposes of this Motion.  Whether Plaintiffs believe the testimony or not, surely Defendants \nat least get the opportunity to present the testimony to a jury.          \n2 Rather than attaching all 2,341 pages of strip search reports, Defendants merely attached a sampling of 30 \nfor this Court’s review and consideration.  Furthermore, Defendants’ counsel misunderstood what said \nrecords represented, as it was her understanding that the Jail merely kept records of strip search incidents \nthat were the result of unique incidents resulting in reasonable suspicion to search.  However, said clients \nhave since explained that said records are of ALL strip searches that occurred at the Jail since July 1, 2003, \nwhether covered by the policy or not.  A review of these records indicates that appears to be true, as they \nshow strip searches upon entry for drug or violent offenses, work release, suicide watch, transfer from \nanother facility, etc.  As such, Defendants intend to file a Motion to Amend their Objections to reflect \narguments that are in conformity to the evidence previously provided to Plaintiffs.     \n  3\n\nrevealed a much different story than what was told in the questionnaires.  One admitted to \na previous drug conviction; several admitted that they were a transfer from a different \nfacility (which it is Defendants’ position that those persons transferred from another \nfacility are subject to strip search); one admitted that she had attempted suicide a year \nbefore her incarceration and informed the booking officer of such (again, it is \nDefendants’ position that such persons are subject to a strip search in order to prevent a \npossible suicide in the jail).  As a result, Defendants believe that if each and every one of \nPlaintiffs’ class members were deposed and their jail files analyzed, similar facts would \ncome to light in a majority of cases.  In other words, the facts alleged by Plaintiffs to \nDefendants at the certification stage have turned out to be completely different, raising \nnumerous defenses that were not apparent after the depositions of Sutton and Turner \n(who were the only named Plaintiffs prior to this Court’s certification).   \n6.  Plaintiffs claim to have over 7,000 class members at this time (See Sur-\nReply filed by Plaintiffs, dated April 17, 2006).  This is vastly different than the 95 \nnumber that was provided just prior to class certification.  (See Plaintiffs’ Petition to \nCertify).     \n  As a result, even if the law requires Defendants to bring forth a change in law or \nfact to justify decertification, Defendants have met their burden.  Furthermore, the mere \nfact that this case has become unmanageable since certification due to the sheer numbers \nand the fact that it is apparent that each class member will need an individual \ndetermination on liability is sufficient justification for decertification.  In their Response, \nPlaintiffs attempt to argue that because Defendants signed an agreed order to \ncertification, they should be precluded from requesting decertification.  However, they \n  4\n\ncite no authority that a defendant’s agreement to class certification during an early stage \nof the proceedings bars a later challenge to certification.    \nCourts consistently hold that if unmanageability emerges as the proceedings \nunfold, the court may decertify the class under Rule 23(c)(1) at any point before final \njudgment.  See e.g., Central Wesleyan College v. W.R. Grace & Co., 6 F.3d 177, 189 (4th \nCir. 1993)(“[T]he district court must make certain that manageability and other types of \nproblems do not overwhelm the advantages of conditional certification.  Should such \nconcerns render the class mechanism ineffective, the district court must be prepared to \nuse its considerable discretion to decertify the class.”);  Chisolm v. TranSouth Financial \nCorp., 184 F.R.D. 556, 567 (E.D.Va 1999) (“Should management concerns prove \nintractable, the Court may simply decertify the class.”); In re School Asbestos Litig., 789 \nF.2d 996, 1011 (3rd Cir. 1986) (Finding that “[w]hen, and if, the district court is \nconvinced that the litigation cannot be managed, decertification is proper.”).  For these \nreasons alone, Defendants are entitled to decertification.   \nB.  Plaintiffs will not be unfairly and manifestly prejudiced by decertification. \nPlaintiffs argue that they would be unfairly prejudiced by a decertification order \nbecause (1) they have incurred substantial expense in reviewing all of Defendants’ inmate \nfiles for purposes of acquiring contact information; (2) the class members would be \nunfairly prejudiced because they have relied on this class action and therefore not come \nforward to advance their individual claims; (3) they would have been entitled to withhold \nquestionnaire responses from Defendants as work product and as attorney/client-\nprivileged communications; and (4) the Defendants have waited until eight months before \ntrial to ask for decertification.   \n  5\n\nAs to their first argument, prior to certification, Plaintiffs visited Defendants’ \nfacility and obtained the names of 1,797 individuals and mailed questionnaires to each.   \nPlaintiffs’ counsel incurred expenses with this exercise before they even knew if the class \nwould be certified.  Regardless, attorneys across this country everyday incur expenses \nthat they may not recover.  It is the nature of the practice.  Obviously, Plaintiffs’ counsel \nmay attempt to recoup expenses if a judgment or settlement occurs in the individual cases \nthat Plaintiffs’ counsel claim they will bring if decertified.  Regardless, surely Plaintiffs \nare not arguing that Defendants’ due process rights should be violated, i.e., Defendants \nshould not be entitled to present their defenses as to each and every class member, in \norder to ensure that Plaintiffs’ counsels’ expenses are recouped.   See Perez v. Metabolife \nInt., Inc., 218 F.R.D. 262 (S.D. Fl 2003). \n  As to their second argument, there is nothing to prevent the individual class \nmembers from coming forward to advance individual claims following decertification.  \nCertainly it is within the Court’s inherent power to alleviate these concerns upon \ndecertification.  Crown, Cork & Seal Co., Inc. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 354-5 (1983) \n(Holding that “the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of \nlimitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the \nsuit been permitted to continue as a class action. Once the statute of limitations has been \ntolled, it remains tolled for all members of the putative class until class certification is \ndenied. At that point, class members may choose to file their own suits or to intervene as \nplaintiffs in the pending action.”).  As such, it is of no consequence at this time that the \nclass members have not filed individual actions.   \n  Their third argument is perplexing.  Plaintiffs argue that giving Defendants copies \n  6\n\nof the questionnaires was a waiver of their attorney work product/attorney client privilege \nthat they would not have done but for the certification.  However, Plaintiffs attached 95 \ncompleted questionnaires to their Petition to Certify, which was obviously filed before \nthis Court certified this case as a class action.  As such, it appears that Plaintiffs’ counsel \nvoluntarily waived any work-product/attorney client privilege argument that they may \nhave in said questionnaires before Defendants even agreed to the certification.  Finally, if \nPlaintiffs believed the documents were privileged, they should have asserted the \nprivilege. \n  As to their fourth argument, Plaintiffs complain that Defendants waited eight \nmonths before trial to request decertification. First, it should be pointed out that \nDefendants’ Motion was filed 9 ½ months before trial, rather than eight. Second, even if \nthe class was decertified, the named Plaintiffs would have the right to proceed with the \nscheduled trial.  Furthermore, motions to decertify are typically filed following discovery, \nwhich of course is usually within just a few months of the trial date.  As explained \npreviously, the Court can decertify a class at any time prior to final judgment. See \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(C); Rodriguez v. Berrybrook Farms Inc., 672 F.Supp. 1009, 1012 \n(W.D.Mich.1987) (noting “that . . . class certification . . . is flexible . . . and . . . the \npractice of defining subclasses and of decertifying an existing class often accommodates \nthe products of discovery and even development at trial”); Barney v. Holzer Clinic, Ltd., \n110 F.3d 1207, 1214 (6 th Cir.1997).  As such, it is of no consequence that Defendants \nfiled their Motion 9 ½ months before trial.   \n  Finally, the fact that Plaintiffs now argue that they will be prejudiced if the \nMotion to Decertify is granted is ironic in light of a recent letter written by Plaintiffs’ \n  7\n\ncounsel to Defendants’ counsel.  (See Exhibit “B”, attached hereto).  In that letter, \nPlaintiffs counsel expressed surprise that Defendants were seeking to decertify this action \nand further explained how decertification could only be beneficial to their clients, since \nthey would likely be entitled to more damages.  As a result, Plaintiffs’ claims of prejudice \nare dubious at best.   \n  C.  Federal authority is not dispositive of the Defendants’ arguments. \n    1.  Eddelman v. Jefferson County is clearly distinguishable. \n  As Defendants explained in their Motion to Decertify, Eddelman is clearly \ndistinguishable for numerous reasons, the most important factor being that Eddelman \ninvolved an across-the-board strip search policy such that the defendants in that case \nwere not entitled to come forward with testimony and/or evidence to establish that each \nclass member was not strip searched.  This is a HUGE distinction.  In this case, \nDefendants’ due process rights will be violated if they are not given this opportunity, \nresulting in this class action having become unmanageable and lacking in commonality \nand typicality as is required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.   \n    Plaintiffs claim that whether there was an across-the-board strip search policy in \nEddelman had no bearing on the Sixth Circuit’s opinion.  However, the following \nlanguage quoted by the Plaintiffs in their Response clearly shows otherwise: \nDefendants argue that because the reasonableness of any search must be \nexamined on a case-by-case basis, the constitutionality of strip searches \ncannot be properly evaluated in a class action.  The basis for the complaint \narises precisely because the defendants did not conduct an individualized \nassessment of the need for each search.  Plaintiffs allege, and that \nallegation must be taken as true for our purposes here, that their \nconstitutional rights were violated by a policy or a custom, written or \nunwritten, to search every arrestee who entered the jail, regardless of the \nindividual circumstances.  Due to the single legal theory and the similar \nfacts for each plaintiff, a class action would be superior to individual \n  8\n\nactions. Id. at 5 (emphasis added).  (See p. 11 of Plaintiffs’ Response).   \n \nAs such, Plaintiffs’ arguments in this regard are clearly incorrect.  The Sixth \nCircuit determined that certification was proper in Eddelman because the defendants did \nnot make “an individualized assessment of the need for each search.”  As explained in \nDefendants’ Motion to Decertify, pursuant to Defendants’ policies, the deputy jailers \nwere required to conduct an “individualized assessment” prior to each strip search.  \nPlaintiffs argue the Court must blindly accept as true the allegations they have made in \nthis case.  However, even Plaintiffs’ own evidence, i.e., completed questionnaires, \nindicate that not all persons who were incarcerated at the Hopkins County Detention \nCenter were strip-searched.  (See 32 questionnaires provided by Plaintiffs to Defendants \nwherein the persons deny having been strip searched at the Jail, attached hereto as \nExhibit “C”).   \n           Furthermore, Defendants’ policy as to those “inmates” returning to the jail is \nirrelevant.  As Defendants’ expert witness has explained, the policy did not require a strip \nsearch of those “persons” returning from the jail that had been ordered released by the \nCourt as those persons were no longer considered “inmates”.  (Sabbatine depo., pp. 24-5, \n30, 61-3, attached hereto as Exhibit “D”). In addition, a review of the questionnaires \nattached hereto as Exhibit “B”, as well as a review of the other 720 or so questionnaires, \nclearly show that many persons deny being strip searched upon release.  (See Report \nprepared by Defendants indicating that only 337 of said 720 persons claim to have been \nstrip searched upon release, attached hereto as Exhibit “E”).      \n  Finally, Defendants argued that Eddelman is inapplicable because the PLRA was \nnot in existence at that time, requiring an individual determination as to (1) exhaustion of \n  9\n\nadministrative remedies; and (2) physical injury.  It is Defendants’ position that Plaintiffs \nare incorrect in their statement that “this Court has already held that the PLRA is \ninapplicable to this case.”  Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss this Complaint in its \nentirety, claiming that it is barred by the PLRA.  This Court entered an Order denying \nDefendants’ Motion and determining that the PLRA is inapplicable to those persons that \nwere not incarcerated at the time of the filing of Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  (See \nMemorandum Opinion and Order of December 19, 2005).  Obviously, that does not mean \nthat the PLRA is entirely inapplicable to this case.  In fact, the PLRA mandates \notherwise.  If a potential class member was incarcerated when this suit was filed, his \nclaim is barred by the PLRA.     \nTo date, Defendants have received jail records from Hopkins, Union, Henderson \nand Webster Counties for January 9, 2003.  They indicate that 63 of the 750 potential \nclass members were incarcerated on that date.  (See Exhibit “F”, attached hereto).  Of \ncourse, this process is cumbersome and next to impossible.  Unfortunately, there are \nmany county records, as well as the Department of Corrections’ records, that need to be \nobtained to ensure that persons that are not entitled to recover an award pursuant to the \nPLRA do not.  \nObviously, if this case was decertified, requiring these persons to file individual \nactions, then Defendants could conduct discovery as to each to determine their status as \nof January 9, 2003.  Unfortunately, in the class action case of Fischer v. Wolfinbarger, \nthe U.S. District Court in Louisville concluded that “interrogatories are improper, \ndirected as they are to members of the class who are not named plaintiffs.”  55 F.R.D. \n129, 132 (W.D. Ky. 1971).  “It is not intended that members of the class should be treated \n  10\n\nas if they were parties plaintiff, subject to the normal discovery procedures, because if \nthat were permitted, then the reason for [Rule 12(a)] would fail.”  Id.  As such, unless this \naction is decertified, Defendants are precluded from engaging in discovery to determine \neach member’s status as of the filing of the Complaint.  Obviously, the Defendants in  \nEddelman did not have to worry about the incarceration status of each class member, as \nthe PLRA had not been enacted at that time.  Clearly, Eddelman is inapplicable and \nshould not be used by Plaintiffs to justify and/or defend certification. \n2.  Plaintiffs have not satisfied Commonality and Adequacy of \nRepresentation elements of Rule 23(a).             \n \n  Again, Plaintiffs rely on Eddelman to support their theory that they meet the \ncommonality and adequacy of representation requirements because the Court in \nEddelman determined that the Plaintiffs in that case met the commonality requirement.  \nDefendants reiterate what has previously been argued --- the fact that the Defendants in \nthis case had a policy that required an “individual assessment” before a strip search could \ntake place distinguishes Eddelman and easily defeats Plaintiffs’ commonality argument.  \nBefore an inmate was strip searched at Hopkins County Detention Center, the deputy \njailer was required to consider numerous factors.3  This key element was not present in \nEddelman \n  Plaintiffs also argue that they meet the commonality requirement because “the \nevidence adduced in discovery thus far supports --- that Defendants had a policy, custom \nand practice of strip-searching persons . . . without regard to whether there existed the \n                                                 \n3 In footnote 4, Plaintiffs state that “Defendant Lantrip has already testified that the jail did not take into \naccount an arrestee’s criminal background in deciding whether to strip search.”  This argument is made in \nthe face of the exhibit that they attach which clearly shows that Lantrip testified that they may not have had \na print out of the state’s “criminal history” at the time of booking but they had access to the Jail’s records \nwhich showed what the person had been previously arrested for in Hopkins County, as well as any previous \ncriminal charges provided by the inmate to the booking officer upon questioning.  (See Exhibit “E” to \nPlaintiffs’ Response, pp. 14-16).      \n  11\n\nrequisite, individualized reasonable suspicion required by law.”  However, only 10 per \ncent of those contacted by Plaintiffs thus far have responded to the questionnaire \nclaiming they were strip searched.  This does not mean that those persons were subject to \nan unlawful strip search.  At least 32 so far have returned questionnaires claiming that \nthey were not subjected to a strip search at all.  (See Exhibit “C”).  Furthermore, as \nexplained in the Motion to Decertify, 247 of those questionnaires fail to state a claim on \ntheir face.  In reviewing the inmate files, thus far, nearly two-thirds indicate reasonable \nsuspicion.  And finally, at least 61 of those potential class members are barred by the \nPLRA.  So Plaintiffs’ numbers are not what they would like this Court to think.  \nRegardless, whether there was a practice or custom of strip searching inmates at the jail is \na question for the jury.  In other words, the Plaintiffs should not be allowed to foreclose \nthe Defendants from presenting evidence that a strip search did not occur as to each class \nmember by relying on an issue that is yet to be determined by the jury.   \n3.  Plaintiffs have not satisfied the predominance and superiority \nrequirements of Rule 23.      \n \n  Again, Plaintiffs rely on Eddelman to support their theory that they have met the \nsuperiority and predominance requirements.  For the same reasons stated previously, \nEddelman is inapplicable.  If this case was to proceed to trial, this Court would be \nrequired to hold mini-trials on each and every claim.  Clearly, this case has become \nunmanageable and Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of establishing that \nindividual determinations will not predominate over the common issues.  Furthermore, \ndue to the unmanageability of this action, Plaintiffs have failed to meet the superiority \nrequirement.  In Eddelman because everyone was strip-searched, a fact determination as \nto whether the person was even strip-searched was not necessary.  Clearly, this fact \n  12\n\ndetermination is necessary in this case.     \n4.  The authorities cited by Plaintiffs are distinguishable. \nDefendants have provided this Court with two cases identical to the incident case \nwherein the District Judge in those cases determined that a class action was not \nappropriate.  Bledsoe v. Combs, 2000 WL 681094 (S.D. Ind. 2000); Noon v. Sailor, 2000 \nWL 684274 (S.D. Ind. 2000).  Plaintiffs fail to distinguish those cases but merely claim \nthat because they are unpublished this Court should not consider them.  However, as will \nbe illustrated, Bledsoe and Noon are the only cases that Defendants and apparently even \nPlaintiffs can find with facts similar to those in this case. \nPlaintiffs provide a string-cite of 20 cases which they claim is “the weight of \nfederal precedent favoring the certification of strip-search class actions.”  Defendants do \nnot question that a class action is appropriate in certain strip search cases.  Defendants \nclaim that it is not appropriate when there is no across-the-board policy mandating strip \nsearches such that individual assessments must occur.  Here are Plaintiffs’ cited cases \nwith the distinguishing characteristics: \nTardiff v. Knox County4  involved classes certified to contain only those who \nwere searched without evaluation for individualized suspicion.  Id. at 3.  Importantly, the \ncourt noted that if it were necessary to conduct an individual analysis in many of the \nsearches as to whether a defendant’s evaluation revealed reasonable suspicion for the \nsearch, such individualization of issues might compromise the feasibility of a class \naction, thereby leading to its doom.  Id. at 5-6.   \n  Gary v. Sheahan5 only addresses the proper procedure for a party to follow in \n                                                 \n4 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004). \n5 188 F.3d 891 (7th Cir. 1999). \n  13\n\norder to appeal from a district court’s denial of its motion to decertify a class.   \n  McDonell v. Hunter 6 was a 23(b)(2) (not (b)(3)) class action brought by Iowa \nDepartment of Corrections employees seeking injunctive relief from an across-the-board \npolicy of  defendants which subjected them to strip-searches, urinalysis and vehicle \nsearches.   \n  Bell v. Manson 7 was also a 23(b)(2) (not (b)(3)) class action seeking injunctive \nand declaratory relief which was brought by pretrial detainees who were subjected to \nstrip-searches after their return from court appearances pursuant to an across-the-board \npolicy.  It is important to note that 23(b)(2) class actions do not require the Plaintiffs to \nprove predominance and superiority.   \n  Bynum v. District of Columbia 8 merely represents the district court’s final order \nof approval of settlement of a class action brought by past, present and future detainees in \nthe District of Columbia Department of Corrections challenging the department’s policy \nof conducting suspicionless strip-searches of inmates declared releasable after court \nappearances.   Bynum contains no analysis as to the propriety of class certification.  \nHowever, a fair reading of that opinion indicates that the policy being challenged was one \nof conducting across-the-board, suspicionless strip-searches of those entitled to release.   \n  Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 9 was a strip-search class action brought by \ninmates challenging the across-the-board policy of defendant to automatically strip-\nsearch, without reasonable suspicion, all arrestees remanded to the sheriff on any warrant \nand all inmates returning from court appearances, including those ordered released. \n                                                 \n6 809 F.2d 1302 (8th Cir. 1986).  \n7590 F.2d 1224 (2nd Cir. 1978).  \n8 412 F.Supp.2d 73 (D.D.C. 2006). \n9 405 F.Supp.2d 933 (N.D. Ill. 2005). \n  14\n\nFurther, the case deals exclusively with the legal analysis as to the constitutionality of the \nsearches and does not touch upon the procedural propriety of certifying such cases as \nclass actions.   \n  Nilsen v. York County, 10 deals exclusively with the court’s analysis of the proper \nmethod of allocating attorney’s fees in a strip-search class action.  As such, said opinion \nis devoid of any analysis as to the procedural propriety of maintaining said actions on a \nclass basis.   \n  McBean v. City of New York, 11 was a class action brought by pretrial detainees \nchallenging an across-the-board policy of conducting strip-searches of every detainee \nnewly admitted to its facilities.  The court upheld the certification and noted that \n“plaintiffs in this action are unified by a common legal theory (DOC’s blanket policy \nsubjecting all post-arraignment misdemeanor arrestees to intake strip-searches was \nunconstitutional) and by common facts (each was allegedly subjected to one or more strip \nsearches in accordance with this policy).”  Id. at 502.   The court then addressed the \nsuperiority requirement by providing that “[a] class action is also the most efficient and \nsuperior means through which to resolve these claims, where the class size is estimated at \nover 55,000 individuals.” Id. at 503.   \n  Marriott v. County of Montgomery 12 was a class action brought by detainees \nchallenging the constitutionality of the defendants’ across-the-board “change-out” policy \nwhich required all new admittees to be strip searched.  The Court determined that the \nonly questions of fact that differed “among the members of the class relate to the extent \nof the search to which each individual was subjected, which would affect the amount of \n                                                 \n10 400 F.Supp.2d 266 (D. Me. 2005).  \n11 228 F.R.D. 487 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).  \n12 227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y. 2005). \n  15\n\ncompensatory damages.”  Id. at 173 (emphasis added).   \n  Dodge v. City of Orange 13 is an inmate strip-search class action challenging the \nconstitutionality of an alleged across-the-board strip-searching policy.  In that case, the \nplaintiffs alleged that “everyone was searched pursuant to a uniformly-applied policy.  \nImplicit in that allegation is the notion that no individualized assessments were made for \nanyone.” Id.  \n  Bullock v. Sheahan 14 was an inmate strip-search case brought in response to an \nalleged policy of defendants’ strip-searching all male inmates without reasonable \nsuspicion prior to their release and that such differing treatment of male inmates violated \ntheir constitutional rights.   \n  Smook v. Minnehaha County 15 was a class action brought by former detainees at \na county juvenile detention center challenging the constitutionality of the center’s policy \nof conducting strip-searches of all minors upon their admission regardless of the type of \noffense they were arrested for or whether there was reason to believe that the minors had \nweapons or contraband.    \n  Williams v. Brown 16 was a class action but it was not brought by inmates and \nwas not dealing with strip-searches.  Rather, plaintiffs were detained by police and \nsearched while they attended a neighborhood basketball tournament. The court declined \nto follow the ruling of an inmate strip-search case submitted by defendants for the reason \nthat such a case is too dissimilar to the one at bar.  \n                                                 \n13 226 F.R.D. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).  \n14 225 F.R.D. 227 (N.D. Ill. 2004).  \n15 340 F.Supp.2d 1037 (D.S.D. 2004).  \n16 214 F.R.D. 484 (N.D. Ill. 2003). \n  16\n\n  Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wisconsin17 dealt with an across-the-board policy.  \nPlaintiffs brought the case alleging to have been subjected to unconstitutional strip \nsearches conducted by defendants pursuant to a policy to strip-search all arrestees at the \njail without individualized suspicion.  Id. at 613.   \n  Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 18 was an inmate strip-search class action \nchallenging the constitutionality of defendants’ policy requiring the systematic strip \nsearch of all persons being held awaiting arraignment.  Defendants did not distinguish \nbetween persons charged with lesser offenses, nor did it require officers to consider \nwhether there was reasonable suspicion to believe that a particular detainee was carrying \na weapon or contraband.  \n  Ford v. City of Boston 19 involved an express policy of the City of Boston to \ntransfer all female arrestees who could not post bail to Suffolk County’s maximum \nsecurity jail, which had a policy of subjecting all of these jail admittees, to strip and \nvisual body cavity searches regardless of the crimes with which they are charged, or any \nother individual factors.   \n  Mack v. Suffolk County 20 was another class action challenging the \nconstitutionality of the above practices of the City of Boston and the County of Suffolk.  \nHere, suit was brought again challenging the uniform strip-search policy of the Suffolk \nCounty Sheriff’s Department whereby City pre-arraignment detainees transferred to \nSuffolk County were subjected to a visual body and cavity search as a matter of course \nupon their admission.   \n                                                 \n17 219 F.R.D. 607 (W.D.Wis. 2003). \n18  208 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).  \n19 154 F.Supp.2d 131 (D. Mass. 2001). \n20 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000).  \n  17\n\n  Hurley v. Coughlin 21 is not relevant to this case as it involved a class of inmates, \nprotected by a previously entered consent decree regarding strip search practices, who \nwere attempting to obtain various forms of relief due to defendant’s failure to follow the \nconsent decree.   \n  Johns v. DeLeonardis22 involved a class of gypsies who brought suit against \npolice officers who interrupted a meeting of the Chicago Gypsie Council and, without a \nwarrant or any explanation as to their reasons, subjected all present to various searches of \ntheir persons, including strip-searches in some instances.  In the course of granting \nplaintiffs’ motion to maintain the class, the court provided that “there can be no doubt \nthat a common core of operative facts gave rise to common legal questions in the \nplaintiffs’ claims.  All the alleged injury arose from a single occurrence, the raid and \nsubsequent conduct of the defendants at the …meeting.  The question of whether the raid \nviolated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs is the sole issue presented by this case.”  \nId. at 483.   \n  Doe v. Calumet City, Illinois 23 involves a class action brought by female \narrestees challenging the city police department’s unwritten practice of consistently \nimposing indiscriminate strip-searches of female arrestees.  The testimony of those \nconducting the searches revealed that neither they, nor any other officers were required to \nmake any reasonable suspicion determination before conducting a strip search, except in \nthe case of male arrestees.  In addition, no inquiry or analysis was conducted as to why \nthe facts of this case rendered it proper for class certification.   \n                                                 \n21 158 F.R.D. 22 (S.D.N.Y. 1993).  \n22 145 F.R.D. 480 (N.D. Ill. 1992). \n23 754 F.Supp. 1211 (N.D. Ill. 1990). \n  18\n\n  Smith v. Montgomery County, Maryland 24 was a class action brought to \nchallenge the constitutionality of defendants’ indiscriminate, across-the-board strip-\nsearch policy.  \n  Hodges v. Klein 25 was a 23(b)(2) (rather than 23(b)(3)) class action in which a \nclass of inmates requested the Court to enjoin the Defendant from conducting anal \nexaminations of certain inmates.  It is distinguishable because it is a 23(b)(2) case, which \ndoes not require predominance and superiority.  Furthermore, there exists no discussion \nor analysis as to the procedural propriety of this issue being determined on a class basis.  \nClearly, Plaintiffs have failed to bring forth even one case that is similar to this \naction to support their theory that a class action should be maintained.  In contrast, \nDefendants have presented this Court with two nearly identical cases (albeit unpublished) \nwherein the Court determined that class actions were not appropriate.  Defendants are \nclearly entitled to decertification.   \nD.  Plaintiffs’ are not entitled to an irrebuttable presumption that all persons \nincarcerated at the Hopkins County Detention Center were subjected to a \nstrip search.  \n \n  Plaintiffs argue that “Defendants cannot credibly refute Plaintiffs’ claims that the \nJail had a practice of strip-searching persons on admission to or just prior to their release \nfrom the Jail without reasonable suspicion.”  First, as explained previously, even \nPlaintiffs’ own evidence indicates that 32 persons, at this time, deny having been strip \nsearched at all, much less without reasonable suspicion.   \nSecond, Defendants offer an Affidavit of Donald Corum to rebut Plaintiffs’ \nargument that this Court should assume that everyone that was contacted by Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n24 573 F.Supp. 604 (D.Md. 1983).  \n25 412 F.Supp. 896 (D. N.J. 1976).  \n  19\n\n(approximately 7,000) were strip searched.  (See Affidavit of Donald Corum, attached \nhereto as Exhibit “G”).  Donald Corum has received two notices and questionnaires \nconcerning this suit.  The most recent notice and questionnaire were received last week \nand are attached to Mr. Corum’s Affidavit.  After he received this second notice and \nquestionnaire, Mr. Corum contacted the Defendants questioning why he was receiving \nsaid notice since he was not strip searched at the Jail during his incarceration.  He has not \nreturned the questionnaire to Plaintiffs’ counsel telling them that he was not strip \nsearched because he “doesn’t want any part of this case.”  (Id.).  The question is:  How \nmany more people have been contacted by the Plaintiffs but have not responded merely \nbecause the “don’t want any part of this case.”?  The point is:  The Jail clearly did not \nstrip search everyone that was incarcerated at the Jail.   \nThird, as shown by example in Defendants’ Motion to Decertify, many of those \nwho claim to have been strip searched were done so with reasonable suspicion.  And if \nthe percentages play out, nearly two-thirds of those that claim to have been strip searched \ncan be rebutted with evidence in the Jail’s files (that does not include those that may be \nrebutted by looking at the person’s criminal file or speaking with the deputy jailer who \nmay have an independent memory).   \nFinally, the Defendants ask this Court to consider Plaintiffs’ letter that \naccompanied the questionnaire received by Mr. Corum.26  It is on Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \nletterhead, rather than in the format approved by this Court.  In addition, the court-\napproved language has been changed.  Of significance is the fact that Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel changed the definition of a strip search.  In the letter, a strip search is defined \nas “a search in which you were required to remove all or part of your clothing by a jail \n                                                 \n26 Defendants only learned last week of this letter, sent by Plaintiffs’ counsel without leave of Court.  \n  20\n\nofficer so that he/she could conduct a visual examination of all or part of your body.”  \nObviously, this is not the legal definition for a strip search.  Under this definition, merely \nshowing your leg or arm would be a strip search.  The Court-approved definition of strip \nsearch is contained on the questionnaire, which provides that “the term ‘strip-search,’ as \nused in the question above, means that you were required by the jail to remove all or part \nof your clothing so that men’s buttocks or genitalia, or women’s buttocks, genitalia or \nbreasts, were visible to one or more jail employees.”  So how many of those persons \nresponding to Plaintiffs’ letter and completing the questionnaire are under the impression \nthat they were “strip searched” as that term is defined in Plaintiffs’ counsel’s letter?  In \nfact, Mr. Corum states in his Affidavit that he believes the letter was “misleading”.  \nClearly, this does nothing but bolster Defendants’ claim that each of these people should \nbe subjected to discovery and that Defendants should be allowed to bring forth evidence \nthat each one of these people were not strip searched, i.e., resulting in this case having \nbecome unmanageable.   \n  Plaintiffs go on to argue that Defendants should be precluded from bringing forth \nthis evidence because they failed to keep records of strip-searches as is required by 501 \nKAR 3:120 and the Jail’s policy.  The cases cited by Plaintiffs involved the Defendant’s \nfailure to retain existing records, not defendant’s failure to create a record.  There has \nbeen no spoliation of evidence in this case because the allegedly spoiliated evidence \nnever existed.  Moreover, as explained previously, beginning on and since July 1, 2003, \nDefendants have kept records of all persons strip-searched at the Hopkins County \nDetention Center. Since that date, the deputy jailers have maintained records of the \nnames of all inmates that have been strip-searched, the reason for strip search, the date of \n  21\n\nstrip search, and the name of the strip searching officer.  Plaintiffs have copies of these \nreports in their possession.  So Defendants are not in violation of the Kentucky \nAdministrative Regulations, nor their policies, as Plaintiffs allege, and therefore would \nnot be subject to a jury instruction pursuant to the doctrine of spoliation.   \nAs such, Plaintiffs’ argument that Defendants should be prevented from \npresenting evidence that persons were not strip searched is without merit.  Not only will \nDefendants be able to present testimony of the booking officers, they will also be able to \npresent the Jail’s records that fail to show a strip search, or if the record indicates a strip \nsearch, said records will set forth the reasonable suspicion for said search.  Regardless, \nthis will require a trial on the merits as to each persons’ unlawful strip search claim, again \nresulting in a lack of commonality, superiority, predominance, and manageability.   \n  E.  The practical considerations of this Motion do not mandate certification. \n  In the last section of their Response, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants cannot \nafford the litigation of hundreds or thousands of individual actions.  Defendants’ Motion \nfor Decertification and Reply should make it clear to this Court that if this action is \ndecertified, it is doubtful that there will be 750 claims since many of those fail to even \nstate a claim on their face.  Further, Plaintiffs’ counsel will be governed by Fed. R. Civ. \nR. 11, requiring them to conduct some sort of investigation before the claims are filed, \nwhich will likely result in far fewer cases than Plaintiffs predict, since Defendants’ \ncounsel’s investigation of these claims show reasonable suspicion in two-thirds of those \ncases reviewed.27   \n                                                 \n27 One has to assume that such is the case in nearly all class actions because every case reviewed by \nDefendants’ counsel shows the defendants opposing certification and the plaintiffs requesting it.  If it is as \nPlaintiffs’ suggest, i.e., that individual actions will cost the Defendants more than a class action, then the \ndefendants should always want class certification, with plaintiffs opposing it.  In other words, Defendants \n  22\n\n  If this action is decertified, this Court’s job will be much easier as it is hoped that \nonly credible claims will be brought forth following decertification.  Furthermore, \nDefendants will be allowed to engage in discovery as to each of those “credible” claims, \nfor purposes of gathering evidence of reasonable suspicion and evidence to support \nPLRA defenses.  Thereafter, Defendants would be entitled to file Motions for Summary \nJudgment, many of which will be granted, resulting in far fewer trials.  Finally, those \ncases surviving summary judgment could be consolidated by this Court, if necessary, \npreventing hundreds of individual trials, as Plaintiffs claim. \nAt present, Plaintiffs claim approximately 720 unlawful strip searches, many of \nwhich are not even credible on their face; Defendants are prohibited from engaging in \ndiscovery as to these claims, resulting in less credible summary judgment motions \n(assuming one can even be filed against class members as opposed to parties).  \nFurthermore, in order to protect Defendants’ due process rights, if not decertified, this \nCourt must allow Defendants an opportunity to bring forth evidence as to each claim, \nresulting in jury trials as to all class members.  As such, Defendants’ argument makes \nsense both procedurally and economically.   \n    WHEREFORE, defendants, Hopkins County, Kentucky and Jim Lantrip, in his \nindividual and official capacities, request that their Motion to Decertify by granted.  \n             \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                 \ndo not buy Plaintiffs’ argument that they merely oppose this Motion to protect Defendants’ financial \ncondition.   \n  23\n\n            Respectfully submitted, \nDENTON & KEULER \nP.O.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY\nOWENSBORO DIVISION\nCIVIL ACTION NO: 4:03CV-003-M\nEDWARD LEE SUTTON, LESTER H. TURNER,\nLINDA JOYCE FORD, TIMOTHY D. MAY,\nLADONIA W. WILSON, ROBIN LITTLEPAGE, \nROBERT R. TEAGUE, and TABITHA NANCE\nIndividually and on behalf of all other similarly situated PLAINTIFFS\nV.\nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY and\nJIM LANTRIP, Individually and in his official\ncapacity as Jailer of Hopkins County, Kentucky                DEFENDANTS\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nThis matter is before the Court upon a motion by Chyrle Taylor for a declaration of rights,\nto intervene, and to hold in abeyance [DN 474] and on a m otion by Chyrle Taylor for equitable\nrelief, for relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), or, in the alternative, to reopen [DN 484].  Fully\nbriefed, this matter is ripe for decision. \nOn July 11, 2008, the parties reached a settlement agreement in this case.  On August 25,\n2008, the claims administrator, Analytics, Inc., mailed potential class members, including Chyrle\nTaylor, a Notice of Hearing and Proposed Class Action Settlement and Claim Form via first-class\nmail at her current residence [See DN 425].  The notice informed potential class members of the\nOctober 20, 2008, Fairness Hearing and of the  December 31, 2008, deadline for filing of claim\nforms.  On October 20, 2008, the Court approved thes ettlement agreement.  Jonathan Reid, Project\nManager for Analytics, Inc., testified that records of the claims administrator indicate that the notice\nsent to Taylor was not returned as undelivered and that Analytics did not receive a claim form from\nTaylor.  (Jonathan Reid Affidavit at ¶ 1-3.) \n\nOn August 19, 2009, Taylor, through counsel, filed two motions essentially challenging the\nclass notification procedure utilized by the Court and requesting an extension of time to submit a\nclaim.  Taylor represents that she has filed ou tnumerous forms since June of 2005, attended a claim\nmeeting in May of 2007, received correspondence in this matter, was deposed on August 15, 2007,\nand repeatedly called the office of class counsel to check on the status of her claim during 2008.\nAccording to Taylor, she spoke personally with Mr. Belzley on Septem ber 26, 2008, and was\ninformed that the case was settled and that sh e “would be getting [ her] money ‘sometime next\nyear.’” Taylor represents that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing and Proposed Class Action\nSettlement and Claim Form mailed by Analytics in August of 2008.  Taylor states that she called\nclass counsel on August 12, 2009, to check on the status of the case and was informed that she was\nnot entitled to payment because she hadn’t completed a claim form. (Taylor Affidavit at ¶ 14.) \nA.  Notice    \nTaylor maintains that the notice of the settlement provided to the class members violated the\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and the Due Process Clause.  “Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(e)(1), a district court, when approving a class action settlement, ‘must direct notice\nin a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.’” Fidel v. Farley,\n534 F.3d 508, 513 (6th Cir. 2008).  \nAdditionally, “[f]or any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court must direct to\nclass members the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances, including\nindividual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B). The Due Prcoess Clause, moreover, gives unnamed class\nmembers the right to notice of  the settlement of a class action. [DeJulius v. New\nEngland Health Care Employees Pension Fund, 429 F.3d 935, 943-44 (10th Cir.\n2005)] (citing Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313, 70\nS.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)); Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 173,\n94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974). To com port with the requirements of due\nprocess,  notice m ust  be “reasonably calculated to reach interested par ties.”\n2\n\nKarkoukli’s, Inc. v. Dohany, 409 F.3d 279, 283 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Mullane,\n339 U.S. at 318-20, 70 S.Ct. 652); see also DeJulius, 429 F.3d at 944. Due process\ndoes not, however, require actual notice to each party intended to be bound by the\nadjudication of a representative action. DeJulius, 429 F.3d at 944 (citing Mullane,\n339 U.S. at 313-14, 70 S.Ct. 652); In re Integra Realty Res., Inc., 262 F.3d 1089,\n1110-11 (10th Cir. 2001); Silber v. Mabon, 18 F.3d 1449, 1453-54 (9th Cir.1994).\nFidel, 534 F.3d at 513-514.\nOn October 20, 2008, the Court approved the settlement agreement between the parties and\ndirected that potential class members be informed of the settlement and afforded the opportunity to\nmake claims against the settlement fund.  Thereafter, 3,437 individual notices of settlement and\nproof of claim forms were mailed to potential classm  embers via first-class mail.  The Court directed\nthat notice be published in no less than 11 newspape rs of general circulation providing potential\nclass members with contact information from which they could obtain a proof of claim form.  The\nclaims administrator also set up a website from which class members could download and print off\nproof of claim forms.  \nThe Court finds that the notice process approved by the Court was adequate under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23 and the standards of due process because it was directed in a reasonable manner to all\nprospective class members who would be bound by theS ettlement Agreement.  Contrary to Taylor’s\nargument, there is no requirement in the rules or case law that such notices be sent certified mail or\nbe made by telephoning all class m embers. “[N]otice by first class mail ordinarily satisfies rule\n23(c)(2)’s  requirement  that class m embers  receive ‘the best notice practicable under the\ncircumstances.’” Peters v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 966 F.2d 1483, 1486 (D.C. Cir. 1992);\nUAW v. General Motors Corp. , 2006 WL 891151, 34 (E.D. Mi ch. 2006);  Johnson v. GMAC\nMortgage Group, Inc., 2006 WL 2433474, *4 (N.D. Iowa 2006) (first class mail to class members’\nlast known addresses satisfies notice requirement); In re VMS Ltd. Partnership Securities Litigation,\n3\n\n1995 WL 355722 (N.D. Ill. 1995).  Accordingly, the Court rejects Tayl or’s challenge to the\nsufficiency of notice of the class settlement.    \nB.  Excusable Neglect\nPursuant to Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Assoc. Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S.\n380 (1993), Taylor requests an enlargement of time in which to file a late claim and participate in\nthe settlement.  Additionally, Taylor submits that there should be no need for her to file a claim form\nsince all the necessary proof regarding the substance of her claim is in the record.  Accordingly,\nTaylor argues that the Court should accept her status as a class member and grant her the award set\nforth in the settlement agreement.\n“The Court has general equitable power to modify the terms of a class action settlement.”\nIn re Cendant Corp. Prides Litigation, 189 F.R.D. 321, 323 (D.N.J. 1999).  “A Court may assert this\npower to allow late-filed proofs of claim and late-cured proofs of claim.”  Id.  (citing In re Agent\nOrange Product Liability Litig., 689 F. Supp. 1250, 1263 (E.D.N.Y. 1988); The Manual For\nComplex Litig. § 30.47 at 248 (3d ed.1995) (“Adequa te time should be allowed for late claim s\nbefore any refund or other disposition of settlement fund occurs.”)); Grace v. City of Detroit, 145\nF.R.D. 413, 415 (E.D. Mich. 1992) (“The adoption  of the good cause standard [to a decision to\naccept untimely claim forms] is ‘an appropriate exercise of the trial court’s discretion in defining\nthe scope of the class action judgment and settlement.’”) (quoting Kyriazi v. Western Elec. Co., 647\nF.2d 388, 396 (3d Cir. 1981)). Courts considering requsets to extend deadlines for filing claim forms\nin class actions frequently analyze these late claims “under the rubric of whether the claimant has\nshown ‘excusable neglect.’” In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation, 246 F.3d\n315, 321 (3d Cir. 2001)(citing In reC endant Corp. Prides Litig., 189 F.R.D. 321, 324 (D.N.J. 1999)).\n4\n\nSee also Pioneer Inv. Services Co. v. Brunswick Assoc. Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S. 380 (1993); In\nre Cendant Corp. PRIDES Litig., 235 F.3d 176, 180 (3d Cir. 2000); Silvercreek Management, Inc.\nv. Banc of America Securities, LLC, 534 F.3d 469, 472 (5th Cir. 2008). In determining whether a\nclaimant should have the benefit of excusable neglect the Court should examine the following four\nfactors: “1) the danger of prejudice to the nonmovant; 2) the length of the delay and its potential\neffect on judicial proceedings; 3) the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the\nreasonable control of the movant; and 4) whether the movant acted in good faith.”  In re Orthopedic\nBone Screw Products Liability Litigation, 246 F.3d at 322-323 (citing Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395.).\nBased upon a review of the record and after conidsering the factors set forth above, the Court\nconcludes that Taylor’s actions constitute excu sable neglect.  The Court f inds that under the\ncircumstances articulated by Taylor and verified by class counsel Taylor adequately pursued her\nclaim against the Defendants.   Defendants cannot prove harm  given that the original lim it of\nDefendants’ financial obligation has not been expanded.  Similarly, the Court finds that the eight\nmonth delay will not unnecessarily prolong thees proceedings.  The claims administrator is currently\nreviewing one claim and the case has not been closed.  Further, Taylor represents to the Court that\nshe  did not receive the notice in question and had not m oved  from  her original address.\nAdditionally, the record reflects that Taylor com municated with class counsel on at least one\noccasion and called the class action hotline on numerous occasions in 2008.  Class counsel verified\nthat Taylor had spoken with him in September of 2008.  In the present litigation, Taylor filled out\nthe initial claim forms and submitted to a deposition regarding her strip search claim.  The Court\nfinds that Taylor adequately pursued her claim in good faith.  Accordingly, after a review of the\nabove factors, the Court will permit Taylor to submit a claim form to the claims administrator in\n5\n\naccordance procedures set forth in the Settlem ent Agreement.  However, the Court declines to\ndecide whether Taylor qualifies as a member of the class at this time.  Instead, the parties shall\nadhere to the claims approval and appeal processs et forth in the Settlement Agreement executed on\nJuly 11, 2008.  (Settlement Agreement ¶¶ 18, 20-23.)  \nFor these reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion by Chyrle Taylor for a\ndeclaration of rights, to intervene, a nd to hold in abeyance [DN 474] and the m otion by Chyrle\nTaylor for equitable relief, for relie f pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), or, in the alternative, to\nreopen [DN 484] is granted in part and denied in part.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no\nlater than October 23, 2009 , claimant, Chyrle Taylor, shall file a claim  form with the Claims\nAdministrator.    \ncc: counsel of record\n      Thresa Hinton, counsel for Chyrle Taylor\n      \n6",

TURNER, \nLINDA JOYCE FORD, TIMOTHY D. MAY, \nLADONIA W. NELSON, ROBIN LITTLEPAGE, \nROBERT R. TEAGUE, and TABITHA NANCE \nINDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS \nSIMILARLY SITUATED  PLAINTIFFS \nv. \nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY \nAND \nJIM LANTRIP INDIVIDUALLY AND \nIN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS JAILER \nOF HOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY  DEFENDANTS \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \nI.  Introduction \n1.  Plaintiffs Edward Lee Sutton, Lester H. Turner, Linda Joyce Ford, Timothy D. \nMay, Ladonia W. Nelson, Robin Littlepage, Robert Teague, and Tabitha Nance file this action \nindividually  and  on  behalf  of  all  persons  subjected  to  unconstitutional  strip-searches  on \nadmission and/or release from the Hopkins County Jail from January 9, 2002, to the present. \n2.  Edward Lee  Sutton,  Lester H.  Turner,  Ladonia W.  Nelson,  Robin Littlepage, \nRobert R. Teague, and Tabitha Nance file this action in their individual capacity and on behalf of \nall persons arrested for minor offenses who were required by Defendants in the Hopkins County \nJail (\"Jail\"), after becoming entitled to release, to remove their clothing for a visual inspection \ndespite the absence of any reasonable grounds for doing so (\"the Release Class\").  This class of \n\n------------------------------------------ -\nindividuals includes individuals who were strip searched just prior to their release from the Jail \nafter they were ordered released on their own recognizance; individuals who were strip searched \njust prior to release from the Jail after they were ordered released on bond and subsequent to \nposting of bond; and individuals who were strip searched just prior to their release from the Jail \nfor any other reason without reasonable grounds for doing so.  This subclass of people includes \nall individuals who were so treated from January 9,2002 to the present. \n3.  Linda  Joyce  Ford,  Timothy  D.  May,  Ladonia  W.  Nelson,  Robin  Littlepage, \nRobert R. Teague, and Tabitha Nance file this action in their individual capacity and on behalf of \nall persons arrested for non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor offenses who were required \nby Defendants in the Jail to remove their clothing for a visual inspection on admission to the Jail \ndespite the absence of any reasonable suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons \nor contraband. This subclass of people includes all individuals who were so treated from January \n9,2002 to the present. \n4.  Such searches have been and continue to be regularly conducted by Defendants \nand there are hundreds of members of each subclass.  There are questions of law and fact in this \ncase that are common to all members of each subclass.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of \ntheir  respective  subclass,  and  they  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests  of such \nsubclasses. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n5.  Plaintiffs, and all others similarly situated, seek actual and punitive damages from \nDefendants under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.c. § 1983, for gross and unconscionable \nviolations of the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed them by the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, \nNinth and  Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.  Accordingly, this \n\nCourt has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.c. §§1331  and 1343. \nPlaintiffs and the other members of their class also seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well \nas  damages under the pendent jurisdiction of this Court for negligence, gross negligence and \nintentional infliction of emotional distress.  As Hopkins County, Kentucky, is the residence of all \ndefendant parties to this action and the location of all acts pertinent to this suit, venue is proper in \nthis Court. \nIII.  Class Action \n6.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(l), (2) and (3) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are two subclasses before the Court. \n7.  The first subclass consists of all individuals arrested for minor offenses who were \nrequired to remove their clothing for a visual inspection on admission to the Jail despite the \nabsence  of  any  reasonable  suspicion  that  they  were  carrying  or  concealing  weapons  or \ncontraband. \n8.  The second subclass consists of all persons who were required by Defendants in \nthe Jail, just after becoming entitled to  release,  to remove  all  of their clothing for  a visual \ninspection despite the absence of any reasonable grounds for doing so. \n9.  Plaintiffs  will fairly  and adequately protect the interests of all class members. \nThey are  members  of the  subclasses  and their claims  are  typical  of the claims of all  class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs are offended at the treatment accorded them and the class members and will \naggressively pursue the interests of the entire class.  Plaintiffs' interest in obtaining injunctive \nrelief and  actual  and  punitive  damages  for  the  violations  of their constitutional  rights  and \nprivileges  are consistent with and not antagonistic of those of any other person within  their \nsubclass. \n\n10.  Given the circumstances of their search, as detailed below, Plaintiffs allege, on \ninformation  and belief,  that Defendants  regularly require  all  persons  arrested for nonviolent \nminor offenses to remove their clothing for a visual inspection of their bodies on admission to \nthe jail and all inmates after their return from Court appearances and prior to their release from \nthe Hopkins County Jail, even though (a) there exists no reasonable grounds for doing so, and (b) \nsuch persons have been ordered released.  Such searches violate the Fourth, Fifth, Eight, Ninth, \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Bell v. \nWolfish,  441  U.S.  520 (1979) and the  clearly established law of this circuit,  as  set forth  in \nMasters v.  Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.), cert denied, 493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503 (1989). \nThe only question that remains to be resolved is whether Plaintiffs and the members of the class \nare entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, or to  an award of compensatory and punitive \ndamages and, if so, the extent of such an award. \n11.  A class action is  superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy because: \n(a)  A  multiplicity  of  suits  with  consequent  burden  on  the \ncourts and Defendants should be avoided. \n(b)  It would be virtually impossible for all class members to \nintervene as parties-plaintiff in this action. \n(c)  Upon adjudication of Defendants'  liability, claims  of the \nclass members can be determined by this Court. \nIV.  Parties \n12.  Plaintiffs  are  residents  of  various  counties  within  the  Commonwealth  of \nKentucky. \n13.  Defendant  Hopkins  County,  at  all  times  mentioned  herein,  employed,  was \nresponsible  for  the  establishment  of  policies  either  formally  or  by  custom  for,  and  was \n\nresponsible for the employment, training, supervision and conduct of, the officers and employees \nof the Hopkins County Jail. \n14.  Defendant  Jim Lantrip  is  Jailer of Hopkins  County,  and  as  such  established \npolicies  formally  or  by  custom  for,  and  was  responsible  for  the  employment,  training, \nsupervision and conduct of, the officers and employees of the Hopkins County Jail. \nV.  Nature of Defendants' Conduct \n15.  Defendants,  individually  and  in conspiracy  with  one  another,  engaged  in  the \nconduct described below under color of the law of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Hopkins \nCounty.  The offenses described below resulted from the failure of the state and county agencies \nand individuals to employ qualified persons for  positions of authority,  and/or to properly or \nconscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such persons after their employment, and/or to \npromulgate appropriate operating policies and procedures either formally or by custom to protect \nthe constitutional rights of the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Defendants' conduct \nwas intentional or grossly negligent, or indicated active malice toward Plaintiffs and the class or \nat least a total and reckless disregard for and indifference to their constitutional and common law \nrights, justifying an award of punitive damages in addition to the actual damages which Plaintiffs \nand the class are entitled to recover. \nVI.  Facts \n16.  On June 28, 2002, Plaintiffs Edward Lee Sutton and Lester Turner were arrested \nfor a violation of KRS 222.202 (alcohol intoxication), a misdemeanor offense, and were taken to \nthe Hopkins County Jail.  Because their offense, their background and their behavior did not \ngenerate any suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband on their \npersons, Sutton and Turner were not strip-searched upon admission to the Hopkins County Jail. \n\nThey  were  subsequently  taken  to  Court  where  they  were  ordered  released  on  their  own \nrecognizance.  Instead of being released immediately, Sutton and Turner were returned to the \nHopkins County Jail and, prior to their release, were strip-searched, apparently because of the \nrequirements of Paragraph 1 (c) of the written policy of the Hopkins County Jail, a copy of \nwhich is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. \n17.  Plaintiff Linda Joyce Ford was  arrested in  September, 2002, for writing a bad \ncheck,  a violation  of KRS  514.040,  a misdemeanor offense,  and  was  taken  to  the  Hopkins \nCounty Jail. Upon entry to the Jail, Ford was taken into a room where she was required to take \noff her clothes, squat on the floor and cough. She was then forced to turn around, bend over, \nspread her buttocks and cough. \n18.  On October 9, 2002, Timothy May was arrested for speeding ten miles over the \nspeed limit,  operating on  a suspended license and for  failure  to  pay a ticket. Each of these \noffenses are a misdemeanor.  On entry to the Hopkins County Jail, May was forced to take off all \nof his clothes, lift his genitals, tum around, bend over, and spread his buttocks. \n19.  Plaintiff Ladonia Nelson was subject to an unconstitutional strip search on four \noccasions.  In February,  2002, she was  arrested for writing a bad check, a violation of KRS \n514.040, a misdemeanor offense. She was six months pregnant. She was forced to remove her \nclothing on  a number of occasions,  squat,  spread her buttocks,  and cough.  These  searches \noccurred upon entry to the jail and immediately prior to  her release. In May,  2002, she was \narrested for failure to pay the fine for her violation of KRS 514.040. She was subjected to the \nsame treatment.  Nelson was nine months pregnant when forced to submit to the second two \nsearches. \n\n20.  Plaintiff Robin Littlepage was  arrested in August, 2002, for charges related to \nfailure to make an appearance. Upon entry to the Jail, Hopkins County officers forced her to \nremove her clothing, lift her breasts, squat for an inspection, and cough. Immediately prior to her \nrelease, Littlepage was forced  to remove her clothing in  the presence of a Hopkins  County \nofficer. \n21.  Plaintiff Robert Teague was arrested in January, 2003, for writing a bad check, a \nviolation of KRS 514.040, a misdemeanor offense. Upon entry to the Jail, Teague was forced to \nsubmit to a physical inspection of his body by removing his clothes and spreading his buttocks. \nImmediately prior to his release, he was forced to remove his clothing in front of a Hopkins \nCounty officer. \n22.  Plaintiff Tabitha Nance was arrested in May, June, and October, 2003, for theft by \ndeception for writing a bad check. On each occasion, Nance was subjected to an unconstitutional \nstrip  search  at  the  Hopkins  County  Jail  upon  entry  and  release.  On  several  occasions  in \nNovember, 2003, Nance, a female, was forced to submit to an unconstitutional strip search by a \nmale guard. \nVII.  The Law and Defendants' Policy \n23.  In  1979, the United States Supreme Court held that a pretrial detainee has the \nright  not  to  be  searched  unless  the  reasonableness  of  such  a  search  is  established  by \n\"balancing ... the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.\"  Bell v.  Wolfish,  supra at 559 (emphasis added).  On April 18, 1989, the Sixth \nCircuit issued its opinion in Masters v. Crouch, supra, in which it held: \nIt was clearly established on October 21, 1986, ... that a person \ncharged only with a traffic violation or nonviolent minor offense \nmay not be subjected to a strip-search unless there are reasonable \n\ngrounds for believing that the particular person might be carrying \nor concealing weapons or other contraband. \nId. at 1257.  In this case, Plaintiffs were arrested for nonviolent minor offenses.  Neither their \nbehavior nor their background gave Defendants any reasonable grounds for believing that they \nmight  be carrying  or concealing  weapons  or other contraband.  Under  such  circumstances, \nDefendants' requirement that Plaintiffs - on admission, and after they had been ordered released \n-- expose  the  most  private  part  of  their  physical  persons  for  a  visual  inspection  was \nunconscionable, was an illegal strip-search by any definition, and was a flagrant violation of the \nbalancing requirement of Bell v. Wolfish, supra. \nVIII.  Causes of Action \nA.  CountI \n24.  Paragraph  1-23  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 24. \n25.  Plaintiffs'  searches,  described  above,  were  part  of  a  continuing  pattern  of \nmisconduct and is the result of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, procedures, customs \nand  practices  of the  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky  and  Hopkins  County,  either  written  or \nunwritten, that are systematically applied whenever an arrestee is admitted to or released from \nthe Hopkins County Jail.  Such practices constitute an arbitrary use of government power, and \nevince a total, intentional and unreasonable disregard for the constitutional and common law \nrights of the citizens of Kentucky, including Plaintiffs and the members of the class, and the \nwholesale violations of those rights likely to result from the systematic pursuit of such practices. \n26.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs and their subclasses, through Defendants' \nintentional  or grossly negligent  conduct,  were  deprived  without  due  process  of law  of the \n\nfollowing rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United \nStates in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983: \n(a)  Their right to be secure in their person against unreasonable \nsearches  and  seizures  under  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments; \n(b)  Their right to privacy in their person against unreasonable \nintrusions  under the  Fourth,  Fifth,  Ninth  and Fourteenth \nAmendments; \n(c)  Their right to the equal protection of the law secured by the \nFourteenth Amendment; and \n(d)  Their  right  not  to  be  subjected  to  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n27.  Moreover, given the pre-existing law that clearly prohibited Defendants' conduct, \nDefendants' searches of Plaintiffs and the members of their subclass were intentional, wanton \nand malicious, and were indicative of Defendants' total and reckless disregard of, indifference to \nthe rights of, and risk of harm to, Plaintiffs and the other members of the class. \nB.  Count II \n28.  Paragraphs  1-27  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 28. \n29.  By  virtue  of the  foregoing,  Defendants,  without  justification,  negligently  or \nintentionally inflicted upon Plaintiffs and the subclasses severe mental and emotional distress. \nC.  Count III \n30.  Paragraphs  1-29  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 30. \n31.  By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants were negligent, and grossly negligent, all \nto the damage of Plaintiffs and the subclasses. \nIX.  Damages \n\n32.  Paragraphs  1-31  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 32. \n33.  Plaintiffs and the members of the classes were unjustifiably and unconstitutionally \nsearched in a manner that generated tremendous and overwhelming embarrassment, humiliation \nand mental and emotional distress.  As a result, they have suffered, and are entitled to recover, \nactual  damages.  Furthermore, Defendants'  violations  of the constitutional and common law \nrights  of Plaintiffs  and  the  classes  were  cruel,  malicious,  and  evinced  a  total  and  reckless \ndisregard for and indifference to those rights, entitling Plaintiffs and the class to recover punitive \ndamages from Defendants in order to deter such conduct in the future. \nx. \nDeclaratory Judgment and Permanent Injunction \n34.  Paragraphs  1-33  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 34. \n35.  In addition to the foregoing, Plaintiffs and the subclasses request that this Court \nissue  a  declaratory  judgment  deeming  unconstitutional  any  and  all  statutes,  ordinances, \nregulations, policies, procedures, customs or practices under which they were forced to expose \ntheir  genitalia  for  visual  inspection,  and  further  request  that this  Court permanently enjoin \nDefendants  from  following  or  enforcing  such  statutes,  ordinances,  regulations,  policies, \nprocedures, customs or usages. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the subclasses they represent request (a) that this action \nproceed as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and (b) a trial by jury, and further request that \nthey and all members of the class (c) be awarded actual and punitive damages, (d) be granted the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief requested herein, and (e) be awarded their costs, attorneys' fees, \n\npre and post judgment interest and all other relief to which they are entitled under law or in \nequity. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nDINSMORE & SHOHL LLP \na \n4~~  fJ\n,{6j4 (JRfj \nGregory AL ~ zley \n1400 PNC Plaza \n500 West Jefferson Street \nLouisville, KY 40202 \n(502) 540-2300 (Telephone) \n(502) 585-2207 (Facsimile) \nand \nFROST BROWN TODD LLC \n@ n V -\nJames R.

Plaintiffs have filed a Response \n(DN 83) objecting to the motion, and Defendants have filed \nSubsequent History: Motion denied by Sutton v. Hopkins  their Reply (DN 85) to the Response. The matter is ripe for \nCounty, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3143 (W.D. Ky., Jan. 11,  ruling. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is denied. \n2007) \nDISCUSSION \nPrior History: Sutton v. Hopkins County, 2005 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 34698 (W.D. Ky., Dec. 19, 2005)  This litigation is a class action wherein the class alleges its \nmembers  were  subjected  to  an  unlawful  strip  search  by \nCounsel:  [*1]  For Edward Lee Sutton, Individually and on  employees  of  the  Defendant,  Jim  Lanthrip,  the  Hopkins \nbehalf  of  all  others  similarly  situated,  Lester  H.  Turner,  County, Kentucky Jailer, when members of the class were \nIndividually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,  incarcerated there. \nLinda Joyce Ford, Individually and on behalf of all others \nsimilarly  situated,  Timothy  D.  May,  Individually  and  on  In an effort to determine potential class members, counsel for \nbehalf  of  all  others  similarly  situated,  Robin  Littlepage,  the  Plaintiffs  mailed  nearly  7,000  questionnaires  to  these \npotential members. Defendants apparently agreed to the form \nIndividually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, \nof the notice and questionnaire (Response, DN 83, p.2). The \nTabitha  Nance,  Individually  and  on  behalf  of  all  others \nlast of these questionnaires was mailed as late as September \nsimilarly situated, Ladonia W. Nelson, Individually and on \n15, 2005 (Motion, DN 80, p.2). To date, 564 questionnaires \nbehalf  of  all  others  similarly  situated,  Robert  R.  Teague, \nhave been completed and returned to [*3]  Plaintiffs' counsel, \nIndividually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, \nand  more  than  2,400  notices  and  questionnaires  were \nPlaintiff: Bart L. Greenwald, James Robert Craig, Laura C. \nLeone, Frost Brown Todd LLC, Louisville, KY; Gregory A.  returned, undelivered. This would leave approximately 4,000 \nBelzley, Dinsmore & Shohl, Louisville, KY.  notices and questionnaires presumably delivered for which no \nresponse was received (Response DN 83, p.2). \nFor Daniel Todd, Tony Ward, Plaintiff: Bart L. Greenwald, \nFrost Brown Todd LLC, Louisville, KY; Gregory A. Belzley,  Defendants argue that to appropriately defend/evaluate the \ncase, they are entitled to know how many persons claim to \nDinsmore & Shohl, Louisville, KY. \nhave  been  unlawfully  searched  (Motion,  DN  80,  p.2). \nFor Hopkins County, Kentucky, Jim Lantrip, Individually and  Defendants state they \"wish to contact those former inmates \nin his official capacity as Jailer of Hopkins County, Kentucky,  who were not strip searched for purposes of establishing that \nDefendant:  Allen  W.  Holbrook,  R.  Michael  Sullivan,  there was no custom of unlawfully strip searching inmates.\" \nSullivan, Mountjoy, Stainback & Miller, P.S.C., Owensboro,  (Motion, DN 80, p.2). Defendants acknowledge, \"However, \nKY;  John  T.  Soyars,   [*2]   Foster,  Soyars  &  Associates,  until those persons are no longer considered 'potential' class \nHopkinsville, KY; Stacey A. Blankenship, Denton & Keuler,  members,  Defendants  cannot  ethically  [contact  them].\" \nLLP, Paducah, KY.   (Motion, DN 80, p.2). Impervious Paint Industries v. Ashland \nOil, 508 F.Supp. 720, 723 (W.D. Ky. 1981). Obviously, any \nJudges: E. Robert Goebel, United States Magistrate Judge.   former inmate of the jail incarcerated during the relevant time \nperiod who was not subjected to a strip search at any time is \nOpinion by: E. Robert Goebel  not a potential member of the Plaintiff class, and may be \n  contacted by Defendants with impunity. However, Defendants \ndid not keep such records (Motion, DN 80, p.2). \nOpinion \n  \n\n 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11243, *3  Page 2 of 2 \nDefendants'  [*4]  solution to their dilemma is to \"propose a \nruling that Plaintiffs have sixty (60) days (presumably from a  For the Court [*5]  to rule as Defendants request would result \ndate established by the Court) in which to provide Defendants  in forever barring potential class members from coming on \nwith  a  questionnaire  for  each  class  member.  Only  those  board the lawsuit. Such a ruling by the Court is the functional \npersons that have submitted a questionnaire to Plaintiffs prior  equivalent of a court ordered mandatory \"opt in\" requirement, \nto that date, alleging an unlawful strip search and fitting into  that is \"speak\" (or act) now or forever be silenced. This the \none of the two described subclasses, should be allowed to  Court  cannot  do.  Mandatory  \"opt-in\"  requirements  for \nparticipate as a class member.

Hopkins County, Ky., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2007)   \n \n1  Plaintiffs have submitted two cases which involved the “transfer” of detainees to other facilities. See N.G. and S.G. v. Connecticut, \n382 F.3d 225 (2d Cir.2004) and Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F.Supp.2d 131 (D.Mass.2001). In N.G. and S.G., the plaintiffs were \n \njuveniles who were strip searched pursuant to Connecticut’s blanket strip search policy for all those admitted to juvenile detention \ncenters. The Second Circuit upheld the searches of the juveniles upon initial entry into the custody of the State’s juvenile \nauthorities, but found that the repetitive searches conducted upon transfer to other juvenile detention centers operated by the State \nof Connecticut was a violation. The Court finds this case distinguishable in that the State of Connecticut owned and operated all of \nthe juvenile detention centers and transported the juveniles from one facility to another. Additionally, Ford v. City of Boston did \nnot involve a detainee transferred from one county jail facility to another. Instead, in Ford, the plaintiffs were female detainees \narrested by the Boston Police Department who processed in the normal manner at the police department and then transported to the \nSuffolk County Jail for detainment. These facts appear to be more analogous to Masters than the present case. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  5 \n ",

TAYLOR, (deposed class member), CROSS-CLAIMANT\nINTERVENING PLAINTIFF \nv. MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO INTERVENE\nEDWARD LEE SUTTON, et al. PLAINTIFFS\nv.\nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY, et al. DEFENDANTS\nNow comes Chyrle A. Taylor, as cross-claimant, intervening plaintiff, by and through\ncounsel and submits this memorandum of law in support of her motion to intervene, her motion\nfor a declaration of rights and her motion to hold this matter in abeyance until such time as she\nhas had a full and fair opportunity to present her case.  \nMs. Taylor has submitted, as exhibits, the numerous and occasionally aggressive manner\nin which Plaintiff’s counsel communicated with her and sought her complete participation in this\nmatter, even to the point of threatening that her “claim” would be dismissed if she did not appear\nfor the her scheduled deposition in this case.  Plainly, all correspondence from plaintiff’s counsel\nimmediately ceased just as soon as they had obtained from her the proof she had to offer and\nonce they had used her to fulfill some of the elements to sustain the class action and to justify\ntheir fees.  Ms. Taylor never received notice of the fairness hearing and she never received notice\nof the need to file a claim form.  Plaintiff’s attorney had a duty to individually notify her and all\nother plaintiffs for whom they had addresses and phone numbers.  Notice by publication for\nthese class members, many of whom are indigent, is notice of last resort.  Notice to class\nPage 1 of  4\n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 483   Filed 08/21/09   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 5785\nmembers must always be the best notice practicable under the circumstances.  Simer v. Rios, 661\nF.2d 655, 664 (7th Cir. 1981); Many of the class members’ names and phone numbers were\navailable and counsel for plaintiffs had spoken to Ms. Taylor on the telephone on more than one\noccasion.  Under these circumstances, plaintiffs’ counsel cannot justify their failure to to provide\nindividual notice.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin,417 U.S. 156, 174 (1974); Mullane v. Central\nHanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 317 (1950); Simer, 661 F.2d at 667 n.33; Gottlieb v.\nWiles, 11 F.3d 1004, 1009 (10th Cir. 1993).\nFor those participating members of the class whose addresses and telephone numbers\nwere known to plaintiff’s counsel and still did not receive individual notice of the fairness\nhearing or of the necessity to file a claim form, there simply can be no justification for depriving\nthem of their right to intervene.  Such a prohibition is severely prejudicial to these class\nmembers.  The settlement order in this case deprives them of a meaningful opportunity to pursue\nrelief.  All the settlement does for these absent class members is “cut them off at the knees.”\nCrawford v. Equifax Payment Services Inc., 201 F.3d 877, 881 (7th Cir. 2000).\nIt is black letter law that lack of notice is absolutely essential and as a matter of\nconstitutional due process, an individual’s claim cannot be extinguished without notice and an\nopportunity to be heard. Simer. supra.  Ms. Taylor had already made a deliberate decision not to\nopt out in this case.  She was deposed after that.  The failure of Plaintiff’s counsel to fulfill their\nfiduciary duty to their known participating clients to ensure that each member was provided with\nthe claim form to participate in the settlement is tantamount to a placing her (and all others\nsimilarly situated) in a “no opt out” position.  Accordingly, the failure to allow intervention or to\ndirect the claims administrator to mail by certified mail curative notices to known participating\nPage 2 of  4\n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 483   Filed 08/21/09   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 5786\nclass members places the entire settlement at risk.  Under the particular circumstances of this\ncase and this category of class members, the settlement cannot survive.  Ortiz v. Fiberboard\nCorp., 527 U.s. 815, 144 L.Ed. 2d 715, 119 S.Ct. 2295, 2314–15 (1999): Jefferson v. Ingersoll\nInternational, Inc., 195 F.3d 894 (7th Cir. 1999).  Both Ortiz and Jefferson stress that the right to\nnotice and the right to opt out are based on the Seventh Amendment and the due process clause\nof the Fifth Amendment, as well as on the terms of Rule 23.  \nAdditionally, the settlement itself is substantively troubling.   It is essentially a weak\nsettlement that precludes other claims against the defendant by class members who participated\nin this action and there is voluminous case law warning of the special dangers in settlements\nwhen attorney fees are negotiated simultaneously with settlement or when they are an “integral\npart” of the settlement.  Ms. Taylor, like many others, has been anticipating payment in this case\nfor a long time.  She was just informed last Wednesday, August 12, 2009 that she was not a part\nof the class anymore.  She was shocked, dismayed, disappointed and confused.  Plaintiffs counsel\nfailed to adequately protect her individual interests in a case where res judicata applies.  For all\nthe foregoing reasons, Ms. Taylor should be allowed to intervene in this action for the benefit of\nall of the parties concerned.\nRespectfully submitted this the 21st day of August, 2009.\n/s/ Thresa T.

Such hearing having been held, the Court finds as follows: \n1.   This  settlement  was  mediated  by  Magistrate  Judge  Robert  Goebel.  \nMagistrate Judge Goebel is an experienced mediator and knows the obligations of the \nCourt in overseeing class action settlements of this kind.  This settlement was preceded by \nmore  than  five  years  of  litigation  in  this  case.    The  parties  evaluated  over  1000 \nquestionnaires  that  were  filled  out  and  returned  by  potential  claimants,  over  100 \ndepositions were conducted in this case, and the parties separately performed jury \nresearch in consultation with experts in jury dynamics to determine the range of results \nwere these cases tried.  As a consequence, counsel had not only a thorough understanding \nof the law and facts bearing on this litigation, but had researched the likely impact of those \nfacts on a jury were this case not settled. \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 432   Filed 10/20/08   Page 2 of 10 PageID #: 5417\n2.  The settlement in this case was reached only after numerous, private, arms-\nlength  negotiations  between  the  parties,  and  after  no  less  than  three  settlement \nconferences mediated by Magistrate Judges, in which each side repeatedly argued its \nposition and argued the risks the other would bear were the case not settled.  The \nstrengths and weaknesses of the case on both sides were thoroughly researched, explored \nthrough discovery, and argued in settlement.  There is no question but that counsel had \nsufficient information to arrive at an informed evaluation on which this settlement is based. \n3.  This class action covers the period from January 9, 2002 to June 8, 2008.  \nPlaintiffs claimed that the Hopkins County Detention Center (“the Jail”) had in place a policy \nwhich required that all persons, even persons arrested for minor offenses, be strip-\nsearched before their admission to the Jail’s general population, and after they became \nentitled to release from the Jail.  The Jail, however, had in place a written policy which \nDefendants claimed prohibited the strip-searches of persons arrested for minor offenses on \nadmission to the Jail unless there existed reasonable grounds for believing that such \narrestees were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.  Although the Jail had a \nwritten policy that indicated that all detainees who were taken to court and then returned to \nthe Jail were to be strip-searched, a policy that Plaintiffs contended was applied even if \ndetainees were ordered released, Defendants claimed that the Jail's unwritten custom and \npractice was to strip-search on return to the Jail only those persons who had not been \nordered released.  Plaintiffs also claimed that Defendants performed illegal strip-searches \nby observing pre-trial detainees while they changed into and out of jail uniforms, a claim \nthat was also contested by Defendants. \n  - 2 - \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 432   Filed 10/20/08   Page 3 of 10 PageID #: 5418\n4.  Liability was thus a vigorously contested issue in this case, unlike prior strip-\nsearch class action cases in Kentucky in which the defendants' unlawful conduct was \nactually directed by a written policy of the jail in issue.  It was unclear how many Plaintiffs \nwould be willing to surrender their anonymity and bear the inconvenience of testifying at \ntrial about an incident that many might consider personal and embarrassing.  Those that \nchose to testify would then be presented with the challenge of communicating to the jury \ntheir recollection of incidents that may have occurred more than six years ago.  Were \nPlaintiffs to prevail on the issue of liability, Plaintiffs would then have to endure a second \nseries of trials, in which each Plaintiff's damages would likely be determined separately, \nand each Plaintiff would be confronted with the challenge of communicating to the jury the \ndepth of the intangible damages -- the humiliation, shame and distress -- they sustained as \na consequence of their strip-search.  Even were these damages effectively communicated \nto the jury, it was likely that jury verdicts would vary greatly in amount.  While a jury could \naward damages in excess of the sum a claimant might receive under this settlement, there \nwas as great a chance that the jury might award significantly less, particular to those who \nhaving a lengthy criminal history.  Throughout the litigation, the question would remain \nwhether jurors would be predisposed to believe law enforcement officials over other \ncitizens,  particularly  citizens  with  a  criminal  record.    Counsel  for  Defendants  were \nexperienced litigators and would continue to provide a vigorous defense against all claims.     \n5.  Defendants were unwilling voluntarily to pay more to settle this case.  Pushing \non to trial would have significantly delayed Plaintiffs' recovery, if any.  Had trials eventually \nresulted in even greater total liability for the County, Plaintiffs would have been confronted \n  - 3 - \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 432   Filed 10/20/08   Page 4 of 10 PageID #: 5419\nwith the additional delay of appeals, and depending on future circumstances, the additional \nrisk of recoverability of the judgment. \n  6.  Class members under the settlement are divided into four groups:  (a) the \nnamed class representatives, who surrendered their anonymity and spearheaded this \nlitigation throughout its course; (b) the unnamed class members who responded to \nquestionnaires sent by counsel and were subsequently deposed in the case; (c) unnamed \nclass members who are members of both the \"Entry\" and \"Release\" classes certified in this \ncase; and (d) unnamed class members who are only a member of one class or the other. \nThe settlement provides that the ten named class representatives will divide among \nthemselves the sum of $250,000.00.  Named class representatives, depending upon their \nlength in service, will receive between $15,000.00 and $35,000.00 each.  Plaintiffs at the \nhearing provided the Court an Exel spreadsheet showing 32 prior strip-search class action \nsettlements.    That  spreadsheet  shows  that  amounts  typically  paid  named  class \nrepresentatives, in cases in which it can be determined, range between $10,000.00 and \n$25,000.00.    \n7.  With the exception of Messrs. Sutton and Turner, who originated this case, \nthe named class representatives are receiving between $15,000.00 and $25,000.00, well \nwithin the range of reasonableness established by prior settlements.  The $35,000.00 to be \npaid to Messrs. Sutton and Turner is not unreasonable, either.  This is all the named class \nrepresentatives will receive -- they will not be entitled to any additional payment under the \nterms of the Settlement Agreement proposed to the Court. \n8.  Not enough can be said for the individual citizen, with no formal legal training, \nwho believes their constitutional rights have been violated, exercises the initiative of \n  - 4 - \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 432   Filed 10/20/08   Page 5 of 10 PageID #: 5420\ncontacting counsel, and then agrees to surrender their anonymity and be named as a \nplaintiff in a civil rights case that becomes a matter of public record.  The named class \nrepresentatives participated in three mediations of this case, numerous meetings with \ncounsel and periodic contact via telephone, and responded to written discovery and were \nall deposed.  They have honorably discharged their responsibilities as named class \nrepresentatives, and each approved the settlement that has now been tendered to the \nCourt. \n9.  The Court should encourage citizens to make the sacrifices and accept the \nresponsibilities  willingly  undertaken  and  faithfully  discharged  by  the  named  class \nrepresentatives in this case.  The Court has compared these amounts to settlements in \ncomparable cases, and has found them reasonable, particularly given the length and \ncomplexity of this litigation, the named class representatives' numerous meetings with \ncounsel and their attendance at three separate mediations (all of which occurred in a city \nother than the one in which they live), the faithful discharge of their duties, and the \nsignificance of this case and the ultimate result. \n10.  Unnamed class members with qualifying claims, who filled out and returned \nquestionnaires and were also deposed in this case, will be paid $4,000.00 each.  This \namount compares very favorably even to settlements in which liability was not an issue, \nand the fact that these class members will receive more than the other members of the \nunnamed class is warranted given the initiative exercised by these class members in filling \nout and returning a questionnaire with no expectation of gain, and then submitting to a \nvideotaped deposition in which they were examined by opposing counsel.   \n  - 5 - \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 432   Filed 10/20/08   Page 6 of 10 PageID #: 5421\n11.  The recovery of remaining unnamed class members who qualify as members \nof both the \"Entry\" and the \"Release\" classes will be capped at $2,500.00.  The recovery of \nclass members who belong to only one class or the other will be capped at $1,500.00.  \nDefendants were unwilling to agree to caps any higher than these.  The named class \nrepresentatives had to choose whether to accept such caps, or reject such caps, scuttle the \nsettlement, and proceed to trial with all the delay inherent in such a process, not to mention \nthe  ever-present  risk  of  non-recovery.    Given  the  hard  financial  realities  presently \nconfronting many potential claimants, the named class representatives decided to accept \nthe caps and tender this settlement for the consideration of the class.  These caps \nnonetheless compare very favorably even to settlements in which liability was not an issue.  \nThus, while there are disparities in the treatment of members of the class, the Court finds \nthe basis for those disparities to be reasonable, and the amounts in issue to be fair, \nreasonable and adequate. \n12.  Class members will only recover for one entry search and/or one release \nsearch, even though they may have been subjected to multiple entry and release searches.  \nHowever, allowing class members to recover for searches following multiple arrests would \nsubstantially complicate and increase the expense of class administration, thus reducing \nthat portion of the settlement fund available to pay the claims of unnamed class members.  \nFrom a public policy standpoint, allowing class members to recover for searches following \nmultiple arrests effectively rewards repeated acts of criminal conduct, which instead should \nbe discouraged.  The recovery of a claimant with a lengthy criminal record should not \nexceed that of a citizen subjected to a violation of her constitutional rights and an egregious \n  - 6 - \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 432   Filed 10/20/08   Page 7 of 10 PageID #: 5422\ninvasion of her privacy following her sole arrest.  The Court thus finds this provision of the \nsettlement to be fair and reasonable. \n13.  Funds will revert to Defendants only if -- after all payments contemplated by \nthe settlement, including the maximum approved claimants can receive under the terms of \nthe settlement -- there remain any funds in the settlement account.  As a consequence, the \nreversion provision of the proposed Settlement Agreement in no way infringes upon the \namount, fairness or reasonableness of what will be paid to qualified claimants.  Moreover, \nas with the per claim caps, reversion was a non-negotiable condition of settlement for \nDefendants, and reflected a responsible effort on Defendants' part given public funding of \nthe settlement amount.  \n14.  No  amount  of  the  settlement  fund  will  be  set  aside  for  late  claims.  \nEstablishing such a reserve would decrease the sums paid to qualified claimants if the \nsettlement fund would otherwise be exhausted by payment approved claims.  In addition, a \nreserve would necessarily raise thorny issues of the amount of the appropriate set-aside, \nthe appropriate grace period to allow for late claims, disparities in treatment of claimants, \nand what should be done in the event the amount set aside is too much or too little.  These \nissues would unnecessarily complicate an otherwise straightforward settlement process, \nand would increase claims administration expense, thus reducing the recovery of approved \nclaimants. \n15.  Plaintiffs' counsel is seeking to recover only for the time and expense they \nhave actually invested in this case.  Greg Belzley, lead counsel for the class, is an \nexperienced litigator and a partner at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP.  He first became involved in \nstrip-search litigation with the filing of Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.), cert. \n  - 7 - \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 432   Filed 10/20/08   Page 8 of 10 PageID #: 5423\ndenied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989).  He has since been lead counsel for plaintiffs in five strip-\nsearch class actions, three of which have previously been settled.  This case is one of two \nstrip-search class actions now pending in Kentucky in which Mr. Belzley is lead counsel for \nPlaintiffs.  Mr. Belzley has argued numerous strip-search appeals before the First and Sixth \nCircuits, including an en banc proceeding before the First Circuit.  Mr. Belzley is highly \nexperienced in the law, litigation and settlement of strip-search class actions.  Bart L. \nGreenwald is a commercial litigator with class action experience, and a partner at Frost \nBrown Todd LLC.  He and Mr. Belzley and their respective firms shared the load in this \ncase.  Plaintiffs turned to these Louisville firms after they were unable to find more local \ncounsel to represent them.   \n16.  This Court has observed the conduct of these counsel throughout this \nlitigation.  The record reflects that they have skillfully, effectively and zealously advocated \nthe position of the class throughout these proceedings, and have achieved a fair and \nreasonable result for their clients.  More than five years of hard-fought litigation preceded \nthis settlement.  Discovery was extensive and thorough.  Issues of class certification and \nliability were thoroughly researched and argued and reargued as the parties vied for \nadvantage.  Civil rights and class action litigation both involve complex issues of law and \nprocedure.  Plaintiffs’ counsel bore all fees and expenses during the five years of this \nlitigation, and bore all risk of loss had Plaintiffs not prevailed.  Instead of seeking some \nprofit to offset the time and expenses put at risk in this litigation, Plaintiffs' counsel seeks \nonly to be compensated for the time and expense actually invested in the case, a request \nthat has been unanimously approved by the named class representatives.   \n  - 8 - \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 432   Filed 10/20/08   Page 9 of 10 PageID #: 5424\n17.  The notice of settlement and claim form were negotiated by the parties with \nthe assistance of, and were ultimately approved by, Magistrate Judge Goebel.  The notice \nof settlement is simple and straightforward, as is the proof of claim form.  The parties have \ncreated a settlement process that can be understood and administered by the claimants \nthemselves, regardless of their socio-economic or educational background.  Approved \nclaimants will receive a substantial settlement simply by completing a proof of claim form \nand mailing it back to the Claims Administrator for verification and approval.  Each claimant \nwhose claim is rejected will receive a letter explaining why the claim was rejected, and will \nbe provided the opportunity of an appeal first to the Claims Administrator, and then to this \nCourt.  There was no evidence at the hearing that claimants do not understand the terms of \nthe settlement, find the proof of claim form confusing or hard to complete, or do not \nunderstand the process by which they may assert a claim for recovery of a portion of the \nsettlement. \n18.  More than 3,400 notices have been mailed to potential claimants explaining \nthe terms of the settlement and detailing the method by which claimants could file \nobjections.  In addition, notice has been published in 11 newspapers published in and \naround Hopkins County, including the Madisonville Messenger and the Louisville Courier-\nJournal.  No objections have been filed to the terms of the settlement discussed above, and \nthe Court regards this fact as additional evidence establishing the fairness, reasonableness \nand adequacy of the settlement under review. \n19.  The Claims Administrator, Analytics, Inc., is continuing to seek potential \nclaimants for whom it has no address or has a bad address, and mail notice as soon as a \n  - 9 - \n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 432   Filed 10/20/08   Page 10 of 10 PageID #: 5425\nnew address is found.  In addition, all persons who contacted Plaintiffs’ counsel or the \nClaims Administrator to advise of their potential claim were also mailed claim forms.       \nFor all the reasons set forth above, the Court finds the settlement in this litigation \nto be fair, reasonable and adequate under the circumstances, and that the interests of the \nclass as a whole are better served by this settlement instead of the pursuit of this litigation \nthrough trial.  By separate Judgment, claims of all class members who have not made a \ntimely request to be excluded from the class will be dismissed with prejudice.   \nThis the _____ day of ____________, 2008. \n \n                         \n            United States District Court Judge \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n/s/ Gregory A.

      "text": "S=ILED \nJEFFREY A. APPERSON, CLERK \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nWESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY \nJUL 11 2008 \nAT OWENSBORO \nU.S. lJiv i t'(.ll.,; I COURT \nWEST'N. OIST. KENTUCKY \nEDWARD LEE SUTTON, et al.,  ) \n) \nPlaintiffs  ) \n) \nvs.  )  CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:03CV- 3-M \n) \nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY, et al.,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PARTIAL \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT AND FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nMay it please the Court: \nFor  more  than  two  decades,  the  Sixth  Circuit  and  courts  across  the  country  have \nconsistently held that pretrial detainees arrested for non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanor \noffenses may not be strip searched upon admission to a detention facility without individualized \nreasonable suspicion that the particular detainee is hiding weapons or contraband.  In complete \ndisregard  for  this  firmly  established  constitutional  standard,  the  Defendants  admit  that  the \nHopkins  County Jail  (the \"Jail\") employs a blanket policy of strip searching all  arrestees -\nincluding all non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanor offenders - who are transferred to the \nJail from  another facility,  without making any  individualized determination whether there is \nreasonable suspicion that any particular transferee is concealing contraband or weapons.  This \npolicy, on its face, plainly violates the Fourth Amendment.  The Plaintiff Class, therefore, is \nentitled to a partial summary judgment finding that the Jail's policy is unconstitutional, and that \n\nany class member searched pursuant to the Jail's policy has been subjected to an illegal search in \nviolation of the class member's constitutional rights. \nMoreover, preliminary injunctive relief is necessary to cease the pattern and practice of \nillegal strip searches that is currently ongoing at the Hopkins County Jail.  Every day, individuals \nadmitted to the Jail following an institutional transfer are  subjected to unconstitutional strip \nsearches that are not warranted by any individualized reasonable suspicion.  The harm caused by \nthese constitutional violations is irreparable.  Preliminary injunctive relief is therefore necessary \nto cease these constitutional violations pending a full adjudication of the merits and entry of \nappropriate permanent injunctive relief. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis is a class action lawsuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1983, which was originally filed by \nPlaintiffs Edward Lee Sutton and Lester H. Turner \"in their individual capacities and on behalf \nof all persons arrested for minor offenses who  were required by Defendants in the Hopkins \nCounty Jail to remove their clothing for visual inspection despite the absence of any reasonable \ngrounds for believing they were concealing weapons or contraband.\"  [Complaint ~ 1.]  The \nPlaintiffs'  class  action complaint alleged that \"such searches  have  been and  continue to  be \nregularly conducted by Defendants and there are potentially hundreds of members of the subject \nclass.\"  [Jd.] \nOn March 16, 2005, the Court entered an Agreed Order granting Plaintiffs' motion for \nclass certification.  [3/16/05 Class Cert. Order.]  The Court's Order certified two subclasses - the \n\"Admissions Class\" and the \"Release Class\" - defined as follows: \na.  All persons arrested for minor offenses who were required by Defendants \nin the Hopkins County Jail (\"Jail\"), after becoming entitled to release, to remove \ntheir clothing for a visual inspection .... [the \"Release Class\"] \n2 \n\n[b.]  All  persons  arrested  for  non-violent,  non-drug  related  misdemeanor \noffenses who were required by the Defendants in the Jail to remove their clothing \nfor  a  visual  inspection  on admission to  the  Jail  despite  the  absence  of any \nreasonable  suspicion  that  they  were  carrying  or  concealing  weapons  or \ncontraband. [the \"Admissions Class\"] \n[3/16/05 Class Cert.  Order ~~ 2-3.]  Each of these classes includes all persons who were so \ntreated from January 9, 2002, to the present.  [Id. ~ 4.] \nThe Named Class Representatives of the Admissions Class are Plaintiffs Linda Joyce \nFord, Timothy D. May, Ladonia W. Nelson, Robin Littlepage, Robert R. Teague, Tabitha Nance, \nDaniel Todd and Tony Ward.  [Third Am. Compl. ~ 3.]  Each of these Plaintiffs was admitted to \nthe Jail following an arrest on minor, non-weapons-related, non-drug-related offenses, including \nwriting bad checks, failure to appear, and traffic violations.  [Third Am. Compl. ~~ 17-24.]  Each \nof the Class Representatives of the Admissions Class alleged that upon admission to the Jail, \nthey were forced to remove their clothes and submit to a visual strip search inspection.  [Id.] \nDuring these searches, Plaintiffs were, among other things, subjected to visual inspection of their \ngenitals, instructed to bend over and spread their buttocks for visual inspection, and, in the case \nof female Plaintiffs, asked to lift their breasts for inspection.

C); Teague Dep. at 33-36 (attached as Exh. D).] \nUNDISPUTED FACTS \nIn his deposition, James Lantrip, who served as Hopkins County Jailer from 1987 until \nhis retirement on July 31, 2005, explained the policies and procedures of the Hopkins County \nJail (the \"Jail\") governing strip searching arrestees upon admission to the Jail.  [1/17/06 Lantrip \nDep. at 6 -21 (attached as Exh. E).]  According to Jailer Lantrip, an arrestee brought to the Jail is \nmet at the door by a Jail officer and asked to complete a medical questionnaire to determine \n3 \n\nwhether there is a need for immediate medical attention.  [1117/06 Lantrip Dep. at 11.]  If no \nimmediate medical attention is required, the arrestee is taken to the booking desk, where the \nbooking officer collects information for the purposes of doing an \"initial classification,\" which \nincludes determining whether the arrestee is to be strip searched.  [1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 15.] \nIf the booking officer determines that an arrestee \"fall[s] under a strip searchable reason,\" \nthey would be strip searched.  [1117/06 Lantrip Dep. at 6-7.]  According to official Jail policy, \n\"strip searchable reasons\"  include charges involving serious violent felonies,  past history of \nviolence,  drug  charges,  suicide  risk,  and  \"people  coming  from  other  facilities  not  in  your \njurisdiction that you had no control over before they arrived\": \nQ:  Now, when you were the Jailer at the Hopkins County jail, what was the \npolicy at the jail for strip search of persons on admission to the jail? \nA:  Well, you question them, you look at their charges, why they're there. \nDetermine if they fall under the strip searchable reasons. \n* * * * \nQ:  That being whether they were a felon, had a past history of violence, were \ndrug  charges,  suicide risk,  people coming from  other facilities,  is that \nwhat you'd look at? \nA:  At his initial arrest? \nQ:  Yes. \nA:  Yes. \n[1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 6-7.] \nNotably,  the  initial  booking  process  does  not  include  running  a  criminal  history \nbackground check, or \"NCIC\" report, on the arrestee.  [1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 15-18.]  Further, \na full criminal history check is not performed on an arrestee until the \"full-blown classification\" \nprocess, which is performed the day after the arrestee is booked into the Jail.  [1117/06 Lantrip \n4 \n\nDep. at 15-16.]  Thus, the decision to strip search an arrestee is made before obtaining a criminal \nhistory report on the subject.  [1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 17.] \nHopkins County Jail Policy Concerning Strip Search ofI nstitutional Transfers \nJailer Lantrip testified that in addition to strip searches that might be ordered based on \nfactors such as history of contraband, drug charges, or suicide risk, the Jail's official policy also \ncalls for automatically strip searching all arrestees who are transferred to the Hopkins County \nJail from another jurisdiction, regardless of the charge: \nQ:  Now  you  also  mentioned· strip  searching  people  coming  from  other \nfacilities.  Now what do you mean by that? \nA:  If we get - our sheriff goes somewhere and picks somebody up, bring [s ] \nhim  back here  from  a jail  in  another  county  or  state  or  a  sheriff or \nsomebody from  another county or state brought one to  us,  we'll have \noccasions where the jail themselves may transfer someone to  us  from \nanother facility. \nQ:  Now would those persons be strip searched? \nA:  Yes. \nQ:  Regardless of their charge? \nA:  Yes. \n[1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 26.  See also  12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. (Defendants' Expert) at 64-65 \n(attached as Exh.  F);  August 30, 2005  Soyars Letter,  Exhibit 7 to  12/5/05  Sabbatine Dep. \n(attached as Exh. G) (\"The jail does have a policy of strip-searching inmates upon transfer from \nanother facility.\").]  Thus, traffic offenders and minor misdemeanor offenders - as well as those \narrested  on  more  serious  charges  - are  subject  to  automatic  strip  searches  following  an \ninstitutional transfer to the Jail.  [1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 26.] \nJailer Lantrip testified that this is a \"blanket policy.\"  [1117/06 Lantrip Dep. at 27.]  All \narrestees who are transferred from other jurisdictions or facilities are strip searched, without \n5 \n\nregard to the circumstances surrounding the transfer or other factors  indicating that there  is \nreasonable suspicion to believe the arrestee is secreting contraband: \nQ:  Now,  have  there  been  institutional  transfers,  arrestees  brought  to  the \nHopkins County jail from other facilities  that you are familiar with in \nwhich a decision was made to forego a strip search of that individual? \nA:  Shouldn't be. \nQ:  So this is a blanket policy, anyone coming to Hopkins County jail from \nanother facility is to be strip searched period? \nA:  Period. \n* * * * \nA:  . Policy is  one of those things  one  shoe fits  everybody with rare,  rare \nexceptions I would think, and off the top of my head I can't even think of one  ... \n.  Okay, so, you know, that's just one of those things, so it's a blanket thing.  If \nyou come from another facility that we have not authority over, no control of, \nyou're checked when you hit our door. \n[1117/06 Lantrip Dep. at 27,52-53 (emphasis added).] \nJailer Lantrip stated that transferees are strip searched out of a concern that the arrestee \nmight have obtained contraband either during their prior stay in the transferring facility or during \ntheir transportation to  the Hopkins County Jail,  and might smuggle this contraband into the \nHopkins County Jail.  [1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 26.]  However, Jailer Lantrip admitted that the \nJail's policy is not based on any particular facts known to the Jail staff about the circumstances \nunder which arrestees are transferred, such as what kind of security precautions are taken by the \nHopkins  County  Sheriff  in  conducting  the  transfer  or  whether  the  arrestees  were  ever \nunsupervised during the transfer.  [1117/06 Lantrip Dep. at 51-52.] \nJailer Lantrip testified, for example, that the Jail staff knew \"very little\" about the Sheriff \nDepartment's security practices in transferring arrestees: \n6 \n\nQ:  What  do  you  know  about  the  security  procedures  employed  by  the \nHopkins County Sheriff in transporting prisoners that they'd picked up at \nanother jail to the Hopkins County Jail? \nA:  Very little.  I couldn't tell you that it was any better or worse than \nanyone else's.  That would probably depend on which officer went. \n[1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 51 (emphasis added).] \nJailer Lantrip also admitted that upon admission of a detainee transferred from another \nfacility, Jail staff did not inquire about the circumstances of a particular detainee's transfer to \ndetermine if that detainee had an opportunity to obtain or conceal contraband: \nQ:  .... I'm just talking about whether [the arrestees] could have acquired \ncontraband while in the custody of the Hopkins County sheriff. \nA:  Yes, they could.  I mean, you never know if there's a bathroom stop or \nwhatever. \nQ:  Can you determine that once they're admitted to the Hopkins County jail? \nA:  Could I determine that? \nQ:  Yeah.  You could ask the sheriff whether there'd been a bathroom stop or \nany opportunity for -\nA:  I guess you could.  I don't think we ever did. \n[1/17/06 Lantrip Dep.at 52 (emphasis added).] \nThus, under the Jail's policy, the decision to strip search arrestees transferred from other \nfacilities was not based on any actual information indicating a risk of contraband smuggling \namong institutional transferees as a class of offenders, or any individualized determination that a \nparticular arrestee had an opportunity to hide contraband.  Rather, Jailer Lantrip testified that \narrestees transferred from other facilities were strip searched merely because the Jail did not \nknow the circumstances of their custodial history: \"I have no idea what kind of jail they came \nfrom, how tight it was run or how loose it was run, what they were allowed to have in that jail.  I \n7 \n\nhave no idea where they stopped en route to our jail, who they've had contact with, those type \nthings.\"  [1117/06 Lantrip Dep. at 26 (emphasis added).] \nExpert testimony concerning justification for strip searches ofi nstitutional transfers \nNotwithstanding the justification offered for the Jail's blanket strip search policy by Jailer \nLantrip, Defendants' own purported expert witness, Ray Sabbatine, testified that the mere fact \nthat an arrestee  is  transferred from  another facility,  in the  absence  of other factors,  is  not \nsufficient justification for a strip search: \nQ:  .... [J]ust the mere fact that they're being institutionally transferred, that \nalone is not a justification for a strip search? \nA:  That's correct in the absence of other factors that would justify the search. \n[12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. at 70-71 (attached as Exh. F).] \nSabbatine is a consultant in the field of criminal justice, who has served in a number of \npositions in the Kentucky criminal justice system, including jail administrator for Lexington, \nKY.  He was retained by the Defendants to render an opinion \"as to the propriety of both policy \nand practice of the Hopkins County Detention Center as they relate to the strip-searching of \noffenders housed in that facility.\"  [7/17/03  Sabbatine  Report  at  1.]  Sabbatine  based his \nopinions  upon an examination of \"the policies  of the  [Hopkins  County]  facility  and  their \nconsistency with State and Federal standards of care and whether practices are consistent with \nacceptable policy.\"  [Id.] \nSabbatine's testimony was clear that, in his expert opinion, strip searching an arrestee \nsolely because the arrestee was transferred from another jurisdiction is not justified: \nQ:  .... [W]hen you've got an inmate  coming from  another facility  for \nwhatever reason, ... under what circumstances would it be inappropriate \nto strip search them? \n8 \n\nA:  If a person were not otherwise strippable and the person did not spend - in \nother words, the person did not go beyond the booking area of the other \nfacility  and then were transferred to the second jail and they were not \nstrippable, in other words, it would almost be similar to a person being \narrested, taken to the police station for an interview, and then dropped off \nat jail, then I  don't believe that to  give  me reason to be concerned \nabout the presence of a contraband for an otherwise nonstrippable \noffender.  Okay? \nAs the period of time extends in the sending facility and whether \nor not there was a hospital run of that person because they may have been \na DUI that ended up going to the hospital and then coming back to the \nfacility and then transferred to the second facility, in other words, in order \nto examine it I need the full circumstance of the custodial happenings \nin the initial facility.  Time would be a factor, incident would be a factor; \nokay?  If in the original facility they were undergoing a pat frisk and there \nwere contraband uncovered, if they were undergoing a pat search and they \nrefused the pat search and said, don't touch me, okay, if that other facility \nhad an alert on them for suicide, if that other facility had an alert on them \nfor prior introduction of contraband, okay, that and the transfer of that \ninformation to the second facility would give reason for examination at \nthe second facility as to whether or not the person was searchable. \nSo when you talk about a custodial time frame, to have only one \npiece of it doesn't give me enough information to draw a conclusion \nthat would satisfy me as to whether or not the person was likely to be \nstrippable when they entered the second facility. \n[12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. at 67-69 (emphasis added).]  Thus, Defendants' own expert conceded \nthat the mere fact that a detainee was transferred from another facility, by itself, does not indicate \na  security  risk  sufficient to justify  a  strip  search.  Only  an  examination  of the  individual \ncircumstances surrounding the arrestee's custodial history would provide enough information to \ndetermine that a sufficient risk of contraband existed to warrant a search. [Id.] \nPlaintiffs'  expert witness,  Gordon Kamka,  echoed Mr.  Sabbatine's testimony on this \nissue and opined that \"[a] strip search due to transfer from another correctional facility cannot be \njustified for security reasons ....\"   [8/30/05 PIs. Tender of Supp. Expert Op.] \n9 \n\nRecords ofs earches conducted pursuant to County's blanket strip search policy \nThe records produced by the Defendants demonstrate the scope and regularity of the \nJail's blanket strip search policy for arrestees transferred from other facilities.  These records \nreveal that strip searches of institutional transferees have been, and continue to be, a routine and \nfrequent occurrence at the Jail. \nBeginning in July 2003, the Jail began using a \"Jail Tracker\" computer program, which \nrecords  every instance  in which a  strip  search  was performed, the  reason  each search was \nconducted, and the results of the search.  [1117/06 Lantrip Dep. at 39.]  In response to Plaintiffs' \ndiscovery requests, Defendants produced Jail Tracker records for all strip searches conducted by \nthe Defendants between July 2003 and May 25,2006.  The Jail Tracker records show that during \nthis period, 1159 arrestees were subjected to strip searches after being transferred to the Jail from \nanother facility.  [B. Thacker Aff. ~~ 4-5 & Exhibit A thereto (attached as Exh. H).]  For each of \nthese 1159 strip searches, the only grounds for the search identified in Defendants' records is \n\"transfer from another facility.\"  [B. Thacker Aff. ~ 5.]  No other factors supporting the decision \nto search, such as history of contraband, drug charges, etc., are identified in any of these records. \n[Id.] \nMoreover, Plaintiffs' inspection of Defendants' records revealed that these strip searches \ngenerated some kind of positive result in only six (6) of the 1159 instances, which equates to \napproximately five-tenths of one percent (0.5%) of the persons searched.  [Id. at ~ 6.]  In five \nof these instances, moreover, the only contraband reported found was identified as cigarettes, \ntobacco, or matches, while the sixth result was listed merely as \"code 4.\"  [Id. at ~ 6.]1 \n,1 Moreover, the Jail Tracker records do not indicate whether the contraband was found somewhere where \nonly a strip search would detect it - such as in a body cavity - as opposed to the arrestee's clothing, where \na simple pat down search could have located it. \n10 \n\nPrior to the implementation of the Jail Tracker program in July 2003, the practice of the \nJ ail was to only make a record of a strip search when the search was performed pursuant to an \nindividualized reasonable suspicion and there was a positive finding of contraband.  [1117/06 \nLantrip Dep. at 38-40; 12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. at 38-39.]  Thus, prior to July 2003, the Jail failed \nto make any record of strip searches conducted pursuant to an automatic or blanket strip search \npolicy or where no contraband was found.  This failure to document pre-July 2003 strip searches \nwas contrary to  the mandates of the applicable Kentucky Administrative Regulations, which \nprovide  that  \"[t]he  Jailer  shall  require  that  a  strip  search  or  body  cavity  search  shall  be \ndocumented.\"  501 KAR 3:120, § 23(c)1. \nEven in the absence of reliable Jail records prior to July 2003, however, the post July \n2003 Jail Tracker records, combined with Jailer Lantrip's testimony, clearly reveal the scope and \nregularity of the Jail's policy of strip searching all arrestees transferred from other facilities. \nThe undisputed facts plainly demonstrate that at all times relevant to this lawsuit, every detainee \nwho  came to  the Jail from  another facility was  subjected to  an automatic strip search upon \narrival.  This  policy resulted  in a large  number  of arrestees - including those  arrested  for \nnonviolent misdemeanor and traffic-related offenses - being strip searched, despite the absence \nof any other factors indicating that the particular arrestee was likely to pose a risk of smuggling \nweapons or contraband. \nStrip searches ofN  amed Plaintiff class representatives \nSeveral of the Named Plaintiff class representatives are among those who were subjected \nto  suspicionless  strip  searches  pursuant  to  the  Jail's  blanket  strip  search  policy.  In  his \nsupplemental expert report, Mr. Sabbatine reviewed materials relating to Named Plaintiffs Linda \nH. Ford, Timothy P. May, Robert R. Teague, Robin G. Littlepage, Tabitha L. Joyce, and Ladonia \n11 \n\nDavis Nelson.  [11122/05  Sabbatine Supp. Rep. at 1.]  Sabbatine's review of the record showed \nthat five of these six Plaintiffs had been strip searched following a transfer from another facility? \n[Id.  See a/so, e.g., Ford Dep. at 18-22; May Dep. at 27-30; Nelson Dep. at 20-22; Teague Dep. \nat 33.] \nFor at least two of these Named Plaintiffs, Linda Ford and Timothy May, Mr. Sabbatine \nconceded that he could find no factors that would justify a strip search, other than the transfer \nfrom another facility.  [11/22/05 Sabbatine Supp. Rep. at 2.]  Sabbatine therefore opined that the \navailable information was \"not conclusive\" of the need for  a  strip search.  [Id.]  Sabbatine \ntestified that the mere fact that Ford and May were transferred from another facility would not \nwarrant a strip search.  [12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. at 70.]  Whether a strip search of these Plaintiffs \nwas justified, Sabbatine explained, depended on whether officers at the Jail had made queries \nabout  the  circumstances  surrounding  each  detainee's  transfer,  and  whether  the  particular \ninformation  they  learned  demonstrated  a  risk  that  the  individual  detainee  was  concealing \ncontraband: \nA:  Both  Ford  and  May  were  transferred.  I  don't  know  whether  the \ninformation was transferred from  the transferring facility to the second \nfacility.  I  do  not know whether there were  queries  by  the  second \nfacility, Hopkins, as to whether there were circumstances that would \nhave justified a search .... \n* * * * \nQ:  Right.  So the mere fact of an institutional transfer without more does not \nautomatically necessitate or justify a strip search by the receiving facility; \ncorrect? \nA:  The circumstances of the transfer may.  The transfer in itself without \nadditional factors may not. \nNotably, in the case of the one Named Plaintiff who had not been transferred from another facility, \n2 \nRobin G. Littlepage, Mr.  Sabbatine did not find any information in her records that would support a \ndecision to conduct a strip search.  [11122/05 Sabbatine Supp. Report at 2; 12/5/05  Sabbatine Dep. at 75.] \n12 \n\n[12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. at 69-70 (emphasis added).]3 \nARGUMENT \nDefendants'  records  indicate  that  since  July  2003,  1159  strip  searches  have  been \nconducted on the sole grounds that the detainee was transferred from another facility, without \nany other articulated basis for suspecting the detainee of harboring contraband.  These strip \nsearches  plainly violate  well  established principles  of constitutional  law,  which hold that  a \npretrial detainee charged with non-violent, non-drug-related offenses may not be subjected to the \nsevere humiliation and invasion entailed by a strip search without at least an individualized \nreasonable suspicion that the detainee is harboring contraband.  The mere fact that a detainee has \nbeen transferred from another facility does not excuse jail officials from satisfying the Fourth \nAmendment's individualized reasonable suspicion requirement.  Nor does the fact of a transfer, \nwithout more, satisfy the individualized reasonable suspicion requirement.  The Plaintiffs are \ntherefore entitled to a partial summary judgment finding Defendants' policy unconstitutional and \nfinding that any member of the Admissions Class searched pursuant to Defendant's policy has \nbeen subjected to an unconstitutional strip search. \nI.  Defendants' blanket policy to automatically strip search all detainees transferred \nfrom  other  facilities,  without  individualized  reasonable  suspicion,  is \nunconstitutional. \n\"Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact \nand the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\"  Ireland v.  Tunis,  113 \nWith respect to Named Plaintiffs Teague and Nelson, Sabbatine indicated that a search could have been \n3 \njustified based on information that these individuals had drug-related charges in their criminal histories. \nHowever, Sabbatine could not verify whether the drug-related charges pre-dated or post-dated the strip \nsearch.  [12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. at 71-73.]  Sabbatine also admitted that he \"had no way of knowing\" \nwhether the Jail was in possession of this criminal history information at the time the strip searches were \nordered.  [12/5/05  Sabbatine Dep. at 108-09.]  Mr.  Sabbatine also suggested that the strip search of \nPlaintiff Nance may have been justified by an indication ofa prior suicide attempt.  However, Ms. Nance \ndenied telling the Jail officers that she was suicidal at the time of her admission, or that she had attempted \nto kill herself within the past three months.  [Nance Dep. at 15-16 (attached as Exh. I).] \n13 \n\nF.3d 1435, 1440 (6th Cir.  1997).  The material facts concerning the unconstitutionality of the \nDefendants' strip search policy are undisputed.  The Defendants admit that the Jail has a blanket \npolicy of subjecting all detainees transferred from other facilities to an automatic strip search \nupon  admission  to  the  Jail  - regardless  of the  charge  and  regardless  of the  particular \ncircumstances of the detainee.  Indeed, the Defendants admit that they did not even inquire about \nthe circumstances of any individual detainees' transportation to the Jailor prior custody in the \ntransferring facility before determining whether to order a strip search.  Defendants therefore \nhave admitted that detainees transferred from other facilities - including persons charged with \nnon-violent,  non-drug-related  misdemeanor  offenses  - are  routinely  strip  searched  without \nindividualized  suspicion  that  a  particular detainee  is  concealing  contraband.  This  practice \nviolates detainees' clearly established constitutional rights. \nA.  Under clearly established constitutional law, pretrial detainees charged with \nnon-violent,  non-drug  related  misdemeanor  offenses  may  not  be  strip \nsearched absent individualized reasonable suspicion. \n- Courts have repeatedly recognized that \"strip and visual body cavity searches impinge \nseriously upon the values that the Fourth Amendment was meant to protect.\"  Swain v.  Spinney, \n117  F .3d  1,  6 (15t  Cir.  1997).  Strip searches  of pretrial detainees have been described as \n\"demeaning,  dehumanizing,  undignified,  humiliating,  terrifying,  unpleasant,  embarrassing, \nrepulsive, signifying degradation and humiliation.\"  Mary Beth G.  v.  City a/Chicago, 723 F.2d \n1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).  It is therefore well established that \"a strip search is an invasion of \npersonal rights of the first magnitude.\"  Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393,395 (10th Cir. 1993). \nAccordingly, in 1979, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a pretrial detainee has the right \nnot to be strip searched unless the reasonableness of the search is established by \"balancing of \n14 \n\nthe need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" \nBell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,559 (1979). \nApplying this balancing test to strip searches of arrestees charged with non-violent, non-\ndrug-related  misdemeanor offenses,  which  are  not  normally  associated  with  a  high  risk  of \nsmuggling contraband or weapons, \"[t]he decisions of all the federal courts of appeals that have \nconsidered the issue [have] reached the same conclusion: a strip search of a person arrested for a \ntraffic violation or other minor offense not normally associated with violence and concerning \nwhom  there  is  no  individualized  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  arrestee  is  carrying  or \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband, is unreasonable.\" Masters v.  Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, \n1255 (6th Cir. 1989) (emphasis added).4 \nIn Masters v.  Crouch, the Sixth Circuit held that Jefferson County, Kentucky's blanket \npolicy  of strip  searching  all  pretrial  detainees  who  were  transferred  into  the  general  jail \npopulation  violated  the  detainees'  clearly  established  constitutional  rights.

The court relied  on the \nnumerous decisions from other circuits, which found no basis for believing that, as a class, a \nminor offenders charged with non-violent, non-drug-related crimes presented a risk of smuggling \ncontraband.  In the absence of such evidence, \"the only justification for [a blanket] policy was \ninstitutional convenience\" - i.e., that a blanket policy is \"easier to administer than one which \nrequires a balancing of interests in each case and an individual determination of need.\"  Id. at \n1254 (citing Mary Beth G.,  723  F.2d at  1272-73).  The  Sixth Circuit agreed with the other \ncircuits that \"institutional convenience\" was insufficient to justify the intrusion of a strip search \nin the case of minor offenders.  Accordingly, the court held \"[i]t was equally clearly established \nthat a person charged only with a traffic violation or nonviolent minor offense may not be \nsubjected to a strip search unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the particular \nperson might be carrying or concealing weapons or other contraband.\"  Id. at 1257 (emphasis \nadded). \nThus, under Masters, it is clearly unconstitutional to strip search non-violent, non-drug \nrelated offenders upon initial admission to a detention center pursuant to a blanket strip search \npolicy that does not require an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion.  But under the \nJail's blanket policy of strip  searching all  arrestees  transferred  from  other facilities,  that  is \nexactly what happens.  Jailer Lantrip's unequivocal testimony was that all such transferees are \nsearched automatically, regardless of their charges.  [1117/06 Lantrip Dep. at 26.]  Moreover, \nJailer Lantrip readily acknowledged that Jail officers do not make any individualized assessment \nof whether there is a reasonable suspicion that any particular arrestee transferred from another \nfacility is carrying or concealing contraband based on the arrestee's charges, the circumstances \nsurrounding  the  arrestee's  transfer,  or  the  conditions  of the  arrestee's  confinement  in  the \n16 \n\ntransferring facility.  [1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 26-27, 51-53.]  Rather, once it is determined that \nan arrestee has been transferred from another facility, he or she is automatically strip searched \nwithout respect to the circumstances.  [Id.]  This is precisely the kind of blanket strip search \npolicy held unconstitutional in Masters. \nB.  The mere fact that a detainee has been transferred from another facility is \ninsufficient as  a  matter of law to justify a  strip search in the absence of \nindividualized reasonable suspicion. \nDefendants  have  not,  and  cannot,  identify  any  valid  basis  for  concluding  that  the \nindividualized reasonable suspicion requirement of Masters may be abandoned merely because \nan arrestee has been transferred from another facility.  No case law supports such a radical \nconclusion.  Nor is there any other basis in the record for concluding that the well-established \nrule set forth in Masters would not apply in this circumstance.  To the contrary, Defendants' own \nexpert witness flatly  conceded that the mere  fact  that an arrestee has been transferred from \nanother facility, by itself, is insufficient to justify a strip search. \n1.  The case law confirms that arrestees transferred from other facilities \nmay not be strip searched in the absence of individualized reasonable \nsuspicion. \nNo court that has ever found that the mere fact that an arrestee has been transferred from \nanother facility, without more, is sufficient to warrant a strip search at the receiving facility.  To \nthe contrary, courts have consistently held that strip searches of nonviolent, non-drug-related \nminor offenders are unconstitutional in the absence of individualized reasonable suspicion, even \nin circumstances where the searches were conducted following a transfer from another \nfacility.  See,  e.g.,  NG.  v.  State 0/ Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225, 232 (2d Cir. 2004); Shain v. \nEllison, 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001); Dodge v.  County o/Orange, 282 F. Supp. 2d 41 (S.D.N.Y. \n2003);  Lee  v.  Perez,  175  F.  Supp.  2d 673  (S.D.N.Y.  2001)  (unconstitutional to  strip search \n17 \n---------------------- - --\n\narrestee following transport to regional detention center to post bail); Ford v. Suffolk County, 154 \nF. Supp. 2d 131 (D. Mass. 2001).  Accord Jones v.  Edwards, 770 F.2d 739,741 (8th Cir. 1985) \n(noting that circumstances of custody did not establish reasonable suspicion where \"[0 ]fficers \nwere with [plaintiff] every moment after they read him the warrant; they watched him dress and \ngo to the bathroom, thereby eliminating any chance that he might have secreted a weapon on his \nperson\"). \nIn N. G.  v.  State of Connecticut, for example, the court squarely held that strip searches \ncannot be not justified \"simply because of transfers to other facilities.\"  382 F.3d 225,233 (2d \nCir. 2004) (emphasis added).  The court rejected the defendants' contention - which mirrors the \njustification offered by Jailer Lantrip in this case - that strip searches following transfers are \nnecessary \"because it would be  'foolish' to rely on the  searching at  [the prior facility]  and \nbecause contraband might have been picked up during transport.\"  Id at 234 n.12.  According to \nthe court, the mere possibility that contraband could be acquired during a transfer did not justify \na blanket policy of searching all transferees.  Rather, the court concluded that a strip search can \nonly be justified upon examination of the individualized circumstances surrounding the transfer \nof a particular detainee to determine if a reasonable suspicion exists: \nArguably, it was more convenient for the personnel at GDC to strip search S.C. \nupon  her  admission  there,  rather  than  determine  whether  she  had  been  strip \nsearched  upon  her  prior admission  to  NHJDC  and  had  remained  in  custody \nthroughout  the  transfer  process.  Mere  convenience,  however,  cannot  be  a \nsufficient interest to justify such a serious impairment of privacy.  We recognize \nthat unavoidable circumstances might arise, even during a period of continuous \ncustody, that create opportunities for an inmate to acquire contraband, in which \nevent a strip search might well be reasonable.  No such circumstances were shown \nin this case. \nId. at 234.5 \n5 NG. involved strip searches of juveniles upon admission to juvenile detention facility.  The court in \nN G.  held that blanket policies mandating strip searches upon  initial admission to  custody could be \n18 \n\nFord v.  Suffolk County also is squarely on point. 154 F. Supp. 2d 131 (D. Mass. 2001). \nIn Ford,  the court granted partial summary judgment on § 1983  liability to  a plaintiff class \ncomprised of women who were subjected to routine strip searches upon their transfer from City \nof Boston facilities to the Suffolk County jail.  Until May of 1999, the Suffolk Jail had a blanket \npolicy of subjecting all of these female admittees to a routine strip search upon admission to the \njail.  Id. at 135.  See also id. at 133-34.  The court concluded that the policy was unconstitutional \nbecause  \"Jail  officials  made  no  individualized  findings  of reasonable  suspicion  prior  to \nconducting strip searches of BPD [Boston Police Department] arrestees.\"  Id. at 142  (emphasis \nadded).  Although the  class  members  in Ford,  by definition,  had  all  been transferred  from \nanother facility, the court concluded that \"the County cannot reasonably have suspected the \nwomen, as a class, of harboring weapons or contraband at the time of admission.\"  Id. at \n142 (emphasis added).  The court noted that the factual record did not indicate that the BPD's \npractices in transferring detainees to the Suffolk county facility were not secure.  Id.  The court \nconcluded that the defendants  could not constitutionally adopt a blanket strip  search policy \nsimply to  avoid making an individualized assessment of the particular circumstances of each \ntransferee:  \"[a]n indiscriminate strip-search policy routinely applied ... can not be justified \nsimply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.\"  Id.  at 142 \n(quotation omitted). \nSimilarly, in Dodge v.  County of Orange, the court granted a permanent injunction to \nplaintiffs  in  a  strip  search  class  action,  holding  that  it  was  unconstitutional  for  a  county \ncorrectional  facility  to  automatically  strip  search nonviolent  and  non-drug  related  offenders \njustified in the case of juveniles, even though such policies would not be justified for adult offenders, \nbased on the state's special  interest in  detecting physical or sexual abuse.  382  F.3d at 237.  It  is \nsignificant that even though the NG. court recognized a much broader scope of state authority to strip \nsearch juvenile offenders  than  adult  offenders,  the  court still  found  an  insufficient justification for \nsubjecting juveniles to a blanket strip search policy following transfers from other facilities.  Id. at 234. \n19 \n\nfollowing their remand to county facility from other law enforcement agencies or correctional \nfacilities.  282 F. Supp. 2d 41 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).  The plaintiffs in Dodge were all remanded to the \ncounty  facility  from  other  facilities  while  awaiting  trial  or  the  posting  of bail.  Id.  The \nDefendants  in  Dodge  defended  their policy  with  the  same  institutional  security  arguments \noffered by Jailer Lantrip - i.e., that \"no prudent correctional administrator could safely rely on \nsecurity precautions taken by other law enforcement agencies, or even correctional facilities that \nmay have had custody of the inmate before he or she arrived at OCCF.\"  Id. at 47.  The Dodge \ncourt nonetheless found that a blanket policy of strip searching all  arrestees admitted to  the \nfacility  plainly violated  the  established  law that  \"persons  charged  with  a misdemeanor and \nremanded to a local correctional facility have a right to be free of a strip search absent reasonable \nsuspicion that they are carrying contraband.\" Id. at 82. \nThe Dodge court followed the Second Circuit's decision in Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56 \n(2d Cir. 2001), which reached the same conclusion on similar facts.  In Shain, as in the Dodge \ncase, the plaintiff was strip searched pursuant to a blanket policy requiring strip searches of all \narrestees  remanded to  the  custody  of a  county  correctional  facility  by  a court.  The  court \nconcluded that \"it was clearly established in 1995 [the time of the searches] that persons charged \nwith a misdemeanor and remanded to a local correctional facility like NCCC have a right to be \nfree of a strip search absent reasonable suspicion that they are carrying contraband or weapons.\" \nId. at 66.  Shain acknowledged that particular circumstances in an individual detainee's custodial \nhistory might create reasonable suspicion - \"for example, a person who is allowed to visit the \nbathroom unescorted\" - but concluded that \"the remand  [to the county correctional facility] \ncould not provide reasonable and individualized suspicion.\" Id. at 64, 66. \n20 \n\nThe teaching of these cases is clear.  The fact of an institutional transfer, without more, \ndoes not warrant abandoning minor offenders' rights not to be strip searched in the absence of \nindividualized  reasonable  suspicion.  In  this  case,  Jailer  Lantrip  admits  that  no  such \nindividualized assessment was made before ordering a strip search of institutional transferees. \nInstead, arrestees transferred from other facilities were subject to an \"automatic\" strip search, \nregardless of the circumstances surrounding their prior custody or transfer.  This blanket policy \nis plainly unconstitutional. \n2.  The Jail's blanket strip search policy is  not based on  any specific \nfactual  basis  for  suspecting institutional transferees,  as  a  class,  of \nharboring contraband. \nIn invalidating blanket strip search policies for detainees transferred from other facilities, \ncourts have emphasized the absence any factual basis for suspecting institutional transferees, as a \nclass, of harboring contraband.  See, e.g., Ford, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 142.  Accord Mary Beth G., \n723 F.2d at 1272 (citing absence of any factual basis for finding that minor offenders, as a class, \nwere likely to harbor contraband in invalidating blanket strip search policy for all  incoming \narrestees).  The record in this case provides no reason to doubt these decisions.  To the contrary, \nDefendants concede that the Jail's blanket strip search policy was not based on any particular \nfacts known to the Defendants about the security practices involved in transferring detainees to \nthe Hopkins County Jail.  And the Defendants' own records fail to show a heightened risk of \nharboring contraband among detainees transferred from  other facilities.  Indeed, Defendants' \nown expert concedes that a detainee may not be strip searched merely because he was transferred \nfrom  another  facility.  The  only justification  offered  by  the  Defendants  for  searching  all \ntransferees, regardless of their individual circumstances, is the fact that the Defendants lacked \n21 \n\n-------------------. \n----\ninformation to evaluate the security risk presented by any particular transferee.  This justification \nis insufficient as a matter of law. \nInitially, it is uncontested that the Jail's blanket strip search policy was not based on any \nfacts known to the Defendants about the security practices involved in transporting arrestees to \nthe Hopkins County Jail.  To the contrary, Jailer Lantrip candidly admitted that he knew \"very \nlittle\" about these practices.  [1/17/06 Lantrip Dep. at 51.]  Jailer Lantrip further conceded \"I \ndon't think we  ever did\" ask about the  circumstances  surrounding transfers to  the  Hopkins \nCounty Jail to  determine if a detainee had the  opportunity to  conceal contraband.  [1117/06 \nLantrip Dep. at 52.] 6 \nAdditionally,  the  Defendants'  own  records  belie  any  suggestion  that  institutional \ntransferees as a class are more likely to be concealing contraband.  Of the 1159 recorded strip \nsearches that were ordered over the past three  years on the  basis of \"transfer from  another \nfacility,\" all but six produced negative results. [Thacker Aff. ~ 6 (attached as Exh. H).] Thus, an \n6 The deposition testimony of the Named Plaintiffs also refutes any suggestion that transferees, as a class, \nwere uniformly transferred under circumstances that would create security concerns.  Ms.  Ford,  for \nexample, testified that she had already been strip searched at the transferring facility, and was taken into \ncustody and transferred to the Hopkins County Jail immediately upon her release.  [Ford Dep. at 18-22.] \nSee generally Ford, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 142 (fact that some plaintiffs had already been strip searched at \ntransferring  facility  defeated  claim  that transferees,  as  a  class,  presented  heightened  security  risk). \nLikewise, Ms. Nelson testified that on the three occasions she was transferred from the Caldwell County \nJail to the Hopkins County Jail, she was never \"booked in\" to the general population at the Caldwell Jail, \nand merely waited 2-3 hours at the Caldwell facility until she could be transported to Hopkins County. \n[Nelson Dep. at 20-22.]  According to Defendants' expert, Mr. Sabbatine, this kind of circumstance - i.e., \nwhere \"the person did not go  beyond the booking area of the  [transferring]  facility and then  [was] \ntransferred to the second jail\" - would not \"give me reason to be concerned about the presence of a \ncontraband for an otherwise nonstrippable offender.\"  [12/5/05  Sabbatine Dep.  at 67-68.]  Sabbatine \nexplained that under these circumstances, there is no basis for differentiating a transferee from \"a person \nbeing arrested, taken to the police station for interview, and then dropped off at the jail.\"  [Id. at 67-68.] \nPlaintiff May similarly testified that he was arrested in Webster County and placed immediately into a \nholding cell, where he remained until his transfer.  May testified that he was taken \"directly from the hole, \nthe holding cell to the Hopkins County Jail. ... And they ran about a hundred miles an hour all the way to \nthe [Hopkins County] jail.\"  [May Dep. at 27-28.]  May further testified that the Webster County officers \nsearched his clothes and performed a pat down immediately before his transfer to the Hopkins County \nJail.  [May Dep. at 29-30.] \n22 \n\ninfinitesimal 0.51768 % of strip searches of arrestees transferred from other facilities generated \nany kind of positive result.  And in five of these cases, the only contraband found was cigarettes \nor tobacco-related items.7  [Id.  at ~ 6.]  See,  e.g., Mary Beth G., 723  F.2d at 1272 (affirming \nsummary judgment and rejecting proffered jail security justification where \"only a few items \nhave been recovered from  the  body cavities of women arrested  on minor charges  over the \nyears\"); Ford, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 142 (granting summary judgment, finding no reasonable basis \nfor  concluding  that  transferees,  as  a  class,  were  likely  to  be  concealing  contraband  where \ncontraband was found in less than one percent of searches). \nMoreover, Defendants' own expert witness conceded that the mere fact that a detainee \nwas transferred from another facility is not sufficient to warrant a strip search \"in the absence of \nother factors that would justify the search.\"  [12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. at 70-71 (attached as Exh. \nF).]  Mr. Sabbatine, who offered an expert opinion concerning the \"State and Federal standards \nof care\" regarding strip search policies and practices, testified that a decision to strip search an \narrestee upon transfer to the second facility could only be made after examination of the \"full \ncircumstance of the custodial happenings in the initial facility.\"  [12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. at 68.] \nThe mere fact that an arrestee had been transferred from another facility, according to Sabbatine, \n\"doesn't give me enough information to draw a  conclusion that would satisfy me as to \nwhether or not the  person was  likely  to  be  strippable when  they  entered  the  second \nfacility.\"  [12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep. at 69 (emphasis added).] \nPlaintiffs'  expert,  Gordon Kamka,  was  of the  same  view:  \"[a]  strip search due to \ntransfer form another correctional facility cannot be justified for security reasons ....\"  \n[8/30/05 PIs. Tender ofSupp. Expert Op. (emphasis added).] \nThe only information shown in the sixth case were the words \"code 4.\"  There is no explanation' in \n7 \nDefendants' records of what \"code 4\" stands for. \n23 \n\nThe only justification offered for the Jail's policy was Jailer Lantrip's testimony that he \ncannot have  confidence  in the  security of any  transfer because  he  has  \"no  idea\"  about the \nsecurity conditions in the transferring jail or \"where they stopped en route to our jail, who \nthey've had contact with, those type things.\"  [1117/06 Lantrip Dep. at 26.] \nBut Jailer Lantrip's unspecified and unsubstantiated concerns about security practices \ninvolved in institutional transfers is insufficient, as a matter of law, to justify a blanket policy  of \nstrip searching all arrestees transferred from other facilities.  Indeed, the Second Circuit in N G. \nrejected an identical justification offered by the defendants in that case, who claimed in would be \n\"foolish\" to rely on the  security practices at other facilities  or the transferring officers who \npreviously had custody of a detainee.  382.F.3d at 234 n.l2.  Similarly, the Dodge the court held \na blanket strip search policy for  institutional transferees  unconstitutional  despite defendants' \nclaim that \"no prudent correction administrator could safely rely on security precautions taken by \nother law enforcement agencies ...t hat may have had custody of the inmate before he or she \narrived.\"  282 F. Supp. 2d at 47. \nReasonable suspicion to justify a strip search must be based on information \"known to \nthe officer at the time of the search.\"  Thompson v.  County o/Cook, 408 F. Supp. 2d 807, 2006 \nU.S. Dist LEXIS 26155, at *18-19 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (citing Kaniffv. United States, 351 F.3d 780, \n785 (7th Cir. 2003»  (emphasis in original).8  Here, the decision to search was not based on any \nfacts known to Jail staff at the time of the searches that indicated a risk of contraband.  Rather, \nthe blanket strip search policy was put in place because the Jail staff simply did not know the \nfacts necessary to determine whether a security risk existed.  But \"Defendants have not explained \nnor cited cases for the somewhat remarkable proposition that the lack of information can create \n8 See also generally Maryland v . Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 85 (1987) (constitutionality of search must be \njudged \"in light of the information available to [the officers] at the time they acted\"). \n24 \n\na reasonable suspicion.\"  Id  at *20 (emphasis added).  Indeed, a rule holding that the mere \nabsence of information is sufficient to justify a strip search would \"encourage officers and jailers \nto deliberately refrain\" from obtaining the information necessary to make reliable individualized \nrisk assessments.  Id. \nThe fact that the Jail's blanket strip search policy is not based on any actual knowledge \nabout the specific security practices involved in transferring arrestees, or particular facts about \nthe circumstances of any individual transfers, \"demonstrate[s] that the only justification for the \npolicy  [is]  institutional  convenience\"  - i.e.,  that  a  policy  of strip  searching  all  detainees \ntransferred from another facility \"is easier to administer than one which requires a balancing of \ninterests in each case and an individual determination of need.\"  Masters,  872 F.2d at  1254 \n(citing Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73)).  The Sixth Circuit, along with all other courts to \nhave  considered the  issue,  has  clearly held that institutional convenience  is  not a sufficient \ninterest to justify a blanket strip search policy.  Id.  Put simply, \"[a]n indiscriminate strip search \npolicy  routinely  applied  .  .  .  cannot  be  constitutionally  justified  simply  on  the  basis  of \nadministrative ease.\"  Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013. \nIn  sum,  the  Defendants'  blanket  policy  of individually  strip  searching  all  detainees \ntransferred  from  other  facilities  plainly  violates  pretrial  detainees'  clearly  established \nconstitutional rights.  Every court that has considered the issue has agreed that the fact of an \ninstitutional transfer, by itself, does not justify a strip search in the absence of individualized \nreasonable  suspicion.  Even  Defendants'  own  expert  witness  concedes  this  point.  And \nDefendants have  conceded that in the  case  of institutional transfers,  they  did not make  the \ninquiries necessary to  make an individualized determination of whether reasonable suspicion \nexisted.  Thus, any class members strip searched pursuant to the Defendants' policy have been \n25 \n\nsubjected  to  an  unconstitutional  search,  and  are  entitled  to  partial  summary  judgment \nestablishing Defendants' liability for their § 1983 claims. \nII.  Hopkins County is  liable, as  a matter of law, for unconstitutional strip searches \nconducted pursuant to the Jail's official policy of automatically strip searching all \ndetainees  transferred  from  another  facility  without  individualized  reasonable \nsuspicion. \nPlaintiffs are also entitled to a partial summary judgment finding that Hopkins County is \nliable for unconstitutional strip searches conducted pursuant to the Jail's blanket strip search \npolicy for institutional transferees. \nIn Monell v.  Department of Social Services, the  Supreme Court squarely held that a \nmunicipal entity will be liable under 28 U.S.C. § 1983 when the defendant's \"official policy is \nresponsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution.\"  436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978). \nA municipal defendant's official policy may be evinced through formal enactments, such as  \"a \npolicy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that \nbody's officers,\" or by an established practice that \"[a]1though not authorized by written law, ... \nis so permanent and well settled as to constitute a 'custom or usage'  with the force of law.\" \nCash  v.  Hamilton  County Dept.  of Adult Probation,  388  F.3d  539,  542-43  (6th  Cir.  2004) \n(quotations omitted).  See also City ofSt. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 121 (1988); Monell, \n436 U.S. at 691. \nHere, there is no dispute it was the official policy at the Jail to require strip searches of all \ndetainees transferred from other facilities.

F);  12/5/05 Sabbatine Dep., Exhibit 7, August 30, 2005, Soyer Letter (attached \nas Exh. G) (\"The jail does have a policy of strip-searching inmates upon transfer from another \nfacility.\").  Under Monell,  therefore, Hopkins  County is  liable  for  the unconstitutional  strip \nsearches caused by this policy. \nCourts have routinely held municipal defendants liable for unconstitutional strip searches \nunder comparable circumstances.9  In Weber v.  Dell, for example, the Second Circuit found that \nthe county defendant was liable under Monell for an unconstitutional strip search where \"the \nCounty and the  Sheriff conceded[d] that pursuant to jail policy a jail employee undertook a \nstrip/body cavity search of Mrs. Weber after her arrest on misdemeanor charges in the absence of \nany ground other than her status as an arrested person for concluding that she was likely to be \nconcealing contraband.\"  804 F.2d 796, 798, 802 (2d Cir. 1986). \nAlso  illustrative is Blihovde v.  St.  Croix County,  219 F.R.D.  607  (W.D.  Wis.  2003), \nwhich involved a class action alleging illegal strip search policies at a county jail.  Based upon \ndefendants' testimony concerning the practices at the jail, the court found that the jail custom \nwas to search all incoming inmates without regard to reasonable suspicion.  The court found this \ntestimony established the county's liability under Monell, noting that \"even when there is no \nexpress policy, a municipality may be liable when there is a custom of unconstitutional conduct.\" \nId.at618. \n9 See, e.g., Wachtler v. County a/Herkimer, 35 FJd 77, 82 (2d Cir. 1994) (holding that liability of county \nwould be established if \"standard procedures for admitting a person to the jail . . . included routine strip \nsearches of misdemeanor arrestees, absent reasonable suspicion of weapons or contraband\"); 0 'Brien v. \nBorough  0/ Woodbury  Heights,  679  F.  Supp.  429,  434-35  (D.N.J.  1988)  (county  held  liable  for \nunconstitutional strip search where \"Defendants ... concede that it is the policy of the Gloucester County \nJail to strip search all inmates regardless of the charge.\"); Davis v. City a/Camden, 657 F. Supp. 396,402 \n(D.N.J.  1987) (requirements for municipal liability satisfied where county \"admitted that the Camden \nCounty Sheriffs Office maintained a policy of having an officer oftIle same sex strip search any person \nunable to post bail\"). \n27 \n\nIII.  Plaintiffs are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief. \nThis Court should also preliminarily enjoin the Defendants from continuing to enforce \ntheir blanket policy of strip  searching  all  arrestees  transferred  from  other facilities  without \nreasonable suspicion that a particular detainee is concealing contraband or weapons.  There are \nabsolutely no factual disputes - the existence and nature of the Jail's blanket strip search policy \nis undisputed.  This policy is unconstitutional as a matter of law.  An oral hearing is therefore \nunnecessary,  and the Court should enter the  requested preliminary injunction without delay. \nUnited States v.  McGhee, 714 F.2d 607, 612 (6th Cir. 1983) (evidentiary hearing is not required \nwhen motion for preliminary injunction presents \"no triable issues of fact\"). \n\"A district court must consider four factors when determining whether to grant or deny a \npreliminary injunction:  (1) the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the \nplaintiff may suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction; (3) whether granting the injunction \nwill  cause  substantial  harm to  others;  and  (4)  the  impact of an  injunction upon the  public \ninterest.\" Deja vu of Nashville,  Inc.  v.  Metro.  Gov't of Nashville, 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th  Cir. \n2001). \nIn cases based on government violations of individuals' constitutional rights, a sufficient \nshowing of likelihood of success will often be decisive.  As the Sixth Circuit has noted, \"when \nreviewing a motion for a preliminary injunction, if it is found that a constitutional right is being \nthreatened or impaired, a finding of irreparable injury is mandated.\" ACLU v. McCreary County, \n354 F.3d 438,445 (6th Cir. 2003).  \"In other words, the first factor of the four-factor preliminary \ninjunction inquiry--whether the plaintiff shows  a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the \nmerits--should be addressed first insofar as a successful showing on the first factor mandates a \nsuccessful showing on the second factor--whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm.\"  Id. \n28 \n\nLikewise,  \"it is  always  in the  public interest to  prevent violation of a party's  constitutional \nrights.\" G & V Lounge, Inc.  v.  Michigan Liquor Control Comm'n, 23 F.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. \n1994).  And  \"if the  plaintiff  shows  a  substantial  likelihood  that  the  challenged  law  is \nunconstitutional, no substantial harm to others can be said to inhere in its enjoinment.\"  Deja vu \no/Nashville, Inc., 274 F.3d at 400. \nAs  explained fully  in Part I,  supra,  Defendants'  blanket policy of strip  searching all \npretrial detainees transferred from other facilities without individualized suspicion is patently \nunconstitutional  on  its  face  and  has  caused,  and  continues  to  cause,  repeated  violations  of \narrestees' constitutional rights.  The unconstitutionality of this policy is indisputable.  Plaintiffs \nhave therefore demonstrated both a strong likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable \nharm.  See Dodge v.  County o/Orange, 282 F.  Supp. 2d 41, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (holding that \ncourt's determination that blanket strip search policy was  unconstitutional  was  sufficient to \ndemonstrate requisite irreparable harm for preliminary injunction). \nMoreover,  the  undisputed  factual  record  in  this  case  confirms  that  a  preliminary \ninjunction will promote the public interest, and not cause undue harm to the Defendants' interest \nin jail security.  Indeed, Defendants' own expert conceded that the mere fact that an arrestee has \nbeen transferred from another facility does not present a heightened security risk, in the absence \nof other factors  suggesting the transferee had an opportunity to  conceal contraband.  [12/5/05 \nSabbatine Dep. at  67-68.]  Thus, Defendants have no demonstrated need to search every single \ndetainee transferred from another facility, regardless of the specific circumstances surrounding a \nparticular detainee. \nAdditionally, the fact that the strip searches of only six of the 1159 detainees transferred \nfrom other facilities generated any kind of positive results - and in five of these instances the \n29 \n\n-------------------------------, \n10 \nonly results reported were a finding of cigarettes or related items, such as matches - clearly \ndemonstrates that ceasing blanket strip searches of these arrestees will not result in a substantial \nincrease in the amount of contraband brought into the Jail.  [B. Thacker Aff. ~ 6 (attached as \nExh. H).]  Indeed, it is not clear from the Jail's records whether a strip search was necessary to \ndetect the contraband, even in those six instances.  The Jail's records do  not show whether \ncontraband was concealed in a place that would only be located during a strip search, such as a \nbodily orifice, or whether it was located in a place, such as an arrestee's clothing, where it could \nhave been discovered during a simple pat down search or through a search of the detainee's \nclothing after the detainee donned a jail uniform. \nMoreover, the Jail can protect its institutional security interests by taking the necessary \nsteps  to  identify  and  search  those  particular  offenders  who,  because  of their  individual \ncircumstances, may pose a security risk.  See, e.g., Giles v.  Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 618 (9th \nCir.  1984); Dodge, 282 F.  Supp. 2d at 88 (rejecting claim that it is \"impossible\" for booking \nofficers to make individualized assessment of reasonable suspicion upon each detainee's transfer \nto  county correctional  facility).  And \"[o]f course,  the  County remains  free  to  enhance  its \nsecurity by implementation of procedures that are less intrusive than strip searches, including the \nuse of pat down searches and metal detectors ....\"   Giles, 746 F .2d at 618 (affirming injunction \nagainst blanket strip search policy). \nFinally, in assessing the possible hardship to the Defendants, the Court must consider that \nif the Defendants continue to follow their blanket strip  search policy,  they will continue to \nexpose themselves to additional § 1983  claims for punitive and compensatory damages from \nIn the sixth instance, the only result reported was \"code 4.\"  Defendants' records do not explain what \n10 \n\"code 4\" means. \n30 \n\ndetainees sUbjected to unconstitutional strip searches.  The Dodge court cited a similar concern \nin granting injunctive relief in that case: \nI note that defendants would suffer similar hardship even if I did not enter an \ninjunction.  . . . OCCF  would expose itself to  punitive damages in individual \nSection 1983 actions if it reverted to its past policy of strip searching all arrestees. \nOf course, one of the functions of punitive damages is to force a party to comply \nwith the law.  Thus, there exists a distinct possibility that OFFC would suffer the \nsame hardship regardless of whether I issue an injunction. \nSee Dodge, 282 F. Supp. 2d at 139. \nIn sum, all factors weigh in favor of granting preliminary injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs' \nmotion for a preliminary injunction should therefore be granted. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the  foregoing  reasons,  Plaintiffs'  motions for partial  summary judgment and for \npreliminary injunctive relief should be GRANTED. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nJj \nGregory  .

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs have filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and a Preliminary \nInjunction claiming that Hopkins County Jail’s (hereafter “Jail”) former procedure of \nstrip searching those inmates who were transferred from another county jail is \nunconstitutional.  It is Defendants’ position that the procedure was in fact constitutional \nand in accordance with Kentucky’s Administrative Regulations.  As such, Defendants \n  1\n\nrequest that this Court deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and \nPreliminary Injunction.  In the alternative, Defendants have filed a Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment, asking this Court to find that the former procedure is constitutional \nand to dismiss those Plaintiffs and/or Class Members that were strip searched pursuant to \nthis procedure.  \nII.  COUNTER-STATEMENT OF FACTS \n  It is undisputed that, until recently, the Jail had a procedure of strip searching \ninmates who were transferred from another jail.  (See Affidavit of Chris Fields, attached \nhereto as Exhibit “A”).  However, in light of this suit, on May 25, 2006, the Jail adopted \na more conservative strip search procedure which now only allows a strip search of a \ntransfer from another facility if the criminal charges (past or present) invoke reasonable \nsuspicion or of course, unless they fit into some other category.1  (See Affidavit of Chris \nFields).   \n  Plaintiffs incorrectly state that “the decision to strip search an arrestee is made \nbefore obtaining a criminal history report on the subject.” In fact, the Jail maintains a \ncriminal history report in their computer system for every person arrested and booked \ninto the Hopkins County Jail.  When a person is brought into the jail, whether as an initial \narrestee or a transfer from another institution, that person’s criminal history in Hopkins \nCounty is reviewed to determine if his/her criminal history would invoke reasonable \nsuspicion to strip search.  (See Lantrip Depo., p. 14, attached hereto as Exhibit “B”) (“[I]f \nthey’ve been arrested in our jail and brought to our jail, booked in before, it would show \ntheir previous arrests in the computer.”).  Furthermore, during the booking process, the \n                                                 \n1 It should be noted that Defendants changed this portion of the strip search procedure pursuant to the \nundersigned’s advice that because no court has ruled on this issue, they should refrain from strip searching \npersons upon transfer from another jail until this Court can address the issue.   \n  2\n\ninmate is asked about his criminal history.  (Lantrip depo., p. 16, attached hereto as \nExhibit “B”).    \nAccordingly, even if the Jail did not previously have a procedure of strip \nsearching every inmate upon transfer from another facility, it is likely that an inmate \nmight be strip searched for any number of other reasons, such as current or past criminal \ncharges, refusing to submit to a pat down search, identified as a suicide risk, or other \ncircumstances that would invoke reasonable suspicion. \n  The Jail implemented the former procedure on transfers because such an inmate \nwas exposed to areas to which the public had access before and/or during the transfer, \nincreasing the likelihood that the inmate could possess contraband (weapons, drugs, \ncigarettes, etc.).  The procedure was implemented in light of the following language in \nthe Kentucky Administrative Regulations: \n  (b) A prisoner may be strip searched only on reasonable suspicion . . . .  \nReasonable suspicion shall be based upon one (1) or more of the \nfollowing:    \n \n1.  A current offense involving felony violence, drug charges, or \nfugitive status; \n2.  A criminal history of offenses involving the use of a weapon or the \npossession of contraband; \n3.  Institutional behavior, reliable information, or history that indicates \npossession or manufacturing of contraband, the refusal to submit to \na clothed pat down search, or a clothed pat down search reveals the \npossession of contraband; \n4.  Contact with the public by a contact visit, court appearance that \ntakes place in an area to which the public may have access, or after \ntransport from or through an area to which the public may have \naccess; or \n5.  The court has ordered commitment to custody after arraignment, \nconviction, sentencing, or other court appearance, and the prisoner \nwas not in custody prior to the court appearance.     \n \n501 KAR 3:120(3)(b) (emphasis added) (attached hereto as Exhibit “C”).   \n  3\n\nIII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Because the procedure is no longer in effect, this Court cannot declare \nit unconstitutional. \n \nPlaintiffs request an order from this Court declaring the procedure of strip \nsearching inmates following transfer to unconstitutional.  However, this Court is barred \nfrom doing so under the circumstances.  In Brandywine, Inc. v. City of Richmond, Ky, \nthe Sixth Circuit was asked to declare the City’s zoning ordinance as it applied to \nBrandywine, Inc., an adult bookstore, unconstitutional.  359 F.3d 830 (6th Cir. 2004).  \nAfter suit was filed, Richmond amended the ordinance, effectively repealing the \nprovision that prohibited Brandywine, Inc. from operating where it was located.  Id. at \n833-34.  The Sixth Circuit held that “[w]e can neither declare unconstitutional nor enjoin \nthe enforcement of a provision that is no longer in effect.”  Id. at 836.   \nAs stated previously, the Defendants have amended the procedure at issue such \nthat persons who are transferred from other detention facilities are only strip searched if \ntheir past or current criminal charges invoke reasonable suspicion or if they fit into one of \nthe other categories listed in this procedure that mandate a strip search.  (See Exhibit \n“A”).  As such, the challenged procedure “is no longer in effect.”  Pursuant to the dictates \nof the Sixth Circuit, as a result, this Court cannot declare the procedure unconstitutional.  \nDefendants request that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment be denied.    \nB.  Defendants are nevertheless entitled to a ruling that their past \npractice was constitutional in accordance with the Supreme Court’s \nrulings on these issues.   \n     \n  Any analysis of a strip search policy must start with a consideration of the seminal \nU.S. Supreme Court case on the subject, Bell v. Wolfish. 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  In \nreviewing the many constitutional claims in that case, the Supreme Court recognized that: \n  4\n\nThe problems that arise in the day-to-day operation of a corrections \nfacility are not susceptible of easy solutions.  Prison administrators \ntherefore should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and \nexecution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to \npreserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional \nsecurity.  Such considerations are peculiarly within the province and \nprofessional expertise of corrections officials, and, in the absence of \nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have \nexaggerated their response to these considerations, courts should \nordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters. \n \nId. at 547-58.  \n \n  In Bell, the Court was asked to consider whether a strip search of every jail \ninmate following a contact visit was constitutional where there was no reasonable belief \nto indicate that the inmate was concealing contraband.  In that case, the Court employed \nthe following balancing test:   \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of \nprecise definition or mechanical application.  In each case it requires a \nbalancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of \npersonal rights that the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of \nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.   \n \nId. at 559.  The Court further noted that “[a] detention facility is a unique place fraught \nwith serious security dangers.  Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other \ncontraband is all too common an occurrence.”  Id.  In addition, the Court stated that the \nfact that only one inmate had been “discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the \ninstitution on his person may be more a testament to the effectiveness of this search \ntechnique as a deterrent than to a lack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and \nimport such items when the opportunity arises.”  After balancing the significant and \nlegitimate security interests of the institution in strip searching all inmates following a \ncontact visit with the privacy interests of the inmates, the Court determined that the strip \n  5\n\nsearches of inmates following contact visits were lawful.  Id.   \n  In 1987, the Supreme Court was again faced with a constitutional challenge to \nprison administration policies and rules in Turner v. Safley.  482 U.S. 78 (1987).  \nAlthough this case did not involve a challenge to a strip search policy, the Court did \nhowever, again discuss a court’s role in considering a constitutional challenge to a \nprison’s policies and procedures and the type of scrutiny that should be undertaken.  The \nTurner Court recognized that “courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent \nproblems of prison administration and reform.”  Id. at 84 (quoting Procunier v. \nMartinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974).  The Court further stated that: \nRunning a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires \nexpertise, planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are \npeculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of \ngovernment.  Prison administration is, moreover, a task that has been \ncommitted to the responsibility of those branches, and separation of \npowers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint.  \n \nId. at 85.   \n  The Court then discussed the proper standard of review in cases involving \nquestions of prisoners’ rights.  In doing so, the Court held that the test is not one of strict \nscrutiny but is as follows:  “when a prison regulation impinges on inmates’ constitutional \nrights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological \ninterests.”  Id. at 89.  For purposes of determining whether the regulation is reasonable, \nthe Court set forth four factors to be considered:  First, “there must be a ‘valid, rational \nconnection’ between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put \nforward to justify it.”  Id. at 89-90 (quoting Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984)).  \nSecond, the Court must consider the existence of alternative means for inmates to \nexercise their constitutional rights.  In considering this factor, “courts should be \n  6\n\nparticularly conscious of the ‘measure of judicial deference owed to corrections officials . \n. . in gauging the validity of the regulation.’”  Id. at 89-90 (and Jones v. North Carolina \nPrisoners’ Union, 433 U.S. 119 (1977)).  Third, courts must consider the impact that \naccommodation of these constitutional rights may have on other guards and inmates, and \non the allocation of prison resources.   And fourth, the absence of ready alternatives is \nevidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation.   \nThis is not a ‘least restrictive alternative’ test:  prison officials do not have \nto set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of \naccommodating the claimant’s constitutional complaint.  But if an inmate \ncan point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner’s rights at \nde minimis cost to valid penological interests, a court may consider that as \nevidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship \nstandard.         \n \nId. at 90-91.  In Cornwell v. Dahlberg, the Sixth Circuit reversed a lower court’s ruling \nin a strip search case for failing to take into consideration the four Turner factors.  963 \nF.2d 912 (6th Cir. 1992).   \n  Plaintiffs cite Masters v. Crouch, a Sixth Circuit opinion, which held that “a strip \nsearch of a person arrested for a traffic violation or other minor offense not normally \nassociated with violence and concerning whom there is no individualized reasonable \nsuspicion that the arrestee is carrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband, is \nunreasonable.”  872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989).  However, the reasoning in Masters \nis inapplicable to this case, since the search in Masters was part of the initial booking \nprocedure following the prisoner’s arrest.  Defendants’ policy is in accordance with this \nruling.  It allows a strip search of a person who is arrested and initially brought to the \nHopkins County Jail only if they have past or present drug charges or past or present \nweapons charges or if some other factors invoke reasonable suspicion.  As such, their \n  7\n\npolicy is in conformance with the Masters’ holding.  (See Old and New Policies, attached \nto Chris Fields’ Affidavit, attached hereto as Exhibit “A”).   \n  Defendants’ procedure at issue herein is not a blanket policy of strip searching all \ninmates as was addressed in Masters.  Rather, Plaintiffs challenge the Jail’s procedure of \nstrip searching only those inmates who were arrested in a county outside of Hopkins \nCounty, held in a detention facility there, and then transported (within a few hours, days, \nweeks, months, or even years) to the Hopkins County Jail on charges pending in Hopkins \nCounty.  The “legitimate penological” reasons for strip searching those inmates are the \nfact that, during their previous incarceration and/or transport to Hopkins County, they \nwere in “areas to which the public may have access.”  501 KAR 3:120(3)(b).  As such, \nthese inmates are different from those that are strip searched during the initial booking \nprocess following arrest, as those persons, prior to their arrest, did not know they were \ngoing to jail and therefore did not have sufficient time, nor an opportunity to access areas \nwhere contraband could be found.  In other words, in situations such as those posed in \nMasters, the deterrent rationale for the Bell search is simply less relevant given the \nessentially unplanned nature of the arrest and subsequent incarceration.  See Giles v. \nAckerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984) (overruled on other grounds).          \nIn light of these concerns, courts in this circuit have consistently held that inmates \nwho leave the confines of a Jail may be subjected to strip searches upon their return \nwithout regard to their criminal charges or history given the time and opportunity such \ninmates have for obtaining and/or hiding contraband.  In Richerson v. Lexington Fayette \nUrban County Gov’t, Judge Forester held that where inmates are allowed to leave a jail \nfacility for purposes of a court appearance and therefore have access to areas to which the \n  8\n\npublic also has access, “a policy of strip searching the detainees upon their return from \nthe courthouse and prior to being placed back in the general population of the detention \ncenter is both justified and reasonable.”  958 F.Supp. 299, 307 (E.D. Ky. 1996).  Whether \nthere was individualized reasonable suspicion was irrelevant to that Court’s ruling.     \nIn 1993, the Sixth Circuit (in an unpublished opinion, attached hereto as Exhibit \n“D”), held that, regardless of the criminal charges or whether there is individualized \nreasonable suspicion, a “prison regulation of requiring strip searches  . . . before and after \nappointments scheduled outside the prison is justifiable and is not an exaggerated \nresponse to prison concerns.”  Mowatt v.  Visser, 14 F.3d 602 (6th Cir. 1993).   \nAgain, in an unpublished opinion, in the case of Black v. Franklin County, \nKentucky (attached hereto as Exhibit “E”), Judge Hood dismissed claims of inmates who \nalleged an unlawful strip search after returning to jail from work release and after \nreturning to jail from court appearances (even though they had been under the \nsupervision of the jail employees the entire time), determining that such searches were \nreasonable.  2005 WL 1993445 (E.D. Ky. 2005). \nOther Circuits agree.  In Goff v. Nix, the Eighth Circuit held that visual body \ncavity searches by prison officials before and after visits to the prison infirmary, which \nwas located outside the secure walls of the main prison, was not a violation of the Fourth \nAmendment.  803 F.2d 358 (8th Cir. 1987).  In that case, the prisoners were in restraints \nand under constant supervision the entire time that they were in the infirmary.  \nNevertheless, the Court held that “prison officials have legitimate security concerns due \nto the availability of weapons and because the infirmary is not as secure as most other \nportions of the institution.”  Id. at 369.  Further, the Eighth Circuit recognized that the \n  9\n\n“medical personnel at the infirmary are provided under contract and may not be as \nsensitive to security precautions as the prison administrators would desire.”  Id.  In \naddition, the Eighth Circuit held that strip searches following court appearances did not \nviolate the Fourth Amendment.  Id.  \nSimilarly, in Michenfelder v. Sumner, the Ninth Circuit held that a strip search \npolicy that required a visual body cavity search every time the prisoner left or returned to \nhis cell, as well as after movement under escort was reasonably related to the prison’s \nlegitimate penological interests and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  860 F.2d 328 \n(9th Cir. 1988).   \nIn Peckham v. Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections, the Seventh Circuit held that a \nprison’s policy of strip searching an inmate following a court appearance, medical \nappointment, or a contact visit did not violate the inmate’s constitutional rights.  141 F.3d \n694 (7th Cir. 1998).  The inmates’ criminal histories were irrelevant.   \nIn Dougherty v. Harris, the Tenth Circuit held that a prison’s policy of strip \nsearching inmates following court appearances was constitutional.  476 F.2d 292 (10th \nCir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 872 (1973).   \nAlso, in Arruda v. Fair, the First Circuit held that the prison’s policy of strip \nsearching inmates when they left and re-entered their cell following a visit to the prison \nlaw library and infirmary did not violate the Fourth or Eighth Amendments.  710 F.2d \n886 (1st Cir. 1983).  This was true even though guards accompanied the inmate to and \nfrom the library and infirmary. \nThus, numerous federal courts from several circuits have recognized the \nlegitimate security interests of a jail in strip searching inmates coming from places not \n  10\n\nsecured by jail personnel, including less secure areas of a detention facility.  Consistent \nwith these decisions, and as will be discussed in more detail, a jail has a legitimate \nsecurity concern when receiving transfers from other detention facilities over which the \njail has no control and who may have been in areas accessible to the public.   \nC.  Applying the Supreme Court’s tests to the facts of this case, \nDefendants’ former strip search policy of persons transported to the \nHopkins County Detention Center from other detention facilities is \nconstitutional.  \n \nApplying the Bell v. Wolfish and Turner v. Safely tests, it is without a doubt that \nthe Defendants’ former procedure of strip searching those inmates that are transferred \nfrom other detention facilities is constitutional.  The Bell test requires this Court to \nbalance “the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.”  In doing so, this court must consider:  (1) the scope of the particular \nintrusion; (2) the manner in which it is conducted; (3) the justification for initiating it; (4) \nand the place in which it is conducted.   \nIn general, the strip search procedure at the Jail following transfer can be gleaned \nfrom a review of the testimony of Plaintiff Robert Teague, who was strip searched \nfollowing a transfer from another detention facility.  Robert Teague testified that in 2003 \nhe was arrested in Christian County, Kentucky for possession of marijuana and drug \nparaphernalia.  (Teague depo., pp. 29-31).  He was lodged in the Christian County Jail \nwhere he was not subject to a strip search even though he had a pending drug charge.  \n(Teague depo., p. 31).   \nThe following day he was transported to court where he pled guilty to the charges.  \nUpon his return to Christian County Jail, he was again not strip searched.  He was then \nserved with an outstanding warrant from Hopkins County for theft by deception.  He was \n  11\n\nheld at the Christian County Jail until a transport officer arrived to take him to the \nHopkins County Jail.  (Teague depo., p. 32).  Upon arrival at the Hopkins County Jail and \nfollowing booking, Teague was taken into a small room (the property room) by a male \ndeputy jailer for purposes of changing into a jail uniform.  He was placed behind a \ncurtain and asked to remove his street clothes.  He was told to show the bottom of his \nfeet, bend over, spread his buttocks, cough, and then hold up his scrotum.  Thereafter, he \nwas given jail clothes to put on and was taken to a general population cell.  (Teague \ndepo., p 36).  The deputy jailer was the only one in the room during the strip search and \ndid not touch Teague at anytime.  (Teague depo., pp. 35-36).   \nThe scope and manner of the strip search following a transfer, as well as the place \nconducted (the first, third, and fourth factors of the Bell test), were clearly reasonable.  \nThe inmate was searched by a jailer of the same sex during a change out procedure, in a \nroom out of view of other persons, and the inmate was not touched by the deputy jailer in \nthe process.          \nThe second factor, i.e., “justification for initiating [the search]” outweighs any \ninvasion of the inmates’ personal rights.  Obviously, the justification for a strip search \nfollowing transfer from another detention facility is to prevent the introduction of \ncontraband into the facility that could expose the inmates and staff to harm.  An inmate \nwho has been incarcerated in another detention facility has possibly been exposed to \ncontraband, especially if that detention facility has lenient procedures upon intake, as \nwell as after contact visits, court appearances, medical appointments, and work programs.  \nJust a few years ago, the Crittenden County Jail was searched by law enforcement \nagencies, with guns, alcohol, and unauthorized visitors being found in and among the \n  12\n\ngeneral population areas.  (See Affidavit of James Lantrip, attached hereto as Exhibit “F” \nand newspaper articles, attached hereto as Exhibit “G”).  Crittenden County is only a few \nmiles from the Hopkins County Detention Center and is one of the facilities that \nfrequently transferred inmates to Hopkins County.  (See Affidavit of James Lantrip).   \nIt is unknown how many other detention facilities in Kentucky have similar lax \nprocedures.  A County should not have to rely on the security procedures of another \ndetention facility.  There is no way of knowing what those procedures are and if they are \nin fact utilized and/or enforced by the transferring detention facility.  The safety of the \nJail’s staff and inmates are at risk, which must be protected.   \nFor the same reasons, the Kentucky Corrections Cabinet does not rely on the \nsearching procedures of other detention facilities.  Their strip search procedure requires \nall inmates to be strip searched upon transfer from another detention facility --- “All \ninmates shall be subject to a strip search if . . . entering  . . . an institution.”2  (See \nKentucky Corrections Search Policy, attached hereto as Exhibit “H”).            \nObviously, an inmate in a detention facility has had ample opportunity to realize \nthat he is incarcerated, may continue to be incarcerated, and therefore has had ample time \nto hide contraband on his person.  Furthermore, if that inmate is incarcerated in a facility \nthat allows smoking, he has been around and/or had possession of cigarettes, which are \nconsidered contraband at the Hopkins County Jail.  (See Affidavit of James Lantrip, \nattached hereto as Exhibit “F”).  Hopkins County was the first detention center in \nKentucky to go smoke free.  In addition, many detention facilities today still allow \nsmoking.   \n                                                 \n2 The Corrections Cabinet does not receive inmates directly upon arrest but only after the inmate has been \nheld in a county detention center for several months or sometimes even years.    \n  13\n\n     The justification for the strip search can be found in the Kentucky Administrative \nRegulations directed to local jails, which specifically provide that an inmate may be strip \nsearched “after transport from or through an area to which the public may have access.”  \nPlaintiffs’ own expert testified that the Kentucky Administrative Regulation applicable to \nstrip searches is “very good” and that every jail should “adopt it as their policy.”  (Kamka \ndepo., pp. 24-25, attached hereto as Exhibit “I”).    \nIt is without question that inmates transported from one county to another are \nlikely transported “from or through an area to which the public may have access”, such as \njail lobbies, parking lots, unsecured transport vehicles, as well as restrooms, restaurants, \netc, if a bathroom or meal break is taken during the transport.  As the Supreme Court \nstated in Bell,  \nPrison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in \nthe adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment \nare needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain \ninstitutional security.  Such considerations are peculiarly within the \nprovince and professional expertise of corrections officials, and, in the \nabsence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials \nhave exaggerated their response to these considerations, courts should \nordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters. \n \nIt is clear that even if this Court were to only consider the Bell test, the Defendants’ \nformer practice of strip searching those inmates who were transferred from another \ndetention facility is reasonable and the justification clearly outweighs any invasion of \nrights that may occur as a result of the search.  As such, the transferred inmates’ Fourth \nAmendment rights were not violated by this practice and/or policy and the Defendants \nare clearly entitled to partial summary judgment as a matter of law on this issue.  \n  If however, this Court disagrees with Defendants’ arguments and determines that \nthe policy was violative of the inmates’ rights, this Court must nevertheless uphold it if it \n  14\n\nis “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”  Turner, 482 U.S. at 89.   \nThis rational relationship test requires this Court to consider the following factors: \n(1) whether there is a ‘valid, rational connection’ between the prison regulation and the \nlegitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it”;  (2) whether there are \nalternative means for inmates to exercise their constitutional rights; (3) the impact that \naccommodation of these constitutional rights may have on other guards and inmates, and \non the allocation of prison resources; and (4) the absence of ready alternatives is evidence \nof the reasonableness of a prison regulation.     \nFirst, Defendants have previously explained that their justification for strip \nsearches under this scenario is rationally connected to the policy.  Strip searches \nfollowing transfer from other detention facilities (where contraband may have been \nreadily available and where, during the transfer, inmates were exposed to areas where the \npublic may have access) will prohibit and/or deter contraband from being brought into \nthe Jail.  Furthermore, the alternative proposed by Plaintiffs is not reasonable.   \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants should be required to conduct some sort of \ninvestigation upon receiving each new transfer before determining whether a strip search \nshould be conducted.  In this “utopia”, the booking officer would need to interview the \ntransporting officer to determine if the inmate was transported through a jail lobby, \nparking lot, or other area exposed to the public before he was placed in his/her vehicle.  \nOf course, this practice would be as full-proof as the transporting officer’s memory.  As \nto the actual transport, the booking officer would also have to ask: (1) whether the \ntransporting officer thoroughly searched his vehicle after his last transport of an \ninmate/arrestee; (2) whether the inmate was allowed to sit in the front or back seat; (3) \n  15\n\nwhether the inmate was allowed to smoke cigarettes during the transport and/or had them \nin his possession when he took him into custody; (4) whether the inmate was handcuffed \nthe entire time during the transport; (5) whether any stops were made during the \ntransport; (6) where the inmate’s personal belongings were kept during the transport; (7) \nwhether his personal belongings (upon taking him into custody) contained any items of \ncontraband, e.g., cigarettes, prescription drugs, knives, etc.  Again, this process would \nhave to rely strictly on the transporting officer’s memory. \nIn addition, the booking officer would have to call the transferring facility and \ndetermine if, during his incarceration, the inmate (1) had any contact visits; (2) had any \ncourt appearances; (3) worked outside the facility; (4) had been taken for any medical \ntreatment outside of the facility; (5) had any violent or drug charges pending against him \nin that county; (6) had been given any furloughs; (7) had reported to the jail via a \ncontrolled intake procedure; (8) had been strip searched at anytime during his \nincarceration; (9) had been intermingled with any violent or drug offenders.3   \nThe person who answers the phone at the jail is not going to have this \ninformation.  This type of information would have to be gathered from various sources \nsuch as the medical staff, the Class D program director, administrative staff, etc.  This \nprocedure would be extremely cumbersome, not necessarily reliable, a long process that \ncould take hours or even days, and is therefore not a reasonable “ready alternative.”    \nFurthermore, recall that the Supreme Court stated that  \n \nThis is not a ‘least restrictive alternative’ test:  prison officials do not have \nto set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of \naccommodating the claimant’s constitutional complaint.  But if an inmate \n                                                 \n3 Recall Teague fits into several of these categories.  He was charged with possession of marijuana by \nChristian County, had been to court, was likely held with other drug offenders, and  had not been strip \nsearched at anytime during his incarceration at the Christian County Jail.   \n  16\n\ncan point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner’s rights at \nde minimis cost to valid penological interests, a court may consider that as \nevidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship \nstandard.         \n \nId. at 90-91.  This alternative is not reasonable and would not be at “de mimimis \ncost”.  This would require the Jail to hire more deputies, as more time is needed to book \nan inmate.  It would also require the Jail to hold the inmate in an area that has no access \nto other inmates, etc. until all of the information is gathered (hours or even days).  And it \nwould require the staff to be more sensitive to any safety concerns that may exist while \nthis investigation is conducted.   \nBoth Bell and Turner caution that “Prison administrators . . . should be accorded \nwide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in \ntheir judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain \ninstitutional security. . . .  [C]ourts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in \nsuch matters.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 547-48.  And “courts should be particularly conscious of \nthe ‘measure of judicial deference owed to corrections officials . . . in gauging the \nvalidity of the regulation.’”  Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90 (internal quotations omitted). \n  Furthermore, recall that two Eastern District of Kentucky courts have held that \ninmates who are taken to court and/or are on work detail can be strip searched upon their \nreturn to the facility.  See Richerson and Black, supra.  There is absolutely no legitimate \nreason to differentiate between inmates who are transported to court by a transporting \nofficer and/or on supervised work detail (and therefore likely to have accessed areas to \nwhich the public has access) and those inmates who are transported from one correctional \nfacility to another (and also likely have accessed areas to which the public has access).   \nIn fact, persons who have been transferred from another facility may be more of a \n  17\n\nsecurity risk than those who were merely transported to court or on work detail.  At least \nin the latter, the detention facility is aware of its own security practices, knows whether \nthe person has been previously strip searched, and exercises control over the deputy \njailers who supervise them in court and on work detail.  In the case of a transferred \ninmate, the detention facility knows absolutely nothing about the security practices of the \nother facility, nor whether the inmate has been previously strip searched (and even if so, \nhow thorough that procedure is), and has absolutely no control over the transporting \nofficer who supervised the inmate during the transport.      \nIn light of the deference that must be accorded to a detention facility’s rules and \nregulations, it is clear that this Court must rule that Defendants’ practice of strip-\nsearching inmates following a transfer from another detention facility is a reasonable \nresponse to a legitimate penological interest and/or concern.  Defendants therefore are \nentitled to partial summary judgment on this issue, as a matter of law.      \nD.  Those cases cited by Plaintiffs for the proposition that a strip search \nfollowing a transfer from another facility are not relevant and highly \ndistinguishable.   \n \nThe Plaintiffs have cited five cases which they claim support their argument that \ninmates cannot be strip searched “following a transfer from another facility.”  First, it \nshould be noted that four of the five cases are from the Second Circuit, which apparently \ntakes a very conservative view of a jail’s right to strip search as that circuit does not even \nrecognize the right to strip search inmates following medical treatment or a court \nappearance.  See Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56 (2nd Cir. 2001) (Plaintiff who was \narrested, failed to turn over a pocket knife to the police, placed in a holding room at the \npolice station, subsequently taken to the hospital where he was treated, and then \n  18\n\nthereafter taken to a court appearance was improperly strip searched upon his arrival at \nthe jail).  The other three Second Circuit cases cited by Plaintiffs are Lee v. Perez, 175 \nF.Supp.2d 673 (S.D. N.Y. 2001); N.G. and S.G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225 (2nd Cir. \n2004); and Dodge v. County of Orange, 282 F.Supp.2d 41 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).  All three of \nthese cases cite Shain v. Ellison to support their holdings.   \nInterestingly, in Shain, despite the dissent’s argument otherwise, the Second \nCircuit refused to apply the Turner four factor “reasonably related to legitimate \npenological objectives” standard.  273 F.3d 65-6, 70.  The majority believed that the \nTurner opinion only applied to prisons, not jails.  Had the majority applied the test, \nhowever, they would have ruled that strip searching an inmate after he refused to hand \nover a pocket knife, was treated at the local hospital, and had a court appearance was \nrationally related to a legitimate penological objective.   \nIn contrast, the Sixth Circuit has applied the Turner four factor “reasonably \nrelated to legitimate penological objectives” test to suits brought by pre-trial detainees \nchallenging jail regulations.  See e.g., Martucci v. Johnson, 944 F.2d 291 (6th Cir. 1991) \nand Ward v. Washtenaw Co. Sheriff’s Dept., 881 F.2d 325 (6th Cir. 1989).  In addition, \nseveral sister courts within this Circuit have applied that test to cases in which pre-trial \ndetainees challenged a jails’ strip search policies.  See e.g., Rose v. Saginaw County, 353 \nF.Supp.2d 900 (E.D. Mich., 2005); Johnson v. City of Kalmazoo, 124 F.Supp.2d 1099 \n(W.D. Mich., 2000).   \nAs a result, because the Second Circuit cases do not apply the same test as the \nSixth Circuit, they should not be considered by this Court.  Regardless, as will be \ndiscussed below, those cases cited by Plaintiffs, are highly distinguishable because four \n  19\n\nof the five of them did not involve a transfer from another correctional facility.     \nShain v. Ellison involved a man arrested by the Nassau County Sheriff’s \nDepartment, taken to the hospital and then a court appearance before he was initially \nincarcerated.  273 F.3d 56 (2nd Cir. 2001).  The Court held that the policy of strip \nsearching “each newly admitted inmate”, regardless of the criminal charges or whether \nthere is reasonable suspicion to believe that the inmate has contraband is unconstitutional.    \nThis holding is clearly distinguishable from the facts in this case as the inmate was not a \ntransfer from another correctional facility.  Furthermore, it clearly contradicts the holding \nof several courts in the Sixth Circuit.   \nLee v. Perez (a Second Circuit case) similarly involved a man who was arrested, \ntaken to the police department to be booked and then taken to court for arraignment \nbefore his initial incarceration.  175 F.Supp.2d 673 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  Accordingly, this \ncase is likewise distinguishable because the arrestee was not a transfer from another \ncorrectional facility, as Plaintiffs’ suggest. \nN.G. and S.G. v. Connecticut (Second Circuit) involved two runaway juveniles \nwho were not charged with any crimes.  382 F.3d 225 (2nd Cir. 2004).  They were strip \nsearched pursuant to Connecticut’s blanket strip search policy for all those admitted to \njuvenile detention centers.  The Second Circuit concluded that the searches conducted \nupon each initial entry into the custody of the State’s juvenile authorities were lawful, but \nthat “repetitive searches conducted while the girls remained in custody” upon transfer to \nother juvenile detention centers operated by the State of Connecticut was a violation of \nthe Fourth Amendment.   \nThis case is clearly distinguishable because there is no evidence that the inmates \n  20\n\nwho are received at Hopkins County have already been strip searched by anyone at the \nprevious detention facility and are therefore subjected to “repetitive searches.”  \nFurthermore, in N.G. and S.G., the State of Connecticut owned all of the juvenile \ndetention centers and therefore knew whether the juvenile had previously been strip \nsearched.  In addition, Connecticut transported the juveniles.  In this case, Hopkins \nCounty has no way of knowing whether an inmate was strip searched at the former \ndetention facility, and if they were, to what extent.  Nor does Hopkins County have \ncustody of the inmate during the transport.   \nThis case is further distinguished by the fact that the persons strip searched in \nN.G. and S.G. were juveniles who were not charged with any crimes.  One can certainly \nunderstand the Court’s reluctance to allow repetitive strip searches of juveniles who are \nnot charged with a crime.  In contrast, in this case, the inmates are adults who are charged \nwith crimes.  Clearly, for many reasons, this case is distinguishable.    \nDodge v. County of Orange (another Second Circuit case) involved inmates who \nchallenged the County’s strip search policy, which dictated that all newly arrested and/or \narraigned inmates be strip searched upon their initial arrival at the jail, without regard to \nthe nature of the charges against the inmate.  282 F.Supp.2d 41, 49 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).  \nThere is absolutely no indication in the opinion that the plaintiffs in that case were \nincarcerated in another detention facility prior to their incarceration in Orange County.  \nAs such, this case is likewise easily distinguishable.   \nFinally, the only alleged “transfer case” cited by the Plaintiffs that is not from the \nSecond Circuit is Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F.Supp.2d 131 (D. Mass. 2001).  However, \nthat case also did not involve an inmate who was transferred from another detention \n  21\n\nfacility.  In Ford, the plaintiffs were “female prisoners arrested or detained by members \nof the Boston Police Department [who] were processed in the usual manner and then \ntransported to the Suffolk County Jail for . . . detainment.”  Id. at 135.  Again, this case is \ndistinguishable, as it does not involve the opportunities for exposure to areas where \ncontraband can be found as in cases when a person is arrested, taken to a detention \nfacility outside of Hopkins County where they can remain for several hours, days, weeks, \nor months, wherein they can be “exposed to areas to which the public has access” and \nthen transported to Hopkins County by a transporting officer, where again they can be \n“exposed to areas to which the public has access.” \nPlaintiffs’ have not cited one single relevant case that supports their argument that \nthe Defendants’ former procedure of strip searching inmates following a transfer from \nanother detention facility is unconstitutional.  Defendants also have not found any cases \nin which a court has ruled that a practice of strip searching inmates following a transfer \nfrom another county detention facility is unconstitutional.  This case is one of first \nimpression.  Plaintiffs are asking this Court to be the first Court to determine that a \npractice utilized by numerous jails and prisons across the United States is \nunconstitutional, citing only Second Circuit distinguishable authority for their arguments.  \nHowever, undoubtedly, the Bell, Richerson, Black line of reasoning clearly dictates a \nfinding of constitutionality in this case.      \nE.  The Defendants’ strip search records which indicate a low occurrence \nof positive results following transport is merely a “testament to the \neffectiveness” of the search policy.     \n \n Plaintiffs attempt to argue that Defendants do not have reasonable suspicion to \nstrip search inmates who are transferred from another detention facility because the strip \n  22\n\nsearch reports for the last three years indicate positive results in only six instances.  \nHowever, in Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court was unimpressed with a similar \nargument made by the Plaintiffs.  They determined that the fact that only one inmate had \nbeen “discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the institution on his person may \nbe more a testament to the effectiveness of this search technique as a deterrent than to a \nlack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and import such items when the \nopportunity arises.”  441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979).   \nFurthermore, in Richerson, citing Bell, Judge Forester likewise categorically \nrejected a similar argument.  958 F.Supp. 299 (E.D. Ky. 1996).  In considering this \nargument, the Court stated as follows: \nIt is clear that a detention center has a legitimate interest in preventing the \nflow of contraband into the facility.  As previously pointed out, the \nSupreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish noted that the smuggling of contraband \nis ‘all too common an occurrence.’  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S at 559.  While \nthe plaintiff argues that the actual number of times contraband is found in \nthe detention center is relatively insignificant, the Court is unprepared to \ndiscount the seriousness of any occurrence of contraband in a detention \ncenter.  The Court is also mindful of the Supreme Court’s suggestion that \nthe lack of contraband ‘may be more testament to the effectiveness’ of a \nsearch policy ‘as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the \ninmates’ to smuggle contraband when given the opportunity.  Id.  Thus, \nthe Court is unimpressed by an argument based on the perceived lack of \ndocumented incidents involving contraband found within the detention \ncenter. \n \nId. at 306.   \nInmates being transferred to Hopkins County are likely aware that they may \nbe subjected to a strip search upon their arrival at the Hopkins County Jail.  As such, this \nCourt must conclude, as the Supreme Court did, that the low occurrence of positive \nresults is merely a “testament to the effectiveness” of the strip search policy “as a \ndeterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmates” to smuggle contraband \n  23\n\ninto the Jail.                       \n         Furthermore, it only takes one person to smuggle dangerous contraband into the \nJail to cause serious problems, such as injuries, escapes, and/or death.  A lax procedure in \nthis regard could result in the Jail’s liability for damages as a result of only one incident \nwhen contraband was not found.  Plaintiffs appear to attempt to minimize the results of \nthe strip search procedures because in five of the six cases, “the only contraband found \nwas cigarettes or tobacco-related items.”  (Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, p. 23, \nemphasis added).  However, as former Jailer James Lantrip stated in his affidavit, \ncigarettes are contraband in the Hopkins County Jail.  Persons who are able to smuggle \ncigarettes into the facility are commonly faced with threats of violence from other \ninmates who are desperate for a cigarette.  In addition, cigarettes are used as a form of \nbarter for trading prescription medications, food, and for gambling.  (See Lantrip \nAffidavit, attached hereto as Exhibit “F”).  Therefore, in this type of setting, cigarettes \ncan be as lethal and/or dangerous as a weapon, drugs, etc.  Until Plaintiffs and/or their \ncounsel have been in a position to supervise inmates, many of whom are dangerous, it is \ninappropriate to pass judgment on what type of contraband should cause concern.       \nF.  Even if this Court determines that the Jail’s former procedure is \nunconstitutional, Plaintiffs and/or the class members are not entitled \nto partial summary judgment because this Court must undertake an \nindependent analysis to determine if each of them would have been \notherwise subject to a lawful strip search.   \n \nEven if this Court determines that the Jail’s former procedure of strip searching \ninmates upon arrival following a transfer from another detention facility is \nunconstitutional, Plaintiffs and/or class members are not automatically entitled to a \nfinding that they were “subjected to an illegal search”, as Plaintiffs request.  Teague’s \n  24\n\ndeposition testimony is illustrative.  Just the day before he was transferred to Hopkins \nCounty, he had been charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.  He \nhad not been strip searched upon entry into the Christian County Jail.  He went to court, \nwhere he pled guilty to the charges and again was not strip searched following his court \nappearance.  The fact that Teague, on the day of transfer, had been convicted of \npossession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, in and of itself would make him eligible \nfor a lawful strip search.  See 501 KAR 3:120(3)(b).   \nLikewise, Ladonia Nelson, who was strip searched following a transfer from the \nCaldwell County Jail testified that she was previously convicted of possession of \nmethamphetamine.  Clearly, she would have been subjected to a lawful strip search. 501 \nKAR 3:120(3)(b).  Regardless, without considering each inmate file, criminal record, \netc., it is impossible to determine if each Plaintiff/class member was subjected to a lawful \nstrip search.  As such, even if this Court determines that the strip search policy at issue is \nunconstitutional, Plaintiffs’ Motion to the extent that it requests a ruling that those \nPlaintiffs/class members who were subjected to a strip search following a transfer are \nentitled to a ruling that their search was illegal in violation of their constitutional rights \nmust be denied pending a review of each inmate’s criminal record, jail records, etc.   \nG.  Plaintiffs are not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief. \nPlaintiffs request this Court to issue a preliminary injunction, ordering the \nDefendants to discontinue enforcement of their procedure of strip searching all arrestees \ntransferred from other detention facilities.  They cite the correct test which is that the \nCourt must consider (1) the plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the \nplaintiff may suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction; (3) whether granting the \n  25\n\ninjunction will cause substantial harm to others; and (4) the impact of an injunction upon \nthe public interest.  Déjà vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro Gov’t of Nashville, 274 F.3d 377, \n400 (6th Cir. 2001).   \nHowever, Plaintiffs cannot meet this test and are therefore not entitled to a \npreliminary injunction.  First, as Defendants have made clear in this Response and \nMotion, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits.   \nSecond, the Plaintiffs will not suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not \nissued.  Defendants have repealed the previous procedure and replaced it with a \nprocedure that only allows a strip search of a transferring inmate if his criminal charges \nor some other factor invokes reasonable suspicion.  (See Exhibit “A”).  In Brandywine, \nInc. v. City of Richmond, Ky, an adult bookstore challenged a city’s zoning ordinance \nseeking injunctive and monetary relief.  359 F.3d 830 (6th Cir. 2004).  During the \npendency of the action, the city amended the offending ordinance such that it no longer \nprohibited Brandywine, Inc. from operating in the zone where it was located.  The Sixth \nCircuit held that the mootness doctrine precluded the Court from issuing an injunction \nwhen the ordinance was no longer in effect.   Id. at 836.  “We can neither declare \nunconstitutional nor enjoin the enforcement of a provision that is no longer in effect.”  Id.  \nAs a result, Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief must be denied as the \nPlaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits, and regardless of that, they will not \nsuffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not issued since the procedure is no longer in \neffect.   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants hereby respectfully request that Plaintiffs’ \n  26\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment and for Preliminary Injunction be denied and that \nDefendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment be granted.  This Court is barred from \ndetermining that a former procedure is unconstitutional.  However, Defendants request \nthat this Court determine that the past procedure of strip searching those inmates \nfollowing a transfer from another detention facility was in fact constitutional and \ntherefore dismiss all such claims by the Plaintiffs/class members.  \n        Respectfully submitted, \nDENTON & KEULER \nP.O.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY\nAT OWENSBORO\nEDWARD LEE SUTTON, et al., ) ELECTRONICALLYFILED\n)\nPlaintiffs )\n)\nVS. ) CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:03CV-3-M\n)\nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY, et al., )\n)\nDefendants. )\nPLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DECERTIFY CLASS\nIntroduction\nEvery reason exists for this case to move forward as a class action. Two federal district\ncourts in Kentucky, when confronted with virtually identical facts, certified strip-search class actions\nfor precisely the reasons that apply here. When certification was challenged in one of those cases,\ncertification was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit, relying on law that refutes all of the arguments\nadvanced by Defendants for decertifying a class action that was originally certified with their\nagreement.\nThe Court should not be misled -- Defendants argue nothing in support of their motion that\nthey did not know when they originally agreed to certification. Defendants had good reasons for\nagreeing to certification, reasons they abandon now in an inexplicable attempt to obtain some\nundefined procedural advantage. Clearly, they offer the Court no more superior means for fairly and\nefficiently adjudicating this controversy than the class action mechanism presently in place.\nDefendants simply wish to discard that mechanism and the obvious procedural advantages it offers\nthe Court in favor of the institution of hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of individual actions.\n\nDefendants concede in their motion that decertification is likely to result in at least 730\nindividual actions: \"It is without a doubt that the Court will be required to conduct an individual\ndetermination of liability, as well as damages, if any, as to each potential class member (at this time\n730 or so) ....\" Defendants’ Motion, p. 7. Defendants’ estimate of the number of potential class\nmembers is based upon just the number of questionnaires that have been completed and returned to\nPlaintiffs’ counsel after an unsolicited mailing. It does not take into account: (a) that Plaintiffs\nmailed almost 7000 questionnaires; (b) that more than 2200 were returned undelivered; and (c) that\nPlaintiffs are still receiving completed questionnaires from potential claimants.\nThat Plaintiffs have not yet received responses from approximately 4000 potential claimants\nto whom questionnaires were presumably delivered should not be taken as any indication that such\nclaimants were not strip-searched in violation of their constitutional rights, or that many will not\nassert an individual claim if required and given the opportunity to do so. First, the response rate of\nmore than 15% of delivered questionnaires is relatively high for an unsolicited mailing from a\nlawyer with whom laypersons have had no previous contact. Second, a variety of factors could\nexplain why questionnaires have not been returned by class members, including but not limited to:\n(1) questionnaires lost in the mail either prior to delivery or in the course of their return; (2) delivery\nof questionnaires to the wrong address; (3) questionnaires discarded after delivery as \"junk mail\"; (4)\nquestionnaires opened and discarded by persons other than the intended recipient; (5) suspicion of\nthe addressee upon receipt of correspondence from a lawyer with whom they have not had previous\ncontact; (6) illiteracy or some other disability that prevented the addressee from understanding and\nresponding to the questionnaire; and (7) embarrassment. After all, the Seventh Circuit has\ncharacterized the strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs were subjected as\n\"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive,\n2\n\nsignifying degradation and submission.\" MaryBeth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th\nCir. 1983).\nWhy abandon a class action in favor of hundreds, perhaps thousands of trials on liability and\ndamages? Defendants expect the Court to believe that jail officers will remember whether an\nindividual claimant was strip-searched, and if so, why -- i.e., that they will have a specific,\nindependent recollection, unsupported by any documentation, &not strip-searching one individual\namong many they may have seen on one day many years before, or of the details that warranted a\nparticular claimant’s strip-search.1 Such evidence, if it exists, and even if admissible under the\ncircumstances, would have dubious credibility, and would certainly not have the weight to overcome\nthe mountain of evidence -- the testimony from not only hundreds of victims of the Jail’s\nunconstitutional strip-search practices but from at least one former Jail employee2 -- that the Jail\ncustomarily strip-searched persons on admission to and just prior to their release from the Jail\nwithout regard to whether there existed the reasonable, individualized suspicion required by the\nclearly-established law. SeeMasters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977\n(1989).\nBackground\nPlaintiffs petitioned for class certification on January 18, 2005. In their 21-page supporting\nmemorandum, Plaintiffs argued that this case satisfied all the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 (a)\nand (b) for certification as a class action. Plaintiffs attached to their petition 87 statements from\nindividuals who claimed to have been subjected to an unconstitutional strip-search upon entry to the\n1 The subclasses certified in this case with the agreement of Defendants rtm from January 9, 2002 (one year\npreceding the date on which Plaintiffs filed their original class action complaint). See Agreed Order of March 16,\n2005, ¶4. Because trial has been scheduled in this case to begin January 8, 2007, testifying officers may be asked to\nrecall events happening as many as five years prior.\n2 Donald Gossett, who worked at the Jail from December 2000 to January 2002, testified that it was the Jail’s\npolicy to strip-search everyone entering the Jail’s general population, returning from Court, and just prior to release.\nSee Exhibit A, Gossett depo., pp. 14, 18-19, 22-25.\n\nJail. Of those 87 individuals, 32 also claimed to have been subjected to a strip-search upon release\nfrom the Jail. Plaintiffs also attached to their petition an additional eight statements of individuals\nwho claimed only to have been subjected to an unconstitutional strip search upon release from the\nJail.\nDespite having already deposed the original Plaintiffs to this action, Lester Turner and\nEdward Sutton, and having been provided the statements attached as exhibits to the memorandum in\nsupport of Plaintiffs’ petition, Defendants in their three-page response did not dispute any of the\nfollowing:\n(1) That there are questions of law or fact common to all\nmembers of each class;\n(2) That the claims of the representative parties are typical of the\nclaims of the class;\n(3) That the representative parties will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class;\n(4) That the prosecution of separate actions by or against the\nindividual members of the class would create a risk of either\n(a) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to\nindividual members of the class which would establish\nincompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the\nclass, or (b) adjudications with respect to individual members\nof the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive\nof the interests of the other members not parties to the\nadjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to\nprotect their interests;\n(5) That the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act\non grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\nappropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; and\n(6) That the questions of law and fact common to the members of\nthe class predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members, and that a class action is superior to\nother available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication\nof the controversy.\n4\n\nThe only argument Defendants offered in opposition to Plaintiffs’ petition for certification\nwas that the numerosity requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) was not satisfied. For obvious\nreasons, numerosity is not raised now as an argument by Defendants in support of their motion to\ndecertify.\nDespite Defendants’ initial opposition to Plaintiffs’ petition, they subsequently agreed to the\ncertification of two sub-classes: 1) \"All persons arrested for minor offenses who were required by\nDefendants in the Hopkins County Jail, after becoming entitled to release, to remove their clothing\nfor visual inspection\"; and 2) \"All persons arrested for non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanor\noffenses who were required by the Defendants to remove their clothing for a visual inspection on\nadmission to the Jail\". See Agreed Order of March 16, 2005, ¶¶ 2(a) and 3. Each sub-class includes\nall individuals who were subjected to such searches since January 9, 2002. Id, ¶ 4.\nWhy did Defendants first oppose Plaintiffs’ petition, only to subsequently agree to class\ncertification? On January 31, 2005, after filing their petition for class certification and prior to\nDefendants’ response, Plaintiffs sent to Defendants a letter encouraging them to agree to class\ncertification. In that letter, Plaintiffs explained that if Defendants persuaded the Court to deny\nPlaintiffs’ petition, it would produce a worse result for Defendants than certification because it would\ntrigger a \"flood of separate lawsuits\" that would be far more expensive to try than to settle, and that\nmight well make settlement impossible. See Exhibit B. Defendants apparently agreed.\nArgument\nI. Defendants’ Have Failed to Show Any New Facts or Law That Warrant\nDecertification.\nA court cannot decertify a class action without a sound basis. GeneralElec. Telephone Co. of\nthe Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158 (1982); In re Exterior Siding and Aluminum Coil\n\nAntitrustLitig., 696 F.2d 613,616 (8th Cir. 1982); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c). \"Although a Rule 23 ruling\nmight be conditional, a judge will not alter a previous ruling unless changes in the facts call for it.\"\nIn re Exterior Siding, supra at 616.\nMoreover, the grounds offered for decertification must not \"be ones that ... could have been\nargued earlier but were not.\" In re Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., Securities Litig., 838 F. Supp.\n109, 114 (E.D.N.Y. 1993). The party proposing decertification \"should, at a minimum, show some\nnewly developed facts or law in support of their desired action.\" Kramer v. Scientific ControlCorp.,\n67 F.R.D. 98, 99 (E.D.Pa. 1975) (denying defendants’ motion for reconsideration of certification\nbecause the grounds they gave could have been asserted earlier, but were not).\nDefendants argue that this class action must be decertified because the Court must conduct\n\"730 individual trials to determine (1) whether the person was actually strip-searched; and if so (2)\nwhether there was reasonable suspicion for doing so.\" Defendants’ Memorandum, p. 20. This\nargument is based upon what has always been Defendants’ central defense in these proceedings --\nthat the searches, if they occurred at all, were justified by a reasonable suspicion. See Defendants’\noriginal Answer (filed more than three years ago), ¶ 11. Absolutely nothing has occurred in this\ncase to make this argument any more relevant now than it was prior to Plaintiffs’ petition for class\ncertification.\nII. Plaintiffs Would Be Unfairly and Manifestly Prejudiced By Decertification.\nOn motion to decertify, a district court must also consider \"whether the parties or the class\nwould be unfairly prejudiced by a change in proceedings at this point.\" Manual for Complex\nLitigation, Third, § 30.18 at 238; see also In re Harcourt Bracer Jovanovich, Inc. Securities Litig.,\n838 F.Supp. 109, 114 (E.D.N.Y.1993) (denying plaintiffs’ motion to amend class action order\nbecause defendants’ defenses against the class would be prejudiced by the withdrawal of some of the\n6\n\nnamed class representatives). Plaintiffs already have incurred substantial expense in reviewing all of\nDefendants’ inmate files for the purpose of acquiring contact information for direct mailing of notice\nof class certification to potential class members. Plaintiffs also have borne the expense of published\nnotice. Having been notified of certification of this class action, many potential class members\nundoubtedly have justifiably relied upon the class procedure to adjudicate their rights, and have not\nyet come forward to advance individual claims. The subclasses are simply too large for\ndecertification not to result in the exclusion of a significant number of meritorious claims.\nAlso, in reliance upon Defendants’ agreement to class certification, Plaintiffs disclosed to\nDefendants work product and attorney/client-privileged information to advance settlement. After\nthis class action was certified with the agreement &Defendants, the Honorable Magistrate Judge E.\nRobert Goebel -- again with the agreement of the parties -- entered an Order setting a settlement\nconference for July 14, 2005. At the settlement conference, the parties were unable to reach a\nsettlement because Defendants had questions about the likely volume of claims. In an effort to\nestimate class volume to advance settlement, Plaintiffs included with notice of class certification\nquestionnaires inquiring whether the persons to whom direct notice was mailed had been strip-\nsearched at the Jail. Had there been any issue about the propriety of certification at the time,\nPlaintiffs would have been entitled to withhold questionnaire responses from Defendants as work\nproduct and as attorney/client-privileged communications. However, Judge Goebel ordered\nPlaintiffs to provide to Defendants copies of all questionnaires that were returned to class counsel,\nand Plaintiffs, in reliance on Defendants’ good faith and representations, and to address Defendants’\nquestions about the size of the putative class, readily agreed. Decertification now would grant\nDefendants an advantage they would not have had before, and would obviously unfairly prejudice\nPlaintiffs.\n7\n\nFinally, Defendants have waited until just eight months before trial to ask this Court to\ndecertify this class action and to start litigating from scratch more than 700 claims. Plaintiffs have\nalready waited more than three years for resolution of their claims. Nowhere in Defendants’\nMemorandum is it explained how breaking this litigation into more than 700 pieces will lead to a\nquicker, more efficient resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims.\nIII. Federal Authority -- Particularly the Sixth Circuit’s Opinion in Eddleman -- Is\nDispositive of All of Defendants’ Arguments.\nPlaintiffs incorporate the entirety of the arguments in their Memorandum in Support of\nPetition for Class Certification as if fully set forth herein, and will not repeat them here. Instead,\nPlaintiffs will focus on refuting the specific contentions of Defendants’ Motion.\nA. Eddleman is Directly Applicable to This Case.\nThe Sixth Circuit’s decision in Eddleman v. Jefferson County, 1996 U. S.App. LEXIS 25298\n(August 29, 1996), cited by Defendants in their motion, is an unpublished decision. However,\nhaving cited and attempted to distinguish Eddleman in their motion, Defendants have made it fair\ngame.\nEddleman is the only case in which the Sixth Circuit has addressed certification of a strip-\nsearch class action, and it affirmed the decision of the district court judge, the Honorable Edward H.\nJohnstone, to certify a class action in that case. It has unquestionable precedential value in relation\nto the issue now before the Court. Given the Sixth Circuit’s controlling authority over this Court,\nthere is no published opinion -- save one from the Supreme Court, which has not issued an opinion\non a strip-search class action -- that is as important or directly relevant to the Court’s resolution of\nthe issues presented by Defendants’ Motion)\n3 In conformity with the requirements of 6 Cir. R. 28(g), Plaintiffs attach hereto as Exhibit C a full copy of the\nSixth Circuit’s decision in Eddleman.\n\nDefendants have attempted to distinguish Eddleman from this case on two grounds.\nDefendants argue first that there was a written policy in Eddleman, not present in this case, that\nmandated the unconstitutional searches in issue there. But the fact that the plaintiffs in Eddleman\nwere strip-searched pursuant to a written policy, as opposed to an unwritten custom or practice, had\nno bearing on the Sixth Circuit’s opinion. In addition, the Jail’s strip-search policy required that \"[a]\nstrip search ... be given anytime an inmate has ... been outside the jail and is returning to the jail.\"\nSee Exhibit D. Plaintiffs contend that this provision of the Jail’s strip-search policy mandated the\nstrip-searches of persons like Messrs. Sutton and Turner, who were taken to court, ordered released\nby a judge, but then strip-searched prior to their release after they were returned to the Jail.\nSecond, Defendants argue that Eddleman was decided prior to the enactment of the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. 1997e (\"the PLRA\"). But this Court has already held that the\nPLRA is inapplicable to this case (see Memorandum Opinion and Order of December 19, 2005, pp.\nPlaintiffs, Under Eddleman, Have Satisfied the Rule 23(a) Requirements of\nCommonality and Adequacy of Representation.\nDefendants claim that their strip-search determinations were all based upon a \"decision tree\"\nthat took into account \"any number of reasons\" -- including a claimant’s criminal background,4 jail\nfile and any other conduct \"that would invoke reasonable suspicion\" -- in determining whether a\nstrip-search of an individual was warranted. Defendants’ Memorandum, p. 16. As a consequence,\nDefendants argue, Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the Rule 23 (a) requirements of commonality or adequacy\nof representation because the Court must conduct \"mini-trials\" of each Plaintiff’s claim to determine\nwhether they were strip-searched and, if so, why.\n4 Defendant Lantrip has already testified that the Jail did not take into account an arrestee’s criminal background\nin deciding whether to strip-search. See Exhibit E, 1/17/06 Lantrip depo., pp. 14-16.\n9\n\nBut the law is clear that in deciding whether to certify or decertify a class action, it is the\nallegations of Plaintiffs that must be accepted as true, and that any doubts as to certification must be\nresolved in Plaintiffs’ favor. Cross v. National Trust Life Ins. Co., 553 F.2d 1026, 1029 (6th Cir.\n1977). Plaintiffs have alleged -- and, as set forth below, the evidence adduced in discovery thus far\nsupports -- that Defendants had a policy, custom and practice of strip-searching persons on\nadmission to and/or just prior to release from the Jail without regard to whether there existed the\nrequisite, individualized reasonable suspicion required by law. Plaintiffs Third Amended Complaint,\n¶¶2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 25 and 27.\nThe defendants in Eddleman made a similar argument as Defendants here, and it was soundly\nrejected by the Sixth Circuit:\nDefendants contend that the representative Plaintiffs’ claims have \"substantive\nfactual differences\" and do not meet the commonality requirement of Rule\n23(a) ....\nThis ... does not defeat the commonality requirement because Plaintiffs’ legal\ntheory is that all members of the class were subject to unconstitutional searches\nafter being arrested for minor offenses pursuant to a blanket policy or custom ....\nCommon legal theories therefore bind the class even if some sets of facts are\nmore severe than others. This is true even where the putative plaintiff is subject\nto a full strip search instead of a partial one, or the fact that some individuals\nmay fail to meet the qualifications for the class because it can be shown that\nthere was reasonable suspicion to strip search them .... These isolated\ninstances of non-commonality are not grounds for denying class certification.\nEddleman, Exhibit B at \"11-13 (emphasis added). For the same reason, the Sixth Circuit in\nEddleman denied the defendants’ argument that factual differences among the claims rendered the\nnamed class plaintiffs inadequate representatives of the unnamed class. Id, * 14.\nC. Plaintiffs, Under Eddleman, Have Satisfied the Rule 23(b)(3)Requirements of\nPredominance and Superiority.\nFor the same reasons referenced above, Defendants claim that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy Rule\n23(b)(3)’s requirement that common questions of law or fact predominate over any questions\n10\n\naffecting individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the\nfair and just adjudication of the controversy. Again, the same argument was advanced by defendants\nin Eddleman and rejected by the Sixth Circuit:\nDefendants argue that because the reasonableness of any search must be\nexamined on a case-by-case basis, the constitutionality of strip searches cannot\nbe properly evaluated in a class action. The basis for the complaint, however,\narises precisely because the Defendants did not conduct an individualized\nassessment of the need for each search. Plaintiffs allege, and that allegation\nmust be taken as true for our purposes here, that their constitutional rights were\nviolated by a policy or custom, written or unwritten, to search every arrestee\nwho entered the jail, regardless of the individual circumstances. Due to the\nsingle legal theory and the similar facts for each Plaintiff, a class action would\nbe superior to individual actions.\nId., \"16-17 (emphasis added).\nThe Sixth Circuit also held that decertification on account of varying damages among the\nclass members is also not appropriate. \"Varying damage levels rarely prohibit a class action if the\nclass members’ claims possess factual and legal commonality.\" Id., * 18. See also Mayer v. Mylod,\n988 F.2d 635,640 (6th Cir. 1993) (granting class certification on common question of liability, even\nthough damages were disparate); De LaFuente v. Stokely Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 233 (7th\nCir. 1983) (Rule 23(b)(3) class actions commonly involve differing levels of injury and damages\nacross the class; however, that does make Rule 23(b)(3) certification inappropriate).\nIt was for these reasons that the Sixth Circuit affirmed class certification in Eddleman, and it\nis for these same reasons that Defendants’ motion to decertify should be denied.~\n5 Subsequent to the Sixth Circuit’s ruling in Eddleman, another federal court in Kentucky certified yet another\nstrip-search class action. Wilson v. Franklin County, Civil Action No. 97-35 (E.D.Ky. 1997) (Hon. Joseph M. Hood\npresiding). See Exhibit F.\n11\n\nD. The Authorities Cited by Defendants Are Distinguishable and Are Buried\nUnder the Overwhelming Weight of Federal Precedent Favoring Certification\nof Strip-Search Class Actions.\nThe authorities cited by Defendants that do not concern strip searches are all readily\ndistinguishable from the case at hand. For instance, In Re American Medical Systems, Inc., 75 F.3 d\n1069 (6th Cir. 1996) was a product liability case concerning the sale of penile implants that spanned\n22 years. The Sixth Circuit found class certification improper because 1) the penile implant products\nwere different; 2) each plaintiff had a unique complaint; and 3) each plaintiff received different\ninformation or assurances from his treating physician. Id., at 1085. American Medical is simply\ninapplicable to this case, as are the other authorities cited by Defendants involving fraud, Title VII\nviolations, and work/life restrictions imposed on prostitutes in Winnemucca, Nevada.\nDefendants cite to only two strip-search cases in which a federal court denied class\ncertification --Bledsoe v. Combs, 2000 WL 681094 (S.D.Ind. 2000) and Noon v. Sailor, 2000 WL\n684274 (S.D.Ind. 2000). Both opinions were written by the same judge in another jurisdiction and in\na different circuit, were issued the same day, and were unpublished. Both opinions are identical but\nfor the names of the parties and the estimated number of potential claimants. It is thus reasonable to\nquestion whether the court subjected the class certification issues in those cases to the \"rigorous\nanalysis\" required by law. In any event, the court found that joinder of the 17 plaintiffs in Bledsoe\nand the 103 plaintiffs in Noon \"provides a practical alternative to the proposed class action.\" Id., at\n3. That is hardly the case here with more than 730 claims and counting.\nIn any event, this unpublished authority is literally buried under the weight of federal\nprecedent favoring the certification of strip-search class actions.

In fact, the courts in both Bfihovde and\nManeely cited but declined to follow Bledsoe and Noon.6\nIV. Defendants Cannot Credibly Refute Plaintiffs’ Claims That the Jail Had a Practice of\nStrip-Searching Persons On Admission To or Just Prior To Their Release From the\nJail Without Reasonable Suspicion.\nPlaintiffs have never argued that the documentation in a claimant’s inmate file should not be\ntaken into account in assessing the legitimacy of claims, and Defendants’ discussion on pages 18 and\n19 of their memorandum shows just how easily the wheat can be separated from the chaff-- indeed,\nthis is the very process in which the parties engaged in resolving the Jefferson County and Franklin\nCounty strip-search class actions.\nBut \"no documentation was maintained by Defendants as to who was strip-searched\" at the\nJail. See Defendants’ Objections to Magistrate Judge’s Memorandum Opinion and Order, p. 2. This\n6 With the exception of Eddleman, this list does not include strip-search class actions, like Wilson v. Franklin\nCounty, supra n. 5, that were certified and resolved with no reported decision.\n13\n\nis a serious violation of Kentucky law as well as the Jail’s own internal policies. It entitles Plaintiffs\nto an adverse inference instruction that every Plaintiff who was strip searched was strip searched\nwithout any reasonable suspicion, and may even bar Defendants from presenting any evidence to the\ncontrary.\nKentucky law mandates that \"[t]he jailer shall require that a strip search or body cavity\nsearch shall be documented. Documentation shall include: 1) basis for reasonable suspicion to\nconduct a search; 2) date and time of search; 3) name of prisoner; 4) name of person conducting\nsearch; 5) type of search; and 6) result of search.\" 501 KAR 3:120 (emphasis added). Further, the\nHopkins County Jail policy, instituted specifically in respect to the Kentucky regulations, states that\n\"When an inmate is ordered to be strip searched, the Deputy Jailer will note the reason for this\ndecision on the inmate incident report and make a log entry listing the inmate’s name and explaining\nthe purpose of the search. Explain the probable cause that existed to warrant the strip search.\" See\nExhibit D. Neither the Kentucky regulation nor the Jails’ strip-search policy provide for any\nexceptions. Whenever a strip-search is conducted, the law and policy both require documentation.\n\"[W]here one party wrongfully denies another the evidence necessary to establish a fact in\ndispute, the court should draw the strongest allowable inference in favor of the aggrieved party.\"\nWelsh v. U.S., 844 F. 2d 1239, 1247 (6th Cir. 1988), quoting NationalAss’n of Radiation Survivors v.\nTurnage, 115 F.R.D. 543 (N.D.Cal. 1987); Latimore v. CitibankFed. Sav. Bank, 151 F.3d 712, 717\n(7th Cir. 1998) (\"The violation of a record-retention regulation creates a presumption that the missing\nrecord contained evidence adverse to the violator.\"); Favors v. Fisher, 13 F.3d 1235, 1239 (8t~ Cir.\n1994) (because employer violated record retention regulation, plaintiff\"was entitled to the benefit of\na presumption that the destroyed documents would have bolstered her case\"). Thus, Plaintiffs at a\nminimum will be entitled to an adverse inference instruction stating that because Defendants did not\n14\n\nmaintain the appropriate records, the jury must infer that, had they kept those records, the records\nwould have shown that Defendants did not have reasonable suspicion to strip search Plaintiffs and\nthat Defendants had a custom and practice of strip searching inmates at the Jail regardless of whether\nthere was the requisite individualized, reasonable suspicion.\nMoreover, due to Defendants’ willful failure to abide by the requirements of Kentucky law as\nwell as their own internal policies, the adverse inference in this case should be considered\nirrebuttable -- conclusively establishing the lack of reasonable suspicion on the part of Defendants in\nconducting the strip searches at issue. It is within the inherent power of this Court to determine not\nonly that an adverse inference is warranted under the circumstances, but also that the inference is an\nirrebuttable one that denies Defendants the opportunity to present testimonial or other evidence to\ncontradict it. See, e.g., Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 44-45 (1991) (recognizing inherent\npower of courts to fashion remedies for conduct that disrupts the judicial process); U.S.v. Shaffer\nEquip. Co., 11 F.3d 450, 463 (4th Cir. 1993) (court has inherent power to sanction parties). Ample\nauthority exists for the exclusion of testimonial evidence on an issue that should have been preserved\nin another form, as is the case here. See, e.g., UniguardSec. Ins. v. LakewoodEng’g &Mfg., 982\nF.2d 363, 369 (9th Cir. 1992) (upholding exclusion of testimony in response to defendant’s failure to\nmaintain physical evidence); Harmann v. Ridge Tool Co., 539 N.W.2d 753,756-57 (Mich. App.\n1995) (excluding evidence and explaining \"it would be unfair to permit the negligent party to benefit\nfrom his own error... Whether the evidence was destroyed or lost accidentally or in bad faith is\nirrelevant, because the opposing party suffered the same prejudice\").\nBased on Defendants’ blatant disregard for the law requiring documentation of all strip\nsearches and the resulting prejudice to Plaintiffs, an irrebuttable adverse inference is warranted. This\nCourt has the inherent authority to impose such a sanction, and the end result of that sanction means\n15\n\nthat Defendants are barred from attempting to offer any evidence that the strip searches at issue were\nbased on reasonable suspicion.\nEven if the Court chooses not to impose such a sanction, whether a claimant was strip-\nsearched and why will be based entirely upon the recollection of Jail officers. Defendants are\nsuggesting that Jail officers can independently recollect whether they strip-searched one particular\nindividual among many -- and if so, why -- on a day two, three, four or even five years ago. Such a\nsuggestion beggars credulity. In any event, Plaintiffs have already asked Defendants to identify\npersons having such recollections with regard to the over 730 claimants identified thus far (see\nExhibit G), and Plaintiffs eagerly await their response.\nV. Can Defendants Even Afford the Litigation of Hundreds, Much Less Thousands, of\nIndividual Actions?\nIt is doubtfial Defendants have the economic wherewithal to bear the burden of hundreds or\nthousands of individual actions. In fact, it is for this reason primarily that Plaintiffs oppose\nDefendants’ motion. While the certification of this class action was and remains fully supported by\nlaw as well as logic, individual actions might ultimately deliver the largest recovery for Plaintiffs --\nwere Defendants able to pay it. Plaintiffs thus find themselves in the unusual position of resisting\nDefendants’ flirtation with economic suicide in order to preserve what is perhaps the only source\nfrom which they can recover their damages.\nAssume that the Court ultimately tries only 700 cases, and that each case costs Defendants an\naverage of only $10,000 to prepare and try -- both very conservative assumptions. Even then,\nDefendants’ legal fees and expenses alone would amount to $7 million, and this does not take into\naccount actual and punitive damages assessed against them at trial, or the attorneys’ fees they will\nowe prevailing plaintiffs under 42 U. S.C. § 1988.\n16\n\nDefendants’ insurer has initiated a declaratory judgment action in an effort to establish that it\nhas no coverage obligation to Defendants for the claims in this litigation. Kentucky Ass’n of\nCounties All Lines Fund Trust v. Hopkins County, et aL, Action No. 05-CI-851, Commonwealth of\nKentucky, Franklin Circuit Court, Div. II.\nConclusion\nDefendants’ Motion does not make any sense procedurally or economically. Nowhere in\nDefendants’ Motion do they offer this Court any explanation of how breaking this single class action\ninto at least 700 pieces will make the Court’s job any easier, or will resolve this litigation any faster.\nDefendants’ arguments are rejected by the controlling authority in Eddleman and the enormous\nweight of other federal authorities favoring certification of strip-search class actions. Defendants\nhad good, practical reasons for agreeing to certification the first time around, and those reasons -- not\nto mention the law -- require that their motion be denied.\nRespectfully Submitted,\ns/ Bart L.

TURNER, \nLINDA JOYCE FORD, TIMOTHY D. MAY, \nLADONIA W. WILSON, ROBIN LITTLEPAGE, \nROBERT R. TEAGUE, and TABITHA NANCE \nINDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS \nSIMILARLY SITUATED    PLAINTIFFS \n \nv.          MOTION FOR REMEDIAL MEASURES  \n           \nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY \nAND \nJIM LANTRIP INDIVIDUALLY AND \nIN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS JAILER \nOF HOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY  DEFENDANTS \n \n    Come the Defendants, Hopkins County, Kentucky and Jim Lantrip, in his \nindividual and official capacities (hereinafter \"Defendants\"), by and through the \nundersigned counsel, and for their Motion for Remedial Measures hereby state as \nfollows:  \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \n \n  This motion is brought in response to a supplementary notice of class action and \naccompanying questionnaire which was sent by Plaintiffs’ counsel and received by \nnumerous persons, including Donald Corum and Teri Matheny.  (Letter attached hereto \nas Exhibit “A”; Affidavits of Corum and Matheny, attached hereto as Exhibits “B” and \n“C”, respectively).  This notice, which was in the form of a letter on Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \nletterhead (hereinafter the “letter”), was sent on April 14, 2006.  Said letter was not \ndisclosed to Defendants nor approved by this Court.   \n   In this letter, Plaintiffs’ counsel explains the nature of the action and subclasses \n  1\n\ninvolved, notes that the recipient did not respond to a previous notice and again invites \nthe recipient to join the class.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ counsel fabricated a new \ndefinition for the term “strip-search” which is certain to mislead many recipients to \nbelieve that they have a claim when they truly do not.   \n  Despite this Court’s official sanctioning of the definition of the term “strip-\nsearch” for purposes of this action, and without the support of any judicial precedent, \nPlaintiffs’ counsel elected to redefine a “strip-search” as “a search in which you were \nrequired to remove all or part of your clothing by a jail officer so that he/she could \nconduct a visual examination of all or part of your body.”  This letter was clearly a \nmisleading attempt to entice prospective class members to join the action even though \nthey had not truly been strip-searched at the Hopkins County jail.    \nSuch conduct is potentially an ethical violation and is certainly a violation of the \nspirit and express language of Rule 23.  Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to remedial \nmeasures at the expense of Plaintiffs’ counsel and an order prohibiting further contact \nbetween Plaintiffs’ counsel and prospective class members without prior Court approval.   \nII.  DISCUSSION  \nA.  THE PRESENT SOLICITATION LETTER PREJUDICES THE    \n  ENTIRE ACTION BY TAINTING THE MINDS OF PROSPECTIVE  \n  CLASS MEMBERS AND PREVENTING THEIR INDEPENDENT    \n  ANALYSIS OF THE ACTION. \n \n  “Courts are concerned during the period after certification but before the \nexpiration of the exclusion period with the possibility of solicitation or champerty by the \nattorneys for the class representative…”  5 Newberg on Class Actions § 15:15 \n(Thompson/West 2006)(internal citations omitted). \n  An illustration of the reasons for such concern can be found in Impervious Paint \n  2\n\nIndustries, Inc. v. Ashland Oil.1   Although the court in Impervious was adjudicating the \npropriety of contacts initiated by a defendant, the court did set forth rules governing \nplaintiffs’ counsels relating to contact with potential class members.  Regarding the time \nbetween the institution of the class action and the close of the exclusion period, the court \nprovided that “for the purposes of the obligation to avoid unethical solicitation, class \ncounsel must treat the class members as non-clients.”  Id. at 722.   Accordingly, the court \nheld that “it would also appear that contact initiated by class counsel prior to the close of \nthe opt-out period would be unethical as direct solicitation of clients, if the purpose or \npredictable effect of the contact is to discourage a decision to opt out of the class.”  Id.   \n  The court spoke to the rationale for the above holding when it recognized that \n“[i]t is essential that the class members’ decision to participate or to withdraw be made \non the basis of independent analysis of its own self-interest.  It is the responsibility of the \nCourt as a neutral arbiter, and of the attorneys in their adversary capacity, to insure this \ntype of free and unfettered decision.”  Id. at 723.  The court further noted that “[t]he \nmechanism selected for accomplishing this is the class notice, which is designed to \npresent the relevant facts in an unbiased format.”  Id.   \n  It is without question that the potential class members so contacted have had their \ndecision making process tainted by the persuasive and biased nature of the letter.  The \nletter is clearly in contravention to the spirit of Rule 23(b)(3) which requires that potential \nclass members make their decision to participate based upon an independent analysis of \ntheir own self interest.  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s conduct has clearly prejudiced Defendants in \nthat it renders a free and unfettered decision as to the participation of putative class \n                                                 \n  \n \n1 508 F.Supp. 720 (W.D. Ky. 1981).   \n  3\n\nmembers all but impossible.    \nB.  THE SOLICITATION LETTER VIOLATES NOT ONLY THE \n  SPIRIT OF RULE 23(b)(3) BUT ALSO THE EXPRESS PROVISIONS OF \n  RULE 23 REGARDING THE DISSEMINATION OF NOTICE.  \n \n  Fed. R. Civ.P. 23(c)(2)(B) provides that “[f]or any class certified under Rule \n23(b)(3), the court must direct to class members the best notice practicable under the \ncircumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through \nreasonable effort.” (emphasis added).   Leading authorities in the field recognize the \nmandatory nature of the courts obligation by noting that “Rule 23 makes clear that the \ndistrict court has a key role in the provision of notice, mandating that the court shall \ndirect the appropriate notice to members of the class.” McLaughlin on Class Actions at 5-\n408.(emphasis in original).  \n  “The district court has an affirmative obligation in its capacity as fiduciary for \nabsent class members to review the proposed notice to ensure that it meets the \nrequirements of due process.”  Id. at 5-409; citing Schisler v. Hecker, 787 F.2d 76, 86 \n(2d Cir. 1986)(“[T]he district court should examine that notice, and fashion its own more \neffective notice, if necessary.”); Macarz v. Transworld Systems, Inc., 201 F.R.D. 54, 57 \n(D. Conn. 2001)(“The Court bears the responsibility of directing the best notice \npracticable to class members and safeguarding them from unauthorized, misleading \ncommunications from the parties or their counsel.”).  \n  Clearly, it is this Court’s place to orchestrate the class notice in such a way as to \ncomport with the requirements of due process and to guard against abuse of the class \naction by the parties or their counsels by engaging in unauthorized and misleading \ncommunications.  Needless to say, Plaintiffs’ counsel has usurped this Court’s function \n  4\n\nby sending the most recent letter.  Further, Plaintiffs’ counsel has called into question his \nability to adequately represent the class by engaging in the very behavior that this Court \nis responsible for guarding against.  Such behavior is prejudicial to not only the \nDefendants, but to the entire action.  Accordingly, curative measures are required.  \nC.  DEFENDANTS ARE ENTITLED TO CURATIVE MEASURES AT \nPLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL’S EXPENSE. \n \n  The Manual for Complex Litigation provides that “[i]f class members have \nreceived communications containing misinformation or misrepresentations, a curative \nnotice from the court, at the expense of those at fault, may be appropriate.”  Id.  As to the \nnature of some other curative measures, the Manual suggests “extending deadlines for \nopting out, intervening or responding to a proposed settlement, or voiding improperly \nsolicited opt outs.”  Other sanctions, such as disclosure of information gained in violation \nof the attorney-client relationship, contempt and fines, assessment of fees, or in an \negregious situation, the replacement of counsel or of a class representative, may be \njustified.”  Id. \n  This Court is now faced with the challenge of setting right the frame of mind of \npotential class members and of dispelling the self-serving misrepresentations contained in \nPlaintiffs’ counsel’s solicitation letter.  Defendants opine that the prejudice caused can be \nsatisfactorily remedied by a curative notice sent at Plaintiffs’ counsel’s expense to those \npersons who have responded to the April, 2006 notice and letter (apparently 200 or so \nthus far according to Plaintiffs’ counsel).  Additionally, Defendants request that this \nCourt prohibit any further contact with potential class members by Plaintiffs’ counsel \nwithout prior court approval.  \n  Furthermore, in light of the prejudice caused to Defendants by Plaintiffs’ \n  5\n\ncounsel’s actions, Defendants request that this Court order Plaintiffs’ counsel to produce \nto Defendants all other of the same or similar letters sent to potential class members, as \nwell as any and all records of any kind which relate to other communications, or \nattempted communications, by Plaintiffs’ counsel of potential class members, including \n2\nany responses received from said class members.  \n  The propriety of the relief sought by Defendants is supported by the holdings of \n3\nGulf Oil Company v. Bernard,  which provides that an order limiting communications \nbetween parties and potential class member is not an unconstitutional prior restraint when \nsuch order is carefully drawn to limit speech as little as possible and is based upon a clear \nrecord and specific findings that reflect a weighing of the need for a limitation and the \npotential interference with the rights of the parties.  However, what makes the injunctive \nrelief sought all the more proper is the fact that it will not act as a prior restraint on \nspeech at all because it is a measure taken in response to improper contacts which have \nalready occurred.  See Meek, 620 N.E.2d at 986.   \n  The argument that the cost of this Court’s curative measures must be borne by \nPlaintiffs’ counsel is supported by the fact that such conduct is in violation of the ethics \nrules.  Kentucky Supreme Court Rule 3.130(7.01)(1) provides that “ “[a]dvertise” or \n“advertisement” means to furnish any information or communication containing a \nlawyer’s name or other identifying information…” with the exception of a list of \ncommunications enumerated as (a) through (i), none of which apply to the letter by \nPlaintiffs’ counsel.  This letter is clearly an attempt to solicit professional employment \nand constitutes an advertisement.  As such, the letter is governed by SCR 7. \n                                                 \n2 This information is simultaneously sought from Plaintiffs via discovery request.  \n3 452 U.S. 89 (1981).  \n  6\n\n  SCR 3.130(7.07) provides that “[f]or any advertisement on which an advisory \nopinion has not been sought, the Commission, or its designee, shall review such filings \nfor compliance with the Advertising Rules and Advertising Regulations.”  It is assumed \nthat Plaintiffs’ counsel did not submit the present solicitation letter for review by the \nAttorneys’ Advertising Commission, its designee or any other person or entity.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s conduct is in violation of SCR 3.130(7.07).  \n  The solicitation further runs afoul of SCR 3.130(7.09)(3) which requires that the \ncommunication contain the words “THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT” in all capital \nletters.  Such disclosure is to be contained on the “envelope, document or electronic \ndevise in which such communication is transmitted.”    \n  WHEREFORE, for the forgoing reasons, defendants herein, Hopkins County, \nKentucky and Jim Lantrip, in his individual and official capacities, hereby respectfully \nrequest the following relief: \n    a.  That, at the expense of Plaintiffs’ counsel, this Court forward an \nofficial notice to all potential class members who have sent a questionnaire to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel since April 14, 2006, instructing them as to the true legal definition of a strip-\nsearch and other principles to consider in making their determination to participate in the \naction; and \n    b.  A Court order prohibiting upon further contact of potential class \nmembers by Plaintiffs’ counsel without prior court approval; and  \n    c.   A Court order requiring Plaintiffs’ counsel to produce to \nDefendants all responses received from said class members since April 14, 2006.   \n             \n  7\n\n        Respectfully submitted, \nDENTON & KEULER \nP.O.

MAY,\nLADONIA W. WILSON, ROBIN LITTLEPAGE, \nROBERT R. TEAGUE, and TABITHA NANCE\nIndividually and on behalf of all other similarly situated PLAINTIFFS\nV.\nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY and\nJIM LANTRIP, Individually and in his official\ncapacity as Jailer of Hopkins County, Kentucky                DEFENDANTS\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nThis matter is before the Court upon a Sealed Letter and Claim Form filed by Pam Williams\n[DN 487].  Fully briefed, this matter is ripe for decision. \nOn July 11, 2008, the parties reached a settlement agreement in this case.  On August 25,\n2008, the claims administrator, Analytics, Inc., mailed potential class members a Notice of Hearing\nand Proposed Class Action Settlement and Claim Form via first-class mail at her last known address\n[See DN 425].  The notice inform ed potential class members of the October 20, 2008, Fairness\nHearing and of the December 31, 2008, deadline for filing of claim forms.  On October 20, 2008,\nthe Court approved the settlement agreement.  \nOn August 26, 2009, this Court received a letter and claim form from Pamela Williams.\nWilliams’ claim form, dated August 24, 2009, alleges illegal entry and release searches.  In her letter\nto the Court, Williams represents that she was contacted in October of 2008 about the case and she\nexpressed her interest in continuing with her calims against the Defendants.  Additionally, Williams\nindicated that she has moved several times in the last year and did not receive the notice in question.\n\nAccording to Williams, she contacted class counsel recently and was informed by counsel to notify\nthe Court that she had moved. \n“The Court has general equitable power to modify the terms of a class action settlement.”\nIn re Cendant Corp. Prides Litigation, 189 F.R.D. 321, 323 (D.N.J. 1999).  “A Court may assert this\npower to allow late-filed proofs of claim and late-cured proofs of claim.”  Id. (citing In re Agent\nOrange Product Liability Litig. , 689 F. Supp. 1250, 1263 (E.D.N.Y. 1988); The M anual For\nComplex Litig. § 30.47 at 248 (3d ed.1995) (“Adequa te time should be allowed for late claim s\nbefore any refund or other disposition of settlement fund occurs.”)); Grace v. City of Detroit, 145\nF.R.D. 413, 415 (E.D. Mich. 1992) (“The adoption  of the good cause standard [to a deci sion to\naccept untimely claim forms] is ‘an appropriate exercise of the trial court’s discretion in defining\nthe scope of the class action judgment and settlement.’”) (quoting Kyriazi v. Western Elec. Co., 647\nF.2d 388, 396 (3d Cir. 1981)). Courtsc onsidering requests to extend deadlines for filing claim forms\nin class actions frequently analyze these late claims “under the rubric of whether the claimant has\nshown ‘excusable neglect.’” In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation, 246 F.3d\n315, 321 (3d Cir. 2001)(citing In reC endant Corp. Prides Litig., 189 F.R.D. 321, 324 (D.N.J. 1999)).\nSee also Pioneer Inv. Services Co. v. Brunswick Assoc. Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S. 380 (1993); In\nre Cendant Corp. PRIDES Litig., 235 F.3d 176, 180 (3d Cir. 2000); Silvercreek Management, Inc.\nv. Banc of America Securities, LLC, 534 F.3d 469, 472 (5th Cir. 2008). In determining whether a\nclaimant should have the benefit of excusablen  eglect the Court should examine the following four\nfactors: “1) the danger of prejudice to the nonmovant; 2) the length of the delay and its potential\neffect on judicial proceedings; 3) the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the\nreasonable control of the movant; and 4) whether the movant acted in good faith.”  In re Orthopedic\n2\n\nBone Screw Products Liability Litigation, 246 F.3d at 322-323 (citing Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395.).\nBased upon a review of the record and after conidsering the factors set forth above, the Court\nwill permit Williams to submit the late claim form.  Defendants cannot prove harm given that the\noriginal limit of Defendants’ financial obligation has not been expanded.  Similarly, the Court finds\nthat  the eight m onth  delay will not unnecessa rily  prolong these proceedings.  The claim s\nadministrator is currently reviewing one claim and the case has not been closed.  Further, Williams\nrepresents to the Court tha t she did not receive the notice in  question.  Upon learning of the\nsettlement, she promptly submitted the claim form provided by class counsel and a letter of\nexplanation to the Court.  Accordingly, after a review of the above factors, the Court will permit\nWilliams to submit a claim form to the claims administrator.  Class counsel shall provide the Claims\nAdministrator the claim form filed by Williams in this action.  The parties shall adhere to the claims\napproval and appeal process set forth in the settlem ent agreement executed on Jul y 11, 2008.\n(Settlement Agreement ¶¶ 18, 20-23.)  \nDespite Defendants’ arguments, the Court declines to address whether Williams qualifies\nas a class member under either the entry or release class.  However, upon an initial revi ew of\nWilliams’ claim form, the Court foresees a potential factual issue that will need to be addressed by\nthe Claims Administrator.  In answering questions regarding her release strip search claim, Williams\nchecked the answer “Yes” in response to the question, “Did the strip search(es) upon release occur\n. . . [u]pon release from Jail, but before you were transferred to another jail or prison?”  Williams\nqualified this answer by underlining only the portion “[u]pon release from jail.”  Thus, the Claims\nAdministrator will have to determine whether Williams was strip searched upon release from jail\nor, instead, was  strip searched before she was transferred to another jail or prison.\n3\n\nFor these reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that no later than October 23, 2009, class\ncounsel shall provide the Claims Administrator the claim form attached to Pam Williams’ letter. \n   \ncc: counsel of record\n      Pam Williams\n   \n4",

The  Claims  Administrator  will  also  publish  the  Notice  of  Settlement \n(\"Published Notice\") in the Madisonville Messenger, the Louisville Courier-Journal, the \nProvidence Journal Enterprise, the Kentucky New Era, the Dawson Springs Progress, the \nCentral City Leader News, the Owensboro Messenger Inquirer, the Sebree Banner, the \nSturgis News, the Henderson The Gleaner, and the Paducah Sun.

In addition, Defendants have agreed to make \navailable, during the same time frame defined in the prior sentence, to inmates (or anyone \nelse) who requests it, a copy of the Notice of Settlement, and the cost of those copies shall \nbe paid out of the settlement fund and shall be considered part of the cost of administering \nthe settlement and shall not serve to increase Defendants' costs or liabilities under this \nAgreement.\n17.  The Claims Administrator will send a claim form to anyone who requests one \nbefore the time for filing claim forms has expired.  The Claims Administrator will also \nmaintain a toll-free number for claimants to call to request a claim form or with questions.  \nThis number will be operational for at least five months following Court approval of this \nAgreement.\n18.  In order for a class member to claim a share of the settlement, he/she must \nsubmit  to  the  Claims  Administrator  a  valid  and  complete  Settlement  Claim  Form, \npostmarked no later than 60 days following the date of entry of the Court Order approving \n7\n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 418-2    Filed 07/18/08   Page 8 of 15 PageID #:\n 5348\nthis Agreement after the Fed.

Any appeal of such written decision of the Claims Administrator with which \nPlaintiffs or Defendants disagree must be filed with the Court within 15 days of the such \nparty's receipt of the Claims Administrator's written decision. \n19.  In order for a class member to object to the proposed settlement, he/she must \nsubmit a written objection to the Claims Administrator, but such written objection must be \npostmarked not later than October 10, 2008, and must be received by the Claims \nAdministrator prior to the fairness hearing, in order to be considered timely.  The Claims \nAdministrator shall provide copies of all objections to counsel for the parties as soon as \npracticable by mail and/or fax as may be necessary, so that all objections are provided to \ncounsel for the parties prior to the fairness hearing.

APPROVAL AND APPEALS\n20.  The Claims Administrator will review each claim form to determine whether \nthe claimant is a qualifying class member by confirming:  (a) that the Settlement Claim \nForm is timely and valid; (b) that the information on the form is consistent with available \ndata  previously  provided  by  Defendants,  and  supplemented  by  Defendants  in  their \nobjection, if any; and (c) that the form is completely filled out and signed. \n21.  The Claims Administrator may, with knowledge and written consent of \nDefendants, waive a technical defect in a claim form to achieve substantial justice. \n22.  If a claimant does not meet the class definition, the Claims Administrator will \nsend a Notice of Claim Denial to the claimant.

He must \ninclude reliable written documentation, which need not be an official record, that shows that \nhe is a class member, and he may also include a sworn written statement subject to the \npenalty of perjury.  The Claims Administrator will consult with counsel for the parties and \nmake a determination on each appeal no later than 30 days after the deadline for class \nmembers to file such appeals.  The Claims Administrator will inform the class member in \nwriting of its determination, and provide copies to all counsel within 30 days of such \ndetermination.  In order to object to the Claims Administrator’s final determination that he is \n9\n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 418-2    Filed 07/18/08   Page 10 of 15 PageID #:\n 5350\nnot a class member, a claimant must file a written appeal with the Court postmarked no \nlater than 15 days after the date of the mailing of the final Notice of Claim Denial.  Rulings \nby the Claims Administrator may also be appealed by the parties directly to the Court within \n15 days of the receipt of the notice from the Claims Administrator approving or denying the \nclaim.  There shall be no further right of appeal beyond review of the ruling of the Claims \nAdministrator by the Court. \n24.  The Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Approval (“Notice of \nClaim Approval”) to each approved claimant, absent objection, promptly but in no event \nlater than 90 days after the Claims Deadline. \n25.  A claimant who used a different name upon admission to the Jail must \npresent documentation establishing that he/she is the person referred to in Defendants’ \nrecords.\nVIII.

Plaintiffs’  attorneys'  fees  and  litigation  expenses  will  be  paid  from  the \nsettlement funds. \n28.  Class  counsel  will  be  paid  only  the  actual  attorney  fees  and  litigation \nexpenses incurred in this litigation, not to exceed $1.5 million. \n29.  Plaintiffs' litigation expenses and attorney's fee will be calculated and paid \nwithin 30 days of entry of the Order approving this Agreement following the fairness \nhearing.  Claims administration costs, including but not limited to any additional attorney \nfees and expenses incurred by Plaintiffs' counsel after June 9, 2008, will be calculated and \n10\n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 418-2    Filed 07/18/08   Page 11 of 15 PageID #:\n 5351\npaid within 30 days of entry of the Order of Dismissal by the Court.  In addition, any copy \ncosts incurred by Defendants pursuant to the obligation described in ¶16 above will be \nitemized and submitted to the Claims Administrator and counsel for Plaintiffs prior to entry \nof the Order of Dismissal, and will also be paid within 30 days of entry of the Order of \nDismissal.  \nIX.  DISTRIBUTION TO CLASS MEMBERS\n30.  Named class representatives Eddie Sutton and Lester Hank Turner (the first \nand  originating  plaintiffs  in  this  case)  will  receive  $35,000.00  each;  named  class \nrepresentatives Robin Littlepage, Tim May, Tabitha Nance, Ladonia Nelson, Linda Ford \nand Robert Teague $25,000.00 each; and named class representatives Daniel Todd and \nTony  Ward  $15,000.00  each,  in  full  and  final  settlement  of  all  their  claims  against \nDefendants as well as for their service as named class representatives, including but not \nlimited  to  surrendering  their  anonymity,  bringing  suit,  submitting  to  discovery,  and \nparticipating in and authorizing the settlement of this class action as set forth herein, all in \ncomplete satisfaction and discharge of their duties as named class representatives.  Their \nchecks shall issue within 30 days of entry of the Order approving this Agreement following \nthe fairness hearing. \n31.  In addition to the above, all class members who have valid claims, who have \nbeen deposed in these proceedings, and who submit a claim form, shall be paid $4,000.00 \neach in full and final settlement of all their claims against Defendants.  A list identifying \nsuch persons is attached hereto as Appendix A.\n32.  All remaining class members will receive payment from the settlement funds \nthat remain after deducting attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, expenses of claims \n11\n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 418-2    Filed 07/18/08   Page 12 of 15 PageID #:\n 5352\nadministration,  payments  to  class  representatives,  and  payments  to  deposed  class \nmembers.  Persons subjected only to one or more strip-searches on admission to the Jail, \nor one or more strip-searches after they became entitled to release from the Jail, and thus \nare members of only the \"Entry\" Class or the \"Release\" Class, will be paid an amount up to \nbut not exceeding $1500.00, depending upon the number of approved claimants to the \nsettlement fund, in full and final settlement of all their claims against Defendants.  Persons \nsubjected both to one or more strip-searches on admission to the Jail and one or more \nstrip-searches after they became entitled to release from the Jail, and thus are members of \nboth the \"Entry\" Class and the \"Release\" Class, will be paid an amount up to but not \nexceeding $2500.00 depending upon the number of approved claimants to the settlement \nfund, in full and final settlement of all their claims against Defendants. \n33.  The Claims Administrator will calculate the amount of money due each class \nmember by assigning three points to every approved claimant who is a member of only one \nof the certified classes.  Approved claimants who are members of both classes will be \nassigned five points.  The Claims Administrator will divide the amount remaining in the \nsettlement fund (after the payments made as provided  above) by the total number of points \nto determine the amount each approved claimant will receive.  Class members will receive \nonly one payment no matter how many times they were admitted into and/or searched \nwhile incarcerated at the Jail during the class period. \n34.    Each class member’s check will be made payable only in his or her name or, \nupon the death of a class member, to the personal representative of the deceased class \nmember’s estate upon filing an affidavit in compliance with the applicable statutory \nprocedure for collection of personal property by affidavit of the rightful heir.   The check will \n12\n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 418-2    Filed 07/18/08   Page 13 of 15 PageID #:\n 5353\nbe mailed to the class member at their mailing address.  Any change of address request \nmust be made in writing and must be signed by the claimant. \n35.  If a participating class member is confined in a prison, hospital, or other \ninstitution and has provided the address of such institution for payment, the settlement \ncheck will be sent to an appropriate institutional address unless the class member makes \nother acceptable arrangements in writing with the Claims Administrator.  If a claimant’s \ncheck is returned and the Claims Administrator has no record of a forwarding address,  the \nClaims Administrator, after consulting with counsel for the parties, shall have discretion to \ntake reasonable steps to locate such claimant. \nX.  POST-DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION\n36.  Any settlement funds remaining after all payments contemplated by this \nSettlement Agreement have been paid will be returned by the Claims Administrator to \nDefendants. \n 37.    At  the  conclusion  of  the  claims  administration  process,  the  Claims \nAdministrator shall provide a full and complete report to the parties and the Court that will \ninclude: (a) a list of approved claimants and the amounts paid to each; (b) a list of \nindividuals whose claims were rejected by the administrator and the reasons therefor; and \n(c) a detailed accounting of all expenses incurred by and fees of the Claims Administrator.\nXI.  DECEASED CLASS MEMBERS\n38.  If a class member is deceased, a legally authorized representative may file a \nSettlement Claim Form on behalf of the estate.  However, the representative must provide \nto the Claims Administrator the documentation required by ¶ 34 above, as well as a \ncertified  copy  of  the  Probate  Court  order  appointing  the  person  as  the  authorized \n13\n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 418-2    Filed 07/18/08   Page 14 of 15 PageID #:\n 5354\nrepresentative of the deceased class member prior to the claims’ deadline, or the claim will \nbe denied. \nXII.  RELEASE\n39.  In consideration of payment of the settlement amount, Defendants will be \nreleased from all liability for all class members’ claims for all strip- searches that were part \nof this lawsuit including class members who do not file claims, except for any class \nmembers who requested exclusion and filed a claim within the statute of limitations.  The \nparties have expressly agreed that the release of claims arising from the settlement \nincludes all visual inspections, including without limitation visual body cavity inspections, \nthat otherwise fall within the scope of the claims certified as a class action by the Court in \nthis case.  The parties also agree that all such claims against all of Defendants' employees \nand other agents are barred because the settlement expressly covers Defendants, its \nemployees and agents.  Class members will be afforded an opportunity for exclusion as \nprovided for in Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(3), and as specified in the Notice of Settlement which will \nbe submitted to the Court for approval. \n14\n\nCase 4:03-cv-00003-JHM-ERG   Document 418-2    Filed 07/18/08   Page 15 of 15 PageID #:\n 5355\nFor Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class: \nDate: July 17, 2008       /s/ Gregory A.

MAY,\nLADONIA W. WILSON, ROBIN LITTLEPAGE,\nROBERT R. TEAGUE, and TABITHA NANCE\nIndividually and on behalf of all others similarly situated PLAINTIFFS\nVS.\nHOPKINS COUNTY, KENTUCKY and\nJIM LANTRIP, Individually and in his\nofficial capacity as Jailer of Hopkins County,\nKentucky, DEFENDANTS\nMemorandum Of Law In Support Of Plaintiffs’ Response To\nDefendants’ Motion To Dismiss\nI. Introduction\nDefendants have filed a motion to dismiss for three reasons that are not supported by ~\ncontrolling law. Specifically, the Prison Litigation Reform Act - upon which Defendants wholly\nrely for their first two arguments - does not apply to inmates who have been released from jail.\nNo less than eight Courts of Appeals - including the Sixth Circuit - have recognized that the\nPLRA does not apply to the facts of this action (i.e. that the PLRA does not apply to former\nprisoners). See Ahmed v. Dragovich, 297 F.3d 201,210 n.10 (3rd Cir. 2002); see also Thomas v.\nWoolum, 337 F.3d 720, 725 (6th Cir. 2003). Further, even if the PLRA did apply (which it does\nnot), it is well settled that the PLRA does not bar recovery for nominal and punitive damages.\nSee Calhoun v. Detella, 319 F.3d 936, 941 (7th Cir. 2003).\n\nAs for Defendants’ third argument regarding statute of limitations, the United States\nSupreme Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals have been unwavering in their rulings that\nall statutes of limitations are tolled for individual plaintiffs when a class action complaint is filed.\nAmerican Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 411 U.S. 538, 550 (1974); Wyser-Pratte Management v.\nTelxon, 413 F.3d 553 (6th Cir. 2005) (\"the commencement of a class action suspends the\napplicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class.\")\nAccordingly, Defendants’ arguments simply do not apply to the facts of this action and\nare contrary to prevailing and easily obtainable legal authority. Therefore, Plaintiffs respectfully\nrequest that this Court deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss and allow Plaintiffs’ claims to\nproceed to trial.\nII.    Statement Of Facts\nOn January 9, 2003l, Plaintiffs Sutton and Turner filed a complaint in their individual\ncapacity and on behalf of \"all persons arrested for minor offenses who were required by\nDefendants, in the Hopkins County Jail, to remove their clothing for a visual inspection when\nthere was no reasonable grounds for believing that they were concealing weapons or\ncontraband.\" Complaint, ¶ 1. On January 18, 2005, Plaintiffs filed, with leave of this Court,\ntheir First Amended Complaint and added Linda Ford and Timothy May as class representatives.\nUpon joint motion of the parties, on March 16, 2005 the Court subsequently certified two sub-\nclasses of the original broader class: 1) \"all persons arrested for minor offenses who were\nrequired by Defendants in the Hopkins County Jail, after becoming entitled to release, to remove\ntheir clothing for visual inspection (\"release class\")\"; and 2) \"all persons arrested for non-violent,\nnon-drug related misdemeanor offenses who were required by the Defendants to remove their\n~ In their motion to dismiss, Defendants erroneously indicate that Plaintiff’s Original Complaint was filed on\nJanuary 9, 2002. The actual date, as evidenced by the file stamp, is January 9, 2003.\n-2-\n\nclothing for a visual inspection on admission to the Jail (\"entry class\")\". Agreed Order at ¶¶ 2(a)\nand 3. Each sub-class includes all individuals who were treated from January 9, 2002 to the\npresent. Id. On June 3, 2005, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, again with leave\nof this Court, and added plaintiffs Ladonia Nelson, Robin Littlepage, Robert Teague and Tabitha\nNance as additional class representatives. Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, ¶ 2. As\nadmitted by Defendants, all of the additional class representatives - Ford, May, Nelson,\nLittlepage, Teague and Nance - were members of the original class because their claims arose\nbetween January 9, 2002, and the present. Defendants’ Memorandum in Support of Motion to\nDismiss, ¶ I.\nIII. Argument\nA. The Prison Litigation Reform Act Does Not Apply To This Action.\n1. Exhaustion Of Administrative Remedies Is Not Required\nBecause The PLRA Does Not Apply To Former Prisoners.\nThe PLRA does not apply to former inmates or prisoners. Ahmed v. Dragovich, 297\nF.3d 201,210 (3rd Cir. 2002); Greig v. Goord, 169 F.3d 165 (2nd Cir. 1999); Janes v. Hernandez,\n215 F.3d 541, 543 (5th Cir. 2000); Kerr v. Puckett, 138 F.3d 321,323 (7th Cir. 1998); Doe v.\nWashington County, 150 F.3d 920, 924 (8th Cir. 1998); Page v. Torrey, 201 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th\nCir. 2000); Harris v. Garner, 216 F.3d 970, 980 (11th Cir. 2000).\nThe Third Circuit succinctly stated just three years ago: \"We note that every Court of\nAppeals to have considered the issue has held that the PLRA does not apply to actions filed by\nformer prisoners.\" Id. at n.10. (citing to decisions from the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7tla, 8th, 9th, and 11t~\nCircuits) (emphasis added). Further, the Sixth Circuit has recognized that \"exhaustion applies\nonly to those who are currently detained, not former prisoners.\" Thomas v. Woolum, 337 F.3d\n720, 725 (6th Cir. 2003) quoting in parenthetical, Page, 201 F.3d at 1139. The PLRA provides\n-3-\n\nthat \"[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1979 of the\nRevised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983), or any other Federal law, by a prisoner\nconfined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are\navailable are exhausted.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (emphasis added) The PLRA specifically defines\n\"prisoner\" as \"any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted\nof, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and\nconditions of parole, probation pretrial release, or divisionary program.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(h)\n(emphasis added). Thus, as the Seventh Circuit eloquently articulated:\nThe statutory language does not leave wiggle room; a convict out on parole is not\na \"person incarcerated or detained in any facility\"... [m]ost sections of the PLRA\nuse the term \"prisoner,\" and...this term does not comprehend a felon who has\nbeen released.\nKerr v. Puckett, 138 F.3d at 323. (internal citations omitted).\nMoreover, the Ninth Circuit has stated, \"the natural reading of the text is that, to fall\nwithin the definition of \"prisoner,\" the individual in question must be currently detained. Page,\n210 F.3d at 1139. Therefore, former prisoners who file prison condition actions are no longer\n\"prisoners\" and need not satisfy the exhaustion requirements of this provision. Greig, 169 F.3d\nat 167; Page, 201 F.3d at 1140 (holding that the PLRA does not apply to former prisoners and\naccordingly neither does the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement).\nThe legal justification for the precedent is simple. Congress enacted the PLRA to\n\"reduce quantity and improve quality of prisoner suits.\" Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002).\n\"Congress deemed prisoners to be pestiferous litigants because they have so much free time on\ntheir hands and there are few costs to filing suit.\" Kerr, 138 F.3d. at 323. All circuits holding\nthat the PLRA does not apply to former prisoners agree on the policy considerations driving the\nPLRA’s enactment, namely litigant-happy inmates with nothing better to do with their time than\n-4-\n\nfile lawsuits. Several of those circuits similarly agree that this consideration becomes markedly\nless of a concern following release. See Harris, 216 F.3d at 980 ([b]ut the provision [§ 1997e(e)]\nreflects Congress’ belief that because of the difference in opportunity costs, a substantial number\nof such claims will not be re-filed after release... [t]hat is the judgment Congress made about\nwhat the difference in opportunity costs between inmates and former inmates would mean.);\nGreig, 169 F.3d at 167. Specifically, \"[o]pportunity costs of litigation rise following release,\ndiminishing the need for special precautions against weak suits. Kerr, 138 F.3d at 323.\nDefendants, however, failed to make this Court aware of these important legal\nprecedents, and instead only cited to irrelevant cases that only involved inmates who remained\nincarcerated. See Booth v. Churner, 532 U .S. 731 (2001) (action filed while plaintiff was still\nincarcerated); Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002) (same); Freeman v. Berge, 283 F.Supp.2d\n1009 (W.D.Wis., 2003) (same); Boyd v. Corrections Corp. of America, 380 F.3d 989, 991 (6th\nCir. 2004) (same); Knuckles El v. Toombs, 215 F.3d 640 (6th Cir. 2000) (same).\nThus, Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative\nremedies under § 1997e(e) fails as a matter of law because Plaintiffs, as former inmates, are not\nsubject to the PLRA and were therefore not required to exhaust administrative remedies before\nbringing this action. Every one of Plaintiffs’ class representatives have been released from jail\nand Defendants have failed to identify any members of either sub-class who would not be a\nmember of their class. Finally, Defendants specifically requested this Court to certify the sub-\nclasses as including any inmate, regardless of whether the inmates have been released. See\nAgreed Order Executed by John Soyars, Defendants’ Counsel March 16, 2005. Defendants\ntherefore should be estopped from now bringing this argument. Because the PLRA does not\n-5-\n\napply to the facts of this action, Defendants’ argument relating to exhaustion of remedies is to no\navail.\n2. Even If The PLRA Applied To This Action (Which It Does Not), Plaintiffs\nCan Recover Nominal And Punitive Damages For Violation Of Their\nConstitutional Rights By Defendants.\nPlaintiffs’ ability to recover compensatory damages likewise is not limited by the PLRA\nbecause, in accordance with the authority stated above, the PLRA does not apply to former\nprisoners. Therefore, Defendants’ motion to dismiss on this argument also must be denied.\nHowever, even if the PLRA does apply (which it does not), it is not a complete bar to\nrecovery, but rather, is only a limitation on recovery available to Plaintiffs. Calhoun v. Detella,\n319F.3d 936. 940 (7th Cir. 2003). Although the PLRA might bar recovery of compensatory\ndamages for mental and emotional injuries suffered without a showing of personal injury, the\nstatute is inapplicable to awards of nominal or punitive damages for Constitutional violations.\nId. at 941; Searles v. Van Bebber, 251 F.3d 869, 878-880 (10th Cir. 2001); Thompson v. Carter,\n284 F.3d 411,418 (2nd Cir. 2002). As the Third Circuit articulated in Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d\n523,533 (3rd Cir. 2003):\nSection 1997e(e)’s requirement that a prisoner demonstrate physical injury before\nhe can recover for mental or emotional injuries applies only to claims for\ncompensatory damages. Claims seeking nominal or punitive damages are\ntypically not \"for\" mental or emotional injury but rather \"to vindicate\nconstitutional rights\" or \"to deter or punish egregious violations of constitutional\nrights,\" respectively.\n(internal citations omitted).\nDefendants’ argument that Plaintiffs’ would need to plead and prove physical injury is\nnonsensical, as explained by the Seventh Circuit:\n\"It]his contention if taken to its logical extreme would give prison officials free\nreign to maliciously and sadistically inflict psychological torture on prisoners, so\nlong as they take care not to inflict any physical injury in the process.\n-6-\n\nld. at 940.\nRegardless, Defendants tender this argument without citation to any legal authority other\nthan the statute in question. As evidenced above, however, recovery for nominal and punitive\ndamages for Constitutional violations, even in the absence of physical injury, is consistent with\nthe law. In both their Original Complaint and their Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs\nalleged numerous Constitutional violations arising from the improper strip-searches. Complaint,\n¶ 15 and Second Amended Complaint, ¶ 26. Thus, even if the PLRA would apply (which it does\nnot), the law is well settled that Plaintiffs can still recover nominal and punitive damages for the\nviolations of their Constitutional rights. Accordingly, Defendants’ argument that recovery is\ncompletely barred fails and their motion to dismiss must be denied.\nB. The Statute Of Limitations Is Tolled For All Class Members.\nDefendants’ statute of limitations argument is even more puzzling than their PLRA\narguments. The United States Supreme Court could not have been more clear when it espoused\nmore than 30 years ago that the statute of limitations is toiled for all potential class members\nwhen a class action complaint is filed. American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 411 U.S. 538, 550\n(1974) (\"The filing of a timely class action complaint commences the action for all members of\nthe class subsequently determined.\"); Crown, Cork & Seal Co., 462 U.S. 345, 352-53 (1983);.\nThe Sixth Circuit concurs, holding that \"the commencement of a class action suspends the\napplicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class.\" Wyser-Pratte\nManagement v. Texlon, 413 F.3d 553 (6th Cir. 2005).\nThe first paragraph of Plaintiffs’ original complaint states that Plaintiffs Sutton and\nTurner \"file this action...on behalf of all persons arrested for minor offenses who were required\nby Defendants in the Hopkins County Jail to remove their clothing for a visual inspection despite\n-7-\n\nthe absence of any reasonable grounds for believing they were concealing weapons or\ncontraband.\" Complaint, ¶ 1. The third paragraph succinctly states: \"The class consists of all\npersons arrested for minor offenses who were required by Defendants, in the Hopkins County\nJail, to remove their clothing for a visual inspection when there was no reasonable grounds for\nbelieving that weapons or contraband had been concealed on or in their bodies.\" Id. at ¶ 3.\nFurther, the Agreed Order entered into in this action on March 16, 2005 (to which Defendant’s\nspecifically agreed), divided that overall class into two subclasses: one for all persons arrested\nfor minor offenses who were required to remove their clothing after being entitled to release\n(\"release class\"); and a second subclass for all persons arrested for non-violent, non-drug related\nmisdemeanor offenses who were improperly required to remove their clothing (\"entry class\").\nDefendants’ argument that the additional class representatives’ claims are not actionable\nunder the applicable statute of limitations is simply wrong. Defendants ignore the simple fact\nthat the additional class representatives were part of the original class. In their motion to dismiss,\nDefendants do not dispute that the additionally named plaintiffs’ alleged strip-searches all .took\nplace after January 9, 2002. This Court expressly certified the class, upon agreement by\nDefendants, to include \"all individuals who were so treated from January 9, 2002 to the present.\"\nAgreed Order at ¶ 4. The additional class representatives, as named in the amended complaints,\nare therefore members of the original class. Therefore, the binding authority of this Court makes\nclear that the statute of limitations on their claims are tolled and included in the overall class.\nIV. Conclusion\nThis action has been on the Court’s docket for nearly three years. During that time,\nPlaintiffs have spent thousands of hours filing three complaints, hiring experts and drafting\nreports, gathering detailed information on over 7,000 inmates, mailing questionnaires to each of\n-8-\n\nthose former inmates, answering written discovery, preparing for and attending depositions and\nappearing at a mutually agreed upon mediation during which Defendants’ requested that\nPlaintiffs perform even more costly discovery before they would agree to seriously discuss\nsettlement. Defendants’ have agreed to a discovery schedule, which ends December 15, 2005 -\nand already have agreed to class certification as the most judicially effective manner in which to\nproceed with this litigation.\nNow, nearly two months before the close of discovery, Defendants have filed a motion to\ndismiss that is so inaccurate in its legal reasoning and analysis that it has accomplished nothing\nmore than to delay, harass and cause Plaintiffs to needlessly expend even more time and money\non this action. Defendants’ actions are so lacking in legal justification that Plaintiffs requested\nthat Defendants withdraw their motion to limit the needless expense Plaintiffs would incur in\nopposing it. Defendants rebuffed this request out of hand without even considering the legal\nprecedent cited by Plaintiffs; instead immediately responding via paralegal that Defendant’s\ncounsel was out of town but, nevertheless, would not withdraw the motion. See Correspondence\nfrom Bart L. Greenwald to Stacey Blankenship, faxed on October 11, 2005, and Correspondence\nfrom Debbie Albritton, paralegal to Stacey Blankenship, to Bart Greenwald, October 11, 2005,\ncollectively attached as Exhibit A.\nNone of Defendants’ grounds for dismissal survive even a cursory review of the relevant\nauthority. First, the PLRA does not apply to the facts of this action. It cannot be made clearer\nthat former prisoners are not subject to any provision of the PLRA, which renders moot\nDefendants’ arguments regarding Defendants’ duty to exhaust administrative remedies and\nPlaintiffs’ need to plead and prove physical injury. Second, even if the PLRA did apply (which it\ndoes not) Plaintiffs can still recover nominal and punitive damages for Constitutional violations.\n-9-\n\nFinally, Defendants’ statute of limitations argument is not only specious but also patently\nincorrect. All Plaintiffs named in the amended complaints are members of the class identified in\nthe original, timely filed, complaint and the subsequent class certification and therefore the\nstatute of limitations is tolled as to all their claims. For these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully\nrequest that this Court deny Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss and allow Plaintiffs to proceed with\ntheir action.\nRespectfully submitted,\nFROST BROWN TODD, LLC\nBart L.
