    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit is one of several cases arising from immigration raids conducted by federal authorities at Swift meat packing plants throughout the country on December 12, 2006.  [See Valenzuela v. Swift Beef Company, Inc., IM-TX-19; Swift & Company v. ICE, IM-TX-20; and United Food and Commercial Workers Int'l Union v. Chertoff, IM-TX-23].  During the operation, federal immigration authorities raided six Swift plants and swept up about twelve thousand meatpacking workers, thousands of which were members of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW).</p><p>In this case, which was filed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on December 13, 2006 in U.S. District Court District of Colorado, the UFCW sought the release of Swift employees and union members detained during the raid at the Swift plant in Greeley, Colorado.  Plaintiffs alleged that they were being subjected to arbitrary prolonged and indefinite detention, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  Plaintiffs further alleged that they were denied access to counsel.</p><p>The District Judge (Senior Judge John L. Kane) immediately issued an order to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus should not be granted.  The government responded by denying petitioners' allegations and asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter and that the UFCW lacked standing to bring the action. </p><p>On December 28, 2006 Judge Kane amended the show cause order to permit the release of petitioners on bond or on their own recognizance. The government was also allowed to remove alien petitioners from the U.S. who requested voluntary removal. Petitioners were subsequently granted leave to add 252 additional individual detainees as named parties.</p><p>On January 12, 2007, the District Court (Judge Kane) heard arguments of the parties and then issued an order requiring the government to provide a bond hearing within 48 hours for any detainee not previously afforded one. The government was also ordered to allow any detainee to withdraw their agreement to voluntary removal, if the detainee claimed it was fraudulently or wrongfully obtained.  Petitioners' attorneys were directed to meet with their clients and the parties were to report back to the Court with a status report.</p><p>Following a status report on January 22, 2007,  Judge Kane concluded that the government had complied with the Court's order and corrected the constitutional violations.  Final judgment was entered in favor of petitioners against the government on January 25, 2007 and the case was closed.</p><p></p>",

Fragu, José Chavez, \nAdam  M.  Flores,  Rinald  Dirrato,  Arrestada  Joy  Aspose,  Kimberly \nCordova,  Roberto  Burgos  Roman,  Rudy  Hernadez,  Lionel  Vicente \nChum, Juan Vela, and Marquerez Barron, and others similarly situated \nseek the Great Writ. They act on their own and through their Next \nFriend, United Food and Commercial Workers Local No. 7. They are \nbeing held incommunicado in respondents’ unlawful custody. \n \nI. \nJURISDICTION \n1.  Petitioners bring this action under 28 USC §2241 and §2242.  \n2.  This  Court  is  empowered  under  28  USC  §2241  and  §2242  to \ngrant the Writ of Habeas Corpus and to declare the rights of the \nparties herein. \nII. \nVENUE \n3.  The events leading to this petition have all taken place within the \nDistrict of Colorado. \nIII. \nPARTIES \n4.  Petitioners  are  employed  as  production  employees  at  Swift  & \nCompany located in Greeley, Colorado.   \n5.  United  Food  &  Commercial  Workers  Local  Union  No.  7, \nPetitioners’ Next Friend, represents the production employees at \nthe  Swift  Plant  in  Greeley,  Colorado  in  employment  matters \nregarding terms and conditions of employment. \n6.  Julie L. Meyers is Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security for \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement. \n7.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is believed to \nhave petitioners in custody. \n  4\n\nIV. \nEvents \n8.  Petitioners appear to have been taken into custody by the U.S. \nCitizenship  and  Immigration  Services  on  December  12,  2006 \nfrom their place of employment. \n9.  The number of Petitioners taken into custody is not specifically \nknown.  Based  on  the  observation  of  persons  at  the  scene  it \nappears that approximately two hundred persons were seized. \n10.  According to accounts in various media, Petitioners were taken \ninto custody because of investigations relating to identity theft. \nAccording  to  the  website  of  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration \nServices: \n “WASHINGTON, D.C. – This morning, special \nagents  from  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs \nEnforcement  (ICE)  executed  civil  search \nwarrants  at  six  facilities  owned  by  Swift  & \nCompany. The operation is part of a worksite \nenforcement investigation that has identified a \nlarge identity theft scheme that has victimized \nlarge  numbers  of  U.S.  citizens  and  lawful \nresidents. Swift  is  a  nationwide  processor  of \nfresh beef and pork.” \n11.  Petitioners were not taken to a place of incarceration in Greeley, \nColorado. The whereabouts of Petitioners is unknown. \n12.  It is not known whether Petitioners have been charged with any \ncrime. \n13.  The Next Friend of Petitioners has not been notified of the place \nof  petitioners’  incarceration.  Further,  despite  inquiries  at  the \nplace of employment, the Next Friend of Petitioners has not been \nable to determine the location of Petitioners or the basis for their \nincarceration. Numerous efforts were made by counsel retained \nto  assist  Petitioners  to  determine  where  Petitioners  are  being \nheld  by  contacting  an  ICE  facility  in  Aurora,  Colorado,  the \nDenver  office  of  the  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement \ndivision,  the  Denver  offices  of  the  U.S.  Citizenship  and \nImmigration  Services.  Counsels  were  advised  that  the \nwhereabouts of the petitioners were unknown. \n  5\n\nV. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n14.  Petitioners incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 – 13. \n15.  Respondents  are  liable  for  the  conduct  of  the  agencies  they \nadminister. \n16.  By the actions described above, respondents, acting under color \nof law, have violated and continue to violate the right of the \ndetained  petitioners  to  be  free  from  arbitrary  prolonged  and \nindefinite detention, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  Constitution  of  the \nUnited States. \n17.  To the extent that Petitioners’ detention is without basis in law or \nfact and violates common law principles of due process and the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, \nPetitioners’ detention is unlawful. \n18.  Respondents  have  violated  Petitioners’  right  to  consult  with \ncounsel  by  denying  them  access  to  counsel  or  any  means  to \nobtain counsel in a prompt and effective manner. \n19.  Accordingly, Petitioners are entitled to habeas, declaratory and \ninjunctive relief as well as any other relief the court may deem \nappropriate, including but not limited to immediate release, an \nopportunity  to  meet  with  counsel  and  have  confidential \ncommunications  and  be  fully  advised  of  their  right  to  remain \nsilent and have counsel. \n20.  Petitioners further request that this Court grant such other relief \nas the Court may deem necessary and appropriate to protect \nPetitioners’  rights  under  the  common  law,  the  United  States \nConstitution, and federal statutory law. \nRespectfully submitted on this 13th day of December, 2006. \n  6\n\n \nCounsel for Petitioners \n and Petitioners’ Next Friend \n \n              s/ John Bowen       \nJohn P.

MYERS, Assistant \nSecretary for Homeland Security, \nRespondent.\n                                            \nRESPONDENT’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN RESPONSE TO THE ORDER\nTO SHOW CAUSE\nRespondent Julie L. Myers, Assistant Secretary, United States Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) respectfully responds to the Court’s December 13 Order to\nShow Cause.\nINTRODUCTION \nUnited Food and Commercial Workers Union Local No. 7 (“Union”) has filed a\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of individuals they believe were taken into\ndetention during a worksite enforcement action by ICE.  The worksite enforcement action\nwas predicated on an ICE investigation which revealed that a significant number of workers\nat Swift & Company’s (“Swift”) Greeley, Colorado compound were illegal aliens and had\nillegally obtained employment by stealing the identities of United States citizens and lawful\n\npermanent residents.  In bringing this case, the Union has identified applicants by using those\nfalse identities.\nProcedural Background\nApplicants are allegedly individuals who purportedly were taken into detention by ICE\nOfficers during a worksite enforcement action at the Swift meatpacking plant compound in\nGreeley, Colorado on December 12, 2006.  Petition at ¶ 4.  On December 8, 2006, ICE\napplied for and was granted a civil administrative search warrant by United States District\nCourt Judge Figa to assess the citizenship and immigration status of the Swift employees.\nExhibit 1, Declaration of Paul Maldonado, Supervisory Special Agent, ICE (“Maldonado\nDecl.”) at ¶ 2.  The appropriate cause shown for the warrant was the culmination of a\nnationwide ICE investigation that led to the justifiable suspicion that a large number of Swift\nemployees were illegally in the United States and working without permission by using\nstolen  identities.    Id.    The  search  warrant  was  served  on  December  12,  2006,  at\napproximately 7:30 a.m. on Swift beef plant manager Bill Danley, who informed ICE that\nthere were approximately 1400 employees on that shift between the two plants (one beef, one\nlamb).  Id. at ¶¶ 2, 3.  He provided a list of all employees scheduled for work that day.  After\ndiscussing the operation with Mr. Danley, ICE decided to conduct the survey of the\ncitizenship or immigration status of the beef plant employees in the beef plant cafeteria,\nwhich holds approximately 700 people.  Id. at ¶ 3.   Swift management then brought\n2\n\napproximately 700 people in groups to the beef plant cafeteria, and rotated in additional\nemployees as the initial entrants completed their survey and made cafeteria space available.\nId. at ¶ 4.  No workers were prevented from leaving the area.  Id. at ¶ 11.  All announcements\nmade by ICE during the survey were done in English and Spanish to ensure each individual\nwas advised of what was going on.  Id. at ¶ 4. \nUpon entry into the cafeteria, an announcement was made by ICE (in both English and\nSpanish) requesting that all employees who were born in the United States move to one side\nof the cafeteria, and the remaining employees were asked to move to a different area of the\ncafeteria.  Id. at ¶ 5.  The remaining employees were further separated into two groups based\non their representations of working with immigration documentation and working without\nimmigration documentation.  Id.  \nICE agents then conducted interviews, limited to eliciting background information,\nof each Swift employee to determine each employee’s nationality and immigration status.\nId. at ¶ 7.  ICE agents conducted each interview in either Spanish or English, whichever was\nmost appropriate considering the language most fluently spoken by the employee.  Id.  The\nemployees found to be credibly claiming United States citizenship were asked to return to\nwork as soon as it was safe to do so.  Id.  The noncitizen employees claiming to have lawful\nstatus were interviewed and, if they were determined to be lawfully present, were also asked\nto return to work.   Id.  If certain employees needed immigration documents outside the\n3\n\nfacility to confirm their lawful status, these employees were allowed to contact family and\nfriends by telephone to bring those documents to the Swift plant, and present them to the ICE\nagents at the gate.  If and when ICE agents received confirming documentation of the\nemployee’s lawful, work-authorized immigration status, that employee was then instructed\nto return to work.  Id. \nUndocumented employees were advised of what was happening to them, placed in\nhandcuffs and escorted to the buses waiting outside the plant.  Id. at ¶ 8.  When a bus was\nfull, it departed for the Denver Federal Center, a processing center located in Lakewood,\nColorado.  Id.  ICE repeated this process until all of the approximately 1,400 employees were\ninterviewed.  Id. at ¶ 9.  ICE provided a list of all employees arrested to Mr. Dwayne\nNewkirk, Director of Human Resources for Swift.  Id.\nThere were no locked doors, and no one was prevented from leaving the area.   Id. at\n¶ 10.  Officers ensured that the employees entered the cafeteria in a safe and orderly fashion\nand had properly stored their meatpacking tools, many of which were dangerous objects.  Id.\nat ¶ 11.  Officers did not frisk the employees or act in anything but a calm and courteous\nmanner so as to facilitate the safest environment possible.  Id. at ¶ 10.  A Swift management\nteam was present during the entire vetting and questioning period.  Id. at ¶ 12. Public\ntelephones were available for those aliens who wanted to contact family members or friends\nwho could bring evidence of lawful status or simply to make calls.  Id. at ¶ 6.  There were\n4\n\nno reports or observations of anyone requesting counsel during this period, and no counsel\ncame to meet any individual clients because no employee requested counsel.  Id. at ¶ 12.\nThis same procedure was followed at the lamb processing plant with approximately 130\nemployees.  Id. at ¶¶ 13-16.  \nA total of 260 aliens working without proper work authorization were arrested at the\ntwo Swift plants.  Id. at ¶ 17.  The first bus carrying undocumented aliens arrived at the\nDenver Federal Center at approximately 12:00 noon.  Id. at ¶ 17.  While still on the buses,\nICE officers, whose native language is Spanish, orally advised the aliens, in Spanish or\nEnglish as necessary, of their rights (including the reason for their arrest, the right to a\nhearing  before  an  immigration  judge,  the  right  to  contact  an  attorney,  the  right  to\ncommunicate with the consular officers from their countries) and options in proceeding with\nthe resulting immigration charges.  Id.1 \n     1  Aliens who do not want to return to their native country voluntarily, or who are not\noffered the privilege of voluntary return, based on their criminal history or immigration\nrecord, are ordinarily detained pending a decision of whether to issue a Notice to Appear\nbefore an immigration judge.  ICE has at least forty-eight hours, according to regulation, to\ndecide whether to issue a Notice to Appear and to arrange the appropriate charges to be\nstated in the Notice.  See 8 C.F.R. § 287.3.  If ICE decides to issue the Notice to Appear, the\nNotice is drafted and the alien is served with a copy as soon as practicable.  On some\noccasions, aliens who are not offered voluntary departure still want to return to their home\ncountries as soon as possible, and these aliens may sign a stipulated order of removal.  In this\norder, the alien is provided with a full list of his or her rights in a removal proceeding (in\nEnglish and Spanish), those rights are read orally, in Spanish if appropriate, and the alien\nchooses to waive his or her right to an in-person appearance before an immigration judge,\nin the interest of speeding up his or her removal.  Finally, aliens who have previously been\n5\n\nICE agents began the administrative processing within approximately 15 minutes of\nthe first bus’s arrival at the Denver processing center.  Id. at ¶ 18.  ICE agents asked the\ngroup of aliens whether they ever had contact with immigration officers previously or had\nbeen convicted of a crime.  ICE agents instructed aliens who responded affirmatively to go\nto the rear of the bus.  Id.  ICE agents then took the other aliens, who did not have prior\nrecords, off the bus first and provided them the opportunity to voluntarily return to their\nnative Mexico, an alternative which allows the aliens to return to their countries as soon as\npossible  without  a  hearing.    All  Mexican  nationals  requesting  voluntary  return  were\ndetermined to be non-criminals with no prior immigration contact.  Id.  Approximately 75\naliens requested voluntary return to Mexico and were returned that same evening, at\nGovernment  expense,  after  completion  of  processing  which  included  entry  of  their\nbiographical data into the immigration data bases and completion of the I-826.  Id.  ICE\nagents then processed the remaining aliens as noted below.\nThe Denver Federal Center processing facility was divided into four stations, and each\nalien started in the first station and then proceeded through the rest.  Id. at ¶ 20. The first\nremoved from the U.S. and who have entered illegally, or who have been convicted of\naggravated felonies and are not permanent residents, may be subject to alternative forms of\nremoval.  The aliens who have previously been removed from the U.S. and reentered illegally\nare subject to reinstatement of a prior removal order.  Aggravated felons are subject to an\nexpedited administrative removal proceeding.  In both of these cases, the alien may be\nordered removed without an immigration judge’s involvement.  Maldonado Decl. at ¶ 19.\n6\n\nstation was to search IDENT, an automatic fingerprint identification database.  Id.  IDENT\nis used to retrieve records (including photographs and aliases) of aliens ICE has previously\nencountered.  Id.  At the second station  an ICE agent again gave each alien of his or her\nrights in writing (in Spanish and English); gave each alien his or her Miranda rights; and\nmade sure each alien completed the biographic portion of his or her Deportable Alien Record\n(I-213).  Id.  Afterwards, ICE agents then gave each alien an alien registration number (an\nA-number) and an A-file, and asked the alien to wait until there was an opening at the\ninterview station (the third station).  At the interview station, an agent conducted an in-depth\ninterview, completed the form I-213, and issued a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) (the charging\ndocument).  Id.  At the fourth and final station, a Spanish-speaking agent explained to, and\nserved on the alien the NTA, the Warrant of Arrest (form I-200), and the Notice of Custody\nDetermination (form I-286, advising the alien of custody, bond, and right to reconsideration\nof custody by an immigration judge), and a list of local legal organizations.  Id.  The agent\nagain explained to the alien his or her rights, and answered the alien’s questions.  Id.  After\ncompleting processing, the agent turned over the alien to ICE Detention and Removal\nOfficers present at the processing area, who then placed the alien (and his or her bag of\npossessions) on the bus.  Id. at ¶ 24.  As each bus was filled, it left for the detention centers.\nId. \nDuring processing at the Denver Federal Center, ICE agents did not deny any\n7\n\nrequests for attorneys, and did not deny any attorneys access to their clients.  Id. at ¶ 23.\nOnly one alien requested to speak to an attorney, and that alien was released because he was\nalready in deportation or removal proceedings.  Id.  ICE agents offered use of their cell\nphones to any aliens who requested to use phones at the processing center.  ICE agents\nhonored all requests by the aliens to use bathroom facilities.  Id.  ICE provided liquids and\ntwo meals for each detainee during the process.  No notable adverse incidents occurred\nbetween the aliens or between the aliens and ICE officers.  Id.  ICE agents completed\nprocessing at approximately 2:00 a.m., December 13, 2006.  Id.\nAfter completing processing, ICE transported the aliens to detention centers.  Id. at\n¶ 24.  ICE sent the majority of the aliens to ICE’s contract detention facility in Aurora.  Id.\nHowever, because beds at the Aurora facility are limited, ICE also transported aliens to the\nPark County Jail and the Otero County Prison Facility in Chaparral, Colorado.  Id. \nThe aliens complicated the process by providing various names.  Id. at ¶ 22.  In some\ncases, up to five different names have been associated with one alien.  Id.  Due to the\ndifficulties of finding an alien’s proper identification, ICE has been able to confirm that only\nseven of the thirteen individuals named by the Union have been in ICE custody to date, and\nan eighth name is believed to refer to one of the seven individuals already identified.  Id.\nICE voluntarily returned Juan Diego Gomez-Tejeda, who has been identified as using the\nname “Rinaldo Yarrito,” to Mexico on the evening of December 12, 2006.  (“Rinald Dirrato”\n8\n\nis likely the same person.)  Id.  ICE also voluntarily returned Juan Bocanegra-Tejera, who\nhas been identified as using the name “Carlos Perez,” to Mexico on the evening of December\n12, 2006.  Id.  ICE took Maria Fraga (identified as “Maria E. Fragu”) into custody on\nDecember 12, but transferred her to the Weld County Sheriff later that same evening\npursuant to an active warrant for her arrest (based on identity theft charges) under the stolen\nidentity of “Vanesa Cadaveo.”  Id.  ICE booked Jose Isaias Chevez-Navarro, who has been\nidentified as using the name “José Chavez,” into the Aurora detention facility on the evening\nof December 12 (or in the early morning on December 13), and he remains at that facility\npending removal proceedings.  Id.  ICE initially transferred Fermin Paiz-Garcia, identified\nas using the name “Adam M. Flores,” to El Paso on December 13, but ICE returned him to\nColorado.  ICE has detained Mr. Paiz-Garcia at Aurora, pending a removal hearing.  Id.  ICE\npreviously removed Pedro Vicente-Sontay, identified as using the name “Roberto Burgos\nRoman,” from the United States under the name “Pedro Pablo Perez.”  ICE initially\ntransferred him to El Paso on December 13, but has returned him to Colorado.    ICE has\ndetained Mr. Vicente-Sontay at Aurora, pending a removal hearing.  Id.  ICE also initially\ntransferred Fabian Anaya, identified as using the name “Lionel Vicente Chum,” to El Paso\non December 13, but has also returned him to Colorado.  ICE has detained Mr. Anaya at\nAurora, pending a removal hearing. Id.  ICE has not been able to match the remaining five\nnames to individuals detained at the Greeley plant.  Id.\n9\n\nOn December 13, 2006, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local No. 7\n(“Union”) filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming to represent thirteen\nindividuals as a next friend.  On the same date, the Court ordered Respondents to show cause\nwhy the writ should not issue on or before December 18, 2006; directed that “the applicants\nshall remain in custody and within the jurisdiction of this court until further order;” and\ninstructed the applicants to file a brief in support of their petition (also due on December 18,\n2006).\n DISCUSSION\nThis Court should deny the applicants’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus because\nthis Court does not have proper jurisdiction over respondent and because the petitioner Union\ndoes not have standing as next friend, and applicants and the Union have failed to exhaust\nadministrative remedies.  Further, even if the Court finds it has jurisdiction and the Union\nhas standing as a next friend, the applicants fail to state a claim on which relief may be\ngranted, as the government provided applicants with the requisite due process protections.\nIn any event, the Court should make clear in its disposition that the petition applies only to\nthe thirteen named applicants, as the applicants do not seek to certify a class, and the action\ncannot be maintained as a class action in any case. \nThe Tenth Circuit has held that “[t]he deference due an administrative determination\nhinges not simply on the petitioners' ability to proceed under the habeas statutes, but rather\n10\n\non the realm of the agency's authority and the nature of the petitioners' dispute.”  Marczak\nv. Greene, 971 F.2d 510, 516 (10th Cir., 1992).    As excluded aliens have no constitutional\nright to be paroled into this country, the scope of review of an ICE decision is therefore\nunrelated to a review the court would undertake were a convicted criminal claiming a\nviolation of constitutional rights. “In immigration matters, the scope of judicial review on a\npetition for habeas corpus is more truncated than in the criminal context.”  Amanullah v.\nNelson, 811 F.2d 1, 16 (1st Cir.1987).  The standard of review of agency action is the same\nfor the reviewing district court as it is for this court; the review of agency action is deferential\nto the agency, and lacks the customary deference to the district court. Marczak, 917 F.2d at\n516 (citing Webb v. Hodel, 878 F.2d 1252, 1254 (10th Cir.1989); Mason v. Brooks, 862 F.2d\n190, 192 (9th Cir.1988).\nI. THE  PETITION  DOES  NOT  NAME  THE  PROPER  CUSTODIAN-\nRESPONDENT.\nThe Supreme Court made clear that, in cases challenging physical custody, \"the\nimmediate custodian, not a supervisory official who exercises legal control, is the proper\nrespondent.\"  Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 439 (2004); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2243\n(\"The writ, or order to show cause, shall be directed to the person having custody of the\nperson detained.\");  Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court, 410 U.S. 484, 494-95 (1973)\n(“The writ of habeas corpus does not act upon the prisoner who seeks relief, but upon the\nperson who holds him in what is alleged to be unlawful custody.”); see also Macias v.\n11\n\nGreene, 28 F. Supp. 2d 635, 637 (D. Colo. 1998) (holding “[t]he proper respondent to a\nhabeas action is the habeas petitioner’s custodian.”).  More specifically, for \"physical\nconfinement\" habeas actions, the proper respondents are the wardens of the facilities where\nthe habeas petitioners are being held.  Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. at 435.  This is logical because the\nwrit acts against the person who has \"day-to-day control over [the] prisoner.\" Brittingham\nv. United States, 982 F.2d 378, 378 (9th Cir. 1992); see also Ex Parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283,\n306 (1944) (writ is directed to prisoner’s “jailer”); Guerra v. Meese, 786 F.2d 414, 416 (D.C.\nCir. 1986) (Parole Commission is not custodian despite its power to release the petitioner).\n  The Assistant Secretary of ICE is not the proper respondent in a habeas petition.  The\nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the warden of a detention facility – the person\nactually holding the petitioner in physical custody – is the proper respondent for a habeas\naction, not the Attorney General.  Blango v. Thornburgh, 942 F.2d 1487, 1491-92 (10th Cir.\n1991).  \"Otherwise, the Attorney General of the United States could be considered the\ncustodian of every alien and prisoner in custody because [he] ultimately controls the [INS]\ndistrict directors and [the] prisons.\"  Yi v. Maugans, 24 F.3d 500, 507 (3d Cir. 1994); see also\nVasquez v. Reno, 233 F.3d 688, 693, 696 (1st Cir. 2000).  The Assistant Secretary of  ICE\nis not the warden of the facilities where the habeas applicants are being held, and, therefore,\nis not the proper respondent for a habeas petition.  The petition should be dismissed for this\nreason alone. \n12\n\nII. THE UNION HAS NO RIGHT TO SUE AS NEXT FRIEND.\nThis Court does not have jurisdiction based on next friend standing because the Union\nhas not verified the petition, applicants can appear on their own behalf, and the Union does\nnot have the requisite significant relationship with applicants.2  Congress codified the next-\nfriend standing doctrine in habeas proceedings in 1948; see 28 U.S.C. § 2242.  \nApplications for writs for habeas corpus must be signed and verified by the person\nseeking relief or the party acting on their behalf.  8 U.S.C § 2242; 28 U.S.C. § 1746 (signed\ndocuments declaring statements to be true under penalty of perjury are sufficient).3  Courts\nhave found that “[a] habeas application must rest on a foundation of factual allegations\npresented under oath, either in a verified petition or supporting affidavits.”  U.S. v. Labonte,\n70 F.3d 1396, 1413 (1st Cir. 1995).  This Court may find that it lacks jurisdiction because the\nUnion’s petition in the present case fails to provide any acceptable form of verification.  See\nHem v. Maurer, 458 F.3d 1185, 1201 n.6 (10th Cir. 2006) (citing Hendricks v. Vasquez, 908\nF.2d 490, 491 (9th Cir. 1990).  Without proper verification, the Court cannot properly weigh\nthe credibility of the Union’s assertions.  Even if the Court allowed petitioner the opportunity\n     2  It appears that the Union does not know who the applicants are, as it identifies the\napplicants by their stolen or fraudulent identities. \n     3  Absent a statutory definition, plain language defines verification as “[a] formal\ndeclaration made in the presence of an authorized officer, such as a notary public, or (in some\njurisdictions) under oath but not in the presence of such an officer, whereby one swears to\nthe truth of the statements in the document.” Black’s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004).”\n13\n\nto remedy this omission, the Court should still find that the Union lacks next friend standing\non two additional grounds.\nThe Supreme Court has established a two-prong test to establish such standing.\nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 163 (1990).  These two requirements are jurisdictional.\nId. at 164; Williams v. Boone, 1999 WL 34856, *5 (10th Cir. 1999) (unpublished) (citations\nomitted) (copy attached per Local Rule 7.1.D.).\nFirst, the next friend must demonstrate that the real party in interest cannot appear on\nhis own behalf, and, therefore, that the real party in interest requires another to litigate the\nmatter.  Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 163.  Detention alone is not enough to establish next friend\nstanding; rather, the next friend must show “inaccessibility, mental incompetence, or other\ndisability.”  Id.; Williams, 1999 WL at *5 (citing Wilson v. Lane, 870 F.2d 1250, 1253 (7th\nCir. 1989) (“A next friend may not file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\ndetainee if the detainee himself could file the petition.”).4\nSecond, the next friend must be truly dedicated to the “best interests of the person on\nwhose behalf he seeks to litigate,” and it has been suggested the next friend must also have\n     4  Some courts have recognized additional situations that meet this prong including the\ninability to understand the English language or situation, Weber v. Garza, 570 F.2d 511, 514\nn.4 (dictum)(citing united States ex. Rel. Bryant v. Houston, 273 F. 915 (2d. Cir. 1921), or\na lack of access to counsel.  See, e.g., Padilla v. Rumsfeld, 352 F.3d 695, 703 (2003), rev’d\nand remanded, 542 U.S. 426 (2004); Coalition of Clergy, Lawyers, and Professors v. Bush,\n310 F.3d 1153, 1160 (9th Cir. 2002).\n14\n\nsome “significant relationship with the real party in interest.”  Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 163.\nCourts have found that this second prong has been met by immediate relatives such as\nparents, see, e.g., Vargas v. Lambert, 159 F.3d 1161, 1163 (9th Cir. 1998); Hamilton v.\nTexas, 485 U.S. 1042, 1042 (1988); Gilmore v. Utah, 429 U.S. 1012, 1013-14 (1976); and\nsisters, see, e.g., United States ex. Rel. Roth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11, 13 n. 3 (1955).  While\nsome courts have recognized that detainees may not have relatives or friends to bring their\nclaims as a next friend, there must still be a showing that a significant relationship exists to\nestablish that the next friend is not an intruder or unintended meddler, styling themselves as\na next friend.  Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 164; see also Coalition of Clergy, Lawyers, and\nProfessors v. Bush, 310 F.3d 1153, 1160, 1162-63 (9th Cir. 2002) (denying next friend\nstanding where the party seeking next friend standing failed to demonstrate any relationship\nwith the detainees, generally or individually); Weber, 570 F.2d at 514 (finding that powers\nof attorney alone without further showing of relationship and interest did not establish next\nfriend standing).\nHere, the Union has not adequately shown next friend standing.  First, the Union has\nnot demonstrated that the individual aliens are unable to appear on their own behalf.  Unlike\nPadilla, where United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed next friend\nstanding for Padilla’s attorney because Padilla was detained incommunicado, Padilla, 352\nF.3d at 703-4, here the Union’s only, and insufficient assertion, is that the Union and Union’s\n15\n\ncounsel were not notified of where individual applicants were incarcerated.  See Petition at\n¶13.  The Union cannot show that individual applicants do not have access to outside\ncommunications.  Indeed, the Union has hired two immigration attorneys to represent\nindividual aliens who are union members in immigration proceedings.  Maldonado Dec. at\n¶ 21.   Moreover, even where the immigration attorneys hired by the union have not made\ncontact with individual detainees, the detainees were advised of their right to seek legal\nadvice within hours of their arrest and were given access to telephones.  Maldonado Dec. at\n¶¶ 6, 13, 17, 20.5  Therefore, where the detainees have the opportunity to access the Union’s\nor their own counsel, this Court should find that the Union does not have next friend standing\nwhere the detainees could file habeas petitions themselves.  See Williams, 1999 WL at *5.\nLastly, the Union has not affirmatively shown that it has a significant relationship with\nor  represents  the  best  interests  of  the  applicant-detainees.  The  Union  has  a  limited\nrelationship to the applicant-detainees akin to the powers of attorney relationship that the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found insufficient to establish standing\nin Weber. 570 F.2d at 514. Here, all the Union claims is an interest in the applicants’\ncontinued employment and conditions of employment, see Petition ¶5, and concern as to the\napplicants’ whereabouts. See Petition ¶13. The fact that the Union seeks to represent\n     5  Unlike the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in criminal cases, 8 C.F.R. § 287.3(c)\nprovides that aliens in immigration detention need only be provided notice of the right to be\nrepresented.  See infra part III(C).\n16\n\napplicants  using  stolen  identities  demonstrates  that  the  Union  knows  little  about  the\napplicants they seek to protect, and further illustrates the lack of a significant relationship.\nAs such the petition should be dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction because the petition is not\nverified, applicants can appear on their own behalf, and the Union does not have the requisite\nsignificant relationship with applicants.\nIII. THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT EXHAUSTED AVAILABLE REMEDIES.\nIn addition, applicants have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.  “[N]o one\nis entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed . . . remedy\nhas been exhausted.”  McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, 193 (1969)).  Although\nexhaustion may not be required in all aspects of habeas review, “[g]enerally, a habeas\npetition cannot be used to substitute for direct appeal.”  Latu v. Ashcroft, 375 F.3d 1012,\n1017 (10th Cir. 2004) (citing United States v. Warner, 23 F.3d 287, 291 (10th Cir. 1994).\nImportantly, where the administrative process can address claims of due process violations,\nexhaustion is required.  See Akinwunmi v. INS, 194 F.3d 1340, 1341 (10th Cir. 1999).  \nThe various violations of due process that the Union believes to have occurred\n(without submitting a single statement from any of the applicants as to what actually\noccurred)  are  all  violations  which  may  be  alleged  and  addressed  in  various  removal\nproceedings, should the individuals wish to make such claims.  Individual aliens may be\nplaced in reinstatement proceedings, see section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality\n17\n\nACT (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), or in removal proceedings, see INA § 240, 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1229a, where they can address their due process claims.  Aliens in proceedings may also\nrequest additional opportunities to retain the counsel of their choice, see INA § 292, 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1362, and aliens may request that an immigration judge review any bond determination,\nsee INA § 242(b)(4)(A), 8 U.S.C. §  1229a(b)(4)(A).  Thus, Congress established an\nadministrative process through which aliens may seek their release from detention.  Because\napplicants have failed to exhaust this process, this Court does not have jurisdiction over their\nclaims.\nIV. APPLICANTS HAVE RECEIVED DUE PROCESS.\nIn any event, the Union fails to allege colorable claims of violations of any of the\napplicants’ constitutional rights.  \nThis case arises from a worksite enforcement operation intended to apprehend illegal\naliens who were unlawfully employed, and who had apparently, for the most part, secured\ntheir employment by stealing the identities of United States citizens and lawful permanent\nresidents.6  DHS had a lawfully issued warrant to enter the Swift compound, see Maldonado\nDecl. at ¶ 2, and ICE agents have the authority to arrest those present in the United States in\nviolation of the immigration laws, see INA § 287(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(1).  Additionally,\n     6  Respondent notes the extraordinary nature of this case -- the use of false identities to\nbring a suit against the government for arresting and detaining individuals using those same\nfalse identities to work illegally in the United States.\n18\n\na determination on whether to grant bond to an illegal alien detained by DHS is in the sole\ndiscretion of the Secretary in the first instance.  See INA § 236(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(2).\nThere is no absolute right to bond, and thus there is no right to be released.  See Reno v.\nFlores, 507 U.S. 292, 306 (1993).\nMoreover, DHS took numerous steps to ensure that the individual applicants had\nknowledge of their right to be represented by counsel and provided numerous opportunities\nfor each individual applicant to call family, friends and/or counsel, even though, as explained\nbelow, applicants possess no constitutional right to counsel.  Accordingly, DHS provided the\napplicants with a full and fair opportunity to obtain counsel.  Thus, the applicants have failed\nto state colorable constitutional claims, and the petition should be denied.\nA. The Arrests Were Lawful.\nICE agents were lawfully present at Swift’s Greeley compound pursuant to a civil\nwarrant issued by United States District Court Judge Phillip Figa.  The use of civil warrants\nto authorize the entry upon premises where illegal aliens are believed to be present and to\npermit their questioning and arrest has longstanding judicial approval.  See Blackie's House\nof Beef, Inc. v.Castillo, 659 F.2d 1211, 1219-27 (D.C. Cir.  1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 940\n(1982).  Further, it is well settled that the INA authorizes ICE agents to question any alien\nor person believed to be an alien regarding immigration status and right to be present in the\nUnited States.  See INA § 287(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(1).  Additionally, INA § 287(a)(2),\n19\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2), authorizes DHS agents to arrest aliens present in the United States\nwithout an arrest warrant, if the officer has reason to believe that the alien is in the United\nStates in violation of the immigration laws and is likely to flee before a warrant can be\nobtained.  Here, ICE not only had reason to believe that the aliens were not legally present\nin the United States, but also that they had obtained employment through the use of stolen\nidentities. \nMoreover, DHS unquestionably followed the regulations detailing how to examine\nsuspected aliens taken into detention without an individual arrest warrant.  See 8 C.F.R.\n§ 287.3; Maldonado Decl. at ¶¶ 6, 13, 17, 20.  ICE examined all individuals who were\ndetermined to be aliens within 20 hours of their apprehension; advised the aliens of their\nright to be represented by counsel on numerous occasions; provided the aliens with a list of\navailable free legal services; and provided telephonic access, if requested, to family, friends,\nor the aliens  counsel of choice.  See Maldonado Decl. at ¶¶ 6, 13, 17, 20.  \nThe applicants have failed to show that the arrests were illegal.  In fact, the petition\ncontains no allegations that the individual applicants, who were working due to their use of\nfalse identities, were not subject to arrest by ICE for violations of the immigration laws.\nIndeed, the government has shown that the arrests were legal.\n20\n\nB. As The Decision On Whether Bond May Be Granted Is Discretionary,\nDHS Has Not Infringed Any “Right” To Bond.\nThere is no presumption that an alien will be released during his removal proceedings.\nReno v. Flores, 507 U.S. at 306 (\"Congress eliminated any presumption of release pending\ndeportation, committing that determination to the discretion of the Attorney General\").\nWhile acknowledging that the Flores Court held that “the Fifth Amendment entitles\naliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings,” the Supreme Court nevertheless\nfound that “detention during deportation proceedings [is] a constitutionally valid aspect of\nthe deportation process.”  Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 523 (2003); Reno v. Flores, 507\nU.S. at 294 (“Congress has given the Attorney General broad discretion to determine\nwhether, and on what terms, an alien arrested on suspicion of being deportable should be\nreleased pending the deportation hearing process.”); Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524, 538\n(1952) (\"Detention is necessarily a part of this deportation procedure.  Otherwise aliens\narrested for deportation would have opportunities to hurt the United States during the\npendency of deportation proceedings\"); Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228, 235\n(1896) (\"We think it clear that detention or temporary confinement, as part of the means\nnecessary to give effect to the provisions for the exclusion or expulsion of aliens, would be\nvalid\"); Carlson, 342 U.S. at 540 (\"The [INA] does not grant bail as a matter of right.\").  See\nINA § 236(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(2).\n21\n\nThe process by which the DHS Secretary and the Attorney General exercise that\ndiscretion is set forth in the regulations and involves multiple administrative components.\nICE makes the initial custody decision in each case – that is, whether to keep the alien in\ndetention pending completion of the removal proceedings, or whether to release the alien on\nbond or other appropriate conditions.  See 8 C.F.R. § 236.1(a).  The alien may appeal this\ndetermination to an immigration judge.  8 C.F.R. § 236.1(d)(1).  That decision may in turn\nbe appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”).  8 C.F.R. § 236.1(d)(3).7  In\ncertain rare cases, the Attorney General himself may be the ultimate adjudicator of the\ncustody decision.  8 C.F.R.§ 3.1(h)(1).  \nIn cases such as these applicants’ cases, where the aliens were initially arrested\nwithout an arrest warrant, a bond determination must normally be made by ICE within 48\nhours.  See 8 C.F.R. § 287.3(d).  In this case, initial bond determinations were made within\nthe first 20 hours, and individual applicants are free to renew any requests for bond in future\nproceedings.  Thus, DHS has infringed on no “right” to bond. \nC. DHS Has Not Infringed Applicants’ Access To Counsel.\nThe applicants, without asserting any facts, claim that they are being denied access\nto counsel.  They are wrong.  \n     7  In certain cases, DHS may appeal an immigration judge's decision to the Board, 8\nC.F.R. § 1003.19(i)(2), and invoke an automatic stay of the immigration judge's order\npending the Board's adjudication of the appeal.\n22\n\nIt is well settled that removal proceedings are purely civil proceedings, and aliens in\ndeportation proceedings are not entitled to the full panoply of rights available to criminal\ndefendants.  See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 486 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984).  Thus, the Sixth\nAmendment right to appointed counsel does not apply to aliens in deportation proceedings.\nSee Michelson v. INS, 897 F.2d 465, 467 (10th Cir. 1990).  An alien merely has the statutory\nprivilege of being represented by counsel of the alien's choice, at no expense to the\nGovernment.  See INA § 240(b)(4)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A); Osei v. INS, 305 F.3d\n1205, 1208 (10th Cir. 2002). \n  The search warrant for a civil administrative search was executed at approximately\n7:30 a.m., Tuesday, December 12, 2006 at the Swift meat plants in Greeley, Colorado.\nMaldonado Decl. at ¶ 2 .  All Swift employees were brought to the plant’s cafeteria by Swift\nmanagement and were interviewed to determine their legal status.  Id. at ¶¶ 4, 9.  Public\ntelephones were available during this time for aliens who wanted to contact counsel, friends,\nfamily, anyone who could bring evidence of lawful status, or anyone else.  Id. at ¶ 6.  \nMoreover, ICE repeatedly informed all aliens of their rights, including their right to\ncounsel.  While applicants were still on the buses that took them to ICE’s processing center,\nICE officers orally advised everyone, in English and Spanish, of the reasons for their arrests\nand their rights, including their right to contact an attorney.  Id.; see also Exhibit 2, Notice\nof Rights and Request for Disposition, Form A-826.  The aliens were then processed at the\n23\n\nprocessing center, which was divided into four stations.  Maldonado Decl. at ¶ 20.  At the\nsecond station, the aliens were again given their rights in writing in Spanish and English, and\ngiven their Miranda rights as well.  Id.  At the fourth station, a Spanish-speaking agent served\nthe Notice to Appear on the aliens, provided the aliens with a list of local legal organizations,\nand once again explained their rights.  Id.\nICE  denied  no  requests  for  attorneys,  and  denied  no  attorneys  access  to  their\nindividual clients.  See id. at ¶ 23.  Requests to use phones at the processing center were met\nwith offers by ICE agents to allow use of their cell phones.  Id.  \nQueries from individuals outside the processing center were complicated by the\nmultiple names used by the aliens.  See id. at ¶ 22.  Unless the person making an inquiry\nregarding one of the detainees used the name the detainee gave to ICE, DHS had no way of\ndetermining initially which of the aliens was the subject of the inquiry.  See id.  Nevertheless,\nDHS advised everyone numerous times of the reasons for their arrests and their right to\ncounsel, and gave the aliens ample opportunities to contact attorneys of their choice.8  See\n     8  Although the Union alleges it represents Union members in employment matters\nrelating to conditions and terms of employment, it makes no showing that it represents\nindividuals  in  civil  immigration  proceedings  or  in  criminal  proceedings.    The  Union\nrepresents its members in negotiations with the employer (in this case, Swift), and not in their\nindividual contacts with the Federal Government.  Additionally, even if the Union could be\nconstrued a representing individual aliens, none of the detained aliens requested Union\nrepresentation.  See NLRB v. Weingarten, 420 U.S. 251, 257 (1975) (“[T]he right [to Union\nrepresentation] arises only in situations where the employee requests representation.”).\n24\n\nid. at ¶¶ 8, 14, 16, 17, 20.  Consequently, the aliens had every opportunity to access counsel,\nin full compliance with the regulations regarding the processing of aliens arrested without\nwarrant.  See 8 C.F.R. § 287.3.  \nD. No Constitutional Right Is Violated By the Detentions At Issue.\nThe Supreme Court decided in the government’s favor the constitutional issues raised\nby the Union.  Specifically, the Court found that no constitutional right is violated when an\nalien is detained for the brief period of his removal proceedings.  See  Demore v. Kim, 538\nU.S. 510, 523, 526 (2003) (noting the Court’s “longstanding view that the Government may\nconstitutionally detain deportable aliens during the limited period necessary for their removal\nproceedings”).  Because the periods of detention at issue here  have been extremely brief –\nfar less than the three to six months in Kim – the applicants’ claims are foreclosed by Kim.\nThe Supreme Court expressly determined that detention during the removal process\nprior to issuance of a final order of removal is not the constitutionally suspect \"indefinite\ndetention\" that was restricted by the Court in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001):\nWhile the period of detention in Zadvydas was “indefinite” and “potentially\npermanent,” the detention here is of a much shorter duration.  Zadvydas\ndistinguished the statutory provision it was there considering from § 1226 on\nthese  very  grounds,  noting  that  “post-removal-period  detention,  unlike\ndetention pending a determination of removability, has no obvious termination\npoint.”\nKim, 538 U.S. at 529.  Whether the applicants' detentions may some day become \"too long\"\nis not an issue before this Court.  Habeas corpus is only a process for testing the current\n25\n\nlegality of a detention.  Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U.S. 335, 336 (1968). \nThe Union has failed to allege even a colorable constitutional claim regarding the\ndetention of the applicants.  \nV. THE  PETITION  FOR  A  WRIT  OF  HABEAS  CORPUS  IS  NOT\nMAINTAINABLE AS A CLASS ACTION\nIt is axiomatic that, for a class action to be certified, a class must exist, and be\nsusceptible to a precise definition.  See A.H. Robins Co., Inc., 880 F.2d 709, 728 (4th Cir.\n1989).  Merely defining the class as “others similarly situated,” as the Union does here,\nwithout providing detailed guidance regarding how the class could be defined and identified,\ndoes not suffice.  See Coleman v. Watt, 40 F.3d 255, 259 (8th Cir. 1994).   In addition to\nfailing to define a class, the habeas petition fails to establish the requirements of Rule 23 of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure – numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy of\nrepresentation, and that the class also satisfies at least one requirement of Rule 23(b).\nMonreal v. Potter, 367 F.3d 1224, 1235 (10th Cir. 2004).  The Union fails to make\nallegations of fact that would satisfy any of the Rule 23 requirements.  Thus, this case cannot\nbe maintained as a class action.  See id.  \n//\n//\n//\n26\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny the Petition for Writ of Habeas\nCorpus.\nDated: December 18, 2006\nRespectfully submitted,\nTROY A.
