    "summary": "<p>This is a summary of the infamous Abner Louima case. a matter that attracted international attention and sparked demonstrations on New York City Hall in 1997 for its allegations of conscious-shocking police abuse. On August 8, 1998, Louima's private attorneys, who included the late Johnnie Cochran, filed suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C.&sect; 1983 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the City of New York, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (PBA) and various individual police officers, alleging police brutality. Louima, a Haitian immigrant, claimed that he was beaten and sodomized with a broken piece of a broomstick or toilet plunger, in a Brooklyn stationhouse bathroom following his arrest at a Haitian nightclub. Louima claimed that the following his torture, officers and the PBA engaged in a widespread conspiracy to cover-up the incident. Louima further alleged that the officer's brutality was the caused by the policies, customs and/or practices of the NYPD and the PBA, including a \"code of silence\" that existed within the department. Louima's wife alleged a claim for loss of consortium.</p>\r\n<p>Five of the individual officers named as defendants in Louima's civil suit were also indicted on federal criminal violations stemming from the attack on Louima. Two separate criminal trials began while Louima's civil case was pending. One defendant officer, Justin Volpe, eventually pled guilty to charges relative to his involvement. Other officers were convicted, but the convictions were overturned on appeal, with charges against one officer being remanded for a new trial. See U.S. v. Schwarz, 283 F.3d 76 (2nd Cir. 2002).</p>\r\n<p>Louima's complaint was amended three times, with the third amended complaint being filed on September 27, 2000. Several individual defendants filed cross-claims, but the legal basis for those cross-claims is unclear from the docket. The PBA responded to the third amended complaint by filing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. PBA argued in part that plaintiffs' third amended complaint did not adequately allege that the PBA acted under color of state law, nor that it conspired with a state actor to deprive plaintiffs' civil rights. Plaintiffs served a memorandum in opposition to PBA's motion to dismiss, addressing the novel issue of the PBA's potential liability in a Section 1983 police brutality case.</p>\r\n<p>In March 2001 Magistrate Cheryl L. Pollak entered a protective order in the case, restricting public access to the proceedings and pleadings. With settlement talks ongoing, Judge Pollak also ordered that all parties to the litigation refrain from publicly disclosing any information regarding settlement negotiations. The protective order was amended several times thereafter and eventually lifted on October 17, 2002.</p>\r\n<p>After years of discovery and protracted settlement negotiations, the case was globally settled for $8.75 million (the City agreeing to pay $7.125 million; the PBA agreeing to pay $1.625 million) in exchange for dismissal of the claims against all of the defendants, except for Officers Charles Schwarz and Francisco Rosario. On July 23, 2001, a stipulation and order of settlement and dismissal was filed. There was a dispute among Louima's attorneys as to the distribution of attorneys' fees, so district court judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. ordered that the amount of the fees be placed in an escrow account, overseen by trustee Ronald L. Garnett, Esq., pending resolution of the fee dispute.</p>\r\n<p>A hearing was held before the court beginning on October 16, 2002, regarding the attorney fee dispute. On October 5, 2004, district court judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. adopted magistrate judge Pollack's report and recommendation on the fee dispute in part and awarded several of the attorneys less than 10% of the total attorneys' fees of $2.9 million. The majority of the fees were ordered payable to attorneys Cochran, Neufeld, Scheck and Rubenstein. Attorney Roper-Simpson appealed the order. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed and the district court thereafter ordered the distribution of the attorney's fees in accordance with its order.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, 2009, the court granted Louima's motion to amend the July 2001 stipulation and order of settlement and dismissal; the modification permitted assignment of future structured settlement to a third-party.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Having heard the testimony of each of the \nstory of police brutality, T&F, \"despite the risks of pursuing  witnesses and carefully considered all of the papers submitted \nsuch spectacular allegations,\" undertook to bring   by the interested parties, this Court  \n  \n1 As a consequence of the untimely and unfortunate death of Mr. Thomas in August 2001, his interest in this matter is being pursued by his \nEstate. (Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Application for Fee Forfeiture and for Recovery of Fees Due \n(\"Estate Mem.\") at 1). Prior to the hearing, an issue arose as to the extent to which conversations with Mr. Thomas could be related by other \nwitnesses in light of the restrictions of the Dead Man's Statute. That was the subject of a separate Order of this Court dated November 14, \n2002, and will not be addressed herein. \n2 At the time the Louima family first contacted Messrs. Thomas and Figeroux, the firm of T&F did not exist. The two lawyers subsequently \njoined as a firm and remained as such until the untimely and unfortunate death of Carl Thomas in August 2001. (Estate Mem. at 1). For \npurposes of this Report, the two attorneys will be referred to as \"T&F\" regardless of whether they had formally joined as a firm at the time. \nSimilarly, Messrs. Cochran, Scheck and Neufeld were not joined as a single firm when they were initially retained by Louima. (See Retainer \nAgreement, dated November 3, 1997, Ex. 2). According to Peter Neufeld, CN&S was formed after the commencement of the Louima \nlitigation so that the lawyers in the firm could focus primarily on civil rights cases, \"where the cases themselves could perhaps be a basis for \nsystematic reform.\" (Transcript of Testimony of Peter Neufeld, October 24, 2002 (\"N.Tr.I\"), at 12). For ease of reference, the three attorneys \nare referred to herein as \"CN&S.\" \n3 CN&S have filed a separate motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C. § 1927 based \non an affidavit filed by Figeroux in connection with the fee proceedings. That motion has not been fully briefed and will not be addressed \nherein. \n4 See discussion infra at 59. \n5 In their original memorandum of law filed prior to the fee hearing, T&F asserted that not only were they entitled to one-third of the total \nattorneys' fees as set forth in the fee sharing agreement with CN&S, but they were seeking an award \"substantially in excess of 50 percent.\" \n(T&F Mem. of Law dated April 18, 2001 at 23-24). However, during the hearing, counsel for T&F indicated that they would not seek more \nthan the one-third provided for in the agreement that was entered into between counsel. (See Transcript of testimony of Sanford Rubenstein \non November 18, 2002 (\"R. Tr.\") at 83). Subsequently, in T&F's post-hearing submissions, T&F reversed position again, arguing that they \nwere entitled to more than 50% of the total attorneys' fees. (T&F Post-Tr. Br. at 74-76). \n6 Since this dispute arises in the context of T&F's right to enforce a charging lien under N.Y. Jud. Law § 475, it is considered an equitable \naction to which no right to a jury trial attaches. See In re Rosenman & Colin, 850 F.2d 57,60 (2d Cir. 1988) (holding \"in the context of both \nattorneys' liens and other liens, such actions have repeatedly been regarded as equitable in nature so that no jury right attaches\" and citing \nDamsky v. Zavatt, 289 F.2d 46, 53 (2d Cir. 1961)); see also In re King, 168 N.Y. 53, 58-59, 60 N.E. 1054, 1056 (1901)(holding that an \nattorney's lien is an equitable remedy); Flores v.

(See Transcript of testimony of \nCasilda Roper-Simpson on November 22, 2002 at 178-84).

However, this testimony \nwas objected to at the hearing, and indeed is inadmissable hearsay. In addition, Louima denied that Dr. Compas played any role in the \ndecision to hire Rubenstein, as did Rubenstein, who denied that he sought out Dr. Compas regarding the case. (L. Tr. at 13; R. Tr. at 34). \nPerhaps the most important testimony in this regard came from Dr. Compas. Dr. Compas denied that Rubenstein ever asked him to get \nRubenstein involved in the case, and Dr. Compas testified that he was not involved in the family's decision to retain Rubenstein. (Compas Tr. \nat 173-74). His testimony is corroborated by Ms. Roper-Simpson's own notes in her personal diary, which state \"'Dr. Compas apparently \ncalled Rubenstein.'\" (R.S. Tr. III at 23; Ex. 84). The testimony relating to the retention of Rubenstein and Rynecki is relevant to Ms. Roper-\nSimpson's allegations that Mr. Rubenstein violated the Disciplinary Rules by the manner in which he became involved in this case. In this \nregard, the Court credits the testimony of Dr. Compas and Mr. Rubenstein and finds no ethical violation in the retention of the Rubenstein \nFirm. See discussion infra at 169-74. \n32 Rubenstein conceded that he was one of the lawyers who favored the addition of the punitive damages amount in the Amended Notice of \nClaim. (R.

Indeed, it is \nunclear whether Scheck was present during Cochran's first, or his second visit to the hospital. Cochran testified that, although he could not \nremember for certain, he thought that Scheck was not present during his first visit. (C. Tr. I at 183). However, Scheck recounted a \nconversation with Louima, involving Louima's concern that the retention of additional attorneys would increase the cost of the total \nattorneys' fees above one third of any eventual recovery (S. Tr. I at 28-29), which Cochran testified occurred during his first visit to the \nhospital. (C. Tr. I at 188-89). Louima also testified to this conversation, but he recalled it taking place during the second meeting at the \nhospital. (L. Tr. I at 21-22). \n37 According to Figeroux and Roper-Simpson, they were both present for the August 23, 1997 meeting but Thomas was not. (F. Tr. III at 17; \nR.S. Tr. I at 66-67). \n38 Roper-Simpson denies that there was any discussion of Cochran's retention by Louima during that first meeting. (R.S. Tr. I at 70). \n  \n\n 2004 U.S. Dist.

Indeed, Neufeld testified that he was out of the country until August 26, 1997, and that he first visited Louima on that date \nafter learning that he, Cochran and Scheck had been retained to represent Louima. (Testimony of Peter Neufeld on October 24, 2002 \"N. Tr. \nI\" at 13-14; Citations to \"N. Tr.

(C. Tr. II at 92). However, \nLouima testified that he told Thomas and Figeroux that he had retained Cochran after the fact. (L. Tr. at 109). Indeed, Roper-Simpson \ntestified that she was not told that Louima intended to hire CN&S until Louima gathered all the attorneys together at the hospital. (R.S. Tr. I \nat 76-78). \n41 Cochran testified that he was not sure if the retainer was typed on August 25, 1997, or signed on that date, or both. (C. Tr. I at 190-91, \n194). \n42 Roper-Simpson testified that this meeting occurred on the same day as the \"lap-top incident,\" see discussion infra at 31, which she testified \ntook place on August 25, 1997. (R.S. Tr. I 76-80; R.S. Tr. II at 197). However, Roper-Simpson also testified that Neufeld attended the \nmeeting at the hospital (R.S. Tr. I at 80), and Neufeld was out of the country until August 26, 1997. (N. Tr.

However, Louima also instructed the attorneys to clear press matters with him. (Id. at 26-27). \n61 T&F argues that Louima's testimony in this regard is \"muddled,\" pointing to Louima's testimony on cross-examination that in January \n1998, he instructed the attorneys not to speak to the press without prior clearance (L.

This article was published approximately \none week prior to that date. (S. Tr. I at 90).

In any event, \nalthough not mentioned by the Court in General Realty, the former client in General Realty had placed the privileged communication at issue \nin her landlord-tenant dispute, thereby waiving the privilege as to that communication. In addition, T&F rely on Stirum v. Whalen, 811 F. \nSupp. 78, 84 (N.D.N.Y. 1993). However, in Stirum the attorneys seeking to disclose client confidences were named defendants in a civil \naction for fraud. Id. \n96 Figeroux contends that, contrary to the claims of CN&S, his repetition of the Giuliani time statement to the press does not warrant his \nforfeiture of fees because Figeroux simply had no reason to believe that Jonas would \"invent a lie\" or that Louima would thereafter ratify the \nstatement to the press. (T&F Post-Tr. Br. at 21). T&F contend that it was Figeroux's trust in Louima and his family, coupled with Louima's \nfailure to tell the truth, that led to the problems faced by Louima later during the criminal trials. (Id. at 21-22). Although the Court finds that \nFigeroux's repetition of the Guiliani time statement to the press without first  \n  \n\n 2004 U.S. Dist.

Not only were T&F's \nstatements to the press anything but restrained, but the suggestion to the press that there were \"ethical\" problems with the way the case was \nbeing handled prejudiced Louima individually, by criticizing not only the attorneys but Louima as well, and raising issues of his credibility \nthat potentially prejudiced him in the criminal proceedings. \n99 Indeed, any diligent investigative reporter could have discovered that Figeroux was the first to repeat the Giuliani time statement publicly \nby doing a simple Lexis-Nexis search. \n100 T&F also point to a purported quote from Rubenstein in a January 28, 1998 Daily News article that the Giuliani time statement was the \nsubject of a federal probe. (Ex. 14). While Rubenstein admitted that he had provided other information to the author of this article, \nRubenstein denies making this statement, stating that the language was a mischaracterization of what he actually said.

While T&F may have reviewed it prior to the filing, neither Thomas or Figeroux signed the Notice of \nClaim, and Rubenstein's testimony suggests that his firm did the bulk of the work associated with the first Notice of Claim. \n108 Roper-Simpson also claimed that she spent an extended amount of time successfully defending more than a hundred persons arrested for \nprotesting on Louima's behalf, which she did without compensation. (R.S. Tr. I at 62-65). However, she failed to present any evidence that \nLouima had authorized her to do such work or more importantly agreed to pay for it.

See, e.g., Sterling v. Miller, 2 A.D.2d 900, 157 N.Y.S.2d 145, 147 (2d Dep't 1956), aff'd,3 N.Y.2d 778, 143 N.E.2d 789, 164 \nN.Y.S.2d 32 (1957).

(Id. at 7–10.) T & F brought Roper–Simpson into \nSimon, Brian D. Waller, for Estate of Carl Thomas and \nthe  case.  Louima  did  not  retain  Roper–Simpson,  but \nThomas & Figeroux. \nrather was told that Roper–Simpson would be “working \nLaw Office of Michael S. Ross, New York, New York,  with [T & F],” and that he understood that “she would be \nfor Cochran Neufeld & Schech, LLP.  paid by T & F.” (Id. at 9.) \n  \nOpinion  On August 15, 1997, Louima retained Sanford Rubenstein \n  (“Rubenstein”)  of  Rubenstein  and  Rynecki  (the \n“Rubenstein firm”) to represent him in the civil matter. \n(Id. at 19.) Lastly, on August 25, 1997, Louima retained \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER  the firm of Cochran Neufeld & Scheck (“CN & S”) “to \ninvestigate and pursue a claim for personal injury and \ncivil rights violations and to represent him in connection \nJOHNSON, Senior J. \nwith  the  state  and  federal  criminal  and  civil  rights \ninvestigations relating to this incident.” (Id. at 25, 27.)

His  interest  in  this    \n  matter is being pursued by his Estate.  Although heatedly contested, on January 23, 1998, T & F \n \nand Roper–Simpson withdrew from further representation \n  of  Louima.  (Id.  at  113–21.)  Following  T  &  F’s \n  withdrawal from the case, the Rubenstein firm and CN & \nS entered into an “Amendment to [the] Agreement By and \nBetween  Counsel,”  in  which  they  agreed  that  (a)  the \n  1 \n \n\nLouima v.

This issue is not before the Court at \n& F is in “recognition of the fact that T & F did perform a \nthis time. \nvaluable service to Louima in the early weeks following   \nthe incident.” (Id . at) \n \n  \nIn their objections, the Estate, T & F, and Roper–Simpson \nIn  determining  the  reasonable  value  of  T  &  F’s  and \ncontend that Magistrate Judge Pollack wrongly found that \nRoper–Simpson’s  services,  the  Court  considered  the \nthe  Rubenstein  firm  and  CN  &  S  had  standing  to \nstanding of the lawyers at the bar, T & F’s contributions \nchallenge  T  &  F’s  right  to  attorneys’  fees  based  on \nto the case, and the work performed by CN & S and \npurported ethical violations.

Magistrate Judge Pollack rejected T & F’s and \nRoper–Simpson requests to share equally in the fees of T \nRoper–Simpson’s  claims  that  they  expended  many \n& F. Roper–Simpson requests one-third (1/3) of the fees \nhundreds of hours on behalf of Louima. Magistrate Judge \ndue to T & F, and if Figeroux is not entitled to any fee \nPollack noted that they failed to submit time records for \naward, she wants one-half of his portion, with the other \nwork allegedly performed on the case. After considering \nhalf going to the Estate of Carl Thomas. Roper–Simpson \nthe  duties  performed  and time  expended  on  the  case, \ncontends that she was not an employee of T & F, but \nMagistrate  Judge  Pollack  found  that  T  &  F  radically \nrather there existed a joint venture between her and T & F \noverstated the value of their contribution to the case. \nto work on the Louima case. \n  \n  \nAfter  comparing  the  amount  and  nature  of  the  work \nRoper–Simpson  also  objects  to  the  manner  in  which \nperformed by T & F and Roper–Simpson with that of the \nMagistrate Judge Pollack calculated the award of fees. \nother lawyers, Magistrate Judge Pollack concluded that \nRoper–Simpson asserts that a more reliable indicium of \n“[i]n absence of any fee sharing agreement, and had they \nhow to calculate the fees of the attorneys in the case is the \ncommitted no breaches of their ethical violations, T & F \nsignificance  of  their  contributions.  Roper–Simpson \nand Roper–Simpson’s contributions to the Louimas’ case \ncontends that the most significant events in the case, to \nwould amount to at most 10 percent of the time and \nwit, early press coverage and the early involvement of the \nservices  rendered  in  the  case,  or  $303,  175.01.” \nU.S. Attorney’s Office, were events in which she was \nMagistrate  Judge  Pollack  then  applied  a  30  percent \ninvolved. \nreduction  for  ethical  violations  committed  by  T  &  F, \n  \nwhich resulted in a total fee of $212,222.50. \nThe  Court  rejects  the  Estate’s,  T  &  F’s,  and \n  \nRoper–Simpson’s contention that the Rubenstein firm and \n*4 In determining whether the $212,222.50 figure was an \nCN & S lack standing to challenge their award of fees \nappropriate  portion  of  the  fees  for  T  &  F  and \nbased on purported ethical violations.

(Estate Mem. at \nalleging, inter alia, violations of 42 U .S.C. § 1983 in  1). For purposes of this Report, the two attorneys will \nbe referred to as “T & F” regardless of whether they \nconnection with the brutal attack on Abner Louima that \nhad formally joined as a firm at the time. Similarly, \noccurred on August 9, 1997 and the subsequent alleged \nMessrs. Cochran, Scheck and Neufeld were not joined \ncover-up conspiracy by the defendants. The underlying \nas a single firm when they were initially retained by \naction was settled on July 14, 2001, with the Louimas \nLouima. (See Retainer Agreement, dated November 3, \nreceiving a total amount of $8.75 million in exchange for  1997, Ex. 2). According to Peter Neufeld, CN & S was \ndismissal  of  the  claims  against  all  of  the  defendants  formed  after  the  commencement  of  the  Louima \nexcept  for  Officers  Charles  Schwarz  and  Francisco  litigation so that the lawyers in the firm could focus \nRosario. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, one-third  primarily  on  civil  rights  cases,  “where  the  cases \nof the total settlement amount, representing the amount to  themselves could perhaps be a basis for systematic \nreform.” (Transcript of Testimony of Peter Neufeld, \nbe  allocated  as  attorneys’  fees,  was  deposited  in  an \nOctober 24, 2002 (“N. Tr. I”), at 12). For ease of \nescrow account to be administered by a trustee appointed \nreference, the three attorneys are referred to herein as \nby the Court. \n“CN & S.” \n  \n \nOn March 12, 2001, prior to the consummation of the \n \nsettlement, the current attorneys for plaintiffs, the firm of \nCochran, Neufeld & Scheck (“CN & S”), and the firm of  3  CN & S have filed a separate motion for sanctions \nRubenstein and Rynecki (the “Rubenstein firm”), filed a    pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nmotion to invalidate any claims made by the Louimas’  Procedure and 28 U.S.C. § 1927 based on an affidavit \nfiled  by  Figeroux  in  connection  with  the  fee \nprior counsel, Carl W. Thomas, Esq.,1 Brian Figeroux, \nproceedings. That motion has not been fully briefed and \nEsq., the firm of Thomas & Figeroux (“T & F”),2 and \nwill not be addressed herein. \nCasilda E. Roper–Simpson, Esq., to share in the legal fees \n \narising from the Louimas’ civil action. In their motion, \n \nCN & S contend that T & F should not receive any \nT & F have a vastly different version of events. They \nportion  of  the  legal  fees  in  this  matter  because  they \ncontend that when Louima initially contacted T & F with \nviolated their ethical and fiduciary duties to Louima in \nhis story of police brutality, T & F, “[d]espite the risks of \nthree ways: (1) they withdrew from representing their \npursuing such spectacular allegations,” undertook to bring \nclient without cause; (2) they violated their ethical duty to \nLouima’s  case  to  the  prosecutors  and  the  public  and, \nkeep client information confidential; and (3) by disclosing \nthrough “enormous time, effort, energy and courage[,] ... \nthis  information,  they  violated  Louima’s  express \ntransform[ed] [Louima] from an anonymous immigrant \ninstructions to the detriment of Louima.

Other culpable individuals and entities,\nhowever, have thus far been able to escape accountability for actions that were\nunconstitutional, tortious, and inhumane.\n4.  During the early morning hours of Saturday, August 9, 1997, Abner Louima was\nin the process of leaving the Rendez-Vous nightclub on Flatbush Avenue in\nBrooklyn when he was suddenly knocked to the ground outside the club by one or\nmore police officers, assaulted, handcuffed, and put into a patrol car.  En route to\nthe 70th Precinct, the patrol car stopped twice: the first time Mr. Louima was\nbeaten by defendants Thomas Wiese and Charles Schwarz, the second time, by\ndefendants Justin Volpe, and Thomas Bruder.  At that time, all of these defendants\nwere uniformed, on-duty New York City police officers.  Along with the beatings.\nMr. Louima endured offensive insults directed at his race and his Haitian\nethnicity.\n5.  By the time Mr. Louima arrived at the 70th Precinct his face had already been\nbattered into a swollen, bloody pulp.  Officers pulled down Mr. Louima's pants\nwhile he was standing before the desk officer.  Naked from the-waistxtown-antl-\nhis hands cuffed behind his back, Mr. Louima was then paraded through the\nprecinct and taken into the bathroom.\n6.  In the bathroom, Schwarz helped restrain Mr. Louima while Volpe took a stick\nand shoved it into Mr. Louima's rectum so hard and deep that it ripped through\n\nhis colon, penetrated the barrier separating the colon from the bladder, and\nperforated the bladder.  Defendant Volpe then removed the stick, which was\ncovered with feces and blood, and shoved it into Mr. Louima's mouth, exhorting\nhim to \"eat your shit.\"\n7.  None of the several on-duty police officer defendants who were within earshot of\nMr. Louima's cries of pain took any action to intercede and halt the torture, nor\ndid any of them promptly report to their supervisors or other city or federal\nauthorities what they had seen and heard.\n8.  Defendant Volpe was sufficiently  confident that the officers present would not tell\nthe truth that later in the morning he showed the feces-covered stick to them and\nbragged about the sexual assault.\n9.  Volpe told the one witness whom he could not count upon to remain silent about\nwhat had happened - Mr. Louima himself- that he and his family would be killed\nif any effort was made to tell authorities what had happened.\n10.  After the sexual assault, Mr. Louima was dragged from the bathroom, with his\npants still down and his hands still cuffed behind his back,4o-a-heldmg cell, where\nhe was kept for several hours before being brought to Coney Island Hospital for\nmedical attention.  During that interim period, none of the other officers or\nsupervisory personnel at the precinct who were aware of Mr. Louima's physical\ninjuries took appropriate action to investigate and report the use of excessive force\n\nor to ensure prompt medical attention.\n1 1.  When Hmergcncy Medical Service (EMS) was finally summoned, Mr. Louima\ndefied the death threat that had been communicated to him -  in the midst of a\ncrowded police precinct house by the uniformed New York Police officer who\nhad just sexually assaulted him - and told the medical technicians what had\nhappened.  But this was to no avail.  Instead, the technicians delayed treatment\nand filed a false report, with the specific intent of assisting the police in covering\nup the true cause, nature and extent of Mr. Louima's injuries.\n12.  Throughout his recovery from surgery and treatment in intensive care, from\nadmission on August 9th until false criminal charges were dropped on August 13l\\\nMr. Louima was handcuffed to his hospital bed and guarded as a prisoner.\n13.  The conspiracy to cover up the savage attacks against Abner Louima began as he\nwas being beaten in the patrol car on the way to the 70th precinct and spread\nquickly beyond the four officers to field sergeant Michael Bellomo and other\nofficers back at the precinct.\nr\n14. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (\"PBA\") quickly became involved in the-\nconspiracy to cover-up the officers' abominable conduct.  Consistent with its\n\\\nregular practice in cases of serious and violent criminal conduct by police officers,\nthe PBA and its agents - all police officers themselves - acted affirmatively to\nprevent guilty parties' being brought to justice, a role that included helping the.\n\nundetected and unpunished and honesty is actively  discouraged.fWurfthe\nimposition of punitive damages against all defendants with the exception of the\nCit\\  and of appropriate equitable relief, plaintiffs hope to deter defendants and\nbring an end to this intolerable cycle of violence and silence.\nJURISDICTION\n21.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988; and\nthe First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution and the laws of the State of New York.

Plaintiffs further invoke the\nsupplemental jurisdiction of this Court to adjudicate pendant state law claims\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.\n22.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).\nPARTIES\n23.  Plaintiffs Abner Louima and his wife, Micheline Louima, are residents of the City\nof New York.  Born in Haiti, Mr. Louima is a naturalized United States citizen\nand-acitizen .of the State of New York.\n24.  Defendant, City of New York (City), is a municipal corporation within the State\nof New York and the public employer of the police officers and Emergency\nMedical Services technicians named as defendants in this action.\n25.

Plaintiffs, in furtherance of their state causes of action, filed timely notice of claim\nagainst the City in compliance with General Municipal Law Section 50.\n3 1.  More than 30 days have elapsed since service of said notice, and the City has\nfailed to pay or adjust the claim.\n32.  By stipulation, the City has agreed to dispense with the need to hold a 50-h\nexamination of plaintiffs in advance of commencing this lawsuit.\n33.  This action has been commenced within one year and ninety days after the\nhappening of the events upon which these claims arise.\nFACTUAL AND GENERAL ALLEGATIONS\n34.  During the early morning hours of Saturday August 9, 1997, Abner Louima was\nin the process of leaving the Rendez-Vous nightclub on Flatbush Avenue in\nBrooklyn when he was suddenly, without legal cause, knocked to the ground\noutside the club by one or more police officers.  Mr. Louima had not committed\nany criminal offense.\n3 5.  On the ground, one_or more officers continued to assault him, his hands were\ncuffed behind his back, and he was placed in the rear of a radio motor patrol car.\n36.  While Mr. Louima lay on the ground, his cousin, Jay Nicolas, upset by the\ntreatment Mr. Louima was receiving from police, struck defendant Volpe in the\nback of the head.  Although Mr. Louima did not and could not have thrown that\n12\n\nwere pulled down, leaving him naked from the waist down.  It is believed that\nBlaich completely ignored the obvious injuries and stripping of Mr. Louima and\nthat, later on. Blaich failed to take appropriate action to investigate and report the\nincident.\n41.  In this half-clothed state, Mr. Louima was then paraded through the precinct and\ntaken into the bathroom.\n42.  In the bathroom, Schwarz and Volpe administered summary punishment.\nSchwarz held the handcuffed Mr. Louima while Volpe took a stick and shoved it\ninto Mr. Louima's rectum with sufficient force to tear through his internal organs.\n43.  Volpe then removed the stick, which was covered with feces and blood, and\nshoved it into Mr. Louima's mouth, exhorting him to \"eat your shit.\"  The\ndefendants called him \"nigger\" and peppered their commands with additional\nethnic and racist slurs.\n44.  At some point in the midst of this torture, defendant Schwarz, attempting to\nsilence Mr. Louima's cries of pain, placed his booted foot on Mr. Louima's face.\n45.  During the course of the torture in the station house bathroom, on information and\nbelief, defendant Wiese planted himself outside the bathroom door as a lookout, a\nrole that included his opening the closed bathroom door to see what his colleagues\nwere doing to Mr. Louima.\n46.  Mr. Louima was told that if he told anyone what had been done to him, he and his\n14\n\nfamily would be killed.\n4\".  After the torture, defendant Volpe displayed the stick to other police officers at the\nprecinct and bragged to them about what he had done.\n48.  Mr. Louima was dragged from the bathroom, with his pants still down and his\nhands still cuffed behind his back, to a holding cell.  He was placed in the cell\nwith his hands still cuffed and his pants still down.\n49.  Defendants Rosario, Aleman, and, on information and belief, defendants Daly and\nO'Brien were in the 70lh Precinct at the time these events were occurring, and\nobserved and/or heard portions of what had happened but failed to intercede\nand/or report it to supervisory personnel and later, when questioned by Internal\nAffairs, gave false and misleading statements.\n50.  The force used in the street, in the patrol car, and inside the precinct bathroom was\nunnecessary, unreasonable, and excessive.\n51.  At no time during the events described above did the defendant officers have\nprobable cause for the arrest of Mr. Louima and there was no legal cause or\nexcuse for his seizure.\n52.  Defendant Volpe has pleaded guilty for his role in the beating of Mr. Louima\nwhen defendants Schwarz and Wiese stopped their police cruiser en route to the\n70th Precinct.\n53.  Defendant Volpe has also pleaded guilty for his role in the torture of Mr. Louima\n15\n\nin the bathroom of the 70\"1 Precinct, and defendant Schwarz has been convicted b\\\na federal jury for his role in the conspiracy to deprive Mr. Louima of his civil\nrights -  including the torture in the bathroom.\n54.  Defendants Volpe, Bruder, Schwarz, Wiese, Bellomo,  Blaich, Daly and O'Brien\nand John Doe officers and non-uniformed personnel were aware of the beatings\nand/or torture but failed to report it promptly and failed to protect Mr. Louima\nwhile in custody.\n55.  Under the oath of office and the written rules and regulations promulgated by the\nNYPD, line officers and command personnel have an affirmative duty to intercede\nand prevent crimes and other misconduct committed by officers and to report such\nconduct whenever they become aware of it.\n56.  According to Patrol Guide Interim Order 3, \"[a]ll members of the service have an\nabsolute duty to report. . . serious misconduct of which they become aware.\"\nSpecifically, upon observing or becoming aware of corruption or misconduct or\nan allegation thereof, all police officers must, among other things, promptly\ntelephone Internal Affairs and, within 24 hours, must provide Internal Affairs with\na detailed written report setting forth what they know concerning other officers'\nmisconduct.  The Order, which was originally issued in January 1995, further\nprovides that \"[c]onduct designed to cover up acts of corruption, prevent or\ndiscourage its report or intimidate those who would report it will be charged as an\n16\n\nobstruction of justice or other criminal act.\"\n57.  Defendants Volpe. Schwarz. Wicse and Bruder made no effort to prevent the\nbeating and torture of Mr. Louima and have made ever}' effort - continuing up to\nthe present - to conceal from authorities the truth about what actually occurred.\nSchwarz, Wiese, and Bruder have been convicted on federal obstruction of justice\ncharges, based on their conduct and lies told to thwart a federal grand jury\ninvestigation, as part of their ongoing effort to protect themselves from being held\naccountable for their criminal conduct.\n58.  Defendant Aleman has pleaded guilty to charges of obstructing justice, arising,\ninter alia, from lies he told to law enforcement investigating Mr. Louima's abuse.\nDefendant Rosario, who was Aleman's partner, has been convicted on similar\ncharges.\n59.  Defendant Rosario has admitted under oath that he lied to Internal Affairs and that\nhe was pressured by the PBA and its representatives not to come forward with\ninformation that would incriminate Volpe, Schwarz, Wiese and others.\n60.  Mr. Louima asked John Doe police officers and/or non-uniformed personnel who\nappeared in the cell room for medical help, but received no assistance for a long\ntime.\n61.  Defendants Volpe, Bruder, Schwarz, Wiese, Bellomo, Blaich and John Doe\nofficers and non-uniformed employees knew, or with due diligence should have\n17\n\nindifference, declined to give immediate medical treatment for the acute trauma.\n66.  As a direct and proximate result of Birnbaum and Pagan's deliberate  indifference.\nMr. Louima's physical and psychological pain and suffering were significantly\nexacerbated.\n67.  Mr. Louima was eventually taken by EMS ambulance to Coney Island Hospital.  It\nis believed that John Doe officers who accompanied the ambulance failed to\ncommunicate the true nature and extent of the injuries to hospital personnel,\ncausing Mr. Louima further delay in treatment and additional pain and suffering.\n68.  Throughout his recovery from surgery and treatment in intensive care, from\nadmission on August 9th until false criminal charges were dropped on August 13th,\nMr. Louima was handcuffed to his bed and guarded as a prisoner.\n69.  The conspiracy to cover up the savage attacks against Abner Louima began as he\nwas being beaten in the patrol car on the way to the 70th precinct and spread\n'  quickly beyond the four officers and sergeant Bellomo to the John Doe officers at\nthe precinct who had some awareness of the brutality but failed either to intercede\nor report jt \\\n70.  In the days after the attack - before any effort was made to interview Volpe,\nSchwarz, Wiese, or Binder - scores of telephone calls were exchanged, at all\nhours of the night, among these individuals and between them and Anthony\nAbbate, a former 70th Precinct officer and PBA delegate, who had recently been\n19\n\nthrown off the force for. among other things, lying at a departmental trial that had\nbeen conducted at a time when he was on probation for past acts of physical abuse\n,  oPervilians.\n[_yl\\{  It is believed that defendant PBA quickly became involved in the conspiracy and\nlugh its agents, played a significant role in advancing the cover-up.  When\ndefendant Wiese, himself a PBA representative, and defendants Volpe, Schwarz,\nand Bruder came under suspicion, they met with union representatives who are\nalso police officers.  On information and belief, the union's agents, including\ndefendants Michael Immitt and Williams Woes, conferred with the offending\nofficers and received incriminating admissions of criminal behavior.  Instead of\ncoming forward and promptly reporting this information as they are obligated to\ndo as police officers, the PBA and its police officer agents suppressed it and\ninstead, adopted and orchestrated an affirmative strategy of obstruction and\nfalsification.\n72.  On Wednesday August 13, defendant Wiese, in his capacity as PBA delegate for\nthe 70th Precinct, convened a meeting in the basement of the station house that was\n\\  attended by the four defendants most directly implicated in the physical abuse of\nMr. Louima, along with Michael Immitt, the highest-ranking PBA officer in South\nBrooklyn, and other PBA agents.  On information and belief, the purpose of this\nmeeting was to devise a common story, inconsistent with the truth, about what had\n20\n\nhappened.  On information and belief, the participants also discussed ways to\ndefame and publicly humiliate Mr. Louima, in the hope that he would be deterred\nfrom pressing charges against them and that tne credibility of any testimony he\nultimately did give would be diminished.\n73.  It was these defendants' intention, on information and belief, to devise a version\nof what had happened that would not be disproved if the other officers who had\nbeen in the 70th precinct did not come forward and cooperate with investigating\nauthorities.\n74.  On information and belief, among the subjects discussed at the August 13 meeting\nwas a plan to claim that Mr. Louima had sustained his injures, not as a result of\ndefendants' vicious assault, but rather through consensual homosexual activity.\nPursuant to this plan, defendants launched a sustained campaign to falsely inform\nother officers, the news media, and, ultimately, law enforcement authorities, that\nthe Rendez-Vous nightlclub catered to a homosexual clientele and that Mr.\nLouima's wallet had contained an advertisement for an \"all-male\" revue and to\ninsinuate that hisJjyuriesja!exe.ihexesult  of consensual sexual activities.\n75.  In the ensuing days, defendant Immitt appeared at the morning, afternoon, and\nmidnight roll calls for the 70th precinct, on information and belief, to personally\nurge all officers to maintain silence in the face of investigators' inquiries.\n76.  Immitt and PBA delegate Timothy Lee then undertook to deter individual officers\n21\n\nencourages the \"blue wall\" is the \"48 hour rule\" codified in the Patrol Guide.\nSection  1 18-9.  The section requires that an officer subject to an official\ninvestigation be given two business days' notice before being interrogated.  An\nofficer who is merely a witness to another officer's criminal conduct must be\ngiven four hours before the commencement of questioning.  Although the Patrol\nGuide language is limited to administrative investigations and should in theory\nhave no adverse impact on criminal investigations, it is believed that the custom is\nto apply the rule to criminal investigations, as well.  Hence, as a rule, no police\nofficer suspected of criminal wrongdoing gets questioned by anyone in law\nenforcement for at least two days.\n81.  On information and belief, it is the practice of the City to grant the PBA a\nsubstantial role in deciding which officers are to be treated as \"witnesses\" and\nwhich are to be treated as \"suspects,\" a power that lends itself to serious abuse\nwhen, as here, the PBA is intent on thwarting a criminal investigation.  It is\nbelieved that in this case the PBA denominated as \"suspects\" - not witnesses  -\nmany, if not all, of the officers who were merely present at the 70th precinct.\n82.  In this case, notwithstanding the fact that NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau had\nbeen alerted about the torture by Sunday August 10 and initiated an official\ninvestigation on that date, no officer (witness or suspect) was questioned until\nWednesday August 13. Consistent with the City's practice not to question police\n23\n\nofficer suspects at all, no attempt, was ever made to question Volpe. Wiese, and\nSchwaiv.. and the first effort to make contact with defendant Brudcr was one week\nafter the incident.\nOne consequence of the custom of deliberate delay and avoidance, implemented\nonly for police targets of investigation, is the window of opportunity for the\ndestruction of evidence, the creation of cover stories, and the pressuring of\nwitnesses.  For instance in this case:\na.  The stick used by defendant Volpe was removed from the crime scene;\nb.  It is believed that potentially inculpatory evidence was removed from the\nlockers of defendants; and\nc.  Informal meetings, including the PBA-initiated gathering in the 70th\nPrecinct basement, were convened for the purpose of preventing the truth\nabout the wrongdoing from coming to light.\nd.  Scores of phone calls were made between and among the officers involved\nand the PBA agents, in an effort to assure that if and when the officers\nultimately were .questioned by. investigators, they would give the/same\nexculpatory - and false - version of what had happened.\n84.  The actions of all individual defendants were performed within the scope of their\nemployment and authority, for whose acts the defendants City and PBA are liable\nunder the doctrine of responded  superior.\n24\n\n85.  The actions of the defendant officers and EMS technicians violated Mr. Louima's\nclearly established rights under the First, Fourth. Fifth,  and Fourteenth\nAmendments of the Constitution and were the direct and proximate cause of the\nphysical and  psychological injuries he suffered.\n86.  The actions of all defendants were intentional, malicious, and in bad faith, thus\ngiving rise to punitive damages as to all defendants with the exception of the\nmunicipality.\nDAMAGES\n87.  As a direct and proximate result of the said acts of the defendants, Mr. Louima\nsuffered the following injuries and damages:\na.  Violation of his rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth,  and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution;\nb.  Loss of physical liberty;\nc.  Life threatening physical injuries, pain and suffering, extreme fear,\nemotional trauma, requiring the expenditure of money for treatment\nexpectedJtoiasLlhe. rest of his life;\nd.  Economic damages including loss of income; and\ne.  Humiliation, embarrassment, and injury to reputation.\nThe physical, psychological, and economic consequences of the defendants'\nactions continue to date, and upon information and belief, will continue into the\n25\n\nfuture.\nCAUSES OF ACTION\nCOUNT I\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 CONSPIRACY\n88.  Paragraphs 1- 87 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n89.  Defendants Volpe, Schwarz, Wiese, and Bruder, under color of law, conspired\nwith one another to deprive Mr. Louima of his constitutional rights, including the\nrights: to be free from the intentional use of unreasonable force; to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures; to associate and speak freely; to have access\nto and seek redress in the courts; and to be free from false arrest, false\nimprisonment, and the delay and denial of medical attention.\n90.  It was part of the conspiracy that the defendants Volpe, Schwarz, Wiese, and\nBruder did, among other acts, physically assault Mr. Louima while his hands were\ncuffed behind his back and while he was in police custody\n91.  In furtherance of the conspiracy and in order to cover up the acts of brutality,\ndefendants engaged in.theJbllQwing:.-.-  _\na.  Falsely arresting and imprisoning Mr. Louima;\nb.  Fabricating and contriving criminal charges lodged against Mr. Louima;\nc.  Although they were aware of the brutality, and were required to report it\nimmediately, deliberately suppressing the truth; and\n26\n\nd.  Submitting false police reports, statements, and testimony to support and\ncorroborate the fabricated charges lodged against Mr. Louima to insulate\nVolpe, Schwarz, Wiese, and Bruder from administrative and criminal\nsanctions;\ne.  Lying to authorities concerning the patrol car stops on the way to the\nprecinct;\nf.  Meeting and telephoning one another regularly in the week following their\nactions, in an effort to share information concerning the state of the\ninvestigation and present a united front in the face of any questioning.\nCOUNT II\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 CONSPIRACY\n92.  Paragraphs 1-91 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n93.  The individual defendants did, under color of law, conspire with one another and\nwith the PBA, to deprive Mr. Louima of his constitutional rights, including the\nrights to be free from unreasonable seizure; to associate and speak freely; and to\nhave access to and seek redress #ent4he-ceurtsr-\n94.  In furtherance of this conspiracy to cover up the acts of brutality that occurred in\nthe police car and at the precinct house, defendants engaged in the following:\na.  Jointly devising a false, exculpatory version of the events of August 9th,\nwhich would be told to investigating authorities;\n27\n\nb.  Enlisting the aid of Abbate, a disgraced, former officer (and PBA delegate)\nin orchestrating a cover-up;\nc.  Refusing to come forward with evidence and information that would\nincriminate the individuals involved, in violation of individual defendants'\nsworn duty as police officers;\nd.  Discouraging individual witnesses from speaking truthfully to investigators\nand intimidating and defaming those individuals who did answer\ninvestigators' questions;\ne.  Knowingly giving false statements to departmental investigators, federal\ninvestigators, federal grand juries, and federal courts;\nf.  Circulating false and defamatory information concerning Mr. Louima, in an\neffort to discourage him from telling authorities and courts the truth about\nwhat was done to him and to diminish the credibility of any information\nand testimony he did give.\nCOUNT III\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 -UNREASONABLE AND EXCESSIVE FORCE\n95.  Paragraphs 1-94 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n96.  By their conduct, defendants Volpe, Schwarz, Wiese, and Bruder, under color of\nlaw, deprived Mr. Louima of his constitutional right to be free from excessive and\nunreasonable force.\n28\n\n97.  Mr. Louima claims damages for the injuries set forth above.\nCOUNT IV\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 - FALSE ARREST AND IMPRISONMENT\n98.  Paragraphs 1- 97 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n99.  By their conduct and under color of law, defendants Volpe, Schwarz, Wiese,\nBruder, and Bellomo deprived Mr. Louima of his constitutional right to be free\nfrom false arrest and false imprisonment.\n100.  Mr. Louima claims damages for the injuries set forth above.\nCOUNT V\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 - DELAY AND DENIAL OF MEDICAL TREATMENT\nAND FAILURE TO PROTECT WHILE IN CUSTODY\n101.  Paragraphs 1-100 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n102.  By their conduct and under color of law, defendants Volpe, Schwarz, Wiese,\nBruder, Bellomo,  Blaich, Daly, O'Brien, Pagan, Birnbaum, and John Doe officers\nacted with malicious or at least deliberate indifference in failing to protect Mr.\nLouima from violence while in police custody and in failing to secure the medical\nattention required for his serious injuries, in a manner that deprived him of his\nconstitutional rights and perpetuated and exacerbated his physical and mental pain\nand suffering.\nCOUNT VI\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 - FAILURE TO INTERCEDE\n29\n\n103.  Paragraphs 1-102 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n104.  By their conduct and under color of state law, it is believed defendants Volpe,\nSchwarz, Wiese, Bruder, Bellomo, Blaich, Rosario, Aleman. Daly, O'Brien, and\nJohn Doe officers each had opportunities to intercede on behalf of Mr. Louima to\nprevent the excessive use of force and unreasonable seizure but due to their\nintentional conduct or deliberate indifference declined or refused to do so.\n105.  As a direct and proximate result, Mr. Louima suffered the injuries and damages\ndescribed above.\nCOUNT VII\n42 U.S.C. §1983 - FIRST AND FOURTEENTH  AMENDMENT\nVIOLATIONS\n106.  Paragraphs 1-105 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n107.  By their conduct and under color of law all individual and John Doe officers, and\nthe PBA, acting under color of law, deprived Mr. Louima of his First and\nFourteenth Amendment rights to have access to and seek redress in the courts.\n108.  The defendants engaged in a cover up in order to conceal the wrongful and\nunlawful conduct taken against Mr. Louima.\n109.  The defendants' efforts to conceal the truth continue to the detriment of Mr.\nLouima.\n110.  As a direct and proximate result, Mr. Louima suffered the injuries and damages\ndescribed above.\n30\n\nCOUNT VIII\n42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) CONSPIRACY WITH RACIAL ANIMUS\n111.  Paragraphs 1-110 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n112.  The individual defendants, under color of law, conspired with each other and with\nthe PBA, to undertake a course of conduct to injure, oppress, threaten, and\nintimidate Abner Louima in the free exercise and enjoyment of the rights and\nprivileges and equal protection of the law secured to him by the Constitution..\n113.  The conduct of the defendants was motivated by racial animus and by their desire\nto injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Abner Louima because of his race,\nAfrican-American, and because of his birthplace, Haiti.\n114.  Defendants' racial and ethnic animus was expressed in racially and ethnically\ninsulting remarks directed at Mr. Louima.\n115.  It was part of the conspiracy that defendants Volpe, Schwarz, Wiese, and Bruder\ndid, among other acts, physically assault Mr. Louima while his hands were cuffed\nbehind his back and while he was in police custody.\n116.  In furtherance-!) f the conspiracy^ and to conceal the crimes and misconduct of\nVolpe, Schwarz, Wiese, Bruder and all the other defendants, with the exception of\nthe municipality, engaged in a cover up.\n117.  The PBA, through its agents, was a willful participant in joint action with officers\nacting under color of law.\n31\n\n118.  As a proximate and direct result of defendants' conduct, Mr. Louima suffered the\ninjuries and damages described above.\nCOUNT IX\n42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) CONSPIRACY TO HINDER PROVISION OF EQUAL\nPROTECTION\n119.  Paragraphs 1-118 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n120.  The individual defendants conspired with each other and with the PBA for the\npurpose of hindering and preventing the constituted authorities of the State of\nNew York from securing and providing Mr. Louima equal protection of the laws.\n121.  In furtherance of the conspiracy, and to conceal the crimes and misconduct of\nVolpe, Schwarz, Wiese, and Bruder, all the defendants, with the exception of the\nmunicipality, engaged in a cover up.\n122.  Among the actions taken in furtherance were false statements made to internal\naffairs investigators, a wholesale abdication of officers' legal duty to report\nincriminating evidence to proper authorities - a default encouraged by defendant\nPBA - attempting to intimidate and defame those who did report to Internal\nAffairs; and directly and indirectly discouraging Mr. Louima from testifying.\n123.  As a proximate and direct result of defendants' conduct, Mr. Louima suffered the\ninjuries and damages described above.\nCOUNT X\n42 U.S.C. § 1985(2) CONSPIRACY TO IMPEDE DUE COURSE OF JUSTICE\n32\n\n124.  Paragraphs 1-123 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n125.  Each of the individual defendants conspired, along with the PBA, to impede the\ndue course of Justice in New York State, with the intent of denying Mr. Louima\nthe equal protection of the laws.\n126.  As a proximate and direct result of defendants' conduct, Mr. Louima suffered the\ninjuries and damages described above.\nCOUNT XI\n42 U.S.C. § 1985(2) CONSPIRACY TO OBSTRUCT FEDERAL JUSTICE\n127.  Paragraphs 1-126 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n128.  The individual defendants conspired with one another and with the PBA to\nobstruct the investigation of a federal grand jury and to deter witnesses from\ngiving testimony in a federal proceeding.\n129.  Defendants Schwarz, Wiese, Bruder and Rosario stand convicted of having\nobstructed justice, and defendants Aleman and Volpe have pleaded guilty to that\ncharge.\n130.  On information and-belief, defendant-Tmrnkt-encouraged all police officer\nwitnesses to maintain silence if approached by State or federal investigators.\n131.  On information and belief, PBA agents, including defendants Michael Immit and\nTimothy Lee, sought to deter and intimidate witnesses who might give truthful\ntestimony that would inculpate the individual police officer defendants and to tip\n33\n\noff targets and help them modify their false, exculpatory stories when these efforts\nto discourage truthful testimony did not completely succeed.\n132.  On information and belief, the PBA, though its agents, continues to deter and\ndiscourage police officer witnesses from testifying truthfully  in federal court\nabout, among other things, the substance of the discussion in the basement and\nabout the role of defendant Schwarz - whose guilt beyond a reasonable doubt has\nbeen found by two federal criminal juries.\n133.  Defendants waged a sustained, extralegal campaign to cause Mr. Louima\nemotional distress so that he would be deterred from testifying truthfully in this\nand other federal proceedings.\n134.  As a proximate and direct result of defendants' conduct, Mr. Louima suffered the\ninjuries and damages described above.\nCOUNT XII\n42 U.S.C. § 1986 ACTION FOR NEGLECT TO PREVENT\n135.  Paragraphs 1-134 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n136.  On information and belief; the-indivkhtai named defendants, John Doe\ndefendants, William Woe defendants, and the PBA had knowledge that a 42\nU.S.C. § 1985(3) conspiracy was in progress, had the power to prevent or aid in\npreventing the conspiracy from continuing, and neglected or refused to do so.\n137.  With reasonable diligence, defendants could have promptly reported the brutality\n34\n\nto superiors and to duly authorized investigators.  Their failure contributed to Mr.\nLouima's suffering gratuitously before medical care was obtained for him and for\nhis remaining under arrest, guarded, and handcuffed throughout the first four days\nof surgery, intensive care and hospitalization, thereby exacerbating his pain and\nsuffering.\n138.  Had the individual defendants and PBA agents complied with the law and\nfurnished truthful information to authorities investigating the brutality in the\npolice car and the precinct house, the § 1985(3) conspiracy would not have\nsucceeded to the extent that it did and continues to.\n139.  As a proximate and direct result of defendants' conduct, Mr. Louima suffered the\ninjuries and damages described above.\nCOUNT XIII\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 SUPERVISORY LIABILITY\n140.  Paragraphs 1-139 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n141.  Defendants Bellomo and Richard Roes were, at the relevant times, supervisory\npersonnel at the 7Qth^reeinct or in the-N¥PBrwith oversight responsibility for\nline officers Volpe, Schwarz, Wiese, Bruder, and Bellomo.  They were\nresponsible for the training, instruction, supervision, and discipline of the four\nofficers who brutalized Mr. Louima and for Sergeant Bellomo, an accessory after\nthe fact.\n35\n\n142.  h is believed that these defendants received complaints about the conduct of\nVolpe. Schwarz, Wiese, Bruder, Bellomo, and other officers in the 70th precinct,\nknew about past complaints, aberrant behavior, and disciplinary infractions, or, in\nthe exercise of due diligence, would have perceived that these officers had\nconduct and disciplinary problems that posed a pervasive and unreasonable risk of\nharm to Mr. Louima.\n143.  These defendants knew, or in the exercise of due diligence would have known,\nthat the conduct of Volpe, Schwarz, Wiese, Bruder, and Bellomo against Mr.\nLouima was likely to occur.\n144.  It is believed that these defendants failed to take preventative and remedial\nmeasures to guard against the brutality and cover up committed by Volpe,\nSchwarz, Wiese, Bruder, and Bellomo.  Had they taken appropriate action, Mr.\nLouima would not have been injured.\n145.  For example, the Police Department received a number of complaints concerning\ndefendant Volpe's excessive use of force on civilians.  Although the Police\nDepartment investigators-pronounced aH-ofthese unfounded, an independent\nreview of the cases, conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in conjunction with\nits criminal proceeding against these defendants, found more than one of them to\nhave merit.\n146.  The Police Department also failed to take any corrective or disciplinary action\n36\n\nagainst defendant Schwarz, who had testified untruthfully  at a departmental\nhearing in an unsuccessful attempt to help defendant Abbate - himself the object\nof more than two dozen civilian complaints - remain on the force.\n147.  The failure of these individual defendants to supervise and discipline Volpe,\nSchwarz, Wiese, Bruder, Bellomo and the other officers of the 70th precinct\namounted to gross negligence, deliberate indifference, or intentional misconduct\nwhich directly caused the deprivations suffered by Mr. Louima.\nCOUNT XIV\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 -  SYSTEMIC CLAIM AGAINST CITY AND PBA\n148.  Paragraphs 1-147 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n149.  Prior to August 9, 1997, the City, acting at the behest of and in close conjunction\nwith the PBA, has developed andjnaintained policies and customs exhibiting\ndeliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of its citizens, which caused the\nviolations of Mr. Louima's rights.\n150.  It was the policy and/or custom of the City to investigate inadequately and\nimproperly civiliaR-compteiftts of poliee-miseonduct and to punish inadequately\nthose complaints which were substantiated.  Instead, acts of brutality were\ntolerated by the City.  The Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) and the Civilian\nComplaint Review Board (CCRB) have substantially failed in their\nresponsibilities to investigate misconduct and discipline transgressors.  Since the'\n37\n\nCCRB became independent in 1993, through December 1996 it received  18,336\ncomplaints, yet the NYPD dismissed only one officer as a result of a CCRB\ninvestigation.\n151.  IAB investigations of brutality rarely lead to administrative trials and, in the rare\ninstances that charges are sustained administratively, the punishment is minimal,\nlacking any deterrent effect. Since there is no disciplinary sanction available\nbetween thirty days' suspension and dismissal, and dismissal is almost always\ndeemed too harsh, even the most brazen acts of brutality, short of. murder, are\nresolved with a slap on the wrist.\n152.  The City has been on notice for more than a generation that brutality is\nwidespread and that particular reforms need to be implemented.  From reform-\nminded Commissioner Patrick Murphy to the Mollen Commission twenty-five\nyears later, the City has been repeatedly cautioned that a systemic tolerance for\nbrutality flourishes throughout the NYPD.  Three years before Mr. Louima was\nbrutalized, the Mollen Commission report noted, \"This tolerance,, or willful\nblindness, extends -to-supervisors-as-weti-.-This-is because many supervisors share\nthe perception that nothing is really wrong with a bit of unnecessary force and\nbecause they believe that this is the only way to fight crime today.\"  \"Such\npractices,\" the Commission warned, \"should sound an alarm throughout the\n[Police] Department.\"  1\n38\n\ninvestigations, it is the City's custom to follow the rule in criminal investigations,\nas well.  Moreover, while the 48-hour delay is expressly limited to targets - with\nmere witnesses accorded a four-hour grace period - the custom, is to allow the\nPBA and its representatives considerable input  in deciding who is a target and\nwho is a witness.\n157.  As a matter of practice, the City often takes more than 48 hours to interview\nofficers suspected of or believed to have witnessed excessive force or other\nserious criminal conduct.  As was the case here, the first witness to be questioned\npursuant to the Patrol Guide was on August 13, four days after the events had\ntranspired and three days after the IAB was aware of the torture and after the\nconspiracy to obstruct justice had gathered full steam.\n158.  Moreover, even when police officers are interviewed under the Patrol Guide, they\nare not giving sworn testimony, and they are granted complete immunity  -\nincluding for perjury.\n159.  With respect to those police officers who are suspects in - and not merely\nwitnesses to ~ serious misconduct: it is the-Gity^s practice never to question them,\nan approach that differs drastically from that employed when the police\ninvestigate crimes where the suspects are civilians (or are City employees other\nthan police officers).  In cases where the police are trying to bring a civilian\nsuspect to justice, it is common to make prompt contact with the individual and to\n40\n\nsee what information about the crime he or she will volunteer.  In this case, no\nsuch effort was ever made to question Volpe, Schwarz, or Wiese, and the first\ntime Bruder was interviewed was a week after the beating and torture.\n160.  These policies operate to insulate police officers who engage in criminal or other\nserious official misconduct from detection, prosecution, and punishment, and are\nmaintained with deliberate indifference to that obvious and widely known effect.\n161.  Police officers of the City of New York have for years engaged in a pattern and\npractice of actively and passively covering up the misconduct of fellow officers by\nfailing to come forward or failing to accurately give evidence as to misconduct of\nwhich they are aware, thereby establishing and perpetuating a \"code of silence*\"-\n162.  This \"code of silence\" is a custom so deeply ingrained in the New York City\nPolice Department so as to constitute the policy of the City of New York.\n163.  The City has been deliberately indifferent to the need for more or different\ntraining, rules and regulations relating to police officers who witness or have\ninformation regarding misconduct by fellow officers.  The City has failed to\nproperly sanction-or disdplioe-Gfikers-who-^iFe-aware of and subsequently\nconceal and/or aid and abet violations of constitutional rights of citizens by other\nNew York City police officers, thereby causing and encouraging New York City\npolice officers, including the individual defendant officers in this case, to violate\nthe rights of citizens such as Mr. Louima.\n41\n\n164.  Once again, the City was on notice about this problem for decades, and it had\nbeen an important area of focus for the Mollen Commission, which specifically\nfound that the tactics of the PBA and other unions \"put[] immense pressure on the\nguiltless officer - who may want to answer questions - not to stray from the\ncommon practice of abiding by union advice and remaining silent\"; that \"PBA\ndelegates and attorneys help reinforce the code of silence,\" and that \"the PBA\noften acts as a shelter and protector of the corrupt cop, rather than as a guardian of\nthe interests of the vast majority of its membership, who are honest police\nofficers.\"-\n165.  ft is believed the City has maintained no system or an inadequate system of review\nof officers who withhold knowledge or give false information regarding\nmisconduct by fellow officers.  This failure to identify and track such officers,\nlrtciudhig the defendant officers, or to discipline, more closely supervise, or retrain\nsuch officers who engage in the \"code of silence,\" causes New York City police\nofficers to believe that they can engage in misconduct, secure in the knowledge\nthat their fellow offlcer^willa^dth^r-intervefl&Ror-give-evidence  against them.\nThese systemic deficiencies include, but are not limited to:\na.  Preparation of investigative reports designed to vindicate the conduct of\nofficers who gave false information about the misconduct of other officers,\nor who falsely denied knowledge about misconduct which they were in a\n42\n\nposition to observe;\nb.  Preparation of investigative reports which uncritically rely solely on the\nword of police officers and which systematically fail to credit testimony of\nnon-police witnesses.\nc.  Preparation of investigative reports which omit or ignore factual\ninformation and physical evidence which contradict the accounts of police\nofficers;\nd.  Issuance of public statements exonerating officers involved in such\nincidents prior to the completion of investigation;\ne.  Failure to have meaningful review of investigative reports by responsible\nsuperior officers for accuracy or completeness, including consideration of\nthe conduct of officers who were not actively engaged in the misconduct\nwhich was the subject of the investigation, and acceptance of conclusions\nwhich are not supported by the evidence or which contradict such\nevidence; and\nf.  Failure to identic-potential \"code-of silenee\" violations and maintain\naccurate records of allegations of such misconduct.\n166.  The City, prior to and at the time of this incident, was aware of the need for more\nor different training, rules, regulations, investigation and discipline relating to\npolice officers who practice the \"code of silence,\" and was deliberately  indifferent\n43\n\nto that need.\n167.  The foregoing acts, omissions, systemic deficiencies and deliberate indifference to\nthe danger of harm to citizens such as plaintiff and the need for more or different\ntraining and discipline are policies, practices and customs of the City of New York\nand have caused police officers, including the officer defendants in this case, to\nbelieve that they can violate the rights of citizens with impunity, and that their\nfellow officers would conceal such conduct, including swearing falsely and\ncommitting perjury, all with the foreseeable result that officers will violate the\nconstitutional rights of citizens.\n168.  The culture of silence and dishonesty concerning police misconduct exists because\nof, rather than despite, the efforts of the PBA.\n169.  As the Mollen Commission found, the PBA's policies put \"immense pressure\" on\nhonest officers to maintain silence - to the detriment of law enforcement and\npolice-community relations - and often contrary to these individuals' own interest\nand \"fuel the insularity that characterizes police culture.\" The Commission\naccused PBA delegates of trying-to thwart law enforcement efforts to eradicate\nwidespread police corruption.\n170.  The role the PBA and its agents played in this case was not an aberration.  Rather,\nit has been standard operating procedure to abet and orchestrate the obstruction of\njustice in even the most notorious instances of police misconduct.\n44\n\n171.  For example, in the case of Anthony Baez, an unarmed civilian choked by a police\nofficer, agents of the PBA played a prominent role in helping the officers involved\nto concoct false, albeit consistent, stories and in pressuring the police officer who\nultimately exposed their lies not to come forward - and to expose her to severe\nretaliation.\n172.  In addition to their role in manipulating the 48-hour rule, PBA agents make\nimproper use of the attorney-client privilege and the spurious delegate-member\nprivilege to orchestrate cover-ups among co-conspirators and to identify and\nsilence police witnesses who would otherwise give honest testimony.\n173.  It is the custom and practice of the PBA to treat those officers who want to come\nforward -  and not those who violently abuse citizens - as wrongdoers.\n174.  As a direct and proximate result of the City's and the PBA's policies and their\ndeliberate indifference, defendants violated Mr. Louima's constitutional rights for\nwhich he suffered substantial damages.\nCOUNT XV\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 GONSPIRA€¥^8ETWEEN-GITY AND PBA\n175/  Paragraphs 1-174 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n/\n176.  Acting jointly over a period of many years, the City and PBA together established\n\\  policies and customs which allow even the most brazenly brutal officers to believe\nthat they can use excessive force with impunity.\n45\n\n177.  This conspiracy between the City and the PBA is ultimately responsible for, and\nthe proximate and direct cause of the violation of Abner Louima's rights and the\nextraordinary injuries that ensued.  /\nNT XVI\nPENDENT CLAIM OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND NEGLIGENCE\n178.  Paragraphs 1-177  are incorporated by reference as fully set forth.\n179.  Defendants the PBA, Matarazzo, Lynch, Immit and unknown William Woe agents\nof the PBA have been grossly negligent and negligent in the supervision, training,\nand monitoring of their representatives who consult with and counsel police\nofficers who are suspected of crimes and misconduct, and police officers who are\nwitnesses to crimes and misconduct by their fellow officers.\n180.  By virtue of the unique public safety considerations implicated by police violence,\nits pivotal role in the official investigation of police misconduct, and its express\nundertakings in its collective bargaining agreement with the City, the PBA and the\nindividual PBA defendants have a duty to make sure their members and their\nagents, who are also police officers, do not Aoalate-their 4uties as police officers to\nreport crimes and misconduct by fellow officers.\n181.  The PBA and the individual PBA defendants have been grossly negligent and\n!\ni\n\\  negligent in the instruction and training they provide to their members with  \" /\nrespect to their responsibilities to report crimes or misconduct by other police!\n46\n\nofficers.\n182.  The PBA and the individual PBA defendants have been on notice for man}' years\nthat their representatives have played a role in the improper obstruction of\ncriminal investigations of New York City police officers.\n183.  The PBA and the individual PBA defendants knew or should have known that\ntheir policies and practices have contributed to improper concealment of\nadmissions by police officers to PBA representatives, and a \"code of silence\"\nbeing followed by police officers, who are also PBA members, to cover up crimes\nand misconduct.\n184.  The PBA and the individual PBA defendants knew or should have known that\ntheir policies and practices, as well as their grossly negligent and negligent\nsupervision and training of PBA representatives, created an atmosphere where the\nmost violent police officers felt assured that their most brazen acts of misconduct\nwould not be swiftly and effectively investigated and prosecuted.\n185.  The mistreatment and torture of Mr. Louima previously set forth, and the\nsubsequent cover up of those events, were reasonably foreseeable results of the\nPBA's and the individual PBA defendants' negligent conduct.\nCOUNT XVII\nPENDENT CLAIM OF ASSAULT AND BATTERY\n186.  Paragraphs 1-185 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n47\n\n187.  By their actions, as set forth above, defendants Volpe, Schwarz, Bruder, and\nWiese committed atrocious acts of battery against Abner Louima which included\nbeating and kicking him about the face and body without cause, threatening to kill\nhim and his entire family, and sodomizing him with a stick at the 70lh precinct.\nThis use of physical force against Mr. Louima was unnecessary and excessive.\n188.  The City is responsible for the threats and the excessive and unnecessary physical\nforce used by defendants Volpe, Schwarz, Bruder, and Wiese because the\nmisconduct occurred while they were acting in the scope of their employment,\nspecifically in the course of arresting Mr. Louima, and while they were executing\ntheir responsibility to hold him safely in police custody at the 70th precinct.\n189.  As a result of these death threats and the excessive and unnecessary physical force\nused against him, Mr. Louima suffered severe and serious physical and mental\ninjuries.\nCOUNT XVIII\nPENDANT CLAIMS OF FALSE ARREST AND FALSE IMPRISONMENT\n190.  Paragraphs 1-189 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n191.  Abner Louima was wrongfully, unlawfully, and unjustifiably  charged, arrested,\ndetained and deprived of his liberty against his will, and was imprisoned by\ndefendants Volpe, Bruder, Schwarz, Wiese, Bellomo, other unknown John Doe\npolice officers and unknown Richard Roe supervisory personnel.\n48\n\n\n\n192.  At all relevant times, these defendants acted forcibly in apprehending Mr. Louima.\n193.  The wrongful, unjustifiable, and unlawful apprehension, arrest, detention and\nimprisonment was carried out without a warrant.\n194.  After his arrest, Mr. Louima was wrongfully harassed, threatened, and subjected\nto the taking of mug shots in a particularly humiliating fashion and fingerprinting.\n195.  Throughout Mr. Louima's false arrest and imprisonment, defendants Volpe,\nBruder, Schwarz, Wiese, Bellomo, other unknown John Doe police officers, and\nunknown Richard Roe supervisors did not permit him an opportunity to establish\nhis innocence.\n196.  At all times mentioned, the unlawful, wrongful, and false arrest and imprisonment\nof Mr. Louima was without right or probable cause, and was forcible and against\nhis will.\n197.  All of the foregoing occurred without any fault or provocation on the part of Mr.\nLouima.\n198.  At all relevant times defendants Volpe, Bruder, Schwarz, Wiese, Bellomo, other\nunknown John Doe police officers and unknown Richard Roe supervisors who\nwere responsible for the false arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Louima were\nemployees of the NYPD and the City, and were acting for, upon and in\nfurtherance of the business of their employers and within the scope of their\nemployment.\n49\n\n199.  As a result of the false arrest and imprisonment, Mr. Louima was subjected to\nhumiliation, ridicule, and disgrace.  He was required to incur bills for legal\nservices rendered, and was otherwise injured and damaged.\nCOUNT XIX\nPENDENT CLAIMS OF INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF\nEMOTIONAL DISTRESS\n200.  Paragraphs 1- 200 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n201.  In the course of battering Mr. Louima about the face and body, sodomizing him\nwith a stick, and falsely arresting and imprisoning him, defendants Volpe, Bruder,\nSchwarz, Wiese, Bellomo, Blaich and John Doe Police Officers embarked on a\nmalicious, willful, and grossly negligent course of conduct intended to cause Mr.\nLouima to suffer extreme mental and emotional distress, agony, and anxiety.\n202.  One objective of this extreme and outrageous course of conduct was to inflict\nsevere mental and emotional distress upon Mr. Louima so as to intimidate, terrify,\nand dissuade him from exposing the vicious assault and torture inflicted upon him,\nthe false arrest and imprisonment, and the unconscionable delay and denial of\nmedical treatment Mr. Louima endured.\n203.  Volpe directly threatened to kill Mr. Louima and his entire family if Mr. Louima\nrevealed the horrible punishment visited upon him during the course of his false\narrest and incarceration at the 70th precinct; Bruder, Schwarz, Wiese, Bellomo,\nBlaich, and John Doe Police Officers either knew or should have known about\n50\n\nthese outrageous acts of terror and duress and attempted to stop them or\nameliorate their effects upon Mr. Louima.\n204.  Volpe. Bruder, Schwarz, Wiese, Bellomo, Daly, O'Brien, Blaich and other\nunknown John Doe police officers either knew or should have known that Mr.\nLouima had been severely injured, that failure to get him to a hospital for\nimmediate treatment would create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm, and that\nfailure to obtain such treatment promptly would cause Mr. Louima extreme mental\npain and anguish; nonetheless, all of these defendants breached their duty to\nobtain medical treatment for Mr. Louima.\n205.  Defendants Rosario, Aleman, Blaich, Daly, O'Brien, and other John Doe\nunknown police officers, defendants PBA, Immitt, Lee, and other William Woe\nunknown agents for the PBA, intentionally, recklessly or negligently caused Mr.\nLouima to suffer mental and emotional distress by impeding and obstructing the\nexposure of the vicious battering and torture he suffered, the false arrest and\nimprisonment he endured, and the wanton delay and denial of  medical treatment\nhe experienced.  •- • --\n206.  It is believed that Volpe, Bruder, Schwarz, Wiese, the PBA and unknown John\nDoe police officers and William Woe agents for the PBA pursued a malicious\ncampaign to inflict mental and emotional distress upon Mr. Louima by spreading\nfalse suggestions in the community and press that Mr. Louima had suffered\n51\n\ninjuries to his colon and rectum as a result of homosexual activity at the Club\nRendez-Vous.  These false suggestions, as these defendants knew or should have\nknown, caused Mr. Louima humiliation and ridicule.\n207.  The aforesaid acts of intentional, reckless and negligent infliction of emotional\nand mental distress by defendants constitute misconduct of an egregious nature\nthat exceeds all bounds usually tolerated by a civilized society.\nCOUNT XX\nPENDENT CLAIMS OF NEGLIGENCE FOR FAILING TO CARE,\nPROTECT, AND OBTAIN MEDICAL TREATMENT\n208.  Paragraphs 1- 207 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n209.  As New York City police officers, Volpe, Bruder, Schwarz, Wiese, Bellomo,\nBlaich and other unknown John Doe police officers had a duty to care, protect,\nand obtain medical treatment for Mr. Louima while he was being held as a\nprisoner at the 70th Precinct.\n210.  These defendants knew or should have known about the severe injuries Mr.\nLouima had suffered and were negligent in their failure to protect him from\nfurther injury at the precinct and their failure to prevent an unconscionable and\nunnecessary denial and delay in medical treatment and transport to a hospital.\nCOUNT XXI\nPENDENT CLAIM OF PRIMA FACIE TORT\n211.  Paragraphs 1 - 210 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n52\n\n212.  By their actions, as set forth above, defendants Volpe, Bruder. Schwarz. Wiese.\nBellomo, Blaich, Daly, O'Brien, and other unknown John Doe police officers\ninflicted harm upon Mr. Louima, without excuse or justification, out of\ndisinterested malevolence.\nCOUNT XXII\nPENDENT CLAIMS OF MAKING AN INJURIOUS FALSE OR\nFRAUDULENT STATEMENTS\n213.  Paragraphs 1 - 212 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n214.  William Pagan and Frank Bimbaum, as employees of Emergency Medical Service\nwho responded to the 70th Precinct on August 9, 1997 to treat Mr. Louima and\ntransport him to a hospital, had an obligation to accurately and reliably report\ninformation that would be relevant to Mr. Louima's care and treatment.\n215.  Nevertheless, Pagan and Bimbaum intentionally omitted in their Ambulance Call\nReport Mr. Louima's statements to them that he had been beaten by police\nofficers, and had a stick shoved into his rear end and instead falsely stated that Mr.\nLouima had told them he had been punched, kicked, and hit, without any\nreference to the police or to the acute trauma to his rectum and internal organs.\n216.  The false information provided by Pagan and Bimbaum in their Ambulance Call\nReport and at other times before, during, and after Mr. Louima was transported to\nConey Island Hospital, damaged Mr. Louima by delaying and denying him\nmedical treatment and by causing him fear, pain and anguish.\n53\n\nCOUNT XXIII\nPENDENT CLAIMS OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND NEGLIGENCE\nAND INTENTIONAL AND NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL\nDISTRESS\n217.  Paragraphs 1- 216 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n218.  Pagan and Birnbaum, as EMS employees, were grossly negligent and negligent in\nthat they had a duty to care for Mr. Louima which they violated by delaying and\ndenying him prompt treatment and transport to the hospital, by providing false\ninformation about the source, nature, and extent of his injuries, and by failing to\ntake steps that an ordinarily reasonable and prudent person would have pursued to\ncare and protect Mr. Louima.\n219.  Pagan and Birnbaum knew or should have known that their denial and delay of\ntreatment and transport of Mr. Louima created an unreasonable risk of bodily\nharm and did cause Mr. Louima mental distress and anguish.\nCOUNT XXIV\nPENDENT CLAIM - RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR\n220.  Paragraphs 1- 219 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n221.  At all relevant times, all defendant employees of the City of New York were\nacting for, upon, and in furtherance of the business of their employer and within\nthe scope of their employment.\n222.  Consequently, the City is liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for their\n54\n\ntortious actions.\nCOUNT XXV\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 AND PENDENT CLAIM BY MICHELINE  LOUIMA\n223.  Paragraphs 1- 222 are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.\n224.  At all times relevant to this action, Micheline Louima was and is the lawful spouse\nof Abner Louima and, as such, was and is entitled to the comfort, enjoyment,\nsociety and services of her spouse.  By reason of the foregoing conduct by\ndefendants, Micheline Louima was deprived of the comfort and enjoyment of the\nservices and society of her spouse, which are guaranteed to plaintiff under the\nlaws and constitution of the State of New York and can be adjudicated in this\nlitigation under the Court's supplementary jurisdiction.  Moreover, defendants'\nconduct undermined Micheline Louima's liberty interest in preserving the\nintegrity and stability of the marital relationship from intervention by the state\nwithout due process of law.\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs request the following relief jointly and severally as\nagainst all of the defendants:\n1.

After considering  involved. \nthe  duties  performed  and  time  expended  on  the  case,    \nMagistrate  Judge  Pollack  found  that  T  &  F  radically  The  Court  rejects  the  Estate’s,  T  &  F’s,  and \noverstated the value of their contribution to the case.

The Court agrees \nperformed by T & F and Roper–Simpson with that of the  with Magistrate Judge Pollack that “CN & S and the \nother lawyers, Magistrate Judge Pollack concluded that  Rubenstein firm stand in the shoes of the Louimas in \n“[i]n absence of any fee sharing agreement, and had they  asserting  that  T  &  F’s  violations  of  their  ethical \ncommitted no breaches of their ethical violations, T & F  obligations to their clients were sufficiently egregious to \nand Roper–Simpson’s contributions to the Louimas’ case  warrant forfeiture of T & F’s right to a share of the fees.” \nwould amount to at most 10 percent of the time and  (Id. at 123.) Although there is no case directly on point, \nservices  rendered  in  the  case,  or  $303,  175.01.”  the Court further agrees with Magistrate Judge Pollack \nMagistrate  Judge  Pollack  then  applied  a  30  percent  that “[t]o hold otherwise would mean that an attorney \nreduction  for  ethical  violations  committed  by  T  &  F,  who  agrees  to  split  a  contingency  fee  with  another \nwhich resulted in a total fee of $212,222.50.  attorney could blatantly commit untold breaches of the \n   ethical rules to the detriment of the client or withdraw \n*4 In determining whether the $212,222.50 figure was an  without cause and rest on his laurels while the remaining \nappropriate  portion  of  the  fees  for  T  &  F  and  attorney labors successfully on behalf of the client.” (Id.) \nRoper–Simpson, Magistrate Judge Pollack next estimated  After carefully considering the Estate’s, T & F’s, and \nT & F’s fees using the lodestar method.

The Figeroux Affidavit \nAt the time the Scheck affidavit was filed in March 2001,  In  December  2001,  while  the  criminal  case  against \nCN & S, on behalf of Louima, sought a protective order  defendant Schwarz was still pending, T & F filed an \npreventing  any  of  the  attorneys  from  discussing  the  affidavit  from  Figeroux,  dated  December  19,  2001 \nmotion  for  fees  in  public.  Based  on  the  threats  from  (“Figeroux Aff.”), in which he alleged that T & F “were \nFigeroux, the past press leaks and the fact that CN & S  forced  to  resign  because  of  ethical  and  strategic \nwere attempting to settle the civil action, CN & S asked  disagreements  with  our  co-counsel  that  made  it \nthis Court to order that all papers filed in connection with  impossible for us to continue to represent the Louimas in \nthe  fee  application  be  sealed.  That  application  was  the way that we believed was appropriate.” (Figeroux Aff. \ngranted on March 12, 2001.  ¶ 2). The affidavit further charged CN & S and Louima \n   with engaging in serious, even criminal, misconduct: \n*44 Thereafter, in response to CN & S’s moving papers, \nT & F filed a Memorandum of Law dated April 18, 2001,  [A]fter CN & S entered the case, \nin which counsel asserted that T & F was “forced off the  representatives  of  the  U.S. \ncase through the elimination of [their] role as co-counsel”  Attorney’s Office, with whom Mr. \n(T & F Mem. at 2), and that they “ ‘resigned’ after they  Thomas  and  I  had  an  excellent \nwere  constructively  discharged  through  the  effective  relationship, called us to tell us that \nelimination of their role as co-counsel.” (Id. at 5).75  they  were  concerned  that  Mr. \n   Scheck was improperly influencing \nWith  respect  to  the  accusation  that  T  &  F  allegedly  witnesses’  testimony  by  meeting \ndisclosed client confidences and secrets, T & F contended  with  witnesses  before  the \nin their initial responsive papers that “[a]t the time the  prosecutors  had  a  chance  to \nalleged statements were made, [T & F] ... were subject to  interview  them,  and  essentially \npublic  criticism  and  misrepresentations  regarding  the  telling the witnesses what to say. \ncircumstances  under  which  they  were  discharged,  or \nforced to resign, from the case.” (T & F Mem. at 9–10). T  *45  (Id.  ¶  12).  According  to  the  affidavit, \n& F also stated in their responsive papers that they “made  “Representatives of the U.S. Attorney’s Office asked us to \ncertain very limited statements to the press describing in  put a stop to this practice.” (Id.) Mr. Figeroux then stated \nbroad, general terms the disagreements among counsel  in his affidavit: \nthat led to their departure from the case, and denying the \naccusations  of  misconduct,”  and  they  contended  that  We  knew  that  Mr.  Scheck  and \n“[n]one  of  these  alleged  statements  constitutes  a  others associated with CN & S had \ndisclosure of protected client information.” (Id. at 2).76 T  been  meeting  with  witnesses, \n& F claimed that they “were mindful of their obligations  sometimes  in  groups,  and \nto Mr. Louima and careful not to say anything more than  “preparing” them in ways that we \nwas necessary to defend their reputations and explain  (and at least some members of the \ntheir sudden departure from the case.” (Id. at 6).

(S. Tr. \nbeing handled by our co-counsel.  I at 125–26). Mr. Scheck also denied the truth of the \nWe raised these concerns with our  statement in Figeroux’s affidavit which read: “Mr. Scheck \nco-counsel on numerous occasions,  was improperly influencing witness testimony by meeting \nbut our concerns were rebuffed and  with  witnesses  before  prosecutors  had  a  chance  to \nignored.  interview them and essentially telling the witnesses what \nto say.” (Id. at 127). Scheck further denied “meeting with \n(Id.)

He not only denied preparing witnesses “in groups,” \nmisconduct by Louima and by CN & S.77  but he stated that neither Thomas or Figeroux had ever \n   told Scheck that they felt he was improperly preparing \n  witnesses, contrary to the claim in the affidavit that “we \nspoke to Mr. Scheck about it, and he refused to listen to \nW.

Scheck also denied \nCN & S sought an order from this Court on January 25,  that  either  Ms.  Palmer  or  anyone  else  from  the  U.S. \n2002, continuing the prior March 12, 2001 Protective  Attorney’s Office ever asked the CN & S lawyers to stop \nOrder and seeking to modify it to prevent “Figeroux and  speaking to witnesses or ever asked Scheck to stop telling \nthose associated with him, in the ‘guise’ of preparation for  witnesses what to say.

He also denied the truth \na result of either privileged conversations with Louima or  of Figeroux’s statement that T & F had spoken to CN & S \nthrough his observations of his client during the course of  about it, but they refused to stop, noting that the only \nthe  representation,  and  thus  Figeroux’s  affidavit  conversation Neufeld had with Figeroux about witnesses \nconstituted a breach of his ethical obligations to Louima.  was one where Figeroux said “there was no point in \n   speaking  to  certain  Haitians  witnesses  because  all \nIn connection with that application, Neufeld submitted an  Haitians lie.” (Id. at 122). \naffidavit  to  this  Court  asserting  that  Figeroux  “has    \nrecently  engaged  in  a  scheme  to  falsely  accuse  Mr.  Scheck testified that to his knowledge, neither the issue of \n  33 \n \n\nLouima v.

Magistrate Judge Pollack declined to make that recommendation “without first affording \nFigeroux an opportunity to respond and provide a justification or explanation for his conduct.” (Id.) This issue is not before the \nCourt at this time. \n \n4  The Court also agrees with Magistrate Judge Pollack’s finding that no forfeiture of the Rubenstein firm’s and CN & S’ attorneys’ \nfees were warranted. \n \n \n1  As a consequence of the untimely and unfortunate death of Mr. Thomas in August 2001, his interest in this matter is being pursued \nby his Estate. (Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Application for Fee Forfeiture and for Recovery of \n \nFees Due (“Estate Mem.”) at 1). Prior to the hearing, an issue arose as to the extent to which conversations with Mr. Thomas could \nbe related by other witnesses in light of the restrictions of the Dead Man’s Statute. That was the subject of a separate Order of this \nCourt dated November 14, 2002, and will not be addressed herein. \n \n2  At the time the Louima family first contacted Messrs. Thomas and Figeroux, the firm of T & F did not exist. The two lawyers \nsubsequently joined as a firm and remained as such until the untimely and unfortunate death of Carl Thomas in August 2001. \n \n(Estate Mem. at 1). For purposes of this Report, the two attorneys will be referred to as “T & F” regardless of whether they had \nformally joined as a firm at the time. Similarly, Messrs. Cochran, Scheck and Neufeld were not joined as a single firm when they \nwere initially retained by Louima. (See Retainer Agreement, dated November 3, 1997, Ex. 2). According to Peter Neufeld, CN & S \nwas formed after the commencement of the Louima litigation so that the lawyers in the firm could focus primarily on civil rights \ncases, “where the cases themselves could perhaps be a basis for systematic reform.” (Transcript of Testimony of Peter Neufeld, \nOctober 24, 2002 (“N. Tr. I”), at 12). For ease of reference, the three attorneys are referred to herein as “CN & S.” \n \n3  CN & S have filed a separate motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C. § \n1927 based on an affidavit filed by Figeroux in connection with the fee proceedings. That motion has not been fully briefed and \n \nwill not be addressed herein. \n \n4  See discussion infra at 59. \n \n \n5  In their original memorandum of law filed prior to the fee hearing, T & F asserted that not only were they entitled to one-third of \nthe total attorneys’ fees as set forth in the fee sharing agreement with CN & S, but they were seeking an award “substantially in \n \nexcess of 50 percent.” (T & F Mem. of Law dated April 18, 2001 at 23–24). However, during the hearing, counsel for T & F \nindicated that they would not seek more than the one-third provided for in the agreement that was entered into between counsel. \n(See Transcript of testimony of Sanford Rubenstein on November 18, 2002 (“R.Tr.”) at 83). Subsequently, in T & F’s post-hearing \nsubmissions, T & F reversed position again, arguing that they were entitled to more than 50% of the total attorneys’ fees. (T & F \nPost–Tr. Br. at 74–76). \n \n6  Since this dispute arises in the context of T & F’s right to enforce a charging lien under N.Y. Jud. Law § 475, it is considered an \nequitable action to which no right to a jury trial attaches. See In re Rosenman & Colin, 850 F.2d 57, 60 (2d Cir.1988) (holding “[i]n \n \nthe context of both attorneys’ liens and other liens, such actions have repeatedly been regarded as equitable in nature so that no \njury right attaches” and citing Damsky v. Zavatt, 289 F.3d 46, 53 (2d Cir.1961)); see also In re King, 168 N.Y. 53, 58–59, 60 N.E. \n1054, 1056 (1901) (holding that an attorney’s lien is an equitable remedy); Flores v.

City of New York, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)   \n \n \n11  Louima could not recall exactly how his brother had gotten the names of Thomas and Figeroux. (L. Tr. at 54). \n \n \n12  Ms. Roper–Simpson’s testimony in this regard is somewhat confusing. At first, she testified that, while she did not have a written \nagreement with Louima, she could not say with certainty whether she had an oral agreement with him. (See Transcript of testimony \n \nof Casilda Roper–Simpson on November 22, 2002 at 178–84). She testified that she could not “positively respond” to the question \nof whether “Abner Louima [ ] or Micheline Louima ever orally retained [her].” (Id. at 178, 506 N.Y.S.2d 885). However, she then \nclaimed during cross-examination, that she suddenly recalled that “when we left the [August 1997] press conference [,] ... Mr. \nLouima expressed his appreciation for us and our involvement in the case as his attorneys and being that I as an attorney was also \nthere, I can also make a legitimate argument that [ ] was an oral agreement [with Mr. Louima].” (Id. at 184, 506 N.Y.S.2d 885). \nSee discussion infra at 139–44. \n \n13  Citations to “R.S.

(L. Tr. at 90). Indeed, in a \ndeposition of Figeroux taken on June 20, 2002, by Ronald Fischetti, Esq., who represented Officer Charles Schwarz in the criminal \n \nprosecution, Figeroux told Fischetti that McAlary had called him. (Ex. 41 at 14; F. Tr. III at 38). \n \n16  Figeroux testified during the deposition by Fischetti that he could not recall whether he was present when Giuliani visited Louima \nin the hospital.

(Testimony of Cathy Palmer, Esq., dated October 25, 2002 (“P.Tr.”) at 3–4). At the time of the hearing, Ms. \n \nPalmer was a litigation partner at Latham & Watkins. (Id. at 3, 506 N.Y.S.2d 885). \n \n20  Ms. Lynch, who did not testify at the hearing, was subsequently appointed as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of \nNew York. \n \n \n21  Mr. Vinegrad joined the Office in January 1990, where he was appointed Chief of Civil Rights Litigation in April 1994, Chief of \nGeneral Crimes in November 1994, and Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division in August 1995. (V. Tr. at 233). He left the Office \n \nto become a partner at Wachtel and Masyr, only to return to the Office as Chief of the Criminal Division in September 1998, \nserving in that position until August 1999 when he became Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney. In June 2001, he was appointed as \nInterim U.S. Attorney. (Id. at 234, 506 N.Y.S.2d 885). At the time of his testimony, Mr. Vinegrad was serving as Senior Litigation \nCounsel in the Office. (Id.) Citations to “V. Tr. at “ refer to pages in the hearing transcript of October 17, 2002 when Alan \nVinegrad testified. \n \n22  According to the testimony of AUSA Palmer, Thompson received the call from Carl Thomas “the night before the McAlary article \nbroke.” (P. Tr. at 7). \n \n \n23  Thompson testified that he did not believe Thomas used the word “sodomized,” but rather that he said “raped.” (T. Tr. at 218). \n \n \n24  Mr. Thompson referred to Mr. Hynes by his nickname, “Joe.” \n \n \n25  The press later reported that there was a “rift” between two factions of the Louima family over the retention of T & F. (Exs.27, 29). \n \n \n26  Citations to “Compas Tr. at “ refer to pages in the transcript of the hearing on November 14, 2002 in which Dr. Jean Claude \nCompas testified. \n \n \n27  The doctor testified that he has also known Roper–Simpson “fairly well” for “maybe ten years.” (Compas Tr. at 166). \nRoper–Simpson, however, denied ever meeting Dr. Compas prior to the Louima matter, although she conceded that the doctor \n \nknew her sister and that the two are often confused with each other. (R.S. Tr. I at 131). \n  65 \n \n\nLouima v. City of New York, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)   \n \n \n28  Rubenstein testified that from time to time, Dr. Compas would refer cases to Rubenstein, but there was no money exchanged in \nconnection with these referrals. (R. Tr. at 31). \n \n \n29  Roper–Simpson kept a diary of her initial involvement with the Louima matter beginning on August 12, 1997 and ending on \nSeptember 4, 1997. (Exs.84, 84–O). \n \n \n30  See also Exhibit 29, quoting Thomas as telling Rubenstein, “ ‘I think you’re an obsequious piece of s ___....You’re a bloodsucker! \nYou only pimp off our community.%” ’ \n \n \n31  Roper–Simpson’s law partner, Emmanuel Roy, testified that he had been told by Dr. Jean Claude Compas that Rubenstein had \nasked Dr. Compas “to get him into the case.” (Testimony of Emmanuel Roy, November 21, 2002 (“Roy Tr.”) at 114, 121). \n \nHowever, this testimony was objected to at the hearing, and indeed is inadmissable hearsay. In addition, Louima denied that Dr. \nCompas played any role in the decision to hire Rubenstein, as did Rubenstein, who denied that he sought out Dr. Compas regarding \nthe case. (L. Tr. at 13; R. Tr. at 34). Perhaps the most important testimony in this regard came from Dr. Compas. Dr. Compas \ndenied that Rubenstein ever asked him to get Rubenstein involved in the case, and Dr. Compas testified that he was not involved in \nthe family’s decision to retain Rubenstein. (Compas Tr. at 173–74). His testimony is corroborated by Ms. Roper–Simpson’s own \nnotes in her personal diary, which state “ ‘Dr. Compas apparently called Rubenstein.” ’ (R.S. Tr. III at 23; Ex. 84). The testimony \nrelating to the retention of Rubenstein and Rynecki is relevant to Ms. Roper–Simpson’s allegations that Mr. Rubenstein violated \nthe Disciplinary Rules by the manner in which he became involved in this case. In this regard, the Court credits the testimony of \nDr. Compas and Mr. Rubenstein and finds no ethical violation in the retention of the Rubenstein Firm. See discussion infra at \n169–74. \n \n32  Rubenstein conceded that he was one of the lawyers who favored the addition of the punitive damages amount in the Amended \nNotice of Claim. (R. Tr. at 70). \n \n \n33  Citations to “C. Tr. I at” refer to pages in the hearing transcript of November 14, 2002 when Johnnie Cochran testified. Citations to \n“C. Tr. II at” refer to pages in the hearing transcript of November 22, 2002. \n \n \n34  Although Cochran’s testimony as to what Ms. Washington said to him is clearly hearsay, no objection was raised to its \nadmissibility at the hearing. (See C. Tr. I at 180). \n \n \n35  Cochran did not recall the date of this visit, but the autographed page from the copy of his book that he gave to Roper–Simpson \nduring that visit is dated August 23, 1997. (Ex. KC–11). Roper–Simpson also could not recall the date, but remembered it was a \n \nSaturday, which August 23, 1997 was. (R.S. Tr. I at 65–66). \n \n36  However, Roper–Simpson did not recall Scheck accompanying Cochran on his first visit to the hospital. (R.S. Tr. I at 67). Indeed, \nit is unclear whether Scheck was present during Cochran’s first, or his second visit to the hospital. Cochran testified that, although \n \nhe could not remember for certain, he thought that Scheck was not present during his first visit. (C. Tr. I at 183). However, Scheck \nrecounted a conversation with Louima, involving Louima’s concern that the retention of additional attorneys would increase the \ncost of the total attorneys’ fees above one third of any eventual recovery (S. Tr. I at 28–29), which Cochran testified occurred \nduring his first visit to the hospital. (C. Tr. I at 188–89). Louima also testified to this conversation, but he recalled it taking place \nduring the second meeting at the hospital. (L. Tr. I at 21–22). \n \n37  According to Figeroux and Roper–Simpson, they were both present for the August 23, 1997 meeting but Thomas was not. (F. Tr. \nIII at 17; R.S. Tr. I at 66–67). \n \n \n38  Roper–Simpson denies that there was any discussion of Cochran’s retention by Louima during that first meeting. (R.S. Tr. I at 70). \n \n \n39  Louima also testified that Scheck and Neufeld were present for this meeting. (L. Tr. at 20). However, this recollection appears to \nbe mistaken since, as set forth in note 36, supra, it is unclear whether Scheck was present, and Cochran testified that Neufeld was \n \nout of town. (C. Tr. I at 192). Indeed, Neufeld testified that he was out of the country until August 26, 1997, and that he first visited \nLouima on that date after learning that he, Cochran and Scheck had been retained to represent Louima. (Testimony of Peter \nNeufeld on October 24, 2002 “N. Tr. I” at 13–14; Citations to “N. Tr. II at” refer to pages in the hearing transcript of October 25, \n2002 when Neufeld testified.) \n \n40  Cochran testified that he could not recall if either Thomas or Figeroux were present at the second meeting. (C. Tr. II at 92). \nHowever, Louima testified that he told Thomas and Figeroux that he had retained Cochran after the fact. (L. Tr. at 109). Indeed, \n \nRoper–Simpson testified that she was not told that Louima intended to hire CN & S until Louima gathered all the attorneys \ntogether at the hospital. (R.S. Tr. I at 76–78). \n \n41  Cochran testified that he was not sure if the retainer was typed on August 25, 1997, or signed on that date, or both. (C. Tr. I at \n190–91, 194). \n \n  66 \n \n\nLouima v. City of New York, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)   \n \n \n42  Roper–Simpson testified that this meeting occurred on the same day as the “lap-top incident,” see discussion infra at 31, which she \ntestified took place on August 25, 1997. (R.S. Tr. I 76–80; R.S. Tr. II at 197). However, Roper–Simpson also testified that Neufeld \n \nattended the meeting at the hospital (R.S. Tr. I at 80), and Neufeld was out of the country until August 26, 1997. (N. Tr. I at 13). \n \n43  Roper–Simpson testified that Cochran was not present at this first meeting of the lawyers; she testified that only Thomas, Figeroux, \nNeufeld, Rubenstein and Scheck were there with her and Louima. (R.S. Tr. I at 76). \n \n \n44  In dividing up the fees, the Agreement referenced the firm of T & F but made no mention of Roper–Simpson, and her signature \ndoes not appear on the document. \n \n \n45  Neufeld testified that he was uncertain as to whether he actually attended this meeting. (N. Tr. II at 265–66). Roper–Simpson \ntestified that this initial joint meeting of attorneys took place immediately after Louima gathered the attorneys in his hospital room \n \nand instructed them to work as a team. (R.S. Tr. I at 81–85). She also testified that Cochran was not present. (Id. at 81, 506 \nN.Y.S.2d 885). \n \n46  Cochran also testified that Mr. Rynecki may have been there. (C. Tr. I at 199). \n \n \n47  Cochran confirmed this testimony, stating that Figeroux got up, used an obscenity and slammed down the top of the computer, \nsaying “ ‘[a]re you trying to f’ing intimidate me by using this technology?” ’ (C. Tr. I at 200). \n \n \n48  Figeroux denied that he was “anti Jewish.” (F. Tr. I at 136). He stated: “Me, I am not anti anything. What I am, you don’t have to \nbe pro something, you don’t have to be anti anything. To be pro for people of color, you don’t have to be anti white or anti Jewish \n \nwhatever. In fact, what I think is that we need to learn from people who have succeeded. Like the Jews, they have succeeded. They \nhave succeeded for specific reasons. If they succeed, then we can emulate that.” (Id.) According to Mrs. Thomas, her husband was \nactive in the Jewish community, serving as a member of the Board of Trustees of Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center. (Transcript \nof Testimony of Elizabeth Thomas, dated December 5, 2002 (“Thomas Tr.”), at 38–39). She testified that she never heard him utter \nanti-Semitic remarks. (Id. at 38, 506 N.Y.S.2d 885). Mr. Thompson also testified that he never heard Thomas make anti-Semitic \ncomments about Scheck or Neufeld nor could he recall ever hearing Thomas make such remarks about anyone. (T. Tr. at 226–27). \n \n49  Roper–Simpson confirmed this view of Thomas, testifying that “[h]e yelled most of the time, I would say a good 60 to 70 percent \nof the time. That’s just the way he spoke. He was a loud person. (R.S. Tr. III at 39). Thompson, however, testified that he did not \n \nconsider Thomas to be “bellicose,” a “yeller and a shouter,” but rather described him as “outspoken.... He was the type of person \nwho was very intelligent and he was a proud person and where others would probably back down, I don’t think Carl would.” (Id. at \n227, 506 N.Y.S.2d 885). \n \n50  Neufeld confirmed that Figeroux was present for at least one interview with Gregory Normil, a cousin of Louima’s, concerning \nthis investigation. (N. Tr. I at 50). \n \n \n51  Scheck, however, testified that he “had knowledge that the first meeting was going to take place.” (S. Tr. I at 67). \n \n \n52  Although Thompson testified that the government learned about the Tacopina meetings sometime prior to the termination of T & \nF’s representation (T. Tr. at 267), Ms. Palmer was adamant that she did not learn of the Tacopina meetings until February or early \n \nMarch of 1998, after the indictment was returned, which occurred on February 26, 1998. (P. Tr. at 45, 47, 49). Scheck, however, \ntestified that Palmer confronted him with her knowledge of the Tacopina meetings “some time in January.” (S. Tr. I at 69). \n \n53  Scheck explained that CN & S did not seek the government’s approval prior to the meetings because if Tacopina related things that \nWeise had said to the authorities during his “GO–15” internal NYPD investigative hearing that might be immunized, CN & S did \n \nnot want the prosecutors to learn information that would possibly taint the prosecution. (S. Tr. I at 67–68). \n \n54  See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). \n \n \n55  At the time, there was a mayoral race in which Mayor Giuliani was running against, among others, Reverend Sharpton and Ruth \nMessinger. (S. Tr. I at 71). \n \n \n56  During this portion of his testimony, Scheck related conversations involving Louima. There were no objections raised to the \nadmission of this testimony. \n \n \n57  This testimony by Figeroux contradicts his prior statement given during the course of an FBI interview on April 18, 2002 in which \nhe told the FBI that “[t]here was nothing about ‘Giuliani time’ on the note” but rather, “Jonas spoke to Figeroux and told Figeroux \n \nabout the ‘Giuliani time’ statement.” (Ex. 44). \n \n  67 \n \n\nLouima v. City of New York, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)   \n \n58  Indeed, she told the FBI that she had never discussed this statement with Louima. (Ex. 45 at 5). \n \n \n59  In addition to the interview with McAlary, and Louima’s statements to the press from his hospital bed, on August 14, 1997, \nThomas and Figeroux appeared on 20/20 with Ted Koppel, and, along with Roper–Simpson, they also appeared on the Gabe \n \nPressman Sunday Morning Show. (R.S. Tr. I at 49). According to Roper–Simpson, “[t]here was a lot of time devoted to the press,” \nparticularly by Thomas and Figeroux. (R.S. Tr. I at 50). \n \n60  Later, it was agreed that Thomas would be the “lead” attorney as far as the public was concerned but Cochran would still be in \ncharge of decision-making. (L. Tr. at 25). However, Louima also instructed the attorneys to clear press matters with him. (Id . at \n \n26–27). \n \n61  T & F argues that Louima’s testimony in this regard is “muddled,” pointing to Louima’s testimony on cross-examination that in \nJanuary 1998, he instructed the attorneys not to speak to the press without prior clearance (L. Tr. at 118), and his later testimony \n \nthat he issued this instruction in response to a Village Voice article dated September 2, 1997. (Id. at 130–31; Ex. 29). This article \nwas published approximately one week prior to that date. (S. Tr. I at 90). However, while Louima’s recollection of the chronology \nof his instructions was vague, it appears that, rather than contradicting himself, Louima may have been referring to distinct \noccasions on which he instructed the attorneys regarding their contacts with the media. (L. Tr. 111–19, 130–31). \n \n62  Rubenstein testified that he obtained Louima’s permission before speaking to Vanity Fair. (R. Tr. at 45; Ex. 27). \n \n \n63  Marie Brenner is the author of the Vanity Fair article. \n \n \n64  See also Ex. 37 (Newsday article dated January 18, 1998 by Jimmy Breslin discussing the retraction.) \n \n \n65  When asked if he was upset at Thomas as well, Louima replied that he didn’t specifically recall any leaks involving Thomas. (L. \nTr. at 31–32). \n \n \n66  Although all of the other witnesses testified that this January 23, 1997 meeting occurred at CN & S’ offices at 99 Hudson Street, \nRoper–Simpson testifed that she was “150 percent” sure that the meeting had been at Rubenstein’s office. (R.S. Tr. III at 139). \n \n \n67  Roper–Simpson testified that what Louima said was: “ ‘Well, last week you had offered your resignation and I’m willing to accept \nyour resignation today if you still want to give it or I have to let you go.’ And then I was in shock, I looked at Brian and then I \n \nlooked at Carl and Carl seemed a little astonished and Carl said, like he went ‘okay’ and we left.” (R.S. Tr. I at 128). Figeroux \ntestified that Rubenstein had earlier said to him “ ‘listen Brian, all you have to do is stay on this case, you do nothing. You collect \nyour money at the end of the case and move on. Do nothing, collect your money. It’s either that or you quit, you’ll be fired.” ’ (F. \nTr. III at 21). \n \n68  Ms. Thomas was asked a series of questions about her husband’s behavior and demeanor around the time of this meeting. She \nstated that although her husband was originally “very excited” and enthusiastic about the case (Thomas Tr. at 44), he “became very \n \ntroubled. He went from being very enthusiastic ... and putting all of his energy [into the case] which he continued right until he \ncame off. But he became increasingly troubled in his interactions with the new team, Mr. Cochran and his team.” (Id. at 47). Ms. \nThomas testified that, prior to attending this meeting in January, Mr. Thomas stated that he “thought .... [t]hat he was going to be \nkicked off the case.” (Id. at 59). Later that night, after this meeting, he came back very upset, breathing heavily. (Id. at 60). \n \n69  Louima identified Exhibit 8 as the letter that was drafted that day after T & F left, instructing them not to talk about Louima’s case. \n(L. Tr. at 30). \n \n \n70  Roper–Simpson stated that the letter came by messenger ten to fifteen minutes after they had returned to Thomas and Figeroux’s \noffice. (R.S. Tr. I at 129). \n \n \n71  See discussion infra at 84–86. \n \n \n72  Although Rubenstein was questioned about this article and asked if he was the source of this information, Rubenstein denied being \nthe one who made these statements to Pierre–Pierre, while at the same time acknowledging that he knew the reporter and had been \n \nasked for information about the Louima matter. (R. Tr. at 63–65). \n \n73  As Roper–Simpson conceded, however, it was Rubenstein who prepared the initial Notice of Claim (R.S. Tr. I at 144–45; R. Tr. at \n39), and that in being critical of the amount, Cochran “was sort of putting down Mr. Rubenstein’s amount that he put [in] the \n \noriginal Notice of Claim.” (R.S. Tr. I at 144–45). \n \n  68 \n \n\nLouima v. City of New York, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)   \n \n74  CN & S later added to their complaint of wrongdoing the allegation that T & F further injured Louima’s interests by alleging in \ntheir fee papers, particularly in the December 19, 2001 Affidavit of Mr. Figeroux, that Louima and CN & S had engaged in a \n \nscheme to suborn perjury. (Affidavit of Peter Neufeld, dated January 25, 2002 (“Neufeld Aff.”), at ¶¶ 8–17; S. Tr. I at 4–6). See \ndiscussion infra, at 79–80. \n \n75  At the hearing, it appears as though T & F are now arguing that they were entitled to resign because they were “never allowed to \nserve in their role as lead counsel” and otherwise were “marginaliz[ed].” (S. Tr. I at 9). \n \n \n76  This claim was, of course, subsequently contradicted by Figeroux’s own testimony at the hearing. (See discussion supra at 75; see \nalso F. Tr. II at 24–25, 27, 40–45). \n \n \n77  It should be noted that not only did these new allegations not appear in the April 18, 2001 Memorandum filed by T & F’s counsel, \nbut the claims were also not made in any of the legal submissions filed by Ms. Roper–Simpson. Although Ms. Roper Simpson’s \n \naffidavit, dated March 29, 2001 (“Roper–Simpson Aff.”), alleges that the manner in which CN & S came into the case constituted \na violation of ethical rules, she says nothing regarding the Tacopina meetings or a change in Louima’s testimony. (Roper–Simpson \nAff. of Mar. 29, 2001 ¶¶ 25–33). \n \n78  Palmer testified that, if she had known that CN & S were interviewing individuals who were potential witnesses in the criminal \ncase without her knowledge or consent, she would have found that to be problematic. (P. Tr. at 73). However, Palmer also stated \n \nthat the government had asked CN & S for assistance on several occasions in investigating certain matters related to the criminal \ncase. (Id. at 70–71). \n \n79  Figeroux conceded that he had read the April 30 article in the New York Sun and that he knew that his December 19th affidavit was \nthe subject of discussion among the lawyers and the judge in the Schwarz trial. (F. Tr. I at 129). \n \n \n80  Thompson testified that Thomas learned about the Tacopina meetings from newspaper accounts. (T. Tr. at 285, 287). The first \nnewspaper accounts of the Tacopina meetings were published in November of 1998. (Id. at 287). \n \n \n81  It is unclear in what way Figeroux believed the error had been remedied. Indeed, as of the date of the hearing no correction had \nbeen filed with this Court. \n \n \n82  Neufeld also was adamant in his conviction that there was “absolutely no change in Abner’s testimony.” (N. Tr. I at 123, 130–134). \nEven Roper–Simpson failed to support Figeroux’s allegations. Indeed, during the fee hearing, Roper–Simpson testified that she \n \nnever saw a change in Louima’s testimony of what had occurred (R.S. Tr. I at 195), and that, apart from the Tacopina meetings, \nshe had never discussed with either Thomas or Figeroux the alleged claim that Scheck was improperly meeting with witnesses and \npreparing them improperly. (Id. at 191–194). \n \n83  It is also clear that the district court may refer a motion for attorney’s fees to the magistrate judge. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)(D). \nPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b), the magistrate judge may enter a report and recommendation determining and fixing the amount of \n \na charging lien. See Butler, Fitzgerald & Potter v. Sequa Corp., 250 F.3d 171, 177 (2d Cir.2001); Rajaratnam v. Moyer, 47 F.3d \n922, 924 n. 5 (7th Cir.1995); Estate of Connors v.. O’Connor, 6 F.3d 656, 658–59 (9th Cir.1993) (stating that it was error for \nmagistrate judge to issue final order, rather than report and recommendation, on post-judgment fees motion); cf. Cohen v. N.Y. City \nHealth & Hosp. Corp., No. 99 CV 3896, 2001 WL 262764, at *1–2 (S.D.N.Y. March 16, 2001) (issuing final order regarding \namount of charging lien without indication that the parties had consented to referral for all purposes to the magistrate judge). \n \n84  Even if this fee issue was not governed by federal law, this Court would have jurisdiction to rule on the dispute under the doctrine \nof supplemental jurisdiction. See Chesley v. Union Carbide Corp., 927 F.2d 60, 64 (2d Cir.1991). \n \n \n85  See also Klein v. Eubank, 87 N.Y.2d 459, 462, 663 N.E.2d 599, 600, 640 N.Y.S.2d 443, 444 (1996) (stating that “under both the \nstatute and our precedents, an attorney’s participation in the proceeding at one point as counsel of record is a sufficient predicate \n \nfor invoking the statute’s protection”). \n \n86  See Roper–Simpson’s Memorandum of Law, dated March 29, 2001 (“R.S.Mem.”) at 10; see also Post Hearing Memorandum of \nLaw of Casilda Roper–Simpson, dated April 21, 2003 (“R.S.Post–Tr.Br.”) at 9. See discussion infra at 139–44. \n \n \n87  In Allen, the attorney sought to terminate his representation because he was “under a misapprehension” of the amount of work that \nwould be required in the case. The Second Department found that there were issues of fact requiring a trial as to whether the \n \nattorney’s unilateral withdrawal was prompted by his own financial concerns, which would effectively constitute abandonment of \nhis client, or whether he withdrew, as he claimed, because of the client’s misconduct. 125 A.D.2d at 279–280, 509 N.Y.S.2d at 50. \n \n88  Although not specifically argued by CN & S here, this Court notes that the various public disclosures by T & F during the course \nof settlement negotiations in this case created problems for the settlement process and prompted the issuance of a gag order when T \n \n& F refused to voluntarily refrain from speaking to the press. \n \n  69 \n \n\nLouima v. City of New York, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)   \n \n89  The Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility have been jointly adopted by the Appellate Divisions of the \nState of New York and are binding upon attorneys practicing in New York. See N.Y. Comp.Codes R. & Regs., tit. 22 §§ 603.2, \n \n691.2, 806.2, 1022.7. \n \n90  A determination that a withdrawal is permissible for an attorney who has appeared on behalf of a client before a court is distinct \nfrom a finding that any termination was or was not “for cause” for purposes of that attorney’s right to compensation. See, e.g., \n \nCasper v. Lew Lieberbaum & Co., Inc., 1999 WL 335334, at *5 (granting motion to withdraw based on irreconcilable conflict but \nfinding that discharge was not “for cause” for purposes of fee determination). \n \n91  Mr. Scheck testified that the meeting at which he addressed the Guiliani time statement with Figeroux was sometime before \nChristmas 1997 (S. Tr. I at 84), which was several weeks before the first printed articles discussing Louima’s retraction of the \n \nGuiliani time statement appeared in the Daily News and The New York Times on January 15, 1998. (See Exs. 35, 36). \n \n92  The Court also notes that it was not until her testimony in the fee proceeding that Roper–Simpson ever raised this claim. (R.S. Tr. \nIII at 167). \n \n \n93  To the extent that T & F attempt to argue that CN & S’ failure to inform them of the Tacopina meetings in violation of the retainer \nagreement was a basis for justifying their withdrawal, this Court finds that T & F did not become aware of the Tacopina meetings \n \nuntil long after the January 23, 1998 termination and thus, the Tacopina meetings could not have been considered by T & F at the \ntime they withdrew as counsel. (See discussion infra at 173–74). \n \n94  Roper–Simpson was not a party to this agreement. \n \n \n95  While the Civil Court’s ruling in General Realty did allow an attorney to testify regarding a privileged communication in the \nabsence of a pending or contemplated civil or criminal proceeding against that attorney, the sole case cited by the Court was \n \nMeyerhofer v. Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 497 F.2d 1190. In Meyerhofer, the attorney invoking D.R. 2–101(C)(4) was a \nnamed defendant in a civil suit. In any event, although not mentioned by the Court in General Realty, the former client in General \nRealty had placed the privileged communication at issue in her landlord-tenant dispute, thereby waiving the privilege as to that \ncommunication. In addition, T & F rely on Stirum v. Whalen, 811 F.Supp. 78, 84 (N.D.N.Y.1993). However, in Stirum the \nattorneys seeking to disclose client confidences were named defendants in a civil action for fraud. Id. \n \n96  Figeroux contends that, contrary to the claims of CN & S, his repetition of the Giuliani time statement to the press does not warrant \nhis forfeiture of fees because Figeroux simply had no reason to believe that Jonas would “invent a lie” or that Louima would \n \nthereafter ratify the statement to the press. (T & F Post–Tr. Br. at 21). T & F contend that it was Figeroux’s trust in Louima and his \nfamily, coupled with Louima’s failure to tell the truth, that led to the problems faced by Louima later during the criminal trials. (Id \n. at 21–22). Although the Court finds that Figeroux’s repetition of the Guiliani time statement to the press without first confirming \nit with Louima was irresponsible and reckless, this incident alone would not, in this Court’s view, justify a forfeiture of fees and \nthe Court has not relied on this incident in reaching its recommendation here. \n \n97  In this regard, the Fifth Circuit has held that even where the client waived the privilege by suing his attorney for malpractice, the \nwaiver does not extend to all subsequent proceedings such as criminal charges in which the communications are relevant. See \n \nUnited States v. Ballard, 779 F.2d 287, 292 (5th Cir.1986). \n \n98  T & F have also contended that their response was “restrained.” (Transcript of Hearing on Oct. 16, 2002 at 9). Not only were T & \nF’s statements to the press anything but restrained, but the suggestion to the press that there were “ethical” problems with the way \n \nthe case was being handled prejudiced Louima individually, by criticizing not only the attorneys but Louima as well, and raising \nissues of his credibility that potentially prejudiced him in the criminal proceedings. \n \n99  Indeed, any diligent investigative reporter could have discovered that Figeroux was the first to repeat the Giuliani time statement \npublicly by doing a simple Lexis–Nexis search. \n \n \n100  T & F also point to a purported quote from Rubenstein in a January 28, 1998 Daily News article that the Giuliani time statement \nwas the subject of a federal probe. (Ex. 14). While Rubenstein admitted that he had provided other information to the author of this \n \narticle, Rubenstein denies making this statement, stating that the language was a mischaracterization of what he actually said. (R. \nTr. at 89–91). Even if Rubenstein had made this statement, it does not invite response from T & F nor does it justify their \nstatements to the press. \n \n101  There has been no evidence of any ethical violations by Ms. Roper–Simpson, who appears to have acted in Louima’s interest at all \ntimes and did not have any discussions with the press that were not authorized. \n \n \n102  She testified during the fee proceeding that she was never an associate in the firm of T & F, nor a partner either. (R.S. Tr. III at \n130). \n \n \n  70 \n \n\nLouima v. City of New York, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)   \n \n103  In addition, D.R. 2–106(d) requires all contingent fee agreements to be documented in a writing provided to the client. D.R. \n2–106(d), 22 N.Y. Comp.Codes R. & Regs., tit. 22, § 1200.11. \n \n \n104  This Retainer Agreement lists Rubenstein & Rynecki, Thomas & Figeroux, and Johnnie Cochran, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld. \n(Ex. 2). Roper–Simpson’s name does not appear anywhere in the document. (Id.) \n \n \n105  Her actions and those of T & F in reaching a fee-splitting agreement also arguably violate the Disciplinary Rules. D.R. 2–107 \nprohibits the division of fees for legal services with an attorney who is not a partner or associate in the lawyer’s firm except with \n \nthe client’s consent. D.R. 2–107, N.Y. Comp.Codes R. & Regs., tit. 22, § 1200.12. \n \n106  He also testified that the firm of T & F was actually created on the same day Figeroux came back from his first visit with Louima \nin the hospital and met with Thomas. (F. Tr. III at 64). From the chronology of events, it appears that Roper–Simpson became \n \ninvolved shortly thereafter. \n \n107  They also claim that they assisted Rubenstein in filing the initial Notice of Claim. (T & F Post–Tr. Br. at 9; Ex. 3). Rubenstein, \nhowever, testified that the initial Notice of Claim was prepared by Mr. Rynecki and brought to Brooklyn Hospital on August 15, \n \n1997 where it was signed by Louima. (R. Tr. at 39). While T & F may have reviewed it prior to the filing, neither Thomas or \nFigeroux signed the Notice of Claim, and Rubenstein’s testimony suggests that his firm did the bulk of the work associated with \nthe first Notice of Claim. \n \n108  Roper–Simpson also claimed that she spent an extended amount of time successfully defending more than a hundred persons \narrested for protesting on Louima’s behalf, which she did without compensation. (R.S. Tr. I at 62–65). However, she failed to \n \npresent any evidence that Louima had authorized her to do such work or more importantly agreed to pay for it. Nor has she \npresented a single authority authorizing payment of fees from one client, without authorization, for work performed for other \nclients in circumstances similar to these. \n \n109  However, the failure to provide contemporaneous time records is not fatal to T & F’s claim for fees. See 601 West Assocs, LLC v. \nKleiser–Walczak Constr. Co., No. 03 CV 7942, 2004 WL 1117901, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 18, 2004). \n \n \n110  Neufeld  testified  that,  although  he  asked  on  more  than  one  occasion  for  any  notes  or  files  that  Thomas,  Figeroux,  or \nRoper–Simpson had kept that related to Louima’s case, he was told that they had no notes or files. (N. Tr. I at 89). During his \n \ndeposition by Mr. Fischetti, Figeroux testified that he did not take any notes of what was said by Louima nor did he recall the \nspecifics of their discussions during the first days. (Ex. 41 at 10). \n \n111  Roper–Simpson testified that “most of the time ... I was sitting [in the hospital] with [Louima], I would be reading a book. My job \nif you will was to make sure that no one spoke to him without an attorney being there.” (R.S. Tr. I at 42) \n \n \n112  Although Neufeld testified that he may have kept some time records related to the Louima matter, neither the CN & S attorneys \nnor Rubenstein have submitted any time records to this Court in support of their motion. \n \n \n113  According to Neufeld, T & F and Roper–Simpson “had absolutely no role” in the research and drafting of the various Complaints, \nExhibits 47, 48 and 49, even though that “research ... was ongoing while they were still involved in the case.” (N. Tr. I at 67). \n \n \n114  Neufeld testified that, in the fall of 1997, when he first mentioned pursuing this novel course of action against the PBA, Thomas \nand Figeroux “thought that the idea was stupid,” and “declined specifically to offer any assistance in the drafting of these \n \npleadings.” (N. Tr. I at 63–64). \n \n115  Although T & F appear to question Rubenstein’s right to recover his share of the fee based on the amount of work he performed, \nthe courts have held that regardless of the amount of an attorney’s contribution, he does not forfeit his fee as long as he never \n \nrefused to contribute more substantially. See, e.g., Sterling v. Miller, 2 A.D.2d 900, 157 N.Y.S.2d 145, 147 (2d Dep’t 1956), aff’d, \n3 N.Y.2d 778, 143 N.E.2d 789, 164 N.Y.S.2d 32 (1957). Of course, with regard to T & F, the mere existence of a retainer \nagreement does not guarantee a right to fees when there has been an unjustified withdrawal and the commission of ethical \nviolations. \n \n116  Figeroux testified that members of Louima’s family were originally opposed to a federal prosecution. (F. Tr. III at 40–41). \n \n \n117  The most recent statement from the escrow agent indicates that, as of June 30, 2004, the value of the total attorneys’ fees held in \nescrow is $3,031,750.16. \n \n \n118  The Court agrees with the Estate’s position that given that the Figeroux Affidavit was submitted after the death of Mr. Thomas, at a \ntime when the partnership would have been dissolved as a matter of law, see N.Y. Partnership Law § 62(4), Figeroux’s misconduct \n \nin this regard cannot be attributed to the Estate, or for that matter to Roper–Simpson, to deprive them of their share of the fees. See \nVollgraff v. Block, 117 Misc.2d 489, 492, 458 N.Y.S.2d 437, 440 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1982) (partnership dissolution discharges former \n  71 \n \n\nLouima v. City of New York, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)   \n \npartner from obligations arising after dissolution). \n \n119  The Court finds Figeroux’s conduct in connection with this fee proceeding to be so beyond the bounds of ethical conduct that it \nwarrants a referral to the Disciplinary Committee of the Bar and a recommendation that he be barred from further practice in this \n \nCourt. However, recognizing the serious consequences of such a referral, the Court will not, at this time, make such a \nrecommendation without first affording Mr. Figeroux an opportunity to respond and provide a justification or explanation for his \nconduct. \n \n120  Even if CN & S’ failure to inform T & F of the Tacopina meetings did constitute a breach of the Agreement, that breach was \nexcused by T & F’s uncooperative and unreliable conduct prior to the Tacopina meetings, and by T & F’s pattern of leaks to the \n \npress. This, therefore, does not constitute grounds to deny CN & S fees. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  72 \n ",

(the \"PBA\"), and Patrick Lynch (\"Lynch\"), Louis Matarazzo (\"Matarazzo\"), Michael\nI  Immitt (\"Immitt\") and Timothy Lee (\"Lee\") (collectively, the \"Individual PBA\nm  Defendants\"), respectfully move pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure (\"Fed. R. Civ. P.\") to dismiss plaintiffs Abner Louima (\"Louima\") and\nm  Micheline Louima's Third Amended Complaint and Jury Demand (the \"Complaint\" or\n•  \"Compl.\") for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.1\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n™  The Complaint does not state a viable claim against the PBA or the Individual\nM  PBA Defendants.  To be sure, it pleads a very real physical injury suffered by Louima\nstemming from an act committed by a police officer, on duty and in uniform, within a\n*  police precinct facility.  But it is there, at least with respect to the PBA, where the\nI\n1  The PBA notes that it is moving against the Third Amended Complaint pursuant to the order of\nMagistrate Judge Pollak dated September 25,2000. However, the PBA has only been served with an\n•  unsigned draft \"proposed\" Third Amended Complaint.\nI\n\nI\nI  Complaint departs from the realm of reality and moves into the area of conjecture,\n•  surmise and legal sophistry.  Plaintiffs allege that the incident leading to Louima's\ninjuries is not the result of actions of one depraved individual, but the product of over\nI  twenty-five years of policies and customs of the City of New York.  Through the\n|  expedient of alleging that these policies and customs were developed and maintained at\nthe \"behest and in close conjunction with the PBA,\" plaintiffs seek to lay responsibility\n§  for Louima's injuries on the PBA, the collective bargaining agent for New York City\n|  Police Officers.  Plaintiffs attempt to buttress this position by alleging that the PBA\nshould be held accountable for the acts of police officers, committed within the scope of\nI  their employment by the New York Police Department.  This proposition, in light of the\nI  clear language of the City Charter, the New York City Collective Bargaining Law and\nprinciples of agency law, is plainly false and transparently an attempt to blur the lines of\nI  responsibility between the employer City and the union, which is chartered to act as an\n•  advocate for its membership.\nEven according to plaintiffs' allegations, the PBA did not become involved in the\n™  facts underlying this case until August 13 ~ the day Louima was released from custody\nI  and four days after Louima's physical injuries were sustained, confirming the absence of\nany causal link between those injuries and any acts committed by the PBA. Based on\nthese and other legal infirmities set forth below, plaintiffs have failed to plead adequately\nI  a basis of liability against the PBA for physical injuries suffered by Louima or his alleged\n—  wrongful detention.\nAs to the alleged activities of the PBA which post-date Louima's release from\nJ  custody, the Complaint fails to allege a constitutional injury arising from those actions\n\n|  that would support a claim against the PBA.  Louima has had his day in court — six\nm  police officers have been convicted of crimes — and his civil action proceeds apace.\nSimilarly, Louima has not alleged that his relations have been restricted so as to\nj[  constitute a violation of his right to free association.\nm  In short, all of plaintiffs' claims are inadequately pled as against the PBA.  That is\nnot because Louima did not suffer a serious injury, which he clearly did.  It is because\nt§  the injuries he suffered are not properly redressed by the federal civil rights laws and\n•  because the PBA is not a proper party to this action. Until such time as the legislature\ngrants the PBA the right to hire, train, supervise, discipline and fire New York City\nW  Police Officers, the responsibility for acts such as the one perpetrated upon Louima lie\nI  with the City, the police department, and the individual police officer.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n™  For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the allegations in the\nM  Complaint.  According to the Complaint, on August 9,1997 Louima was arrested outside\nthe Rendez-Vous nightclub in Brooklyn, New York.  Compl. If 4,34.  On route to the\n*  70th precinct, the patrol car stopped twice and Louima was beaten while police officers\n•  are alleged to have hurled racial and ethnic epithets at him.  Comp. ff 4, 37. At the\n  precinct, Louima was assaulted and sodomized by defendant Justin Volpe (\"Volpe\").\nm\nCompl. ff 5, 6,41,42.\nI  Volpe also is alleged to have threatened to kill Louima and his family if Louima\n£  reported the assault.  Compl. Iff 9,46.  Plaintiffs allege that none of the officers at the\nprecinct made any effort to stop Louima's assault or to report it to the proper authorities,\nf  Compl. t1f 7, 54.\ni\ni\n\nI\nm  It is alleged that, immediately after the assault, Louima was taken to a holding cell\nm  where he was lodged before being transported to Coney Island Hospital.  Compl. ffl! 10,\n63.  When Emergency Medical Services was summoned, Louima told the medical\nm  technicians what had occurred.  Compl. f 11. The technicians are alleged to have delayed\nft  treatment and filed a false report with the intent of assisting the police in covering up the\nincident.  Compl. tU  11,64.\n•  The Complaint further alleges that, from August 9 until August 13, when criminal\nft  charges against Louima were dropped, he was handcuffed to his hospitable bed as he\nconvalesced.  Compl. Tffl 12, 68. Although the New York Police Department's Internal\n\"  Affairs Bureau had been notified of the assault on August 10, no police officer was\nI  questioned until August 13. Compl. ^[ 82. According to the Complaint, this delay created\na \"window of opportunity\" in which evidence was allegedly removed and cover stories\n*  were allegedly created. Compl. ^ 83.\nI  After the attack, it is alleged that the PBA attempted to cover-up the incident.\nCompl. ff  14,71.  On or about August 13,1997, certain officers, including defendants\nVolpe, Wiese, Schwarz and Bruder, are alleged to have met with PBA agents who heard\nI  incriminating admissions which, according to the Complaint, the PBA agents had an\nf  obligation to report.  Compl. fH71,72.  The PBA and its police officer agents then\nallegedly adopted and orchestrated an affirmative strategy of obstruction and\n£  falsification, which included helping several of the individual defendants to devise an\nA  exculpatory version of what happened.  Compl. ffl[ 1,14.\nOn August 13, four days after the incident, Officer Wiese is alleged to have\nm  convened a meeting in the basement of the 70th precinct with Immitt and the officers most\n1\n\nI\n(  directly implicated in the attack on Louima.  Compl. 172.  At this meeting, the officers\ntk  allegedly concocted a common story and discussed ways to intimidate Louima.  Compl. f\n72, 73. The Complaint charges that the officers discussed a plan to claim that Louima's\n•  injuries resulted from consensual sexual activities.  Compl. f 74. Thereafter, Immitt\n•  allegedly appeared at the 70th precinct for several days, to urge officers to remain silent\nabout the incident.  Compl. ^ 75. Immitt and Lee (a PBA delegate) purportedly attempted\n•  to dissuade officers from coming forward to explain what happened.  Compl. 1f 76. The\nI  PBA's attempted cover-up of wrongdoing is alleged to be the direct result of its policies,\ncustoms and practices. Compl. If 79.\n•  As another prong of the attenuated theory of causation set forth in the Complaint,\nI  plaintiffs allege that the City and the PBA, also contributed to the attack on Louima by\nmaintaining a so-called \"code of silence\" or \"blue wall\" which emboldens officers to act\n•  violently and assures that otherwise honest officers remain silent or lie about what they\nI  know.  Compl. fl 15,20. The City's policy of waiting forty-eight hours before\n  questioning police officers accused of wrongdoing (the \"48 hour rule\") is alleged to be a\nm\ncontributing factor to the \"code of silence.\" Compl. Tf 16. These policies and practices are\nI  alleged to have created an atmosphere where the most violent police officers felt assured\ng  that acts of misconduct would not be swiftly and effectively investigated and prosecuted.\nCompl. 1184.\n|  The Complaint acknowledges that the PBA is a labor union representing\n|  approximately 29,000 New York City police officers (Compl. 125), and that the\nrelationship between the PBA, its members and the City of New York is governed by a\nI  collective bargaining agreement and by the rules and regulations of the New York Police\nI\nI\n\nI\nDepartment (\"NYPD\" or the \"Department\") which are set forth in a document known as\nM the \"Patrol Guide.\" Compl. f 25\nThe Complaint also recites that the Patrol Guide provides that an officer subject to\nm  an official administrative investigation must be given two days notice before being\ntt  questioned.  Compl. 180.  Officers who are witnesses to alleged wrongdoing are given\nfour hours notice before they may be questioned.  Compl. f 80. Plaintiffs allege that the\nP  City has created a custom of extending the \"48 hour rule\" to criminal as well as\nB  administrative investigations and has granted the PB A a role in deciding who are\nwitnesses and who are suspects for purposes of invocation of the \"48 hour rule\" — even\n\"  for criminal investigations — and that it did so in this case.  Compl. ffif 80-82.\n•  It is alleged that Lynch and Matarazzo are, respectively, the present and former\ni  President of the PB A.  Compl. ff 27,28. No other allegation is made against Lynch or\n•  Matarazzo except, in the most conclusory terms, they are alleged to have been involved\nI  in negligently training, monitoring and supervising PBA representatives.  Compl. f 179.\nL  CAUSES OF ACTION\nPlaintiffs allege twenty-three causes of action, eleven of which are directed at the\nI  PBA.\nI *  Count II alleges a conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 between the PBA and the\nindividual defendants to deprive Louima of his constitutional rights by attempting to\ncover up the assault on Louima.\nI  •  Count VII alleges that the PBA and the individual defendants deprived Louima of his\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment Rights to have access to, and seek redress in, the\nft  courts as a result of the attempted cover up.\nCount Vin alleges a conspiracy with racial animus pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\nI  bbeettwweeeenn  tthhee  iinnddiivviidduuaall  ddeeffeennddaannttss  aanndd  tthhee  PPBBAA  Ibased on the individual defendants'\nuse of racial and ethnic epithets toward Louima.\nI\nI\n\n•  Count IX alleges a conspiracy to hinder provision of equal protection pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1985(3) as a result of the attempted cover up.\n•  Count X alleges a conspiracy to impede due course of justice pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n1985(2) between the individual defendants and the PBA.\n•  Count XI alleges a conspiracy to obstruct federal justice pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n1985(2) between the individual defendants and the PBA by trying to deter witnesses\nfrom giving testimony in a federal grand jury and in a federal proceeding.\n•  Count XII alleges that the PBA neglected to prevent a 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)\nconspiracy in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1986.\n•  Count XTV is stylized as a systemic claim against the City and the PBA.  It alleges\nthat the City and the PBA have created an environment that encourages police\nbrutality which led to Louima's rights being violated.\n•  Count XV alleges a conspiracy pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 between the City and\nthe PBA to create customs and policies that allow for the most \"brazenly brutal\nofficers to believe that they can use excessive force with impunity.\"\n•  Count XVI alleges claims for gross negligence and negligence against the PBA,\nImmitt, Matarazzo and Lynch for failure to perform a purported duty \"to make sure\nthat its members and its agents, who are also police officers, do not violate their\nduties as police officers.\"  (Compl. ^f 180).\n•  Count XIX alleges intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress against\nthe PBA, Immitt and Lee for impeding the investigation into Louima's assault and for\nspreading rumors that Louima suffered injuries as the result of consensual sexual\nactivity.\n•  Count XXV asserts a pendent claim by Micheline Louima.\nARGUMENT\nIn deciding a motion to dismiss, the function of this Court is to assess the legal\nfeasibility of the complaint.  See Darius v. City of New York Dep't of Corrections. 1998\nWL 724055, *1 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 13) (Johnson, J.). The complaint must set forth sufficient\ninformation to allow the court to determine if there is any recognized legal theory upon\nwhich relief can be granted. See District of Columbia v. Air Florida. Inc. 750 F.2d 1077,\n1078 (D.C. Cir. 1984). The failure to allege any fact connecting defendant to the alleged\n\nI\nI\nwrong or to allege that any wrong has been committed is fatally defective.  See Kadar\nI Corp. v. Millburv. 549 F.2d 230, 233 (1st Cir. 1977); Sutton v. Eastern Viavi Co.. 138\nF.2d 959 (7th Cir. 1943).\nI\nWhile the pleading standard is generally a liberal one, bald assertions and\nI conclusions of law will not suffice.  See Leeds v. Meltz. 85 F.3d 51, 53 (2nd Cir. 1996).\nIf conclusory allegations are not supported by allegations of material facts, the claims are\nI\nsubject to dismissal.  See, e^, Duncan v. AT &T Communications. Inc.. 668 F. Supp.\nI 232, 234 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). Conclusory allegations may also be disregarded if they are\ncontradicted by other facts alleged, by documents incorporated into the complaint, or by\nI\nfacts that are subject to judicial notice.  See, e.g.. Gersten v. Rundle. 833 F. Supp. 906,\nI 910(S.D.Fla. 1993), affd, 56 F.3d 1389 (11th Cir. 1995) (court need not accept\nallegations in complaint when facts alleged in complaint are internally inconsistent);\nI\nBarnum v. Millbrook Care Ltd. Partnership. 850 F. Supp. 1227,1233 (S.D.N.Y. 1994),\nI affd. 43 F.3d 1458 (2nd Cir. 1994) (allegations may be ignored if contradicted by\ndocuments incorporated in complaint).\nI\nI.  PLAINTIFFS' FEDERAL LAW\nI\nCLAIMS SHOULD BE DISMISSED\nPlaintiffs assert nine claims against the PBA seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. §§\nI\n1983,1985 and 1986. Those claims are set forth in counts II, VII, VIE, IX, X, XI, XII,\nI\nXTV, and XV of the Complaint.  Plaintiffs assert federal claims against Immitt and Lee in\nI counts n, VII, VIII, DC, X, XI and XII.2 All of these claims should be dismissed for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\nI\nI\nNo federal claims are asserted against Matarazzo and Lynch.\nI\n\nA.  Plaintiffs' Claims Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nShould Be Dismissed For Failure To Plead State Action\nJ[  It is axiomatic that 42 U.S.C. § 1983 only provides remedies for constitutional\n,mm  injuries caused by persons who either are state actors or are acting under color of state\nlaw.  See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn. 457 U.S. 830, 838 (1982). 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides,\n|  in relevant part, that\n§ Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,\nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or\nthe District of Columbia, subjects or causes to be subjected,\nf\nany citizen of the United States or other person within the\njurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,\n«\nprivileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and\nlaws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,\nsuit in equity or other proper proceeding for redress\nM  Accordingly, in order to plead a § 1983 claim, \"a plaintiff must allege facts that would\nestablish that a governmental entity deprived her of a right secured by law.\" Williams v.\n(  Citv of New York Dep't of Corrections. 1998 WL 160988, *2 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30,1998)\ntt  (Johnson, J.).\n1.  Counts n,VH, XIV And XV\n(\nShould Be Dismissed Because\nThe PBA Is Not A State Actor\nI  Plaintiffs do not (and cannot) allege that the PBA is a governmental entity.\n^  Therefore, in order to assert a § 1983 claim, plaintiffs must allege facts suggesting that\n™  the NYPD is responsible for the PBA or that the PBA was acting under color of state law\n•  when it engaged in the alleged wrongful conduct set forth in the Complaint.  See Jackson\ng  v. Temple University. 721 F.2d 931 (3rd Cir. 1983) (affirming district court's dismissal of\n§ 1983 action against labor union for public employees and holding that there were no\nI  facts alleged that established that the union's actions could be fairly attributable to the\ni\ni\n\nt\ng  state). However, other than the conclusory statement that the PBA was \"acting under\n£  color of law\" (Compl. f % 107,112), no such factual allegations appear in the Complaint.\nThe issue of whether the PBA is a state actor for purposes of § 1983 has already\ng  been decided in the negative.  See, e^g., Wright v. Patrolmen's Benevolent Ass'n. 1975\ng  WL 215 (S.D.N.Y. July 30, 1975). In Wright, the court granted the defendant union's\nmotion to dismiss, holding that\nQ  although the issue was not raised by any party, any action\narising under... Section 1983 must involve state action ...\nf .  The moving defendants are a labor union and three of its\nofficials.  The union is independently funded, operating\nseparately from the police department, and in no way\nt\nintertwined with it, except to the extent that its members\nare policemen.\n|  I&at*l.\nMoreover, when officers of a public employee union commit acts in their\n9  capacities as union members, they are not acting as state actors for purposes of § 1983.\n|  See, e^  Kem v. Citv of Rochester. 93 F.3d 38 (2nd Cir. 1996). In Kern, plaintiff\nemployee of the Rochester Firefighter's union, alleged that her superior, the union\n™  president (\"Cavuoto\"), had sexually harassed her on numerous occasions, and thus\n•  violated her equal protection rights. Id at 41. Plaintiff alleged that Cavuoto was acting\nunder color of state law because he was simultaneously employed by the Rochester Fire\n\"  Department (the \"RFD\") during the period in which he allegedly harassed her.  The\n•  district court disagreed, granting defendants' motion to dismiss on the grounds that\ng  Cavuoto, although a lieutenant in the RFD during the time in which the alleged\nharassment took place, was acting solely in his capacity as union president during the\nI  course of his harassment of plaintiff.\nI\n10\nI\n\n|  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that\nm  plaintiff \"fails to demonstrate that Cavuoto exercised power possessed by virtue of state\nlaw and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state\nB  law.\"  Id at 43 (internal citations omitted). In support of its conclusion, the Court noted\nm  that Cavuoto did not hold his position as union president by virtue of any action of the\ncity and that he performed functions solely for the benefit of the union, not the city.  Id,\n•  see also Jackson. 721 F.2d at 932  (holding that union could not be held liable for\n•  wrongful termination of public employee under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because union was not\nacting under color of state law).\nm  Here plaintiffs fail to allege any \"state action\" taken by the PB A to deny their\nI  rights. Rather, the Complaint asserts that the PBA's agents took part in ^post facto\nconspiracy to conceal and cover-up the alleged wrongful conduct perpetrated on Louima.\n•  These allegations against the PBA's agents relate to their role as union officials\nI  performing necessary union functions such as representing members in connection with\ndisciplinary proceedings.  As in Kem. the mere fact that the PBA's agents happen to also\n\"  be police officers does not mean that they acted under color of state authority.\nI  Accordingly, Counts II, VII, XTV and XV should be dismissed.\n2.  Counts XIV And XV Should Be Dismissed Because\n1\nPlaintiffs Have Not Adequately Alleged That The\nPBA Conspired With A State Actor\nI  Private entities that are not state actors may be held liable under § 1983 if they are\nI  alleged to have conspired with a state actor.  See Storck v. Suffolk County Dep't of\nSocial Services. 62 F.Supp.2d 927,940 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). However, Plaintiffs'\nI\n11\n\nallegations in support of Counts XTV and XV of the Complaint do not adequately allege a\nconspiracy between the PBA and the City sufficient to meet the state actor requirement.\nIn order to state a conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, plaintiffs must\nallege that wrongful conduct (1) was committed by a person acting under color of state\nlaw and (2) deprived a person of rights or privileges secured by the Constitution or the\nlaws of the United States. Hazan v. City of New York. 1999 WL 493352 *2 (S.D.N.Y.\n1999). citing Pitchell v. Callan. 13 F.3d 545, 547 (2nd Cir. 1994). However, conclusory\nallegations of conspiracy such as those set forth in the Complaint provide an insufficient\nbasis for § 1983 liability.  See Staeman v. Rvan. 176 F.3d 986,1003 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"a\nbare allegation of a conspiracy between private and state entities is insufficient to bring\nthe private entity within the scope of Section 1983\"). Rather, to plead a conspiracy under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983\nplaintiff must allege with at least some degree of\nparticularity overt acts which defendants engaged in which\nwere reasonably related to the promotion of the claimed\nconspiracy. A complaint containing only conclusory, vague\nor general allegations of conspiracy to deprive a person of\nconstitutional rights cannot withstand a motion to dismiss.\nSerbalik v. Gray. 27 F. Supp.2d 127,132 (N.D.N.Y. 1998) (emphasis added) (citations\nomitted). Moreover, \"complaints ... must include specific allegations of facts showing a\nviolation of rights 'instead of a litany of general conclusions that shock but have no\nmeaning.\"'  See Waldron v. Rotzler. 862 F. Supp. 763 ,768 (N.D.N.Y. 1994) (citing Ban;\nv. Abrams. 810 F.2d 358, 363 (2nd Cir. 1987)). The plaintiff must provide \"details of\ntime and place and the alleged effect of the conspiracy.\"  2A Moore's Federal Practice §\n8.17 (6) at 8-109 to 8-110 (2d ed. 1992).\n12\n\nI\nI  Here, Plaintiffs' allegations fall far short of stating a viable claim of conspiracy\n|  between the PBA and the City.  Plaintiffs do not even attempt to allege the existence of\nany agreement to develop and maintain \"policies and customs exhibiting deliberate\nI  indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens\" (Compl. ^| 149), let alone to attribute\n( any specificity to the time, place or nature of such agreement.  Nor do Plaintiffs\nparticularize the overt acts allegedly taken by the PBA.  Absent a well-pleaded\nI  conspiracy, there is no nexus between the acts of the PBA and the acts of the City.\n|  Accordingly, the PBA cannot be charged with liability as a state actor under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983, and Counts XTV and XV should be dismissed.\nI  B.  The Federal Claims Should Be Dismissed\nBecause The PBA Cannot Be Held\nI  Liable For The Acts Of Its Members\n1.  The PBA Does Not Owe\n•  A Legal Duty To Third Parties\nIn Counts XTV and XV, plaintiffs allege that the City and the PBA violated\nI\nP  Louima's constitutional rights by creating an atmosphere conducive to police brutality.\nI  Plaintiffs claim that \"practices and customs of the City of New York... have caused\npolice officers, including the officer defendants in this case, to believe that they can\n*  violate the rights of citizens with impunity,\" (Compl. U 167) and that this culture exists\nI  \"because of, rather than despite, the efforts of the PBA.\"  Compl. 1168.4\ng  3  Moreover, to the extent plaintiffs rely on acts of conspiracy that allegedly occurred twenty-five\nyears ago, such reliance is misplaced. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held\nI that a plaintiff may not base § 1983 conspiracy claims on acts occurring more than three years prior to the\nfiling of his complaint. See Pinaud v. County of Suffolk. 52 F.3d 1139,1153-4 (2d Cir. 1995); Singleton v.\nCitv of New York. 632 F.2d 185 (2d Cir. 1980), cert, denied. 450 U.S. 920 (1981).\nI\n4  Count XVI sets forth the same allegations in support of plaintiffs negligence claims, asserting that\nthe PBA's policies and practices negligently \"created an atmosphere\" where officers believed that\nmisconduct would not be \"effectively investigated and prosecuted.\" Compl. f 184.\nI\nI\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the PBA helped to create an atmosphere conducive to police\nbrutality by: (1) promoting the \"48 hour rule\" as a tool to \"assist target officers in\nconspiring to cover up their crimes,\" (Compl. f 155, 156); (2) failing to require its\ndelegates to report crimes and misconduct imparted from the targets of investigations,\n(Compl. |Tf 155, 180); (3) supporting a \"code of silence\" which hinders police officers\nfrom reporting fellow officer's misconduct, (Compl. ff  168-174); (4) using the attorney-\nclient privilege and delegate-member privilege \"to orchestrate cover ups,\" (Compl. f\n172); and (5) requesting that the City \"develop[] and maintain[] policies and customs\nexhibiting deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of its citizens.\" Compl. f\n149.\nHowever, plaintiffs seek to create a basis for liability against the PBA by\nconflating the role of the PBA, a collective bargaining agent, with the role of the NYPD,\nthe organization charged with the training and supervising police officers. See New York\nCity Charter Ch. 18 § 434 (stating that the police commissioner \"shall have cognizance\nand control of the government, administration, disposition and discipline of...  the police\nforce of the department.\").5 By blurring the relationship between the PBA and the City,\nplaintiffs seek redress against the PBA for injuries that were never contemplated by the\ncivil rights laws or intended to be asserted against private entities. Plaintiffs' claims\nfounder against the PBA because the PBA does not employ police officers, does not\ncontrol the conduct of police officers, and indeed does not interact with the public.\nRather, the PBA is an advocate for the interests of its members and is not legally\n5  Additionally, as the New York City Collective Bargaining Law states: \"[i]t is the right of the city.\n. .to ... direct its employees; take disciplinary action; ... [and] determine the methods, means and\npersonnel by which government operations are to be conductedf.]  Decisions of the city... on those\nmatters are not within the scope of collective bargainingf.]\" N.Y.C.

Supp. 68 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (Nickerson, L).\nIn Lizzi. plaintiff alleged that the Letter Carriers1 Union (the \"Union\") was\nB  responsible for an act of sexual molestation committed by one of its members. The union\nm  member had been arrested for public lewdness, and the Postal Service sought to fire or\ntransfer him.  Id at 68-69. The Union filed a grievance on behalf of the member,\nI  resulting in his reinstatement.  Id at 69. The plaintiff in Lizzi alleged that the\n•  molestation occurred only because the Union permitted the member to come into contact\nwith plaintiffs daughter.\nW  In granting the Union's motion to dismiss, the court held that the Union had a\n•  duty to represent its members and that duty required the Union to pursue a grievance on\nits member's behalf.  Id. The court rejected plaintiffs contention that the union's\n•  successful representation of its member could give rise to liability to a third party:\nt\nit is fatuous to suppose that because [a union successfully\nasserts and protects the rights of a member] the union\nshould be liable for injuries thereafter inflicted by the\nI  employee on a member of the public. A union is an\n•  advocate, riot a judge guarding the interests of putative\nthird persons.  It should not be required, at peril of being\nI\nheld liable at the hands either of the employee or of a third\nparty, to conclude that the employee's version of the facts is\n( e r r o n e o us  or to determine in advance the eventual decision\nof the employer or the arbitrator.\n^  Jd. (emphasis added). Similarly, in Percuoco v. Hampton House Condominium. 765 F.\nSupp. 149,151 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) affd. 952 F.2d 393 (2nd Cir. 1991), the court held that a\nI  union could not be held liable for the acts of its member, a security guard, whose\n|  negligence allegedly contributed to plaintiffs assault by a third party, where the union\nhad prevented its member's termination through a successful grievance procedure.\nI\n15\nI\n\nI\nI  In short, Lizzi and Percuoco stand for the proposition that a union is not legally\n*  responsible for torts committed by its members.  Moreover, unions have been held not\nliable in tort for actions taken in their capacity as unions (as opposed to their capacity as a\nI  business, land-owner, or employer).  See Burns Jackson Miller Summitt & Spitzer v.\n|  Lindner. 59 N.Y.2d 314, 464 N.Y.S.2d 712 (N.Y. 1983) (Transit workers not liable for\ndamages caused by their decision to strike); Jamur Productions Corp. v. Quill. 51\nI  Misc.2d 501, 273 N.Y.S.2d 348 (Sup.Ct. N.Y. Co. 1966) (same).  Courts have extended\n•  this rule even when the union's actions affect public safety.  See e.g. White v.\nInternational Association of Firefighters. Local 42. 738 S.W.2d 933 (Mo. App. W.D.\n*  1987) (holding that firefighters could not be liable in tort for fire damages to property\nI  where illegal strike lead to property damage due to fire).\nContrary to plaintiffs' allegations, the PBA does not have a legal duty to \"make\n•  sure its members and its agents, who are also police officers, do not violate their duties as\nI  police officers to report crimes and misconduct by fellow officers.\"  Compl. U 180. That\nlegal duty resides solely with the City. New York City Charter Ch. 18 § 434. To the\ncontrary, the PBA is duty bound to maintain the confidences of its members during the\nI  course of employer-initiated disciplinary proceedings.  See City of Newburgh v.\n-  Newman. 70 A.D. 2d 362,421 N.Y.S.2d 673 (3d Dep't 1979).\nIn City of Newburgh. the Appellate Division held that it was improper for the\nI  City to question a PBA official about conversations he had with a police officer\n•  concerning disciplinary charges brought against the officer.  Id. at 363. The Court held\nthat such conversations between union representatives and members are confidential and\nI  protected against disclosure:\nI\n16\n\nI\nI  To invade that confidentiality tends to inhibit the\nemployees from seeking the advice of their union\nA  representatives as to matters affecting their interest and\nI  similarly to deter the representatives from proffering\nadvice, if sought.  Thus, questioning by responsible\nf representatives of an employer as to private internal union\naffairs such as events transpiring during discussions\nrelating to the rights of employees in the face of anticipated\nt\ndisciplinary charges interferes with the full measure of the\nI protected right of organization and representation accorded\nId 70 A.D.2d abt y3 6th5e, 4T2a1y lNor.Y L.aSw.2.d at 675. Contrary to plaintiffs' allegations, the PBA\nI cannot be held liable for failing to divulge wrongdoing by its members.  Rather, PBA\nofficials owe an obligation to PBA members not to reveal to the police department\nP  confessions of wrongdoing.\nI 2.  The PBA Is Not Liable Under\nA Theory Of Respondeat Superior\n|  In paragraph eighty-four of the Complaint, plaintiffs allege that the PBA is liable\nfor the acts of individual defendants under the doctrine of respondeat superior.  However,\nI  in actions brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, personal participation is an essential\nI  allegation, and the doctrine of respondeat superior is not applicable.  See, e.g.. Austin v.\nParamount Parks. Inc.. 195 F.3d 715,727-28 (4th Cir. 1999) (private corporation sued\n\"  under § 1983 is not subject to respondeat superior liability); Jones v. Sabis Educational\n[  Systems. Inc.. 52 F. Supp.2d 868, 878 (N.D. 111. 1999) (\"a private corporation is not\nvicariously liable under § 1983 for its employees' deprivations of others' civil rights\");\nSheridan v. Andrus. 465 F.Supp. 662 (D.Colo. 1979). Rather, to hold a defendant liable\nI  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, whether for money damages or for injunctive relief, the plaintiff\n•  must allege that the defendant had individual and personal knowledge of, or affirmatively\nparticipated in conduct constituting deprivation of the plaintiffs constitutional rights. S_eg\n17\n\nShepherd v. Sanchez. 2000 U.S. Dist. Lexis 10161 at * 8 (S.D.N.Y. July 21, 2000) Here,\nplaintiffs do not allege any PBA involvement in the assault on Louima and do not allege\ndirect conduct by the PBA constituting a deprivation of Louima's constitutional rights.\nMoreover, the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply to a claim brought\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1985 when the plaintiff seeks money damages, as distinguished from\nequitable relief. S_ee Adams v. Pate. 445 F.2d 105,107 (7th Cir. 1971). Here, plaintiffs\nseeks only money damages from the PBA.\nC.  Plaintiffs Have Failed To Allege That\nThey Suffered Constitutional Injury As\nThe Result Of The PBA's Actions\nIn order to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must allege that he\nsuffered a constitutional injury as the result of defendant's acts. People United for\nChildren v. Citv of New York. 108 F.Supp.2d 275,302 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). Here, plaintiffs\ndo not set forth such allegations against the PBA. Accordingly, Counts n, VH, DC, X and\nXI should be dismissed\n1.  Counts II And VII Do Not Allege\nConstitutional Injury Caused By The PBA\nIn Counts II and VII of the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Louima sustained\nvarious constitutional injuries as the result of the PBA's alleged conspiracy to conceal the\nwrongful acts perpetrated against him.  Compl. U1f 94,108. Count II alleges that Louima\nwas deprived of his constitutional rights to be \"free from unreasonable seizure, to\nassociate and speak freely, and to have access to and seek redress from the courts.\"\nCompl. % 93. In Count VII, plaintiffs allege that the PBA denied Louima's \"First and\nFourteenth Amendment rights to have access to and seek redress in the courts.\" Compl. H\n107.\n18\n\nI\ng  According to the Complaint, the assault on Louima took place on August 9, 1997.\nm  Compl. % 4. The earliest date on which the PBA is alleged to have become involved in a\nsupposed cover-up is August 13, 1997. Compl. 172.6  August 13 is also the date on\n£  which all charges against Louima were dropped and he was released from incarceration\nm  Compl. f 12. Thus, based on plaintiffs' own allegations, none of the alleged wrongdoing\nby the PBA could have caused any deprivation of Louima's rights from August 9 to\nf|  August 13.\nA  Moreover, plaintiffs do not allege that the PBA knew of or contributed to\nLouima's arrest. Thus, any injuries allegedly sustained as the result of Louima's\nW  \"unreasonable seizure\" could not give rise to liability against the PBA. Nor did any of\n•  the PBA's alleged actions affect Louima's rights to free association.  See Angola v.\nCiviletti. 666 F.2d 1, 7 (2nd Cir. 1981) (the right to free association is \"restricted to\nP  relationships having a predominantly political focus\").  Furthermore, Louima does not\nI  identify any First Amendment forum to which he has been denied access, and plaintiffs'\naccess to the courts is evidenced by the existence of this case and the criminal\n•  convictions of several officers on duty at the 70th precinct that evening.  Compl. ^ 3; see\nI  Griffin v. Holy. 1996 WL 556969 (N.D.IU. Sep. 26,1996).\nIn Griffin, the court dismissed § 1983 conspiracy claims in a case in which a\nplaintiff alleged that a number of police officers falsified their reports to indicate that\nf  plaintiff had shot himself when one of the officers had done so. The plaintiff argued that\n,  this cover-up had prevented the plaintiff from seeking effective legal redress. The court\nrejected this argument, holding that where a plaintiff \"was personally involved in his\n6  A former PBA official named Abbate is alleged to have participated in a cover-up at an\nunspecified earlier date (Compl. *|[ 70), but the acts of this alleged former employee, as set forth in the\n19\n\nI  arrest... and therefore possesses firsthand knowledge of the facts\" a § 1983 conspiracy\nI  claim can not survive. Id. at *4; see also Thompson v. Boggs. 33 F.3d 847, 852 (7th Cir.\n1994) (affirming dismissal of claim for denial of access to courts where \"the facts known\nI  to [plaintiff] were sufficient to enable him to promptly file the instant lawsuit\").  Counts\nI  II and VII fail against the PBA because plaintiffs have not alleged any legally cognizable\ninjuries resulting from the actions of the PBA.\nI  2.  Plaintiffs' Counts IX, X And XI\nFail To Plead Injury\nI  Counts DC, X and XI also must fail against the PBA.  Count DC alleges a\nf  conspiracy to hinder equal protection under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). Plaintiffs contend that,\nin furtherance of this conspiracy, the PBA engaged in a number of acts intended to hinder\n'  the investigation into Louima's assault.  Compl. 1f 122. Count X alleges a conspiracy\namong defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2) \"to impede the due course of Justice [sic] in\nNew York State.\" Compl. 1125.  Count XI alleges that in violation of 42 U.S.C. §\n1985(2), the PBA's agents, including Immitt and Lee, attempted to intimidate and deter\ni  witnesses from testifying to federal authorities.  Compl-f131,132.\nInjury is a requisite element of both § 1985(2) and § 1985(3) claims.  See Chahal\nv. PaineWebber. 725 F.2d 20,23 (2nd Cir. 1984); Farrell v. Child Welfare Admin.. 77\nF.Supp.2d 329,332 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). However, here, to the extent plaintiffs seek redress\nfor acts designed to protect guilty officers from punishment, there is no pleading of injury\nto Louima.  Rather, \"a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the\nprosecution or non-prosecution of another.\"  Silverstem v. Barnes. 1986 WL 4545,\n(S.D.N.Y. 1986) affd. 798 F.2d 467 (2nd Cir. 1986) citing. Linda R.S. v. Richard P.. 410\nComplaint, can scarcely be imputed to the PBA under any theory of agency.\n20\n\nU.S. 614, 619 (1973). Thus, Louima lacks standing to assert claims arising from acts\nintended to make it difficult to bring his attackers to justice. Additionally, to the extent\nplaintiffs assert claims regarding threats made by Volpe for the purpose of silencing\nLouima (Compl. f 9), plaintiffs have not stated a claim against the PBA because they do\nnot allege that the PBA participated in making any such threats.\nD.  Counts XTV and XV Should Be Dismissed\nBecause Plaintiffs Fail To Allege That The\nPBA's Actions Proximatelv Caused Plaintiffs'  Injuries\nCounts XTV and XV of the Complaint purport to set forth a sprawling conspiracy\nbetween the City and the PBA covering at least twenty-five years of misconduct.  Compl.\nI  ff  148-177. A court's \"first inquiry in any case alleging municipal liability under § 1983\nI  is the question whether there is a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom\nand the alleged constitutional deprivation.\" Canton v. Harris. 489 U.S. 378,385 (1989);\nI  Gierlingerv.Gleason. 160 F.3d 858, 872 (2nd Cir. 1998) (holding that in all § 1983 cases\nI  \"plaintiff must prove that defendant's action was a proximate cause of plaintiffs injury\").\nPlaintiffs here do not attempt to relate the PBA's alleged wrongful practices to plaintiffs'\n•  injuries, instead relying on \"a litany of general conclusions that shock but have no\nI  meaning.\" Barr v. Abrams. 810 F.2d 358,363 (2nd Cir. 1987).\n.  Plaintiffs' allegations of proximate cause amount to little more than pleading that\nthe City has allowed an environment to develop in which police brutality is tolerated.\nI  That environment is alleged to have permitted, rather than caused the attack on Louima.\ni  However, New York Courts have found that merely creating circumstances that occasion\nan injury is insufficient to show proximate cause. See Sheehan v. City of New York. 40\nN.Y.2d 496,503,387 N.Y.S.2d 92,96 (N.Y. 1976) (holding that bus driver's violation of\n21\n\nI\n9  abuse resulting in severe injuries for the child.

Id at 299. In so holding, the Court stated that\na constitutional tort requires deprivation by the defendant,\nI\nand not merely a failure to protect the plaintiff from a\ndanger created by others. * * * [Deprivation in the\nconstitutional sense requires more than a minimal or\nI\nfictitious causal connection between the action of the state\nand the injury of the plaintiff.\nI  14302-303.\nHere, Louima fails to allege any direct causal link between acts committed by the\n\"  PBA and his injuries, instead relying on the identical theories of \"injury to the public at\nI  large\" rejected by the courts in Martinez and Deshanev.  For example, in paragraph 174\n_  of the Complaint, plaintiffs allege that \"as a direct and proximate result of the City's and\nPBA's policies and their deliberate indifference, defendants violated Mr. Louima's\nI  constitutional rights[.]\" Similarly, paragraph 177 alleges that \"[t]his conspiracy between\n•  the City and the PBA is ultimately responsible for, and the direct and proximate cause of\nthe violation of Abner Louima's rights[.]\" Plaintiffs' contentions against the PBA are\nI  utterly bereft of connection to the alleged assault in this case. Plaintiffs do not contend\nI  that the PBA encouraged, participated in, or set in motion the attack on Louima. Instead,\nplaintiffs merely allege in the most general terms that the acts of the PBA created an\nI  atmosphere in which the attack on plaintiff could take place. This pleading of\nI\nI\nI\n\n\"atmospheric causation\" is far removed from the pleading of a concrete chain of events\nthat proximately caused an injury to plaintiffs.7\nE.  Counts VIII, IX and X Should Be Dismissed For\nFailure To Allege That The PBA Acted With Racial Animus\nCounts VIII and IX plead the \"cover-up\" allegations as violations of 42 U.S.C. §\n1985(3), and Count X casts those same allegations as violative of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2).\nHowever, to state a claim for a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), or to state a claim of\nimpeding justice in state courts under § 1985(2), the plaintiff must allege that the\ndefendant acted with racial animus or with other class-based, invidiously discriminatory\nmotive. See Tilton v. Richardson. 6 F.3d 683,686 (10th Cir. 1993), citing Griffin v.\nBreckenridge. 403 U.S. 88, 101-02 (1971); Romero-Barcelo v.

Such allegations must be\npleaded with specificity. Waldron v. Rotzler. 862 F.

PLAINTIFFS' STATE LAW CLAIMS\nSHOULD BE DISMISSED\nA.  Count XVI Should Be Dismissed Because Plaintiffs Fail To Plead\nProximate Cause And Because The PBA Owes No Legal Duty to Plaintiffs\nCount XVI of the Complaint alleges negligence and gross negligence against the\nPBA, Lynch, Matarazzo and Immitt.  These claims require that plaintiffs allege a duty\nowed to them by the defendant and that the breach of that duty proximately caused the\ninjury.  See Hanlev v. East Moriches Union Free School Dist. II. 712 N.Y.S.2d 617 (2nd\nDep't 2000). Like Counts XTV and XV of the Complaint, Count XVI alleges that the\nPBA \"created an atmosphere\" that led to Louima's assault.  Compl. TJ184. As set forth in\nPoint I., D supra, these claims fail because the PBA's alleged acts are too remote from\nplaintiffs' injuries to establish proximate cause. Moreover, under the principles\ndelineated in Lizzi. the PBA is not responsible to members of the general public for the\ntorts of New York City police officers.\nPlaintiffs allege that the PBA, Lynch, Matarazzo and Immitt were negligent in\ntraining, supervising and monitoring those of its representatives who consult with and\ncounsel police officers suspected of criminal acts, or officers who witness criminal acts\nby other officers. Compl. 1179. According to the Complaint, the PBA and the Individual\nPBA Defendants have a duty to ensure that PBA members report crimes by other\nofficers, and the PBA and the Individual PBA Defendants have been negligent in the\ntraining they give to police officers in that regard.  Compl. ^ 180-81. Furthermore,\nplaintiffs allege that the PBA and the Individual PBA Defendants knew or should have\nknown that the PBA's  practices and policies have contributed to concealment of criminal\nacts by police officers and thus obstructed the investigations of officers.

The PBA and the Individual PBA Defendants allegedly helped create an atmosphere\nm  in which violent officers felt their criminal acts would not be investigated or prosecuted.\nCompl. 1184.\n|  Plaintiffs' negligence allegations parallel their \"systemic claim\" that the PBA\n•  created an atmosphere that made it easier for police brutality to flourish.  However,\nplaintiffs fail to link any of these activities to the circumstances surrounding Louima's\nI  injuries.  As demonstrated in the cases set forth above, proximate cause requires more\nI  than establishing that a defendant's actions \"occasioned\" the circumstances that led to an\ninjury.  See Sheehan. 40 N.Y.2d at 503; Heredia. 887 F. Supp. at 83. Proximate cause\nI  requires a direct link between the negligent action and the injury.  Salsedo v. Palmer. 278\nI  F. 92, 95 (2nd Cir. 1921). Plaintiffs have not pleaded that link here and consequently\nCount XVI should be dismissed.\nI  A.  Count XIX for Infliction of\nEmotional Distress Should Be Dismissed\n>  Plaintiffs' Count XIX for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the\nj  PBA, Immitt and Lee fails because it is time-barred and because it is actually a claim for\ni\ndefamation, artfully pleaded as a claim for infliction of emotional distress.\n1.  Plaintiffs'Count XIX for Intentional and Negligent\nInfliction of Emotional Distress Is Actually An\nInadequately Pleaded Defamation Claim\nCount XIX fails to state a claim for infliction of emotional distress and must be\ndismissed.  Plaintiffs allege that the PBA, Immitt, and Lee caused emotional distress to\nLouima by preventing the exposure of Louima's assault.  Compl. 1 205. Plaintiffs allege\nthat the PBA caused emotional distress by spreading a false rumor that Louima had\n27\n\nI\nincurred his injuries through consensual sexual activity.  Compl. 1206.  As a result,\n| plaintiffs contend, Louima endured \"humiliation and ridicule.\" Compl. Tf 206.\nPlaintiffs' claim that Louima was emotionally upset as the result of the PBA's\nI  efforts to conceal his assault, fails to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional\n|  distress.  In order to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a\nplaintiff must allege extreme or outrageous conduct, intent to cause severe emotional\nI  distress, a causal connection between the conduct and plaintiffs injury, and severe\nI  emotional distress. £ee Treelia v. Town of Manlius. 68 F. Supp.2d 153,160 (N.D.N.Y.\n1999).  Here, under plaintiffs' own theory, the alleged conduct was taken to protect the\n™  defendants rather than distress the plaintiff.  Thus, plaintiffs' have not alleged intent\nI  against the PBA.\nThe second basis of plaintiffs' claim for infliction of emotional distress is the\n™  spreading of a false rumor to cause Louima humiliation and ridicule.  Compl. ^ 206. The\nI  making of a false statement to expose someone to \"public contempt, ridicule, aversion or\ndisgrace\" creates a cause of action for libel or defamation.  Plataniotis v.

However, plaintiffs nowhere plead the particulars of when the statement was\n.  made, by whom, to whom, or exactly what was said.  All these particulars must be set\nforth in a defamation claim.

Moreover, a cause of action for intentional infliction\nI  of emotional distress must be dismissed where \"it falls in the ambit of other traditional\nI  tort liability,\" such as defamation.  Herlihv v. Metropolitan Museum of Art. 214 A.D.2d\n250,263, 633 N.Y.S.2d 106 (1st Dep't 1995). Because plaintiffs' cause of action for\n'  infliction of emotional distress is actually an inadequately pleaded cause of action for\nI  defamation, it must be dismissed.\n2.  Count XIX Is Time-Barred\n'  Count XIX is time-barred and must be dismissed.  Defamation and intentional\nI  infliction of emotional distress each have a one-year statute of limitations in New York.\n.  See CPLR § 215(3) (one-year statute of limitations for defamation); Montefusco v.\nNassau County. 3 9 F. Supp.2d 231,23 8 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (one year statute of limitations\nI  for intentional inflection of emotional distress); Campbell v. Gravline Air Shuttle. Inc..\nI  930 F. Supp. 794, 803 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (same). Plaintiffs do not allege when the false\nrumor was spread by defendants.  Yet allegations of spreading false rumors about Louima\n(  were not raised by plaintiffs against the PB A until service of the Second Amended\nI  Complaint, dated June 27,2000.\nNo direct or indirect allegation of emotional distress was alleged in the original\nI  complaint or the First Amended Complaint against the PBA. Thus, Plaintiffs waited\n29\n\nmore than two and a half years after August 9, 1997 before pleading for the first time the\nPBA's responsibility for the rumor.9\nThis belated pleading of PBA involvement in spreading false rumors about\nLouima is invalidated by the one-year limitations period applying to defamation and\nintentional infliction alike. Accordingly, Count XIX of the Complaint should be\ndismissed.\nin.  MICHELINE LOUIMA'S CLAIMS FAIL\nBECAUSE THEY ARE DERIVATIVE\nOF ABNER LOUIMA'S CLAIMS\nCount XXV of the Complaint is a derivative claim brought by Micheline Louima\nbased on the injuries suffered by her husband.  Because the PBA has no legal duty to\nLouima, did not proximately cause any of his injuries and is not responsible for the\ndeprivation of any of  Louima's rights, this claim must be dismissed against the PBA and\nthe Individual PBA Defendants.\nIV.  THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL\nPBA DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE DISMISSED\nEven given the liberal pleading standards of Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), plaintiffs\nhave wholly failed to allege a claim against  Lynch and Matarazzo.  The sole factual\nallegation in the Complaint against Matarazzo is that \"in his official capacity, [he] was at\nrelevant times, the President of the PBA.\" Compl. f 27. The only allegation against\nLynch is that \"in his official capacity, [he] is the current President of the PBA.\" Compl. ^f\nCount XK does not relate back, for statute of limitations purposes, to the filing date of the\noriginal complaint because the alleged facts on which the count is based do not arise out of the same\nconduct, transaction or occurrence originally pleaded against the PBA. Ss£ Fe(^ R- Civ. P., 15(c)(2);\nMackensworth v. S.S. American Merchant 28 F.3d 246, 251-52 (2pd Cir. 1994). Also, under Barrow v.\nWethersfield Police Dept. 66 F.3d 466,468-70 (2nd Cir. 1995), as modified. 74 F.3d 1366 (2nd Cir. 1996),\nplaintiffs may not belatedly add new defendants on a claim merely because plaintiffs did not identify the\nnew defendants in a timely fashion.\n30\n\nI\nI  28. Plaintiffs do not set forth what acts Lynch and Matarazzo are alleged to have\nk  committed that would give rise to liability.  Lynch and Matarazzo are named only in\n;  Count XVI of the Complaint, plaintiffs' negligence claim.  Because the PBA does not\nI  owe a duty to plaintiffs, its president acting in his official capacity owes no greater duty.\n|  See point II, A supra.10  Accordingly, the Complaint should be dismissed as against\nMatarazzo and Lynch.\nI  For their part, Immitt and Lee are alleged to have played a role in the so-called\nI  cover up. Compl. f 71-86. Immitt is alleged to have attended the August 13 meeting in\nthe basement of the 70th Precinct.  Compl. f 72. Plaintiffs do not allege what specific\nI  actions Immitt engaged in during that meeting.  Thereafter, Immitt is alleged to have\nI  appeared at roll calls for the 70th Precinct in an effort to urge officers to remain silent in\nresponse to the investigator's inquiries.  Compl. If 75. In conclusory fashion, plaintiffs\n1  allege that Immitt and Lee sought to deter individual officers from coming forward, to\nI  intimidate any officers who did come forward and to publicize to the perpetrators and\nother police officers the names of individuals thought to be cooperating with the\n-  investigation.  Compl. Tf 76. Immitt is later alleged to have invoked a privilege\nI  concerning communications with union members.  Compl. 1(77.\nPlaintiffs' claims against Immitt and Lee should be dismissed for the reasons set\nforth in Points I through HI above. Because plaintiffs did not suffer any injury\nI  cognizable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 et. seq., Counts n, VII, VIE, DC, X and XI should be\n•  dismissed against Immitt and Lee. (See Point I. C, supra). Additionally, plaintiffs do not\nallege racial animus against either Immitt or Lee.  Consequently, Counts VET, DC and X\nI\n10  Additionally, Lynch's negligence could not have caused Louima's injuries because Lynch only\n•  became President of the PBA on July 1,1999, almost two years after the assault on Louima.\nI\n\nshould be dismissed.  (See Point I. E, suprai  Because the § 1985 claims fail against\n|  Immitt and Lee, the § 1986 claim must be dismissed.  (See Point I. F, supra).  Finally,\nplaintiffs' state law claims in Counts XVI and Count XIX and Micheline Louima's\nderivative claim in count XXV fail against Immitt and Lee for the reasons set forth in\ng  Points II and III, supra.\nj  CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the PBA, Lynch, Matarazzo, Immitt and Lee\nrespectfully request that the Complaint be dismissed with prejudice.\nLAW OFFICES OF THOMAS P.

Both\nthe general practices and the specific acts of perjury, subornation, and intimidation set out in the\ncomplaint, the PBA assures the Court, are \"necessary\" incidents of its role as collective\nbargaining agent for its police officer members. W. at 11. As will be demonstrated below, these\nassertions are no less an affront to settled principles of civil rights law than they are to common\nsense and common decency.\nAs will also become clear, the facts alleged in the complaint -  which, consistently with\nthe notice pleading contemplated by Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), constitute only a small selection of\nwhat emerged in the course of three criminal trials ~ have not been presented in order to\n\"'shock,'\" Memorandum at 21 (quoting Barr v. Abrams. 810 F.2d 358, 363 (2nd Cir. 1987))\n(though it is hard to present them in a way that might not provoke that reaction).  Rather, they\n'The PBA seeks dismissal of all claims against the union, its past and present presidents, and\nindividual defendants Immitt and Lee (defendants Abbate and Wiese, though sued, in part, based on\ntheir actions on behalf of the PBA are not signatories to the motion, nor does the motion address\nclaims against \"William Woe\" defendants). Except where specifically indicated, this Memorandum\nwill refer to the movants - union and individual -  as \"the PBA.\"\n1\n\nhave been set out so as to demonstrate the patent illegality of Defendants' conduct and Mr.\nLouima's plain entitlement to redress from the PBA for its central, culpable role in the\nconstitutional deprivations to which he has been subjected.\nAt the outset, the PBA's Motion fails to clear even the lowest hurdle confronting a\ndefendant seeking dismissal of a federal complaint: it does not attempt to demonstrate that the\nfactual allegations of the Complaint do not state a claim.  Rather then accept as true -  as any\nRule 12(b)(6) movant must, see, e.g.. King v. Simpson. 189 F.3d 284 (2nd Cir.  1999) -  the\nallegations in Mr. Louima's civil rights complaint, the PBA seeks to respond to a different and\ntellingly incomplete set of \"facts.\"  Thus, where the complaint alleges that defendant Schwarz\n\"helped restrain Louima while Volpe took a stick and shoved it into Mr. Louima's rectum,\"  %.\nthat \"Schwarz and Volpe administered summary punishment,\" ^42, and that \"Schwarz,\nattempting to silence Mr. Louima's cries of pain, placed his booted foot on Mr. Louima's face/'\n*44. the PBA characterizes the complaint as alleging a \"real... injury stemming from an act\ncommitted by a police officer,\" Memorandum at 1 (emphasis supplied); id. at 3 (\"Louima was\nassaulted and sodomozied by defendant Justin Volpe\"), and insists that Mr. Louima \"departs\nfrom the realm of reality\" in asserting that the actions described were not those of \"one depraved\nindividual.\" Memorandum at 12 (emphasis supplied).  And  where the complaint states that Mr.\nLouima \"was beaten severely bv Schwarz and Wiese about the face and body,\" ^[37 (emphasis\nsupplied), the Memorandum offers a carefully abbreviated summary of that paragraph,\ncharacterizing it as alleging that \"Louima was beaten.\"  Id. at 3.2\n2Nor does this exhaust the evidence of Defendants' obtuse approach toward the contents of\nthe complaint. Their \"statement of facts\" -  offered in support of an argument that the complaint's\nallegations are insufficient contains other indications that relevance to Mr. Louima's claims against\n\nBut mere inconsistency with conventions of federal pleading is not the most troubling\naspect of the PBA's submission.  What makes the Memorandum especially unsettling is that the\nfacts the PBA takes pains to ignore are ones that have already been established, bv proof beyond\na reasonable doubt, in the course of three criminal trials, see, e.g.. United States v. Bruder. 103 F.\nSupp. 155,177 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (\"[t]he jury found that Schwarz helped Volpe to sodomize\nLouima with the admitted purpose of humiliating him\") -  and that the omissions come in a\nthem was a criterion for exclusion from Defendants'  summary.\nAmong the allegations the PBA would have the Court ignore for purposes of deciding its\nmotion are that defendant Wiese was \"at all relevant times.. .an agent of the PBA. acting under its\ndirectives,\" ^|26.d; \"that one or more of these PBA agents invoked their 5th Amendment right against\nself incrimination\" in testifying before matters at issue here fl[77); that Defendant Immitt \"testified\nfalsely,\" (^78); the basement meeting was convened by \"defendant Wiese, in his capacity as PBA\ndelegate\"( f72); see also ^83 c;  and the discussion of \"ways to intimidate Louima\" was not confined\nto \"the officers,\" Memorandum at 5, but rather is believed to have included the \"participants\" (f72),\nincluding Immitt; the PBA maintains \"policies, customs and practices of suppressing confessions\nand admissions of criminal conduct committed by police officers, of discouraging police  officer\nwitnesses from doing their duty, and of condoning and facilitating false statements to investigators\"\n(1)79); there were \"scores of phone calls between and among the officers  involved and the PBA\nagents\"  (1f83.d);  the  PBA  \"intimidat[ed]  and  defamfed]  those  individuals  who  did  answer\ninvestigators' questions fl[94.d); the PBA \"circulated] false and defamatory information concerning\nMr. Louima, in an effort to discourage him from telling authorities and courts the truth about what\nwas done to him and to diminish the credibility of any information and testimony he did give\" (1J95.\ne); the \"PBA, through its agents, continues to deter and discourage police officer witnesses from\ntestifying truthfully in federal court\" (11132); \"PBA and other unions 'put[] immense pressure on the\nguiltless officer - who may want to answer questions - not to stray from the common practice of\nabiding by union advice and remaining silent'; that 'PBA delegates and attorneys help reinforce the\ncode of silence,' and that 'the PBA often acts as a shelter and protector of the corrupt cop, rather than\nas a guardian of the interests of the vast majority of its membership, who are honest police officers.'\"\n(1(164) (quoting Mollen Commission); and \"it has been [the PBA's] standard operating procedure\nto abet and orchestrate the obstruction of justice in even the most notorious instances of police\nmisconduct,\"Cfll 70) - including in the notorious police killing of Anthony Baez fl[ 171) and others.\nSee generally 1J173 (\"It is the custom and practice of the PBA to treat those officers who want to\ncome forward -  and not those who violently  abuse citizens -  as wrongdoers\"); compare also\nMemorandum at 18 (asserting that respondeat superior principles are inapplicable to § 1985 claim\nhere because \"plaintiffs seek[] only money damages from the PBA\" with complaint at 55 (plaintiffs\nrequest that the Court award \"equitable relief against the PBA\").\n\npleading responding to a complaint seeking to hold the PBA accountable for. among other things,\na continuing effort to suppress the true facts concerning Mr. Louima's torture.  See Iffil 12. 135,\n141. Nor is it plausibly a coincidence that the facts which the PBA cannot bring itself to accept\neven for pleading purposes are the very same ones that the several of the individual defendants\nhave been sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment for having denied.3\nBut while disregard for this basic 12(b)(6) requirement is probably the most jarring of the\ndefects in Defendants' pleading - and should suffice in itself to defeat their demand for dismissal\n-  the Memorandum's unreliability does not stop with its factual recitation.  Whatever surface\nplausibility the PBA's various assertions concerning causation, legal duty, and state action might\nhave is obtained by distorting - or simply ignoring - applicable decisions of the Supreme Court\nand the Second Circuit, by attacking straw-man legal theories the PBA mistakenly ascribes to\nMr. Louima's complaint, and by diverting attention to legal principles that have scant relevance\nto this case.\nThus, for example, the Memorandum labors to show that the PBA is not a \"governmental\nentity\" -  a fact that is not in dispute - but nowhere reckons with the established princinrte thata~\"~\"\nnon-governmental actor may be held fully accountable under Section 1983 on proof tjiiat it was a\n\"wilful joint participant\" -  as the PBA surely stands accused of having been  -  in government\naction depriving an individual of his federal rights, Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co.. 398 U.S. 144,\n3As the complaint illustrates, saying that Mr. Louima's charges \"depart from reality\" is a\nfamiliar tactic in Defendants' arsenal - and those words are by no means the harshest ones they have\ndirected at Mr. Louima.  For purposes of a motion to dismiss - and beyond, sge. Emich Motors v.\nGeneral Motors. 340 U.S. 558, 568-69(1951) -  prudence suggests that the Court proceed on the\nassumption that, in instances of conflict, the verdicts of juries convinced unanimously  beyond\nreasonable doubt are a more reliable indicator of \"reality\" than is whatever version of the events of\n1997 that the PBA may now be advancing.\n\n152 n. 7 (1970); Dvvares v. Citv of New York. 985 F.2d 94, 98 (2nd Cir. 1993 ): see also Hushes\nv- PBA. 854 F.2d 876, 880-81 (2nd Cir. 1988).  And the PBA discusses at some length (though\nnot correctly) the common law rule that proximate causation requires more than \"furnishing a\ncondition\" that permits a tort to occur, see Memorandum at 21-22, without even bare\nlowledgment of the abundant case law specifically teaching that, for Section 1983 purposes,\na policy of deliberate indifference to preventable and plainly foreseeable constitutional\ndeprivations can establish the necessary link.  See, e.g.. Fiacco v. Citv of Rensselaer. 783 F.2d\n319. 326 (2nd Cir. 1986) (explicitly rejecting \"suggestion that a municipal policy that... merely\npermits or tolerates unconstitutional acts by city employees cannot be the basis for ...  liability\nunder § 1983\").  And the PBA cites a patchwork assortment of state law tort cases as supporting\nits assertion that labor unions must be treated differently  from other private wrongdoers under\nsection 1983, see Memorandum at 16, when, in fact, the case law makes clear that they, no less\nthan other private actors, are subject to the legal obligation, imposed by section 1983, to refrain\nfrom participation in unconstitutional state action.  See, e.g.. Andrews v. Education Ass'n of\nCheshire. 829 F.2d 335 (2d. Cir. 1987).\nFinally, the PBA would have the Court dismiss Mr. Louima's case on the specious\nground (a) that his complaint seeks to hold the PBA liable simply because those who brutally\nattacked him under color of law happened to be union members or (b) that it treats the mere fact\nof their municipal employment as sufficient to render union officials state actors.  In so arguing,\nDefendants are simply striking out at arguments of their own imagining.  Any fair reading of the\ncomplaint -  let alone the indulgent one contemplated by Federal Rule 12(b)(6) -  makes clear\nthat no such rule of automatic liability is asked for, nor is one needed to hold the PBA and its\n\nagents responsible for the consequences of the union's active, willing involvement in a deeply-\ningrained municipal custom of protecting police officers from criminal and civil rights liability\nfor violent deprivations of innocent citizens' constitutional rights.\nI. Controlling Principles\nA. Substantive Law\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides that:\nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation., custom, or\nusage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of\nthe United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation\nof any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall\nbe liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper\nproceeding for redress....\nIt is axiomatic that section 1983 does not create substantive rights beyond those protected\nby the Constitution and laws of the United States.  Its purpose is to provide a remedy to those\nwho (1) are deprived of rights (2) under color of law.  See Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff. 63\nF.3d 110 (2nd Cir. 1995).\nIn Monroe v. Pape. 365 U.S. 167, 172-83 (1961), the Supreme Court held that the \"color\nof law\" requirement does not limit § 1983 liability to defendants whose actions are authorized by\nlaw. and the Supreme Court's decisions have made equally clear that whether particular conduct\nwas under color of law fact cannot be settled by the fact that the defendant is or is not an officer\nof the state.  See Adickes. 398 U.S. 144 (1970); Terrv v. Adams. 345 U.S. 461 (1953).\nAdickes specifically recognized that when a private person acts pursuant to a State law, policy or\ncustom -  Le. a \"practice[]... so permanent and well settled\" as to have the force of law, 398\nU.S. at 167-68 -  he acts under color of law.\n\nAdickes also established that\n[pjrivate persons, jointly engaged with state officials in the prohibited action are acting\n\"under color of law for purposes of [Section 1983].\" To act 'under color' of stale law\ndoes not require that the accused be an officer of the State.  It is enough that he is a wilful\nparticipant in joint activity.\n398 U.S. at 152 (quoting United States v. Price. 383 U.S. 787, 797 (1966)).  And other decisions\nhave made clear that the actions of individuals who are not officers of the state may also give rise\nto § 1983 liability when the individual \"exercised power 'possessed by virtue of state law and\nmade possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.\"' \\Vest_v.\nAtkins. 487 U.S. 42, 49 (1988) (quoting United States v. Classic. 313 U.S. 299. 326 (1941)); see\nalso Lugar v Edmondson Oil Co.. Inc.. 457 U.S. 922 (1982^: see generally Anava v. Crossroads\nManaged Care Svs.. 195 F.3d 584, 596  (10th Cir. 1999) (\"If any one of the tests indicates a party\nis a state actor, that alone is sufficient to find the party a state actor\"); Lugar. 457 U.S. at 939\n(whether a party acts under color of law is a \"necessarily fact-bound inquiry\").\nIn Monell v. New York Citv Department of Social Servs.. 436 U.S. 658 (1978), the\nSupreme Court, after canvassing the legislative history of the 1871 Act, overruled prior precedent\nand held that municipalities may be sued under section 1983 based on the unconstitutional acts of\ntheir employees and agents.  Such suits, the Court held, however, may not proceed based on a\ntheory of respondeat superior.  Instead, the plaintiff must show that the municipal defendant was\nitselfa^participant in the deprivation, byshowing that the challenged actions\nhe result of ajnpn^rffll  policy or custom.\nThe Court has also affirmed what the disjunctive language of § 1983 would suggest: that\na defendant's responsibility under § 1983 does not depend on a plaintiffs proving the existence\n\nof a formal municipal policy condoning unconstitutional conduct.  See Monell. 436 U.S. at 691\n(municipality must answer in § 1983 for actions pursuant to a \"governmental custom even\nthough such custom has not received formal approval\");  Adickes. 39S U.S. at 168; Vann v. City\nof New York 72 F.3d 1040,1049 (2nd Cir. 1995).  Indeed, defendants may be held liable based\non customs that directly contradict their official pronouncements of governmental policy.  See,\ne.g.. City of St. Louis v. Prapotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 131 (1985) (existence of anti-discrimination\npolicy would not immunize municipality against liability for discriminationi: White-Ruiz v. Citv\nof New York. 983 F. Supp. 365, 392 & n.19 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); see generally Myriam E. Gilles.\nBreaking The Code of Slence: Rediscovering \"Custom\" in Section 1983. 80 B.U. L. REV. 17\n(2000).\nWhile a defendant's negligence will not give rise to liability under § 1983, proof of\ndeliberate indifference to a foreseeable constitutional violation will suffice to establish legal\nresponsibility.  Citv of Canton v. Harris. 489 U.S. 378, 388 (19891: see also Dodd v. Citv of\n\"Norwich. 827 F.2d 1, 5 (2nd Cir. 1987)(discussing requirement that plaintiff link challenged\npolicy to injury): see Gentile v. Suffolk County. 926 F.2d 142, 152-53 (2nd Cir. 1991) (same);\nJen v. Dallas Ind. Sch. Dist.. 491 U.S. 701, 737 (1989) (\"it is for the jury to determine whether\nthe deprivation of rights at issue ...  [was caused by] acquiescence in a long-standing practice or\ncustom which constitutes the 'standard operating procedure' of the local government entity\").\nFinally, while the legal standards governing the types of cases are not precisely identical,\ncourts have established that the same factors - proof of (1) custom or policy and (2) deliberate\nindifference - are the touchstones for deciding when a government employee's supervisor or a\nprivate defendant may be held accountable under the statute for the unconstitutional conduct of\n8\n\nan employee, see Memorandum at 17 (citing Austin v. Paramount Parks. Inc.. 195 F.3d 715 (4\"'\nCir. 1999) (private defendant); Spencer v. Doe. 139 F.3d 107, 112 (2nd Cir. 1998) (supervisor);\ncf. Doe v. Taylor Ind. Sch. Dist.. 15 F.3d 1443, 1453 (5th Cir.) (en bane) \"[t]he legal elements of\nan individual's supervisory liability and a political subdivision's liability, however, are similar\nenough that the same standards of fault and causation should govern\").\nAlthough private defendants who conspire with state officers to take unconstitutional\naction may be held accountable for the harm that action causes, section 1983 does not provide a\ndistinct cause of action based on inchoate unconstitutional action, see Hampton v. Hanrahan. 600\nF.2d 600, 622 (7th Cir. 1979) (\"mere proof of a conspiracy is insufficient to establish a section\n1983 claim\"),  rev'd with respect to attorney's fees. 446 U.S. 754 (1980).  Rather, proof of such\nconcerted action can establish that a challenged deprivation of rights was under the \"color of\nlaw,\" and § 1983 conspiracy liability is a subset of the broader principle - familiar in civil law  -\nthat an individual may be held to answer for the harm caused by wrongful conduct in which he\nwas a wilful participant.  See id. at 627  (liability for \"joint action\" and \"conspiracy\" both derive\nfrom the rule that \"when persons 'who, in pursuance of a common plan or design to commit a\ntortious act, actively take part in it, or further it by cooperation or request, or who lend aid or\nencouragement to the wrongdoer, or ratify and adopt his acts done for their benefit are equally\nliable with him'\") (quoting W. PROSSER, TORTS (4th ed. 1971) at 292).  Thus, proof of\nconspiracy is\"[o]ne way to establish joint action.\" Collins v. Womancare. 878 F.2d 1145, 1154\n(9lh Cir. 1989) -  it is not a mandatory prerequisite to liability. Accord Lugar,  457 U.S. at 943 n*\n(Burger, C.J., dissenting) (noting that Court had found private actor liable under joint\nparticipation theory without any \"allegation of collusion or conspiracy with state actors\")-\n\nMoreover, even in cases where § 1983 liability is premised exclusively on conspiracy\nallegations, there is no need to prove that there was an overt agreement, see LeBlanc-Sternbera v.\nFletcher. 67 F.3d 412, 427 (2nd Cir. 1995) (\"tacit understanding\" suffices), nor need the\nagreement's existence be proved through direct evidence, see Hampton. 600 F.2d at 627;\nAdickes. 398 U.S. at 155 (reversing summary judgment notwithstanding plaintiffs conceded\nlack of knowledge \"of any communication between [the allegedly conspiring parties]\"), nor need\nthe plaintiff show that the various participants \"agreed on the details of the conspiratorial scheme\nor even know who the other conspirators are\" so long as they \"understood] the general\nobjectives of the scheme, acceptfed] them, and agreefd], either explicitly or implicitly, to do\n[their] part to further them,\" Jones v. City of Chicago. 856 F.2d 985, 992 (7th Cir. 1988). Rather,\nthe cases make clear that existence of an  \"understanding\" suffices - one which may be inferred\nfrom the \"sequence of events,\" Adickes. 398 U.S. at 157; see also Kunik v. Racine County. 946\nF.2d 1574, 1580 (7th Cir. 1991) (\"the agreement need not be overt, but if not, the acts alleged\nmust be sufficient to raise an inference of mutual understanding\"); Hampton. 600 F.2d at 627\n(holding that § 1983 conspiracy liability can be based on defendant's lending \"'aid or\nencouragement to the wrongdoer, or ratifying] and adoptfing] his acts'\") (quoting W. PROSSER,\nsupra): Pangbum v. Culbertson. 200 F.3d 65, 72 (2nd Cir. 1999) (noting that \"[§ 1983\nconspiracies are by their very nature secretive operations, and may have to be proven by\ncircumstantial, rather than direct, evidence\") (internal quotation omitted).4\n4\"The question whether an agreement exists should not be taken from the jury in a civil\nconspiracy case so long as there is a possibility that the jury can 'infer from the circumstances that\nthe alleged conspirators . . . reached an understanding' to achieve the conspiracy's objectives.\"\nHampton. 600 F.2d at 621 (quoting Adickes. 398 U.S. at 158-59); cf.

R. Civ. P. 8(a).\nand because the complaint necessarily is filed without the benefit of discovery', a court evaluating\na Rule 12(b)(6) motion must accept as true the allegations of the complaint and afford the\nplaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences from those factual allegations.

See 460 U.S. at 337 n. 18 (citing\nCong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess.  152,158,173,201,320-321,322,340,437,439,443-444,457,\n458. 503, 516, 518, 653, 654, 687 (1871)).\n6In Briscoe. the Court ultimately held that § 1983 did not abrogate traditional absolute\nimmunity from civil liability based on perjured statements presented by witnesses in criminal trials.\nIn explaining this holding (which it expressly limited to in-court testimony offered at trial), the Court\nstressed that the congressional deliberations had been concerned virtually exclusively with the\nproblem of false exculpatory testimony - not the use of perjured testimony to wrongfully convict -\nand noted the importance of another provision of the same statute, now codified at § 1985, in\ncombating conspiracies to commit perjury.

With narrow exceptions (for example, matters subject to judicial notice), see, e.g..\nSamuels v. Air Transp. Local 504.. 992 F.2d 12,15 (2nd Cir. 1993), the court may not consider\nmatters outside the complaint's four corners, and the defendant may not contest the truth of any\nof the allegations.  See Ricciuti v. New York Citv Trans.

Ricciuti. 941 F.2d at 123 (Rule 8(a)(2) \"is designed to permit the\ndefendant to have a fair understanding of what the plaintiff is complaining about and to know\nwhether there is a legal basis for recovery\").  To insist upon greater factual specificity for\nparticular categories of claims or complaints is incompatible with the purpose and plain meaning\nof Federal Rules 8 and 9, which enumerate expressly (and exhaustively) the matters that must be\npleaded with particularity, see Leatherman v. Tarrant County. 507 U.S. 163 (1993)  -  and with\nCircuit precedent, which instructs that civil rights complaints be liberally construed.  See\ngenerally Conlev v.

The PBA Is Legally Responsible For Its Role in Denying Mr. Louima's Federal Civil\nRights\nA. The Complaint States a Claim Under Section 1983\nAlthough there can be no serious disagreement that Mr. Louima has pleaded - and\nsuffered - deprivations of his federal civil rights, see Memorandum at 1.3: see also Bruder. 103\nF. Supp. 2d at 178 (jury necessarily found that actions were \"under color of law\"), the PBA\ninsists that neither its active role in creating, maintaining and fostering a code of silence nor its\nenergetic use of intimidation and perjury in Mr. Louima's case could give rise to § 1983 liability.\nAccording to Defendants, even when it is accepted that: (1) knowledge that the PBA can be\nrelied upon to thwart investigations emboldens violent police officers who commit acts of\ncriminal brutality and (2) the willingness of the PBA to resort to lies and intimidation in fact (a)\nprevents the truth from surfacing in such cases; and (b) prevents honestly inclined police officers\nfrom carrying out their duty and from coming to the aid of innocent civilians who are under\npolice attack or in need of medical attention; anchhat (3) the PBA, knowing that Mr. Louima had\nin fact been beaten and sexually brutalized and remained handcuffed to his hospital bed as a\nprisoner, spent its energies devising, in conjunction with his tormentors, a campaign aimed at\npublicly humiliating him and derailing his efforts to seek redress, such involvement would be too\n\"attenuated\" to give rise to a civil rights claim. Although the Memorandum attempts to support\n'Although some Second Circuit decisions have been read as imposing a heightened pleading\nstandard in certain classes of § 1983 cases, see Dwares. those requirements, as several recent\ndecisions have recognized, do not survive the Supreme Court's decision in Leatherman. SeePisello.\n931 F. Supp. at 210.\n14\n\nthese counterintuitive assertions with (sometimes) plausible-sounding arguments concerning ihe\nelements of Section 1983 liability - and with wholly implausible efforts to disparage the\ncomplaint's hundreds of factual allegations as \"bare\" and nonspecific - the obstacles to recovery\nthat the PBA would have the Court insert into the statute is entirely irreconcilable with governing\nlaw.\n1.  The PBA May Be Held Jointly Liable Under Section 1983 Based On Its Role\nin Depriving Mr. Louima of His Rights\nAt the outset, to the extent that the Memorandum's assertion that section 1983\nresponsibility for the injuries to Mr. Louima \"lie[s] with the City, the police department, and the\nindividual officer [sic] \" id at 3, is meant to suggest that these actors' liability would somehow\nforeclose holding the PBA accountable, it plainly misapprehends the law.  Responsibility under §\n1983 is not an either/or proposition, whereby a court must decide whether one entity or another is\nthe wrongdoer.  It is not at all uncommon for a plaintiff to have viable section 1983 claims\nagainst multiple defendants, see Lusbv v. T.G. & Y Stores. Inc.. 749 F.2d 1423 (10th Cir. 1984)\n(upholding liability against private actor and municipality who acted in concert), cert, granted\nand vacated on other grounds sub nom. City of Lawton v. Lusbv. 474 U.S. 805 (19851 aff d on\nreconsideration. 796 F.2d 1307 (10th Cir. 1986); Fiacco.783 F.2d 319 (upholding liability against\nboth municipality and individual officers): cf. Dennis v. Sparks. 449 U.S. 24 (1980) (affirming\nthat private individual who conspired with state actor may be liable, notwithstanding latter's\nentitlement to absolute immunity). Indeed,  such joint liability is an inescapable consequence of\ndecisions affirming that municipalities, see Monell. supervisors, see Wright v. Smith. 21 F.3d\n496, 502 (2nd Cir. 1994), private actors, Adickes. and co-conspirators, id, can be held\n15\n\nresponsible for government employees' unconstitutional actions. Here, in light of the nature of\nhis allegations, the fact that Mr. Louima has such strong § 1983 claims against individual officers\nand the City can only strengthen - and obviously does not extinguish - his claim against the\nPBA. Cf Citv of Los Angeles v. Heller. 475 U.S. 796 (1986) (per curianV) (failure to prove case\nagainst individual defendant may, under certain circumstances, limit municipal liability).\n2. The Complaint Alleges PBA Involvement Under \"Color of Law\"\nA centerpiece of the?Defendants' Memorandum is that the PBA actions described in the\ncomplaint - which include (1) joining with the City to create a custom whereby officers\" silence\nregarding unsolved crimes ofviolence against civilians goes unpunished and honesty concerning\nbrutal civil rights violations is vilified and; (2) using unique powers delegated by the City to\npromote cover-ups of violent criminal acts to and punish those who do not hew to the\nconspiratorial plan; and (3) acting affirmatively, in conjunction with police officers, to harm Mr.\nLouima and impede his ability to obtain full redress - could not have been taken under  \"color of\nlaw.\"\nAlthough that assertion has a surface plausibility - if only because the PBA is not a\ngovernmental entity, but see infra — it does not survive collision with decades of Supreme Court\nprecedent settling that \"to act 'under color' of state law does not require that the accused be an\nofficer of the State,\" Adickes. 398 U.S. at 152, and delineating the circumstances supporting\nprivate party liability under § 1983. As noted above, the Adickes decision held the \"color of\nlaw'\" requirement satisfied either when a private party is shown to be a \"wilful participant in_\njoint action\" violative of the Constitution, 398 U.S. at 152, or when that party acts unilaterally.\nbut pursuant to an unconstitutional government-enforced custom, id at 171, and other decisions\n16\n\nhave affirmed the availability of a § 1983 remedy when the misconduct of a private actor is made\npossible \"because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.\" Kern v. Citv of\nRochester. 93 F.3d 38,43 (2nd Cir. 1996) (citations omitted), or where the \"the injury caused is\naggravated in a unique way by the incidents of governmental authority.\"' Edmonson v. Leesville\nConcrete Co. Inc.. 500 U.S. 614, 621 (1991).  Mr. Louima's complaint states § 1983 claims\nagainst the PBA on each of these theories.  See generally Anava. 195 F.3d at 596 (\"If any one of\nthe tests indicates a party is a state actor, that alone is sufficient to find the party a state actor\").\na.  Section 1983 Liability Does Not Depend On Proof That The PBA Is a\nGovernmental  Entity\nThe PBA begins with a desultory argument that the \"color of law\" determination here is\ncontrolled by a quarter-century old decision of the Southern District. Wright v. PBA. 1975 WL\n215 (S.D.N.Y. July 23,1975).  Because the court in that case held that the PBA would not liable\nas a \"state actor,\" the PBA suggests, the same outcome must obtain here.  See Memorandum at\n10; see also id. at 9 (citing Williams v. Citv of New York Dep't of Corrections. 1998 WL\n160988, *2 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 1998) for the proposition that a § 1983 \"plaintiff must allege\nfacts that would establish that a governmental entity deprived her of a right secured bv law\"\n(emphasis supplied)).  This line of argument amounts to little more than wishful thinking on\nDefendants\" part.8\n8 The case cited by the PBA, Williams, in no way considered the circumstances under which\na non-governmental entity may be held to act \"under color of law.\" Indeed, there was no dispute in\nthat case that the defendant, the City Corrections Department was a state actor; the dispositive issue\nconcerned whether plaintiff had alleged the deprivation of a federal right, and the Court mled that\nshe had not. As explained below, the general rule Defendants seem to cite Williams as announcing\nis neither correct -  it conflicts both with venerable Supreme Court authority holding that private\nentities can act under color of law and with the recognition, on the same page of the Memorandum,\nthat § 1983 liability may be imposed either on persons \"who either are state actors or are acting under\n17\n\nHowever the issue was resolved on the facts of the Wright case, the proper question for §\n1983 purposes is not whether a private entity such as the PBA is or is not a \"state actor.\" but\nrather whether the particular practices and actions giving rise to the complaint were taken \"under\ncolor of law.\"  There is no contention in this case that the PBA is a governmental entity. Le.. one\nwhose every act is presumptively \"under color of law,\" Lugar. 457 U.S. at 935. and it is no more\nlegally significant that the PBA was found, in another case, not to have been acting under color\nof law. than it would have been had there been prior decisions (as there might well have) placing\nparticular actions of the private defendants in Adickes. Lugar. or Leesville beyond the reach of\nsection 1983.\nIn fact, in Hughes v. PBA. the Second Circuit upheld the district court's decision to\nentertain a section 1983 claim based on allegations of \"joint activity\" between the PBA and the\nNYPD - even as it noted that the district court had recognized, correctly, that the union \"was not\na state actor.\"  See 854 F.2d. at 880.  Thus, if this Court were to take the all-or-nothing approach\nthat Defendants seem to embrace, it would be the Court of Appeals' decision in  Hushes, rather\nthan Wright, that necessarily would control.  United States ex rel. Schnitzler v. Follette. 406 F.2d\n319, 322 (2nd Cir. 1969^: cf. generally West v. Atkins. 482 U.S. 42, 56 (1989) (\"It is\n[defendant's] function while working for the State, not... the fact that he may be employed by\nothers to perform similar duties, that determines whether he is acting under color of state law\").\nNor do the decisions in Kern v. Citv of Rochester and Jackson v. Temple Univ.. 731 F.2d\ncolor of law\" Memorandum at 9 (emphasis supplied)  -  nor would the rule be violated here: Mr.\nLouima does allege that \"a governmental  entity  deprived  [him]\" of his rights; the PBA's real\nobjection is to his unwillingness to limit his claims to those among the responsible actors that were\ngovernmental entities or employees.\n18\n\n931 (3rd Cir. 1983) (discussed in the Memorandum at 11-12), help the PBA.  There is no\nsuggestion here that the mere fact that a union's leaders and agents are simultaneously\ngovernment employees would make the union a state actor in its dealings with its own members,\nor that actions which do not involve PBA agents' \"abusing the positions given [them] by the\nstate\" would nonetheless be \"under color of law.\"  Here, unlike in Jackson, there is no room for\narguing that a constitutional violation under color of law did not occur (the only question, as even\nthe PBA acknowledges, is whether Defendants are legally accountable based on their conduct),\nand the complaint describes PBA misconduct - taken pursuant to a widely understood municipal\ncustom, compare Kern. 93 F.3d at 44 - that necessarily involved exercise of power conferred by\nstate law and policy.9\nJackson is even farther afield.  The action at issue in that case was the defendant union's\nallegedly \"unconstitutional\" failure to pursue plaintiff's grievance - there was not even an\nallegation that plaintiffs public \"[ejmployer was in any way involved in the Union's decision not\nto proceed to arbitration,\" id. at 933 — and the Third Circuit affirmed exclusively on the ground\nthat no deprivation had been alleged.  Indeed, the appellate court there followed the district court\nin assuming for purposes of its decision that state action somehow was present, id.  Cf. Polk\nCountry v. Dodson. 454 U.S. 312 (1981) (holding that actions taken by government-paid\n9The fact pattern of Kern might be more analogous if the plaintiff firefighter had shown that\nthe union president responded to Kern's refusal to accept his sexual advances by persuading union\nmember-firefighters not to protect Kern were she endangered while in the line of duty and perhaps\neven more analogous if he instructed that the firefighters refuse to battle any fire that might occur\nat her house.  Cf  Pisello. 933 F. Supp. at 207 (noting that defendant municipality was alleged to\nhave \"arbitrarily refused to act\" on plaintiffs  applications to rebuild his real estate business after\ndestruction by suspiciously motivated fire). Even that hypothetical case would lack the elements of\nlongstanding municipal involvement that characterize the practices and conduct here.\n19\n\ncriminal defense counsel, in connection with adversarial proceeding against the State, are not\n•'fairly attributable to the State\").10\nb.  The Color of Law Requirement Is Satisfied By The PBA's Wilful\nJoint Participation\nAlthough the Memorandum does not press very hard the suggestion that the PBA's status\nas non-governmental entity actually settles the \"color of law\" question, its more sustained\nargument - that the complaint's supposed failure to allege with specificity the \"time and place\"\nof a conspiratorial agreement between the PBA and the City forecloses § 1983 liability,\nMemorandum at 11-13 - is no less fatuous.  This argument simply ignores decades of settled law\nrecognizing the multiple ways by which a private party can act \"under color of law.\" see Anaya.\nprecedent that refutes the notion that proof of the sort of discrete, comprehensive \"agreement\"\nwhich the Memorandum demands is the sine qua non of private party liability under section\n1983.\nThe Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals repeatedly have held private actors\naccountable under § 1983 without proof of the sort of formal agreement that the Memorandum\n'\"Although the PBA makes much of the complaint's contention that its liability may be\nestablished  under respondeat  superior principles, see Memorandum  at  17 (citing *I84 of the\ncomplaint), that same paragraph also alleges that the PBA agents' acts were performed pursuant to\ntheir authority under the union - obviating any need to decide whether any sort of vicarious liability\nmay be imposed. As the remainder of the complaint makes clear, although the actions of Immitt and\nLee - and the post-torture conduct of Wiese - are directly attributable to the PBA (because they were\ncarrying out union policy), the complaint does not allege that Defendants should be held liable for\nthe torture on the theory that the individual officers were acting as agents of the PBA.  To the\ncontrary, the PBA' legal responsibility for Mr. Louima's physical abuse derives jiot from the fact that\nthe individuals who attacked him were union members or agents, but rather from the fact that the\nunion's policies and customs, evincing hostility to the punishment of even the most  wrong-doing\npolice officers, heightened the danger that such violent police actions occur.  See infra (discussing\nlaw governing responsibility based on deliberate indifference).\n20\n\ntreats as indispensable.  In Leesville and Lugar. the Court explicitly upheld liability based on a\nprivate actor's joint participation in unconstitutional conduct (the defendant in Lugar obtained a\nwrit of attachment from a state court clerk, initiating a procedure found to violate the Due\nProcess Clause), notwithstanding the absence of any \"allegation of collusion or conspiracy with\nstate actors,\" 457 U.S. at 943 at n.* (Burger, C.J., dissenting), and in Lusbv the Court of Appeals\nfor the Tenth Circuit did not demand that plaintiff pinpoint the particular time and place where\nthe municipal authorities and private defendants agreed to implement a custom of arrest without\nprobable cause.  Indeed, even in the decision that the PBA has cited, Austin v. Paramount Parks.\nInc.. 195 F.3d 715 (4th Cir. 1999), there is no suggestion that when a plaintiff proves that private\nactors and government officials are longstanding participants in a custom of unconstitutional\nconduct he must further allege a formal agreement entered into at a particular time or place.  Sge\nid. at 728 (\"a private corporation is liable under § 1983 .. .when an official policy or custom of\nthe corporation causes the alleged deprivation of federal rights\"); see also Jackson Lockdown/\nMCQ Cases. 568 F. Supp. 869 (C. D. Mich. 1983) (upholding § 1983 claim against prison\nguards' union, because the union's actions, though opposed by government  officials,\"were\npossible only due to the power conferred on the guards by the state\").\nIndeed, the very nature of municipal liability for \"custom\" -le., a \"practice^ ... so\npermanent and well settled\" as to have the force of law - stands against the idea that a complaint\ncould be dismissed for not stating the time and place at which an \"agreement\" was entered into.\nThus, in Ginsberg v. Healev Car & Truck Leasing. Inc.. 189 F.3d 268,271 (2nd Cir. 1999). the\nSecond Circuit made clear that a section 1983 cause of action lies against a private defendant\nwhen the complaint alleges an arrest pursuant to a municipal custom of reflexive acceptance of\n21\n\nthe defendant's recommendations, a conclusion supported by that Court's earlier opinion in\nDwares. In that case, the Court of Appeals, surveying prior cases involving claims of private §\n1983 liability for concerted action, observed that while a private security guard's merely\nsummoning the police will not suffice to hold the business owner accountable under Section\n1983 for a resulting arrest (even if the guard is an off-duty police officer), the defendant will be\nliable if there is a custom or understanding that individuals reported by the private party will be\narrested without the arresting officer's undertaking any further independent probable cause\ndetermination. Accord Lusby 749 F.2d at 1432 (upholding private defendant's liability in\nMonell case, because municipality maintained a policy that \"delegate[d] a nondelegable duty Qjg,\ndeciding whom to arrest] and facilitates private abuse of criminal charges\").\"  Indeed, even\nAdickes. which described a § 1983 conspiracy as involving a \"meeting of the minds,\" 398 U.S. at\n158, provides scant support for the notion that a particular time and place of \"agreement\" must be\nalleged with particularity: the Supreme Court reversed summary judgment for the defendant\n11 Indeed, it is symptomatic of the \"heads we win, tails you lose\" quality of the PBA's\nMemorandum that Mr. Louima is taken to task, see Memorandum at 13 n.3, for pleading that the\nPB A and City's customs are of long standing. The PBA's arguments that the three-year section 1983\nlimitations period precludes the complaint's reliance on \"acts of conspiracy that allegedly occurred\ntwenty-five years ago\" drastically misread the Second Circuit's decision in Pinaud v. County of\nSuffolk. 52 F.3d 1159 (2nd Cir. 1995). That case did not come close to holding that evidence that\na custom more than three years old is somehow irrelevant or illegitimate; it held that, subject to\nvarious tolling principles, a plaintiff can not bring a suit based on specific  municipal actions\n(pursuant to the long-running policy) that took place more than three years before filing suit.\nAlthough the complaint in this case references practices that go far back in the past (which add force\nto the systemic claims) the wrongs committed against Mr. Louima took place within the limitations\nperiod - and indeed continue.  See Ginsberg. 189 F.3d at 271 (considering evidence of how many\ntimes conduct had occurred \"in the past thirty two years\" in determining whether custom or policy\nexisted); Adickes. 398 U.S. at 173 (\"the relevant inquiry is whether at the time of the episode there\nwas a longstanding and still prevailing state-enforced custom\"); Walker. 974 F.2d at 300 (plaintiff\nwho did ''not expressly allege a history of police perjury ... should be allowed to pursue discovery\nin order to determine whether\" such a practice existed).\n22\n\nnotwithstanding the absence of evidence of communication between the private and public\nactors, on the ground that their \"understanding\" might still be inferred from \"the sequence of\nevents.'\"  See also LeBlanc-Sternberg. 67 F.3d at 427.'2\nThese decisions are consistent with the principle that formal conspiracy represents only\n\"one form\" of the wilful joint participation in unconstitutional conduct that § 1983 prohibits,\nSee Collins. 878 F.2d at 1154 ; Hampton. 600 F.2d at 627.  Indeed, to the extent that civil rights\ndecisions might be read as relying on a less stringent definition of conspiracy than prevails, for\nexample, in the criminal law, the basis for such a distinction would be sound: unlike the criminal\nlaw, § 1983 does not punish the act of wrongful agreement per se - the § 1983 remedy is\navailable only to those whose rights have been deprived, see Singer. 63 F. 3d at 119 - and there\nis no legitimate reason why persons who are wilful joint participants in unconstitutional action  -\nbut cooperate tacitly or pursuant to custom, rather than by express agreement -  should be\nexcused from liability.  Cf  Dennis. 449 U.S. at 27 (affirming decision of lower court concluding\nthat '\"that there was no good reason in law, logic, or policy for conferring immunity on private\npersons who [conspire with governmental actor entitled to official immunity]'\"); McHenrv v.\nChadwick. 896 F.2d 184, 188 (6th Cir. 1990) (civil liability for officer who stands by while others\ncommit constitutional tort).\n1 indeed, relying on the same authority that Defendants cite for the rule that a \"plaintiff must\nprovide details of time and place . . .,\" see Memorandum at 12, the Second Circuit has stated the\nprinciple somewhat differently :\"while a plaintiff should not plead mere evidence, he should make\nan effort to provide some 'details of time and place and the alleged effect of the conspiracy* 2A\nMoore's Federal Practice ffil 8.17[6], at 8-109 to 8-110 (2d ed. 1992).\"  Dwares. 985 F.2d at 99\n(emphasis supplied).  Even that less stringent formulation predated the Supreme Court's decision\nin Leatherman. holding that heightened pleading rules for § 1983 complaints are inconsistent with\nthe Federal Rules.\n23\n\nc. The Complaint Adequately Pleads Joint Participation\nBecause the PBA does not fully acknowledge that wilful joint participation in\nunconstitutional governmental conduct can give rise to § 1983 liability, the Memorandum does\nnot even attempt to carry its Rule 12(b)(6) burden of showing that under \"no set of facts\" could\nthe complaint's allegations state a claim on that theory.  But it is apparent the PBA could not\nhave met that burden had it tried.\nFirst, as to the actions taken after the initial assault on Mr. Louima, the PBA's joint\nparticipation with state actors - police officers acting under color of law - is pleaded in\nundeniably ample and specific detail.  See, e.g.. flf 69-84, 94,106-110, 117, 120-22, 130-33.\nIndeed, these allegations would appear to meet even the supercharged, heightened pleading\nstandards that the PBA asks the Court to impose.\nWith respect Counts XIV and XV, concerning the code of silence, whatever the merits of\nthe contention that the web of customs and policies pursued jointly with the City over the course\nof many years is too \"attenuated\" from Mr. Louima's physical injuries to give rise to section\n1983 liability, see infra, there can be no disagreement that the policies-and customs described in\nthe complaint are plainly \"law, policy, custom or usage\" within the meaning of section 1983. see\nJeffes v. Barnes. 208 F.3d 49, 62 (2nd Cir. 2000) (police code of silence may give rise to\nMonell liability); Sharp v. City of Houston. 164 F.3d 923, 935, 936 (5th Cir. 1999) (affirming\njudgment against city based on code of silence): White-Ruiz v. Citv of New York. 983 F. Supp.\n365 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (finding City liable under Monell principles for code of silence); c£ United\nStates v. Bruder. 2000 WL 290269 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 5,2000) *4 (holding evidence of defendant\nSchwarrs prior coverup activities admissible under Federal Rules to show \"his commitment to\n24\n\nft\nan unwritten ... 'code of silence'\").  Nor does the complaint skimp in its description of the\nPBA's active, wilful involvement in developing, furthering and implementing the challenged\ncustoms and practices.  See, e.g.. ffl| 15-20 (joint role of City and PBA in promoting an\natmosphere \"in which the very worst police officers feel assured that evidence of misdeeds\ndepriving citizens of the civil rights, no matter how awful, will be hidden by PBA\nrepresentatives) 1flJ155-57 (noting joint role of PBA and City in misapplying \"48-hour rule\")\n\"'11164, 169 (noting Mollen Commission's conclusion that PBA puts \"immense pressure\" on\nhonest officers to maintain silence and \"acts as a shelter and protector of the corrupt cop. rather\nthan as a guardian of the interests\" of honest police officers); ffl[ 170-71 (noting past instances of\nPBA misconduct), 1J172 (PBA \"manipulate[s] 48-hour rule and makes improper use  of...\nspurious .. .privilege to orchestrate cover-ups among co-conspirators and identify and silence\npolice witnesses who would otherwise give honest testimony\").\nRather than address itself to the complaint's actual and extensive factual allegations, the\nPBA devotes more than a page of its Memorandum to a recitation of decisions stating that '\"a\nbare allegation of a conspiracy between private and state entities is insufficient to bring the\nprivate entity within Section 1983,\" Memorandum at 12 (quoting, inter alia. Stasman v. Rvan.\n176 F.3d 986,10002 (7lh Cir. 1999)); that complaints must go beyond \"conclusory allegations\";\nand that they must include \"with some degree of particularity the overt acts which defendants\nengaged in.\" Id. (quoting Serbalik v. Grav).  But these unexceptionable rules simply have no\napplication to this complaint, which includes scores of paragraphs describing specific overt acts\ncommitted by the PBA, see, e.g.. 1fl4 (PBA \"disparaged and intimidated those officers who\ndischarged their moral legal and moral duty\" to report to investigators); 1171 (PBA agents\n25\n\nsuppressed information); ^ 59 (PBA pressured defendant Rosario); ^|75 (describing roll call\nappearances by Immitt); 116 (intimidation of witnesses by Immitt and Lee): *J72, 122, 131 (PBA\nsought to humiliate, defame Mr. Louima and to deter him from testifying);  *;83 (describing\nconspiratorial meetings and phone calls); ^[81 (describing PBA treatment of witnesses as\n\"suspects\"); ^|78 (alleging grand jury perjury by defendant Immitt); ^ 132 (PBA \"continues to\ndeter and discourage .. .witnesses from telling the truth\"). In the face of this specificity.\nDefendants\" own broad assertions that the complaint's allegations \"fall far shon of stating a\nviable claim,\" id at 13, have an oddly hollow ring. See also id. at 8 (citing decisions allowing\ncourts to disregard factual allegations when they are \"internally inconsistent\" or \"contradicted by\ndocuments incorporated in complaint\" - without ever suggesting that anv factual allegation in\nMr. Louima's complaint fall into either category!13\nTo the extent that the Memorandum does advance any specific basis for dismissing\ncounts XIV and XV, it is the complaint's supposed failure to \"particularize the overt acts\nallegedly taken by the PBA\" or \"even [to] attempt\" to identify a specific 'agreement' between the\nPBA and the City, \"let alone\"specify the particular \"time and place\" where agreement was\nreached.  Memorandum at 13. As for the overt acts, the paragraphs just cited speak for\nthemselves - all the more so in light of the Second Circuit's admonition that the specificity\nrequired under the Federal Rules is not an end unto itself, but rather must be sufficient to alert the\nPBA of the nature of the claim against which it must defend.  Ricciuti. 941 F.2d at 123.\nAnd whether or not it is \"as replete with factual allegations as the [PBA] might prefer.\"\nl3As noted above, although Count XV might be \"conclusory\" in the literal sense that it does\nnot actually re-plead the necessary factual allegations, which appear in the body of the complaint,\nthe Federal Rules encourage that way of drafting complaints.  See. Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c).\n26\n\nHarvev v. Treder. 1987 WL 47371 *6 (E.D.N.Y. 1987) it is hard to see how a fair-minded reader\nof the complaint -  which devotes more than thirty paragraphs specifically setting out the\nrespective roles of the PBA and the City in jointly creating and maintaining the \"blue wall\" -\ncould find, as the PBA purports to, that it does not even allege a \"nexus\" between those two\ndefendants, Memorandum at 13.\nIf the appropriate question is asked, i^e., whether, at this stage - before the\ncommencement of discovery - the complaint (1) includes sufficient allegations from which joint\nparticipation by the City and PBA could be inferred and (2) makes those allegations with\nspecificity sufficient for Defendants to formulate their responsive pleading, the fate of\nDefendants' motion is sealed. Notwithstanding the PBA's  placing the words ''code of silence\"\nin quotation marks, any claim by Defendants not tO/be^Ble^osrasp from the complaint what role\nMr. Louima alleges the PBA played is not well taken. Among other things, the complaint\nreferences independe; ions that a code of silence exists and that responsibility\nfor it resides, jointly, withthe City (for toleraji ding its inconsistency with the\n—~~^~~^\nrule of law) and the PBA (for projnotingjQ^ and, it alleges, among other things, the role played\nboth by the jointly agreed-to \"48 hour-rule.\" See Messman v. Hemke. 133 F.3d 1042, 1045 n.2\n(7Ih Cir. 1997) (collective bargaining agreejmjeiitpix»yisioj^c^i_^ve rise to joint § 1983 liability),\nby the City's and the PBA's mutual understanding of how the rule should apply in practice (i.e..\n^extending it to criminal, as opposed to merely adminisfrative investigations and allowing the\nunion tajdecide whom to denominate as \"witnesses\" and \"suspects,\" for purposes of the rule's\nprotections), and by the City's acquiescence in certain officers' (PBA delegates) disregarding\n27\n\nCircuit, the PBA, as a private party, could not be held accountable based solely on its role as\n\"wilful participant\" in government actors' unconstitutional conduct, the factual allegations of the\ncomplaint would not permit dismissal for failure to allege PBA action under color of law. First\nand foremost, the complaint identifies the PBA as occupying a pivotal role in a quintessential\nstate function: the investigation of violent crime.  See Dwares (when government delegates\nquintessential governmental responsibility to private party, that party acts under color of law);\naccord Lusbv: cf. Richardson v. McKnieht. 521 U.S. 399 (1997) (upholding denial of qualified\nimmunity to privately employed prison guards sued under § 1983). It is by no means ordinary to\nallow a private party to help decide which individuals suspected or believed to have witnessed\nviolent offenses will be interviewed by law enforcement authorities investigating the crime (or to\ngive the party the power to prevent an interview from taking place, by labeling as a \"witness\"\nsomeone who otherwise might not meet the investigator's understanding of that term), see 1117\n(noting that other jurisdictions show no similar solicitude for police officers suspected of violent\ncrime), and it is all the more so given the PBA's avowed belief that orchestrating cover-ups and\nintimidating witnesses is a part of its job description as collective bargaining agent.  See\nMemorandum at 11; compare Paramount. 195 F.3d at 730 (noting lack of \"evidence that...\npolice officers routinely consulted [private defendant] or obtained his approval concerning\nimpending arrests\").\nSecond, the PBA's agents - including the individual defendants in this case - are\nthemselves police officers, charged by law with apprehending violent criminals (including\nviolent police officers) and bringing them to justice - and endowed by law with unique powers in\norder to do so. See t56 (noting official policy that \"fa]ll members of the service have an\n29\n\nabsolute duty to report... serious misconduct of which they become aware\") (emphasis added).\nAlthough the Memorandum purports not even to perceive a conflict in the dual role of sworn\npeace officer and obstructor of justice - by simply insisting that, even when they wear the\nuniform of the NYPD, PBA agents' obligations to the wrongdoing member are always\nparamount, the complaint makes clear that Defendants maximize, unecessarily and for improper\npurposes, the extent to which these two roles become \"blurred.\"  Memorandum at 2. 14.\nCf. Lusbv. 749 F.2d at 1429 n.2 (noting off-duty police officers \"confusion of his private and\npublic roles\" in holding him - and his private employer - liable under  § 1983).\nIn the first place - and as will be further explained below - the PBA's understanding of\nits officer/agents' competing responsibilities is fundamentally wrong, see In re Grand Jury\nSubpoenas Dated January 20. 1998. 995 F. Supp. 332, 336 (E.D.N.Y. 1998), and under no\nconceivable notion of union privilege would an employee-representative be authorized - let alone\n\"duty-bound,\" Memorandum at 16 - to intimidate witnesses and orchestrate cover-ups, whether\nor not he does so on behalf of his \"client.\" But for \"color of law\" purposes, the significant fact is\nthe extent to which the complaint describes the PBA's using its agents' employment as police\nofficers to accomplish its improper organizational objectives.  Not only do PBA actions take\nplace in ways that are only possible by virtue of the fact that Defendants' agents are themselves\npolice officers, but Defendants accomplish their objectives largely by a unique ability to persuade\ngovernment actors - police officers - not to do their legal duties.  See Waeenmann v. Adams.\nS29 F.2d 196,211 (lsl Cir. 1987) (upholding § 1983 verdict against private defendant because he\n\"possessed and exerted influence over the ... police, and conspired with them to have [plaintiff]\narrested\"); see also Dwares. 985 F.2d at 98 (it is state action when police specifically decline to\n30\n\nprovide protection to an individual for the purpose of allowing private party's wrongful conduct\nto succeed).  Indeed, to the extent that the PBA's ultimate threat against an officer contemplating\ncooperating with a misconduct investigation is that his or her partner - and fellow union member\n- will not respond to a distress call while they are on duty — the PBA exercises leverage that is\nuniquely bound up with state authority. Cf. White-Ruiz. 983 F. Supp.. at 383 (noting that officers\nrefused to assist plaintiff in \"potentially dangerous situation\" in retaliation for her having\nbreached the code of silence).\nThe events of this case supply an example of the myriad ways in which the PBA\naccomplishes its own purposes under guise of law. Although there is no claim that Officers\nVolpe, Schwarz, Bruder, and Wiese were acting as PBA members at the moment they were\nbeating or torturing Mr. Louima, it is abundantly clear that Wiese quickly assumed the role of\nPBA delegate, accompanying Volpe to the hospital on the night of August 9 when he himself\nwas not injured, see Attachment A (Tr. 837-38, Burns),15 and Defendant Schwarz himself\ntestified that telephone calls made to defendant Abbate and others on August 11 - while Mr.\nLouima continued to be treated as a perpetrator, rather than a victim of crime - were made by\nWiese, in his capacity as PBA delegate.  See id. (Tr. 1820-23, Schwarz) (\"Tommy was a delegate\nand as a delegate that is part of his responsibilities\").  Compare Complaint 1J71 (\"defendant PBA\nquickly became involved in the conspiracy\") with Memorandum at 2 (asserting that complaint\nl5Attachment A contains transcripts of testimony at the (second) federal criminal civil rights\ntrial of Defendants Wiese, Bruder, and Schwarz. Although the facts and testimony included are not\nnecessary to state a claim - and need not have been pleaded with specificity in the complaint - such\nmaterial is a proper subject of judicial notice, and the Court accordingly has discretion to consider\nit in evaluating the merits of the PBA's claim that \"no set of facts\" exists that could support its\ninvolvement before August 13. Cf. People v. Rosenberg. 160 A.D.2d 327 (Is1 Dep't 1990).\n31\n\ndoes not allege PBA involvement until August 13 meeting).16\ne. The PBA Actions Are Under \"Color of...  Custom or Usage\"\nFinally, the PBA, no less than the store owner in Adickes. may fairly be held accountable\nunder § 1983 for having acted pursuant to a State-enforced custom of unconstitutional behavior.\nEven if the PBA were not a wilful, joint builder of the \"blue wall\" - which it is -  the complaint\nplainly states that New York police intentionally tolerate violence or threats of violence toward\nthose who violated the practice of maintaining silence concerning police brutality.  When these\nunconstitutional governmental customs are as pervasive as they are properly alleged to be here,\nprivate actors who avail themselves of them, Adickes teaches, may be held to be acting under\n\"color of law.\"\n3.  Under Settled Law, The PBA's Involvement Is \"Personal\"\nNo more tenable than their arguments about the \"color of law\" requirement are\nDefendants' assertions that the link between the code of silence and the actions of the police\nofficers is inadequate as a matter of law to hold the PBA accountable for the harm those officers\ninflicted.  Because the PBA and its agents were not present during the physical abuse of Mr.\nLouima. but c£ f26d. (noting that defendant Wiese was, at the relevant time, a PBA delegate),\nand did not learn of what had been done to him until (soon) afterward, the Defendants insist,\nl6Indeed, Defendants' repeated assertions that the PBA's involvement did not begin until the\nday Mr. Louima's custody ended, August 13, not only misread the complaint, they ignore the sworn\ntestimony of defendant Immitt- a high-ranking PBA official - that he first heard of an incident  -\nfrom Wiese - on August 11, at a time when Mr. Louima remained under arrest, Attachment A (Tr.\n965. Immitt); see also id. (Tr. 966-67) (testifying that meeting in 70lh precinct basement occurred on\neither August 12 or 13).\n32\n\niegal responsibility may not extend beyond the individual officers (or. as the PBA would have it.\n\"officerj') - and the City, which undertook to hire and train those individuals. Memorandum at\n3. Defendants present this argument in three guises: (1) that the PBA is being held vicariously\nliable for the conduct of its members, rather than based on its own involvement; (2) that the code\nof silence described in the complaint cannot be the \"proximate cause\" of the injuries to Mr.\nLouima (because, Defendants say, the climate of lawlessness fostered by the PBA and the City\nmerely \"permitted, rather than caused\" the individual officers' violent assaults); and (3) that the\nPBA. as a labor union and collective bargaining agent, owed no duty to Mr. Louima or any other\ncitizen of New York to refrain from the practices described in the complaint.\nAt the outset - and despite the skepticism that the PBA attempts to convey by use of\nquotation marks - the complaint alleges with unquestionably sufficient particularity the existence\nof a code of silence, and the suggestion that \"Plaintiffs here do not attempt to relate the PBA's\nwrongful practices to plaintiffs' injuries,\" Memorandum at 21, is especially perplexing.  Scores\nof paragraphs of the complaint reference trial testimony and independent findings attesting to the\nexistence and operation of the \"blue wall\" - and to the PBA's role in maintaining it.\nAnd any burden on Mr. Louima's part to allege a \"relation\" between this custom and his\ninjury arguably is satisfied by this single paragraph of his complaint:\n/-~-N After the torture, defendant Volpe displayed the stick to other police officers at\nthe precinct and bragged to them about what he had done.\n1J47. It is unimaginable that anyone but a New York City police officer fully versed in the code\nof silence would do what Volpe did - boast of having committed a barbaric criminal act and\nbrandish the inculpatory evidence for all to see - to an audience of on-dutv New York Police\n33\n\nOfficers inside a precinct house, and, as the complaint describes, Volpe's confidence in the\ncode's potency proved not to have been misplaced. Not a single one of those officers who\nwitnessed this depraved display came forward promptly to implicate him — as legal duty (not to\ni  mention human decency) obliged them to, see 1fl[55,56 - and even officers who had no personal\nconnection to the 70th precinct or the individual defendants understood that their role was to lie\non behalf of the culpable officers to investigatory authorities, ^ge ffl 49,57-58 (describing\nconduct giving rise to criminal convictions of defendants Rosario and Aleman). See Kibbe v.\nCitv of Springfield. 777 F.2d 801, 805-6 (1st Cir. 1985) (upholding municipal liability for\nbrutality, because participation of numerous officers \"is more likely to reflect the operating\nprocedures of the police department\"), cert, dismissed. 480 U.S. 257 (1987). Nor are Defendants\non more solid ground when they contend that the complaint insufficiently pleads PBA\ninvolvement in and responsibility for the code of silence. The complaint explains in considerable\ndetail how the PBA, both in the past and in this case, has taken the lead role in assuring that\nguilty officers tell a false but consistent story,  ffi[14,15,19,20,71-74,155,  and that those\nindividual officers who might otherwise consider coming forward to perform their duty and tell\nthe truth are persuaded - if necessary by threats and intimidation - to remain silent.  1fl[l4,75,76,\n164.169,170,173. These efforts operate in conjunction with the City's documented dereliction\nin investigating and disciplining officers who lie, fail to come forward, or threaten those who do\ncome forward.  Sge.f fl[ 148-74.\na.  The Link Between The Code of Silence And The Injuries  Satisfies\nSection 1983's Causation Requirement\nThe PBA's assumption that an allegation of \"direct involvement in the assault on\n34\n\nLouima.\" id. at 18, is a necessary precondition of PBA liability simply misstates the law.\nAlthough section 1983 does not provide for strict or vicarious liability, the Supreme Court,\nlooking to the history and text of the statute - which provides a cause of action against a party\nwho \"subjects or causesr-fanother] to subjectf]\" a plaintiff to a deprivation of his civil rights -\nrepeatedly has held tha| practices and customs exhibiting deliberate indifference to violent\ndeprivations at ground level suffice to establish § 1983 liability for entities and individuals who\nare not contended to have been \"direct participants\" in the actual violence.  See Monell. 436 U.S.\nat 692;  cf  M. AVERY, K. BLUM & D. RUDOVSKY, POLICE MISCONDUCT LAW & LITIGATION\n(1999) § 4-6 (\"[m]otions to dismiss or for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff has\nnot pleaded or established... 'personal participation' in the acts complained of are not well\ntaken\").\nAs the Southern District explained recently, rejecting a former New York Police\nCommissioner's arguments that he could not be held accountable for unconstitutional retaliation\ni\nagainst an officer because \"he was not aware of any retaliation against [her]\": \"there is no\nrequirement that the supervisor be personally aware of the specific acts of misconduct about\nwhich the plaintiff is complaining.\" White-Ruiz.  Rather, the court continued:\nThe Second Circuit has determined that \"personal involvement\" may be defined as\n\"(1) direct participation, or. (2) failure to remedy the alleged wrong after learning\nof it, or.

Doe. 139 F.3d at 112.\nThis is the unmistakable import of the Supreme Court's teaching in Monell and its\nprogeny, and both that Court and the Second Circuit have repeatedly affirmed what the PBA\nsuggests cannot be the case: that i defendant may be held accountable for violent constitutional\ndeprivations without itself having \"directly\" participated in the violence or deprivation of rights.\nSee Citv of Canton v. Harris. 489 U.S. 378,390 n.10  (1989) (municipality's failure to train\npolice in use of deadly force can give rise to  liability for unconstitutional taking of life). Thus,\nin Dodd v. Citv of Norwich, the Second Circuit rejected a defendant's claim that a municipal\npolicy concerning when police would holster their guns could not have caused the death of a\nsuspect who tried to grab the revolver from the officer who was arresting him:\nThe city contends on appeal that the \"cause\" of Dodd's death was his own\nvoluntary act in lunging for the exposed gun and was not any act or policy of the\ncity. Monell's view of causation is, we think, more encompassing than such a\nnarrow, immediate focus on the cause of the shooting. In adopting its policies a\nmunicipality must take into consideration the reasonably foreseeable conduct not\nonly of its own employees but also of those citizens with whom its employees will\ninteract. Basic principles of causation would render the policy a proximate cause\nof Dodd's death if Dodd's intervening actions were \"within the scope of the\noriginal risk\" and therefore foreseeable. W.

Memorandum at 24 n.7.  Whatever\nthe merits of the decisions cited by the PBA, Defendants travel a long way from asserting that Mr.\nLouima has \"departed from reality\" for having even suggested that there is a code of silence to\nacknowledging the existence of a code, but arguing that it protects only venal, but not violent police\nofficers.  In point of fact, the Mollen Commission - whose mandate was to study police corruption\n-  surely did not conclude that the same union pressures that allow corruption to flourish are not\npresent in cases of brutality, and its harsh findings concerning the union's and the City's support for\nthe code of silence hardly helps the PBA carry its burden of showing that there is \"no set of facts\"\nthat could establish the legal responsibility sketched out for the PBA in the complaint.

Supp. 77 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)).\nAccording to the PB A, because the courts in these cases ruled for the tort defendants, on the\nground that \"proximate cause\" cannot be established \"merely\" by showing the defendant\n\"creatjed] the circumstances that occasion an injury,\" it follows that \"merely\" creating an\nenvironment where police violence goes unpunished is not enough to hold the PBA (and the\nCity) responsible under § 1983 for the consequences of any violence that actually ensues.\nMemorandum at 21.\nAt the outset, if there were any conflict between what is required by New York tort law\nand what has been held necessary to establish causation under § 1983, the latter obviously would\nbe controlling here.  See Fiacco. 783 F.2d at 326 (expressly rejecting defendant's assertion \"that\na \"policy that... merely permits or tolerates unconstitutional acts by city employees cannot be\nthe basis for municipal liability under § 1983\"); Mvers v. Citv of Orange. 157 F.3d 66, 74 (2nd\nCir. 1998) (\"defendants in § 1983 actions may be held liable for those consequences attributable\nto reasonably foreseeable intervening forces, including the acts of third parties\") (citation\nomitted). But even the cases the Memorandum cites - arising from factual settings that are far\nof corruption or dishonesty by fellow officers\" - the existence of which apparently was conceded\nby defendants - was irrelevant to claim that code was enforced for reporting ethnic favoritism).\n40\n\nremoved from those presented here - do not announce the legal rule that the PBA argues for.\nIndeed, those cases and others decided under New York law affirm that a defendant will be liable\neven for damages caused by an intervening intentional tort if the defendant foresaw or should\n______  •\nhave foreseen that the misconduct would ensue. Kush-byMarszalek v. Cltvof Buffalo,  59\nN.Y.2d 26 (1983). Thus, in Heredia, the court, in refusing to impose tort liability on a defendant\nwho lent a car (in violation of an administrative regulation) to another whose negligent driving\ncaused injury, stressed that the possibility of third parties' careless driving was not the problem\ntoward which the regulatory prohibition was aimed.  See 887 F. Supp. at 83 (plaintiffs  injury\nwas not \"foreseeable, because the regulations were [not] intended to protect against the kind of\nharm which actually occurred\"). Here, Defendants stand accused not merely of negligence\nconcerning foreseeable wrongful conduct (which is all that New York tort law actually requires)\n-  but of a custom and policy of reckless and deliberate indifferencejto the very consequence that\nensued: that their actions would embolden violent police brutality.\nIn similar fashion, the Memorandum steers clear of precedents such as Adickes. and\nLusbv. which address the extent of § 1983 liability for conduct - like that here - whose\nunconstitutionality is beyond doubt, directing the Court's attention to decisions denying § 1983\nrelief on the analytically distinct ground that the plaintiff had failed to show deprivation of a\nconstitutional right.  While the Supreme Court's decisions Deshanev v. Winnebago County\nDep't Soc. Servs.. 489 U.S. 189 (1989)  and Martinez v. California. 444 U.S. 277 (1980), stand\nfor the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment does not include a general right to\ngovernment protection from private violence, but cf. Dwares. 985 F.2d at 98-99 (recognizing that\nthe Deshanev rule does not foreclose all failure-to-protect liability), neither case purported to\n41\n\ndecide when a private defendant can be held accountable based on its involvement in actions that\nwere unconstitutional and committed under color of law.18 The proper legal standards for linking\ncustoms and policies to particular constitutional deprivations are not undemanding, see Walker.\n974 F.2d at 297-98. but the cases cited, which address an entirely distinct element of section\n1983 liability are unilluminating.\nFinally, the notions of duty that the PBA seeks to inject into this case simply have no\nplace under section 1983. The sources of the PBA's legal obligation to Mr. Louima are the\nConstitution and § 1983 itself, which provides a remedy against all persons who participate in\ndeprivations of federal rights accomplished under color of law. Once more, the PBA's selective\nsampling of State cases could hardly be less probative. In Burns Jackson Miller Summit &\nSpitzer. 59 N.Y.2d 314,464 N.Y.S.2d 712 (N.Y. 1983), see Memorandum at 16, the New York\nCourt of Appeals addressed a question of the New York Legislature's intent: whether a private\nright of action could be implied from the statute prohibiting strikes by municipal unions.\" The\nquestion presented for this Court^s-deetsien is diametrically different: the statute under which the\nPBA is sued is one whotfe specific and exclusive purpose is to provide a cause of action against\n18A1 though Martinez does include language indicating that the \"decedent's death is too remote\na consequence of the parole officers' action to hold them responsible under the federal civil rights\nlaw,\" this observation, which came after the Court's  holding that the plaintiff had failed to allege\nthe deprivation of a federal right, was explicitly limited to the facts of the \"particular parole\ndecision\" before the Court.  444 U.S. at 285.  The Court's decision also expressed reluctance to\nimpose constitutional obligations in the \"practical and troublesome area,\" of parole decision making.\n444 U.S. at 283; see 'yL (noting that \"basic risk that repeat offenses may occur is always present in\nany parole system\").\nl9Notably, while the New York Court of Appeals held that the statute could not be privately\nenforced through a damages action, it affirmed lower court rulings that unions could be sued - albeit\nnot by the particular plaintiff -  on a common law public nuisance theory, he., that there were\npreexisting common law duties that the statute had not abolished.\n42\n\nthose who wilfully participate in deprivations of individual rights under color of law.20 j Indeed.\n~-—-^\neven if abstract common law categories applied, the tort duties to refrain from the sort of wilful\nand reckless misconduct alleged in the complaint run against the world. See also infra, at V.\n(discussing PBA's common law responsibilities for its actions).\nb.  Section 1983 Fully Applies to Labor Unions Who Act Jointly With State\nActors to Deny Civil Rights\nTo the extent that the Memorandum argues, see id. at 16, that labor unions can only be\nsued for actions taken in their proprietary capacity - and therefore not under Section 1983 - the\n20Lizzi v. National Ass'n of Letter Carriers. 755 F. Supp. 68 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (discussed.\nMemorandum at 15), is, if anything, even less relevant. The labor union defendant in that case was\nnot charged with maintaining a custom or a policy of reckless disregard for the constitutional rights\nof the plaintiff: the sole claim was that the union's (successful) representation of one of its members\nin connection with his disciplinary hearing made the defendant responsible for a subsequent tortious\nact committed within the scope of his employment. Here, liability is not based on the PBA's having\nkept Volpe, for example, on the force, by representing him in administrative disciplinary hearings\nand thereby \"furnishing the condition\" for him to brutalize again. S[ee \\  145 (noting, in the course\nof claim against the City, that \"the Police Department received a number of complaints concerning\ndefendant Volpe's excessive use of force on civilians,\" which were wrongly determined to have been\n\"unfounded\"); see also \\ 149 (citing Police Department's failure to take disciplinary action against\nSchwarz for having \"testified untruthfully at a departmental hearing in an unsuccessful attempt to\nhelp defendant Abbate - himself the object of more than two dozen civilian complaints - on the\nforce\").\nRather, the complaint charges the PBA's custom of using extralegal means to protect the\nmost violent and lawless police officers -  a practice that has the near certain result of producing\nconstitutional deprivations (although the paragraphs cited would have some relevance if Defendants\nwere staking their dismissal motion, as they are not, on the idea that the individual officers were not\naware of the blue wall.  See Batista v. Rodriguez. 702 F.3d 393, 399 (2nd Cir. 1983) (rejecting\nMonell claim for lack of evidence that officer defendants \"were aware of any City policy condoning\npolice violations of civil rights\").  Moreover, the PBA's insistence that it owes \"no duty*' to Mr.\nLouima is especially jarring, given that so many of the cover-up activities in which the Defendants\nstand accused of having played a central role involved the PBA's singling Mr. Louima out for\nmaltreatment.\n43\n\ngoverning law is, yet again, emphatically to the contrary.21  To begin with, municipal unions are\nregularly subjected to section 1983 liability under the same standards as are others who violate\nconstitutional rights. This includes in cases where the constitutional deprivation is accomplished\nthrough operation of a collective bargaining agreement.  See, e.g.. Messman v. Hemke. 133 F.3d\nat 1045 n.2 (noting absence of dispute that municipal employees' union \"was acting under color\nof state law when it joined with the City in drafting and ratifying the [collective bargaining\nagreement]\"); Bromley v. Michigan Educ. Ass'n. 82 FJd 686 (6th Cir. 1996) (entertaining § 1983\ncase against union for having abridged represented bargaining unit member's free speech rights);\nAndrews v. Education Ass'n of Cheshire. 829 F.2d 335 (2nd. Cir. 1987) (same).\nUnions are routinely held liable under federal civil rights statutes for their role in having\nencouraged, agreed to, or acquiesced in policies that lead to deprivations of third parties' civil\n2lAlthough not relevant to the question of section  1983 liability, the PBA exaggerates\nconsiderably when it posits that these decisions stand for a universal common law principle that \"a\nunion is not legally responsible for torts committed by its members,\" Memorandum at 16. Although\nthose cases arguably hold that a union will not be held responsible for a tort based only on the fact\nthat their lawful representation of a member/tortfeasor in a grievance proceeding was a but-for cause\nof subsequent misconduct, unions have been held accountable when their involvement extends\nbeyond good-faith discharge of clear statutory duties.  See, e.g.. Browne v. International Bhd. of\nTeamsters. 203 A.D.2d 13, 609 N.Y.S.2D 237 (1994) (upholding union liability for strike-related\nviolence).  Similarly, the Memorandum might be literally correct in saying that \"unions have not\nbeen held liable in tort for their actions as unions,\" icL (emphasis supplied), in that the decisions the\nPBA chooses to cite declined to hold union defendants liable, there are many decisions that do hold\nunions liable for tort, see Caso  v. District Council 37. AFSCME. 350 N.Y.S.2d 173 (A.D. 1973).\nIndeed, the New York Court of Appeals held, in Burns Jackson, that unions may be sued in tort, but\nfound no liability on the facts of that case. See also Bovle v. Anderson Fire Fighters Ass'n Local\n1262. AFL-CIO. 497 N.E.2d 1073 (Ind. App. 2 Dist.1986) (fighting fires was \"ministerial duty\"\nowed by union members to all members of general public); Burke & Thomas. Inc. v. International\nOrg. of Masters. Mates & Pilots. 600 P.2d 1282 (Wash. 1979) (\"We do not question that a public\nemployee union may be held to answer for its torts\"). As will be shown below, there are many more\ndecisions holding unions accountable for conduct \"as unions\" committed, as here, in violation of\ncivil rights laws.\n44\n\nrights.  See, e.g.. McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp.. 427 U.S. 273, 284 (1976) (union Title VII\nliability is appropriate when union \"acquiesced and/or joined in\" employer's discriminatory\npolicies); Guerra v. Manchester Terminal Corp.. 498 F.2d 641, 656 (5th Cir. 1974) (union liable\nfor inducing employer to discriminate); Philbrook v. Ansonia Bd. of Educ, 757 F.2d 476,487\n(2nd Cir. 1985), aff d in part and remanded on other grounds. 479 U.S. 60 (1986) Qoint union\nliability for failure to accommodate employee's religious practice);  Murphv v. Miller Brewing\nCo.. 307 F. Supp. 829 (E.D. Wis. 1969). Once more, the PBA purports to provide the Court with\na snapshot of the legal landscape but has managed to place its thumb over the part of the lens that\nwould capture the many precedents (here, an overwhelming majority) that do not support its\nassertions.\nFinally, the Court need not be long detained with the  PBA's contention that Mr. Louima\nseeks to hold the union accountable for actions resulting from the \"necessary\" performance of its\ntasks as collective bargaining agent, charged with responsibility for representing guilty and\ninnocent members aUke.^Alih.ciughJheLMemorandum's warnings that section 1983 liability here\nwould convert unions into  '\"judges'\" rather than '\"advocates,\"' see jd  (quoting Lizzie may have\nsome abstract rhetorical bite, they are stunningly inapposite to the facts set out in the complaint\nin this case.\nFirst, it is not \"necessary\" that those who engage in violent misconduct have as their\n\"'advocates\" individuals who are themselves police officers, under a sworn duty to uphold the law\nand protect the public.  As Judge Raggi held in finding that communications between PBA\nagents and police officer members were not privileged against disclosure to a grand jury, there  is\nno even arguable basis for barring disclosure to those other than the employer, see In re Grand\n45\n\nJury Subpoenas Dated January 20. 1998. 995 F. Supp. 332, 336 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (distinguishing\nCitv of Newburgh on that basis), and there is no reason why the PBA's members' need for\nconfidential advice cannot be met through direct consultation with (union-provided) criminal\ndefense lawyers.  See id. at 339 & n.6 (noting that officers were \"competent to discuss [their]\nconcerns fully and frankly with licensed counsel\" and contrasting union representatives with\ntranslators or others whose services truly are required \"to facilitate communication between\nattorney and client\"). In the face of this ruling, which involved the same parties and arose from\nthe same underlying facts as does this case, it is striking that the PB A continues here to assen\nthat there is an implicit exception to an officer's duty to protect the public for cases where that\npolice officer is a PBA agent and where the criminal is a union member who has brutalized a\ncivilian.\nIn fact, Mr. Louima does not seek to hold the PBA accountable for good-faith efforts to\nprotect its members' legal rights - or even solely for wrongful nondisclosure of officers' criminal\nconfessions.  See f 19 (\"The. PBA and its agents are not mere passive receptacles of inculpatory\ninformation.  Instead, in this case and many others, the PBA [acts affirmatively]... with the\nspecific intent of determining what evidence of criminality must and can be hidden from law\nenforcement authorities\"). The complaint describes actions that go far beyond what any\n\"advocate\" may - let alone \"must\" - go.  See In re Grand Jury Subpoena Puces Tecum Dated\nSept. 15. 1983. 731 F.2d 1032, 1038 (2nd Cir. 1984) (\"advice in furtherance of [fraudulent or\nunlawful] goals is socially perverse ... and not worthy of protection under ordinary rules of\n[attorney/client privilege]\"). Although the Memorandum does not say so in so many words, the\nPBA's position only becomes coherent - but still not correct, obviously - if suborning perjury,\n46\n\nintimidating witnesses, and obstructing the resolution of investigations of violent crimes are\nreally \"necessary\" incidents of the duty running from union to member.  But the law is clear that\neven a criminal defense lawyer- whose duty of advocacy is long-established and jealously\nprotected - may not engage in that sort of conduct, and if an attorney is accused of having done\nso, it is no defense, as the PBA seems to assume, that he was advancing his client's interests.\nCf. United States v. Faver. 523 F.2d 661 (2nd Cir. 1975). Indeed, as the allegations of the\ncomplaint make clear, the PBA's actions do not even meet that description: although violent\ncriminals such as Schwarz, Volpe, and Wiese may benefit from the union's approach, honest\nofficer/members who are deterred from coming forward - as the law requires them to do - are\nactually placed in harm's way (although the risk is, concededly, a largely theoretical one, given\nthe City's lax record of discipline for those who commit code-of-silence violations, see, e.g.. %\n165); see generally ^ 164 (noting Mollen Commission conclusion that \"the PBA \"often acts as a\nshelter and protector of the corrupt cop, rather than as a guardian of the interests of the vast\nmajority of its membership, who are honest police officers\").\n4. The Complaint Adequately States a Deprivation of Federal Rights\nThe PBA's final line of defense against section 1983 liability is to argue that the\ncomplaint does not state a claim that the PBA deprived Mr. Louima of rights that are of\n\"constitutional\" dimension.  Memorandum at 18-20. There can, of course, be no question that\nMr. Louima's complaint states a claim under § 1983 for arrest without probable cause, see\nWevant v. Okst. 101 F.3d 845 (2nd Cir. 1996); for use of unreasonable force by beating him\nwhile he was handcuffed.in the squad car, Graham v. Connor. 490 U.S. 386 (1989); use of\nunreasonable force by the degrading and violent torture in the precinct house, Powell v. Gardner.\n47\n\n891 F.2d 1039 (2nd Cir. 1989), deliberate indifference to his need for medical attention while in\ncustody, see Wevant. 101 F.3d at 857: Tavlor v. Bowers. 966 F.2d 417 (8th Cir. 1992), and for\ncontinued detention, Le±, shackling him to his hospital bed, without probable cause. With respect\nto these undeniable constitutional injuries, the PBA rests its demand for excuse from section\n1983 liability only on the ground, discussed in the preceding pages, that these specific actions\nare. one way or another, too remote as a matter of law from the PBA's wrongful customs and\npractices.\nThe Memorandum - necessarily - takes a different tack regarding claims arising from\nthose actions, many specifically directed at Mr. Louima by the PBA, which were aimed at\ndeterring and discrediting his testimony, interfering with the ordinary course of justice, and\npunishing him for pursuing legal redress. Even if the allegations of the complaint are true, the\nDefendants submit, Le^, if (1) the PBA, knowing that Mr. Louima had suffered  life-threatening\ninjuries through the vicious acts of the individual defendants, promptly took the side of his\ntormentors, (2) used imprjp^  the individual\nofficers from having to answer criminally and civilly for their actions, and (3) embarked on a\ncampaign specifically designed to inflict further emotional harm on Mr. Louima and his family,\nin order, among other things, to deter him from seeking redress and from testifying in criminal\ncases (and to dissuade authorities and jurors from crediting his allegations), such actions do not\nstate a constitutional claim.  See  Memorandum at 19. This argument has two parts: (1) a\ncontention that the complaint does not state a claim against the PBA for unreasonable seizure\nbecause it (supposedly) does not allege PBA involvement before August 13 - the same day that\nMr. Louima was finally released from police custody, see jd., and (2) an assertion that the PBA's\n48\n\ncover-up-related conduct violated no constitutional right of Mr. Louima's, because his right to\npetition for redress supposedly has not been compromised.  See Memorandum at 3 (asserting Mr.\n\"Louima has had his day in court\"). The very pendency of this civil suit, the PBA insists, is\nconclusive proof that Mr. Louima has no viable constitutional claim. Id.. Neither prong of the\nPBA's argument holds up under scrutiny.\nWith respect to the first, it is well to note what did not happen: there is no basis in the\ncomplaint (or in fact) for believing that the PBA, upon learning of the extreme bmtality that had\nbeen visited upon Mr. Louima, set out promptly to set matters right, only to find out that Mr.\nLouima had, that same day, already been ordered freed. ££  United States v. Dallas. 2000 WL\n1473896 (2nd Cir. Oct. 4, 2000) *4 (stating requirements for abandonment defense in criminal\nconspiracy).  For purposes of this motion, it must be accepted that the PBA was meeting on\nAugust 13 in an effort to determine which lies were necessary to frustrate the course of justice\nand what conduct directed at Mr. Louima would be most effective in humiliating and silencing\nhim. The nub of the PBA's assertion, then, is only that the fluke of timing (L&, that both the\nmeeting described in the complaint and the release occurred on the same day) means that the\nPBA cannot be held responsible for \"any deprivation of Mr. Louima's rights from August 9 to\nAugust 13\" - even if it may plainly be inferred from the complaint's allegations that, had Mr.\nLouima not been released, Defendants would have taken whatever steps thought necessary to\nperpetuate the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\nBut this entire argument rests on an inaccurate - and, for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes, entirely\nuntenable - reading of the complaint: as affirmatively alleging that the basement meeting on\nAugust 13 represented Defendants' first involvement.  In fact, the complaint specifically pleads\n49\n\nthat \"defendant PBA quicklv became involved in the conspiracy and through its agents,  plaved a\nsignificant role in advancing the cover-up.\" 1J71. Defendant Immitt himself has testified that, as\nearly as August 10, he had been made aware (by defendant Wiese) that something had happened\nat the 70Ih Precinct,  and more important, both Defendant Schwarz and Inspector Burns of the\nInternal Affairs Bureau testified under oath that Wiese . a PBA delegate, was carrying out the\nduties of PBA agent, in connection with this case, as early as August 10. See Attachment A.22\nThe circularity of the PBA's argument concerning Mr. Louima's First Amendment rights\nis not easy to miss. At the same time that the Memorandum purports to accept that Mr. Louima,\nlike other citizens, enjoys a First Amendment right to petition the government - including the\ncourts and the authorities charged with investigating the crimes committed against him - it insists\nupon a rule that would make that right a practical nullity. Under Defendants' view of the law, if\nefforts to intimidate a would-be plaintiff succeed, then a wrongdoer will escape liability for both\nhis wrongdoing and the bad acts committed after the fact; and if, as here, a cover-up is less than\nentirely successful, and the plaintiff makes it to court, no \"deprivation\" has occurred.\nAlthough the Memorandum - uncharacteristically - cites supporting authority that is in\npoint (albeit from a District Court in another Circuit, §ge Memorandum at 19 (citing Griffin v.\n22Although Defendants might argue, with some plausibility, that Wiese had a personal interest\nthai transcended his role as PBA delegate, it is far too early to determine which of the three hats -\nviolent criminal, police officer, or PBA fixer - Defendant Wiese was wearing at any particular time,\nespecially in view of specific testimony offered that it was the latter of these.\nAs for defendant Abbate, although he was not, at the times relevant, an employee or official\nrepresentative of the PBA, the facts alleged in the complaint do not foreclose his being found to be\nDefendants' agent  With the benefit of discovery, the precise nature of Abbate's relationship with\nDefendants should become more clear.\n50\n\nHolv. 1996 WL 556969 (N.D. 111. Sep. 26, 1996V): see also Vasquez v. Hernandez. 60 F.3d 325.\n332 (7th Cir. 1996), other courts have had no difficulty perceiving the perverseness of such a\nrule.  See, e.g.. Bell v. Citv of Milwaukee. 746 F.2d 1205, 1261 (7th Cir. 1984) (noting that a\nnarrow interpretation of the court access right \"would encourage police officials to conceal the\ncircumstances relating to unlawful killings\"); Gonsalves  v. Citv of New Bedford. 939 F. Supp.\n921, 927 (D. Mass. 1996) (if \"the mere filing of a suit was sufficient in  every case to extinguish a\n1983 claim for cover-up, the concept would be a nullity because the issue of cover-up is only\npresented to a court once a case is filed\"), and that narrow understanding is not the law of this\nCircuit.  See Barrett v. United States. 798 F.2d 565, 575 (2nd Cir. 1986) (allowing claim to go\nforward based on diminution of value of verdict because defendants' \"obstruction of justice in\nconducting a defense to that action deprived [plaintiffs] not of the whole of their ... lawsuit, but\nonly of a part of that protected property\"); McGartv v. Town of Carmel. 997 F. Supp. 435,437\n(S.D.N.Y. 1998): see also Rvland v. Shapiro. 708 F.2d 967, 973-74 (5th Cir. 1983) (observing\nthat \"any interference with a substantive constitutional right, such as the right of access to the\ncourts, may by itself amount to a constitutional deprivation\" and noting that cover-up related\ndelay \"would cause stale evidence,\" and make litigation more expensive); Gonsalves. 939 F.\nSupp. at 927 (\"[t]he fact that the plaintiff filed this lawsuit despite the immediate, intentional\nefforts to cover-up the beating and the denial of medical care that the jury found proven does not\nextinguish the defendants' potential liability for cover-up\").\nIndeed, the wrongfulness of such an interpretation of the First Amendment is not limited\nto these undeniably perverse consequences: in fact, the rule the PBA presses for is in powerful\ntension with basic postulates of constitutional law. As an initial matter, the \"right 'to petition for\n51\n\na redress of grievances [is] among the most precious of liberties safeguarded by the Bill of\nRights' and is 'intimately connected ... with the other First Amendment rights of free speech\nand free press,'\" Gaeliardi v. Village of Pawling. 18 F.3d 188, 194-95 (2nd Cir. 1994) (quoting\nUnited Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Ass'n. 389 U.S. 217 (1967)), and those other guarantees of\nthe First Amendment consistently have been held violated by policies that merely make their\nexercise more difficult - irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff actually decides to run the\ngauntlet. See Davis v. Village Park II Realty Co . 578 F.2d 461,463 (2nd Cir. 1978), or whether\nthe challenged policy amounts to a complete prohibition of protected activity.  See New York\nTimes v. Sullivan. 376 U.S. 254 (1964);  Arkansas Writers Project v. Ragland; 481 U.S. 221\n(1987); Rutan v. Illinois Reublican Party. 497 U.S. 62, 72-73 (1990) (it was error, in public\nemployee's First Amendment case, to require proof of an adverse action \"substantially equivalent\n[to] dismissal\"); see generally LeBlanc-Sternberg. 67 F.3d at 426 (\"since the loss of First\nAmendment freedoms, even for minimal periods of time, constitutes irreparable injury ... the\nvictim of a conspiracy to deprive First Amendment freedoms has standing to bring suit before the\nconspiracy has resulted in economic or tangible injury\"); see also Fisher v. Citv of Cincinnati.\n753 F. Supp. 681 (S.D. Ohio 1990) (explaining inapplicability of procedural due process\nstandards in case brought under First Amendment court access right).\nTo the extent that decisions such as Griffin or Vasquez have relied on Bounds v. Smith.\n430 U.S. 817 (1977) and  Lewis v. Casev. 518 U.S. 343 (1997), as establishing that the right to\ncourt access is violated only when it is substantially burdened, they have overlooked a number of\nlegally critical distinctions.  Not only did those decisions arise in the prison setting, where\ngovernment interference with First Amendment rights are most tolerated, see Turner v. Saflev.\n52\n\n482 U.S. 78 (1987), they have involved prison rules and practices that have the unintended effect\nof making court access more difficult.  Here, the intent was to burden Mr. Louima's rights. See\nHudspeth v. Fieeins. 584 F.2d 1345, 1348 (4th Cir. 1978); McGartv v. Town of Carmel. 997 F.\nSupp. 435 (S.D.N.Y. 19981: see generally Loper v. New York Citv Police Dept. 999 F.2d 699.\n705 (First Amendment inquiry is more searching in cases of intended, as opposed to incidental,\nburdens on First Amendment freedoms).23\nBut even the dubiously restrictive approach could not support granting Defendants'\nmotion to dismiss here. To the contrary, the complaint adequately alleges that the PBA has\ninterfered with - and continues to - Mr. Louima's right to obtain meaningful relief for his\ninjuries.  See Nielsen v. Clavton. 1995 WL 417569 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"Where a cover-up of a\nconstitutional deprivation continues during trial, plaintiffs are being denied adequate, effective\nand meaningful access to the courts. Thus, plaintiffs were entitled to recover for emotional\n23Dissenting  from  the  Seventh  Circuit's  decision  in  Vasquez.  Judge  Crabb  argued\npersuasively that if prejudice is to be treated as an element of right of court access claim, the\nanalytical framework should build on doctrine developed in cases addressing the constitutionality\nof governmental delay in indicting or trying defendants.  In such cases, she explained:\ndeliberate delay by the government  weighs heavily  in favor  of finding  breach of the\nconstitutional  right  [I]n pre-indictment delay cases, deliberate delay may impute a\nviolation of due process even if the indictment is brought within the limitations period. I see\nno reason to alter this analysis when examining interference with access to the courts caused\nby a conspiracy of state actors. The reason for delay in this particular case could hardly be\nmore egregious. The very nature of a conspiracy makes it difficult for parties from whom\nevidence or other information is being withheld to determine the extent of their harm. When\nstate actors seek to protect one or more of their own by concealing evidence, hindering\ninvestigation or failing to cooperate with the judicial process, it is all the more difficult to\ndiscern the full extent of the victim's deprivation. Where, as here, there is evidence of a\nconspiracy to intentionally impede justice, the showing of prejudice required should be minimal.\n60 F.3d at 332 (Crabb, D.J., dissenting) (citation omitted).\n53\n\ndistress suffered until they obtained relief for Nielsen's death, which was when the jury returned a\nverdict in their favor\") (cited in Gonsalves. 939 F. Supp. at 927). The complaint alleges, for\nexample, that, by dint of the cover-up, critical evidence has been destroyed, \"potentially\ninculpatory evidence\" was removed, and false stories were solidified; and needless expenses\nincurred.  See also f26.o. (noting that identities of \"William Woe\" PBA defendants remain\nunknown to Mr. Louima); cf  Davis, 578 F.2d at 463. The price for Mr. Louima's perseverance\nhas been extreme emotional extreme hardship - including both fear of physical retribution and\nthe humiliation pursued by the PBA. Finally, although acquittals have no preclusive effect in this\ncivil case. Defendants' efforts - the many specifics of which remain unknown to Mr. Louima at\nthis stage - have placed upon Mr. Louima the burden of proving conduct, such as the police car\nbeating, that would already have been established had Defendants permitted justice to run its\ncourse.24\nIII. The PBA Actions Violate The Civil Rights Conspiracy Laws\nA. The PBA's Liability For Section 1986 Does Not Depend on Proving Its\nConspiratorial Involvement\nThe PBA makes only one argument in support of its contention that count XII of the\ncomplaint, charging Defendants with neglect to prevent a civil rights conspiracy, must be\n24Finally. to the extent that Defendants maintain that their conduct does not fall within the\ndoctrinal  prohibitions  of  the  First  Amendment,  that  does  not  mean  that  dismissal  would\nautomatically be warranted. See County of Sacremento v. Lewis. 523 U.S. 833,843 (1998) (where\nspecific constitutional guarantee does not apply, conduct violates the Fourteenth Amendment if\nirshocks the conscience\").\n54\n\ndismissed.25 Because liability under that provision is contingent upon viable allegations (and.\nultimately, proof) that section 1985 was violated, the Memorandum argues, if the Court accepts\nDefendants arguments against holding them liable under that statute, but see infra, the § 1986\nclaim must fall, too.\nThat is error. Although it is a truism that a claim under § 1986 may not go forward\nabsent a viable section 1985 claim (because liability is premised on defendant's neglect in\nallowing a § 1985 conspiracy to succeed), it is no less well established that a defendant may be\nheld accountable, under section 1986 for failing to have prevented a civil rights conspiracy in\nwhich it was not a participant.  Peck v. United States. 470 F. Supp. 1003,1012 (S.D.N.Y. 1979);\naccord Platskv v. Kilpatrick. 780 F. Supp. 110,113 (E.D.N.Y. 1991); see generally Hampton.\n600 F.3d at 629. Thus, dismissal of Count XII could only be appropriate if the PBA showed that\nthe complaint does not state a viable claim of any. Section 1985 conspiracy - against any\nDefendants - including the police officers who hurled racial epithets against Mr. Louima as they\nsavagely beat him.26\n-S42 U.S.C. § 1986 provides that:\nEvery person who, having knowledge that any of the wrongs conspired to be done,\nand mentioned in section 1985 of this title, are about to be committed, and having\npower to prevent or aid in preventing the commission of the same, neglects or refuses\nso to do, if such wrongful act be committed, shall be liable to the party injured, or his\nlegal representatives, for all damages caused by such wrongful  act, which such\nperson by reasonable diligence could have prevented\n26Moreover, a defendant  may be held accountable under  §1986 for failing  to prevent\naccomplishment of any Section. 1985 conspiracy, including those for which no proof of race- or\nclass-based animus is required.  See Kush v. Rutledpe. 460 U.S. 719, 726 (1983) (\"it is clear that\nCongress did not intend to impose a requirement of class-based animus on persons seeking to prove\n55\n\nThe PBA, wisely, does not even attempt that demonstration - nor does the Memorandum\nargue in any way that the complaint fails adequately to plead the other elements of section 1986\nliability, that Defendants allowed injuries to be inflicted that they could have, in the exercise of\ndue care, prevented. Clark v. Clabaueh. 20 F.3d 1290 (3rd Cir. 1994) (proof of negligence\nsuffices to establish liability under § 1986):. Park v. Citv of Atlanta. 120 F.3d 1157 (1 l'h Cir.\n1997). Even if knowledge Wiese acquired in the course of the abuse of Mr. Louima is not\nimputed to his principal, as ordinary principles of agency law would provide, see In re Mediators.\nInc.. 105 F.3d 822, 827 (2nd Cir. 1997), it is undeniable that he came to act in this case as a PBA\nagent  \"soon thereafter,\" see supra, and the complaint similarly makes clear that still higher\nranking PBA officials became aware (to understate matters significantly) of the conspirators'\nplan to maintain Mr. Louima under custody as a criminal suspect and deter him (and others) from\ngiving truthful testimony to investigators and from seeking redress for his injuries. Furthermore,\nit is readily apparent from the complaint's other allegations that the conspiracies would have\nbeen less successful in damaging Mr. Louima had the PBA not undertaken to interfere with its\nmembers' doing their legal duty - or, indeed, if the PBA's own police officer/agents, upon\na violation of their rights under the first clause of Section 1985(2)\").\nAlthough, in recently amending their complaint, Plaintiffs inadvertently neglected to alter\nthe wording of Count XII so as to state unambiguously that the PBA is being sued for failing to\nprevent any of the § 1985 conspiracies -  and not merely those pleaded under § 1985(3) - the full\nbreadth of Plaintiffs' theory of recovery should be apparent from the body of the complaint, and.\ngiven the facts of this case, any claim by Defendants to have been prejudiced by this typographical\nerror should be met with considerable skepticism. ££. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15. As is made clear above.\nDefendants'  contentions  concerning the  §  1985 and  §  1986 claims  that the complaint  does\nunambiguously plead are decidedly cursory, and an assertion that they would have proceeded\ndifferently on § 1986 had there been no clerical oversight must be evaluated in the light of those\npatently flawed arguments. If the Court deems doing so the appropriate course, Plaintiffs will seek\nleave formally to amend the complaint with this correction.\n56\n\nAlthough § 1985(3) accords a remedy to a person \"injured in his person or property ... as a\nresult of the conspiracy to intimidate or retaliate,\"(Le., a § 1985(2) conspiracy) the \"gist-of the\nwrong at which $ 1985(2) is directed.\" the Court explained, \"is not deprivation of property, but\nintimidation or retaliation against witnesses in federal-court proceedings.\"27  Precisely like the\nplaintiff in Haddle, Mr. Louima seeks compensation from Defendants for injuries to his\n\"person,\" e^g., emotional distress, inflicted as part of the Section 1985(2) conspiracy.  Whether or\nnot he has a protectable interest in the outcome of these proceedings - or a constitutional right to\nbe free from these acts, cf. Paul v. Davis.424 U.S.693 (1976)) -  Haddle teaches, the answers are\nnot relevant to the § 1985 inquiry.\nThe decisions cited by the PBA as supporting its position are beside the point — even\nwhen judged according to the already relaxed standards of relevance prevailing in the rest of the\nMemorandum.  Even if it were true that the PBA's actions were intended exclusively to benefit\nthe officers in their federal criminal trials - and in no way contemplated civil litigation with Mr.\nLouima, see Memorandum at 20 (\"to the extent that plaintiffs seek redress for acts designed to\nprotect guilty officers from punishment, there is no pleading of injury to Louima\") -  section\n1985(2) would proscribe conspiracies to \"deter, by force, intimidation, or threat, any party or\nwitness in any court of the United States from attending such court, or from testifying to any\nmatter pending therein, freely, fully, and truthfully,\" and holds liable \"persons engaged in such a\nconspiracy [who] do or cause to be done, anv act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy,\nwhereby another is injured in his person or property.\"  § 1985(2), (3) (emphasis supplied).  Sge\n-7As the Supreme Court explained, § 1985(3) specifies  the remedy provision for all the\nvarious conspiracies prohibited in the three subsections of the provision.  525 U.S. at 125 n.2.\n58\n\nlearning of the atrocities, had done their own official duties as police officers and reported\nmisconduct.  As the complaint details, Defendants did none of this, opting instead, to appear at\nroll calls urging union members - in defiance of their official duty and, in certain instances,\nagainst their own penal interests - to maintain silence. Cf. 1J164\nB. The Complaint Adequately Pleads Injury Under Section 1985\nDefendants also argue - indeed it is the only argument advanced in support of their\nmotion to dismiss Count XI (which challenges PBA efforts to impede the due course of justice in\nfederal courts) - that Mr. Louima has inadequately alleged \"injury,\" on the ground that the only\ninterest the complaint asserts is in having the culpable individual defendants criminally\nprosecuted.  Because \"a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or\nnon-prosecution of another,\" the Memorandum insists, id. at 23 (quoting Silverstein v. Barnes.\n1986 WL 4525, affd, 798 F.2d 467 (2nd Cir. 1986)), Mr. Louima's § 1985 claims should fail.\nThis argument would be facially implausible under any circumstances -  it is so contrary\nto the plain language of § 1985 - but it is especially ineffective in the wake of the Supreme\nCourt's unanimous decision in Haddle v. Garrison. 525 U.S. 121 (1998), which expressly\nrejected the argument that for § 1985 purposes, plaintiffs must state an injury to a constitutionally\ncognizable interest.  Reversing lower court rulings that a  § 1985(2) plaintiff s claim that his at-\nwill employment had been terminated in retribution for his having testified in a federal trial did\nnot state the sort of \"injury\" required to maintain a cause of action under that statute  (because\nthere is no arguable liberty or property interest in continued at-will employment), Chief Justice\nRehnquist explained that the plain meaning of the statute's text foreclosed such a reading.\n57\n\nid (\"[Tjhe party so injured\"may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such\ninjury . ..  against any one or more of the conspirators\") (emphases supplied). Thus, not only\nmay Mr. Louima sue for damage done as part of the effort to prevent him from testifying, \"as a\nwitness\" -just as the plaintiff in Haddle could sue based on retaliation for having testified in a\n\"federal criminal trial,\" 525 U.S. at 122 -  without showing that he has a \"legally protectable\ninterest,\" in a conviction, he may also hold the PBA liable for any damage to his property,\nincluding a cause of action, that has been done as part of the federal conspiracy.  See Barrett. 798\nF.2d at 575. Haddle leaves no room for Defendants' argument that Mr. Louima can go forward\nonly by showing that destroying his person or property (and not exculpating the officers) was the\nspecific objective (or \"design\" Memorandum at 20) of the conspiracy.  C£ Gonsalves. 939 F.\nSupp. at 927 (noting that \"cover-up may also have had other objectives, such as preventing\ncriminal prosecution\").\nC.  The Complaint Adequately Alleges PBA Involvement in Section 1985(3)\nConspiracies and the Section 1985(2) Conspiracy to Impede the Due Course\nof State Justice\n1. The Complaint's Allegations of Class-Based Animus Are Sufficient\nWhile the foregoing shows that the complaint states viable claims under both Sections\n1986 and 1985(2) (ones for which evidence of racial animus by the PBA is undeniably\nunnecessary) - the Memorandum's assumption that the animus requirement means that onlv\nthose participants who have joined Section 1985(3) deprivation conspiracies for racially\nmotivated reasons is mistaken. In Bell v. City of Milwaukee. 746 at 1259-60, the Court of\nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit held that it is the character of the conspiracy - and not the\n59\n\nindividual's state of mind - that determines whether a conspiracy participant can be held liable\nunder § 1985(3).  Rejecting an appellant's argument that he could not be held liable under §\n1985(3) without individualized proof of specific racial animus on his part, the court ruled that\n\"racial animus of a key conspiratorial actor who initiates and maintains the conspiracy is\nsufficient to establish conspiracy racial animus under Section 1985.\" Yeadon v. New York Citv\nTrans. Auth. 719 F. Supp. 204, 212 (S.D.N.Y.1989), is to similar effect.  In that case, supervisor\ndefendants who participated, as the PBA is alleged to, in a racially motivated conspiracy were\nheld legally accountable for involvement, without any apparent claim that their participation had\nthe same motivation.  Accord Green v. Francis. 705 F.2d 846 (6th Cir. 1983) (police defendants\nliable under section 1985 for failure to intercede in race-based conspiracy).28\n2. The PBA Is Liable For Hindering The Provision of Equal Protection\nEven if Defendants were right that absence of proof that their own participation was\nracially motivated would defeat a claim based on § 1985(3)'s \"Deprivation\" clause, see Griffin v.\nBreckenridge. 403 U.S. 88 (1971), finally, that would not be grounds for dismissing Count IX,\nwhich alleges violation of the second clause of Section 1985(3), proscribing conspiracy \"for the\npurpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any State or Territory from\ngiving or securing to all persons within such State or Territory the equal protection of the laws\"\n(emphasis supplied). That provision, whose terms aptly describe the PBA's systematic efforts to\n28These decisions are wholly consistent with basic principles of civil liability. To the extent\nthat § 1985(3) is understood to reflect a congressional judgment that racially motivated or other\nclass-based conspiracies are especially pernicious, no principle of law or equity suggests that an\nindividual who energetically  devotes himself to the success of that conspiracy  should  not be\naccountable to the conspiracy's victim, on the ground that he was motivated by different (but still\nundeniably anti-social) purposes.\n60\n\nassure that even the most culpable police officers are not brought to justice, has not been\nconstrued authoritatively to impose a class-based animus requirement.  See Brav v. Alexandria\nWomen's Health Clinic. 506 U.S. 263, 281 (1993); id at 289-90 (Souter, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part); Town of West Hartford v. Operation Rescue, 991 F.2d 1039 (2nd Cir.\n1993), and, as the facts of this case well illustrates, such a limitation would be neither necessary\nnor appropriate.\nWhile the Supreme Court has held that class-based animus is an element of a claim under\nthe \"deprivation\" clause of §1985(3), the Court's opinions have been explicit in recognizing that\nthat requirement derives not from the statutory text but from a pragmatic need to assure that §\n1985(3) does not federalize what would otherwise be ordinary tort suits. See Griffin. 403 U.S.. at\n102. Although this need to keep Section 1985(3) within manageable limits - particularly in cases\nof \"purely private conspiracies.\" see Griffin. 403 U.S. at 104 (noting perceived constitutional\ndifficulties in regulating private party conduct) - is broadly consistent with concerns expressed\nby the statute's drafters, there is no similar need for such extra-textual limitation for claims under\nthe prevention clause, see Brav, 506 U.S. at 301 (Souter, J., concurring and dissenting),  and it\nwould be especially inappropriate to impose one to defeat a claim, such as Mr. Louima's, that so\ndeeply implicates the original purposes and plain meaning of the statute.  See Brav. 506 U.S. at\n348 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (noting that the \"requirement of class-based animus is a\nreasonable shorthand description of the type of actions the 42d Congress was attempting to\naddress\" but cautioning that \"that shorthand description\" should not be allowed to \"take on a life\nof its own\"): but see Libertad v. Welch. 53 F.3d 428 (lsl Cir. 1995) (imposing animus\nrequirement in prevention clause case); Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood. Inc. v. Doe. 836 F.\n61\n\nSupp. 939 (N.D.N.Y. 1993) (same).29\nThe only rationale advanced for importing a racial animus requirement into the\nprevention clause - the presence of \"equal protection\" language in the statute - is deeply flawed.\nFirst, there is powerful evidence that the statute's framers did not understand the phrase \"equal\nprotection of the laws\" as limited to refraining from reliance on classifications that modern\ndoctrine treats as \"suspect,\" see Earl A. Maltz, The Concept of Equal Protection of the Laws- An\nHistorical Inquiry. 22 SAN DIEGO L. REV. 499, 537 (1985); Steven J. Heyman, The First Dutv of\nGovernment: Protection. Liberty and the Fourteenth Amendment. 41 DUKEL. J. 507 (1991), and\nthe legislative history cited in Briscoe firmly establishes that organized efforts to frustrate the\noperations of the criminal justice system were a core concern of those who enacted § 1985(3).\nSee 460 U.S. at 338 (\"It is clear from the legislative debates that, in the view of the Act's\nsponsors, the victims of Klan outrages were deprived of'equal protection of the laws if the\nperpetrators systematically went unpunished.'\").  Moreover, even under current doctrine,\nselective withholding of governmental protection - when improperly motivated - states an Equal\nProtection claim. Village of Willowbrook v. Olech. 120 S. Ct. 1073 (2000) (per curiam): LeClair\nv. Saunders 627 F.2d 606,609-10 (2nd Cir. 1980) (a selective treatment claim may be premised\nupon intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith\nintent to injure a person); Dwares. 985 F.2d at 99 (police refusal to protect flag burners violates\n29As Justice Souter's opinion explained, the text of the Prevention Clause - like those other\nprovisions of Section 1985 that have been held not to require class-based animus, see Kush - is, by\nits nature limited to conduct closely bound up with state action, id. at 301 (\"the act of frustrating or\nthwarting state officials in their exercise of the State's police power would amount simply to an\nextralegal way of determining how that state power would be exercised\").\n62\n\nsever the liability of the original tort-feasor but... [t]hat doctrine has no\napplication when the intentional or criminal intervention of a third party or parties\nis reasonably foreseeable.  When the intervening, intentional act of another is\nitself the foreseeable harm that shapes the duty imposed, the defendant who fails\nto guard against such conduct will not be relieved of liability when that act occurs.\n(citations omitted): see also Derdiarian v. Felix Contracting Corp. 51 N.Y.2d 308,434 N.Y.S.2d\n166 (1980), (\"liability turns upon whether the intervening act is a normal or foreseeable\nconsequence of the situation created by the defendant's negligence\"): City of Birmingham v.\nBenson. 631 So.2d 902 (Ala. 1993) (applying principle in concluding that bouncer could be\nliable for homicide committed by bar's customer because \"he should have realized the likelihood\n... that a third person might avail himself of the opportunity to commit such a tort or crime\"); c£\nDwares. 985 F.2d at 99 (\"it requires no stretch to infer that [police's] prior assurances [that\ndefendants would not be arrested] increased the likelihood that the 'skinheads' would assault the\ndemonstrators\").\nIndeed, it was precisely this principle that led courts to rule for the defendant in the two\ncases Defendants cite, Heredia and Sheehan. Although the defendant in Heredia could be\nconsidered negligent (for having lent his car, in violation of an administratively imposed duty) he\ncould not be held accountable in tort, because the intervening conduct (negligent driving) was not\nforeseeable.  In other words, \"the defendant's conduct was part of the causal chain of events\nleading to the injury but the resulting injury could not have been reasonably anticipated by the\ndefendant.\"  Benson. 631 So.2d at 907.\nNor. as noted above, can Defendants properly analogize this case to Lizzi.  In that case\nthe intervening tort arguably was a foreseeable consequence of the union defendant's actions, but\n64\n\nEqual Protection); cf, Evans v. Romer. 517 U.S. 620 (1996). A regime that denies equal rights\nand remedies to those seeking redress for police-inflicted violence - or a systematic effort to\nundermine the State's provision of equal rights - is an affront to these same principles.30\nV.  The Complaint States Common Law Claims Against the PBA and the Individual\nDefendants\nA. The Complaint Adequately Pleads A Cause of Action For Negligence\nDefendants argue that Count XVI, Mr. Louima's claim for common law negligence, fails\nfor the same reasons as do Counts XIV and XV, his claims of systematic wrongdoing in violation\nof the federal civil rights laws: because a party whose conduct \"creates an atmosphere\" where\nviolence flourishes cannot be held liable for acts of violence that actually occur.  See\nMemorandum at 27 (citing Heredia. 887 F. Supp. at 83).\nBut the PBA is no more right about causation under the common law than under § 1983.\nIn Kush bv Marszalek v. Citv of Buffalo. 59 N.Y.2d 26 (1983), the New York Court of Appeals\nexplained the causation showing required under State common law.  Answering a school\ndistrict's argument that it could not be held liable in negligence when the plaintiffs injury\nresulted from an intervening  crime or intentional tort - the theft of dangerous chemicals from\nschool premises - the Court explained:\nDefendant is correct that an intervening intentional or criminal act will generally\n\"Indeed, a policy that provides rights and remedies to victims of violent acts based on\nwhether or not the attacker was a police officer should not survive even \"rational basis\" Equal\nProtection review.  See Citv of Orange. 157 F.3d at 74 (policy of refusing to prosecute cross-\ncomplaints does not satisfy \"rational basis\" standard); Navarro v. Block. 72 F.3d 712,717 (9th Cir.\n1995) (holding that even when policy of differential treatment of domestic violence victims is not\nmotivated by discriminatory intent, it may still be challenged as lacking a rational basis).\n63\n\nthe court held that the union's conduct should not be considered negligent.  Although its pursuit\nof a grievance on behalf of the wrongdoer was the but-for cause of plaintiff s injury, Lizzi\nexplained, it would have been \"fatuous,\" to hold the union accountable for having done its duty\nas a union, i.e.. representing a member of the bargaining unit in a grievance proceeding.  But the\nMemorandum reads that decision for far more than it is worth, u^, as if it announced (1) that anv\nunion action that is intended to advance the interests of bargaining unit members is similarly\nprivileged and (2) that (because the union's legal duty to its member was found in that particular\ncase to be stronger than any general obligation to prevent harm) unions can never be held liable\nto members of the public for the consequences of negligence.31 Neither of these conclusions is\nsupportable; indeed, Defendants' arguments are refuted by cases imposing common law duties\non unions (1) for creating dangerous situations and tolerating lawless actions, see Browne: (2) for\ninducing or encouraging members to ignore their duties to the public, Bovle v. Anderson Fire\nFighters Ass'n Local 1262. AFL-CIO. 497 N.E.2d 1073 (Ind. App. 2 Dist.1986), and (3) for\nviolating statutes in a way that causes private harm,  Caso v. District Council 37. AFSCME. 350\nN.Y.S.2d 173 (A.D. 1973) (upholding right of general public to collect damages on nuisance\ntheory); Burns Jackson Miller. 464 N.Y.S.2d at 720 (affirming availability of nuisance remedy\nand holding that Taylor law was not meant to pre-empt common law tort actions for damages\ncaused by union's illegal activities).32 The duty of individual police officers to report instances\n3lThe only claims in Lizzi concerned the union's action vis-a-vis its members: an important\naspect of Count XVI involves the union's relationship with its agents, i.e.. its neglgient failure to\ntrain them in a way that enables them to continue to discharge their duties as peace officers.\n32The PBA does not have available to it the defense that helped the union escape common\nlaw liability in Burns Jackson.  Unlike in that case, Mr. Louima's injuries are not comparable in\nkind and degree to those suffered by the general public.\n65\n\nof violence is a ministerial one, see Boyle (municipal firefighters have nondiscretionary duty to\nfight fires), and therefore imposes a duty to individual members of the general public, one with\nwhich Defendants may not tortiously interfere.33\nB. The Complaint Adequately Pleads Intensional Infliction of Emotional Distress\nThe PBA also insists that the complaint fails to state a claim for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, arguing that because the ultimate purpose of Defendants' campaign against\nMr. Louima was not to cause him harm, but rather to help the individual police officers avoid\ncriminal prosecution, there exists no set of facts that could establish the requisite \"intent.\"\nMemorandum at 28.  Even if this were an accurate reading of the complaint, the PBA cites no\nauthority as support for the theory that New York law exempts from liability those who\nknowingly and intentionally cause harm, so long as they can show that, in doing so, they had an\nulterior (if equally improper) motive. No such authority exists. Instead - and directly contrary to\nthe PBA's assertions that a cause of action will only lie where infliction of harm is the sole\npurpose of the misconduct - New York courts, consistently with the Restatement (Second) of\nTorts, have recognized that recklessness, Le^, indifference to the likelihood that severe emotional\nharm will ensue suffices to satisfy the \"intent\" element of the tort.  See Dana v. Oak Park Marina.\nInc.. 230 A.D.2d 204,209,660 N.Y.S.2d 906, 910 (4th Dep't 1997) (holding that liability can be\nestablished by showing \"disregard of a substantial probability of causing [] severe emotional\ndistress\"); see id. (citing similar precedent from other departments).\n33As in Bovle. the activities of the union and its members are uniquely affected with the\npublic safety, and when the union undertakes to help determine how a criminal investigation occurs,\nit is assumes a duty, imposed by traditional tort principles, not to heighten the dangers faced by third\nparties.\n66\n\nNor is there anything to the PBA's argument that the complaint's intentional infliction\nclaim is actually one for defamation in disguise, sge Memorandum.at 28-29, and must be\ndismissed for reasons specific to defamation law. Yet again, the controlling New York law is\ndirectly to the contrary.  Whether intentional infliction is, as Defendants insist, a disfavored\nclaim, the Appellate Division in Esposito-Hilder v. SFX Broadcasting. Inc.. 665 N.Y.S.2d 697,\n699 (3rd Dep't 1997) considered and rejected the specific argument that there can be no cause of\naction for infliction of distress where the same conduct (in that case, an insulting and\nembarrassing radio broadcast) would give rise to a defamation claim.  Upholding the viability of\nthe distinct intentional infliction claim - even in circumstances where the defamation claim could\nnot go forward - the court quoted the Court of Appeals' observation that \"[t]he tort is as limitless\nas the human capacity for cruelty. The price for this flexibility in redressing utterly reprehensible\nbehavior, however, is a tort that, by its terms, may overlap with other areas of the law, with\npotential liability for conduct that is otherwise lawful.\"  665 N.Y.S. 2d at 700 (quoting Howell v.\nNew York Post. 81 N.Y.2d 115,122 [1993]); see also id. (noting that Court of Appeals had\nspecifically rejected argument that intentional infliction claim may never be used as \"end around\"\nlimitations of overlapping tort). Esposito-Hilder finally cited other appellate decisions that had\nimplicitly taken the same position: in Cohen v. Feiden. the court noted, the Second Department\nhad considered separately (though ultimately rejected on the merits) an emotional distress claim\ngrounded on precisely the same \"ill-chosen remarks to parties in... a custody proceeding\" as\nwas plaintiffs defamation suit.\nFinally, to the extent that the Defendants assert that the intentional infliction claim is\nbarred by the statute of limitations, that is an affirmative defense, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c), which\n67\n\nthe complaint is not required to anticipate.  But the PBA's argument is devoid of merit in any\nevent.  First, Federal Rule 15(c)(2) specifically provides that an amended pleading relates back to\nthe date of the original pleading when \"the claim .. .arose out of the conduct, transaction, or\noccurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.\"  Here, the initial\ncomplaint, filed within the one year limitations period, alleged that there had been a campaign to\ndefame and publicly humiliate Mr. Louima, see ffi[ 140-47, and put the PBA on notice that it was\nbeing sued for its post-attack conduct toward him. The statute of limitations cannot be invoked\nto penalize Mr. Louima for not having learned soon enough that there had been a secret,\nconspiratorial meeting in the precinct basement or that the PBA, through Wiese, Immitt, and\npossibly others had orchestrated that meeting — facts that emerged for the first time in a criminal\ntrial heard earlier this year.  See Keating v. Carev. 706 F.2d 377 (2nd Cir. 1983) (if defendant has\nconcealed facts that are critical to a cause of action, the statute of limitations is tolled); Barrett.\n689 F.2d at 329-30 (a plaintiff with knowledge of one claim, but deprived of information critical\nto another is entitled to tolling in that claim).\nBut even if the first complaint had less fully put Defendants (who have known all along\nthat, inter alia, the meeting took place), the amended complaint makes clear that the PBA's\nDefendants' actions are not a thing of the distant past: see Iffl109,132 (alleging, respectively,\nthat \"defendants' efforts to conceal the truth continue to the detriment of Mr. Louima,\"\nand that\" the PBA continues to deter and discourage\" truthful testimony).  See Neufeld v.\nNeufeld. 910 F. Supp. 977,983 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (noting the under New York law, ''certain\nwrongs are considered to be continuous wrongs, and the statute of limitations, therefore, runs\nfrom the commission of the last wrongful act.\"); Dana. 660 N.Y.S.2d at 910 (continuous tort\n68\n\ndoctrine applies in reckless infliction\ncases).\n1. The Complaint Adequately States Claims Against Defendants Immitt and Lee\nAnd On Behalf of Plaintiff Micheline Louima\nOn the last two pages of their Memorandum, Defendants attempt to sneak officers Immitt\nand Lee out of the case. First, Defendants insist that the complaint alleges.\nin conclusory fashion... that Immitt and Lee sought to deter individual officers\nfrom coming forward, to intimidate any officers who did come forward and to\npublicize to the perpetrators and other police officers the names of individuals\nthought to be cooperating in the investigation.  Immitt is later alleged to have\ninvoked a privilege concerning communication with union members. Compl. If 77\nEven without fully correcting for Defendants' penchant for selective summarization - the\nlast-cited paragraph also alleges that Immitt pleaded the Fifth Amendment when his assenion of\nprivilege was overruled and is followed by an allegation that what testimony he did give was\nperjurious - plaintiffs contention that such allegations are somehow impermissibly \"conclusory\"\nis essentially self-refuting.  To the extent that the PBA implies that such factual allegations(not to\nmention the ones the Memorandum leaves unmentioned) do not comport with the requirement\nthat Immitt and Lee be given fair notice as to the nature of the claims against them, then it is the\nMemorandum that \"departs from [the] reality\" of what the Federal Rules require. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n8(a).\nThe remainder of the Memorandum's arguments on behalf of Lee and Immitt incorporate\nby reference the arguments already made in support of dismissing claims against the PBA.\nThose arguments do not fare any better for the individuals than for the union.  Indeed, they fare\n69\n\nworse. There is even less difficulty in finding the actions of Immitt and Lee, both of whom are\nNew York police officers, to have been \"under color of law,\" and the PBA's arguments\nconcerning \"respondeat superior,\" and union privilege - however spurious when advanced on\nbehalf of the union - are, of their own terms, inapplicable to these individual defendants.34\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reason, Plaintiffs Abner and Micheline Louima respectfully request that\nthe Motion of the PBA et al. to dismiss be denied in its entirety.\nRespectfully submitted,\nCOCHRAN NEUFELD & SCHECK, LLP\n99 Hudson Street, 8th Floor\nNew YorJcrNY 10013\n(917)2?\nBy:.\nPETER J.

Did Officer Weise at some point during his description of\n4 these events describe Officer Volpe in a certain way?\n5 A.  Yes.\n6 Q.  What did he say?\n7 A.  When he -- when Officer Weise was explaining to us what\n8 he observed in the bathroom he described Volpe as half a\n9 fucking nut.  Half a fucking nut.\n10 Q.  According to Officer Weise, what happened after he and\n11 his partner arrived at the hospital?\n12 A.  Weise describes at the hospital there's officers coming\n13 in and they're basically getting triage, which is they're seen\n14 by some hospital staff, some nurses, and they get treated and\n15 there's paperwork involved.  There's a lot of paperwork .\n16 involved and Weise describes he is the P.B.A. delegate, union\n17 delegate and part of his role is to take care of the officers,\n18 make sure the paperwork is done right and that they get proper\n19 medical care, that they are treated well by the hospital and\n20 whatnot.\n21 He.describes as the group of officers are waiting\n22 around to be seen by doctors or treated for any injuries\n23 they're basically telling war stories and they're shooting the\n24 breeze, so to speak.\n25 Q.  According to Officer Weise, does he have a particular\nM. BRYMER, RPR, OCR\n\no-ao\nBurns-direct/Vinegrad\n1 conversation with Officer Volpe regarding the events in the\n2 station house?\n3 A.  Yes.\n4 Q.  Who says what?\n5 A.  If I may refresh?\n6 Q.  Yes.\n7 A.  Weise informs us that Volpe has a conversation with him\n8 in the hospital where he basically says to Weise, Tom, I got a\n9 little carried away, you know, things like that.  He later\n10 says that he made a guy shit his pants or he made the guy shit\n11 his pants, that's the second guy I made shit his pants.\n12 Q.  According to Officer Weise, that's what Officer Volpe\n13 tells Weise in the hospital?\n14 A.  In the hospital, correct.\n15 Q.  What, if anything, does Officer Weise say in response to\n16 Officer Volpe, after Volpe tells him I got a little carried\n17 away?\n18 A.  Weise describes having sort of counseled him and said to\n19 Volpe maybe you should get off patrol, maybe you shouldn't be\n20 dealing with people and go talk to your brother Damion Volpe,\n21 who was also at that time a P.B.A. delegate in the 70\n22 Precinct, and maybe Damion for whatever contacts he has could\n23 get you off patrol where you're not interacting with people.\n24 Q.  According to Officer Weise, what was Officer Volpe doing\n25 after that in the hospital?\nM. BRYMER, RPR, OCR\n\nIrani 11 - direct /Vinegrad\nA.  Correct.\nQ.  It was not working on behalf of IAB that's conducting the\ninvestigation, correct?\nA.  Correct.\nQ.  You were representing these three defendants; is that\nfair?\nA. Yes.\n8 Q.  Now, when did you first learn that IAB was conducting an\ninvestigation into the sexual assault of Abner Louima?\n10 A.  At the time I learned it I didn't know it was a sexual\n11 assault.\n12 Q.  When did you first learri that IAB was conducting an\n13 investigation into an assault of Abner Louima?\n14 A.  I had gotten a phone call that there was an investigation\n15 at the 70.\n16 Q.  Who did you get that phone call from, sir?\n17 A.  Thomas Wiese.\n18 Q.  When was that?\n2\n19 A.  To the best of my recollection, I think it was a Monday.\n2\n20 I don't know the exact date.\n2:\n21 Q.  You think it was a Monday?\n23\n22 A.  I think.\n24\n23 Q.  What did Officer Wiese say to you and what did you say t<\n25\n24 him?\n25 A.  He just told me there was some kind of an investigation\nM. BRYMER, RPR, O<\n\n1820\nSchwarz-direct/Fischetti\n1 that this prisoner is now in the hospital.  Yes, that did\n2 concern me.\n3 Q  When you heard about the fact they were looking for\n4 sticks, broom sticks, does that mean anything to you at that\n5 time?\n6 A  At that point I assumed that maybe they were\n7 investigating that he was beaten with a broke stick or a mop\n8 handle.\n9 Q  Did you leave the precinct after your meal?\n10 A  Yes.\n11 Q  Where did you go?\n12 A  We were assigned to what they call, I believe it was\n13 assigned to sensitivity —  I would have to look at the memo\n14 book to see.\n15 But it was a condition we had there were various\n16 locations that we were assigned to go and check on.  Make sure\n17 there is nothing unusual.\n18 Locations such as mosques, churches synagogues, I\n19 think Brooklyn College was on the list.\n20 Q  Did you go to Brooklyn college?\n21 A  Yes.\n22 Q  Did you make any phone calls at Brooklyn college?\n23 A  Yes. ••\n24 Q  Tell us what phone calls were made and who made them and\n25 what was said to the best of your recollection?\nMichael Picozzi, RPR, official Court Reporter\n\n1821\nSchwarz-direct/Fischetti\n1 A To the best of my recollection we drove to Brooklyn\n2 College.  We were concerned Tommy and I about what we had\n3 learned in the precinct.  And I parked the car and Tommy said\n4 he wanted to call Thomas Bruder to let him now there was an IA\n5 investigation related to the arrest we brought in that night.\n6 Q Did he tell you why he wanted to call Tommy?\n7 A Wanted to let him know there was an investigation going\n8 on »\n9 Q Did he say anything about being a delegate?\n10 A Tommy was a delegate and as a delegate that is part of\n11 his responsibilities.\n12 Q Does he use your phone card?\n13 A Yes,  what happened was neither one of us had change so I\n14 gave Thomas Wiese my phone call.\n15 Q Did you hear his conversation?\n16 A No.\n17 Q Did you make any phone calls?\n18 A Yes.\n19 Q Who did you call?\n20 A I called Anthony Abbate.\n21 Q Who is Anthony Abbate and his relationship to you?\n22 A Anthony Abbate is a friend of mine.  We worked together\n23 in the 70tli- Precinct.\n24 Before I got in the anti-crime unit I worked the 4:00\n25 to 12:00 shift, which is 3:00 p.m. to I think 11:35 at night.\nMichael Picozzi, RPR, Official Court Reporter\n\nSchwarz-direct/Fischetti\n1 We worked on the same shift.  He was also a PBA delegate for\n2 the precinct.\n3 Q  Why did you call him?\n4 A  I was very concerned.  Anthony is a good friend of mine\n5 minimum, a very experienced delegate.  I had some concerns I\n6 wanted to talk to him about it.  I wanted to talk to somebody\n7 that was removed from this, that wasn't associated with this\n8 in any way that could give me an objective non-biased opinion\n9 or viewpoint.\n10 And some of the concerns I. had was primarily all\n11 those people in Internal Affairs in the precinct obviously\n12 thought it had to be something serious.\n13 My immediate concern was they were going to place me\n14 on modified assignment.  Usually when you get placed on\n15 modified assignment you work the day tour hours.  I was\n16 concerned because it would interfere with my responsibilities\n17 I had at home.\n18 I was also concerned about I had an application in\n19 with the Police Department Emergency Service Unit.\n20 Q  Is that an elite unit?\n21 A  Yes, within the Police Department they receive a lot of\n22 specialized training.  I was informed a couple of weeks prior\n23 I was going % to have an interview with them.\n24 My concerns were, obviously I was concern about the\n25 prisoner I brought in was in the hospital.\nMichael Picozzi, RPR, Official Court Reporter\n\n**~  I was concerned they would placed me on^modlfy. duty\nand interfere with my responsibilities and I was concerned it\nwas going to affect my interview with emergency services.\nQ  At that particular point, on August 11th, and the\ntelephone call with Anthony Abbate, did you have any knowledge\nto the extent of Abner Louima's injuries?\nA  No.\n8  Q  Did you have any knowledge of the fact that he was\nsexually assaulted in the bathroom?\n10  A  No.\n11  Q  None whatsoever?\n12  A  None.\n13  Q  What, if anything, if you recall did Anthony Abbate say\n14  with regard to your conversation with him and your concerns?\n15  A  He didn't say much.  He mainly listened to me and he just\n16  said to me:  You know, it does sound like it's something\n17  serious and that is a serious investigation.  And he told me\n18  that I should probably seek some type of legal counsel.\n19  Q  Were you the only person that spoke to Mr. Abbate on that\n20  phone call from your phone card?\n21  A  No.\n22  Q  Who else did?\n23  A  After I- spoke to him, Tommy spoke to him.\n24  Q  Did you hear the conversation between Tommy and\n25  Mr. Abbate at that time?\nMichael Picozzi, RPR, Official Court Reporter",
