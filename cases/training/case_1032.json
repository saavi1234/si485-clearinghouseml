Plaintiff sought monetary and injunctive relief. The complaint was amended on October 16, 2001.</p><p>On January 8, 2002, the parties agreed to a partial dismissal of certain individually named officer defendants.  The case remained pending against Westchester County and one individual officer, who then moved for summary judgment on February 7, 2002. On February 22, 2002, plaintiff responded by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p><p>On October 24, 2002, district judge Colleen McMahon issued her memorandum decision, granting in part and denying in part plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment, and granting in part, denying in part defendants' motion for summary judgment.  Judge McMahon ruled that on the record presented the police had probable cause to arrest plaintiff for suspicion of drug related activity and that plaintiff was not subjected to excessive detention, thereby defeating plaintiff's false arrest claim.  The court further held that the defendant officer was not constitutionally justified in ordering a strip search of plaintiff, when there was no particularized reasonable belief that she was secreting drugs or other contraband and that he was not entitled to qualified immunity for his actions.  The court denied Westchester County's motion, finding that there was a factual dispute in the record as to whether the strip search was conducted pursuant to an unconstitutional custom or practice of the County's police department.</p><p>On November 14, 2005, defendants filed a notice of appeal.  The parties then arrived at a settlement and the case was voluntarily dismissed by the parties on January 13, 2003 and defendants' appeal was withdrawn.</p><p></p>",

The  Plaintiff  resides  at  the  above  address  with  her\nmother, Zohira Torres, who is divorced and has been divorced for\nmost of the Plaintiff's  life. The Plaintiff  has resided  at the\nafore-stated address for most of her life.\n14.  The Plaintiff is single.\n15.  The Plaintiff is twenty six years of age.  The Plaintiff's\nbirth date is: 3/9/75.\nf'\n\n16.  The Plaintiff attended Fontbonne Hall Academy in Bayridge,\nBrooklyn, New York.  Prior thereto she attended^the Good Shepherd\nSchool in Marine Park, New York.\n17.  The Plaintiff attended St. John's University and graduated\ntherefrom in 1996.\n18.  Thereafter, the Plaintiff worked as an office manager at\nthe Marine Park Funeral Home for approximately one year [just under\none  year].  Subsequent  thereto,  the  Plaintiff  was  employed  at\nCushman  and  Wakefield  in  the  capacity  as  an  Executive\nAdministrator. She was employed thereat for approximately two years\nfrom September, 1998 through September, 2000.  Because of down-\nsizing, the Plaintiff was let go from her position.\n19.  While attending St. John's University the Plaintiff worked\nat  \"Downtown\",  a  clothing  store  located  at  Bedford  Avenue  and\nAvenue U, in Sheepshead Bay/Marine Park, Brooklyn, New York.\n20.  The incident giving rise to this litigation commenced on\nThursday, April 26, 2 001 at or about 5:45 P.M.  in Tarrytown, New\nYork.\n21.  The Plaintiff and her boy friend, Michael Tricardo and\ntheir  mutual  friend,  Frank  Rossi,  had  traveled  from  Michael\nTricardo's residence in Brooklyn, New York to Tarrytpwn where the\nPlaintiff  believed  that  they  were  going  to  dinner  along  with\nanother  individual known  as \"Gabe\"  [believed  to be  Gabe Name Redacted\n a person whom the Plaintiff did not know.\n22.  Gabe had been at Michael Tricardo's residence [outside of\nit]  and  the  Plaintiff,  Frank  Rossi,  and  Michael  Tricardo  had\nn\n\nfollowed Gabe, in his vehicle, to Tarrytown.\n/\"•>  23.  Upon their arrival in Tarrytown, the Tlaintiff, Michael\nTricardo, and Frank Rossi parked the vehicle, in which they were\ntraveling and which the Plaintiff was driving,  in a lot and the\nPlaintiff and Frank Rossi, upon exiting, went to a cafe, about a\nblock away from the parking area, so that the Plaintiff could go to\nthe bathroom.  The Plaintiff and Frank Rossi left Michael Tricardo\nand Gabe, who was in his vehicle, in the parking area.\n24.  As the Plaintiff and Frank Rossi were returning to the\nparking area, where they had left Michael Tricardo and Gabe, the\nPlaintiff and Frank Rossi were stopped by Police Officers, believed\nto be in the employ of Westchester County.  Both the Plaintiff and\nFrank Rossi had cups of tea [coconut vanilla] and each was directed\nto  place  the  cups  of  tea  on  the  sidewalk.  The  Plaintiff  was\n/\"*\"]  handcuffed.  There was an officer present who displayed a gun. The\nPlaintiff  believes that his name was  \"Ray\"  [known as Ramon  and\nbelieved to be Cuban because he later informed the Plaintiff that\nhe was Cuban]. She was asked her name and where she was from. The\nPlaintiff  identified  herself  and  indicated  that  she  was  from\nBrooklyn.  The Plaintiff asked why she was being stopped and the\nPlaintiff was tapped on the shoulder by one of the officers then\npresent and informed by that officers that it was because \"today\nmust be your unlucky day, sweetheart\".\n25.  The  Plaintiff  was  transported  to  a  location  which  is\nbelieved to be a law enforcement facility.  At that facility, the\nPlaintiff was placed in a room separate from Frank Rossi and from\nO\n\nMichael Tricardo whom the Plaintiff saw was then present when she\nn\nentered  the  facility  to which  she had  been transported.  The\nPlaintiff had been transported to the facility separate from Frank\nRossi and  from Michael Tricardo whom the Plaintiff  did not see\nbeing arrested. The Plaintiff did not see the individual known as\n\"Gabe\" when she first entered the law enforcement facility.\n26.  The Plaintiff was at that Facility for perhaps ten minutes\nwhen  she  and  Frank  Rossi  were  then  taken  to  a  second  law\nenforcement  facility.  Michael  Tricardo  was  transported  to  that\nFacility separate from the Plaintiff and Frank Rossi.\n27.  When Frank Rossi and the Plaintiff entered that second\nfacility, the Plaintiff heard the facility referred to as \"Central\nBooking\" when the telephone was answered by an Officer Doyle.\n28.  Frank Rossi and the Plaintiff were first placed in a cell\nn\nand  remained  handcuffed.  Michael  Tricardo was  brought  into  the\nfacility and the Plaintiff was removed from the cell and placed in\na chair and handcuffed to the chair.\n29.  The Plaintiff could see Frank Rossi and Michael Tricardo.\n30.  The Plaintiff observed that both Frank Rossi and Michael\nTricardo were taken, separately, from that room to another location\nand  returned.  The  Plaintiff  learned  that  each  had  been  strip\nsearched.\n31.  The  Plaintiff  was  informed  that  she  would  be  strip\nsearched when a female officer was available.\n32.  At the facility, the Plaintiff was subjected to a strip\nsearch by a female Officer Beckley. Before she was strip searched,\n\nOfficer Beckley took into her possession the Plaintiff's jewelry [\nn i\nthree rings, two pairs of earrings, a watch and an ankle bracelet].\nThe Plaintiff was made to take off all her outer and under garments\nand was forced to bend over.\n33.  The Plaintiff was returned to a room and placed in a chair\noutside  of  a  cell  [handcuffed].  The  Plaintiff  believes  that\nMichael Tricardo and Frank Rossi were placed in separate cells [one\nin a holding cell and one in cell in another room]. The Plaintiff\nwas  then  taken  into  another  room  and  the  handcuffs  removed.\nEventually, the Plaintiff was taken upstairs and into a room and\nquestioned by a Police Officer Mark Pierro.  Present at the time\nwere Police Officers Beckley and Vinnie Antonucci.  Other officers\nwere also present.\nn\n34.  The  Plaintiff  was  informed  in that  room  that  Michael\nTricardo had been arrested for a drug offense involving ecstacy and\nthat Gabe had been followed for some period of time prior to that\ndate.  The Plaintiff was informed that the drug bust had a value of\none hundred thousand dollars. The Plaintiff was informed that the\nquantity of ecstacy was five thousand tabs or pills [the Plaintiff\ncannot recall the specific word used to describe the substance].\n35.  The  Plaintiff  had  no  knowledge  of  such  and,  when\nquestioned,  made such known to the Officer[s].  When questioned\nabout  a  bag  in  which  some  ecstacy  was  apparently  seized,  the\nPlaintiff  indicated that she did not know what bag the Officers\nwere speaking  about.  The Plaintiff  was asked whether,  if they\n\"dusted  the  bag\",  her  fingerprints  would  be  found  on  it.  The\n\n1\n\"It ,\nPlaintiff indicated \"no\" because she had no idea what bag it was\npy—v  that they were discussing.  The Plaintiff was asked about why she\n1\ni\"\nwas in Tarrytown and the Plaintiff indicated that she and her boy\nIt\nfriend  and  Frank  Rossi were  going  out  to dinner. The  Officers\ni\nindicated, in substance, that such was unusual and questioned the 11\n1 <\nPlaintiff about such particularly that she and her boyfriend were In\nJ 11\ngoing out to dinner with a third person, Frank Rossi. The Plaintiff\nresponded that it was not unusual and that it was \"like 'Three's\nCompany',  backwards\".  The Plaintiff  has known  Frank Rossi and\nMichael  Tricardo  for  many  years  as  persons  in  the  general\nneighborhood where they grew up. It has only been in the last year\nand one half or thereabouts that the Plaintiff and Michael Tricardo\nhave been dating. The Officers asked the Plaintiff about $466.00\nwhich was in her wallet.  The Plaintiff indicated that she needed\n/—t  to buy a birthday gift for Michael Tricardo and she had that money\nfor  that  purpose.  The  Plaintiff  had  just  stopped  receiving\nunemployment  as  a  consequence  of  the  loss  of  her  position  at\nCushman and Wakefield  [because of down sizing]. The Plaintiff had\nbeen  receiving  $385.00  per  week.  The  Officers  also  asked  the\nPlaintiff where Michael Tricardo got his money and the Plaintiff\nindicated that, as far as she knew, Michael Tricardo had received\nsome monies when his father had passed  away approximately  three\nyears ago. The Plaintiff was asked if Michael Tricardo bought her\nextravagant jewelry and the Plaintiff responded that at holidays\nMichael Tricardo has bought her jewelry.  The Plaintiff was asked\nif  she  and  Michael  Tricardo  went  on  a  lot  of  trips  and  the\n\nPlaintiff indicated that they had just gone on a trip to Acapulco.\n(  I  When asked who paid  for the trip, the Plaintiff  indicated  that\nMichael Tricardo had paid for the trip but that she had  brought\nher own monies, as  well. The Officer[s] indicated that they wanted\nto  let  the  Plaintiff  go  and  would  she  sign  a  statement.  The\nPlaintiff indicated she would. The Plaintiff asked did it have to\nbe written or typed. The Officers, in a joking manner, said, \"you\ncan  type?\"  The  Officer[s]  indicated  the  statement  must  be\nhandwritten.  The Plaintiff then wrote a statement out which was\ndictated to the Plaintiff. During the dictation, the Officers made\nreference to the bag, again,  and the Plaintiff refused to write\nsomething about the bag which would have suggested, the way it was\nbeing dictated, that she had knowledge of some bag [which she did\nnot].  The  Officer[]s,  again  in  somewhat  of  a  jovial  manner,\n{  |  stated,  with  respect  to  the  dictation  at  that  point,  \"we're\nkidding, we're kidding\".  The Plaintiff responded that she did not\nhave time for jokes.\n36.  After the statement was dictated to, and written by, the\nPlaintiff, she re-read  it and signed  it and she was required to\nplace a time on it. The Plaintiff recalls  and believes that the\ntime was approximately 8:45  P.M.\n37.  Thereafter,  the  Plaintiff  asked  if  she  could  use  the\nbathroom  and  was  permitted  to  do  so although  a  female  Officer\nobserved the Plaintiff in the bathroom.\n38.  The Plaintiff asked if she could leave.  The Plaintiff\nwas placed in a room and was informed that she would be able to\nMUM*\n\nleave \"soon\".\n—^  39.  The Plaintiff was placed in the room witft an Officer known\nr\nas Roman, the individual whom the Plaintiff previously saw on the\nstreet and who, on the street, was observed by the Plaintiff with\na gun.\n40.  During the course of the period that the Plaintiff was\nwith Ramon,  it was  then that  she  learned  from him  that he was\nCuban.\n41.  He also indicated to the Plaintiff that she did not meet\nthe \"profile\" because of his observation of how the Plaintiff was\nshaking when she was handcuffed on the street.\n42.  The Plaintiff was held  from 8:45  P.M.  to approximately\nmidnight or 12:30 A.M. The Plaintiff would periodically ask when\nshe could leave and was continuously told \"soon\".  The Plaintiff\n/ i asked where the nearest train station was so that she could travel\nback to New York City.\n43.  The Plaintiff did not, however, feel that she was free to\nleave until she was told that she could leave and she was never\ntold that she could leave when she continued to ask when she could\nleave.\n44.  The Plaintiff asked whether Frank Rossi had been arrested.\nThe Plaintiff was informed by the Officer that he did not think so.\n45.  Prior thereto, when the Plaintiff had been in the room\nbeing questioned by Officer Pierro and others, the Plaintiff had\nbeen informed that: \"your boy friend is going away\".\n46.  Prior to the Plaintiff's release, all of her property was\nr-\n\nvouchered/invoiced.\nn <i\n41.  The Plaintiff's pocketbook was returned'as was her jewelry\n[the latter at a different point of time prior to the release].\n48.  The Plaintiff was asked to  ascertain whether all of her\nproperty  was accounted  for and  the Plaintiff, after  a  thorough\nsearch, indicated that a check book insert was missing.  As result,\nthe Plaintiff was taken out of the facility  and brought  to the\nimpounded vehicle [the vehicle in which the Plaintiff had driven to\nTarrytown]. After a serach of the vehicle, the insert could not be\nlocated.  There was  further  discussion  in which  the  Officers\nindicated that, if and when they found the insert, they would mail\nit to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff rejected such offer and wanted\nto continue to look for it. Eventually, the insert was found on a\ndesk. The insert contained the Plaintiff's birth certificate and\no\nsuch was the reason that she was particularly concerned about it\nbecause she needed her birth certificate to look for employment and\nbecause her birth certificate was an otherwise valued document.\n49.  In  the  process  of  leaving,  the  Plaintiff  saw  Michael\nTricardo. Having apparently seen the Plaintiff, Michael Tricardo\nasked if he could say goodbye to the Plaintiff. He was permitted to\ndo  so.  In  addition  and  with  this  consent,  the  Plaintiff  was\npermitted to take his possessions.  It was at this time that the\nPlaintiff received her jewelry back into her possession.\n50.  it was at this point that the Officer Pierro  indicated\nthat he would take the Plaintiff  and Frank Rossi, who was then\nbeing  released,  to  New  York  since  he  had  to  do  something  in\n11\niri\n\nBrooklyn.\n51.  Accordingly,  the  Plaintiff  and  Frank* Rossi  went  with\nOfficer Pierro and Officer Antonucci in a police vehicle and were\ntransported to Brooklyn.\n52.  Shortly after leaving the law enforcement facility, the\nOfficers stopped to get a six pack of Corona beer. Frank Rossi paid\nfor such.  It occurred  in the context of the Officers providing\nFrank  Rossi  and  the  Plaintiff  cigarettes  and  Frank  Rossi\nindicating  that,  if  they  stopped,  he  would  get  a  package  of\ncigarettes so that he could return them to the Officers. At that\npoint, Officer Pierro indicated that he \"could sure use a Corona\"\nand eventually, the Officerfs] stopped the vehicle and Frank Rossi\npurchased cigarettes and a six pack of the Corona beer.\n53.  On the trip to Brooklyn, the Plaintiff and Frank Rossi\neach had one beer and each of the two Officers had two beers.\n54.  During  the  ride,  the  Officers  made  several  comments\nincluding, from Officer Antonucci, that the way the Plaintiff was\nspeaking it sounded as if she was in a \"battering relationship\".\nOfficer Pierro indicated that Michael Tricardo was a bad guy, a\n\"piece of shit\" and an \"anti-Christ\".  Officer Pierro indicated:\n\"how could he bring his 'old lady' to a drug deal\".\n55.  The  officers  indicated  that,  before  they  took  the\nPlaintiff and Frank Rossi home, Frank Rossi was going to show them\nwhere Michael Tricardo lived. Frank Rossi indicated to them that\nthey already had Michael Tricardo's address because they had his\nlicense.\n12\n\n56.  The officers went to the location where Michael Tricardo\ny-—I  lived.  Michael  Tricardo  resides  with  his'*, mother  [at  his\ngrandmother's house], at 2051 East 18th Street, Brooklyn, New York\n11229.\n57.  At about l;30 A.M., the Officers arrived at the residence\nand, when at the door, informed Michael Tricardo's grandmother,\nthat they had a consent from Michael Tricardo to search his room\nand only his room at the premises. The Officers entered and the\nPlaintiff and Frank Rossi remained with the grandmother who lived\non the middle floor of this three floor premises. Michael Tricardo\nand his mother lived on the third floor; and an aunt lived in the\nbasement level. The Officers had a key and believed that the key\nwas to the door to the premises where Michael Tricardo and his\nmother lived. However that key was not the key to the premises and\n/pi  the  Officers  asked  the  grandmother  or  the  aunt  whether  the\nindividual had key. The door was opened and the Officers entered.\n58. The aunt and the aunt's boyfriend went into the premises\nwith  the  Officers.  In  addition,  two  officers  from  the  61st\nPrecinct went  into the premises  as well  apparently  having  been\nnotified of the same.\n59.  Eventually, approximately  one hour  later, the Officers\nexited.  At that time they asked the Plaintiff what she was going\nto do and the Plaintiff indicated that she was going to stay with\nthe grandmother  who was particularly  shaken  by the matter. The\nOfficers indicated that the Plaintiff would be arrested if she gave\nMichael Tricardo money for  bail and if they saw her in Court and\n-~  13\n\nif she went to visit Michael Tricardo.\na\n60.  The  Plaintiff  was  subjected  to  fal^fe  arrest,  false\nimprisonment, excessive and unnecessary seizure and an unjustified\nand an improper and unreasonable intrusive body serach. There was\nno probable cause for the stop, detention, seizure, imprisonment;\nand there was no other reasonable  suspicion  or basis for such.\nThere was absolutely no reasonable justification for the intrusive\nbody serach.\n61.  The actions and conduct of the law enforcement officers\nwere  taken  in the  course  of their  duties  and  functions  as  law\nenforcement  officers.  Although  illegal, unconstitutional,  and\nwrongful, the actions  and  conduct were taken  incidental  to the\notherwise lawful performance of their duties and functions.\n62.  The  actions  and  conduct  of  the  Officers  were  taken\n,—  pursuant  to and  implementation  of polices  and  practices  of  the\nmunicipal entity which policies and practices are grounded in the\nphilosophy  that  the  \"ends  justifies  the means\" and, therefore,\ncrossing the line is permissible  in order to obtain arrests and\nprosecutions of those whom law enforcement officers believe have\nengaged  in  otherwise  wrongful  conduct.  Fortunately,  the\nConstitution of the United States prohibits the \"ends justifies the\nmeans\"  approach  to  law  enforcement  which,  as  is  the  situation\nherein, caused the law enforcement officers to cross the line and\nengage in impermissible and unlawful conduct toward the Plaintiff\nin the context of the law enforcement agents' efforts to deal with\nthe  suspicions  that  they  possessed  with  respect  to  Michael\n14\n\nTricardo, there bring no existent reasonable suspicions regarding\ni\nG\nthe Plaintiff except and only for the fact that the Plaintiff was\nin the proximity of Michael Tricardo.\n63.  The Plaintiff  suffered  injuries and damages  including\nhumiliation,  anger,  mental  distress,  emotional  anguish,  and\npsychological trauma, the residual effects of which still continue.\n64.  The Plaintiff's  rights  under  the First,  Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendment to the United  States  Constitution and the\ncivil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, were violated.\nThe Plaintiff's right under the laws and Constitution of the State\nof New York were violated.\n65.  The  Plaintiff  was  otherwise  subjected  to  negligence\nactions on the part of the Defendants which negligence actions were\nn the proximate cause of the injuries and damages which she suffered.\n66.  The Plaintiff seeks yet to be calculated compensatory and\npunitive damages.\n67.  The Plaintiff has no other adequate remedy at law.\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n68.

STIPULATED FACTS\nThe  parties,  through  their  counsel,  stipulate  to  the\nfollowing:\n1.  The Plaintiff was arrested, subjected to a strip search,\nand detained on April 26, 2001 at approximately 6:00 P.M. on North\nBroadway in Tarrytown, New York.\n2.  Thomas McGurn is a Westchester County Department of Public\nSafety with approximately thirty  [30] years of police experience\nincluding seven [7] years of experience in narcotics.\n3.  Thomas McGurn was in charge of the April 26, 2001 field\noperation during which Nicole Sarnicola was arrested.\n4.  During the April 26, 2001 field operation, Westchester\nCounty Department of Public Safety Sergeant Thomas McGurn directed\nI  that the Plaintiff be arrested and subjected to a strip search.\nPursuant to McGurn's directive, Westchester County Department of\nPublic Safety Police Officers effected the arrest and strip search.\n5.  Westchester County Department of Public Safety Sergeant\nThomas  McGurn  was  responsible  for  authorizing  the  Plaintiff's\nrelease from her post arrest detention on April 26, 2001.\n6.  Without  the  Defendants  waiving  their  rights  to  offer\nadditional evidence as to what other information Sergeant McGurn\nknew  at  the  time  of  the  Plaintiff's  arrest  and  without  the\nPlaintiff waiving her right to contest whatever additional evidence\nis offered  by the Defendants  in this regard, the parties  agree\nthat,  at the time that Westchester  County  Department  of  Public\nn\n\nI\nII\nSafety  Sergeant  Thomas  McGurn  directed  that  the  Plaintiff  be  ijMl\n#\ni |  arrested, Defendant Thomas McGurn was aware: [a] that Gabriel Cruz-  , |\nH\n1\nKatz  was  an  individual  who  had  been  under  surveillance  by the\nWestchester  County  Police;  fb] that  Cruz-Katz  had  driven  his\nvehicle  into a parking  lot behind the CVS on South Broadway in\nTarrytown New York; fci that he was alone in his vehicle; [d] that\na  second  vehicle, in which  three  individuals  [a female and two\nmales] were situated, had been reported to be following the Cruz-\nKatz vehicle; fe] that the second vehicle parked in the CVS parking\nlot in Tarrytown proximate to the Cruz-Katz vehicle; [f ] that Cruz-\nKatz  exited  his  vehicle  and  the  three  individuals  exited  the\nvehicle in which they had been situated; fgl the individuals left\nthe lot at approximately the same time; [h] that within minutes\nafter leaving the lot, Cruz-Katz returned to the parking lot in a\n' I  vehicle  being  driven  by  undercover  Westchester  County  Police\nOfficer Christopher Kelly; [i] that Cruz-Katz immediately engaged\nin a drug transaction with undercover Westchester  County  Police\nOfficer Christopher Kelly by exchanging a large quantity of ecstacy\ntablets, then in the trunk of Cruz-Katz's vehicle and retrieved by\nhim from his trunk, for a significant sum of money provided to him\nby  undercover  Westchester  County  Police  Officer  Kelly  in\nundercover Westchester County Police Officer Kelly's vehicle; [i]\nthat Sergeant McGurn went up to the undercover Westchester County\nPolice Officer's vehicle where Cruz-Katz had just been taken from\nthe  vehicle  and  placed  under  arrest  by  Detective  George  Rowan\npursuant to a pre-ordained  signal  from undercover Officer Kelly\nO\n\nthat  the  transaction  had  taken  place;  fkl ,?that,  immediately\nD  %\n'• I  thereafter  and  after  providing  him  his  rights, Sergeant  McGurn\nasked  Cruz-Katz  if he wanted  to  cooperate;  f 1] ; that  Sergeant\nMcGurn  learned  from  Cruz-Katz,  who  indicated  that  he  would\nvoluntarily  cooperate, that Michael  Tricardo, one  of the  three\nindividuals in the other vehicle, had supplied him with the ecstacy\ntablets.\n7.  Sergeant Thomas McGurn directed Westchester County Police\nOfficer  Ana  Maria  Beckley  to  subject  the  Plaintiff  to  a  strip\nsearch  which  Officer  Beckley  conducted  after  reporting  to  the\nWestchester County Department of Public Safety facility.\n8.  Sergeant Thomas McGurn directed the strip search pursuant\nto  and  under  the  authority  of  the  policy  of  the  County  of\no\nWestchester encompassed in Westchester County Department of Public\n1  Safety General Order, Section 42.05, encaptioned Cavity Searches of\nPrisoners,  Issued  Date  01/01/92/Effective  Date  01/01/92  which\nSergeant McGurn believed allowed him to subject the Plaintiff to\nthe strip search.\n9.  Other than for what Sergeant McGurn knew at the time he\narrested the Plaintiff, he had no other information to believe that\nthe Plaintiff was concealing contraband and/or a weapon.\n10.  Sergeant  McGurn  directed  the  eventual  release  of  the\nPlaintiff.\n0\n\nIV.  PARTIES' CONTENTIONS  ,*\n1  A.  The Plaintiff's contentions.\nThe Plaintiff contends that, as a matter of law, there was no\nprobable cause to arrest her.  In substance the Plaintiff contends\nthat Defendant McGurn, who directed that the Plaintiff be arrested,\ndid not possess sufficient trustworthy, non ambiguous information\n[probable  cause]  to  believe  that  the  Plaintiff,  herself,  was\nspecifically  and  particularly  engaged  in  any  specific  criminal\nconduct.  The  Plaintiff  contends,  in  substance,  that,  while\nDefendant McGurn possessed sufficient trustworthy  information to\narrest both Michael Tricardo and Gabe Cruz-Katz at the time that\nthey were placed under arrest,  the Plaintiff was subjected to an\narrest by Sergeant McGurn simply because she was traveling  in a\n_-^  vehicle which contained Michael Tricardo and which was following\nthe vehicle of Gabe Cruz-Katz.  That is, the Plaintiff  contends\nthat \"vehicle and person proximity\" to Tricardo and Cruz-Katz and\n\"vehicle and person proximity\" alone were the basis for McGurn's\ndirective to arrest the Plaintiff  and that  she was arrested  so\nthat, along with Frank Rossi, another passenger  in her vehicle,\nshe/they could be brought to a police facility for interrogation in\norder to sort out what, if anything, she/they knew about the drug\ntransaction that had resulted in the probable cause based arrests\nof Tricardo and Cruz-Katz.  See: Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Consolidated\nStatement at Paragraph #'s  [la]-[54a].\nThe Plaintiff also contends that, as a matter of law, there\nwas no legitimate law enforcement justification to subject her to\nO\n\na strip search. She contends that, if there was^no probable cause\nto arrest her, then there was no justification to subject her to a\nstrip search.  Moreover, the Plaintiff contends that, even if there\nwas  probable  cause  for  her  arrest  [arguendo],  there  was  no\nindependent basis, beyond the probable cause [arguendo], to believe\nthat  she  was  secreting  contraband  or  weapons  to  justify  the\nintrusive search. She contends, in fact, that, by the absence of a\npre-strip  search  \"pat/frisk\"  search  and  by  the  admission  of\nSergeant  McGurn,  there was  an  absence  of  any  belief  that  she\npossessed contraband or a weapon and that she presented a security\nconcern.  See:  Plaintiff's  Consolidated  Rule  56.1  Statement  at\nParagraph #'s  [41a]-[42a] and  [lb]-[10b].\nThe Plaintiff contends, as well, that, to the extent that the\npolicy allowed the Plaintiff to be subjected to the strip search\n'  and propelled such to be undertaken pursuant to the direction of\nSergeant McGurn, the policy, on its face and/or as applied,  is\nunconstitutional.\nFinally, the Plaintiff contends that, whether or not there was\nprobable cause for her arrest and whether or not there was a lawful\nbasis to subject her to an intrusive body search  [strip search],\nthe  Plaintiff  was, as  a  matter  of  law,  unduly,  unnecessarily,\nunreasonably, and excessively and, therefore, unconstitutionally\ndetained once it was apparent or should have been apparent that she\nshould not be further detained and that she should be released.\nSee: Plaintiff's Consolidated Rule 56.1 Statement at Paragraph #'s\nn\n\nB.  The Defendants' Contentions  ,\nf\nThe Defendants contend:  fa\") that, as a matter of law and at\nthe  time  that  Sergeant  McGurn  directed  that  the  Plaintiff  be\narrested, he possessed sufficient trustworthy information to form\na probable cause basis to believe the Plaintiff had  engaged  in\nspecific  and  particular  criminal  conduct  to  justify  her  arrest\n[see:  testimonies  of  Detectives  Tkacz,  Rowan,  and  Kelly  and\nSergeant McGurn and Defendants' Exhibit #'s 1, 2, 3, 16, 17, 18,\n19, 20, and 21]; [b] that, as a matter of law, there was a lawful\nbasis to subject the Plaintiff  to a post arrest  intrusive body\nsearch  [strip  search] pursuant  to a  lawful  County  policy  [see:\ntestimony of Sergeant McGurn]; and  [c] that, as a matter of law,\nthe Plaintiff was otherwise released in a timely manner and fashion\nand that she was not unduly and unnecessarily and unreasonably and\n* I  excessively  and,  therefore,  unlawfully,  detained  once  it  was\napparent  or  it  should  have  been  apparent  that  she  should  be\nreleased [see: testimonies of Sergeant McGurn and Detective Pierro\nand Defendants' Exhibit #'s 6, 7, 8, and 9].\nThe Defendants contend,  moreover, that, even if there was no\nprobable cause for the Plaintiff's arrest and/or no basis for the\nstrip  search  and/or  no  basis  for  the  Plaintiff's  extended\ndetention, the Defendant Thomas McGurn is entitled, as a matter of\nlaw, to qualified immunity  [see: testimonies of Detectives Kelly,\nPierro, Rowan, and Tkacz and Sergeant Buonanno].\nn\n\nV.  ISSUES TO BE TRIED\ni\nIf  the  Defendant' Motion  For  Summary  Judgment  and/or  the\nPlaintiff's Cross Motion for Judgment are denied  in whole or in\npart, the factual issues to be tried are: fa] what information did\nSergeant  McGurn  possess  at  the  time  that  he  directed  the\nPlaintiff's arrest; and/or [b] what was the basis for the directive\nby Segregant McGurn to subject the Plaintiff to a strip search;\nand/or [c] when was the Plaintiff advised that she was free to go.\nApplying the jury's resolved factual disputes to the Court's\ninstructed law, the legal issues to be tried are: [a] whether there\nwas probable  cause  for the arrest of the Plaintiff; and/or  fb]\nwhether there was a legitimate law enforcement justification for\nthe intrusive strip search; and/or [c] whether the County policy,\npursuant  to  which  the  strip  search  was  conducted  was\nH I\n'  unconstitutional;  and/or  [d]  whether  the  Plaintiff  was  held\nunnecessarily  and  excessively  [unconstitutionally]  rather  than\nbeing permitted to leave in a prompt manner and fashion  [assuming\nthat there was probable cause for the arrest]; and/or fe] whether\nDefendant  McGurn  met  his  burden  with  respect  to  his  qualified\nimmunity defense on each of the Plaintiff's asserted claims.\nO\n\nn VI.

      "text": "229 F.Supp.2d 259 (2002)\nNicole SARNICOLA, Plaintiff,\nv.\nThe COUNTY OF WESTCHESTER, a Municipal Entity, Westchester County Police\nSergeant Thomas McGurn, individually and in his official capacity, Defendants.\nNo. 01 CIV. 6078(CM).\nUnited States District Court, S.D. New York.\nOctober 23, 2002.\n260 *260 Jane Hogan Felix, Office of Charlene M. Indelicato, Westchester County Attorney, White Plains, NY, for\nDefendants.\nJames I. Meyerson, New York, NY, for Plaintiff.\nMEMORANDUM AND DECISION GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART THE CROSS-MOTIONS FOR\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT\nMCMAHON, District Judge.\nPlaintiff, Nicole Sarnicola, brings this action alleging false arrest in violation of her rights as guaranteed under the\nFourth Amendment to the United States and the New York State Constitution. Plaintiff also alleges that she was\n261 subjected to an unlawful strip search in violation of her *261 Fourth Amendment rights and the New York\nConstitution, and that this unlawful strip search was pursuant to an unconstitutional policy of the defendant\nCounty of Westchester. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that, even assuming probable cause for her arrest, she was\nunnecessarily and excessively detained and held in police custody in violation of her rights under the Fourth\nAmendment. Defendant denies all of these allegations, and moves for summary judgment pursuant to\nFed.R.Civ.P. 56. Plaintiff cross-moves for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56.\nFACTS PERTINENT TO THE MOTION\nThe following facts are undisputed, unless otherwise noted.\nOn April 26, 2001, Plaintiff, Nicole Sarnicola, drove a silver Dodge Durango from Brooklyn, New York, to a\nparking lot in Tarrytown, New York. Plaintiff was accompanied by two other passengers, later identified as\nMichael Tricardo and Frank Rossi. Plaintiff was following a vehicle driven by Gabriel Cruz-Katz, an individual\nknown as a drug dealer by the Westchester County Police.\nSergeant Thomas McGurn is a Westchester County Department of Public Safety Officer with approximately 30\nyears of police experience, including seven years of experience in Narcotics. He was in charge of the Narcotics\nUnit on April 26, 2001. On that date, Sergeant McGurn was responsible for coordinating the efforts of numerous\npolice officers from the Westchester County Department of Public Safety and the Tarrytown Police Department in\nthe undercover field \"buy and bust\" operation involving Gabriel Cruz-Katz. The back-up officers were in\ncommunication with Sgt. McGurn and were also responsible for security and surveillance. The officers were\npositioned in various locations in the vicinity of the CVS parking lot in Tarrytown, New York and the surrounding\nstreets.\nThe Defendant County of Westchester (the \"County\") is a municipal entity existing under the laws of the\nConstitution of the State of New York.\nOn April 11, 2001, a controlled informant introduced an undercover police officer, Detective Christopher Kelly, to\nGabriel Cruz-Katz. The purpose of the introduction was to arrange for future ecstasy purchases.\n\nOn April 12, 2001, Detective Kelly met Cruz-Katz at a pre-arranged location in Tarrytown, New York and\npurchased one hundred ecstasy pills at a cost of one thousand dollars. Also present at the scene as back-up\nofficers, although unbeknownst to Cruz-Katz, was defendant Sgt. Thomas McGurn, Detective Rodriguez and\nDetective Weather. On April 13, 2001, Detective Kelly again met Cruz-Katz at a pre-arranged location in\nTarrytown, New York and purchased one hundred ecstacy pills at a cost of one thousand dollars. Sgt. McGurn,\nDetective Antonecchia, Detective Rodriguez and Detective Weather were also present, again unbeknownst to\nCruz-Katz.\nOn April 18, 2001, in anticipation of what was to be the third drug transaction between Detective Kelly and Cruz-\nKatz, Sgt. McGurn and Sgt. Buonanno of the Tarrytown Police Department, positioned themselves on Route 9 in\nthe Village of Irvington. The Sergeants observed Cruz-Katz driving the same vehicle that he had used on\nprevious occasions. They followed Cruz-Katz into the front parking lot of the Hilton Hotel, where he pulled behind\na Lincoln Sedan. A white male got out of the Lincoln and got into the passenger side of the Cruz-Katz vehicle.\n262 McGurn and Buonanno observed Cruz-Katz drive *262 to the front overhang of the hotel where the white male\nleaned over to Cruz-Katz and then exited the vehicle.\nCruz-Katz immediately proceeded to the pre-arranged location in Tarrytown where he met up with Detective Kelly\nand delivered one thousand ecstacy pills at a cost of eight thousand dollars. Cruz-Katz was observed leaving the\nlocation and proceeding directly back to the Hilton's parking lot, where he parked the vehicle and walked into\nhotel lobby. The white male from the Lincoln exited his car and followed Cruz-Katz into the lobby. Shortly\nafterward, both subjects left the hotel and returned to their respective vehicles. Lieutenant Emerson, Sgt.\nMcGurn, Sgt. Buonanno, and Detectives Martin, Rodriguez, Pierro and Tkacz were present in the area of the\ndrug transaction as back-up officers.\nThe fourth pre-arranged meeting between Detective Kelly and Cruz-Katz was scheduled for Tarrytown, New York\non April 26, 2001. The Westchester County Police intended to do a \"buy and bust\" of Cruz-Katz 00 that is, buy\n97\ndrugs and immediately arrest the seller. Sergeant McGurn was the coordinating officer for this operation.\nOn April 26, 2001, Detective Tkacz observed the Cruz-Katz vehicle exit Interstate Route 87 and travel north on\nBroadway in the village of Tarrytown. Detective Tkacz immediately observed that the Cruz-Katz's car was being\nfollowed by a Dodge Durango with three occupants. Detective Tkacz radioed this information to Sgt. McGurn.\nCaptain Annis, Detective Antonecchia, Detective Bravo, Detective Clarke, Detective Pierro, Detective Polant,\nDetective Rodriguez, Detective Rowan, Sergeant Buonanno, as well as other members of the Tarrytown Police\nDepartment, were all positioned in various locations around the CVS parking lot in Tarrytown for the buy and\nbust. Several of the officers were armed with shotguns and dispatched as security personnel. Their function was\nto watch the street for persons working with the drug supplier who might create a dangerous situation for the\npolice personnel and civilians in the area.\nSergeant McGurn believed, based on his experience, that the car following Cruz-Katz contained Cruz-Katz's drug\nsupplier. McGurn Deposition p. 21, lines 9-25, p. 22, lines 1-25, p. 23, lines 1-7. He further believed that such\nactivity so closely fit with his prior experiences in narcotics transactions that it was a \"textbook\" scenario. McGurn\nDeposition, p. 35, lines 17-25, p. 36, lines 1-6. His belief was further fueled by the fact that Cruz-Katz had met\nwith another individual (the white male in the Lincoln) both before and after the third buy went down.\nDetective Kelly observed the Cruz-Katz vehicle as it drove past his location while he was parked on Broadway in\nthe Village of Tarrytown at the pre-arranged time for their meeting. Kelly paged Cruz-Katz that he was on his way.\nCruz-Katz did not mention that he was driving with any other individuals.\nDetective Rowan observed the Cruz-Katz vehicle pull into the CVS parking lot, followed immediately by the\nDodge Durango, which was being driven by plaintiff. The two cars were parked next to each other. Cruz-Katz got\nout of his vehicle and stood at the rear of the car. Then the passengers of the Durango 00 plaintiff, Tricardo and\n97\nRossi 00 left their vehicle.\n97\nThere is some dispute as to the specific details, although not the general details, of what happened next.\nConsidering only the undisputed facts, and ignoring every disputed observation, Detective Rowan observed\n263 Cruz-Katz, Tricardo, Rossi and plaintiff standing together having a conversation. *263 He could not make out\n\nwhat was being said. After this, plaintiff and Rossi left the parking lot together, followed by Tricardo and Cruz-\n[1]\nKatz.  Rossi continued to observe them until he saw Tricardo and Cruz-Katz walk off to the left and the plaintiff\nand Rossi walk off to the right. Rowan then lost sight of all four. Rowan Deposition p. 26, lines 21-23, p. 27, lines\n9-12.\nAt about the same time, or shortly thereafter, Detective Kelly, looking through his passenger side mirror, observed\nCruz-Katz walking toward his (Kelly's) undercover vehicle through his passenger side mirror. Detective Kelly saw\nCruz-Katz walking with two persons he did not know; he thinks they were plaintiff and Rossi. Kelly testified that\nplaintiff and Rossi looked into his (Kelly's) car and continued walking while Cruz-Katz got in on the passenger\nside. Kelly Deposition, p. 17, line 25, p. 18, lines 1-9, p. 22, lines 7-25, p. 49, lines 18-25, page 50, lines 1-14.\nDetective Kelly did not write any of this down in his field report and Plaintiff and Rossi both deny doing any type\nof \"walk-by surveillance\" of any vehicle. For purposes of this motion I will ignore all references to this alleged\nactivity.\nDetective Kelly drove his vehicle to a side street, where his back-up team was positioned, to complete the\ntransaction. Cruz-Katz was supposed to provide Detective Kelly with 5000 ecstacy pills in exchange for thirty-two\nthousand five hundred dollars ($32,500). Cruz-Katz told Kelly that the drugs were in his car. They drove to the\nCVS parking lot, where Cruz-Katz's car and the Dodge Durango vehicle were parked. Cruz-Katz exited Detective\nKelly's vehicle, went to the trunk of his car and retrieved a package. Cruz-Katz reentered the undercover vehicle\nand turned the drugs over to Detective Kelly. Detective Kelly provided Cruz-Katz with twenty-thousand dollars in\ncash and told Cruz-Katz to count the money. Kelly then got out of the vehicle, claiming that the remainder of the\nmoney was in the trunk. When he opened the trunk (the signal to the back-up team that the buy had gone down),\nCruz-Katz was taken into custody.\nImmediately after Cruz-Katz was taken into custody, Sergeant McGurn questioned him about the identity of the\nthree individuals who accompanied him in the Dodge Durango. After waiving his Miranda Rights, Cruz-Katz\nstated that Michael Tricardo was his drug supplier and that Tricardo had followed him from Brooklyn so he could\ncollect his money on the spot. Defendants allege that Cruz-Katz also admitted that he and Tricardo held\nnumerous cell phone communications during the ride from Brooklyn, during which Tricardo told Cruz-Katz how\nthe drug deal should take place and instructed him to get it over quickly. Cruz-Katz also alleged that Tricardo\nrepeated these statements when the four individuals were conversing in the parking lot. McGurn Deposition p.\n28, lines 11-25, p. 29, lines 1-3, p. 31, lines 7-25, p. 35, lines 7-25, p. 36, lines 1-6. These comments about the\ncell phone calls and the content of the parking lot conversation are not documented in the field report and plaintiff\ncontends that Crux-Katz did not make these statements until after he was taken to Police Headquarters. For\n264 purposes of this motion, I accept *264 plaintiff's version and ignore the alleged comments.[2]\nBefore McGurn spoke with Cruz-Katz, he directed Detective Rowan to find the three individuals who had driven\nup in the Durango. All three were located in the vicinity, taken into custody and brought to the Westchester\nCounty Department of Public Safety Headquarters. None of them was questioned in the parking lot or in the\npolice cars. Plaintiff arrived in headquarters sometime between 6:30 and 7:00 P.M. While at the headquarters,\npursuant to the order of Sgt. McGurn, plaintiff was strip searched by Officer Ana Maria Beckley.\nOfficer Beckley was called from her post to report to headquarters to conduct a strip search of the plaintiff at\napproximately 7:00 P.M. Officer Beckley vouchered the plaintiff's jewelry and personal items and then took her to\na secluded area in the headquarters to conduct a strip search. Officer Beckley asked plaintiff to take off each item\nof clothing and to hand it to her. The plaintiff complied with the officer's requests. When the plaintiff had removed\nall of her clothes, the officer asked her to turn around and bend over. After inspecting her anal area, Officer\nBeckley allowed plaintiff to re-dress. Officer Beckley made no physical contact with the plaintiff.\nFollowing the strip search, Detective Pierro questioned the plaintiff from approximately 8:20 P.M. until 8:45 P.M.,\nat which time Sarnicola completed a brief written statement. She remained in a room with another officer for\nseveral hours, while officers were questioning the three men. Plaintiff was eventually released to the lobby of the\nheadquarters after the completion of the interviews with the three other subjects and after consultation with the\nDistrict Attorney's Office. Defendants contend that plaintiff was brought to the lobby at approximately 10:40 P.M.,\nand that at approximately 10:45 P.M., she was told that she could leave. McGurn Deposition, p. 69-71, Sarnicola\n\nDeposition p. 49, lines 20-24, p. 50, lines 1-10, p. 50, lines 22-24, p. 51, lines 1-4. Plaintiff believes that it was\ncloser to 11:30 P.M. when she was brought downstairs to the front desk and lobby and released. Plaintiff's\nResponse to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement, ¶ 17. Regardless, it is undisputed that plaintiff, along with Rossi,\nremained at headquarters until approximately midnight, so they could ride back to Brooklyn with two detectives 00\n97\nDetectives Pierro and Antonecchia 00 who were members of a team of officers going to conduct a search of\n97\nTricardo's apartment.\nNo charges were ever filed against Sarnicola.\nOn July 5, 2001, plaintiff commenced this action, alleging false arrest, excessive seizure and unlawful strip\nsearch in violation of her Fourth Amendment rights and her rights under the New York State Constitution and the\nlaws of New York. Plaintiff also alleged a Monell claim against the County of Westchester, claiming that the\n265 unlawful strip search was pursuant to an unconstitutional operative policy of the *265 County encompassed\nwithin certain interrelated Westchester County Department of Public Safety General Orders. Additionally, plaintiff\nalleged a respondeat superior claim against the County of Westchester, and negligence claims against both\ndefendants.\nOn February 7, 2002, defendants filed for summary judgment, and on February 22, 2002, plaintiff cross-moved\nfor summary judgment, both pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 56.\nFor the reasons stated below, I grant summary judgment to the defendants on the false arrest claims and\nexcessive confinement claims under both federal and state law. (First and Second Cause of Action; Fifth Cause\nof Action, in part). I also grant defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing Sarnicola's state law claim of\nnegligence (Seventh Cause of Action).\nI grant summary judgment to the plaintiff on her unlawful strip search claim against Sgt. McGurn, finding a clear\nviolation of her Fourth Amendment rights and her parallel State Constitutional rights and finding no basis for\nimputing qualified immunity to Sgt. McGurn. (Third Cause of Action; Fifth Cause of Action, in part).\nUnfortunately, while the strip search violated the written policy of Westchester County, there is a disputed issue of\nmaterial fact concerning whether that policy was routinely ignored. If so, then routine strip searches of all felony\nnarcotics arrestees, without probable cause to believe they are secreting contraband, would qualify as a\n\"practice\" of the County. In addition, the parties have not sufficiently developed the record on the issues relating\nto County liability for the strip search under state law. Thus, I deny both parties' motions for summary judgment\nagainst the County on the strip search claim. (Fourth and Sixth Cause of Action).\nDISCUSSION\nI. Summary Judgment Standard\nOn a motion for summary judgment, the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law if there are no genuine\nissues of material fact. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505,\n91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). If a genuine issue for trial exists such that a reasonable jury could find in favor of the non-\nmovant, then summary judgment must be denied. See Id. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. The court must view the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nnon-movant. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142, (1970); In re\nChateaugay Corp., 10 F.3d 944, 957 (2d Cir.1993).\nII. There Was Probable Cause to Arrest Nicole Sarnicola\n\"Probable cause to arrest a person exists if the law enforcement official, on the basis of the totality of the\ncircumstances, has sufficient knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information to justify a person of reasonable\ncaution in believing that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.\" United States\nv. Patrick, 899 F.2d 169, 171 (2d Cir.1990). The defendant bears the burden of establishing that his actions were\n\njustified based on probable cause. Raysor v. Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, 768 F.2d 34 (2d Cir.1985),\ncert. denied,475 U.S. 1027, 106 S.Ct. 1227, 89 L.Ed.2d 337. To meet that burden the defendant must show that\nhe had a quantum of evidence which amounted to \"more than a rumor, suspicion, or even a strong reason to\n266 suspect.\" United States v. Fisher,*266 702 F.2d 372, 375 (2d Cir.1983) (citations omitted).\nProbable cause does not require a prima facie showing of criminal activity or a showing that evidence of a crime\nwill, more likely than not, be found. United States v. Cruz, 834 F.2d 47 (2d Cir.1987). Probable cause requires\nthat the possibility of criminal activity or the possibility of evidence of a crime will be found. Texas v. Brown, 460\nU.S. 730, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983). Moreover, in determining whether probable cause exists, the\nexperience and expertise of the law enforcement agents should be taken into consideration. United States v.\nZabala, 52 F.Supp.2d 377, 382 (S.D.N.Y.1999); United States v. Perea, 848 F.Supp. 1101, 1104 (E.D.N.Y.1994).\nEvidence \"must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those\nversed in the field of law enforcement.\" United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d\n621 (1981).\nNo reasonable juror could conclude that Sergeant McGurn lacked probable cause to arrest plaintiff Nicole\nSarnicola on the evening of April 26, 2001 and to detain her pending investigation. While the details are as to\nwhat happened in the parking lot are contested, the undisputed facts, and the circumstances surrounding them,\ngive rise to probable cause: Sarnicola drove an SUV following Cruz-Katz, a known drug dealer who had\npreviously sold large amounts of narcotics to an undercover agent; she parked next to him and got out of the\nSUV with two men (one of whom was later determined to be Cruz-Katz's supplier); she participated in a\ndiscussion with the men; she left the parking lot at approximately the same time that Cruz-Katz left with the\nsupplier, and shortly thereafter the pre-arranged \"buy and bust\" was completed. Sgt. McGurn's belief that the\noccupants of the SUV were drug suppliers was based not only on these observations, but also on his experience\nin narcotics enforcement, and his observations of a deal Cruz-Katz had conducted earlier that month.\nDefendant's 56.1 Statement ¶ 7, 8 (numerous citations to record omitted). These facts and circumstances give\nrise to probable cause that Sarnicola was a participant in drug activity. That this suspicion later turned out to be\n[3]\nunfounded is irrelevant.\nPlaintiff argues that her mere \"proximity 00 even with a verbal exchange, without something more affirmative\n97\nconduct [sic] specifically linking the Plaintiff to a participation in the drug dealing enterprise, is not sufficient to\nform a probable cause justification for the full custodial arrest.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law at 14. As this court\nsaid several years ago, in Flores v. City of Mount Vernon, 41 F.Supp.2d 439 (S.D.N.Y.1999), \".....the mere fact\nthat a person is physically proximate to others who are suspected of criminal narcotics activity does not give rise\nto probable cause; there must be something more in order for an arrest to be lawful.\" Id. at 443. But Sarnicola\nwas not just \"physically proximate\" to the real criminals, Cruz-Katz and Tricardo. She did in fact engage in\naffirmative conduct that was closely connected with the crime. She drove Tricardo, the suspected supplier of the\ndrugs, to Tarrytown; she got out of the car with him; and she engaged in conversation with Tricardo and Cruz-\n267 Katz, albeit briefly. That is more than physical proximity 00 it is *267 the \"something more\" required to give rise to\n97\nprobable cause. United States v. Patrick, 899 F.2d 169 (2d Cir.1990).\nIn Patrick, Christopher Patrick and his co-defendant, Linda Taylor, entered the U.S. Immigration Office at Niagara\nFalls, New York after crossing the international border on foot from Canada. Taylor entered first carrying a\nknapsack, followed by Patrick who was also carrying a knapsack. They were the only two civilian pedestrians in\nthe office at the time. Patrick, 899 F.2d at 170.\nBoth were questioned by a U.S. Customs inspector about their citizenship and length of stay in Canada. Both told\nthe inspector that they had accidentally crossed the Canadian border on a bus, and after realizing their mistake\nhad walked back to the United States. Id. The inspector found their answers to be suspicious, and directed them\nto another inspection point, where their belongings were searched. Cocaine was found in the lining of Taylor's\npurse. Over the next few hours, both Taylor and Patrick were interrogated, and eventually Patrick made an oral\nand written statement that a person named \"Gino\" had asked him to accompany Taylor to make sure that the\npackages were delivered to Niagara Falls. Id.\n\nTaylor and Patrick were indicted on one count of unlawful importation of a controlled substance and one count of\nunlawful possession of a controlled substance. At trial, both defendants made motions to suppress any\ninculpatory statements made after they were detained. The district court denied Taylor's motion, but granted\nPatrick's motion to suppress those statements, finding that the Customs inspector lacked probable cause to\narrest Patrick. Id. at 17000171. The government appealed the suppression order. Id. at 170.\n97\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, finding that there was probable cause for Patrick's arrest. The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that the following factors added up to probable cause: Patrick and Taylor had entered the office\ntogether, waited in line next to each other, and told the inspector the same suspicious story of how they\nhappened to walk from Canada to the United States. Id. Those facts indicated that Taylor and Patrick were\ntraveling together. Once drugs were found in Taylor's bag, there was enough evidence to indicate that the two\nwere traveling and acting together, which provided probable cause for Patrick's arrest. Id. at 171-172.\nThe Second Circuit distinguished Patrick's situation from the one in Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 91-93, 100\nS.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979). There, police who had a warrant to search a bartender and the premises in\nwhich he worked frisked every patron who happened to be in the bar at the time they arrived to execute the\nwarrant. The Supreme Court concluded that there was no probable cause to search the plaintiff, because all the\npolice knew about him was that he was a patron in the bar 00 he himself had done nothing that might give rise to\n97\nprobable cause. In contrast, Sarnicola was not in the Tarrytown parking lot by happenstance. Police had\nobserved her driving two men to the location while following the car of a known drug dealer and then conversing\nwith all three men. Her actions, not her mere presence, aroused suspicion.\nIn addition to Ybarra, plaintiff cites Flores v. City of Mount Vernon in support of her proposition. But the egregious\nfacts of Flores are even less helpful to her.\nIn Flores, a confidential informant told the Mount Vernon police that the owner of a local pub was selling cocaine.\nA police investigator swore out a warrant based on the informant's report. The warrant authorized the Mount\n268 Vernon Police Department *268 to search the pub for evidence of narcotics and to look for a male named Shawn.\nA detective with the Mount Vernon Police Department executed the warrant on March 20, 1997. On that evening,\nFlores was working at the pub as a bartender/waitress. The police entered the pub, and spent about an hour and\na half searching. Ms. Flores, the only employee behind the bar when the police entered, was ordered to sit on a\nstool with her hands on her lap. No narcotics were found on or behind the bar where Ms. Flores had been\nworking. Ms. Flores was not frisked while at the pub, but her pocketbook was searched, and no drugs were\nfound. Shawn, the owner of the pub, and three other patrons were arrested for possession of cocaine. However,\nthe police arrested Ms. Flores and took her to Mount Vernon Police Headquarters, where she was strip searched\nby a female officer. She was not charged and was allowed to leave. Flores, 41 F.Supp.2d at 441-442. Nothing in\nthe facts known to the police gave rise to probable cause that Karen Flores had committed a crime or had drugs\non her person. Ms. Flores was arrested simply and solely because she had a job at the bar. That is a far cry from\nfollowing a drug dealer to the scene of a planned buy, under circumstances that lead police to believe that the\noccupants of the vehicle are involved in a felony drug deal.\nThus, Sergeant McGurn had ample probable cause to order plaintiff arrested and detained pending further\ninvestigation. Defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's second cause of action, alleging false\narrest in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is granted. Their motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's fifth\ncause of action, insofar as it alleges the non-constitutional torts of false arrest and false imprisonment, is also\ngranted, since the existence of probable cause negates any such claim as a matter of state law. Bernard v.\nUnited States, 25 F.3d 98, 102 (2d Cir.1994); Weyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, 852 (2d Cir.1996); Posr v. Doherty,\n944 F.2d 91, 96 (2d Cir.1991). Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment addressed to these claims is\ndenied.\nIII. Plaintiff was Subjected to an Unlawful Strip Search\nBy far the most interesting 00 and complicated 00 question raised by this case is whether it was constitutionally\n97 97\npermissible for Sgt. McGurn to order that Sarnicola be strip searched. It is also the issue least adequately briefed\n\nby the parties, who are, for the most part, content to rest on their analysis of whether there was or was not\nprobable cause to arrest plaintiff. Unfortunately, that issue is far from dispositive.\nThe facts relevant to the search are undisputed. I conclude that McGurn's search violated Sarnicola's Fourth\nAmendment rights, because McGurn had no individualized reasonable suspicion to believe that plaintiff was\nconcealing weapons or contraband on her person. Moreover, McGurn is not entitled to qualified immunity; his\nstrip search order violated not only settled constitutional law but Westchester County's official policy concerning\nstrip searches. Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against McGurn on this claim.\nA. The strip search violated Sarnicola's Fourth Amendment rights\nbecause McGurn did not have a particularized reasonable belief that\nshe was secreting contraband.\n1. Legal Standard.\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits \"unreasonable\" searches and seizures. For more than two decades, courts\n269 have specifically and repeatedly recognized the importance *269 of guarding against unreasonable strip\nsearches, in view of the degrading nature of this particular invasion of privacy. In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99\nS.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the United States Supreme Court ruled that Fourth Amendment\nreasonableness analysis had to balance the need for a particular search against the invasion of personal rights\nimplicated. Stating that the \"test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise\ndefinition or mechanical application,\" Chief Justice Rehnquist held that the reasonableness of a strip search\nturned on (1) the scope of the intrusion, (2) the manner in which the search is conducted, (3) the justification for\ninitiating the search, and (4) the place in which the search in conducted. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861\n(citations omitted). And while the Supreme Court stated in 1973 that \"full body searches\" incident to a lawful\narrest were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38\nL.Ed.2d 427 (1973), numerous post-Bell courts have held that strip searches are not automatically justified by a\nlawful arrest. See Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1446 (9th Cir.1991)(holding that a search incident to\narrest under Robinson did not extend to a strip search or bodily intrusion) (citation omitted), Mary Beth G. v. City\nof Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983)(\"[the Robinson court] simply did not contemplate the significantly\ngreater intrusions\" of a strip or body cavity search). In addition, the Supreme Court has implicitly recognized that\nthey have not considered the circumstances under which a strip search is justified incident to arrest. See Illinois\nv. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 644-646, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983)(discussing the permissible scope of\nsearches incident to arrest, and their holdings in Robinson and United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 94 S.Ct.\n1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974), and stating: \"we were not addressing in Edwards, and do not discuss here, the\ncircumstances in which a strip search of an arrestee may or may not be appropriate\").\nA particularized reasonableness analysis under Bell v. Wolfish is required to establish the lawfulness of any\nwarrantless strip search, even one conducted incident to a lawful arrest. Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\nCir.1997) A determination of reasonableness must be based on \"all of the circumstances surrounding the search\nor seizure and the nature of the search or seizure itself.\" United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531,\n537, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985) (citation omitted). The reasonable suspicion test is objective, not\nsubjective 00 that is, the test is whether a reasonable officer could have particularized suspicion considering the\n97\ntotality of the circumstances. Cartier v. Lussier, 955 F.2d 841, 843 (2d Cir.1992).\nThe Second Circuit, applying Bell v. Wolfish, has held that a strip search of a misdemeanor arrestee is unlawful\nunless there is \"reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the\ncrime charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\" Weber v.\nDell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986)cert denied sub no. County of Monroe v. Weber, 483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct.\n3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762. In the sixteen years following Weber, the Second Circuit has firmly held that strip searches\nof persons lawfully arrested for minor infractions (misdemeanors and violations) must be justified by an\nindividualized reasonable suspicion of concealed weapons or contraband. See e.g. Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56\n270 (2d Cir.2001); Kaufman v. Rivera, 1999 WL 197199, 1999 U.S.App. LEXIS 6259 *270 (2d Cir.1999); Elk v.\n\nTownson, et al., 839 F.Supp. 1047 (2d Cir.1993). The Second Circuit also requires reasonable suspicion based\non individual circumstances to justify strip searches in other contexts. See e.g., Varrone v. Bilotti, 123 F.3d 75 (2d\nCir.1997)(reasonable suspicion clearly required for strip search of prison visitors); Security and Law Enforcement\nEmployees v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187 (2d Cir.1984)(reasonable suspicion standard required for strip search of prison\nguards). While the Second Circuit has not spoken directly to the appropriate test for the validity of a strip search\nincident to a felony arrest, this Court recently opined that the Court of Appeals would apply the particularized\nreasonable suspicion test to searches of felony arrestees as well, rather than permitting strip searches of all\nfelony arrestees solely because they had been arrested for a felony. Murcia v. County of Orange, 226 F.Supp.2d\n[4]\n489 (S.D.N.Y. 2002); Dodge v. County of Orange, 209 F.R.D. 65 (S.D.N.Y.2002).  There would seem to be no\nconstitutional prerogative to strip search individuals in the absence of particularized reasonable suspicion that\nthey are carrying drugs or contraband.\nOfficial policy statements in the record demonstrate that, at least on paper, Westchester County understands the\nlegal restrictions on strip searches incident to lawful arrests. The County's policy tracks the language of the\ncontrolling cases: strip searches are permitted only in cases in which the searching officer had reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee was carrying contraband based on the nature of the crime committed, the\nparticular characteristics of the arrestee, or the circumstances of the arrest. An officer who wishes to conduct a\nstrip search must obtain permission from a supervisor, and must conduct the search in accordance with rules\ndesigned to protect the privacy of the person searched. General Order No. 42.05 (Exhibit 9 in support of Plaintiff's\nCross Motion for Summary Judgment). The policy does not distinguish between persons arrested for felonies and\nmisdemeanors. On its face, such a policy is constitutional.\nMs. Sarnicola was arrested at the scene of a crime because the police had probable cause to believe that she\nwas involved in a felony. She was brought to the jail and strip searched upon arrival, before any further\ndetermination was made about her involvement in the crime. She was not mixed in with the general population of\na correctional facility. The validity of Ms. Sarnicola's strip search must be justified by individualized reasonable\nsuspicion that Ms. Sarnicola was concealing weapons or contraband, based on her particular circumstances.\n2. McGurn did not have particularized reasonable suspicion to order\nthat Sarnicola be strip searched.\nWhile the Westchester County policy does not define \"reasonable suspicion,\" the Second Circuit provided\nguidance in Varrone v. Bilotti, 123 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir. 1997):\n\"A `reasonable suspicion' of wrongdoing is something stronger than a mere `hunch,' but\nsomething weaker than probable cause.\" To establish reasonable suspicion, \"prison officials must\n271 point to specific objective facts and rational *271 inferences that they are entitled to draw from\nthose facts in light of their experience.\" The standard requires \"individualized suspicion,\nspecifically directed to the person who is targeted for the strip search...\" (citations omitted)\nThe Supreme Court has also recently discussed the concept of reasonable suspicion (in the context of an\ninvestigatory stop, rather than a strip search) in U.S. v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d\n740 (2002):\nWhen discussing how reviewing courts should make reasonable-suspicion determinations, we\nhave said repeatedly that they must look at the \"totality of the circumstances\" of each case to see\nwhether the detaining officer has a \"particularized and objective basis\" for suspecting legal\nwrongdoing. (citation omitted)\nAs long ago as 1978, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reviewed factors to be considered\nin determining the reasonableness of a strip search. United States v. Asbury, 586 F.2d 973, 976-977 (2d Cir.1978)\n. These include:\n1. Excessive nervousness\n\n2. Unusual conduct\n3. An informant's tip\n4. Information showing pertinent criminal propensities\n5. Loose-fitting or bulky clothing\n6. An itinerary suggestive of wrongdoing\n7. Discovery of incriminating matter during less intrusive searches\n8. Lack of employment or a claim of self-employment\n9. Needle marks or other indications of drug addiction\n10. Information derived from searches of others arrested contemporaneously\n11. Inadequate luggage (particular to border searches)\n12. Evasive or contradictory answers to questions (citations omitted)\nThe Asbury court, citing United States v. Diaz, 503 F.2d at 1025, 1026 n. 1 (3d Cir.1974), noted that courts rely\nupon a combination of factors to determine reasonableness, rather than any single factor standing alone. See\nalso, Johnson v. Harron, 1995 WL 319943 (N.D.N.Y. May 23, 1995) (citing the Asbury factors and considering\nseveral in determining reasonableness of a strip search at the border). While Asbury dealt with a Customs border\nsearch rather than a custodial search, it relied on custodial search cases in compiling its list of relevant factors,\nand there is no reason to believe that the Court of Appeals would not find the Asbury factors relevant to a\ndetermination of the reasonableness of a strip search incident to a lawful arrest.\nThe record reveals that McGurn knew no more about Sarnicola when he directed that she be strip searched than\nhe knew when he ordered her arrest. He knew that she drove the alleged supplier to the scene of the buy, got out\nof her car and engaged in conversation with the alleged supplier and the seller. In other words, he knew enough\nto have her arrested for her suspected involvement in a drug deal. From his deposition testimony, it seems that\nhe believed a strip search was justified simply and solely because Plaintiff had been taken into custody in\nconnection with a drug deal:\nQ: What is the reason that you wanted her subjected to a strip search?\nA: The reason she was taken into custody, and as per our GO, that she be searched for weapons\nor contraband, and in cases dealing with narcotics, experience tells us all prisoners in dealing with\n272 specifically large scales of narcotics they will be *272 searched. (McGurn Deposition, p. 57, lines\n1-11)\nQ: Other than your general experience, did you have, in this particular matter, a specific belief, in\nthe specific context of this matter, that she was secreting drugs independent of the fact that you\nwere authorizing an arrest in a felony drug matter?\nA: Well, it's a felony drug matter and it deals with contraband and weapons, so there is also a\nsecurity issue here too, so we searched for both...I'm trying to explain that it's a procedure. Am I\ngoing to guess whether she has anything on her or not? No, I couldn't do that. (emphasis added)\n(McGurn Deposition, p. 59, lines 2-17)\nQ: Independent of the fact that this was an alleged felony transaction, did you have any particular\nbelief that particular day that she was particularly and specifically secreting drugs?\nA: No more than any other subject I would have arrested... (emphasis added)(McGurn Deposition,\np. 60, lines 6-11)\n\nBecause he did not harbor any particular belief that Sarnicola was secreting drugs, McGurn did not believe that\n[5]\nhe had any reason to order what he referred to as a \"cavity search\" on Sarnicola.\nA: I didn't deem [a cavity search] necessary.\nQ: Why not?\nA: Because we were dealing with a large amount of narcotics. I was looking for secreted narcotics.\nWhen other parties are included they usually have only a little on them, and usually a cavity\nsearch is done either in prison when prisoners are transporting a small amount of drugs. I didn't\nthink that applied here. (McGurn Deposition, p. 58, lines 5-16)\nHowever, Sgt. McGurn believed that County Police regulations authorized him to have Sarnicola strip and bend\nover, based solely on the fact that she had been arrested on a felony drug charge:\nQ: So pursuant to the regulations, this offense of a drug transaction, felony in nature, authorized\nyou to subject her to a strip search, correct?\nA: Oh, yes.\nQ: Other than the rules and regulations which authorized you to subject her to a strip search to\n273 determine *273 whether or not she was secreting drugs, and other than the fact that there was this\nfelony, alleged felony transaction, drug transaction, was there anything else that caused you to\nhave her strip searched?\nA: I think that is enough.\nA diligent search of the record fails to turn up evidence of any other objective fact that might have justified the\nsearch. There is no evidence that Sarnicola refused to identify herself or behaved suspiciously; no evidence that\nshe was dressed in a way that would have allowed her to secret contraband on her person; no evidence that she\nwalked or stood in a way that suggested she was secreting contraband; no evidence that she was a drug user;\nand no evidence that anyone else advised the police that she might be carrying drugs or weapons. Furthermore,\nno one has testified that the circumstances of this particular drug buy suggested that Sarnicola was carrying\ncontraband on her person. One could easily argue that the circumstances suggest precisely the opposite. She\nwas accused of participating in a pre-arranged buy of a large quantity of drugs, not in a street sale from a private\nstash. She was not the seller. The 500 ecstacy tablets that the County Police had arranged to purchase had\nalready been delivered to the undercover agent, in a wrapped package. She was apprehended, without warning,\nat the scene of the crime, and had no opportunity to hide anything. Finally, no pat-down or a less intrusive search\nof her belongings incident to her lawful arrest turned up any drugs or other contraband, which might have alerted\nauthorities to the possibility that more was being carried elsewhere on her person. Indeed, it appears that the\nstrip search, including the visual inspection of her buttocks in a bent-over position, was the first and only search\nof plaintiff.\nSo a reasonable trier of fact must take Sgt. McGurn at his word. He ordered Sarnicola strip searched because\nshe had been lawfully arrested for a felony involving narcotics. The question is whether that is enough to justify a\nstrip search. The answer, I conclude, is no.\nIn the past, courts (including this one) have stated in passing that being arrested for a narcotics offense could\ngive rise to an inference that the arrestee was secreting drugs on her person. See, e.g., Campbell v. Fernandez,\n[6]\n54 F.Supp.2d 195 (S.D.N.Y. 1999),Elk v. Townson, 839 F.Supp. 1047, 1052 (S.D.N.Y.1993).  However, to the\nbest of my knowledge, no court has ever held that being arrested for a narcotics-related crime automatically gives\nrise to reasonable suspicion that drugs are being carried in an arrestee's body cavities, so as to justify a strip\nsearch or visual body cavity inspection like the one performed on Sarnicola. An automatic justification for strip\n274 searches based on an arrest for a *274 drug-related crime would be inconsistent with the legal concept of\nreasonable suspicion based on the totality of the circumstances, as discussed above. See generally, United\nStates v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 266, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002)(holding that the lower court's\n\n\"evaluation and rejection of certain factors in isolation from each other [in evaluating reasonable suspicion] [did]\nnot take into account the `totality of the circumstances'\") New York State courts have found that factors other than\nbeing picked up in a drug operation are required to establish particularized reasonable suspicion that an arrestee\nis secreting contraband on his person. See People v. Jennings, 747 N.Y.S.2d 235 (2d Dept.2002) (evidence\nseized in strip search suppressed where record demonstrated that officers strip searched all occupants of\nautomobile where drugs had been found without particularized suspicion that this defendant was carrying drugs\nand despite fact that less intrusive pat down revealed no contraband); People v. Taylor, 294 A.D.2d 825, 741\nN.Y.S.2d 822 (4th Dept.2002) (defendant lawfully strip searched at station after officer discovered crack pipe in\nhis pocket and observed him moving legs and torso in a suspicious way). Other federal Circuits have also held\nthat a drug arrest does not automatically supply reasonable suspicion for a strip search. Foote v. Spiegel, 118\nF.3d 1416, 1425 (10th Cir. 1997)(\"the mere fact that [Plaintiff] was arrested for driving while under the influence of\ndrugs does not justify the strip search...even if there was probable cause to believe Foote was under the\ninfluence of marijuana, there was no particularized reason to believe she was hiding marijuana on her person)\"; \nSwain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997)(the fact that the plaintiff dropped a baggie of marijuana at the scene\nof the crime did not justify a strip search); see generally Kelly v. Foti, 77 F.3d 819, 822 (5th Cir.1996)(holding that\na strip search was not objectively reasonable because there was no \"individualized suspicion,\" and stating that\n\"pure speculation does not create a reasonable suspicion; nor does a generalized fear of a category of\narrestees\")(emphasis in original).\nHere, Sgt. McGurn had no particularized reason to suspect that Sarnicola was secreting drugs on her person. He\nordered a strip search simply and solely because Sarnicola was arrested for suspected involvement in a drug-\n[7]\nrelated felony. That does not even comport with County Police policy, let alone pass constitutional muster.\nAs was true of her false arrest/imprisonment claim, plaintiff asserts a parallel state law claim for unconstitutional\nsearch. As is true of the false arrest claim, the parties fail to brief the state law issues raised by the claim.\n(Plaintiff's Fifth Cause of Action) Neither party has discussed the state law claims in their briefs. Plaintiff does not\n275 ever specify what laws or provisions of the Constitution she believes *275 were violated, although in this case it is\npresumably Article I, Section 12 of the New York State Constitution, which parallels the Fourth Amendment. As\nthis court recently discussed in Murcia v. County of Orange, 226 F.Supp.2d 489 (S.D.N.Y.2002) there is no\nindication that the New York State Constitution affords any greater protection for strip searches than the Fourth\nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution. Murcia, 2002 WL 31245264, at *10. By the same token, it affords no less.\nThus, a search that violates the Federal Constitution necessarily violates the State Constitution. Plaintiff is\nentitled to summary judgment on her unconstitutional search claim under New York law.\nB. Sgt. McGurn is not entitled to qualified immunity.\nAs to the federal unreasonable search claim, Sgt. McGurn contends that he is entitled to summary judgment on\n[8]\nthe ground of qualified immunity.  Government officials performing discretionary functions are entitled to\nqualified immunity from federal constitutional claims of false arrest and false imprisonment \"as long as their\nactions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.\" \nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)(emphasis added). Or, put\notherwise, a police officer is immune from Federal constitutional claims when he performs a discretionary act\nbased on a mistaken but objectively reasonable belief that his conduct is constitutional. Finding reasonable\nsuspicion to conduct a strip search, like finding probable cause to arrest, is a discretionary act within a police\nofficer's official capacity. Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991). Therefore, an\nofficer who conducts a strip search is entitled to qualified immunity if officers of reasonable competence in the\nsame circumstances and with the same knowledge could disagree whether a strip search was constitutionally\njustified. See Lee v. Sandberg, 136 F.3d 94, 102 (2d Cir.1997); Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct.\n3034. In the probable cause context, this mistaken but objectively reasonable belief has recently been referred to\nas arguable probable cause. See, e.g., Coons v. Casabella, 284 F.3d 437, 441 (2d Cir.2002); Cerrone v. Brown,\n246 F.3d 194, 202 (2d Cir.2001); 1A Martin A. Schwartz & John E. Kirklin, Section 1983 Litigation Claims and\nDefenses § 3.21 (3d ed.1997).\n\nHere, Sgt. McGurn, by his own admission, ordered a strip search without having the slightest reason to suspect\nthat Sarnicola was secreting drugs on her person. No officer of reasonable competence could have thought that\nordering a strip search without individualized reasonable suspicion was justified. Any rational jury would find that\nMcGurn's order, which overtly violated written County policy, was \"so flawed that no reasonable officer would\nhave made a similar choice.\" Lennon v. Miller, 66 F.3d, 416, 425 (2d Cir.1995)(finding qualified immunity because\na rational jury could not find that officers judgement was thus flawed). Sgt. McGurn is not entitled to qualified\nimmunity for authorizing the strip search of Nicole Sarnicola.\nIV. No Reasonable Trier of Fact Could Find that Plaintiff's Confinement\nwas Excessive\nThere is no significant difference of opinion between plaintiff and defendants concerning her detention. She was\nat County Police Headquarters for at most five hours. During that time, she was interviewed and the three men\n276 arrested *276 with her were interviewed. When all the interviews had been conducted, plaintiff was free to go.\nShe lost an evening out of her life. No reasonable juror could conclude that she was detained for an\nunreasonable period of time. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claims of\n[9]\nexcessive detention, whether asserted under federal or state law.\nV. Plaintiff's Claim Against Westchester County Cannot Be Dismissed\non Summary Judgment.\nPlaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action alleges that Westchester County is liable to plaintiff because her arrest,\nexcessive detention and strip search were undertaken pursuant to policies and practices of Westchester County. \nMonell v. Dept. of Social Serv. of the City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). As I\nhave found no wrongful arrest and no excessive detention, the claims against Westchester County on these\ngrounds necessarily fail. The same is not true of the strip search claim, as to which plaintiff has been granted\nsummary judgment against McGurn.\nAs discussed above, Sgt. McGurn's actions did not accord with the written strip search/body cavity search policy\nof Westchester County, which requires reasonable suspicion based on the circumstances of the case. See\nGeneral Order Number 42.05, Exhibit 9 in Plaintiff's Cross Motion for Summary Judgement. However, while the\nsearch was a violation of the written policy of Westchester County, it may have been undertaken pursuant to the\nactual practices and usual customs of the Westchester County police. The deposition testimony of both Sgt.\nMcGurn and Officer Beckley suggest that strip searching all felony narcotics arrestees (possibly including a visual\nbody cavity search) was a routine practice of the County Police. McGurn Deposition, p. 57, lines 3-8, p. 59, lines\n8-11; Beckley Deposition, p. 23, lines 17-25, p. 24, lines 1-22. The potential contradiction between the policy and\nthe practices of the Westchester County Police preclude summary judgement.\nWhile there is no Federal respondeat superior liability for the actions of a municipal defendant, New York State\nlaw permits the imposition of derivative liability on a municipal employer. Plaintiff seeks to impose such liability on\nWestchester County in her Sixth Cause of Action. However, the parties did not bother to brief the State law\nissues, and because the search violated written County policy, the County may have a defense to liability,\ndepending on a jury's findings about custom and practice. Therefore, summary judgement is not warranted on the\nPlaintiff's Sixth Cause of Action, either.\n\nVI. New York Does Not Recognize A Negligence Claim on These Facts,\nSo Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment Dismissing the\nSeventh Cause of Action\n277 Plaintiff's seventh and last cause of action purports to sound in negligence. *277 However, false arrest, false\nimprisonment and unconstitutional search (or its attendant torts, assault and battery) are not acts of negligence,\nand plaintiff cannot recover for them under general principles of negligence law. Shea v. County of Erie, 202\nA.D.2d 1028, 609 N.Y.S.2d 473 (4th Dept. 1994); Russo v. Village of Port Chester, 198 A.D.2d 408, 603 N.Y.S.2d\n582 (2nd Dept.1993); Stalteri v. County of Monroe, 107 A.D.2d 1071, 486 N.Y.S.2d 555 (4th Dept.1985); Boose v.\nCity of Rochester, 71 A.D.2d 59, 421 N.Y.S.2d 740 (4th Dept. 1979). Defendants are entitled to summary\njudgment dismissing this claim.\nCONCLUSION\nPlaintiff is granted summary judgment against defendant McGurn on her Third Cause of Action and on her Fifth\nCause of Action as related to the strip search. Defendants are granted summary judgment dismissing the First,\n[10]\n Second, and Seventh Causes of Action, and the remainder of the Fifth Cause of Action. The cross-motions\nfor summary judgment on the Fourth and Sixth Causes of Action against Westchester County are denied.\nThe parties are directed to contact the Court with dates when they are available to try the issue of County liability\nand damages.\nThis constitutes the decision and order of the Court.\n[1] Detective Rowan testified that he observed the four individuals to appear to exit the parking lot together. He\nalso claims to have seen the three men \"high five\" each other. As plaintiff disputes these contentions, I ignore\nthem for purposes of the motion. It is undisputed that there was at least a brief interaction in the parking lot.\nPlaintiff's Rule 56.1 Statement, p. 16.\n[2] The field report states as follows: \nOn the above date [4/26/01], at approximately 1800 hours, this writer read suspect, Cruz-Katz his Miranda\nWarning. This took place in the writer's vehicle at the scene of the Cruz-Katz arrest, in the Village of Tarry-town.\nSubject Cruz-Katz was then asked if he would cooperate, which he then stated yes to this writer that he would. At\nthis time, I asked subject Cruz-Katz who gave him the five thousand (5,000) pills of ecstacy, subject Cruz-Katz\nstated Mike. I asked if Mike came up in the silver Durango, he stated yes. Subject Cruz-Katz also stated that\nsubject Mike followed his vehicle from Brooklyn because Mike wanted his money for the five thousand pills. (PX\n4)\n[3] It is also irrelevant whether Cruz-Katz told police officers that he spoke with his supplier during the ride from\nBrooklyn on the street or later, at the police headquarters. While this information would cement the question of\nprobable cause, the dispute of when it was communicated is not material, because the information that was\nindisputably available to the arresting officers was legally sufficient. See United States v. Patrick, discussed\nbelow.\n[4] In both Murcia and Dodge, this court noted that the Supreme Court itself has held that \"the assumption that a\n`felon' is more dangerous than a misdemeanant\" is \"untenable\" Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 14, 105 S.Ct.\n1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)cited in Dodge, 209 F.R.D. at 73,Murcia, 2002 WL 31245264, at *4.\n[5] Sgt. McGurn's terminology is confusing, to say the least. He agreed in his deposition that the \"ordinary\ndefinition of [the] term [strip search]\" includes having the subject remove all of their clothes, then telling them to\nturn around and bend over. (McGurn Deposition, p. 67, line 23-25; p. 68, line 1-2). He differentiates this from a\n\n\"cavity search,\" which he defines as \"someone checking the person's cavities for narcotics.\" (McGurn Deposition,\np. 68, lines 3-8). He apparently does not consider it a \"cavity search\" when a naked woman is asked to bend over\n00 a maneuver that has but one purpose: to better expose the anal area to visual inspection. \n97\nThe decision in this case rests not on linguistics, but on the acts authorized by Sgt. McGurn. However, I note that\nthe case law reveals stark and significant discrepancies in the definitions of terms such as \"strip search\" and\n\"body cavity search.\" Compare, e.g., Dodge v. County of Orange, 209 F.R.D. 65, 69 (S.D.N.Y.2002),with \nGonzalez v. City of Schenectady, 141 F.Supp.2d 304, 306 n. 3 (N.D.N.Y.2001). It is obvious that there is a\npressing need for clarity and uniformity in the terminology used to describe strip searches, so that courts and\nofficials share an understanding of what is permissible under the Fourth Amendment. See William J. Simonitsch, \nVisual Body Cavity Searches Incident to Arrest: Validity Under the Fourth Amendment, 54 U.Miami L.Rev. 665\n(2000)(discussing the confusing linguistics in strip search jurisprudence, and calling for uniformity).\n[6] The facts of both Campbell and Elk provided more compelling bases for individualized reasonable suspicion\nthan the facts here. In Campbell, during the execution of a search warrant pursuant to a joint federal/state drug\ninvestigation, plaintiff was found in a non-public place (the basement of a store) that had been the site of the\nstash in at least one of several controlled buys made by the DEA. Also, he may or may not have conformed to the\ndescription of a man whose search was specifically authorized by the warrant. And in Elk, the plaintiff was taken\nfrom a vehicle redolent of marijuana, and from close proximity to a canister of marijuana. Here, on the view of the\nfacts most favorable to plaintiff, Sarnicola did no more than drive a car and be seen in conversation with the seller\nand his supplier. On the best view of the facts for defendant, Sarnicola overheard conversations about the deal\nwhile she was in the Durango. None of that suggests that she was concealing drugs on her person.\n[7] Following the submission of briefs, the Court asked for additional briefing on a different constitutional issue,\nwhich had not previously been raised by either side: whether McGurn should have obtained a warrant prior to\nconducting a strip search of plaintiff incident to her lawful arrest, under the reasoning of Schmerber v. California,\n384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). Defendant responded that the holding in Schmerber had no\nbearing on this case. I disagree. \"Strip searches,\" particularly those that include visual searches into body\ncavities, areas like the anus, implicate the human dignity and privacy interests that the Supreme Court was\nconcerned about in Schmerber. However, because I conclude that the search was unconstitutional based on a\nlack of individualized reasonable suspicion, and find that McGurn is not entitled to qualified immunity as a matter\nof law, I dispose of this case without ever reaching the fascinating 00 and difficult 00 question of wether the search\n97 97\nwas also unconstitutional under Schmerber.\n[8] New York State does not recognize the doctrine of qualified immunity in connection with constitutional torts\ncommitted by State officers.\n[9] Although both parties brief the excessive detention issue, it is hard to know exactly what those claims are to\nbe found in the amended complaint. Plaintiff does not assert a separate cause of action for excessive detention.\nIt may fall under her first cause of action, which alleges that unspecified \"acts and practices\" as described in the\ncomplaint violate her constitutional rights. Indeed, since the second cause of action alleges false arrest and third\nalleges strip search without probable cause, any excessive detention claim that purports to be brought under\nSection 1983 would have to fall within the ambit of the first cause of action (which is otherwise redundant).\nPlaintiff's state law false imprisonment claim (Fifth Cause of Action) may also be intended to encompass her\nallegation of excessive detention. Wherever it is lodged, it fails.\n[10] To the extent that the First Cause of Action, which asserts in general terms that plaintiff's constitutional rights\nwere violated, encompasses her claim of unlawful strip search, it is dismissed as duplicative of the Third Cause\nof Action.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.\nSECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n32.  At all relevant times the individually named County defendants acted in\ngood faith and in accordance with laws, rules and regulations and pursuant to their\nstatutory authority and obligation and as such are entitled to qualified immunity.\nTHIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n33.  Punitive damages are not recoverable against the County.\nn\n\nn FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE ,|\n34.  Insofar as plaintiff seeks to impute liability to the County of Westchester,\nsimply because it is alleged to have employed one or more constitutional tortfeasers, this\naction should be dismissed since the doctrine of respondeat superior is not available in an\naction brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.\nFIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n35.  Any action, which is alleged by plaintiff, is de minimis and insubstantial\nand as such the allegations fail to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.\nSIXTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n36.  If plaintiff suffered any injuries, such injuries were not the result of a\npattern, practice, policy or custom of the County and were not the result of any action\nn taken by defendants acting under color of state law.\nSEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n37.  Plaintiff has failed to allege and cannot establish facts necessary to show a\nmunicipal policy and therefore the complaint should be dismissed.\nEIGHTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n38.  At all times relevant hereto, County defendants acted in good faith and took\nappropriate action in the discharge of their duties.\nNINTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n39.  That if the plaintiff was caused to sustain damages at the time and place set\nforth in the plaintiffs complaint said damages were caused by the plaintiffs own culpable\nconduct, carelessness, recklessness or by reason of the culpable conduct, carelessness,\nO\n\nrecklessness and negligence of a third party over which the answering defendants have no\nM\ncontrol.\nTENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n40.  The plaintiff is precluded from asserting any state pendent claims as the\nplaintiff has failed to satisfy a condition precedent to the filing of such claims against the\nCounty defendants and therefore the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to entertain\nsuch state claims.\nELEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n41.  The plaintiff has failed to allege any basis and no basis exists in fact for the\naward of punitive damages in this case.\nn TWELFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n42.  The plaintiff has failed to allege and no basis exists in fact for the award of\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief.\nTHIRTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n43.

      "text": "PRELIMINARY STATEMENT  €\nH  *\n1  Defendants, The County of Westchester, and Sergeant Thomas McGura,\ni\nI  individually and in his official capacity, hereinafter (County defendants) by their\nattorney, Charlene M. Indelicato, Westchester County Attorney, Jane Hogan Felix,\nSenior Assistant County Attorney, of counsel submit this memorandum of law in support\nof their Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure (\"FRCP\").\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nFor a statement of material facts, County defendants respectfully refer this\nHonorable Court to their Rule 56.1 Statement.\nARGUMENT\nrTi  POINT I\nr\ni  COUNTY DEFENDANTS ARE ENTITLED TO\n|  JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW BECAUSE PROBABLE CAUSE\nEXISTED FOR THE ARREST, DETENTION AND STRIP SEARCH OF THE\nPLAINTIFF\nI\nj  Summary judgment should be granted if the evidence demonstrates that there are\nno genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.  The mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties\nwill not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment.\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986).  The\nsubstantive law identifies the facts, which are material for each cause of action.  Id. at\n250.\nn\nSarnicola v. County of Westchester\n1\nPN-NY-002-008\n\nThe party opposing summary judgment must establish the odstence of every\nelement essential to its case on which the party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  The burden of the party resisting\nsummary judgment will not be satisfied by some metaphysical doubt as to the material\nfacts, conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions or only a scintilla of evidence.\nThese types of allegations are clearly insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact.\nMatsushita Electrical Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.. 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986);\nCifarelli v. Village of Babylon. 93 F.3d 47, 51 (2d Cir. 1996). A party may not rely on\nmere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for\nsummary judgment.  Knight v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co. 804 F.2d 9, 12 (2d. Cir. 1986)\n\"Summary judgment is a tool to winnow out from the trial calendar those cases whose\n--  facts predestine them to result in a directed verdict.\"  United National Ins. Co. v. Tunnel,\n( I\nInc., 988 F.2d 351, 355 (2d Cir. 1993).\nAlso, it is well settled in this Circuit that a party is not permitted to create his or\nher own genuine issue of material fact simply by presenting contradictory or unsupported\nstatements; and the existence of a disputed fact will not prevent the granting of a motion\nfor summary judgment unless the disputed fact is material.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317 (1986); Mack v. United States. 814 F.2d 120, 124-25 (2d Cir. 1987); Burlington\nCoat Factory Warehouse Corp. v. Esprit De Corp.. 769 F.2d 919, 923 (2d. Cir. 1985);\nSEC v. Research Automation Corp.. 585 F.2d 31, 33-34 (2d Cir. 1978)\nAs demonstrated below, the County defendants' motion should be granted based\nupon the pleadings, the deposition testimony, the undisputed facts and the applicable law.\n\n^-v  Here, the County defendants are entitled to summary judgment, as there are no\ndisputed issues of facts, which would prevent the Court from concluding that probable\ncause, existed for the arrest, detention and strip search of the plaintiff.\nPROBABLE CAUSE\n\"Probable cause to arrest a person exists if the law enforcement official, on\nthe basis of the totality of the circumstances, has sufficient knowledge or reasonably\ntrustworthy information to justify a person of reasonable caution in believing that an\noffense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.\"  United States v\nMichios, Rivera and DaSilva. 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23534;  (Hogan Felix Declaration\nExhibit \"M\") Dunway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200, 60 L.Ed. 2d 824, 99 S.Ct. 2248\n(1979); United States v. Patrick, 899 F.2d 169, 171 (2d Cir. 1990). The defendant bears\no_^  the burden of establishing that his actions were justified based on probable cause.  (See\nRaysor v. Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, 768 F.2d 34 (2d Cir. 1985) To\nmeet that burden the defendant must show that he had a quantum of evidence which\namounted to \"more than a rumor, suspicion, or even a strong reason to suspect\".  United\nStates v. Fisher, 702 F. 2d 372 (2d cir. 1983)\nIt is also important to note, however, that probable cause requires neither a prima\nfacie showing of criminal activity nor a showing that evidence of a crime will, more\nlikely than not, be found.  United States v. Cruz, 834 F.2d 47 (2d Cir. 1987) Probable\ncause requires only the possibility of criminal activity or the possibility that evidence of a\ncrime will be found.  Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730 (1983).  Moreover, in determining\nwhether probable cause exists, the experience and expertise of the law enforcement\nn\n\nagents should be taken into consideration.  United States v. Perea.?848 F. Supp. 1101\n(E.D.N.Y. 1994)\nIn the instant case the officer had sufficient information to believe that probable\ncause existed for the arrest, detention and subsequent strip search of the plaintiff.\nSergeant McGurn was in charge of the field \"buy and bust\" drug operation on April 26,\n2001.  He was an officer with nearly thirty years of police experience and seven years of\nexperience as a narcotics officer.  Sergeant McGurn remained in constant, direct\ncommunication with all of the other officers who were assigned to the detail.  Further, he\nwas entitled to rely on the information provided to him by fellow police officers.  Bernard\nv. United States, 25 F. 3d 98, 102-3 (2d Cir, 1994); Martinez v. Simonetti et. al.. 202 F.\n3d 625.\nSergeant McGurn personally participated in three prior drug transactions between\nundercover police officer, Detective Christopher Kelly, and Gabriel Name Redacted  On the\nday of the arrest, Sergeant McGurn was advised by one of his surveillance officers, that a\nsecond vehicle containing three passengers was following the Name Redacted vehicle as Name Redacted\n was traveling to meet the undercover officer.  Sergeant McGurn formulated the\nimpression that it was probable that the second vehicle contained the drug supplier who\nhad followed the drugs to the transaction to ensure that he received his money.  He\nremembered a similar incident involving the third drug transaction, which involved a\nsmaller amount of drugs and money, where Name Redacted was observed meeting with a man\nin Tarrytown just prior to meeting the undercover officer and then was observed\nreturning to meet the same man immediately after consummating the drug deal.  Sergeant\nMcGurn opined, as did Sergeant Buonanno of the Tarrytown Police Department, that\n\n_  such activity was \"textbook\", meaning that in their experience drug^leals often occur in\nthis manner.\nOn the day of the arrest, Sergeant McGurn observed the Name Redacted vehicle pull\ninto the parking lot where he and other officers were parked in undercover police\nvehicles.  He observed a silver Dodge Durango; being driven by the plaintiff, pull into the\nparking lot immediately behind the Name Redacted vehicle and park adjacent to the vehicle.\nDetective Rowan, who was in a different location in the parking lot, reported the\ndescription of the three individuals who exited the Durango over his police radio to\nSergeant McGurn and all other units.  Name Redacted was observed to exit his vehicle and\nstand by the trunk apparently waiting for the three occupants of the Durango to exit their\nvehicle.  The plaintiff, along with the two other occupants, (later identified to be Michael\nTricardo and Frank Rossi) had a brief conversation with Name Redacted in the parking lot.\nMichael Tricardo had been seated in the front passenger seat and Frank Rossi had been\nseated in the rear.  Detective Rowan observed all four subjects apparently exiting the\nparking lot together and reported such information to Sergeant McGurn.\nMoments later the undercover officer spotted Name Redacted in his side view mirror.\nThe officer believed Name Redacted was walking with the plaintiff and Frank Rossi and that\nthe three were engaged in conversation.  Undercover officer, Detective Kelly, next\nobserved the plaintiff and Frank Rossi look into the undercover vehicle as Name Redacted was\ngetting in the vehicle.  Detective Kelly and Name Redacted consummated the drug deal and\nName Redacted was arrested.\nAfter the arrest of Name Redacted Detective Kelly told Sergeant McGurn that he had\nobserved the plaintiff walking and talking to Name Redacted and Rossi just prior to Name Redacted\n\ngetting into his vehicle.  He volunteered to search for the plaintiff a£d Rossi because he\nbelieved he could readily identify them.  Sergeant McGurn immediately began to\nquestion Name Redacted about the identities of the three occupants of the Durango.  After\nwaving Miranda rights, Name Redacted confirmed Sergeant McGurn's suspicion and advised\nhim that Tricardo was his drug supplier.  According to Name Redacted Tricardo insisted on\nfollowing Name Redacted to the site of the drug deal because of the amount of money\ninvolved. Name Redacted further stated that he and Tricardo had talked on the cell phone\nrepeatedly on the way from Brooklyn to Tarrytown during which time Tricardo dictated\nhow the drug deal should take place and that it should happen quickly. Name Redacted further\nadvised Sergeant McGurn that when the four conversed in the parking lot prior to the\ndrug deal, Tricardo, once again, reiterated that the deal should happen quickly.\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, as outlined above, Sergeant McGurn\nordered that the plaintiff be arrested and detained pending further investigation.  Clearly\nthe officer had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff under the circumstances of this case.\nWhile it is established law that \"a person's mere propinquity to others independently\nsuspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause, Ybarra\nv. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 91, 62 L.Ed. 2d 238, 100 S.Ct. 338 (1979), the known\ncircumstances tying the plaintiff to the drug transaction for which she was arrested were\nsubstantially more than a \"mere propinquity\" to another suspect.  Unlike in Ybarra, where\nthe defendant was arrested based solely on his presence in a public place, the plaintiff\nhere transported the drug supplier from Brooklyn to the site of the drug transaction.  She\nwas present when the drug transaction was discussed during cell phone communications\nand during a final conversation minutes prior to Name Redacted entering the under cover's\nn\n\nvehicle.  It was reasonable for Sergeant McGurn to conclude that tjje plaintiff was a\nknowing participant in the drug transaction.  The information provided to Sergeant\nMcGurn by Detective Rowan and under cover officer, Detective Kelly, that the plaintiff\nwas walking and talking with Name Redacted up until the moment he entered the under cover's\nvehicle and that she looked in the vehicle as she walked by the under cover's vehicle,\nadded to the reasonable impression of the plaintiffs participatory involvement.\nAs the Supreme Court has explained the evidence \"must be seen and weighed not\nin terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of\nlaw enforcement\".  United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418, 66 L.Ed. 2d 621, 101 S.\nCt. 690 (1981) Sergeant McGurn was entitled to rely on his experience in the field and to\nreasonably conclude that the presence of the plaintiff and others, in the company of Name Redacted\n under the circumstances, was consistent with the manner in which drug transactions\ngenerally occur.  (See Perea, Supra.)  Detective Pierro and Detective Rowan both testified\nthat in their experience it was not unusual for the drug seller to arrive on the scene with\nadditional people to act as lookouts or to be armed with weapons.  Detective Pierro\nacknowledged that it was for that very reason that he and Detective Bravo were armed\nwith shotguns.  Detective Kelly testified that the large number of officers present as\nmembers of his backup team were necessary for his safety and security as well as the\nsafety and security of the general public. .\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Martinez-Molina\nobserved \"we do not think officers in the field are required to divorce themselves from\nreality or to ignore the fact that criminals rarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses\nto serious crimes and rarely seek to perpetrate felonies before larger than necessary\n\naudiences\".  United States v. Martinez-Molina. 64 F. 3d 719, 729 (l|t Cir. 1995).\nSimilarly, the Court in United States v. Baltodano. 2000 U.S. App. Lexis 6692 (9th Cir.\n2000) found probable cause to arrest a passenger in a vehicle loaded with a commercial\nquantity of marijuana.  The Court recognized that \"the border agents' experience\nindicated that drug dealers do not normally carry out their criminal activity without the\nknowledge of all persons present\".\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District\nCourt's decision in United States v. Patrick, 899 F.2d 169, (2d Cir. 1990) by easily\ndistinguishing the case from Ybarra's \"mere propinquity\" doctrine.  The Court found that\nthe Customs officials knew much more about Patrick than just his \"propinquity\" to\nTaylor, a person for whom they had probable cause to make an arrest.  The Court found\nthat the officials observed the two enter the Customs office together, both carrying\nknapsacks, at a time when no other pedestrians were around.  The two both told a similar\nstory about accidentally crossing the border into Canada.  Once cocaine was found in\nTaylor's knapsack the Court opined that the totality of the circumstances known to the\nCustom officials at the time provided an adequate basis for the officials to reasonably\nbelieve that Patrick was not just a mere innocent traveling companion but was traveling\nand acting in concert with Taylor in transporting cocaine.\nIn the instant case, Sergeant McGurn's suspicions about the plaintiffs\ninvolvement in the drug transaction, which were initially justifiably based on his\nexperience in the field, were unquestionably confirmed by the information obtained from\nName Redacted within minutes of his arrest.  Accordingly, his decision to arrest the plaintiff\nwas justified as having been based on probable cause to believe that the plaintiff was\nO\n\nengaged in criminal activity.  Consequently plaintiffs second cai$e of action should be\ndismissed.\nLENGTH OF DETENTION\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the freedom\nfrom \"unreasonable\" seizures.  (Untied States Constitution, Amendment IV).  Plaintiff\nchallenges the length of her detention in the fifth cause of action of her complaint.  The\nlength of the plaintiffs detention (approximately three hours and forty minutes) was\nreasonable under the totality of the circumstances in this case.  Plaintiff was initially\ntaken into custody and brought to the Westchester County Department of Public Safety\nHeadquarters at approximately 7:00 P.M. She was thereafter released to the lobby of the\npolice headquarters at approximately 10:40 P.M.  During the intervening time period she\no was processed, searched and questioned. The three other individuals, who were taken into\ncustody with her, were also questioned.  Her statement was completed and signed at 8:45\nP.M. By approximately 10:40 P.M. the plaintiff had collected all of her belongings and\nwas waiting in the reception area of the police headquarters.  Detective Pierro and\nDetective Antonecchia, who were part of a team of officers dispatched to Brooklyn to\nconduct a search of Tricardo's apartment, ultimately drove her back to Brooklyn.\nAccordingly, the length of her detention was not unreasonable under the totality of the\ncircumstances of this case.\nSTRIP SEARCH\nAs an invasive procedure, a strip search requires probable cause.  Dunwav.\nNew York, Supra., Rivera v. United States, 928 F.2d 592 (2d Cir. 1991); Walsh v.\nFranco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d Cir. 1988); M.M. v. Anker, 607 F2d 588, 589 (2d Cir. 1979)\n\nArrestees have a right, absent a reasonable suspicion of concealmenj of drugs or\ncontraband, not to be subjected to a search by prison officials.  Weber v. Dell, 804 F2d\n796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986), cert denied 483 U.S. 1020 (1987).  The suspicion justifying the\nsearch must arise from the nature of the charge or the circumstances of the arrest.  United\nStates v. Montova De Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 87 L.Ed. 2d 381, 105 S. Ct. 3304 (1985)\nIn the instant case, the plaintiff was arrested based on the reasonable suspicion\nthat she had knowingly participated in the sale of a substantial amount of narcotic drug\nknown as ecstasy.  It was reasonable for the officers to believe that based upon the\ncircumstances the plaintiff could have secreted both a weapon and contraband on her\nperson.  Under the circumstances of this case, the nature of the crime for which the\nplaintiff was taken into custody, as well as the proven ability of drug dealers to secrete\ncontraband on their persons the instant strip search did not violate the plaintiffs\nconstitutional rights.  (See Weber v. Dell, Supra., Campbell v.  Fernandez 54 F. Supp. 2d\n195.  Moreover the circumstances of the search were not unreasonable.  The plaintiff was\ntaken to a secluded area outside of the view of any other individuals.  A female officer\nwho did not make any physical contact with the plaintiff searched her.  Accordingly, the\nplaintiffs third cause of action should be dismissed.\nPOINT II\nTHE STATE CAUSES OF ACTION FOR FALSE ARREST AND FALSE\nIMPRISONMENT SHOULD BE DISMISSED AS THE POLICE ACTIONS\nWERE BASED UPON PROBABLE CAUSE\nTo the extent that plaintiff alleges false arrest and false imprisonment in the\nsecond cause of action, they are considered synonymous causes of action.  (See Posr v.\nn Dohertv, 944 F. 2d 91, 96 (2d Cir. 1991). The elements necessary to state a claim for\n10\n\nIi-n-v  false arrest under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 are the same as those necejfeary to state a claim\nfor false arrest under New York State law.  Wevant v. Okst. 101 F.3d 845, 852 (2d Cir.\n1996) To state a claim for false arrest under New York State law, a plaintiff must show\nthat: (1) the defendant intentionally confined the plaintiff (2) the plaintiff was conscious\nof the confinement (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement (4) the\nconfinement was not otherwise justified.  (See Posr, Sup_ra.) The existence of probable\ncause to arrest is a complete defense to an action for false arrest.  Bernard v. United\nStates, 25 F. 3d 98, 102 (2d Cir. 1994).  As set forth in the arguments outlined above, the\nofficer had probable cause to believe that the plaintiff had engaged in the commission of\na crime.  Accordingly, her state claim of false arrest and false imprisonment contained in\nthe sixth cause of action must be dismissed.\nn POINT III\nTHE CLAIMS AGAINST THE COUNTY SHOULD BE DISMISSED\nBECAUSE EVEN IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THE PLAINTIFF'S\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED THERE IS NO EVIDENCE\nTHAT A COUNTY POLICY OR PRACTICE CAUSED THE VIOLATION OF\nTHE PLAINTIFF'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\nPlaintiffs first and fourth causes of action appear to assert claims based upon\nthe alleged existence of a County policy or practice which caused the deprivation of\nher constitutional rights.  It is well settled that when a municipality is to be held liable\nfor violation of an individual's constitutional rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section\n1983, it must be established that an employee was acting pursuant to an officially\nadopted municipal policy or custom.  Monell v. New York City Department of Social\nn Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018 (1978); Zanghi v. Incorporated Village of Old\nBrookville, 752 F.2d 42 (2d Cir. 1985).  Since plaintiff has failed to establish a\n\nviolation of her constitutional rights as a result of her arrest, detent^n and strip search,\nshe lacks standing to challenge the policies and practices of Westchester County\n:  Department of Public Safety.  Dietz v. Damas, 932 F. Supp 459.\nAssuming arguendo, that the Court finds a constitutional violation, the record\nis devoid of any evidence demonstrating that any such County policy resulted in the\ni\nI  deprivation of the plaintiffs rights. The policy of a municipality must be either\nexpress, Monell, supra, or inferred from a single decision taken by the highest official\nresponsible for setting policy in that area of municipal business.  City of St. Louis v.\nPraprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S. Ct. 915 (1988).  In the absence of such a policy,\nplaintiffs must demonstrate a custom or practice of the municipality by establishing\nfacts outside their own case constituting similar unconstitutional conduct.  Thurman v.\nTorrington, 595 F. Supp. 1521 (D. Conn. 1984). To amount to a custom or practice,\n0\nthere must be a persistent pattern or practice by municipal officials, which is \"so\nwidespread as to have the force of law.\"  Board of the County Commissioners of\nBryan County, Oklahoma v. Brown et al., 117 S. Ct. 1382, rehearing denied, 117 S.Ct.\n2472 (1997)Turpinv.Mailet 619 F.2d 196, 199 (2d Cir.), cert denied, 449 U.S. 1016\n(1980) (emphasis added).\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly in this case, plaintiff must\nestablish that the policy or custom is causally related to the alleged constitutional\ndeprivation.  Monell v New York City Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. at\n2036.  As stated previously, a municipality cannot be held liable solely because it\nn\nemploys a tortfeasor, and traditional notions of respondeat superior do not apply to\nactions against a municipality under Section 1983. Id.; See also, Dominguez v.\n12\n\nn  Beame, 603 F.2d 337 (1979), cert, denied, 446 U.S. 917 (1980).  ^Mnunicipality will\nonly be held liable under Section 1983 if  \"deliberate action attributable to the\nmunicipality itself is the 'moving force' behind the plaintiffs deprivation of federal\nrights.\"  Board of the County Commissioners of Bryan County, Oklahoma v. Brown et\naL, 117 S. Ct. at 1388.  Indeed, \"[w]here a plaintiff claims that the municipality has\nnot directly inflicted an injury, but nonetheless has caused an employee to do so,\nrigorous standards of culpability and causation must be applied to ensure that the\nmunicipality is not held liable solely for the actions of its employees. \"  Id. at 1389\n(citations omitted).\nAt the outset, plaintiff has failed to allege, except in a conclusory fashion, that\na municipal policy or custom caused the alleged constitutional violations here.  Even\nn assuming this single incident (the alleged arrest, detention and strip search of the\nplaintiff) was unconstitutional, it is insufficient to support plaintiffs' claim of a policy\nor custom.  The record in this case is devoid of any information, which would support\nthe conclusion that the plaintiffs rights were violated as a result of a persistent pattern\nor practice of the County of Westchester.  Certainly the record reflects no express\npolicy of Westchester County Department of Public Safety to make arrests on less\nthan a probable cause standard.  The County's policy on strip-searching certain\narrestees is consistent with applicable law. Rather, the record reflects a policy, which\nis Constitutionally sound.  Bare assertions, in the absence of any evidence of the\nexistence of a policy or practices, which were so persistent as to constitute custom or\nn usage, are insufficient to create an issue of fact.  Amato v. City of Saratoga Springs,\n972 F. Supp. 120, 127 (N.D.N.Y. 1997)\n13\n\nT\n^—^  In light of the foregoing failure of plaintiff to attribute the purported constitutional\nviolations directly to a municipal policy or custom, plaintiffs first and fourth causes of\naction must be dismissed.\nTHERE IS NO CAUSE OF ACTION EMINATING FROM THE CLAIM\nOF NEGLIGENT ARREST\nThere is no independent cause of action under New York law for the negligent\narrest and prosecution of an individual.  Shea v County of Erie, 202 AD2d 1028, (4th\nDept. 1979); Staltieri v County of Monroe, 107 AD2d 1071; Boose v Rochester, 71\nAD2d 59.  Consequently all negligence claims asserted by plaintiff in her seventh cause\nof action, relative to her arrest must be dismissed.\nQUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nn\nQualified Immunity is available if it was objectively reasonable for the officer to\nbelieve his acts were not unconstitutional.  Anderson v. Creighton 483 U.S. 635, 638, 97\nL. Ed. 2d 523, 107 S. Ct. 3034 (1987); Frank v. Relin 1 F. 3d 1317 (2d Cir. 1993).  When\na valid defense of qualified immunity is raised, summary judgment is appropriate to\neliminate merit less actions against public officials at early stages in the litigation.\nMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411, 105 S. Ct 2806 (1985).\nSummary judgment is appropriate in the context of this case if it can be\ndemonstrated that reasonable officers could have disagreed that probable cause existed\nfor the arrest, detention and strip search of the plaintiff.  Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641.\nEven evidence insufficient to sustain a finding of probable cause may be adequate to\n(I  show qualified immunity.  \"The question of immunity remains, as it should, distinct from\n14\n\no the question of probable cause.\"  Warren v. Dwyer. 906 F. 2d 70^75 (2d. Cir. 1990)  The\ndefense of qualified immunity protects all but the \"plainly incompetent or those who\nknowingly violate the law.\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335,341, 89 L.Ed. 2d 271, 106 S.\nCt. 1092 (1986) While the subjective beliefs of the defendant are not to be considered on\na qualified immunity determination \"for the purposes of qualified immunity and arguable\nprobable cause, police officers are entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts\nthey possess at the time of the seizure based upon their own experiences\".  Cerrone v.\nCahill, 246 F. 3d. 194, 202, (2d Cir. 2001) In other words, the \"court must evaluate the\nobjective reasonableness of the officer's conduct in light of clearly established law and\nthe information the officers possessed.\"  Cerrone v Cahill, 246 F. 3d at 202.\nThe officer must show that (a) it was objectively reasonable to believe that\nn\nprobable cause existed, or (b) that officers of reasonable competence could disagree on\nwhether the probable cause test was met.  Elk v. Townson, 839 F. Supp 1047; Anderson\nv. Creighton, 483 U.S. at 641. Under the circumstances of this case, the totality of\ninformation known to Sergeant McGurn at the time of the plaintiffs arrest was enough to\nsupport probable cause.  If the Court finds that probable cause did not exist, it is\nrespectfully suggested that reasonable officers could have disagreed as to the existence of\nprobable cause.  In fact, Detective Pierro, Sgt. Buonanno, Detective Kelly and Detective\nAntonnechia all testified that in their opinion the plaintiff was a knowing participant in\nthe criminal activity and that probable cause existed for her arrest.\nMoreover, based upon all of the information available to Sergeant McGurn at the\nn time of the plaintiffs arrest, it cannot be said that Sergeant McGurn's \"judgment was so\nflawed that no reasonable officer would have made a similar choice.\"  Lennon v. Miller,\n15\n\no\nF. 3d 416, 425 (2d Cir. 1995).  Accordingly, even if the Court find^that the plaintiffs\nConstitutional rights were violated, Sergeant McGurn in entitled to summary judgment\nbased upon the principles of qualified immunity.\nCONCLUSION\nIt is respectfully requested that this Honorable Court grant the County defendants'\nmotion for summary judgment dismissing the action in its entirety, together with costs,\nfees, disbursement, and for such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems\njust and proper.\nDated:  White Plains, New York\nn February 6, 2002\nRespectfully submitted,\nCHARLENE M.

County of Westchester\nPN-NY-002-011\nn\nIN THE UNITED STATE DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nNICOLE SARNICOLA,\nPLAINTIFF  01 Civ 6078 (CM)(MDF)\nDECLARATION AND\nvs  AFFIRMATION OF\nJAMES I. MEYERSON\nTHE COUNTY OF WESTCHESTER, etc.,\net al.,\nDEFENDANTS\nJames I. Meyerson, being duly admitted to practice law in and\nbefore the Courts of the State of New York among others and being\nduly admitted to practice law in and before this Court among others\nand being duly aware of the penalties for perjury and being duly\naware  of  the  sanctions  which  this  Court  may  impose  for  the\nviolation of its Rules, affirms under penalty of law and declares\nunder the threat of the imposition of sanction by this Court for\nthe violation of its Rules as follows:\n1.  I am the attorney for the Plaintiff.\n2.  I have prepared the Plaintiff's papers in Opposition to\nthe Defendant' Motion for Summary Judgment.  I have also prepared\nthe Plaintiff  papers  in support of a Cross Motion  for  Summary\nJudgment.\n3.  I believe, in good  faith, that the Defendants are not\nentitled  to summary  judgment. On the other hand  and based  on a\nsignificant number of undisputed relevant material facts, I believe\nthat the Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on\nthe various claims which she has asserted in this litigation.\n4.  There are some fact disputes. Such disputes relate to a\nnarrow universe of information which Defendant McGurn claims that\nhe was  aware  of  at  the  time  that  he  directed  the  Plaintiff's\narrest.  To the extent that such information changes the equation\nfor assessing the probable cause [and I do not believe that, even\nwith that information, such would change the outcome in Plaintiffs\nfavor], then, it is submitted, the matter must be submitted to a\njury for a resolution of those fact disputes.\nn\n5.  On the basic facts which are not disputed  and  placing\naside the limited facts which are disputed [relative to information\n\nn which Defendant McGurn asserts he had at the tijne he directed the\nPlaintiff's  arrest],  Defendant  McGurn  has  testified  that  he\nbelieved  that  he  had  sufficient  probable  cause  to  arrest  the\nPlaintiff and he would have arrested her. On that information which\nis  not  disputed,  Plaintiff  submits  that,  as  a  matter  of  law,\nDefendant McGurn did not have a probable cause basis to arrest her.\nAccordingly, on that information, judgment should be entered as a\nmatter of law for the Plaintiff  [on her false arrest claim].\n6.  Moreover in that regard, the Plaintiff believes that the\ndisputed  information should  be discounted  and disregarded,  as a\nmatter  of  law,  since  it  is  not  documented  in  any  of  the\ncontemporaneous 4/26/01 field reports; and, therefore, as a matter\nof law, it cannot now be advanced to bolster the information base\nwhich was available to McGurn at the time that he subjected the\nPlaintiff to an arrest.\n7.  Furthermore and based on the uncontested material facts\nand  assuming  that  those  facts  are  the  only  facts  which  are\nrelevant  to  the  probable  cause  inquiry  given  that  on  those\nundisputed material  facts Defendant McGurn has admitted  that he\nwould have arrested the Plaintiff without the disputed information\nbeing factored in, I believe that there was no probable cause for\nthe Plaintiff's arrest and I further believe that no reasonable\npolice officer could have believed that there was probable cause to\narrest the Plaintiff.\nn\n8.  As a matter of fact, based on the testimony of undercover\nOfficer Kelly, the reason for the arrest was and is apparent: [a]\nto take everyone  into custody  no whatever what the evidence of\ncriminal activity against a specific individual  [if any]; [b] to\ninterrogate  everyone  taken  into  custody  [before  booking  and\ncharging anyone];  and [c], then, to sort it all out once everyone\nwas  in  custody.  Such  is an  impermissible  justification  for  an\narrest because the  \"suspicion\" for a \"Terry stop\"  interrogation\ndoes not metastasize into probable cause for a full scale custodial\narrest  and  custodial  interrogation  associated  therewith  simply\nbecause of a generic proximity to individuals for whom there was\nprobable  cause  to  arrest  for  particular  and  specific  criminal\nactivity.\n9.  It is my belief, too, that the strip search to which the\nPlaintiff was subjected by Defendant McGurn pursuant to the County\npolicy, was, as a matter  of  law, unconstitutional  because:  [a]\nthere was no probable cause for the arrest]; and/or  [b] because,\neven  assuming  probable  cause  for  the  arrest,  there  was  no\nindependent basis to believe that the Plaintiff was secreting a\nweapon or contraband or was otherwise a security risk because of\nsomething  which  she was hiding; and/or  [c] because  the policy,\nnonetheless, allowed her to be subjected to the strip search simply\nbecause she was arrested in the context of a drug related situation\nto which she had some proximity and without more.\n\n10.  As  with  the  arrest  and  except  for the  limited  fact\n #\nn disputes  related  to  the  arrest which  may  be  irrelevant  to  the\nanalysis,  there  are  no material  fact  disputes  about  the  strip\nsearch and the circumstances thereof; and, accordingly, it appears\nthat judgment, as a matter of law, is the appropriate vehicle for\nresolving the legality of the search.  On the other hand and to the\nextent that  probable cause is a critical aspect to the resolution\nof the case and the disputed facts are deemed to be relevant [even\nin the context of Defendant McGurn indicating that without them he\nstill would have arrested the Plaintiff and subjected her to the\nstrip  search], then the strip search  issue may best be  left to\nresolution after trial.\n11.  Finally,  with  respect  to  the  Plaintiff's  excessive\ndetention claim, it appears that there are no relevant material\nfact  disputes.  Defendant  McGurn,  who  was  the  individual\nresponsible for her release, indicated that he did not authorize\nthe  Plaintiff's  release  for  approximately  two  hours  after  she\ncompleted her statement at 8:45 P.M.  [the Plaintiff believes that\nit  is closer  to three  hours thereby  proposing  that  there  is a\ndispute about the period post statement detention before she was\nauthorized for release].  On the undisputed relevant and material\nfacts, the Plaintiff believes that, assuming probable cause for her\narrest, nonetheless, she should have been permitted to leave at\n8;45 P.M. when she gave her statement. She was not charged at the\ntime of the completion of her statement; and she was not released\nat that time; and she was not booked or charged. Accordingly and as\nn a  matter  of  law,  the  continued  detention  of  the  Plaintiff  was\nunlawful  and  unconstitutional  and  the  Court, on the  undisputed\nrelevant material facts as described, should so hold.\n12.  I have attached hereto as part of my submission, materials\nrelevant  to  the  claims which  represent  evidence  supporting  the\nuncontested relevant material facts and otherwise endeavoring to\ndiscount, as irrelevant, the facts which are in dispute. If the\nlatter cannot be achieved, then judgment in favor of either party\nwith respect to some of the Plaintiff claims may be required to be\npostponed pending a resolution of those contested facts [if deemed\nrelevant to the probable cause equation].\nDATED: New York, New York\nFebruary 17, 2002\nRespectfully submitted,\nJAMES I.

I am the Plaintiff in this action.\n2.  I  execute  this  Affidavit  in  order  to  provide  some\nadditional  information related to my arrest on April 26, 2001 and\nin order to clarify responses which I gave in my deposition to the\nextent  that,  in  reviewing  my  deposition  transcript,  some\nclarification may be appropriate.\n3.  When I was arrested on the street in Tarrytown, New York\non April 26, 2001, I was not subjected to a frisk or any kind of\nsearch before I was placed in the police vehicle and transported to\na police  facility.\n4.  Until  I was subjected  to the strip  search on April 26,\n2001 at the Westchester  County Police Department  facility, I was\nnever subjected to any kind of search. I was not subjected to any\nkind of frisk search or pat search.\n5.  When I was arrested, I was not given or read any rights;\nand I did not receive any rights until some point in time when I\nwas in the Westchester  County  Police  Department  facility where I\nwas  strip  searched  and  subjected  to  an  interrogation.  My\nrecollection is that, prior to being strip searched, I was given my\nn rights.  I was only  given my rights  once  and it was while  I was\nwaiting  for  the  female  officer  to  arrive  before  I  was  then\nsubjected to the strip search.  I was not given my rights, again,\n\nn at the time that I was interrogated and then wrote out'w$r\nalthough, at the time I wrote out my statement^I did\ndocument related to rights.  However, I was first given the rights-\n-and only given the advisement of my rights, prior to the female\nofficer coming to the facility in order to conduct my strip search.\n6.  When I was approached  by police officers, I was asked\nwhere I was from; and I responded indicating \"Brooklyn\". I was not\nasked my name and I was never asked why I was in Tarrytown or what\nI was doing or what my purpose was in being in Tarrytown.\n7.  During the journey from Brooklyn, New York to Tarrytown,\nMichael Tricardo did speak on his cell telephone. The only thing\nthat I heard him say or ask was when we would arrive.\n8.  When I exited the vehicle in the parking lot in Tarrytown,\nI did not come together with any of the three other  individuals\n[Michael Tricardo, Gabe Name Redacted Frank Rossi].  I did not see any\nhuddle of individuals; and I was not a participant in a huddle type\nconfiguration.\n9.  I did not observe any individuals giving high fives.  I\ndid not give any high five to anyone.\n10.  As I got out of the vehicle, I indicated that I was going\nto  the  bathroom,  having  indicated  that  I needed  to  go  to  the\nn\nbathroom  while I was in the car.\n11.  I asked Frank Rossi if he wanted to go with me and he\nindicated he would.\n12.  I was not part of any other exchange and I did not hear or\nobserve any other exchange between any of the individuals present\nin the parking  lot. I do not even know whether  there were  any\nexchanges between Michael Tricardo and Gabe Name Redacted\n13.  I walked  out of the parking  lot with Frank Rossi.  My\nbelief was that Gabe Name Redacted and Michael Tricardo were in the\nparking lot behind me and Frank Rossi and it was my belief that\nthey would be in or about the parking lot when, after going to the\nbathroom, Frank Rossi and I returned to the parking lot.  My belief\nwas that we would, then, go to a restaurant which, as I understood\nit  from  the  beginning,  was  the  reason  why  we  had  traveled  to\nWestchester  [what I believed was the Yonkers area].\n14. I simply had to go to the bathroom; and I did not think in\nany  manner  or  fashion  about  going  to  the  restaurant  for  that\npurpose. I simply wanted to find a place, where I could go to the\nbathroom, as soon as possible.\n15.  Frank  Rossi  and  I walked  out of the  lot together. We\no exited right and walked about a block to a store which sold tea;\n\nn and it was in that store that I found a bathroop.\n16.  Frank Rossi and I did not walk with Gabe Name Redacted out of\nthe parking lot and we did not walk with him on the street.\n17.  The  last  time  that  I  saw  Gabe Name Redacted  and  Michael\nTricardo they were in the parking lot where I believed I left them\n[at some location] when Frank Rossi and I exited right on to the\nsidewalk and where I expected them to be when I returned with Frank\nRossi from the store where I anticipated going to the bathroom.\n18.  When I was arrested, I was closer to the parking lot than\nto the tea store where I went to the bathroom. At most, I was a\nhalf a block from the parking lot when arrested [maybe not even\nthat distance].\n19.  I did not see either Michael Tricardo or Gabe Name Redacted on\nthe street at any time once I exited the parking lot and I do not\nknow where they were as of the time that I was arrested.\n20.  I never looked into or observed any vehicle when I left\nthe parking lot.\n21.  After I gave my statement at the Westchester County Police\nfacility, I signed it and dated it.  It was approximately 8:45 P.M.\na 22.  When I inquired about whether or when I could leave, I was\ntold \"soon\".  I asked such periodically when or if I could leave;\nand I was continuously told \"soon\".\n23.

I am the Plaintiff in this action.\n2.  I  execute  this  Affidavit  in  order  to  provide  some\nadditional information related to roy arrest on April 26, 2001 and\nin order to clarify responses which I gave in my deposition to the\nextent  that,  in  reviewing  my  deposition  transcript,  some\nclarification may be appropriate.\n3.  When I was arrested on the street in Tarrytown, New York\non April 26, 2001, I was not subjected to a frisk or any kind of\nsearch before I was placed in the police vehicle and transported to\na police facility.\n4.  Until I was subjected to the strip search on April 26,\n2001 at the Westchester County Police Department facility, I was\nnever subjected to any kind of search. I was not subjected to any\nkind of frisk search or pat search.\n5.  When I was arrested, I was not given or read any rights;\nand I did not receive any rights until some point in time when I\nwas in the Westchester County Police Department facility where I\nwas  strip  searched  and  subjected  to  an  interrogation.  My\nrecollection is that, prior to being strip searched, I was given my\nrights. I was only given my rights once and  it was while I was\nn\nwaiting  for  the  female  officer  to  arrive  before  I  was  then\nsubjected to the strip search.  I was not given my rights, again,\n\nn\nat the time that I was interrogated and then wrote out\nalthough, at the time I wrote out my statement7^ I did\ndocument related to rights.  However, I was first given the rights-\n-and only given the advisement of my rights, prior to the female\nofficer coming to the facility in order to conduct my strip search.\n6.  When I was approached  by police officers, I was asked\nwhere I was from; and I responded indicating \"Brooklyn\". I was not\nasked my name and I was never asked why I was in Tarrytown or what\nI was doing or what my purpose was in being in Tarrytown.\n7.  During the journey from Brooklyn, New York to Tarrytown,\nMichael Tricardo did speak on his cell telephone. The only thing\nthat I heard him say or ask was when we would arrive.\n8.  When I exited the vehicle in the parking lot in Tarrytown,\nI did not come together with any of the three other  individuals\n[Michael Tricardo, Gabe Name Redacted Frank Rossi].  I did not see any\nhuddle of individuals; and I was not a participant in a huddle type\nconfiguration.\n9.  I did not observe any individuals giving high fives.  I\ndid not give any high five to anyone.\n10.  As I got out of the vehicle, I indicated that I was going\nto  the  bathroom,  having  indicated  that  I needed  to  go  to  the\nn\nbathroom  while I was in the car.\n11.  I asked Frank Rossi if he wanted to go with me and he\nindicated he would.\n12.  I was not part of any other exchange and I did not hear or\nobserve any other exchange between any of the individuals present\nin the parking  lot. I do not even know whether  there were  any\nexchanges between Michael Tricardo and Gabe Name Redacted\n13.  I walked  out of the parking  lot with Frank Rossi.  My\nbelief was that Gabe Name Redacted and Michael Tricardo were in the\nparking  lot behind me and Frank Rossi and it was my belief that\nthey would be in or about the parking lot when, after going to the\nbathroom, Frank Rossi and I returned to the parking lot.  My belief\nwas that we would, then, go to a restaurant which, as I understood\nit  from  the  beginning,  was  the  reason  why  we  had  traveled  to\nWestchester  [what I believed was the Yonkers area].\n14. I simply had to go to the bathroom; and I did not think in\nany  manner  or  fashion  about  going  to  the  restaurant  for  that\npurpose. I simply wanted to find a place, where I could go to the\nbathroom, as soon as possible.\n15.  Frank  Rossi  and  I walked  out  of the  lot together. We\nn exited right and walked about a block to a store which sold tea;\n\nn and it was in that store that I found a bathroop.\n16.  Frank Rossi and I did not walk with Gabe Name Redacted out of\nthe parking lot and we did not walk with him on the street.\n17.  The  last  time  that  I  saw  Gabe Name Redacted  and  Michael\nTricardo they were in the parking lot where I believed I left them\n[at some location] when Frank Rossi and I exited right on to the\nsidewalk and where I expected them to be when I returned with Frank\nRossi from the store where I anticipated going to the bathroom.\n18.  When I was arrested, I was closer to the parking lot than\nto the tea store where I went to the bathroom. At most, I was a\nhalf a block from the parking lot when arrested [maybe not even\nthat distance].\n19.  I did not see either Michael Tricardo or Gabe Name Redacted on\nthe street at any time once I exited the parking lot and I do not\nknow where they were as of the time that I was arrested.\n20.  I never looked into or observed any vehicle when I left\nthe parking lot.\n21.  After I gave my statement at the Westchester County Police\nfacility, I signed it and dated it.  It was approximately 8:45 P.M.\nn\n22.  When I inquired about whether or when I could leave, I was\ntold \"soon\".  I asked such periodically when or if I could leave;\nand I was continuously told \"soon\".\n23.  It was not until perhaps 11:30 P.M. that I was informed\nthat I could leave and that a ride was available.\n24.  Until I was told that I could  leave at or about 11:30\nP.M., I never believed that I was free to leave.\n25.  I believe that it was unreasonable not to tell me that I\ncould not leave; and I believe that it was unreasonable not to let\nme leave once I had completed the statement at or about 8:45  P.M.\nIf I had been informed that I could leave, I would have left, in a\nheartbeat.  I would have endeavored to locate a train and take the\ntrain back to the City.

We don't know\no\non the scene if the pills could have belonged to Nicole or\nFrank, so they would have been arrested, too, and brought\nback to headquarters to see what their degree of involvement\nwas in the situation.\" (Kelly deposition testimony at page\n79).\nf49a] otherwise put, \"...the totality of all circumstances\nthat occurred, Detective Rowan watched these people get out\nof the vehicle, greet Name Redacted so yes, given these\ncircumstances, all three people if able to be apprehended\nwould be arrested, brought back to headquarters, and\nquestioned to see—and to—so we can determine what their\ninvolvement in this action was.\" (Kelly deposition testimony\nat page 80).\n[50a1 in substance, McGurn, as well, deemed the fact that\nSarnicola and Rossi were in the vehicle to be \"all part of the\ndeal\"—\"all part of the sale\" and deemed such sufficient to\narrest them  (McGurn deposition testimony at pages 34-36);\nf51a] Beckley, who conducted the strip search of the\nPlaintiff, was informed and understood that the Plaintiff\nhad been arrested because \"she was with them.\"  (Beckley\ndeposition testimony at page 24-26).\nn\nf52a\"| Pierro, who interrogated Sarnicola at the police\nfacility, indicated that, prior to his commencement of the\ninterrogation, he had been informed that Sarnicola was\narrested \"because she was in a group of people involved in\nthe bust operation and they were all brought to\nheadquarters\" where it was his \"assignment...to discuss with\nher the level of involvement with these people.\" (Pierro\ndeposition testimony at page 13).\nf53a] it was only after Sarnicola was informed by the police\nwhile she was in custody that Tricardo was involved in a\ndrug transaction, that she became aware of what Tricardo had\ndone and was doing. She had no knowledge whatsoever of such;\nand, when informed, Sarnicola was shocked; figuratively\nspeaking, her \"...face hit the floor\". (Sarnicola Affidavit).\n[54a] on the way to Brooklyn, Sarnicola and Rossi were\npermitted to drink beer in the police vehicle although\nPierro denies that either he or Antonecchi drank beer\neven though Sarnicola alleges such and Rossi testified that\nPierro and Antonecchi did drink beer (Pierro deposition\ntestimony at pages 60-64; Rossi deposition testimony at\npages 39-42 and 53-54; Plaintiff's Complaint).\nO\n\nn C.  THE BASIS FOR SERGEANT McGURN'S DIRECTIVE\nTO SUBJECT THE PLAINTIFF TO A STI&P SEARCH\nAt the time that Sergeant Thomas McGurn directed  the strip\nsearch of the Plaintiff the following relevant material facts are\nuncontradicted:\nfib] McGurn  directed  that the Plaintiff  be  subjected  to a\nstrip search pursuant to and under the authority of the policy\nof the County of Westchester encompassed in Westchester County\nDepartment  of  Public  Safety  General  Order,  Section  42.05,\nencaptioned  \"Cavity  Searches  of  Prisoners\",  Issued  Date\n01/0/92/Effective Date 01/01/92  (McGurn deposition testimony\nat pages 57, 65-67);\n[2b] McGurn  had  no  independent  basis  to  believe  that  the\nPlaintiff was concealing contraband and/or a weapon  (McGurn\ndeposition testimony at pages 58-68);\nf3b] McGurn  understood  the  County  policy  to  allow  him  to\nsubject any individual, who was arrested for any drug offense,\nto  a  strip  search without  any  other  independent  factor[s]\nrelated  to  either  the  individual  of  circumstances  of  the\nalleged  crime  (McGurn  deposition  testimony  at  page  66\n\"...anything dealing with drugs, anything—\");\n[4bl  Westchester County Department of Public Safety General\nOrder 42.05 which allows for a strip search on  \"reasonable\nsuspicion\"  [less  than  probable  cause]  in  conjunction  with\nother  factors related  to the circumstances of the arrested\nindividual and/or the circumstances of the arrest;\nC5bl  the Plaintiff was subjected to the strip search during\nwhich  process  Ms.  Sarnicola  periodically  cried  (Beckley\ndeposition testimony at pages 15-18);\n[6b] the procedures reguired to be followed, where as here a\nstrip search was undertaken, were not followed:, the policy\nrequires that two officers of the same sex be present and\nduring the search in this case only one, Officer\nBeckley, was present (Sarnicola deposition testimony at pages\n61-62); and the policy requires that every strip search must\nbe documented in a written report and no written report was\nmade as part of the arrest reports (see Westchester County\nDepartment of public Safety General Order 42.05  (Beckley\ndeposition testimony at page 39);\n[7b] Sarnicola was not subjected to any kind of frisk, pat,\nor other search prior to being subjected to the strip\nn search (Sarnicola Affidavit);\nTF1T\n\nf8b\") Beckley conducted the strip search pursuant to a\nsupervisor's direction  (Beckley depositiorf testimony\nat page 23);\nf9b] pursuant to the strip search procedure, Beckley went\ninto a cell and directed the Plaintiff to remove her clothing\nitems, one by way, including her skirt, her shirt, her\nunderwear and bra, and to  turn around and bend over; and the\nPlaintiff complied (Beckley deposition testimony at pages 16-\n19);\nflOb] No contraband was found on Sarnicola (Beckley deposition\ntestimony at page 19).\nD.  THE PLAINTIFF'S DETENTION AND EVENTUAL RELEASE\nThe following are uncontested material facts related to the\nPlaintiff's excessive detention claim:\nPursuant to Sergeant McGurn's directive the Plaintiff was\narrested at or about 6:00 P.M.  (Rowan 4/26/01 field report);\nf2c\"| she was transported to the Westchester County Department\nof Public Safety Facility  [after initially being transported\nfor a very brief period to the Village of Tarrytown Police\nDepartment] (Sarnicola 50[h] hearing testimony at pages 36-40;\nO Sarnicola deposition testimony at pages 49, 52);\n[3c\"| the Plaintiff was not fingerprinted or photographed\nor booked when she was brought to the Westchester County\nPolice Department facility  (McGurn deposition testimony at\npage 106) although the Plaintiff was eventually photographed\n(Sarnicola 50[h] hearing testimony at page 39); and she was\nnever charged with any crime or otherwise booked  (see\nSarnicola arrest report);\n[4c] she was subjected to the strip search  (Sarnicola 50[h]\nhearing  testimony  at  pages  42-44;  Sarnciola  deposition\ntestimony at pages 59-64; Beckley deposition testimony at\npages 16-19);\n\\5c] then, she was interrogated, at the outset of which she\nwas informed \"...sweetheart, we want to let you go\" (Sarnicola\ndeposition  testimony  at  pages  69,  74), and  which  at  the\nconclusion of the interrogation resulted in her memorializing\na statement commencing at or about 8:20 P.M. and concluding at\nor about 8:45  P.M.  (Sarnicola  4/26/01 statement; Sarnicola\n50[h] hearing testimony at pages 44-47; Sarnicola deposition\ntestimony at pages 64-71; Pierro deposition testimony at page\n44);\nn\n10\nin\n\n[6C1 the Plaintiff was, then, informed that she would be able\nto leave \"soon\" (Sarnicola 50[h] hearing testimony at pages\n47-52; Sarnicola deposition testimony at pages 77-78);\nT7c1 if the Plaintiff had been informed that she could leave\nat the time that she completed her interrogation and wrote out\nher statement at or about 8:45 P.M., she would have left in a\n\"heart beat\". She would have endeavored to locate a train and\ntake a train back to the City; she actually inquired,\nright after she finished writing out her statement whether\nthere was a bus or train that she could get to return to the\nCity and it was at that time that she was told that she would\nbe able to leave \"soon\" (Sarnicola Affidavit);\nf8c] periodically the Plaintiff asked when she could leave and\nwas  continuously  informed  \"soon\"  (Sarnicola  deposition\ntestimony at pages 77-78);\nF9c1 that based on the \"soon\" pronouncements, the Plaintiff\ndid not believe that she was free to leave (Sarnicola\nAffidavit);\nflOc] Sarnicola believes that it was unreasonable not to tell\nher that she could not leave when she first asked and then\nperiodically asked thereafter and when she was informed\n\"soon\"; and she further believes that it was unreasonable not\no\nto let her leave once she completed her statement at or about\n8:45 P.M.  (Sarnicola Affidavit);\nf lie\") Frank Rossi completed his interrogation and statement at\nor  about  10:45  P.M.  [Rossi  4/26/01  statement]; Rossi was,\nthereafter,  detained  for  approximately  one  half  hour  or\nthereabouts before he and the Plaintiff were  informed  that\nthey could go home  (Rossi deposition testimony at pages 33-\n35);\nf12c] it was not until about 11:30 P.M. when Sarnicola was\ninformed that she could leave (Sarnicola Affidavit);\nf13<fc] Sarnicola was taken to the front desk and.Frank Rossi\nwas already there and the Plaintiff waited another twenty\nminutes to forty five minutes before she and Frank Rossi\nactually left the facility with the officers (Sarnicola 50[h]\nhearing testimony at pages 48-49,51);\n[14c] thereafter, the Plaintiff and Rossi were informed that\nthey could get a ride back to Brooklyn since Officer Pierro\nand others were going to Brooklyn to do some  business  in\nconnection  with  the  arrest  and  detention  of  Mr.  Tricardo\n(Rossi deposition testimony at pages 35-37; Sarnicola 50[h]\nhearing testimony at page 51; McGurn deposition testimony at\nn pages 69-70, 73-74 where he concedes that it was two hours\n11\n•n\n\nn after  Ms.  Sarnicola  completed  her  statement  before  he\nindicated she could leave) ;  *»\nf 14c\"| McGurn  indicated that Ms. Sarnicola was not released\nwhen she completed her statement because the investigation was\non-going  (McGurn deposition testimony at page 70);\n[15c] it was between twenty minutes  and  45 minutes  before\nRossi and Sarnicola left the Department facility once she and\nRossi were brought to the desk on the first floor at or about\n11:30 or thereabouts  (Sarnicola 50 [h] hearing testimony at\npage 51);\n|\"16c\"| the Plaintiff thought it was unreasonable for the police\nto  hold  her  once  she  had  given  a  statement  and  was  not\ninformed that she could leave but that she would be able to\nleave  \"soon\"  (Sarnicola  Affidavit;  Sarnicola  deposition\ntestimony at pages 72-76).\nII. THE CONTESTED FACTS\nBased on the Defendants' submissions, it is important that the\nCourt  be clear  as to what  facts the Plaintiff  contends  are  in\ndispute.\nn\nA.  THE  ALLEGED \"HUDDLE\"\nThe  Defendants  contend  that, when  Sarnicola,  Tricardo  and\nRossi, and Name   exited their respective vehicles, they came\nRedacted\ntogether, in a huddle type of configuration, spoke and \"high fived\"\neach other (McGurn deposition testimony at pages 24-25 [\"...she was\nstanding right in the middle of the huddle. They were four people\nall facing each other to the center.\"]; McGurn deposition testimony\nat page 96).\nThe Plaintiff categorically denies such. See: Sarnicola 50[h]\nhearing  testimony  at  pages  27-30;  Sarnicola  deposition\ntestimony  at  pages  3 3-40;  Sarnicola  Affidavit;  Rossi\ndeposition testimony at pages 20-24. Sergeant McGurn's report,\nmemorialized on 4/26/01 does not document such (McGurn 4/26/01\nfield report); and Detective Rowan, whose observations were\nthe primary observations of what took place in the CVS parking\nlot, does not document the same. His report states: \"When all\nof the subject  [sic] were out of their respective cars, the\no\n12\n\nthree  (3)  males  gave  each  other  f*ve  and  conversed\nf> momentarily.11  (Rowan 4/26/01 field reportj\\\n•I.. '\nBoth the Plaintiff and Mr. Rossi deny that any \"high fives\"\nwere given. Sarnicola and Rossi testify that there were\nmomentary remarks in which Sarnicola indicated that she was\ngoing to the bathroom and asked Frank Rossi if he wanted to go\nwith her (Sarnicola deposition testimony at pages 34-38;\nSarnciola 50[h] hearing testimony at pages 28-30; Rossi\ndeposition testimony at pages 18-23).  Although Tricardo and\nName   left the parking lot, they did not do so, together,\nRweidtahct etdhe Plaintiff and with Mr. Rossi even if they may have\nbeen exiting at or about the same time as the Plaintiff and\nRossi were leaving the parking lot. Ms. Sarnicola and Mr.\nRossi believed that Name   and Tricardo were behind them\nand that, when they R[ePdlaactiedntiff and Rossi] turned on Broadway\nafter leaving the parking lot, they believed Name   and\nTricardo to still be somewhere in the parkingR eldoatct ed(Sarnicola\nand Rossi testimonies, supra; Sarnicola Affidavit).\nB.  THE ALLEGED \"WALK BY SURVEILLANCE\"\nDefendant McGurn has asserted that, prior to the point in time\nwhen  he directed  the  arrest  of  the  Plaintiff,  he  [McGurn]  was\naware/had been informed by Detective Kelly that the Plaintiff, Mr.\nRossi and Name   walked toward the location where he [Kelly] was\nRedacted\nparked and that, as they passed, Rossi and the Plaintiff  looked\ninto his vehicle and continued on while Name   got into Kelly's\nRedacted\nvehicle (McGurn deposition testimony at pages 26, 100-101).\nThe Plaintiff contests that Kelly observed such and that he\ncommunicated such and the Plaintiff contests that McGurn knew\nsuch.  As  it turned  out, when  the  Plaintiff  and  Mr.  Rossi\nexited the CVS parking lot got to the street arid exited the\nparking  lot,  they  turned  right  which  is  south  on  North\nBroadway  (Sarnicola deposition testimony at pages 35-36, 40;\nSarnciola 50[h] hearing testimony at page 30; Rossi deposition\ntestimony at page 23) . Such  is corroborated  in the report\nwritten by Detective Rowan (see Rowan 4/26/01 field report).\nApparently, Tricardo and Name   exited onto South Broadway\nand turned north [the oppRoesdaictteed direction, see: Rowan 4/26/01\nfield  report]  —the  area  in which,  according  to  Detective\nKelly,  his  vehicle  was  located  (see:  Kelly  4/26/01  field\nreport and Kelly deposition testimony at pages 16-17).\nNowhere  does  Detective  Kelly  memorialize  the  fact  of  the\n13\n\n,/~  conduct he attributes to the Plaintiff a&i Rossi or of the\n',  fact  of  advising  McGurn  or  anyone  else  of  such; nor  does\nMcGurn memorialize being informed of such. All Detective Kelly\nwrites  is: \"At approximately  174 5 hours, I received  a page\nfrom Gabe and at the same time he entered my vehicle on the\nfront  passenger  side.\"  As  noted,  to  the  extent  that\nDetective  Rowan  recorded,  as part  of his  observation,  the\ndirection in which Rossi and Sarnicola went once they reached\nSouth Broadway, such direction was the opposite direction in\nwhich Name Redacted The reports  from Rowan  and Kelly make  it\nclear that he had no communications in this regard, or for all\nintent and purposes in any respect, with McGurn at the time\nand location of Name Redacted  arrest  (Kelly and Rowan 4/26/01\nfield  reports; Kelly  deposition  testimony  at pages  31-36;\nMcGurn deposition testimony at pages 101-102).\nMoreover  and  notwithstanding  that  Kelly  testified  at  his\ndeposition that he identified Ms. Sarnicola on  South Broadway\nwhen she was arrested, he does not indicate such in his report\n(Kelly 4/26/01 field report). On the other hand, Rowan, who\nhad observed Ms. Sarnicola when she exited the vehicle in the\nparking  lot  and  had  distributed  her  characteristics  over\npolice communications, indicates in his report that it was he,\nafter being called to South Broadway from the parking lot, who\nidentified Ms. Sarnicola when she was placed  under arrest,\nonce again undercutting  the credibility of the assertions of\nf~ |  Kelly that the Plaintiff  and Rossi went by his vehicle and\n*'  looked into it and that he ever communicated such to anyone\n(Kelly and Rowan 4/26/01 field reports).\nC.  THE ALLEGED Name   AND McGURN EXCHANGE\nRedacted\nDefendant  McGurn  also  now  contends  that,  in  addition  to\nlearning  from Name    that  Tricardo  was  his  ecstasy  supplier\nRedacted\nbefore or at or about the time that McGurn gave the directive to\narrest Tricardo, Rossi and the Plaintiff, Name   also informed\nRedacted\nhim at that time that \"...he and Tricardo had numerous cell phone\nconversations  during  the  trip  from  Brooklyn  in  which  Tricardo\ninstructed Name   about how the drug deal should take place and\nRedacted\nthat  it should  happen  quickly\".  See: McGurn  February  1,  2002\nAffidavit. McGurn now states, as well, that Name   informed him,\nRedacted\n  [when Name   was arrested and waived his.\n/ir\nRedacted\n11  14\n\nMcGurn] that \"when the two cars first parked in £he CVS parking lot\ni\n'  and  all  parties  exited  their  vehicles, and  engaged  in  a  brief\ndiscussion, Tricardo again dictated how the drug deal should take\nplace  and  that  it  should  be  completed  quickly.\"  See:  McGurn\nFebruary 1, 2002 Affidavit.\nIn that regard, the Plaintiff and Mr. Rossi do not deny that,\nduring  the  course  of the trip  from Brooklyn  to Tarrytown,\nTricardo was on the cell phone on some occasions but that,\nother than for asking Name   how much longer it would be\nbefore they arrived, thReerdea cwteads little discussion of which they\nare aware and certainly nothing to suggest to either of them,\nfrom the portion of the conversation[s] that they were aware\nthat  was  on-going,  of  anything  about  a  drug  transaction\n(Sarnicola 50[h] hearing testimony at pages 25-26; Sarnicola\ndeposition  testimony  at  pages  30-32;  Sarnicola  Affidavit;\nRossi deposition testimony at page 16) . Moreover, there is no\nevidence whatsoever that Name   at all indicated that all\nof  the  parties  engaged Riend actae d discussion  during  which  the\nPlaintiff  became  aware/was  aware  of  the  drug\ntransaction/enterprise that was then on-going.\nIn fact,  at no time did McGurn ever testify at any point in\n<,r~  his deposition that Name   ever informed him, at the time\n  '  of his arrest and jusRte dapcrteidor to McGurn giving his directive to\n(\narrest Rossi, Tricardo and the Plaintiff, of anything but the\nfact that Tricardo [\"Mike\"] was his supplier and that Tricardo\nwas one of the individuals in the Durango (see: McGurn bli&IQY\nfield report).  In fact, when asked whether or not Name \nindicated anything else to him other than that TricRaedradcote dwas\nhis supplier and that Tricardo  was in the Durango vehicle,\nMcGurn testified at his deposition, without any equivocation,\nno. See: McGurn deposition testimony at pages 32-34.\nTo the extent that his deposition testimony when taken as a\nwhole can be read to indicate that he needed to review his\nreport to determine whether there was anything further said by\nName Redacted  McGurn's  report  makes  no  reference  to  being\ninformed of anything else by Name   at that time [prior to\nthe McGurn directive to arreRsetd atcthede Plaintiff, Tricardo, and\nRossi] other than Tricardo was his supplier and that Tricardo\n[known as \"Mike\"] was in the other vehicle  (McGurn 4/26/01\nfield report).  To the extent that Name Redacted  post arrest\nstatement  makes  mention  of  communications,  etc.,  that\nstatement was not taken until much latter at or about  8:00\nP.M.  (Name    4/26/01  statement).  Defendant  McGurn  has\ncollapsReedd actteidmes and  information to advance and to bolster,\nafter the fact, the knowledge which he now claims to have had\nat the time of his direction to arrest the Plaintiff when, in\n•T\n15\n\nn fact, he did not, at that time, have certain of the knowledge.\nHe has, for all intent and purposes, admitted that he did not\nthen have certain knowledge he now claims to have had through\nhis  deposition  testimony  and  the  substance  of  his\ncontemporaneously  recorded  4/26/01 field  report  neither  of\nwhich make reference to the information he now claims Name \n and Kelly provided him just prior to or at or abouRte dtahcte\ntime of the McGurn directive to arrest the Plaintiff. ed\nWhat is the most significant aspect of the entire discussion\nwith Name   is that, while Name   specifically\nidentRiefdiaectse dTricardo as the suppRleidaecrte,d thereby establishing the\nprobable cause for the arret of Tricardo,  Name   provided\nMcGurn with no information specifically linRkeidnagct edthe Plaintiff\nor Mr. Rossi to the drug transaction or to having any\nknowledge of the drug transaction. Therefore, the information,\nas attributed to Kelly and to Name   [other than for the\nName   identification of TrRiecdaarctdeod as the supplier] should\nRbeed adctiesdcounted in making the assessment as to what McGurn knew\nat the time that the Plaintiff was arrested.\nUltimately,  both  McGurn  and  Kelly  have  testified  that  the\ncontested information would not have made any difference and that,\nbased on the mere presence of the Plaintiff in the vehicle which\nfollowed the Name   vehicle and the momentary exchange between\nRedacted\nthe occupants of the vehicle when they existed their  respective\nvehicles and the fact that Tricardo was identified by Name   as\nRedacted\nhis  supplier,  the  Plaintiff  would  have  been  arrested  for  the\npurposes  of  bringing  her,  along  with  Rossi,  into  the  police\nfacility for interrogation in order to sort it out.\nThus,  from  the  Plaintiff's  perspective,  the  contested\ninformation is basically irrelevant to the resolution of the claim\nwhether the Defendant McGurn had sufficient information [when the\ncontested information is discounted] to arrest her; and the answer,\nfrom the Plaintiff  perspective, is, categorically, no.\n16\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n1 w\nThe Plaintiff, by her attorney, reserves ner right to amend\nand  supplement  this  document.  Furthermore,  the  Plaintiff\nsubmits that, given the non contested relevant material facts and\ndiscounting  the contested  facts which, by the admission  of  the\nDefendants appear to have no bearing on their decision to arrest\nthe Plaintiff because they would have arrested the Plaintiff in any\nevent, this Court should deny the Defendants'  Motion for Summary\nJudgment and grant the Plaintiff's Cross Motion.  To the extent,\nhowever, that the contested facts have a bearing on how the Court\nshould resolve the contesting Motions [arguendo], this Court should\nthen deny the Motions on the false arrest claim  although, with\nrespect to the Plaintiff's  Fourth Amendment  strip search claim\nn\nand/or the Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment excessive detention, the\nCourt should enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff.\nDATED: New York, New York\nFebruary 17, 2002\nRespectfully submitted,\nRES I.
