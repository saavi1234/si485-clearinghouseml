    "summary": "<p>On February 13, 2003, a prisoner in the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC), filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the DOC.  The plaintiff, pro se at the time of the filing, asked the court for injunctive relief and damages, alleging that the employees of the DOC violated his constitutional rights. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the employees of the DOC violated his rights, under the Due Process Clause and the 8th Amendment, by subjecting him to unreasonable strip searches, depriving him of food, exposing him to extreme temperatures, and placing him on paper restrictions. </p><p>By order dated February 13, 2003, the District Court (Judge Barbara B. Crabb) ruled that Plaintiff could proceed with his claim that defendants violated his 8th Amendment rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment when they denied him food, subjected him to extreme cell temperatures, conducted unreasonable strip searches and subjected him to sensory deprivation and social isolation. Judge Crabb dismissed, as legally frivolous, the plaintiff's claim that the DOC violated his Due Process rights by placing him on paper restriction. </p><p>On June 3, 2003, Judge Crabb dismissed the plaintiff's claim against the DOC regarding unreasonable strip searches, stating that the plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claim. The court also dismissed plaintiff's claim that the defendants deprived him of social interaction because the defendants had qualified immunity against liability for damages.  The court further stated that injunctive relief was unnecessary in regards to the lack of social interaction because a previous class action suit against the DOC and the prison, of which the Plaintiff was a class member, resulted in a settlement agreement that addressed the issue. </p><p>Defendants moved for summary judgment on the Plaintiff's two remaining claims. On December 17, 2003, the court denied summary judgment on Plaintiff's food deprivation claim, but granted summary judgment on his claim that he was subject to extreme temperatures, stating that there was not enough evidence to prove his claim to the jury.</p><p>On June 6, 2004, Plaintiff was assigned private counsel. On July 30, 2004, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, alleging that the DOC's practice of depriving Plaintiff of food for multiple days in a row when he refused to comply with prison policy constituted cruel and unusual punishment and exposed his health to serious harm. Plaintiff sought injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees.  </p><p>The case proceeded to trial and, on December 21, 2004, a permanent injunction was granted enjoining the defendants from withholding meals from Plaintiff in response to any rule violation that does not constitute an imminent security risk. The jury also found the defendants liable for violating the plaintiff's constitutional rights and awarded plaintiff $50,000 in compensatory damages and $400,000 in punitive damages against each of the individually named defendants. </p><p>On March 21, 2005, the 7th Circuit ruled that prisoners who miss meals because of rule violations were never subject to punishment, but rather were punishing themselves and therefore could not sustain cruel and unusual punishment claims. Rodriguez v. Briley, 403 F.3d 952  (7th Cir. 2005).  In response to the 7th Circuit ruling, Judge Crabb vacated the judgment and instructed the clerk of the court to enter judgment in favor of all defendants on all claims. </p><p>Plaintiff's petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit was denied.  </p><p></p>",

Plaintiff wins at trial, obtaining a permanent injunction against the DOC and winning damages against each of the individually named defendants. Shortly after Plaintiff won judgment, the 7th Circuit ruled in a different case that prisoners cannot sustain cruel and unusual punishment claims against prison officials when prisoners are deprived food as a result of rule violations.

Box 7857 \nMadison, WI  53707-7857 \n\nPreli  Statement \nThis is a civil rights action file  by Berrell Freeman, a state prisoner, for injunctive \nrelief and damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that defendants exposed plaintiff to \nserious hann to his health through en  rcement of a policy that deprived plaintiff of \nnutritionally adequate food and that, i  so doing, defendants violated plaintiffs right to \nbe free from cruel and unusual punish  ent under the Eighth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. \nPlaintiff alleges as follows: \nParties \n1.  PlaintiffBerrell Freema  is an adult currently incarcerated at the Wisconsin \nSecure Program Facility (\"WSPF\") in Boscobel, Wisconsin.  Plaintiff has been in the \ncustody of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections throughout all events described in \nthis complaint. \n2.  Defendant Gerald Berge is employed by the Wisconsin Department of \nCorrections as the warden at the WSP  and has been so employed at all times relevant to \nthis action.  He is sued in his individu  I and official capacities. \n3.  In addition to serving as  arden at the WSPF, defendant Berge is also \nemployed by the Wisconsin Departme  t of Corrections as the warden at the Prairie du \nChien Correctional Institution and has  een so employed since July 2003. \n4.  Warden Berge spends a  roximately half of his time at the WSPF. \n2 \n\n5.  Defendant Peter Huibre  se is employed by the Wisconsin Department of \nCorrections as the deputy warden at th  WSPF and has been so employed since at least \nApril 2002. \n6.  Defendant Gary Bought  n is employed by the Wisconsin Department of \nCorrections as the security director at  he WSPF since November 2000. \n7.  Defendant John Shazpe  as employed by the Wisconsin Department of \nCorrections as a unit manager at the  SPF until at least sometime in 2002.  Upon \ninfOlmation and belief, Mr. Shazpe is  resently employed as a captain at the WSPF and \nhas been so employed since leaving hi  position as unit manager. \n8.  Defendant Brad Hompe  as employed by the Wisconsin Department of \nCorrections as a unit manager at the  SPF at alI times relevant to this action.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Mr. Hompe is  resently employed as the Deputy Warden at the \nRacine Correctional Institution. \nJ  risdiction and Venue \n9.  This court has jurisdicti  n over the claims in this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343. \n10.  Venue is proper under 2  U.S.C. § 1391 (b)(l) and (2). \n3 \n\nactual Back  round \n11.  The WSPF has a policy  equiring that, in order to receive meals, inmates \nmust put on pants, turn on their cell Ii  ht, and stand in the middle of their cell in full view \nof officers. \n12.  The policy does not hav  a safety purpose, but rather is purportedly \nintended to prevent inmates from exp  sing themselves to officers. \n13.  If an inmate fails to foll  w this procedure, the inmate mayor may not be \ngiven a meal and, per the meal delive  policy, the inmate may be considered to have \n\"refused\" his meal. \n14.  An inmate that does not  omp1ete1y comply with the policy is sometimes \ngiven a meal anyway, depending upon the officers involved with serving the meal. \n15.  The Canteen section oft e Level Program Handbook includes no \nrequirement that inmates have trouse  or shorts on and stand in the middle of their cells \nwith the cell lights on in order to recei  e canteen items. \n16.  Except during delivery  f meals and medicine, inmates are not required to \ntum on their lights, put pants on, and s and in the middle of their cell in order to receive \nanything. \n4 \n\n17.  For example, officers d liver inmates legal loan materials and canteen items \nwithout requiring inmates to tum on t  e cell light, put their pants on, or stand in the \nmiddle of the cell. \n18.  Officers are able to tum on cell lights by use of a switch on the outside of \nthe cell. \n19.  Defendant Berge is resp  nsible for the administration and operation of the \nWSPF and is familiar with the securit  policies in place there. \n20.  Upon information and b  lief, defendant Huibregtse takes over the \nresponsibilities ofthe warden when W  rden Berge is not at the WSPF. \n21.  Upon information and b  lief, defendant Huibregtse also supervises the unit \nmanagers and serves as the reviewing  uthority for inmate complaints. \n22.  Security Director Bough on is responsible for the WSPF's policies and \nprocedures for security.  He also signs off on incident reports and conduct reports. \n23.  Unit Manager Hompe w  s, upon information and belief, responsible for \nUnit Delta, the staff working on that u  it, and the inmates on that unit, including Mr. \nFreeman, during times relevant to this  ction. \n24.  Unit Manager Sharpe wa , upon information and belief, responsible for \nUnit Foxtrot, the staff working on that  nit, and the inmates on that unit, including Mr. \nFreeman, during times relevant to this  ction. \n5 \n\n25.  Officers have denied pI  intiffmeals on the basis that he did not comply \nwith the meal delivery policy.  Under the meal distribution policy, an inmate's \nnoncompliance with the meal distribu ion policy may be considered a \"refusal.\" \n26.  Since 2000, the plainti  has, on numerous occasions, been deprived of \nregular and nutritionally adequate me Is for continuous periods of time often extending \nover days. \n27.  On April 23, 2001, to A  ril 25, 2001, plaintiff was denied all his meals. \n28.  Between July 6,2001, a  d November 3, 2001, plaintiff received only \napproximately 121 meals and was de  ied approximately 242 meals. \n29.  In January 2002, plainti  was denied all meals for three days. \n30.  In April 2002, plaintiff  as denied all meals for two days. \n31.  Between June 29, 2002, and July 8, 2002, plaintiff was denied most, ifnot \nall, of his meals, including a period  eight consecutive days in which he was denied all \n0 \nmeals. \n32.  In late January 2003, pI  intiffwas denied at least four meals over a period \noffour days. \n33.  In February 2003, plain iff was denied all meals for at least three \nconsecutive days. \n6 \n\n34.  In March 2003, plaintiff was denied all meals for at least three consecutive \ndays. \n35.  From May 18,2003, to  une 5, 2003, plaintiff was denied at least 32 of 57 \nmeals. \n36.  Plaintiff was denied all  ea1s on September 12-13, 2003, and again was \ndenied most, ifnot all, meals on Septe  ber 22-25,2003. \n37.  Plaintiff was denied foo  every day from October 2, 2003, through October \n12,2003, including a period of at least eight consecutive days in which he received no \nmeals. \n38.  Inmates on Levels 1 and 2 are not allowed to purchase any food items \navailable from the canteen. \n39.  Even if inmates are allo  ed to buy food from the canteen, they are limited \nto five food items. \n40.  Most of the food items a  ailable from the canteen are candy or snack foods \nsuch as chips. \n41.  Warden Berge holds we  kly multidisciplinary \"Special Needs\" meetings \nduring which various officials corne t  ether to report on and discuss problems with \nspecific inmates. \n7 \n\n42.  The Warden andlor the  eputy Warden attend(s) the Special Needs \nmeetings. \n43.  Security Director Bough on attends the Special Needs meetings. \n44.  Representatives ofheaIt  services and clinical services attend the Special \nNeeds meetings. \n45.  Unit managers attend the Special Needs meetings. \n46.  An inmate missing nume ous meals would typically be something \ndiscussed at the Special Needs meetin  s. \n47.  Warden Berge does not r  caIJ there ever being a discussion at a Special \nNeeds meeting about Mr. Freeman mis ing meals. \n48.  Security Director Bought  n does not recall there ever being a discussion at \na Special Needs meeting about Mr. Fre man missing meals. \n49.  Dr. Gary Maier, the psyc  iatrist at WSPF, does not recall there ever being a \ndiscussion at a Special Needs meeting  bout Mr. Freeman missing meals. \n50.  Under Procedure 524.06  n the Security Policies and Procedures Manual in \neffect at the WSPF since October 10, 2  00, \nIn the event an inmate denies a  eal, refuses staff directives to obtain a \nmeal, or fails to consume the me I provided, a notation shall be made in the \nUnit multi-purpose log book an  the following is to be followed: \n8 \n\nA.  Day2 \n1.  After two conse utive days of an inmate not eating, the Unit \nSergeant shall di  cuss with the inmate why he is not eating. \nB.  Day 3 \n1.  After three cons  cutive days of not eating, the Unit Sergeant shall \ncomplete and in  ident report and verbally inform HSU, Clinical staff \nand the Unit Ma  ager.  This contact and all information available is \nto be documente  in the Unit log book and on the incident report. \n2.  HSU staff shall  valuate the inmate.  The evaluation may occur on \nthe Unit or in H  U.  HSU will continue to monitor the inmate on a \ndaily basis. \n3.  Unit staff will c  ntinue to monitor the inmate's behavior. \nC.  Day 4 and after \n1.  The Unit Sergea  t will review the daily meal log and write an \nIncident Report  or each inmate that is continuing to deny/refuse \nmeals. \nThis procedure also states that \"[rJefusal to comply with staff directives to receive \na meal shall be documented in the U  ·t behavioral log.\" \n51.  When plaintiff missed  eals, he was not monitored by the health services \nstaff any more often than usual. \n52.  The Department of Co  ections has a form titled \"Not Eating or Drinking \nInformation\" that it provides to inmat s.  It states: \nNot eating food or drin  ing fluids may cause short term or long term \nillness up to and inc1udi  g death. \nNot eating or drinking  ything may cause death in just a few days. \nDrinking fluids and not  ating is less dangerous, but can lead to \nserious illness if contin  ed for days. \n9 \n\n: \nBody reactions to starvi  g include:  loss of body fluids, dizziness, \nIightheadedness, weakn  ss, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, \nsluggishness, initability  weight loss, low blood sugar, slow heart \nrate and low blood pres  reo \nStarving can result in he rt damage, kidney damage, and death.  Depending \non the length of starvati  n, damage to the heart and kidneys may be \npermanent. \n53.  Inmates on Levels 1 an  2 are not allowed to order food items from the \ncanteen. \n54.  Plaintiff has suffered fr  m depression, sleep disturbances, acid reflux, \nulceration, nausea, chest pain, muscle  ain, and frequent headaches.  He has received \nmedication for these conditions.  He s  metimes has trouble breathing.  In addition, \nplaintiff's vision has deteriorated sinc  being incarcerated at the WSPF.  He is often \nforgetful and confused.  He has been  laced on clinical observation for attempting suicide \nand for smearing blood, feces and uri  e all over his cell. \n55.  On February 12,2003,  dge Barbara B. Crabb entered an order granting \nplaintiffleave to proceed on his depri  ation of food claim. \n56.  In an order filed June 4, 2003, Judge Crabb allowed plaintiff's case relating \nto his food deprivation claims to go fi iward after finding that plaintiff had exhausted all \nadministrative remedies. \n57.  Defendants were aware  f conditions that created a serious risk of harm to \nplaintiffs health, conditions that wer  easily preventable, yet they remained deliberately \nindifferent to this risk. \n10 \n\n58.  As a result of defendants' denial of meals and use of food as punishment, \nplaintiff has suffered great mental and  hysical distress. \nClaim for Relief \n59.  The defendants' enforce  ent of a policy that creates serious harm to \nplaintiffs health by repeatedly denyin  him meals constitutes deliberate indifference to \nplaintiffs basic nutritional needs in vi  lation of the Eighth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 19  3. \nRelief Requested \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff req  ests that the court grant the following relief: \nA.  Issue a declaratory judg  ent stating that defendants' enforcement ofa \npolicy that deprived plaintiff of repeate  meals over periods of days as a form \npunishment violated the plaintiff's righ s under the Eighth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution; and \nB.  Issue an injunction requi  ng that defendants not use the deprivation of food \nas a punishment; and \nc. \nAward compensatory da  ages against defendants for the physical and \nemotional injury resulting from the defi ndants' deliberate indifference to plaintiffs \nnutritional needs; and \nD.  Award punitive damages  gainst defendants; and \nE.  Award plaintiff his attorn  y's fees and costs; and \n11 \n\nF.  Grant such other and  rther relief as this Court may deem just and \nequitable. \nJury Demand \nThe plaintiff demands a trial  y JUry. \nDated this 8th day of July, 20  4. \nRespectfully submitted \nDavid J.

      "text": "IN THE UNIT  D STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WEST  RN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \nBERRELL FREEMAN, \nOPINION and \nORDER \nPlaintiff, \n03-C-0021-C \nv. \nGERALD A. BERGE, PETER HUIB \nGARY BOUGHTON, JOHN S \nBRAD HOMPE, \nThis is a civil action under 42  .S.c. § 1983 for declaratory, injunctive and monetary \nrelief.  Plaintiff,  an  inmate  at the  isconsin  Secure  Program  Facility,  contends that \ndefendants violated his Eighth Amend  ent protection against cruel and unusual punishment \nby enforcing a prison policy that resul ed in plaintiff s not receiving hundreds of meals over \na three to four year period.  This case  s before the court on defendants' motion to dismiss \nunder Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(6).  D  fendants  assert that they are  entitled to qualified \nimmunity.  Jurisdiction is present. 28  .S.c. § 1331. \nFor the reasons stated below,  will deny defendants' motion.  In brief, although \n1  Copy of this document has bee \nprovi  ed to'::,. c..l~=---'rlI:oL.j.' \n{L \n\nprison officials have an unquestiona  Ie interest in enforcing rules and procedures, they also \nhave obligations under the Eighth  endment to provide inmates adequate food and to \nprotect inmates from  self-destructi  e behavior.  Plaintiffs allegations establish conduct \nsufficient to satisfy both the objecti  e and subjective aspects of the Eighth Amendment \ninquiry.  Plaintiff's right to be free  from the treatment alleged in his second amended \ncomplaint was clearly established by  Thus, at this stage of the litigation, defendants \nare not entitled to qualified immuni \nFor the sole purpose of decidi  g this motion, I find that plaintiff's second amended \ncomplaint alleges the following. \nALLE  ATIONS OF FACT \nPlaintiff is  an  inmate  at th  Wisconsin  Secure  Program  Facility  in  Boscobel, \nWisconsin. Defendant Berge is the wa den, responsible for the administration and operation \nof the facility and familiar with the  ecurity policies in place at the facility.  Defendant \nHuibregtse is the deputy warden at  e facility.  He serves as the warden in defendant \nBerge's absence,  supervises  unit rna  agers and reviews inmate complaints.  Defendant \nBoughton is employed as  the securi y director at the facility;  he is responSible for the \nfacility's security policies and signs of on conduct reports and incident reports.  Defendant \nSharpe served as a unit manager at t  e facility at some time in 2002; he now serves as a \n2 \n\ncaptain at the facility.  Defendant H  mpe served as a unit manager at the facility at all times \nrelevant to this action;  presently,  e is  the deputy warden at the Racine  Correctional \nInstitution.  Defendants Sharpe an  Hompe were responsible for the staff working in the \nunits to which plaintiff was assigne  at all times relevant to this lawsuit. \nThe Secure Program Facility  equires inmates to put on pants, turn on the light in \ntheir cells and stand in the middle  f their cells in full view of corrections officers before \nreceiving meals.  The policy is desi  ned to prevent inmates from exposing themselves to \nofficers. If an inmate fails to comply  'th anyone of these requirements, he may not receive \nhis meal.  The inmate's failure to co  ply may be deemed a refusal of the meal. \nAt various times from 2000- 003, plaintiff was denied meals because of his failure \nto comply with the facility'S policy  egarding meal delivery.  Plaintiff was denied all meals \nfrom April 23-25, 2001.  Between J  Iy 6, 2001 and November 3, 2001, plaintiff received \napproximately 121 meals and was de  ied approximately 242 meals.  Plaintiff was refused all \nmeals for at least two consecutive da s in January and April 2002.  Between June 29, 2002 \nand July 8, 2002, plaintiff was deni  d almost all of his meals; for a period of eight days he \nreceived no meals at all.  Plaintiff  as denied four meals over the course of four days in \nJanuary 2003 and did not receive an  meals for three consecutive days in both February and \nMarch 2003.  From May 18, 2003  0 June 5, 2003, plaintiff was denied at least 32 of 57 \nmeals.  Plaintiff was denied all mea s on September 12-13 and September 22-25, 2003. \n3 \n\nFinally, plaintiff was denied at least  ne meal each day from October 2-12, 2003, and did \nnot receive any meals for eight days d  ring that period. When plaintiff missed meals, he did \nnot receive increased attention from the health services staff. \nUnder Secure Program Facilit  procedures, if an inmate refuses or does not consume \na meal, \"a notation shall be made in  he unit's mUlti-purpose log book.\"  If an inmate goes \ntwo consecutive days without eating, the unit sergeant is required to speak with the inmate \nabout why he is  not eating.  After  hree days,  (1)  the unit sergeant must complete an \nincident report and verbally inform the health services unit, clinical staff and the unit \nmanager; (2) the health services unit must evaluate the inmate; and (3) the unit staff must \nmonitor the inmate's behavior.  If an inmate does not eat for at least four consecutive days, \nthe unit sergeant must review the d  ily meal log and complete incident reports for each \ndenial or refusal. \nOfficials at the facility keep tr ck of problems with inmates through weekly \"Special \nNeeds\" meetings.  The warden, dep  ty warden, security coordinator and unit managers \nattend these meetings along with  embers of the health services  and clinical services \ndepartments.  An inmate who misses meals continually would be discussed at the \"Special \nNeeds\" meetings.  Defendants Berge  nd Boughton do not recall ever discussing the denial \nof meals to plaintiff at a \"Special Ne ds\" meeting. \nThe  Department  of  Correc  ons  has  a  form  titled  \"Not  Eating  or  Drinking \n4 \n\nInformation\" that it gives inmates t  sign.  The form states: \nNot eating food or drinking fl  ids may cause short term or long term illness up to and \nincluding death. \nNot eating or drinking anyth·ng may cause death in just a few days. \nDrinking fluids and not eati  g is less dangerous, but can lead to serious illness if \ncontinued for days. \nBody reactions to starving in lude: loss of body fluids, dizziness, lightheadedness, \nweakness, nausea, vomiting, ti edness, sluggishness, irritability, weight loss, low blood \nsugar, slow heart rate and 10  blood pressure. \nStarving can result in heart d  mage, kidney damage and death.  Depending on the \nlength of starvation, damage  the heart and kidneys may be permanent. \n0 \nPlaintiff has suffered from and eceived medication for depression, sleep disturbances, \nfrequent headaches, ulceration, nau ea, acid reflux and chest and muscle pain.  He has \nexperienced trouble breathing and vi  ion deterioration since arriving at the Secure Program \nFacility.  He is often confused and fo getful and has been placed on clinical observation for \nattempting suicide and for smearing  lood, urine and feces over his cell. \nDISCUSSION \nA.  ualified Immuni \nThe procedures for deciding a  otion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and \nthe analYSis of a qualified immunit  question are different and often in tension.  On a \n5 \n\nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b (6), a court limits its inquiry to the allegations in the \ncomplaint and grants the  motion  nly if,  after accepting those  allegations  as  true,  it \nconcludes that the plaintiff could p ove no set of facts in support of his claim that would \nentitle him to relief.  Conle  v. Gibs  n, 355 U.S. 41,45-46 (1957).  In the context of a suit \nbrought under § 1983, a court limits 'ts examination to whether the plaintiff has alleged that \na person acting under color of state I  deprived him of a federal right. Alvarado v. Litscher, \n267 F.3d 648,651 (7th Cir. 2001)  citing Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640 (1980)). \nThe plaintiffs allegations must provo de only a short and plain statement of the claim, Fed. \nR.  Civ. P. 8(a), and need not antici  ate and plead around affirmative defenses to avoid \ndismissal.  Iacobs v. City of Chicago  215 F.3d 758, 765 n.3 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"the notice \npleading requirements of Rule 8 do  ot require that a plaintiff anticipate the assertion of \nqualified immunity by the defendant  nd plead allegations that will defeat that immunity. \"); \ncf. Xechem  Inc. v. Bristol-M  ers S  ibb Co., No. 03-4292, slip op. at 4 (7th Cir. June 23, \n2004) (\"Complaints need not con  in any information about defenses and may not be \ndismissed for that omission.\") (emp  sis in original). \nHowever, when a defendant b ses his motion to dismiss on qualified immunity, the \ncourt's inquiry is different.  Qualifie  immunity shields government officials performing \ndiscretionary functions from moneta  liability as long as their conduct \"does not violate \nclearly established statutory or constit  tional rights of which a reasonable person would have \n6 \n\nknown.\"  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457  .S. 800, 818 (1982).  \"The threshold inquiry a court \nmust undertake in a qualified immu  ity analysis is whether plaintiffs allegations, if true, \nestablish a constitutional violation.\"  Hope v.  Pelzer, 536 U.S.  730, 736 (2002) (citing \nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194,201  2001).  Next, a court must determine \"whether the \n[constitutional] right was clearly esta  lished,\" an inquiry that \"must be undertaken in light \nof the specific context of the case, n  t as a broad general proposition.\"  Saucier, 533 U. S. \nat 201.  Although  this inquiry su  ests  that development of the facts  of a  case  is  a \nprerequisite, the Supreme Court ha  stated that qualified immunity questions may be \npresented in a motion to dismiss beca  se qualified immunity is '''an entitlement not to stand \ntrial or face the other burdens of Ii tiga ion '\"  and .\" an immunity from suit''' that is .\" effectively \nlost if a case is erroneously permitted  go to triaL'\"  Saucier, 533 U.S. at 200-01 (quoting \n0 \nMitchell v.  Fors.yth, 472 U.S. 511,  26 (1985)  (emphasis in original».  The Court of \nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit has suggested that qualified immunity should be used \nsparingly as a ground for dismissal u  der Rule 12(b)(6).  Alyarado, 267 F.3d at 651-52 \n(quoting Jacobs, 215 F.3d at 775 (Eas  rbrook, J., concurring) (\"Rule 12(b)( 6) is a mismatch \nfor immunity and almost always a ba  ground for dismissaL\"».  In Jacobs, the court noted \nthat \nIn  some cases, a complaint  ay be dismissed under Rule  12(b)(6) on qualified \nimmunity grounds where the p aintiff asserts the violation of a broad constitutional \nright that had not been artic  lated at the time the violation is  alleged to have \n7 \n\noccurred.  In that case, while  e plaintiff may have stated a claim, it is not one 'upon \nwhich relief can be granted' and a court may properly address this purely legal \nquestion under Rule 12(b)(6  '\"  However, in many cases, the existence of qualified \nimmunity will depend on th  particular facts of a given case.  In those cases, the \nplaintiff is  not required init ally to plead factual  allegations that anticipate and \novercome a defense of qualifi  d immunity. \nId. at 765 n.3.  With this in min  , I turn to the first prong of the qualified immunity \nanalysis:  whether plaintiff's allegati  ns establish a constitutional violation. \n1.  Constitutional violation \nAlthough \"prison conditions  ay be harsh and uncomfortable without violating the \nEighth Amendment's prohibition ag  'nst cruel and unusual punishment,\" Dixon v. Godinez, \n114 F.3d 640, 642  (7th Cir.  1997 , prison officials have a duty to insure that inmates \nreceive adequate food, clothing, sheIt r and medical care.  Sanville v. McCaughtt:y, 266 F.3d \n724, 733 (7th Cir. 2001) (citing Fa  er v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994)).  Failure \nto provide an inmate \"nutritionally  dequate food\" may violate the Eighth Amendment if \nit continues for an extended period.  Antonelli v. Sheehan, 81 F.3d 1422, 1432 (7th Cir. \n1996). \nIn  determining whether  pia ntiff's  allegations  state  a  claim  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment, the critical question i  whether the allegations show that defendants were \ndeliberately indifferent to a substanti I risk of serious harm to the inmate's health or safety. \n8 \n\nSanville, 266 F.3d at 733.  This in  uiry can be broken down into objective and subjective \ncomponents.  The objective comp  nent is whether the alleged deprivation is sufficiently \nserious. The subjective component  eals with the defendants' state of mind and whether the \ndefendants were deliberately indiffe ent to plaintiffs plight.  Delaney v. DeTella, 256 F.3d \n679,683 (7th Cir. 2001). \na.  Serious risk of harm \nA serious risk of harm to a  inmate can arise from denial of \"minimal civilized \nmeasures of life's necessities.\"  Reed  . McBride, 178 F.3d 849, 852 (7th Cir. 1999) (citing \nDixon, 114 F.3d at 640). A court m  st weigh the amount and duration of any deprivation \nin determining its seriousness.  Reed, 178 F.3d at 853.  Several courts have stated that the \namount and duration of the depriv tion are inversely proportional such that substantial \ndeprivations of food may violate the  ighth Amendment despite relatively short durations. \nDeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 9  4 (10th Cir. 2001) (citing Iohnson v. Lewis, 217 F.3d \n726, 732 (9th Cir. 2000)).  In his se  ond amended complaint, plaintiff alleges that he has \nbeen deprived of hundreds of meals  er a three to four year period because of his failure to \nfollow the Secure Program Facility's p ocedure for meal delivery. Plaintiff alleges that he was \ndenied all meals for at least two co  secutive days in the follOwing months:  April 2001, \nJanuary 2002, April 2002, June and J  ly 2002, January 2003, February 2003, March 2003, \n9 \n\nSeptember 2003 and October 2003.  laintiff alleges that on two occasions, in July 2002 and \nOctober 2003, he did not receive a s ngle meal for at least eight consecutive days.  During \nthese periods of deprivation,  plain 'ff alleges,  he was  not given any increased medical \nattention despite suffering a myriad  f physical and mental problems. \nDefendants argue that the Se ure Program Facility'S meal delivery policy does not \nviolate the Eighth Amendment. I do  ot understand petitioner's second amended complaint \nto present a facial challenge to the  olicy.  Rather, as I  read the complaint, petitioner is \nalleging that defendants'  implemen ation  of the policy is  unconstitutional because its \nenforcement has resulted in the deni I of hundreds of meals on at least a semi-regular basis \nover several years and for more than a week at a time on two occasions.  Plaintiff does not \nattack the policy on its face, but rat  er its application to him.  Considering that plaintiff \nalleges denial of hundreds of meals  ver the course of three to four years, including two \nperiods in which plaintiff did not r  ceive one meal for more than a week straight, I am \nsatisfied that plaintiffs allegations ar  objectively serious enough to constitute a substantial \nrisk of serious harm to his health. Co  are Berry v. Brady, 192 F.3d 504,506-07 (5th Cir. \n1999) (ruling that denial of eight m  als over seven month period did not support Eighth \nAmendment claim) and Talib v. Gill  ,138 F.3d 211 (5th Cir. 1998) (affirming dismissal \nof claim alleging denial of fifty meals  ver course of five months) with DeMaio v. Mann, 877 \nF. Supp. 89, 93 (ND.N.Y. 1995) (st ting that deprivation of food and clothing for twelve \n10 \n\nconsecutive days would be \"'sufficie  t1y serious' to trigger Eighth Amendment concerns\") \nand  Moss  v.  Ward,  450  F.  Sup.  591,  596-97  (W.D.N.Y.  1978)  (finding  Eighth \nAmendment violation where inmat  received no meals for four consecutive days and one \nmeal during each of next three days). \nb.  Deliberate indifference \nTo satisfy the subjective  pr ng,  an inmate must allege,  at a  minimum, \"actual \nknowledge of impending harm easilY  reventable.\"  Delaney, 256 F.3d at 683 (emphasis in \noriginal).  The Supreme Court has sated that \"it is enough that the official acted or failed \nto act despite his knowledge of a subs  ntial risk of serious harm.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842. \nIn making this determination, I can consider whether \"the circumstances suggest that the \nofficial being sued had been exposed  information concerning the risk and thus 'must have \n0 \nknown' about it.\" Turnerv. Miller, 3  I F.3d 599,603-04 (7th Cir. 2002) (quoting Farmer, \n511 U.S. at 842). \nPlaintiff alleges that defenda  t Berge conducts weekly \"Special Needs\" meetings at \nwhich various prison officials meet  discuss problems with specific inmates.  Plaintiff \n0 \nalleges that defendants Berge, Huibre  e and Boughton attend the meetings, as do the unit \nmanagers.  (Defendants Sharpe and  ompe were the unit managers responsible for the units \nto which plaintiff was assigned durin  the periods relevant in this case.)  Although plaintiff \nII \n\nalleges that defendants Berge and Bo  ghton do not recall any discussion of plaintiffs refusal \nof meals at a \"Special Needs\" meeti  g, it is possible that defendants Berge and Boughton \nlearned of plaintiffs situation throu h other means.  In addition, Secure Program Facility \npolicy requires staff to record each i  stance of meal refusal in a unit log book and to notify \nunit managers verbally if an inmate  oes not eat for three straight days.  These allegations \nsuggest that defendants had exposur  to information concerning the risk to plaintiffs health \nand they do not assert that they we  unaware of it. \nDefendants argue that they  id not act with deliberate indifference; plaintiff made \nthe decision to refuse his meals by ch  osing not to comply with the meal delivery policy. His \nrefusal to comply with the meal deliv ry policy is the only reason why he missed some meals. \nIn a previous order in this case, I dis  issed this argument: \nTo accept defendants' argum  nt, I would have to conclude that prison officials may \ndisregard a substantial risk t  an inmate's health so long as the reason for doing so \nis the inmate's failure to com  Iy with prison rules.  It is one thing to acknowledge \nthat prison officials have a Ie  'timate interest in enforcing compliance with prison \nrules. It is quite another to co  clude that there are no limitations on the enforcement \nof those rules so long as the  isoner always has a choice to comply. \nOp. & Order, dkt. #129, at 16.  Ta  n to its extreme (but logical) conclusion, defendants' \nargument would preclude a finding 0  deliberate indifference even if defendants had allowed \nplaintiff to starve himself by not c  mplying with meal delivery rules.  At some point, \ndefendants' interest in enforcing pri on rules must give way to an obligation to prevent an \n12 \n\ninmate from committing slow suicid . Although it might suffice to leave it to the inmate to \ndecide  whether  he  wishes  to  com  ly  with  meal  delivery  rules  when  the  refusals  are \nintermittent or short-term, this han  s off attitude cannot continue when the number of \nmeals  denied reaches triple digits  nd the inmate does not receive any meals for eight \nconsecutive days. \nIt is settled law in this circuit  at prison officials may violate the Eighth Amendment \nif they are deliberately indifferent t  an inmate's risk of harming himself.  Matos ex reI. \nMatos v. O'Sullivan, 335 F.3d 557 (  th Cir. 2003); Cavalieri v. Shepard, 321 F.3d 616 (7th \nCir. 2003); Sanville v. McCaughtI)'.  66 F.3d 724 (7th Cir. 2001); Estate of Novack ex reI. \nTurbin v.  County of Wood, 226 F.  d 525 (7th Cir. 2000).  An official's reason for his \nbehavior is always relevant in deter  ining whether he acted with deliberate indifference. \nLunsford v.  Bennett,  17  F.3d  157  ,  1581-82  (7th Cir.  1994).  Defendants justify the \nfacility's meal delivery rule not as a s fety measure but instead as a way to prevent inmates \nfrom  exposing themselves  to priso  officials.  \"Although  this is  a  legitimate concern, \nprotecting  an  officer's  sensibilities  would  not  necessarily  justify  starving  a  prisoner \nindefinitely.\"  Op. & Order, dkt. #1  9, at 22. \nIn sum, I have expressed my  iew on two prior occasions in this case that plaintiff's \nallegations are sufficient to state a cl  im under the Eighth Amendment.  See Op.& Order, \ndkt. # 129; Order, dkt. # 159. Althou h prison officials are not constitutionally barred from \n13 \n\nusing food to discipline inmates for n isconduct, see Lemaire v. Maass, 12 F.3d 1444, 1455-\n56 (9th Cir. 1993), even recalcitrant prisoners are entitled to the minimal civilized measure \nof life's  necessities.  Farmer,  511  .S.  at 833-34.  Courts  in  other jurisdictions  have \nconcluded that inmates state valid E' ghth Amendment claims under similar circumstances. \nSee~, Phelps v. Kapnolas, 308 F.3  180 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that inmate stated claim \nunder Eighth Amendment by alleging that he was given nutritionally inadequate food for two \nweeks); Coo  er v. Sheriff Lubbock  ount  Texas, 929 F.2d 1078 (5th Cir. 1991) (ruling \nthat inmate stated claim under Eigh h Amendment by alleging denial of food for thirteen \ndays); Dearman v. Woodson, 429 F.  d 1288 (10th Cir. 1970) (finding valid § 1983 claim \nwhere inmate alleged food deprivatio  for approximately four days).  None of the arguments \nor  authority  provided  by defenda  ts  have  convinced  me  that this view is  incorrect. \nTherefore, I must determine wheth  the right was clearly established at the time of the \nviolation. \n2.  Clearly established right \nThe \"clearly established\" inqu'ry is conducted in the specific factual context of the \ncase.  Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.  In a recent case, the Supreme Court stated that \nFor a constitutional right to b  clearly established, its contours 'must be sufficiently \nclear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that \nright.  This is not to say that  n official action is protected by qualified immunity \n14 \n\n-\nunless the very action in que tion has previously been held unlawful ... but it is to \nsay that in light of pre-existi  g law the unlawfulness must be apparent.' \nHope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739 (  002) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, \n640 (1987)).  Plaintiff has the bur  en of showing that the right in question was clearly \nestablished  at  the  time  of the  vi  lation  and  may  point  to  \"closely  analogous  cases \ndemonstrating that the conduct is u  lawful or demonstrate that the violation is so obvious \nthat a reasonable state actor would  ow that what he is doing violates the Constitution.\" \nMcGreal v. Ostrov, 368 F.3d 657, 6  3 (7th Cir. 2004) (citing Morrell v. Mock, 270 F.3d \n1090, 1100 (7th Cir. 2001)).  Plai  tiff need not produce a case \"on all fours\" with the \npresent case to meet his burden, M  ntville v.  Lewis, 87 F.3d 900, 902 (7th Cir.  1996); \nindeed, in Hope, the Supreme Cour  stated that \"officials can still be on notice that their \nconduct violates established law eve  in novel factual circumstances.\"  Hope, 536 U.S. at \n741.  \"The salient question is not wether there is a prior case on all fours with the current \nclaim but whether the state of the la  at the relevant time gave the defendants fair warning \nthat their treatment of the plaintif  was unconstitutional.\"  McGreal, 368 F.3d at 683 \n(internal citations omitted). \nPlaintiff alleges that defenda  ts began denying him meals in 2000, so it is at that \npoint that I begin my examination of the law.  Before 2000, it was well-settled that inmates \nhave  a  right  under the Eighth Am  ndment to  receive  adequate  food  and other basic \n15 \n\nnecessities while imprisoned. See Fa mer, 511 U.S. at 832-33 (citing cases); Oliver v. Deen, \n77 F.3d 156,159 (7th Cir. 1996);  (eenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083,1091 (9th Cir.  1996) \n(\"Adequate food is a basic human n  ed protected by the Eighth Amendment\"); Woods v. \nThieret, 903 F.2d 1080, 1082 (7th :::ir. 1990);  Newman v. Alabama, 559 F.2d 283, 286 \n(5th Cir. 1977), modified sub. nom.  Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781 (1978) (\"It is much \ntoo late in the day for states and pri on authorities to think that they may withhold from \nprisoners the basic necessities of Iif , which include reasonably adequate food, clothing, \nshelter, sanitation, and necessary mee ical attention. \").  In 1991, the Supreme Court framed \nthe inquiry for a food deprivation clai n by stating that \"only those deprivations denying 'the \nminimal civilized measure of life's neFessities' ... are sufficiently grave to form the basis of \nan Eighth Amendment violation.\"  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991) (quoting \nRhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337,3 '17 (1981 )).  In addition to basic necessities oflife, the \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Cir uit recognizes an inmate's constitutional right \"to be \nprotected from self-destructive tend ncies.\"  Hall v.  Ryan, 957 F.2d 402, 406 (7th Cir. \n1992) (inmate suicide) (citing Tosenn v. Brierton, 739 F.2d 1244 (7th Cir. 1984)). \nAlso clearly established prior  2000 was the fact that diSciplinary sanctions used by \nt( \nprison officials to enforce internal rul~s and procedures are subject to Eighth Amendment \nscrutiny.  See Helling v.  McIGnney. ~09 U.S. 25, 31  (1993) (\"It is undisputed that the \ntreatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under which he is confined are \n16 \n\nsubject to scrutiny under the Eighth  endment. \").  As early as 1968, one circuit court of \nappeals stated that the protection  gainst cruel and unusual punishment sets limits on \ninternal  prison  discipline.  ackson v.  Bisho  , 404 F.2d 571, 580-81  (8th Cir.  1968) \n(\"Neither do we wish to draw ... an  meaningful distinction between punishment by way \nof sentence statutorily prescribed an  punishment imposed for prison disciplinary purposes. \nIt seems to us that the Eighth Amend  ent's proscription has application to both. \"); see also \nLoux v. Rhay. 375 F.2d 55,60 (9th  ir. 1967) (Hamley, J., dissenting) (\"While the matter \nof state prison discipline is not ordin  rily subject to examination in federal courts, the rule \nis otherwise if the treatment of a pris  ner amounts to cruel and unusual punishment within \nthe meaning of the Eighth Amendme  t\"). Courts of appeals, including the Court of Appeals \nfor the Seventh Circuit, continue t  recognize explicitly and implicitly that the Eighth \n4, \nAmendment is a check on prison of lcials' use of disciplinary measures.  Thomas v. \nRamos, 130 F.3d 754 (7th Cir. 1997) (considering inmate's Eighth Amendment challenge \nto lack of outdoor exercise while in di ciplinary segregation); White v. Nix, 7 F.3d 120 (8th \nCir. 1993) (considering Eighth Ame  dment challenge to placement of inmate in screened \ncell as punishment for altercation wi  another inmate); Ort v. White, 813 F.2d 318, 321 \n(11 th Cir.  1987)  (\"Eighth amendm nt principles apply not only to judicially imposed \npunishments, but also when conditio  s of confinement constitute the punishment at issue . \n. . . The limitations imposed by the amendment thus provide the proper framework for \n17 \n\nevaluating challenges to various sch  mes of prison discipline. \"); Madyun v. Franzen, 704 \nF.2d 954,960 (7th Cir. 1983) (\"W  have not hesitated to hold in appropriate cases that \nseriously disproportionate punishm nts meted out by state prison officials may violate the \nEighth Amendment.\"). \nWithin this circuit, the parti s point to Reed v. McBride, 178 F.3d 849 (7th Cir. \n1999), a case in which an inmate fil d suit, alleging that he had been deprived of meals for \nthree to five days at a time on severa  occasions.  He did not receive meals when he did not \nhave  his  identification  badge  at t  e  time  they were  served  and  he  did not have  his \nidentification badge on a number 0  occasions because he was not allowed to retrieve it \nwhenever he returned to the facility  fter receiving medical treatment at a hospital.  Id. at \n851.  The court noted that it had\"  ever addressed the question of whether depriving a \nprisoner of food for any period of ti  e violates the Eighth Amendment.\"  Id. at 853.  The \ncourt began its analysis by citing  ilson v.  Seiter, 501  U.S. 294 (1991), in which the \nSupreme Court stated \"in dicta that 't would be an Eighth Amendment violation to deny a \nprisoner an 'identifiable human ne d such as food.'\"  Reed,  178 F.3d at 853  (quoting \nWilson, 501 U.S. at 304).  Next, the  ourt cited three cases in which other circuit courts of \nappeal had analyzed food deprivation  laims and either found Eighth Amendment violations \nor concluded that the inmate's alleg  tions stated a claim under the Eighth Amendment. \nReed, 178 F.3d at 853.  The court  eld that a food deprivation claim could satisfy the \n18 \n\nobjective component of the Eighth  endment analysis depending on the \"amount and \nduration of the deprivation.\"  rd.  oting that the inmate in the case was ill prior to the \ndeprivations and the absence of any' extraordinary or extenuating circumstances,\" the court \nconcluded that the inmate's allegati  ns were sufficient to avoid dismissal.  Id. at 853-54. \nReed appears to be the only case in which the Court of Appeals for the Seventh \nCircuit has considered an Eighth Am ndment claim for food deprivation and its holding does \nnot clearly establish the unconstituti  nality of defendants' conduct in this case.  Moreover, \nReed is not \"on all fours\" with the  resent case because it does not appear that food was \nwithheld to discipline voluntary in  ate conduct or to compel a change in conduct.  Id. at \n851 (noting that inmate was not all  wed to retrieve identification badge needed to receive \nmeals).  In the absence of controlling authority in this circuit, I must look to decisions from \nother circuits that establish a clear  rend with respect to the issue.  Donovan v.  City of \nMilwaukee, 17 F.3d 944, 952 (7th  ir. 1994). \nCases dealing with the use of f  od deprivation as a diSciplinary measure indicate that \nthere are limits on the ability of priso  officials to withhold food because of inmate conduct. \nFor example, in Moss v. Ward, 450  . Supp. 951 (W.D.N.Y. 1978), an inmate alleged that \nhe was deprived of food for four day  because he did not follow a rule requiring inmates to \nturn in all oftheir utensils from their  st meal before they received their next meal. The rule \nwas designed to prevent prisoners fr  m using utensils to collect human waste to throw at \n19 \n\nprison guards. The inmate refused t  turn in a plastic cup, claiming that he needed it for his \ndentures.  The court granted summ  ry judgment to the inmate on his Eighth Amendment \nclaim, stating that \"prison officials cannot impose such severe sanctions for breaking a \ndisciplinary rule ... on prisoners wh n there is no showing that the prisoner is engaging in \nthe type of conduct the rule is desig  ed to prevent.  Id. at 596.  (I note that neither party \npresented evidence in conjunction  ·th this motion concerning whether plaintiff exposed \nhimself to prison officials  at meal  delivery times.)  The court stated further that the \n\"punishment was grossly  dispropo  ionate to the  offense  and went beyond what was \nnecessary to achieve the state's goals.'  Id. at 597.  See also Cunningham v. Tones, 567 F.2d \n653  (6th  Cir.  1977)  (remanding  for  further  factual  development  inmate's  Eighth \nAmendment challenge to \"slow sta  tion diet\" consisting of total deprivation of food for \nfour days and one meal every third d  y for several weeks thereafter imposed as punishment \nfor attempted escape). \nA similar policy was at issue in Williams v. Coughlin, 875 F. Supp. 1004 (W.D.N.Y. \n1995).  In Williams, an inmate all ged that he had been denied food for two days in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment b  cause he did not turn over utensils. The court refused \nto grant summary judgment to the prison officials,  relying on Moss and several other \ndecisions.  Id. at 10 11-13 (citing Rob es v. Co  hli, 725 F.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1983) (refusing \nto dismiss complaint alleging food de  rivation for twelve days); Dearman v. Woodson, 429 \n20 \n\nF.2d 1288 (10th Cir. 1970); Coo  e  v. Sheriff LubbockCount  Texas, 929 F.2d 1078 (5th \nCir. 1991); Hodge v. Ruperto, 739  . Supp. 873 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (allegations of food and \nwater deprivation and crowded an  unsanitary confinement allow reasonable inference of \ndeliberate indifference)).  The cour  ruled further that there was an issue of fact regarding \nthe question of deliberate indiffere  ce, noting that \"the risks of extended periods of food \ndeprivation might well be regarded  s obvious.\"  Williams, 875 F. Supp. at 1014. \nFinally, in Coo  erv.Sheriff  ubbockCoun  Texas, 929F.2d 1078 (5thCir. 1991), \nan inmate alleged food deprivation  y jail officials for thirteen days.  The officials argued \nthat the inmate was denied food on y because he did not follow a policy requiring inmates \nto be fully dressed for meals.  In a  dition, the officials argued that they were entitled to \nqualified immunity.  Noting that the  \"mere existence  of such  a  regulation  is  not an \nautomatic shield against a civil rig  ts suit,\" the court ruled that plaintiff's allegations of \ncontinuous food deprivation stated a claim under the Eighth Amendment.  Id. at 1083. \nBecause food deprivation was a \"fo m of corporal punishment,\" the Eighth Amendment \nimposed limits on its use.  Id.  Th  court also rejected the officials' qualified immunity \nargument because \"this circuit has I ng held that state prisoners are entitled to reasonably \nadequate food.\"  These cases illustr te what should be an obvious point:  the use of food \ndeprivation  as  a  disciplinary  meas  re  is  subject to the  limits  imposed by the Eighth \nAmendment, even when the only re  on for the deprivation is an inmate's failure to follow \n21 \n\nprison regulations. \nDefendants rely on several a ders issued by this court in other cases concerning the \nSecure Program Facility's meal deliv ry rules in which this court dismissed food deprivation \nclaims as legally frivolous.  Williams  . Ber e, No. 02-C-0070-C, 2002 WL 32350038, at *3 \n(W.D. Wis. Apr. 3,2002). Those c ses did not involve the extended periods of deprivation \nof all meals alleged by plaintiff in thO s case.  Williams concerned a prisoner who was denied \nbreakfast or lunch over the course  a month.  In the present case, plaintiff alleges denial \n0 \nof all meals on two separate occasio  s for eight consecutive days as well as at various other \ntimes over a three to four year perio  . The allegations of total deprivation presented in this \ncase stand in stark contrast to the c  mparably minor deprivations at issue in Williams. \nSetting aside the parsing of c se law, it appears that this case involves conduct that \na reasonable state actor would reco  nize as obviously beyond the limits set by the Eighth \nAmendment. It is difficult to see wh  defendants would need to resort to case law or statute \nbefore realizing that an inmate who did not receive hundreds of meals over a three or four \nyear period, including two week-Io  g stretches in which that inmate did not receive any \nmeals, was being subjected to cruel a  d unusual punishment regardless of the reason for the \ndeprivations.  Cf. Brown v. Thorn  s  n, 868 F. Supp. 326,330 (S.D. Ga. 1994) (\"Denial of \nfood and medical attention are, p  a facie,  clearly established violations of the Eighth \nAmendment ... As such, qualifie  immunity is  not appropriate in this context.  Any \n22 \n\nreasonable prison official is fully awa e that deprivation of food and medical care for serious \nmedical conditions is illegal; it woul  be beyond credibility for prison medical staff to claim \nignorance  as  to  the  potentially  c  nstitutional  implications  of denying  inmates  basic \nnecessities of life.\").  Considering th  amount and duration of the deprivations alleged by \nplaintiff, a reasonable state actor wo  ld know that defendants' persistence in enforcing the \nmeal delivery policy, even though pIa ntiff chose not to comply with it, denied plaintiff \"the \nminimal civilized measure of life's n  cessities.\"  Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 347. \nQualified immunity is design  d to give public officials \"the benefit of legal doubts.\" \nElliott v. Thomas, 937 F.2d 338, 34  (7th Cir. 1991). A prisoner's right to adequate food \nwas not in doubt in 2000 and has n  t been in doubt for years.  Likewise, the applicability \nof the Eighth Amendment to prison  isciplinary measures was clearly established by 2000. \nAssuming as I must that plaintiffs al egations are true, I find that defendants' conduct does \nnot straddle the line between legal  nd illegal conduct.  At this stage of the litigation, I \ncannot conclude that defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. \nB.  Moneta \nDefendants note that to the e  ent plaintiff seeks monetary damages from defendant \nBerge in his official capacity, plaint ffs claim is barred because defendant Berge is not \nsubject to suit under § 1983 in his 0  ficial capacity.  Sanville, 266 F.3d at 732-33 (official \n23 \n\ncapacity claims for money damages  ot cognizable under § 1983).  Plaintiff contends that \nhe is suing defendant Berge for mo  etary relief in his individual capacity and seeks only \ninjunctive  relief  against  defendant Berge  in  his  official  capacity.  A  plaintiff seeking \nprospective relief against a state offi  ial in his official capacity may bring his claim under § \n1983. Williams v. Wisconsin, 336 F 3d 576,580-81 (7th Cir. 2003). Thus, it appears that \ndefendants'  argument is  moot bec use  plaintiff is  not seeking monetary relief against \ndefendant Berge in his official capac ty. \nORDER \nIT IS ORDERED that defend nts' motion to dismiss is DENIED. \n'D \nEn tered this  ~ d Y of November, 2004. \nBY THE COURT: \n.. \n~~~.e.. -LL \nBARBARA B.

BERGE, et al., Defendants-Appellees.\nNo. 05-2820.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit.\nArgued November 7, 2005.\nDecided March 23, 2006.\n544 *544 David J. Harth, Sarah C. Walkenhorst (argued), Heller Ehrman LLP, Madison, WI, for Plaintiff-Appellant.\nCharles D. Hoornstra (argued), Peggy A. Lautenschlager, Office of the Attorney General, Wisconsin Department\nof Justice, Madison, WI, for Defendants-Appellees.\nBefore POSNER, EASTERBROOK, and WOOD, Circuit Judges.\nPOSNER, Circuit Judge.\nA jury in this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (denial of federal right under color of state law) found that the\ndefendants, officials at a Wisconsin prison, had inflicted cruel and unusual punishment on inmate Freeman by\ndenying him meals. The jury awarded him $50,000 in compensatory damages, plus punitive damages,\nincomprehensible in light of the evidence, aggregating $1.2 million. The judge granted judgment as a matter of\nlaw for the defendants. Freeman appeals from that judgment, seeking reinstatement of the jury's verdict.\nFreeman is serving a 58-year sentence in Wisconsin's maximum-security prison (nicknamed the \"Supermax,\" \nScarver v. Litscher, 434 F.3d 972 (7th Cir.2006); see Jones-El v. Berge, 374 F.3d 541, 542-43 (7th Cir.2004)) for a\nvariety of violent crimes. Inmates in the Supermax are fed their three meals a day in their cells. The prison's\nfeeding rule requires that the prisoner stand in the middle of his cell, with the lights on, when the meal is delivered\nand that he be wearing trousers or gym shorts. If the inmate does not comply with the rule, the meal is not served\nhim. Freeman wanted to eat in his underwear, so on a number of occasions over a two-and-a-half-year period he\nrefused to put on pants or gym shorts and as a result was not served, and because he skipped so many meals\nhe lost 45 pounds. The prison also refused to serve him when he had a sock on his head (which could be used\nas a weapon, depending on what was in it), when his cell walls were smeared with blood and feces that he\nrefused to clean, and when he was asleep.\nHis behavior was disgusting. But he argues that denial of food is a cruel and unusual punishment for the violation\nof a prison rule or norm. It is certainly an unusual form of punishment nowadays, and in cases in which it inflicts\n545 serious harm on the prisoner it is also cruel. Reed v. McBride, 178 F.3d 849, 853-54 (7th Cir. *545 1999); \nThompson v. Gibson, 289 F.3d 1218, 1222 (10th Cir.2002); see Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct.\n1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); Sanville v. McCaughtry, 266 F.3d 724, 733-34 (7th Cir.2001); Talib v. Gilley, 138\nF.3d 211, 214 n. 3 (5th Cir.1998). But there is a difference between using food deprivation as a punishment and\nestablishing a reasonable condition to the receipt of food. Suppose that when a guard delivered a food tray to\nFreeman, Freeman hurled it at the guard. Freeman would have missed a meal but it would be a consequence not\nof punishment but of a reasonable condition of being fed 00 that you not throw back the food in the server's face.\n97\nIn such a case Freeman would be the author of his deprivation rather than a victim of punishment. Rodriguez v.\nBriley, 403 F.3d 952 (7th Cir.2005).\nThe same is true here. The pants requirement may not seem a reasonable condition on receiving food, but it is.\nIn the words of the appellees' lawyer in his opening statement to the jury, \"There are two primary reasons.\nNumber one, there are a lot of women security officers working in this facility so they are entitled to basic privacy.\nSecondly, there are security issues. Inmates throw urine, feces, expose themselves, ejaculate, and to prevent\nthat from happening to any security officer, there is a rule that the inmate must be clothed.\" The pants\n\nrequirement, violation of which was the major cause of Freeman's missed meals, imposed a condition that he\ncould readily have complied with; he offers no excuse for his noncompliance.\nHe missed some meals not because of the pants rule but because of the sock on the head, the blood and feces\non the wall, or his being asleep. The refusal to serve him in the first of these cases, whether or not authorized or\ndirected by any rule, cannot be thought unreasonable; the sock posed a potential threat to the guards. The\npossibility of contamination of the food by blood or feces might justify refusal to serve a meal in the second case,\nbut this is not argued. Unless the guards had difficulty waking him or were fearful as to how he might react to\nbeing wakened, his being asleep at mealtime would not be a good reason for not feeding him. But Freeman failed\nto show how many of his missed meals were missed for reasons that cannot be easily related to the refusal to\ncomply with a reasonable condition on the receipt of food, except that he testified that he received only one meal\na day for two weeks because he refused to keep his cell clean (at the end of that time prison employees cleaned\nit). That deprivation by itself would not in the circumstances of this case rise to the level of cruel and unusual\npunishment.\nThe reason for distinguishing between food deprivation as a punishment and food deprivation as a consequence\nof a refusal to comply with a condition precedent to being fed is that if as Freeman argues any deprivation of food\nis an unconstitutional punishment, a food policy cannot be enforced, at least against prisoners in Freeman's\nsituation. When we asked his lawyer what alternative response to her client's behavior would have been effective\nin getting Freeman to comply with the food policy, all she could think of was placing him in segregation (but he\nalready is in segregation 00 that is why he is being served all his meals in his cell), denying him good-time credits,\n97\nor depriving him of commissary and other privileges, such as a television set in his cell. Given the length of his\nsentence and what is plainly a propensity for obstreperous behavior, it is unlikely that a denial of good-time\ncredits will inflict significant disutility on him; and as far as denial of privileges is concerned, he has been denied\n546 privileges, without the *546 denial having deterred him from continuing to violate the food rule. The logic of his\nposition is that if he refuses any meal that is not prepared by Charlie Trotter, the prison must procure his meals\nfrom Trotter's catering service and cast about for some method unrelated to food of discouraging him from\nmaking such demands. Freeman refuses to take seriously the practical limitations of prison discipline as a means\nof maintaining an orderly environment.\nA better argument is that while alternative responses to Freeman's behavior may have seemed unpromising, food\ndeprivation turned out not to be very effective either, for it took more than two years for the deprivation to be\neffective 00 and it is not clear that hunger or the health effects of loss of weight was what motivated Freeman to\n97\nstart eating again. But we are pointed to no alternatives that would have been more efficacious.\nIt does not follow from anything we have said, however, that a prison can allow a prisoner to starve himself to\ndeath, or even starve himself to the point at which he seriously impairs his health, which could happen even if his\nending weight was \"normal\" (imagine a person whose weight falls from 250 to 150 pounds in a couple of\nmonths). The prison cannot be forced by such tactics to change an otherwise reasonable rule, Rodriguez v.\nBriley, supra, 403 F.3d at 953; Pearson v. Ramos, 237 F.3d 881, 886 (7th Cir.2001); Talib v. Gilley, supra, 138\nF.3d at 216; In re Caulk, 125 N.H. 226, 480 A.2d 93, 96 (1984); People ex rel. Illinois Dept. of Corrections v.\nMillard, 335 Ill.App.3d 1066, 270 Ill.Dec. 407, 782 N.E.2d 966, 972 (2003), but at some point it may have to force-\nfeed the prisoner to prevent him from seriously endangering his health.\nTwo situations can be distinguished. In the first, the prisoner is insane, and his insanity causes him to refuse\nfood; the prison is constitutionally obligated to treat his mental illness, if necessary by force-feeding him. Sanville\nv. McCaughtry, 266 F.3d 724, 733-34 (7th Cir.2001); Comstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 703 (6th Cir. 2001). In\nthe second situation, the prisoner is perfectly sane, but he either wants to commit suicide (and there are rational\nsuicides) or he is prepared to risk death from a hunger strike to make a political point. Free people who are sane\nhave a liberty interest in refusing life-saving medical treatment, Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, 497\nU.S. 261, 278-79, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990); see Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 722 n.\n17, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997), and likewise in refusing to eat, Blouin ex rel. Estate of Pouliot v.\nSpitzer, 356 F.3d 348, 359 (2d Cir.2004); Bouvia v. Superior Court, 179 Cal.App.3d 1127, 225 Cal.Rptr. 297, 300,\n305 (1986); see also Washington v. Glucksberg, supra, 521 U.S. at 723, 117 S.Ct. 2258, a method by which\nsome elderly people commit suicide. Ronald M. Holmes & Stephen T. Holmes, Suicide: Theory, Practice, and\n\nInvestigation 59-60 (2005); Martin Tolchin, \"When Long Life Is Too Much: Suicide Rises Among Elderly,\" New\nYork Times, July 19, 1989, p. A1. But either prisoners don't have such an interest, or it is easily overridden. In re\nGrand Jury Subpoena John Doe, 150 F.3d 170, 172 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam); Martinez v. Turner, 977 F.2d 421,\n423 (8th Cir.1992); Laurie v. Senecal, 666 A.2d 806, 809 (R.I.1995); In re Caulk, supra, 480 A.2d at 96-97; State\nex rel. White v.

Prevatte, 248 Ga. 832, 286\nS.E.2d 715, 716-17 (1982).\n547 *547 The reasons are practical. (No longer does one hear that prisoners must not be allowed to evade\npunishment by killing themselves and thus \"cheating the gallows.\") If prisoners were allowed to kill themselves,\nprisons would find it even more difficult than they do to maintain discipline, because of the effect of a suicide in\nagitating the other prisoners. Prison officials who let prisoners starve themselves to death would also expose\nthemselves to lawsuits by the prisoners' estates. Reckless indifference to the risk of a prisoner's committing\nsuicide is a standard basis for a federal civil rights suit. E.g., Boncher ex rel. Boncher v. Brown County, 272 F.3d\n484 (7th Cir.2001). The idea behind liability in such cases is that incarceration can place a person under unusual\npsychological strain and the jail or prison under a commensurate duty to prevent the prisoner from giving way to\nthe strain. The analysis is applicable when suicide takes the form of starving oneself to death. See Laurie v.\nSenecal, supra, 666 A.2d at 809; Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Dept. of Public Welfare v. Kallinger, 134\nPa.Cmwlth. 415, 580 A.2d 887, 893 (1990).\nSo at some point in Freeman's meal-skipping the prison doctors would have had a duty and certainly a right to\nstep in and force him to take nourishment. Knowing this, the prison has a policy of requiring a prisoner who has\nskipped all his meals for three consecutive days to be inspected by employees of the prison's health service to\nmake sure he isn't seriously endangering his health. Twice Freeman did not receive a timely inspection and as a\nresult, on each occasion, went eight days straight without a meal. But there is no indication that his life or health\nwas jeopardized. He lost 45 pounds over 31 months, but since he weighed 195 pounds at the beginning and is\nonly 5 foot 6 inches tall he ended up closer to the normal weight for a person of his height than when he began.\nNot that that is a complete defense, as we indicated earlier. Because of the irregularity of his eating, he\nexperienced unpleasant symptoms, such as blurred vision. But there is no evidence that the defendants knew\nthat he was endangering his health sufficiently to require drastic intervention. He was visited by nurses who\nconfirmed that he was taking water and checked his appearance through the window of his cell, and he was\nvisited by a doctor as well though at some point he began refusing to see the doctor. No doubt he would have\nsued the defendants for battery had they ordered him force-fed.\nBecause to an overwhelming degree Freeman's food deprivation was self-inflicted, even if not 100 percent of it\nwas, and the record contains no evidence that he experienced real suffering, extreme discomfort, or any lasting\ndetrimental health consequences, the judgment for the defendants must be, and it is,\nAFFIRMED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Berrell FREEMAN, Plaintiff-Appellant, \nv. \nGerald BERGE, Stephen Casperson, John Sharpe and Department of Corrections, Defendants-Respondents. \nNo. 2005AP86. | Dec. 22, 2005. \nAppeal from an order of the circuit court for Dane County: Shelley J. Gaylord, Judge. Affirmed. \nBefore LUNDSTEN, P.J., DYKMAN and HIGGINBOTHAM, JJ. \nOpinion \n¶ 1 PER CURIAM. \n \n*1 Berrell Freeman appeals an order dismissing a complaint that raised various claims against the Department of Corrections \nand three of its officers. The case was first removed to Federal Court; the district court dismissed Freeman’s federal claims \nand subsequently remanded to state court the three remaining State law claims: whether one of the defendants failed to \ncomply with WIS. ADMIN. CODE § DOC 303.76(6)(f) during a disciplinary proceeding against Freeman; whether the \nDepartment denied him the right to call witnesses at a hearing to extend his administrative confinement; and whether the \nDepartment unlawfully continues to rely on a certain incident report to administratively confine him when prior court \ndecisions have ordered the Department to expunge that report. We conclude the trial court properly ruled against Freeman on \nall three issues and affirm. \n  \n¶ 2 WISCONSIN ADMIN. CODE § DOC 307.76(6)(f) provides that the subject of a prison disciplinary proceeding must \nreceive an explanation of the decision in writing. Freeman alleged that respondent John Sharpe violated this rule in a \ndisciplinary proceeding concluded in May 2003. However, the right to seek review of a disciplinary decision in the circuit \ncourt depends on the inmate’s exhaustion of his or her administrative remedies. See WIS. STAT. § 801.02(7)(b) (2003-04).1 \nFor procedural issues, such as the one Freeman raised here, the administrative remedies include the inmate complaint review \nsystem. WIS. ADMIN. CODE § DOC 310.08(3). Here, Freeman did not file an inmate complaint seeking review of the \nalleged procedural error. \n  \n¶ 3 Freeman’s due process claim, that he was denied witnesses at an administrative confinement hearing, was untimely and \nproperly denied on that basis. WISCONSIN STAT. § 893.735(2) provides that an action seeking a remedy available by \ncertiorari, which is the case for Freeman’s claim, is barred unless commenced within forty-five days after the cause of action \naccrues. Freeman did not commence this action until nine months after the administrative confinement hearing at issue. \n  \n¶ 4 As determined in earlier litigation, Freeman has no basis to contend that the Department is using an expunged report to \nadministratively confine him. While incarcerated at Whiteville Correctional Facility in Tennessee, Freeman was charged with \na major disciplinary infraction for his role in a violent prison riot that occurred in November 1999. He was found guilty in a \ndisciplinary proceeding at the facility on December 9, 1999, and transferred to the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility \n(WSPF) (formerly Supermax Correctional Institution) in April 2000. Relying on the Whiteville disciplinary findings, the \nDepartment’s Administrative Confinement Review Committee (ACRC) ordered his placement in administrative confinement. \n  \n¶ 5 After seeking various administrative remedies, Freeman commenced this action by filing a petition for writ of habeas \ncorpus in which he challenged the Whiteville disciplinary decision, the decision transferring him to WSPF and the decision to \nplace him in administrative confinement. The trial court construed the petition as one seeking certiorari review of the three \n  1 \n \n\nState ex rel. Freeman v. Berge, 289 Wis.2d 219 (2005)   \n \nadministrative decisions and dismissed it because Freeman did not exhaust his administrative remedies before filing it. \nFreeman appealed and on review we reversed in part and remanded to allow Freeman to proceed on his challenge to the \nACRC decision of April 2000. State ex rel. Freeman v. Berge, 2002 WI App 213, ¶ 1, 257 Wis.2d 236, 651 N.W.2d 881. \n  \n*2 ¶ 6 Meanwhile, other inmates had successfully challenged administrative confinements also imposed because of their \nparticipation in the Whiteville riot, on the grounds that the subsequent Whiteville disciplinary proceedings were procedurally \ninvalid. See State ex rel. Curtis v. Litscher, 2002 WI App 172, ¶ 1, 256 Wis.2d 787, 650 N.W.2d 43. In such cases, this court \nheld the DOC could impose administrative confinement based on the Whiteville riot participation but only to the extent the \nDOC proved the inmate’s participation without relying on findings of the Whiteville disciplinary proceedings. Id., ¶ 1. \n  \n¶ 7 Consequently, the DOC vacated Freeman’s administrative confinement decision of April 2000 and conducted an \nindependent investigation of his conduct during the riot. After that investigation revealed Freeman’s significant participation \nin the riot, the ACRC again placed him in administrative confinement. In other words, Freeman’s administrative confinement \nno longer has any connection to the expunged document. \n  \nOrder affirmed. \n  \nThis opinion will not be published. See WIS. STAT.

Wisconsin.\nJune 3, 2003.\n1010 *1010 Berrell Freeman, Boscobel, WI, Pro se.\n1011 *1011 Corey F. Finkelmeyer, Assistant Attorney General, Madison, WI, for defendants.\nOPINION AND ORDER\nCRABB, District Judge.\nIn an order dated February 12, 2003, I allowed plaintiff Berrell Freeman to proceed in forma pauperis on claims\nthat defendants Gerald Berge and Jon Litscher violated his rights (1) to be free from unreasonable searches\nunder the Fourth Amendment and from excessive force under the Eighth Amendment; (2) to receive adequate\nfood under the Eighth Amendment; (3) to be free from extreme cell temperatures under the Eighth Amendment;\nand (4) to receive social interaction and sensory stimulation under the Eighth Amendment. Defendants have filed\na motion to dismiss most of these claims on multiple grounds. First, defendants contend that plaintiff has failed to\nexhaust his administrative remedies for each of his claims except for his claim regarding extreme cell\ntemperatures. Second, they argue that plaintiff's claim that he was denied food in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment is barred by the settlement agreement in Jones `El v. Berge, No. 00-C-421-C. Third, they argue that\nthey are entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff's claims that he was denied social interaction and sensory\nstimulation.\nDefendants' motion will be granted in part and denied in part. I agree with defendants that plaintiff failed to\nexhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claim that defendants subjected him to unconstitutional\nstrip searches. Also, I agree that defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff's claims that defendants\ndeprived him of social interaction and sensory stimulation in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Accordingly, I will\ndismiss these claims. However, I conclude that plaintiff has administratively exhausted his claim that defendants\ndenied him adequate food and that this claim is not barred by the Jones `El settlement agreement.\nAlso before the court is plaintiff's second motion for appointment of counsel. Because I am not persuaded that\nappointed counsel is appropriate in this case, plaintiff's motion will be denied.\nFor the purpose of deciding this motion to dismiss, I accept as true the allegations in plaintiff's complaint. In\naddition, I have considered documentation of plaintiff's use of the inmate complaint review system. Because\nthese are public records, a court may take judicial notice of the documents without converting the motion to\ndismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. Thompson, 161 F.3d 449,\n455 (7th Cir. 1998).\nFACTS\nIn inmate complaint number WSPF-2002-41916, dated December 2, 2002, plaintiff wrote: \"Due to the Settlement\nAgreement food is not to be used as punishment. I have been denied food because I did not have my light on,\netc. This is using food as punishment. I HAVE NEVER REFUSED MY MEALS.\" The inmate complaint examiner\n\nrecommended that the complaint be dismissed, writing that the policies regarding meal delivery were reasonable.\nThe reviewer, the corrections complaint examiner and the office of the secretary affirmed the dismissal.\nIn complaint number WSPF-2002-41987, also dated December 2, 2002, plaintiff wrote that the \"lack of access to\nthe outdoors deprives me of my basic human need for sensory stimulation.\" The inmate complaint examiner\n1012 recommended that the complaint be dismissed, concluding that \"complainant has provided no evidence *1012\nwhatsoever that he resides in an environment harmful to his well-being.\" The decision was affirmed by the\nreviewer, the corrections complaint examiner and the office of the secretary.\nPlaintiff filed inmate complaint number WSPF-2002-41219 on November 25, 2002, in which he wrote that he has\nbeen \"subjected to 24 hour monitoring by video/audio denying me meaningful human contact.\" The inmate\ncomplaint examiner rejected the complaint, stating, \"The issues in this complaint have been addressed in\nWSPF-2002-41987.\" This decision was affirmed by the corrections complaint examiner and the office of the\nsecretary.\nOn December 9, 2002, plaintiff filed inmate complaint number WSPF-2002-42678. He wrote: \"Due to the 24 hour\nlighting I have suffered from decreased vision/associated medical problems.\" The inmate complaint examiner\nnoted that there was \"nothing noted regarding decreased vision from the lighting at WSPF in plaintiff's last eye\ndoctor report from January 28, 2002.\" The examiner recommendation that the complaint be dismissed, a decision\nthat was affirmed by the reviewer, the corrections complaint examiner and the office of the secretary.\nIn complaint number WSPF-2002-17961, plaintiff wrote that he was subject to monthly cell and strip searches.\nThe inmate complaint examiner recommended that the complaint be dismissed and plaintiff did not appeal that\ndecision.\nOPINION\nI. FAILURE TO EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES\nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), prohibits the bringing of any action \"with respect to\nprison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail,\nprison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\" Section\n1997e(a)'s exhaustion requirement is mandatory and applies to all prisoners seeking redress for wrongs\noccurring in prison. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Seventh Circuit has held that \"a suit filed by a prisoner before administrative remedies have been\nexhausted must be dismissed; the district court lacks discretion to resolve the claim on the merits.\" Perez v.\nWisconsin Dept. of Corrections, 182 F.3d 532, 535 (7th Cir. 1999); see also Massey v. Helman, 196 F.3d 727 (7th\nCir.1999). The potential effectiveness of an administrative response bears no relationship to the statutory\nrequirement that prisoners first attempt to obtain relief through administrative procedures. Massey, 196 F.3d at\n733.\n\"Before an inmate may commence a civil action ... the inmate shall exhaust all administrative remedies that the\ndepartment of corrections has promulgated by rule.\" Wis. Admin. Code § DOC 310.05 (November 2002). (Plaintiff\nfiled at least one of the inmate complaints at issue in this case before the November amendments to Chapter\nDOC 310 became effective On December 1, 2002. However, the differences between the two versions are not\nrelevant to deciding this case.) Generally, to administratively exhaust a claim, an inmate must file a complaint\nwith an inmate complaint examiner, receive a decision on the merits and appeal an adverse decision to the\n\"appropriate reviewing authority,\" the corrections complaint examiner and the office of the secretary. Wis. Admin.\n1013 Code § DOC 310.07. (In limited instances not at issue in this case, the *1013 filing and appeal process is altered\nsomewhat.)\nAn inmate shall include only one issue in each complaint and file no more than two complaints each week. Wis.\nAdmin. Code §§ DOC 310.09(1)(e) and (2). The inmate complaint examiner may reject a complaint if it fails to\nallege sufficient facts upon which redress may be made, does not raise a \"significant issue,\" is untimely or raises\nan issue already addressed in another complaint, among other reasons. Wis. Admin. Code § DOC 310.11(4).\n\nTo exhaust administrative remedies, a prisoner must observe the procedural requirements of the system. Pozo v.\nMcCaughtry, 286 F.3d 1022, 1023 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"unless the prisoner completes the administrative process by\nfollowing the rules the state has established for that process, exhaustion has not occurred\"). Any other approach\nwould defeat the statutory objective of allowing the prison administration the opportunity to fix the problem, id. at\n1024, and would remove the incentive that § 1997e provides for inmates to follow state procedure, id. at 1025.\nThe first issue concerns plaintiff's claim that he was denied sensory stimulation and social interaction. The factual\nallegations underlying this claim are that he lacked access to the outdoors, and was subject to 24-hour lighting\nand audio and video monitoring. Defendants contend that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies\nwith respect to this claim because he never challenged the prison's policies regarding lighting, monitoring and the\noutdoors in one complaint. Instead, he filed complaints addressing each of these issues separately.\nI disagree with defendants that plaintiff was required to put all of these allegations in one grievance. They are\nseparate occurrences involving separate facts. What joins these allegations is a legal theory, recognized in \nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 305, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991), that multiple conditions having \"a\nmutually enforcing effect\" on one human need may violate the Eighth Amendment in combination when they\nwould not do so alone. Defendants point to no regulation requiring inmates to put all allegations encompassed by\na legal theory in a single complaint. Rather, the regulations instruct inmates to include only \"one issue\" in each\ncomplaint. Wis. Admin. Code. § 310.09(1)(e) (November 2002). Although the term \"issue\" as used in the\nregulation has not been construed in the case law, it appears that examiners are interpreting issues to mean \nfactual issues and not legal issues. See Horton v. Berge, No. 02-C-470-C, dkt. # 50 (W.D.Wis. March 12, 2003)\n(granting defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies when plaintiff included in\nhis inmate complaint \"a variety of grievances relating to sensory deprivation and social isolation\" and examiner\nrejected complaint because it contained more than one issue).\nDefendants cannot have it both ways. An inmate must be permitted to either separate or join his allegations\nregarding isolation and sensory deprivation; defendants cannot make it impossible for inmates to file claims\ninvolving the type of claim identified in Wilson. Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646, 649 (7th Cir.2002) (\"[N]o prison\nsystem may establish a requirement inconsistent with the federal policy underlying § 1983.\"). So long as plaintiff\nhas employed the administrative review system to timely raise all the factual issues encompassed by a particular\nlegal claim, the regulations do not require an inmate to combine all of his grievances into one complaint. (A\n1014 colorable argument could be made that plaintiff failed to administratively exhaust his claim with respect *1014 to\nthe issue of 24-hour lighting because he did not refer expressly to sensory deprivation in his prison grievance.\nHowever, defendants did not make this argument, so I will leave its resolution for another day.)\nThe next issue concerns the timing of plaintiff's grievances in relation to the date of the settlement agreement in \nJones `el v. Berge, No. 00-C-421-C, to which plaintiff is party and which addresses many of the claims that\nplaintiff raised in his complaint. Defendants argue that because plaintiff filed many of his grievances after the\nsettlement agreement took effect in March 2002, he is \"really\" alleging violations of the settlement agreement.\nTherefore, defendants contend, plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on his claims of social\nisolation and sensory deprivation for the period before the settlement agreement.\nI agree with defendants to the extent they are arguing that the settlement agreement limits the relief plaintiff may\nobtain in this lawsuit for injuries he has sustained as a result of social isolation and sensory deprivation. In the\nMarch 12, 2003 order allowing plaintiff leave to proceed, I noted that if plaintiff believed that defendants were\nviolating the settlement agreement, he should direct his concerns to the monitor rather than file a separate\nlawsuit. However, plaintiff remained free to maintain a lawsuit for money damages for conditions that existed \nbefore the settlement agreement took effect.\nDefendants' argument that plaintiff is barred completely from proceeding on his social isolation and sensory\ndeprivation claims is based on an assumption that because plaintiff filed his grievances after the settlement\nagreement, he did not intend to challenge conditions as they existed before the settlement agreement. This\nassumption is not justified. Nothing in plaintiff's prison grievances suggest that he intended them to be time\nrestricted. Thus, plaintiff's grievances should be construed as challenging the conditions as they existed since he\nwas transferred to the Secure Program Facility, which was before March 2002.\n\nIt is true that the regulations permit examiners to reject complaints as untimely if they are filed more than 14 days\nafter the event giving rise to a claim. Wis. Admin. Code § DOC 310.11(4)(d). Regardless whether this\nrequirement would apply to ongoing violations, it is undisputed that the examiners did not reject plaintiff's\ncomplaint for untimeliness or limit consideration of the question raised to a particular time period. Thus, I\nconclude that plaintiff has administratively exhausted these claims.\nDefendants also argue that plaintiff's claim that he was denied food in violation of the Eighth Amendment is\nbarred by the settlement agreement because the agreement contains a provision covering the use of food as\npunishment. However, even assuming that all of plaintiff's claims regarding the deprivation of food arose after\nMarch 2002, he is not barred from litigating that issue in this suit. The issue of using food as punishment was not\ncertified for class treatment in Jones `El or otherwise presented to the court. As I explained in Gonzalez v.\nLitscher, 230 F.Supp.2d 950 (W.D.Wis. 2002), as a general rule, unless an issue in a class action is approved for\nclass treatment, the inclusion of that issue in a settlement agreement will not prohibit subsequent lawsuits\nseeking to litigate constitutional claims involving the same issue. Otherwise, class members could be bound by\nsettlements with respect to issues for which they had no adequate representation and little or no opportunity to be\nheard.\n1015 *1015 The plaintiffs in Jones `El did not allege that inmates were being denied food unlawfully and I did not certify\nthe issue for class treatment. Thus, the settlement agreement does not bar plaintiff from litigating this issue in this\ncase, insofar as he is alleging that the denial of food violates the Eighth Amendment and not just the settlement\nagreement.\nFinally, I agree with defendants that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claim\nthat he was strip searched in violation of the Fourth and Eighth Amendments. Plaintiff did not appeal his inmate\ncomplaint regarding strip searches. By failing to appeal the dismissal, plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies. Pozo, 286 F.3d at 1024. Accordingly, I will dismiss plaintiff's claim that he was unlawfully strip searched\nfor failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.\nII. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nDefendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff's claims that he was denied social\ninteraction and sensory stimulation. Qualified immunity provides officers with protection from lawsuits for money\ndamages when there is no clearly established law that the official's act violated the Constitution. Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 817-18, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). A plaintiff cannot show that the law is\nclearly established by pointing to an \"abstract right.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034,\n97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). However, it is not necessary to show that there is an identical case or one with \"materially\nsimilar\" facts. Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). Rather, a right is \"clearly\nestablished\" when a reasonable official would know that what he or she is doing violates that right. Id.\nThe legal theory under which I allowed plaintiff to proceed was first recognized by the Supreme Court in Rhodes\nv. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), in which the court stated that conditions\n\"alone, or in combination, may deprive inmates of the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\" This\nstatement was further refined in Wilson v. Seiter: \"Some conditions of confinement may establish an Eighth\nAmendment violation `in combination' when each would not do so alone, but only when they have a mutually\nenforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single, identifiable human need.\" The Court identified expressly\nonly \"food, warmth [and] exercise\" as human needs. See also Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970,\n128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (stating that life's necessities include food, clothing, shelter and medical care).\nIn Jones `El, I concluded that basic human needs include social interaction and sensory stimulation. Although the\nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has recently confirmed the view that the Eighth Amendment prohibits\nwanton infliction of psychological as well as physical pain, Calhoun v. DeTella, 319 F.3d 936 (7th Cir.2003), it has\nnot expressly held that social isolation and sensory deprivation may serve as bases for a claim under the Eighth\nAmendment. Rather, in Bono v. Saxbe, 620 F.2d 609, 614 (7th Cir.1980), the court held: \"Inactivity, lack of\ncompanionship and a low level of intellectual stimulation do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment even if\n\nthey continue for an indefinite period of time.\" But see Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1257-58 (9th Cir.1982)\n(\"The deprivation of nearly all fresh air and light, particularly when coupled with the guard's control over the\n1016 window and the electric light, creates an extreme hazard to the physical and mental *1016 well-being of the\nprisoner in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\"); Ruiz v. Johnson, 37 F.Supp.2d 855, 915 (S.D.Tex.1999) (finding\nthat prison officials violated Eighth Amendment when they subjected inmates to \"extreme social isolation and\nreduced environmental stimulation\"); Madrid v. Gomez, 889 F.Supp. 1146, 1264 (N.D.Cal.1995) (placement of\nmentally ill inmates in segregation is cruel and unusual punishment).\nI noted in Jones `El that Bono does not stand for the proposition that claims of social isolation and sensory\ndeprivation can never amount to violations of the Eighth Amendment. I adhere to the view that harm caused by\nlack of human contact and sensory stimulation may violate \"contemporary standards of decency\" in some\ninstances. However, with Bono as the only case as a guide in this circuit, it would not be unreasonable for a\nprison official to believe that constant cell illumination, audio and visual monitoring and lack of access to the\noutdoors did not violate the Eighth Amendment, alone or in combination. Although the determination whether a\nlaw is clearly established is not limited to a review of cases in this circuit, I cannot say that there was such a\n\"clear trend\" in the case law from other courts that it was \"merely a question of time\" that the right would be\nrecognized by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Jacobs v. City of Chicago, 215 F.3d 758, 767 (7th\nCir.2000). Few courts have addressed the issue directly and those that have are not in agreement regarding what\nthe Eighth Amendment requires. Compare Ruiz, 37 F.Supp.2d 855and Madrid, 889 F.Supp. 1146,with Newman\nv. State of Alabama, 559 F.2d 283, 291 (5th Cir.1977) (rejecting argument that deterioration of mental health\nimplicates Eighth Amendment concerns); Everson v. Nelson, 941 F.Supp. 1048, 1051 (D.Kan.1996) (holding that\n\"retrogression of human development\" does not state claim under Eighth Amendment); see also Gertrude\nStrassburger, Judicial Inaction and Cruel and Unusual Punishment, 11 Temp. Pol. & Civ. Rts. L.Rev. 199 (2001)\n(\"[N]o state or federal court has ever held that isolation for prolonged periods of time is a constitutional violation\nper se.\")\nSince the court of appeals decided Bono, evidence has accumulated regarding the harm that depriving inmates\nof social interaction and sensory stimulation can cause. See Leena Kurki & Norval Morris, Purposes, Practices\nand Problems of Supermax Prisons, 28 Crime & Just. 385 (2001) (evaluating studies and concluding that solitary\nconfinement will have detrimental psychological effects unless it lasts only a short time); Maria Dorte Sestoft, et\nal., Impact of Solitary Confinement on Hospitalization among Danish Prisoners in Custody, 21 Int'l J.L. &\nPsychiatry 99 (1998) (finding that rate of hospitalization of prisoners in solitary confinement for more than four\nweeks was 20 times higher than prisoners in the general population); Craig Haney & Mona Lynch, Regulating\nPrisoners of the Future: A Psychological Analysis of Supermax and Solitary Confinement, 23 N.Y.U. Rev. L. &\nSoc. Change 477, 481 (1997) (\"[C]onstitutional doctrines currently governing solitary confinement fail to\nrecognize the nature and magnitude of the psychological trauma that can be inflicted by this form of\npunishment.\"); Stuart Grassian, Psychological Effects of Solitary Confinement, 140 Am. J. Psychiatry 1450\n(1983) (finding that many inmates in solitary confinement for long periods of time became hypersensitive to\nexternal stimuli, suffered from hallucinations, perceptual distortions, paranoia and acute anxiety attacks, had\ndifficulty with memory and concentration and engaged in self-mutilation). However, agreement among mental\n1017 health professionals *1017 regarding the deleterious effects of solitary confinement does not translate into legal\nnotice that defendants may have been violating the Eighth Amendment. In the absence of case law concluding\nthat conditions similar to those alleged by plaintiff are unconstitutional, I must conclude that defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff's claims that he was subjected to sensory deprivation and social\nisolation.\nQualified immunity does not apply to claims for injunctive relief. However, plaintiff cannot obtain injunctive relief\non these claims because such relief is preempted by the settlement agreement. Accordingly, these claims must\nbe dismissed.\nTwo of plaintiff's claims remain: (1) his claim that defendants denied him food in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment; and (2) his claim that defendants subjected him to extreme cell temperatures in violation of the\nEighth Amendment. Defendants do not argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on these claims, so I do\nnot address that issue. All other claims are dismissed.\n\nIII. MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL\nPlaintiff argues that the court should appoint counsel for him because he suffers from a mental illness and the\ncase is too complex for him to prosecute on his own. It appears that plaintiff has complied with the requirements\nof Jackson v. County of McLean, 953 F.2d 1070 (7th Cir.1992), by first attempting to obtain representation on his\nown from at least three lawyers. However, before I may appoint counsel for plaintiff, I must conclude that plaintiff\nis unable to represent him or herself given the complexity and the presence of counsel would make a difference\nin the outcome of his lawsuit. Zarnes v. Rhodes, 64 F.3d 285 (7th Cir. 1995) (citing Farmer v. Haas, 990 F.2d 319,\n322 (7th Cir.1993)).\nI am not persuaded that plaintiff is unable to represent himself. Although plaintiff contends that he is mentally ill,\nthere is no indication that he is incapable of prosecuting cuting this case. Rather, plaintiff's numerous\nsubmissions to the court in both this lawsuit and others belie his assertion that counsel is necessary. Further,\nplaintiff's most complicated claims were those in which he contended that defendants deprived him of sensory\nstimulation and social interaction. Plaintiff's two remaining claims are not unduly complex. With respect to his\nfood deprivation claim, plaintiff will have to present evidence that he was denied food for so long that his health\nwas threatened. See Reed v. McBride, 178 F.3d 849, 853 (7th Cir.1999); LeMaire v. Maass, 12 F.3d 1444 (9th\nCir.19-93). Similarly, to prove his claim that the temperatures in his cell violated the Eighth Amendment, he will\nhave to present evidence that the temperatures were so extreme that there was a substantial risk of serious harm\nto his health or safety. Dixon v. Godinez, 114 F.3d 640, 642 (7th Cir.1997); Shelby County Jail Inmates v.\nWestlake, 798 F.2d 1085, 1087 (7th Cir. 1986). It is true that plaintiff may need to obtain expert testimony to\nprove one or both of these claims. Plaintiff argues that he is indigent and will be unable to pay for an expert.\nUnfortunately for plaintiff, the desire to shift the costs of litigation to a third party is not an appropriate\nconsideration in determining whether to appoint counsel. If plaintiff is unable to persuade any lawyers she wrote\nto take his case on a contingency basis, this may be because they have determined that the case is not likely to\nsucceed or will not result in a damage award large enough to recoup the expense of prosecuting the case. It is\n1018 inappropriate for a court to ask a lawyer to *1018 take the case without regard for his or her assessment of the\nrisks of incurring the expense of the lawsuit against the probability of succeeding on the merits of the case. If\nplaintiff is to be represented by counsel, he will have to find counsel on his own. If he wishes, he may contact the\nWisconsin State Bar Lawyer Referral and Information Service at P.O. Box 7158, Madison, Wisconsin, 53707,\n1-800-362-8096, to obtain the names and phone numbers or addresses of lawyers whose practices include\nEighth Amendment cases.\nORDER\nIT IS ORDERED that\n1. The motion to dismiss filed by defendants Gerald Berge and Jon Litscher is DENIED with respect to plaintiff\nBerrell Freeman's claim that he was denied food in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n2. Defendants' motion is GRANTED with respect to plaintiff's claims that he was strip searched in violation of the\nFourth and Eighth Amendments and that he was subjected to sensory deprivation and social isolation in violation\nof the Eighth Amendment. These claims are DISMISSED from this action.\n3. Plaintiff's second motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": " \n  \n2003 WL 23277412 \nOnly the Westlaw citation is currently available. \nUnited States District Court, \nW.D. Wisconsin. \nBerrell FREEMAN, Plaintiff, \nv. \nGerald Berge and Jon E. LITSCHER, Defendants. \nNo. 03–C–0021–C. | July 30, 2003. \nAttorneys and Law Firms \nDavid J. Harth, for Plaintiff. \nCorey F. Finkelmeyer, Assistant Attorney General, Madison, WI, for Defendants. \nOpinion \n \nORDER \nCROCKER, Magistrate J. \n*1 Before the court are plaintiff Berrell Freeman’s motions to compel the defendants to provide more \ncomplete  responses  to  his  First  Request  for  Production  of  Documents  and  Request  for  Admissions \n(dkts.29–31). Defendants have objected to all but two of plaintiff’s document requests on the ground that \nthey seek information related to claims that this court has dismissed from this lawsuit. Defendants made the \nsame objection to plaintiff’s requests for admissions; at the same time, however, they answered each \nrequest with a categorical denial. Defendants maintain that most of the information plaintiff seeks is not \nrelevant to this lawsuit; plaintiff maintains that it is. \n  \nOnly two of plaintiff’s claims are still alive: 1) his claim that defendants violated his Eighth Amendment \nrights by subjecting him to extreme cell temperatures; and 2) his claim that defendants violated his Eighth \nAmendment rights when they denied him adequate food. In his submissions in support of his motion to \ncompel, plaintiff maintains that he should be allowed to argue that the “excessive temperatures, denial of \nfood, etc. together caused the plaintiff’s injuries,” pointing out that the Supreme Court has recognized a \n“totality of conditions” theory as a basis for an Eighth Amendment claim. Plaintiff is wrong. There is no \n“etc.”  in  this  case.  The  court  has  allowed  plaintiff  to  proceed  only  on  his  claims  relating  to  cell \ntemperatures and the denial of food, not the totality of the conditions existing at the Wisconsin Secure \nProgram Facility. \n  \nAs explained in this court’s decision on defendants’ motion to dismiss, although the Supreme Court has \nrecognized that some conditions of confinement may “in combination” establish an Eighth Amendment \nviolation when each would not do so alone, this theory is only viable when the particular conditions “have a \nmutually enforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single, identifiable human need.” Wilson v. \nSeiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991) (citing low nighttime cell temperature \nplus a failure to issue blankets as example). Although the court recognized in previous orders that \nplaintiff’s allegations in his complaint might state a claim that certain conditions at SMCI/WSPF operated \ntogether to deprive him of a basic human need for social interaction and sensory stimulation, it dismissed \nthis claim on the ground that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on this issue. With respect to \nhis complaints of excessive cell temperatures and the use of food as punishment, the court held that each of \nthese claims alone stated independent Eighth Amendment claims. Plaintiff does not need to proceed on a \n“combination” theory with respect to these claims because each is adequate alone to state a violation of the \n\t\r   1\t\r  \n\nEighth Amendment. Furthermore, plaintiff has not identified a single basic human need that is disturbed by \nthe combined effect of the alleged food deprivation and excessive cell temperatures. Every condition that is \negregious enough to violate the Eight Amendment is likely to cause emotional pain and mental distress. \nThese psychological injuries are common human responses to unconstitutional behavior. The “need” to be \nfree from such injuries inflicted by others is not the kind of basic human need that was envisioned by the \nSupreme Court as warranting special treatment under the Eighth Amendment. \n  \n*2 Having clarified the scope of this lawsuit, I now turn to plaintiff’s specific discovery requests. \n  \n \nRequests for Admissions \nPlaintiff concedes that his Requests for Admission 1–7 seek medical opinions that defendants are not \nqualified to give. In Requests for Admission 8–14, plaintiff asks defendants to admit that plaintiff has \nsuffered from a variety of ailments while at SMCI/WSPF, including secretion of excessive gastric acid; \nconstant/frequent headaches; physical complaints that are without any diagnosable basis; despair and sleep \ndisorders; complications in breathing; distortions or illusions; and forgetfulness and confusion. Request for \nAdmission 15 asks defendants to admit that plaintiff has been placed on a medical diet while a prisoner at \nSMCI/WSPF. Defendants objected to every request as “irrelevant and outside the scope of this litigation \ngiven that the court has dismissed any and all claims related to the subject matter found in this admission \nrequest.” Notwithstanding that objection, the defendants categorically denied each of plaintiff’s requests. \n  \nBecause defendants have answered each of plaintiff’s requests, it is unnecessary to rule on the sufficiency \nof their relevance objection. Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a), a party who denies a request to admit \nshall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith \nrequires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an \nadmission is requested, the party shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or \ndeny the remainder. \nFed.R.Civ.P. 36(a). Plaintiff argues that defendants have violated this rule by denying his requests for \nadmissions categorically. However, plaintiff has not submitted any evidence or argument to support his \ncontention that defendants lacked a good faith basis for their denials. Absent evidence to the contrary, this \ncourt presumes that the defendants are familiar with Rule 36 and that they complied with it when they \ndrafted their answers to plaintiff’s requests for admissions. \n  \nThat said, I note that in their response to plaintiff’s motion to compel, defendants have asserted that \nplaintiff’s admissions seek “several mental and physical health determinations from defendants who are not \nqualified to provide such determinations.” If that is the reason defendants denied all of plaintiff’s requests \nfor admissions regarding his health while at SMCI/WSPF, then their responses are inadequate under Rule \n36. According to the rule, an answer to a request for admission “shall specifically deny the matter or set \nforth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the mater.” In other \nwords, “I don’t know” is different from a denial: when a party answers “I don’t know,” then he must \nexplain why not. \n  \nIn addition, the rule states that \n[a]n answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for \nfailure to admit or deny unless the party states that the party has made reasonable \ninquiry  and  that  the  information  known  or  readily  obtainable  by  the  party  is \ninsufficient to enable the party to admit or deny. \n*3 I don’t know the basis for defendants’ denials, so I cannot conclude that defendants’ responses are \ninadequate. To prevent misunderstandings, however, I am directing that defendants review their answers to \nensure full compliance with Rule 36, and to amend their answers forthwith if there are any deficiencies. \n  \n\t\r   2\t\r  \n\n \nDocument Requests \nI am denying plaintiff’s motion for an order compelling defendants to produce documents. Requests nos. 1–\n6, 8, 15 and 16 seek information relating to the effects of solitary confinement or the “behavioral \nmodification process” on a prisoner, including studies and evaluations of the SMCI/WSPF or other \nSupermax facilities by outside groups or individuals; policies regarding the placement and retention of \ninmates at the institution; and the incidence of depression, sleep disturbances and attempted suicide at \nSMCI/WSPF compared to other Wisconsin prisons. This information all relates to plaintiff’s claim that the \ntotality of the conditions at SMCI/WSPF deprived him of the basic human need for social interaction and \nsensory stimulation. As such, it is irrelevant to this lawsuit. \n  \nRequest  No.  7  seeks  copies  of correspondence exchanged between defendants and Dr. Gary Maier \naddressing the inadequacy of the mental health service at SMCI/WSPF. Request No. 12 seeks any \ndocuments that relate to “SMCI directing Dr. Maier to curtail the prescribing of sleep medications or other \nmedications.” It is unclear how this information relates to plaintiff’s claims that he was denied food as \npunishment and that he was subject to extreme cell temperatures. Plaintiff has not alleged in this case that \nprison officials were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. Absent such an allegation, I \npresume that these document requests are related to plaintiff’s “totality of conditions” claim, which has \nnow been dismissed. Accordingly, defendants will not be ordered to respond to these discovery requests. \n  \nRequest Nos. 10, 11 and 18 seek copies of various medical reports pertaining to the plaintiff. Even \nassuming some of these reports might be relevant to plaintiff’s claims regarding excessive cell temperatures \nand food deprivation, defendants do not have to produce them. In fact, because the records plaintiff seeks \nare confidential, defendants cannot have access to them unless plaintiff provides a signed medical release to \ndefendants. Plaintiff may obtain his own copies of his medical reports from the institution. \n  \nRequest No. 14 seeks information related to cell and strip searches. Because this court has dismissed \nplaintiff’s complaint regarding monthly cell and strip searches, defendants do not have to produce this \ninformation. \n  \nRequest No. 17 seeks copies of defendants’ “answers to interrogatories, admissions, depositions and \ndeclarations” previously given in the Jones ‘El v. Litscher case, 00–C–421–C. Although some of these \nmaterials might contain relevant information insofar as excessive cell temperature was an issue in the Jones \n‘El case, I am not ordering defendants to produce them. Plaintiff’s request is much too broad and it imposes \nan undue burden on defendants. Plaintiff may discover the information he needs by drafting his own \ninterrogatories tailored to the specific issues in his case. \n  \n*4 Finally, in a separate motion, plaintiff contends that defendants’ response to Request No. 9, which asked \nfor documents related to the adequacy of WSPF/SMCI’s heating and ventilation system, is inadequate \nbecause it does not include the temperature records for June 29, 2001 to July 25, 2001. Defendants have not \nopposed plaintiff’s request for those records. Accordingly, this motion will be granted. \n  \n \nORDER \nIT IS ORDERED: \n1. Plaintiff’s motion to compel defendants to produce more complete responses to his requests for \nadmissions (dkt.30) is DENIED. \n2. Plaintiff’s motion for an order compelling discovery (dkt.29) is DENIED. \n3. Plaintiff’s motion for an order to produce documents (dkt.31) is GRANTED. Defendants are \nordered to produce records showing the temperatures at SMCI between June 29, 2001 to July 25, \n\t\r   3\t\r  \n\n2001, if such documents exist. Plaintiff’s motion to compel the production of documents is denied in \nall other respects. \n\t\r   4\t\r  ",

THE DISPOSITION WILL APPEAR IN A \nREPORTER TABLE. \nCourt of Appeals of Wisconsin. \nSTATE of Wisconsin EX REL. Berrell FREEMAN, Petitioner-Appellant, \nv. \nGerald BERGE, Respondent-Respondent. \nNo. 03-0802. | July 24, 2003. \nAppeal from an order of the circuit court for Dane County: Diane M. Nicks, Judge. Affirmed. \nBefore VERGERONT, P.J., DYKMAN and DEININGER, JJ. \nOpinion \nPER CURIAM. \n \n*1 Berrell Freeman appeals from an order dismissing his certiorari review action. The trial court concluded that the action \nwas rendered moot by subsequent events. We agree, and therefore affirm. \n  \n¶ 2 While incarcerated at Whiteville Correctional Facility in Tennessee, Freeman was charged with a major disciplinary \ninfraction for his role in a violent prison riot that occurred in November 1999. He was found guilty in a disciplinary \nproceeding at the facility on December 9, 1999, and transferred to the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility (WSPF) (formerly \nSupermax Correctional Institution) in April 2000. Relying on the Whiteville disciplinary findings, the Department of \nCorrections administrative confinement review committee (ACRC) ordered his placement in administrative confinement. \n  \n¶ 3 After seeking various administrative remedies Freeman commenced this action by filing a petition for writ of habeas \ncorpus, in which he challenged the Whiteville disciplinary decision, the decision transferring him to WSPF and the decision \nto place him in administrative confinement. The trial court construed the petition as one seeking certiorari review of the three \nadministrative decisions, and dismissed it because Freeman did not exhaust his administrative remedies before filing it. \nFreeman appealed, and on review we reversed in part and remanded to allow Freeman to proceed on his challenge to the \nACRC decision of April 2000. State ex rel. Freeman v. Berge, 2002 WI App 213, ¶ 1, 257 Wis.2d 236, 651 N.W.2d 881. \n  \n¶ 4 Meanwhile, other inmates had successfully challenged administrative confinements also imposed because of their \nparticipation in the Whiteville riot, on the grounds that the subsequent Whiteville disciplinary proceedings were procedurally \ninvalid. See State ex rel. Curtis v. Litscher, 2002 WI App 172, 256 Wis.2d 787, 650 N.W.2d 43. In such cases, this court \nheld that the DOC could impose administrative confinement based on the Whiteville riot participation only to the extent that \nit proved the inmate’s participation without relying on findings of the Whiteville disciplinary proceedings. Id. at ¶ 1. \n  \n¶ 5 Consequently, the DOC vacated Freeman’s administrative confinement decision of April 2000, and conducted an \nindependent investigation of his conduct during the riot. After that investigation revealed Freeman’s significant participation \nin the riot, the ACRC again placed him in administrative confinement. \n  \n¶ 6 Because Freeman was confined due to subsequent proceedings, and the April 2000 decision no longer affected his status, \nthe trial court declared his action moot. This appeal concerns that determination. \n  \n¶ 7 The trial court properly dismissed this proceeding as moot. An action is moot when its resolution will have no practical \neffect on the parties. See State ex rel. Olson v. Litscher, 2000 WI App 61, ¶ 3, 233 Wis.2d 685, 608 N.W.2d 425. At this \npoint, the proceeding concerns a voided decision that has no bearing on Freeman’s present status. It is moot. \n  1 \n \n\nState ex rel. Freeman v. Berge, 266 Wis.2d 1063 (2003)   \n \n  \n¶ 8 Freeman nevertheless contends that we should reverse and allow him to proceed on a challenge to the subsequent ACRC \ndecision continuing his administrative confinement. He contends that the petition should be converted back into one seeking \nhabeas corpus relief in order to accomplish this. However, habeas corpus relief is not available if other remedies are. State ex \nrel. Dowe v. Waukesha County Cir. Court, 184 Wis.2d 724, 729, 516 N.W.2d 714 (1994). Freeman’s other remedies, after \nthe subsequent, independent determination of the ACRC, were to pursue his administrative remedies and, if still aggrieved, to \ninitiate certiorari review. He cannot skip over those steps and bootstrap review of the subsequent, independent proceedings \ninto this action, regardless how the petition is labeled. \n  \n*2 By the Court.-Order affirmed. \n  \nThis opinion will not be published.
