    "summary": "<p>On June 5, 2005, attorneys with the Legal Aid Justice Center, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Virginia Justice Center for Farm and Immigrant Workers filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of a group of over 1500 migrant workers in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against their former employer, Eller and Sons Trees, Inc. Plaintiffs, who were from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, were admitted to the U.S. under the H-2B temporary farm worker program. The plaintiffs alleged that they planted trees and performed other forestry related work for the defendant, but that the defendant took advantage of them by grossly underpaying them in violation of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The case was assigned to Judge Clarence Cooper.</p><p>The District Court granted class certification on September 28, 2006. <i>Leon-Granados v. Eller and Sons Trees, Inc.</i>, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73781 (N.D. Ga.  Sept. 28, 2006). That same day, Judge Cooper issued a discovery order and held that the applicable statute of limitations for the AWPA claims was six years. <i>Leon-Granados v. Eller and Sons Trees, Inc.</i>, 452 F.Supp.2d 1282 (N.D. Ga. 2006). Defendants appealed the class certification order. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the order granting class certification.  <i>De Leon-Granados v. Eller and Sons Trees</i>, Inc. 2007 WL 2456206 (11th Cir.  Aug. 31, 2007).</p><p>While the case was on appeal, discovery continued, as the District Court refused defendants' request to stay the case proceedings. On November 15, 2007, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on one of their multiple claims under FLSA--their claim for reimbursement of passport, visa and travel expenses incurred in coming to work for Defendants--as well as on their claim of non-compliance with the AWPA. On October 7, 2008, the court granted Plaintiffs' partial summary judgment motion for the FLSA claim. <i>De Leon-Granados v. Eller & Sons Trees, Inc.</i>, 581 F. Supp. 2d 1295, 1313 (N.D. Ga. 2008). The court found that Eller and Sons failed to reimburse their guest workers for travel and visa expenses incurred when they came to the United States to work for the company, failed to provide them all the hours of work they were promised in their H-2B work contracts, and failed to maintain accurate records of the hours they worked. Plaintiffs were awarded $57,001.28 in damages (after court granted plaintiffs' motion to correct summary judgment order). However, the Court was unable to rule on the AWPA claim. The defendants had moved to strike the plaintiffs' expert witness, a veteran wage and hour investigator who had reviewed the defendants' records. Without that testimony, the Court could not rule on the AWPA claim, so it would have to wait until the motion was resolved.</p><p>On October 30, 2008, the defendants withdrew their motion to strike the plaintiffs' expert witness. They then moved for an interlocutory appeal on November 4, 2008.</p><p>The interlocutory appeal was fought over until September 14, 2009 when the Court denied the appeal because (1) it \"would not materially advance the ultimate termination of this litigation,\" and (2) final judgment would likely follow a damages hearing, and the defendants could just appeal then. 2009 WL 10696537. In the same order, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgement on the AWPA claim, holding that the defendants' payroll had failed to meet the AWPA requirements. It found that, following testimony by the plaintiffs' expert witness, there was no genuine issue of material fact that the defendants had kept inaccurate records and were sometimes intentionally underreporting workers' hours to evade wage payment obligations.</p><p>The plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint on July 22, 2010, clarifying requested damages. They then moved for statutory damages on August 6, 2010.</p><p>The defendant filed for bankruptcy on September 23, 2010, but the Court ordered on November 4, 2010 that litigation would proceed anyway. The parties proceeded with negotiations in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana until June 4, 2012 when that court issued an order that the parties had come to a settlement agreement.</p><p>Back in the district court, on September 28, 2012, Judge Cooper granted the plaintiffs' motion for statutory damages pursuant to the AWPA claim. Finding that the defendants were clearly aware of the requirements but willfully ignored them, that these were far more than \"mere technical violations,\" and that each class member would be receiving only a small amount, he awarded statutory damages to the plaintiff class near to the maximum allowable: $499,858.74. 2012 WL 13065433. On October 29, 2012, he then issued a final judgment for the plaintiffs, granting full damages in excess of $11 million.</p>",

Knoepp, Legal Justice Ctr., Charlottesville, VA, Andrew Hess Turner, Mary C. Bauer, Southern Poverty\nLaw Ctr., Montgomery, AL, George Brian Spears, Law Office of Brian Spears, Atlanta, GA, for Plaintiffs-\nAppellees.\n[*]\nBefore DUBINA and BLACK, Circuit Judges, and RESTANI,  Judge.\nBLACK, Circuit Judge:\nThis is an interlocutory appeal from the district court's grant of class certification. The Appellees, migrant workers,\nclaim Eller & Sons Trees, Inc. (Eller & Sons) and Jerry Eller (collectively, the Appellants) violated their rights\nunder the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1872 (AWPA) and the Fair\nLabor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-219 (FLSA), during their employment at Eller & Sons at various times\nfrom June 1999 through June 2005. On appeal, the Appellants contend the district court abused its discretion in\ncertifying, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3), the Appellees' proposed class consisting of over 1,500 migrant workers\nadmitted to the United States under the H-2B temporary foreign worker visa program to work at Eller & Sons, see\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), and sub-class consisting of those workers who pledged collateral with Eller &\nSons' agents in order to obtain employment. We hold the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the\nRule 23(b)(3) class and sub-class. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's certification order and remand for\nfurther proceedings.\nI. BACKGROUND\nEller & Sons is a small business in Franklin, Georgia, that provides reforestation and forestry services. Most of\n1217 Eller & Sons' employees plant trees in the *1217 southern United States during December, January, and\nFebruary. Employees are recruited from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico and hired under the H2-B non-\nimmigrant visa program, which permits employers to hire foreign workers to come to the United States and\nperform temporary non-agricultural services on a one-time, seasonal, peakload or intermittent basis when\nqualified U.S. workers are not available. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b). Employers of H-2B guestworkers are\nrequired to pay them an hourly prevailing wage rate, which is determined by the State Workforce Agency (SWA)\nhaving jurisdiction over the proposed area of intended employment. The workers allege the average wage rate at\nwhich Eller & Sons was certified to pay the H-2B workers was $8.32/hour, well above the $5.15/ hour federal\nminimum wage rate.\nThe appellee-migrant workers were employed by Eller & Sons at various times from June 1999 through June\n2005. On June 6, 2005, the workers filed suit on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against\nEller & Sons and Jerry Eller, asserting claims under the AWPA and FLSA. They filed an Amended Complaint\n(Complaint) on February 7, 2006. In Count I of the Complaint, the workers alleged Eller & Sons violated the\nAWPA by (1) failing to reimburse travel, recruitment and visa processing expenses, (2) maintaining and providing\nfalse and inaccurate records of hours worked, (3) failing to pay them the applicable prevailing wage rate and\n\novertime wages, (4) failing to provide them with promised full-time employment, (5) knowingly providing them with\nfalse and misleading information regarding the terms and existence of employment, and (6) requiring a sub-class\nof workers to post collateral in the form of the deeds to their property to obtain employment. In Count II of their\nComplaint, the workers alleged Eller & Sons violated the FLSA by failing to pay them the applicable minimum\nwage of $5.15/hour and overtime wages for hours worked.\nThe workers initially moved for class certification of their AWPA claims on June 29, 2005. On July 27, 2005, they\nfiled a motion for preliminary certification of a collective action for their claims under the FLSA. On October 18,\n2005, the district court issued an order denying the motion for class certification of the AWPA claims without\nprejudice and instructing the parties to conduct additional discovery on issues pertaining to class certification. In\nthe same order, the court granted preliminary certification of a collective action under 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) for the\nFLSA claims. According to the Appellants, opt-in notices for the FLSA collective action were sent to approximately\n1,800 current and former employees of Eller & Sons. Only 30 of the potential class members, in addition to the 5\nnamed plaintiffs, completed and returned their opt-in forms before the time period closed.\nOn January 31, 2006, the workers filed a renewed motion for class certification under Fed. R. Civ P. 23(b)(3) for\nthe AWPA claims, seeking to represent a class consisting of \"all those individuals admitted as H-2B temporary\nforeign workers pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), who were employed in [Eller & Sons'] forestry\noperations from June 1999 until the present.\" They also proposed a sub-class of \"all those individuals admitted\nas H-2B temporary foreign workers pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), who were employed in [Eller &\nSons'] forestry operations from January 1, 2003 until the present, who pledged collateral with [Eller & Sons']\nagents in order to obtain employment with the [Eller & Sons].\"\nOn September 28, 2006, the district court granted the motion to certify under Fed. R. Civ P. 23(b)(3). The court\n1218 rejected the Appellants' argument that a 29 *1218 U.S.C. § 216(b) collective action would be a superior method\nof adjudicating the workers' AWPA claims, finding that a § 216(b) collective action would not adequately address\nthe workers' AWPA claims. The district court also found the workers satisfied their burden to establish the\nexistence of the Rule 23 prerequisites. The Appellants filed a timely appeal, asking us to determine whether the\n[1]\ndistrict court abused its discretion in granting class certification.\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\"Questions concerning class certification are left to the sound discretion of the district court.\" Cooper v. Southern\nCo., 390 F.3d 695, 711 (11th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we review a district court's class certification order for abuse\nof discretion. Heffner v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ala., Inc., 443 F.3d 1330, 1337 (11th Cir. 2006).\nIII. DISCUSSION\nOn appeal, the Appellants argue the district court abused its discretion in granting class certification. The\nAppellants claim this action is based on the FLSA and must therefore be adjudicated as an opt-in collective action\nunder 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) instead of an opt-out Rule 23(b)(3) class action. Alternatively, the Appellants argue that\neven if a Rule 23 class action is not precluded by 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), the district court abused its discretion in\ncertifying the class because the workers failed to prove the necessary prerequisites under Rule 23. We address\nthe Appellants' arguments in Sections A. and B., respectively.\nA. Impact of 29 U.S.C. § 216(b)\nThe Appellants maintain that the bulk of the purported AWPA claims are derived from alleged FLSA violations and\nmust therefore be brought in a collective action. Section 216(b) of the FLSA provides that \"[n]o employee shall be\na party plaintiff to any action [for unpaid wages] unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party\n1219 and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.\"[2]*1219 Thus, in an FLSA action, a party-\nplaintiff must opt into an action, whereas in a Rule 23(b)(3) class action, all qualifying class members become\nparty-plaintiffs unless they opt out of the action. See Rule 23(c)(2)(B) (explaining that \"the court will exclude from\nthe class any member who requests exclusion\"). The Appellants contend this distinction is crucial because only\n\n35 of 1,800 potential FLSA collective action plaintiffs opted into the action. The Appellants claim that if we allow\nthe AWPA claims to proceed as a Rule 23(b)(3) class action, the class could potentially consist of 6,000 plus\n[3]\nworkers.\nWe must first examine whether the workers' AWPA claims are truly FLSA claims in disguise, as the Appellants\nallege. The FLSA creates a private right of action for aggrieved employees to recover unpaid minimum wages\nand unpaid overtime wages. 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). A review of Count I of the Complaint shows that the workers\nasserted six AWPA claims, of which only two seek unpaid wages. Those claims assert that the Appellants violated\nthe AWPA by (1) failing to pay them the proper prevailing wage rate and overtime wages for all work performed\nand (2) failing to reimburse them for expenses they incurred which were primarily for Eller & Sons' benefit,\nincluding travel and visa processing expenses. The workers separately pled FLSA claims under Count II of the\nComplaint. Those claims assert that the Appellants violated the FLSA by failing to pay them the applicable\nminimum wage rate of $5.15/hour and overtimes wages for all hours worked.\nAlthough both the AWPA claims and FLSA claims seek unpaid wages, they are not identical. The workers are\nentitled to recover the prevailing wage rate under the AWPA and only the minimum wage rate under the FLSA.\nThus, the workers' AWPA wage claims are not FLSA claims in disguise and may properly be brought in a Rule 23\n(b)(3) class action. Likewise, the workers' AWPA claims that do not seek unpaid wages00including claims based\n97\non the failure to make, keep and provide accurate work records, the failure to provide workers with promised full-\ntime employment, knowingly providing them with false and misleading information regarding the terms and\nexistence of employment, and wrongfully requiring them to post deeds to their land as collateral to obtain\nemployment00cannot be asserted under the FLSA, and are also appropriate for an AWPA class action under Rule\n97\n23.\nThe statutory text of the AWPA supports our conclusion that the workers are entitled to bring their AWPA claims\nas a Rule 23 class action. Its private right of action provision provides that \"if [a] complaint is certified as a class\naction, the court shall award no more than the lesser of up to $500 per plaintiff per violation, or up to $ 500,000 or\nother equitable relief.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1854(c)(1)(B). This contemplates that an action based on violations of the\nAWPA may be certified as a class action. Moreover, where Congress intended an external statute to provide the\nexclusive remedy for conduct that violates the AWPA, it expressly said so and limited the AWPA accordingly. For\nexample, section 1854(d) provides that \"where a State workers' compensation law is applicable and coverage is\nprovided for a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker, the workers' compensation benefits shall be the exclusive\nremedy for loss of such worker under this Chapter in the case of bodily injury or death in accordance with such\n1220 State's workers' compensation law.\" 29 U.S.C. *1220 § 1854(d). If Congress intended § 216(b) to be the\nexclusive remedy for violations of the AWPA's wage payment provisions, it would have also said so. Accordingly,\nthe district court did not err in finding the AWPA claims cognizable for class action treatment.\nB. Rule 23 Class Certification\nThe Appellants argue that even if a Rule 23 action is not precluded by 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), the district court\nabused its discretion in granting class certification because the Rule 23 requirements were not met. A party\nseeking to maintain a class action bears the burden of demonstrating that class certification is proper. Rutstein v.\nAvis Rent-A-Car Sys., 211 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2000). Here, the migrant workers sought to be certified as a\nRule 23(b)(3) class action. To be certified under Rule 23(b)(3), a party must first show the following:\n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of\nlaw or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); see also Piazza v. Ebsco Indus., Inc., 273 F.3d 1341, 1346 (11th Cir.2001). \"These four\nrequirements commonly are referred to as the prerequisites of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy\nof representation, and they are designed to limit class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiffs'\nindividual claims.\" Piazza, 273 F.3d at 1346 (internal quotations omitted). Additionally, the party must show that\n\"questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\n\nadjudication of the controversy.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3); see also Rutstein, 211 F.3d at 1233. In making these\ndeterminations, a court is to consider the interest of class members in individually controlling separate actions,\nthe extent and nature of litigation concerning the controversy already commenced, the desirability of maintaining\nthe litigation in the particular forum, and the difficulties to be encountered in the managing the class action.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).\nThe Appellants argue the district court erred in granting class certification because (1) the Rule 23(a)\nprerequisites of numerosity and adequacy of representation did not exist, and (2) a class action is not the\nsuperior method for adjudication of the controversy. As a preliminary matter, we note that the Appellants did not\nargue before the district court that numerosity was lacking. The Appellants have, therefore, waived that argument.\nSee, e.g., Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 598 (11th Cir.1995). The Appellants did,\nhowever, challenge the adequacy of representation before the district court, and we therefore address that\nargument.\nThe Appellants argue the class representatives are not suitable because they invoked the Fifth Amendment\nduring their depositions when asked if they worked for other employers in the United States. The Appellants claim\nthe negative inferences that can be drawn from the invocation of the Fifth Amendment make the named plaintiffs\nunsuitable class representatives. In its order granting certification, the district court acknowledged this issue, but\nconcluded it would revisit the issue after its relevance was resolved. The court committed to continually examine\nthe adequacy of representation of the class representatives. Keeping in mind that \"questions concerning class\n1221 certification are left to the sound discretion of the *1221 district court,\" the district court's commitment convinces\nus that the district court will re-examine the issue throughout the proceedings and will assure class representation\nis adequate. Cooper, 390 F.3d at 711. Accordingly, at this stage in the proceedings, we conclude the court did not\nabuse its discretion in finding adequacy of representation.\nLastly, the Appellants argue a class action is not the superior method of adjudicating the workers' AWPA claims\nbecause a highly individualized assessment of the facts will be necessary to determine the amount of hours each\nemployee worked compared to the amount recorded. We recognize this is a valid concern, but nonetheless\nconclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting class certification. We note that under the\nAWPA, aggrieved workers are entitled to recover either actual damages or statutory damages of up to $500 per\nplaintiff. 29 U.S.C. § 1854(c). While it is not clear from the complaint whether the workers seek actual or statutory\ndamages, it is within the district court's discretion to award statutory damages where proof of actual damages is\nscarce. See id. The award of statutory damages would eliminate the need to determine individualized damages\nbased on actual hours worked.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying a Rule 23(b)(3) class to adjudicate the workers' AWPA\nclaims. The Appellants failed to prove the AWPA claims were required to be brought as an FLSA collective action.\nMoreover, given the district court's commitment to continually monitor the appropriateness of a class action, the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Rule 23 pre-requisites were met. Accordingly, we affirm\nthe district court's certification order.\nAFFIRMED.\n[*] Honorable Jane A. Restani, Chief Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.\n[1] The same day it issued the class certification order, the district court issued a discovery order in which it held\nthat the applicable statute of limitations for the AWPA claims is six years. The Appellants also argue on appeal the\ndistrict court erred in establishing this statute of limitations. This issue is not properly before us, however. With\nlimited exceptions, the federal courts of appeals have jurisdiction to hear appeals only \"from . . . final decisions of\nthe district courts of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (emphasis added). Although Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(f) permits\nus to review \"an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification,\" the district court's finding\non the applicable statute of limitations was made in a separate discovery order. The jurisdiction granted by Rule\n\n23(f) does not extend to this separate order. Further, the Appellants have not argued any other exception to our\nlimited review of interlocutory orders. Thus, we do not have jurisdiction to consider the statute of limitations issue.\n[2]See also 29 C.F.R. § 790.20. That regulation provides: \nSection 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended by section 5 of the Portal Act, no longer permits an\nemployee or employees to designate an agent or representative (other than a member of the affected group) to\nmaintain, an action for and in behalf of all employees similarly situated. Collective actions brought by an\nemployee or employees (a real party in interest) for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees\nsimilarly situated may still be brought in accordance with the provisions of section 16(b). With respect to these\nactions, the amendment provides that no employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives\nhis consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is\nbrought.\n[3] It is unclear how the Appellants came up with a total of 6,000 potential class members. The Complaint alleges\nthe class is believed to include over 1,500 individuals.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This action is brought by migrant agricultural  workers who were \nadmitted to the United States to work under the H-2B temporary foreign worker visa \nprogram.  The Plaintiffs have been employed in the forestry operations of the \nDefendants at various times during the period from June 1999 through the filing of \n- ---._---\nthis Complaint.  The Plaintiffs seek redress on behalf of themselves and all others \n-1-\n\nsimilarly situated for the Defendants' violations of their rights under the Migrant and \nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1871 (1999) \n(\"AW  PA\") and the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-219 (1998) \n(\"FLSA\"). \n2.  This action is brought on behalf of a class of over 1500 \npredominantly Guatemalan, Mexican and Honduran migrant workers who planted \ntrees and performed other forestry-related activities for the Defendants.  The Plaintiffs \nand other class members are indigent migrant workers who the Defendants brought to \nthe United States on temporary, H-2B work visas.  The Plaintiffs and other class \nmembers left their homes and families and spent considerable money and effort to . \ncome to the United States to perform arduous jobs, which the Defendants have \ncertified that American workers were not willing to do. \n3.  Almost all of the Plaintiffs and other class members are non-English \nspeakers who had little, if any, understanding of their legal rights while working in the \nUnited States as H-2B forestry workers - particularly their legal rights to receive a \nprevailing hourly wage and overtime pay.  The Defendants took full advantage of the \nPlaintiffs' and other class members' indigence, inability to speak or understand \nEnglish, and their lack of understanding of the laws of the United States to grossly \nunderpay them. \n-2-\n\n4.  The Plaintiffs and many other class members were required by \nDefendants' agents to leave the deeds to their homes or land in Guatemala with the \nd~fendants' agents in order to obtain employment with the Defendants.  These \nPlaintiffs and other class members were thus particularly vulnerable to coercion and \nexploitation by the Defendants, as they believed they might lose their property if they \nfailed to comply with the directives of the Defendants. \n5.  The Plaintiffs seek an award of unpaid wages, an award of money \ndamages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief to make them whole for damages \nthey suffered due to the Defendants' violations of law and to ensure that they and \nother H-2B workers will not be subjected by the Defendants to such illegal conduct in \nthe future. \nJURISDICTION \n6.  Jurisdiction is conferred upon this court by 28 U.S.C. § 1331, this case \narising under the laws of the United States,  28 U.S.C. § 1337, this action arising \nunder Acts of Congress regulating commerce, 29 U.S.C. § 1854(a), this action arising \nunder the A WPA, and 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), this action arising under the FLSA. \n7.  The Court is empowered to issue a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n----~--- -\nVENUE \n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (c) \n-3-\n\nand 29 U.S.C. § 1854(a). \nPARTIES \n9.

At all times relevant to this action, the Plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers were migrant agricultural workers within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § \n1802(8)(A), in that they were employed in agricultural employment of a seasonal \nnature and were required to be absent overnight from their permanent places of \nresidence. \n11.  Substantial agricultural work was performed by the Plaintiffs and other \nclass members for the Defendants in this state and within this District. \n12.

Defendant Jerry Eller is an individual resident of Montana who conducted \nsignificant business in this District.  Defendant Jerry Eller had significant contacts \nwith the state of Georgia and this District such that jurisdiction and venue are proper \nin this Court. \n20.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendant Jerry Eller employed the \nPlaintiffs and the other class members within the meaning of29 U.S.C. § 1802(5) and \n29 U.S.C. § 203(g). \n---.. _-------\n-5-\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n21.  The Defendants operate a tree-planting service, in which they bid on and \nnegotiate contracts to plant trees on land owned by other individuals and companies. \nTo fill the manpower requirements of their contracts, the Defendants sought \nimportation of foreign nationals to perform forestry work on a seasonal or temporary \nbasis, in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b). \n22.  The Plaintiffs and the other members of the class were \nadmitted to the United States to be employed as members of labor crews organized by \nthe Defendants.  Each of the Plaintiffs and the other class members was issued a \ntemporary visa, commonly referred to as an \"H-2B visa,\" as authorized by 8 U.S.C. § \n11 0 1(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), its attendant regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(6), 20 C.F.R. § \n655.3, and administrative letters and/or guidance.  The Plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers were admitted to the United States and were employed by the Defendants. \n23.  The Plaintiffs and other class members spent considerable sums of \nmoney to process their H -2B work visas and travel from their home villages to the \nUnited States.  These costs were incurred by the Plaintiffs and other class members for \nthe primary benefit of their Defendant employers. \n24.  In addition, as a condition of being hired, the Plaintiffs and many other \nclass members were required to leave collateral, in the form of the deed to their land, \n-6-\n\nwith the Defendants' agents in Guatemala.  The Plaintiffs and other class members \nwere required to leave this deed with Defendants' agents so that the Defendants could \nbe assured that the workers would remain under the control of and in the employ of \nthe Defendants.  The requirement that Plaintiffs leav~ their deeds had an extremely \ncoercive effect upon the Plaintiffs and other class members.  The Defendants have not \nreturned these documents to Plaintiff Armenio Pablo-Calmo, nor to many other class \nmembers. \n25.  The Defendants' actions as described in paragraph 24 constituted forced \nlabor and/or trafficking into servitude as defined by the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act, contravening the policies and purposes of that Act.  Those \nactions were also violative of the A WP A working arrangement between the parties, \nwhich incorporates applicable law. \n26.  As a condition of obtaining H-2B visas for the Plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers, the Defendants certified to the United States Department of Labor that, inter \nalia, the wages paid the Plaintiffs and other class members would equal or exceed the \napplicable prevailing wage, that the jobs offered would be full-time jobs of 40 hours \nper week, and that the job would not contravene Federal, State, or local law, including \napplicable requirements of the H-2B program, as set out in Department of Labor \nregulations and administrative interpretations. \n-7-\n\n27.  When the Defendants provided information to the Plaintiffs regarding \nwork hours and manner of compensation, the information provided was false and \nmisleading. \n28.  The Defendants did not issue accurate and 'complete records regarding \nthe employment of the Plaintiffs and other class members.  The records the \nDefendants kept of the Plaintiffs' work were inadequate, inaccurate, false and \nmisleading. \n29.  The Plaintiffs and other class members performed arduous tree planting and \nassociated forestry work for the Defendants in Georgia and other states.  They \nregularly worked far in excess of 40 hours in a given workweek. \n30.  The Defendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the \nother members of the class the minimum wage for all the work they performed. \n31.  The Defendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nclass the proper prevailing wage for all the work they performed. \n32.  The Defendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nclass overtime wages for all work they performed in excess of forty (40) hours in a \ngiven workweek. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n33.  All claims set forth in Count I are brought by the Plaintiffs on behalf of \nthemselves and all other similarly situated persons pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the \n-8-\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n34.  The named Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all those \nindividuals admitted as H-2B temporary foreign workers pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), who were employed in the Defendants' forestry operations \nfrom June 1999 until the present. \n35.  Plaintiff Armenio Pablo-Calmo seeks to represent a subclass consisting \ni  . \nof all those individuals admitted as H-2B temporary foreign workers pursuant to 8 \nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), who were employed in the Defendants' forestry \noperations from January 1, 2003 until the present, who pledged  collateral with the \nDefendants' agents in order to obtain employment with the Defendants. \n36.  The precise number of individuals in the class is known \nonly to the Defendants.  The class is believed to include well over 2000 individuals. \nThe class is comprised principally of indigent migrant farmworkers who maintain \ntheir residences in locations throughout Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras.  The class \nmembers are not fluent in the English language.  Indeed, many of the class members \nspeak indigenous Mayan languages as their primary language, and speak Spanish as a \nsecond language, with varying degrees of proficiency. The relatively small size of the \nindividual claims, the geographical dispersion of the class, and the indigency of the \nclass members makes the maintenance of separate actions by each class member \n-9-\n\neconomically infeasible.  Joinder of all class members is impracticable. \n37.  There are questions of fact and law common to the class.  These common \nquestions include whether the Defendants failed to pay the named Plaintiffs and other \nclass members prevailing and overtime wages promptly when due, as required by law \nand their employment contracts; whether Defendants failed to maintain complete and \naccurate records regarding the Plaintiffs' and the class members' work; whether the \nDefendants failed to provide the Plaintiffs and the class members with complete and \naccurate wage statements; whether the failure of the Defendants to pay the Plaintiffs \nand the class members the prevailing wage and overtime pay as required by the H-2B \ntemporary foreign labor program violated the A WPA's wage payment and working \narrangement provisions; whether the Defendants' failure to pay the class members for \nat least 40 hours of work each week violated the A WP A's wage payment and working \narrangement provisions; whether the Defendants' requirements that the Plaintiffs and \nsome of the class members leave the deed to their land violated th~ A WP A; and \nwhether the Defendants' failure to maintain complete and accurate records regarding \nthe work of the Plaintiffs and the class members, and Defendants' failure to provide \nthe named Plaintiffs and the class members with complete and accurate wage \nstatements, were violations of the A WP A. \n38.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the \n-10-\n\nclass, and these typical, common claims predominate over any questions affecting \nonly individual class members.  The named Plaintiffs have the same interests as do the \nother members of the class and will vigorously prosecute these interests on behalf of \nthe class. \n39.  Counsel for the Plaintiffs have handled numerous A WP A and FLSA \nactions in the federal courts.  They are prepared to advance litigation costs necessary \nto vigorously litigate this action. \n40. A class action under Rule 23(b )(3) is superior to other \navailable methods of adjudicating this controversy because, inter alia: \n•  The common issues of law and fact, as well as the relatively small size \nof the individual class members' claims, substantially diminish the \ninterest of members of the class in individually controlling the \nprosecution of separate actions; \n• . Many members of the class are unaware of their rights to prosecute \nthese claims and lack the means or resources to secure legal \nassistance; \n•  There has been no litigation already commenced against the \nDefendants by the members of the class to determine the questions \npresented; \n-11-\n\n•  It is desirable that the claims be heard in this forum since the \nDefendants have significant contacts with this District; and \n•  A class action can be managed without undue difficulty since the \nDefendants have regularly committed the violations complained of \nherein, and are required to maintain detailed records concerning each \nmember of the class. \nCOUNT I \nMIGRANT AND SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL \nWORKER PROTECTION ACT \n(CLASS ACTION) \n41. This count sets forth a claim by the Plaintiffs and the \nother members of the class for money damages, declaratory relief and injunctive relief, \nwith respect to the Defendants' violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural \nWorker Protection Act (\"A WP A\"). \n42.  The Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth \nin paragraphs 1 through 39 above. \n43. The certifications described in paragraph 26 above constituted a working \n-~---.-.. ----\narrangement between the Defendants and the Plaintiffs and other class members \n-12-\n\nwithin the meaning of the A WPA, 29 U.S.C. § 1822(c), and its attendant regulations, \n29 C.F.R. § 500.72. \n44.  The Defendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the \nother members of the class the proper prevailing wage for all the work they \nperformed, and failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the other members of the class overtime \nwages for all compensable time they were employed in excess of forty (40) hours in a \ngiven workweek. \n45.  The violation of the A WP A as set out in paragraph 44 \nresulted in part from the Defendants' failure to supplement the piece-rate earnings of \nthe Plaintiffs and the other class members so as to raise their individual pay period \nwages to a rate equal to or exceeding the prevailing and overtime wage. \n46.  The violation of the A WPA as set out in paragraph 44 resulted in part \nfrom the Defendants' maintenance of incomplete, false and inaccurate records of the \nhours worked by Plaintiffs and other class members. \n47.  The violation of the A WP A as set out in paragraph 44, 45 and 46 \nresulted in part from the Defendants' failure to reimburse the Plaintiffs and the other \nmembers of the class for expenses they incurred which were primarily for the benefit \nof the Defendants, as well as the Defendants' unlawful withholdings and deductions \nfrom the wages of the Plaintiffs and'the other class members. \n-13-\n\n48. The Defendants, who were obligated to offer full time employment to the \nPlaintiffs and other class members, consistently failed to pay workers for at least 40 \nhours of work each week. \n49.  By their actions as described in paragraphs 44, 45, 46, 47,and 48,  the \nDefendants violated without justification their working arrangement with the Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the class, thereby violating the A WPA, 29 U.S.C. § 1822(c), \nand its attendant regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 500.72. \n50.  By their actions as described in paragraphs 44 45, 46, 47 and 48 the \n./ \nDefendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and other members of the class their wages \nowed promptly when due, thereby violating the A WPA, 29 U.S.C. § 1822(a), and its \nattendant regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 500.81. \n51.  The Defendants knowingly provided false and misleading information to \nthe Plaintiffs and other class members, regarding the terms and conditions of their \nemployment, in violation of the A WPA 29 U.S.C. § 1821(f); 29 C.F.R. § 500.77. \n52.  The Defendants failed to make, keep, and preserve \naccurate and complete records regarding the Plaintiffs' and the other class members' \nemployment, in violation of the A WPA, 29 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(1), and its attendant \nregulations, 29 C.F.R. § 500.80(a). \n53.  The Defendants failed to provide the Plaintiffs and the \n-14-\n\nother class members complete and accurate itemized written statements for each pay \nperiod containing the required information, in violation of the A WPA, 29 U.S.C. § \n1821(d)(2), and its attendant regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 500.80(d). \n54.  By their actions as described in paragraphs 23, 24 and 25 above, the \nDefendants violated without justification their working arrangement with the Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the class, thereby violating the A WPA, 29 U.S.C. § 1822(c), \nand its attendant regulations, 29 C.F .R. § 500.72. \n55. The requirement that Plaintiffs and other class members sign over collateral \nin order to obtain employment with the Defendants was an agreement that purported \nto waive or modify the Plaintiffs' rights under the A WPA, in violation of29 U.S.C. § \n1856. \n56.  The violations of the A WPAand its attendant regulations as set forth in \nthis count were the natural consequences of the conscious and deliberate actions of the \nDefendants and were intentional within the meaning of the A WPA, 29 U.S.C. § \n1854( c)(1). \n57.  As a result of the Defendants' violations of the A WPA   \nand its attendant regulations as set forth in this count, the Plaintiffs and the other \nmembers of the class have suffered damages. \n--- -- ---~.---\n-15-\n\nCOUNT II \nFAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT \n(COLLECTIVE ACTION) \n58. This count sets forth a claim for declaratory relief and damages for the \nDefendants' violations of the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"). This count is brought by the Plaintiffs on behalf of \nthemselves and other current or former H-2B temporary foreign workers employed by \nthe Defendants who are similarly situated. \n59. The Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth' \nin paragraphs 1 through 32 above. \n60.  Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), Plaintiffs Escolastico De Leon-Granados, \nIsaias Profeta De' Leon-Granados and Armenio Pablo-Calmo have consented in \nwriting to be party plaintiffs in this FLSA action. Their written consents are attached \nto this complaint. \n61.  The Defendants violated 29 U.S.C. § 206(a) by failing to pay each of the \nPlaintiffs and others similarly situated the applicable minimum wage for every \ncompensable hour of labor they performed. \n62.  The Defendants violated 29 U.S.C. § 207(a) by failing \nto pay the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated at an hourly rate equal to one and a \nhalf times their regular rate of pay for all compensable time they were employed in \n-16-\n\nexcess of forty (40) hours in each workweek. \n63.  The violations of the FLSA set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 resulted in part \nfrom the Defendants' failure to supplement the piece-rate earnings of the Plaintiffs \nand others similarly situated so as to raise their individual wages each workweek to a \nrate equal to or exceeding the minimum and overtime wage. \n64.  The violations of the FLSA set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 resulted, in \npart, from the Defendants' maintenance of incomplete, false and inaccurate records of \nthe hours worked by Plaintiffs and others similarly situated. \n65.  The violations of the FLSA set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 resulted, in \npart, from the Defendants' failure to reimburse the Plaintiffs and others similarly \nsituated for expenses they incurred which were primarily for the benefit of the \nDefendants. \n66.  The violations of the FLSA set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 resulted, in \npart, from the Defendants' unlawful withholdings and deductions from the wages of \nthe Plaintiffs and others similarly situated. \n67.  The Defendants' failures to pay the Plaintiffs and \nothers similarly situated their federally mandated minimum wages, and their federally \nmandated overtime wages for all time they were employed in excess of forty (40) \n~------ ----~ \nhours in a workweek, were willful violations of the FLSA within the meaning of 29 \n-17-\n\nU.S.C. § 255(a). \n68.  As a consequence of the Defendants' violation of the \nFLSA, the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated are entitled to recover their unpaid \nminimum and overtime wages, plus an additional equal amount in liquidated damages, \ncosts of suit, and reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs pray that this Court will enter an order: \n1.

(hereinafter referred to as \"Ellen and\nSons\" or \"Ellen and Sons Trees\") and Jerry Ellen. Ellen and Sons Trees is a\nbusiness located in Franklin, Georgia, that provides reforestation (tree\nplanting) and other forestry services such as brush clearing, boundary\nmarking, and chemical spraying . Most of its employees are engaged in tree\nplanting, predominantly in the southern United States during the months of\nDecember, January, and February. This is arduous work, and Ellen and Sons\nTrees cannot find enough employees in the United States to perform the\nwork. As a result, most of the workers come from outside of the United\nStates. The vast majority come from Guatemala, although some come from\nMexico, Honduras, and Colombia. Ellen and Sons Trees obtains\nemployees through the H-2B visa program, which allows the legal,\ntemporary or seasonal employment of alien, nonimmigrant employees . Jerry\nEllen is the president, sole corporate officer, and owner of Ellen and Sons\nTrees.\nThe named Plaintiffs are three migrant farmworkers who were\nemployed in Defendants' forestry operations at various times since June 1,\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 366   Filed 09/29/09   Page 3 of 14\n1999.

[Doc. No.\n43]. On September 28, 2006, the Court certified the Plaintiffs' Count I\nAWPA claims as a Rule 23(b)(3) class action. [Doc. No. 100] . The\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this Court's certification of the\nPlaintiffs' AWPA claims for Rule 23 class action treatment on August 31,\n2007. DeLeon-Granados v. Ellen & Sons Trees, Inc., 497 F.3d 1214 (11th\nCir. 2007).\nOn November 15, 2007, the parties filed cross motions for summary\njudgment on various issues, many of which the Court decided in its October\n8, 2008 Order. De Leon-Granados v. Ellen & Sons Trees, Inc., 581 F. Supp.\n2d 1295 (N.D. Ga. 2008). The Defendants have moved for certification of\nan interlocutory appeal of that Order granting and denying the parties'\nvarious motions for summary judgment. [Doc. No. 341].\n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 366   Filed 09/29/09   Page 4 of 14\nThe parties' cross motions for partial summary judgment regarding\nDefendants' compliance with AWPA recordkeeping requirements could not\nbe decided in the Court's omnibus summary judgment Order because\nDefendants' objections to the admission of the Plaintiffs' expert witness\nreport had not been resolved. De Leon-Granados, 581 F. Supp. 2d at 1322-\n23. Because no adequate showing of classwide recordkeeping violations\nwas made without reference to the report of Plaintiffs' expert witness Jorge\nRivero, the cross motions concerning Defendants' recordkeeping were\ndenied without prejudice, pending an evidentiary hearing pursuant to\nDaubert v. Merell Dow Pharms., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). The Court scheduled\na Daubert hearing [Doe. No. 338] but that hearing was cancelled when\nDefendants withdrew their objection to the admission of Plaintiffs' expert\nwitness report. [Doc. No. 341 at 1]. By Order dated October 30, 2008 the\nCourt renewed its consideration of Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary\nJudgment Finding Violations of AWPA Recordkeeping and Defendants'\ncross-motion, considering the report of Plaintiffs' expert witness as a part of\nthe record. [Doe. No. 341].\n11. Defendants' Motion for Certification of Interlocutory\nAppeal\nDefendants move the Court to certify numerous aspects of its October\nS, 2008 summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 366   Filed 09/29/09   Page 5 of 14\nU.S.C. § 1292(b). [Doc. No. 343]. Specifically, Defendants ask that the\nCourt certify for interlocutory appeal its holdings that the FLSA and the\nAWPA require reimbursement of the pre-employment travel, visa and\npassport expenses Plaintiffs bore; and that the work hours information\nsubmitted on Defendants' ETA-750 application for guestworker visas was\nincorporated into the Plaintiffs' AWPA working arrangement as an\nenforceable guarantee. De Leon-Granados, 581 F. Supp. 2d at 1308-25.\nInterlocutory review is appropriate under § 1292(b) only where the\ndistrict judge:\nshall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question\nof law, as to which there is substantial ground for difference of\nopinion and that an immediate appeal from the order will materially\nadvance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). All three conditions must be met for § 1292(b)\ncertification to issue. McFarlin v. Conseco Servs., 381 F.3d 1251, 1259\n(11th Cir. 2004).\nBecause the certification Defendants seek would not materially\nadvance the ultimate termination of this litigation, Defendants' motion is due\nto be denied. Even if the Court of Appeals were to reverse the portions of\nthe Order for which Defendants seek review, numerous significant aspects of\nthis case would remain for trial . Interlocutory review petitions fail to satisfy\n§ 1292(b)'s material advancement requirement where trial on significant\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 366   Filed 09/29/09   Page 6 of 14\nissues would be required regardless of the success or failure of the requested\nappeal. McFarlin, 381 F.3d at 1262 (\"Resolution of one claim out of seven\nwould do little if anything to `materially advance the ultimate termination of\nthe litigation.\"').\nIn the alternative, Plaintiffs have suggested that this case may be ripe\nfor entry of final judgment following a damages hearing concerning the\nclaims on which summary judgment has been granted . If so, the Defendants\nwill soon be afforded an appeal from a final judgment. In either event, an\ninterlocutory appeal from the Court's partial summary judgment order will\nnot materially advance the ultimate termination of this litigation .\nDefendants' motion is DENIED.\nIIL Motions for Partial Summary Judgment Regarding AWPA\nRecordkeeping Requirements\nAs set forth above, Defendants have moved for partial summary\njudgment seeking a determination that their payroll information meets the\nAWPA's requirements as to 29 U .S.C. § 1821(d). [Doc. Nos. 190 & 195].\nSpecifically, Defendants move for summary judgment as to the requirement\nthat the employer provide to each employee an itemized pay stub each pay\nperiod reflecting information required by 29 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(1). Plaintiffs\ncross-move for partial summary judgment that Defendants failed to make,\nkeep, and preserve accurate and complete records regarding Plaintiffs' and\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 366   Filed 09/29/09   Page 7 of 14\nother class members' employment, in violation of the AWPA and its\nattendant regulations. 29 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 500.80(a). [Doc.\nNo. 208]. For the reasons stated below, the Court denies Defendants'\nmotion and grants the Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment .\nAWPA Section 1821(d) imposes on agricultural employers and\nassociations who employ migrant workers a reasonable standard of quality\nbusiness and record keeping practices that requires them to :\n(1) with respect to each such worker, make, keep and preserve records\nfor three years of the following information :\n(A) the basis on which wages are paid ;\n(B) the number of piecework units earned, if paid on a piece\nwork basis;\n(C) the number of hours worked ;\n(D) the total pay period earnings;\n(E) the specific sums withheld and the purpose of each sum\nwithheld; and\n(F) the net pay; and\n(2) provide to each such worker for each pay period, an itemized\nwritten statement of the information required by paragraph (1) of this\nsubsection.\nSee 29 U.S.C. § 1821(d); see also 29 C.F.R. § 500.80(d). The record keeping\nprovisions \"are core protections offered by the Act,\" and all violations are\npunishable \"'to prevent minimum wage violations and other departures from\n7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 366   Filed 09/29/09   Page 8 of 14\n[the Act] [,]\"' even if the offenses are \"mere technical violations.\" Sanchez v.\nOvermyer, 891 F. Supp. 1253, 126 (N.D. Ohio 1995) (citations omitted);\nsee also Castillo v. Case Farms of Ohio, Inc., 96 F. Supp. 2d 578, 632 (W.D.\nTex. 1999) (\"The AWPA was designed not only to punish, but also prevent\nsuch behavior.\"). A party violates § 1821(d) if the records kept and\npreserved and/or statements provided to the workers are not accurate . See,\nSanchez v. Overmyer, 845 F. Supp. 1183, 1190 (N.D. Ohio 1993) (finding\non summary judgment that employer had intentionally violated the AWPA\nby, inter alia, failing to keep accurate wage records and failing to provide\nplaintiffs with accurate wage statements) ; Sanchez, 891 F. Supp. at 1255\n(summarizing the summary judgment ruling regarding the inaccuracy of the\nwage records and wage statements) .\nIn order for Plaintiffs to recover for violations of the AWPA,\nDefendants' violations must have been intentional . 29 U.S.C. § 1854{c}(1).\nIn the context of the AWPA, \"intentional\" does not require a specific intent\nto violate the law, but merely \"conscious or deliberate\" acts. Alvarez v. Joan\nof Arc, Inc., 658 F.2d 1217, 1224 (7th Cir. 1981); Maldonado v. Lucca, 636\nF. Supp. 621, 625 (D.N.J. 1986). Plaintiffs thus must establish that\nDefendants deliberately engaged in the action that led to the violation. Wales\nv. Jack M. Berry, 192 F. Supp. 2d 1269, 12$8 (M.D. Fla. 1999).\n8\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 366   Filed 09/29/09   Page 9 of 14\nIn the case at bar, Defendants provide workers with a detailed pay\ndocument on an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet. The document shows (a) the basis on\nwhich wages are paid; (b) the number of piecework units earned, if paid on a\npiecework basis; (c) the number of hours worked; (d) the total pay period\nearnings; (e) the specific sums withheld and the purpose of each sum\nwithheld; and (f) the net pay received. Defendants contend that the pay\ndocuments demonstrate compliance with the AWPA .\nPlaintiffs maintain, pointing to evidence in the record, that the payroll\ndocuments fail to show an accurate number of piecework units completed by\nEllen and Sons workers in the corresponding workweek . Plaintiffs\nspecifically point to the following errors in this regard : (1) although planting\nworkers were normally paid by the tree planted, Ellen and Sons supervisors\nestimated the number of trees that were in the seedling bundles the workers\nplanted, using educated guesses to derive piece rate totals ; (2) some\nsupervisors awarded trees workers did not actually plant to those workers'\npiece rate accounts as a form of bonus; (3) supervisors attributed trees a\nworker planted on one work day to that worker's piece rate tally for the\nfollowing work day; and (4) Ellen and Sons supervisors compensated the\nperformance of non-planting work -- properly compensable on an hourly\n9\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 366   Filed 09/29/09   Page 10 of 14\nbasis -- not by recording hours worked but by adding fictitious trees, not\nactually planted, to the piece rate totals of workers performing this work.\nPlaintiffs also maintain, pointing to evidence in the record, that the\npayroll documents fail to show an accurate number of hours worked by\nDefendants' workers. The specific errors with respect to work hours include\nthe following: (1) Eller and Sons supervisors sometimes maintained no\nrecord at all of hours worked and merely noted piece rate production ; (2)\nDefendants failed to credit their tree planting workers for compensable\npreliminary work, by declining to record work Plaintiffs did loading trees\nprior to the planting day; (3) Defendants recorded longer lunch breaks than\nthe workers actually took; (4) Defendants deducted from Plaintiffs' work\nhours time spent traveling from one work location to another, after the\ncommencement of the work day ; and (5) Defendants falsely reported\nreduced work hours for slower planters, in order to evade wage payment\nobligations.\nThere is substantial evidence in the record demonstrating that the\nviolations alleged by Plaintiffs occurred and that the violations were\n\"intentional\" within the meaning of the AWPA. Plaintiffs submit\napproximately 100 daily fieldwork records (\"daily sheets\") demonstrating\nthese violations. Plaintiffs move for entry of partial summary judgment also\n10\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 366   Filed 09/29/09   Page 11 of 14\nbased, in part, on the deposition testimony of 15 of the 16 crew leaders who\nwere deposed in the action. Some crew leaders or field supervisors did admit\nto making mistakes in record keeping, on occasion, and to taking actions that\nwould run afoul of the AWPA's record keeping provisions, such as\ncompensating workers who helped load seedlings for planting by adding\ntrees, which those workers did not actually plant, to their piece rate records\nof trees planted on the daily sheets .\nThe Court has held, however, that without reference to the report of\ntheir expert witness, Jorge J . Rivero, a veteran wage and hour investigator\nwho undertook a comprehensive review of Defendants' \"daily sheet\" field\nrecords for indicia of inaccuracy, the Plaintiffs can show only anecdotal\nviolations, and not a classwide violation of the AWPA . De Leon-Granados,\n581 F.Supp. 2d at 1323. The Court denied the parties' cross motions\nwithout prejudice, pending a Daubert admissibility determination regarding\nMr. Rivero's study. Id.\nDefendants withdrew their Motion to Strike Jorge Rivero's expert\ntestimony before the Court could hold a scheduled Daubert hearing,\nhowever, and the Court has renewed its consideration of the cross motions\nfor summary judgment, considering Mr. Rivero's report as part of the\nrecord.

[Doc. No. 194-3 at 1-2, 6,\n27]. His investigations \"involved the review of payroll documents for\ncredibility, completeness and accuracy .\" Id at 2. Many of Mr. Rivero's\ninvestigations involved \"agricultural operations that paid workers on a piece\nrate basis.\" Id at 6.

[Doc. No. 194-3 at\n25-26]. Across Mr. Rivero's sample, 73% of crews exhibited a pattern of\nwide variation in hours recorded for crew members whom the record\nindicates worked together. Id. Seventy-five percent (75%) of crews on\nwhich named or opt-in Plaintiffs worked showed evidence of record\ninaccuracy in every workweek Mr. Rivero examined.

Defendants\nfailed to make, keep and preserve complete and accurate records of the\nPlaintiffs' work hours and piece rate production as a normal part of their\nbusiness practices.

No. 393], Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Award\nStatutory Damages [Doc. No. 395], and the Reply in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to\nAward Statutory Damages [Doc. No. 396].  For the reasons stated below, the Court\ngrants  Plaintiffs’  Motion  to  Award  Statutory  Damages  and  awards  statutory\ndamages in the total amount of $499,858.74. \nThis  class  action  lawsuit  was  brought  by  three  migrant  farmworkers\nemployed by Defendants Eller & Sons Trees, Inc. and Jerry Eller (collectively\nreferred to herein as “Defendants”) as forestry workers at various times beginning\non June 1, 1999.  Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29\nU.S.C. §§ 201-19 (“FLSA”), and of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker\nProtection Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1801-71 (“AWPA”).  Relevant to the instant Motion, the\nCourt certified Plaintiffs’ Count I AWPA claims as a Rule 23(b)(3) class action on\nSeptember 28, 2006.  (Doc. No. 100.)  The certified class includes Defendants’ non-\nsupervisory H-2B guestworkers employed during the eight forestry seasons running\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 405   Filed 09/28/12   Page 2 of 6\nfrom 1999-2000 through the 2006-2007 forestry season.  \nThe Court previously has found multiple distinct violations of the AWPA.  In\ntwo separate Orders [Doc. Nos. 335 and 366], this Court granted partial summary\njudgment to Plaintiffs and found class-wide violations of the AWPA.  Plaintiffs do\nnot seek statutory damages for the violations of the AWPA found in the Court’s\nOrder entered on October 7, 2008 (the “October 2008 Summary Judgment Order”).\nInstead, Plaintiffs seek an award of actual damages for those violations and have\nfiled a Stipulation Regarding Actual Damages Related to Claims Determined on\nSummary  Judgment  [Doc.  No.  394].    The  instant  Motion  to  Award  Statutory\nDamages is limited to the intentional violations found by the Court in its Order\nentered on September 29, 2009 (the “September 2009 Summary Judgment Order”).\nThe Court previously found in its September 2009 Summary Judgment Order\nthat Defendants violated the AWPA’s recordkeeping requirements under 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1821(d).  Specifically, the Court found that “Defendants failed to make, keep and\npreserve complete and accurate records of the Plaintiffs’ work hours and piece rate\nproduction as a normal part of their business practices,” as required by 29 U.S.C. §\n1821(d)(1).  (Doc. No. 366 at 14.)  The Court further found that Defendants’ violation\nwas “‘intentional’ within the meaning of the AWPA.”  (Id.)     \nPlaintiffs maintain that the Court likewise found that Defendants failed to\nprovide accurate work records to the workers, but the Court made no such finding\nin  the  September  2009  Summary  Judgment  Order.    While  logic  dictates  that\nDefendants  could  not  have  consistently  provided  the  workers  accurate  work\nrecords, since Defendants did not always make, keep, and preserve accurate records,\nPlaintiffs never moved for summary judgment on their claim pursuant to 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1821(d)(2) that Defendants failed to provide the workers accurate work records.\n(See  generally  Pls.’  Mot.  for  Partial  Summ.  J.  Finding  Violations  of  AWPA\nRecordkeeping Requirements [Doc. No. 208].)  The Court did deny Defendants’\ncross-motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs’ claim under 29 U.S.C.\n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 405   Filed 09/28/12   Page 3 of 6\n§ 1821(d)(2).  However, insofar as the Court never granted judgment in favor of\nPlaintiffs based on a failure by Defendants to provide records under § 1821(d)(2),\nPlaintiffs,  at  this  time,  may  recover  statutory  damages  only  for  Defendants’\nviolations of 29 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(1).  \nThe AWPA authorizes an election of remedies for AWPA violations as\nfollows:\nIf the court finds that the respondent has intentionally violated any\nprovision of this [Act] or any regulation under this [Act], it may award\ndamages up to and including an amount equal to the amount of actual\ndamages, or statutory damages of up to $500 per plaintiff per violation,\nor other equitable relief, except that (A) multiple infractions of a single\nprovision of this [Act] or of regulations under this [Act] shall constitute\nonly one violation for purposes of determining the amount of statutory\ndamages due a plaintiff; and (B) if such complaint is certified as a class\naction, the court shall award no more than the lesser of up to $500 per\nplaintiff per violation, or up to $500,000 or other equitable relief.\n  \n29 U.S.C. § 1854(c)(1).  Plaintiffs who prevail on multiple AWPA claims may seek\nstatutory damages for some violations and actual damages on others.  See, e.g.,\nSaintida v. Tyre, 783 F. Supp. 1368, 1377 (S.D. Fla. 1992) (citing Salazar-Calderon v.\nPresidio Valley Farmers Ass’n, 863 F.2d 384 (5th Cir. 1989)).  \n    The same AWPA violation suffered by different individual workers constitute\nseparate violations for the purposes of calculating statutory damages pursuant to §\n29 U.S.C. § 1854(c)(1).  Elizondo v. Podgorniak, 100 F. Supp. 2d 459, 462 (E.D. Mich.\n2000); Bertrand v. Jorden, 672 F. Supp. 1417, 1426 (M.D. Fla. 1987); Sanchez v.\nOvermyer, 891 F. Supp. 1253, 1261 (N.D. Ohio 1995).  Moreover, a given violation\nis counted as multiple, distinct violations for the purposes of AWPA statutory\ndamages, when suffered by the same worker in successive seasons.  Rivera v.\nAdams Packing Ass’n, 707 F.2d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir. 1983); Elizondo, 100 F. Supp.\n2d at 461; Leach v. Johnston, 812 F. Supp. 1198, 1211 (M.D. Fla. 1992).  Where class-\nwide violations of the AWPA are found on representative evidence, as presented in\nthis case, the number of violations present for assessment of damages is derived\nmechanically from the number of seasons worked by all class members included in\n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 405   Filed 09/28/12   Page 4 of 6\nthe action.  Six (6) Mexican Workers v. Arizona Citrus Growers, 904 F.2d 1301, 1304-\n05 (9th Cir. 1990) (FLCRA); Alvarez v. Joan of Arc, Inc., 658 F.2d 1217, 1219 n.1-2 (7th\nCir. 1981); Haywood v. Barnes, 109 F.R.D. 568, 584 (E.D.N.C. 1986).  \nHere,  Plaintiffs  seek  to  recover  statutory  damages  on  behalf  of  3,878\nindividuals who worked a combined total of 7,957 forestry seasons during the 1999-\n2000 through 2006-2007 period covered by this class action.1  With respect to the\nAWPA claims under 29 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(1), Plaintiffs assert that 7,957 violations\noccurred.  Based on the authority cited above and the record in this case, including\nthe Analysis and Report Under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the AWPA of Jorge\nJ. Rivero (the “Rivero Expert Report”) [Doc. No. 194, Pls.’ Ex. 144] and the Affidavit\nof Dwight D. Stweward, Ph.D. [Doc. No. 393-2], the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that\nthe Court must assess the propriety of awarding statutory damages and the amount\nof any such damages for 7,957 violations.\nPlaintiffs suggest that a statutory damages award of $31.41 per violation is\nappropriate in this case.  Plaintiffs originally made this suggestion with the thought\nthat they would be able to recover for two distinct recordkeeping violations in each\nseason, which would have brought the total number of violations to 15,914 and the\ntotal  amount  of  statutory  damages  requested  to  $499,858.74.    Plaintiffs’  goal,\nobviously, is to recovery statutory damages in an amount that is as close as possible\nto the maximum permitted, $500,000.00.  In fact, Plaintiffs request in their reply brief\nthat, if the Court determines that Defendants violated only one provision of the\nAWPA, the Court award Plaintiffs $62.82 per violation in statutory damages.\nTherefore, in light of the Court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs presently can seek\nrecovery for only the violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(1), the Court will evaluate\n1 This number is derived by crediting each of the 1,360 class members who\nworked in the 1999-2000 season with one season, adding to that total one season for each\nof the 1,325 class members who worked in the 2000-2001 season and so forth with respect\nto the eight seasons treated in this case.  \n- 4 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 405   Filed 09/28/12   Page 5 of 6\nwhether an award of $62.82 per violation is appropriate.          \nCourts use the following factors to assess the appropriateness of statutory\ndamages awarded under the AWPA: (1) the amount allowed to each plaintiff for\neach violation; (2) the total amount of the award; (3) the nature and persistence of\nthe violations; (4) the extent of the defendants’ culpability; (5) damage awards in\nsimilar cases; (6) the defendants’ ability to prevent future violations of the AWPA;\n(7) the substantive or technical nature of the violations; (8) the circumstances of the\ncase; (9) the total number of plaintiffs involved; (10) the total number of violations;\nand (11) the plaintiffs’ recovery on closely related claims in the same suit that will\nin part compensate the damages caused by violations of the AWPA.  Beliz v. W.H.\nMcLeod & Sons Packing Co., 765 F.2d 1317, 1332-33 (5th Cir. 1985); Saintida v. Tyre,\n783 F. Supp. at 1375; Wales v. Jack M. Berry, Inc., 192 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1308-09 (M.D.\nFla. 2000) (citation omitted); Bertrand, 672 F. Supp. at 1422 (M.D. Fla. 1987).  \nThe balance of the foregoing factors weighs in favor of assessing statutory\ndamages and awarding statutory damages in the amount of $62.82 per violation per\nplaintiff.  As an initial matter, while Defendants argue that Plaintiffs pointed to\nevidence of only 100 AWPA recordkeeping violations in the daily field work\nrecords, the Court found in its 2009 Summary Judgment Order that the entire record,\nincluding the deposition testimony of 15 crew leaders and the Rivero Expert Report,\ndemonstrated that these violations were class-wide.  There were consistent patterns\nof inaccuracy among all crewleaders and across all seasons covered by this lawsuit.\nThe Court likewise finds that the violations at issue are not mere technical violations\nbut are “core protections offered by the [AWPA]”.  See Sanchez, 891 F. Supp. at 1261;\nBertrand, 672 F. Supp. at 1426.  Further, cases relied on by Plaintiffs and Defendants\nindicate that an award of $62.82 per violation in this case is more than reasonable,\nas many courts have awarded the statutory maximum of $500 per plaintiff per\nviolation.  See Herrera v. Singh, 103 F. Supp. 2d 1244, 1252 (E.D. Wash. 2000); Avila\nv. A. Sam & Sons, 856 F. Supp. 763, 774 (W.D.N.Y. 1994); Bertrand, 672 F. Supp. at\n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 405   Filed 09/28/12   Page 6 of 6\n1426; Alzalde v. Ocanas, 580 F. Supp. 1394, 1396 (D. Colo. 1984).  The Court\nrecognizes that awarding $62.82 per violation in this case results in a total award\nclosely approaching the $500,000.00 maximum for the class, but the 3,872 individuals\nseeking  recovery  are  receiving  a  relatively  small  amount  for  the  violations.\nAdditionally, an award of this magnitude is warranted, as Defendants had been\ncited by the U.S. Department of Labor for past violations of the AWPA and thus\nwere well aware of the AWPA and its requirements.  Defendant Jerry Eller, who had\nattended  training  sessions  on  the  AWPA,  was  actively  involved  in  training\nsupervisors in recordkeeping but failed to ensure that the supervisors complied with\nthe AWPA.  Finally, to the extent that there is any overlap between these violations\nand the other claims for which Plaintiffs are recovering, the overlap is minimal.\nPlaintiffs’ recovery of the statutory damages allowed will not duplicate recovery on\nother claims in this action.\nBased on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion to Award\nStatutory Damages [Doc. No. 393] and AWARDS Plaintiffs $499,858.74 in statutory\ndamages pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1854(c)(1).\n \nSO ORDERED this 28th day of September, 2012.\ns/   CLARENCE COOPER\nCLARENCE COOPER\nSENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n- 6 -",

This action is brought by migrant agricultural  workers who were \nadmitted to the United States to work under the H-2B temporary foreign worker visa \nprogram.  The Plaintiffs have been employed in the forestry operations of the \nDefendants at various times during the period from June 1999 through the filing of \nthis Complaint.  The Plaintiffs seek redress on behalf of themselves and all others \n \n  -1- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 2 of 19\nsimilarly situated for the Defendants’ violations of their rights under the Migrant and \nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1871 (1999) \n(“AWPA”) and the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-219 (1998) \n(“FLSA”). \n2.   This action is brought on behalf of a class of over 3,700 \npredominantly Guatemalan, Mexican and Honduran migrant workers who planted \ntrees and performed other forestry-related activities for the Defendants.  The Plaintiffs \nand other class members are indigent migrant workers who the Defendants brought to \nthe United States on temporary, H-2B work visas.  The Plaintiffs and other class \nmembers left their homes and families and spent considerable money and effort to \ncome to the United States to perform arduous jobs, which the Defendants have \ncertified that American workers were not willing to do.   \n3.  Almost all of the Plaintiffs and other class members are non-English \nspeakers who had little, if any, understanding of their legal rights while working in the \nUnited States as H-2B forestry workers.  The Defendants took full advantage of the \nPlaintiffs’ and other class members’ indigence, inability to speak or understand \nEnglish, and their lack of understanding of the laws of the United States to grossly \nunderpay them.   \n4.  The Plaintiffs and many other class members were required by \n \n  -2- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 3 of 19\nDefendants’ agents to leave the deeds to their homes or land in Guatemala with the \ndefendants’ agents in order to obtain employment with the Defendants.   These \nPlaintiffs and other class members were thus particularly vulnerable to coercion and \nexploitation by the Defendants, as they believed they might lose their property if they \nfailed to comply with the directives of the Defendants.   \n    5.  The Plaintiffs seek an award of unpaid wages, an award of money \ndamages and declaratory relief to make them whole for damages they suffered due to \nthe Defendants’ violations of law. \n  JURISDICTION \n6.  Jurisdiction is conferred upon this court by 28 U.S.C. § 1331, this case \n  arising under the laws of the United States,  28 U.S.C. § 1337, this action arising \nunder Acts of Congress regulating commerce, 29 U.S.C. § 1854(a), this action arising \nunder the AWPA, and 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), this action arising under the FLSA. \n  7.     The Court is empowered to issue a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \nVENUE \n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (c) \nand 29 U.S.C. § 1854(a). \n  PARTIES \n9.  At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiffs and the other class members  \n \n  -3- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 4 of 19\nwere H-2B temporary foreign workers within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b).   \n10.    At all times relevant to this action, the Plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers were migrant agricultural workers within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § \n1802(8)(A), in that they were employed in agricultural employment of a seasonal \nnature and were required to be absent overnight from their permanent places of \nresidence. \n  11.    Substantial agricultural work was performed by the Plaintiffs and other \nclass members for the Defendants in this state and within this District.   \n  12.  At all times relevant to this action, the Plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers were engaged in agricultural employment for the Defendants within the \nmeaning of 29 U.S.C. § 1802(3). \n  13.     At all times relevant to this action the Plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers were employees of the Defendants within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § \n203(e)(1). \n14.     At all times relevant to this action, the Plaintiffs and the other class  \nmembers were employed by the Defendants within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. §203(g). \n   15.     At all times relevant to this action, the Plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers were employed by the Defendants in an enterprise engaged in commerce or \n \n  -4- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 5 of 19\nthe production of goods for commerce. \n  16.   Defendant Eller and Sons Trees, Inc. is a Georgia corporation which \nconducts business in this District.   \n17.     At all times relevant to this action Defendant Eller and Sons Trees, Inc. \nwas an agricultural employer within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 1802(2). \n  18.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendant Eller and Sons Trees, Inc. \nemployed the Plaintiffs and the other class members within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \n§ 1802(5) and 29 U.S.C. § 203(g). \n19.    Defendant Jerry Eller is an individual resident of Montana who \nconducted significant business in this District.  Defendant Jerry Eller had significant \ncontacts with the state of Georgia and this District such that jurisdiction and venue are \nproper in this Court.   \n 20.   At all times relevant to this action, Defendant Jerry Eller employed the \nPlaintiffs and the other class members within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 1802(5) and \n29 U.S.C. § 203(g). \n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n21.  The Defendants operate a tree-planting service, in which they bid on and \nnegotiate contracts to plant trees on land owned by other individuals and companies.  \nTo fill the manpower requirements of their contracts, the Defendants sought \n \n  -5- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 6 of 19\nimportation of foreign nationals to perform forestry work on a seasonal or temporary \nbasis, in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b). \n22.    The Plaintiffs and the other members of the class were admitted to the \nUnited States to be employed as members of labor crews organized by the Defendants. \n Each of the Plaintiffs and the other class members was issued a temporary visa, \ncommonly referred to as an “H-2B visa,” as authorized by 8 U.S.C. § \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), its attendant regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(6), 20 C.F.R. § \n655.3, and administrative letters and/or guidance.  The Plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers were admitted to the United States and were employed by the Defendants.  \n  23.  The Plaintiffs and other class members spent considerable sums of \nmoney to process their H-2B work visas and travel from their home villages to the \nUnited States.  These costs were incurred by the Plaintiffs and other class members for \nthe primary benefit of their Defendant employers.   \n24.    In addition, as a condition of being hired, the Plaintiffs and many other \nclass members were required to leave collateral, in the form of the deed to their land, \nwith the Defendants’ agents in Guatemala.  The Plaintiffs and other class members \nwere required to leave this deed with Defendants’ agents so that the Defendants could \nbe assured that the workers would remain under the control of and in the employ of \n \n  -6- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 7 of 19\nthe Defendants.  The requirement that Plaintiffs leave their deeds had an extremely \ncoercive effect upon the Plaintiffs and other class members.  The Defendants have not \nreturned these documents to Plaintiff Armenio Pablo-Calmo, nor to many other class \nmembers. \n  25.    As a condition of obtaining H-2B visas for the Plaintiffs and the other \nclass members, the Defendants certified to the United States Department of Labor that, \ninter alia, the wages paid the Plaintiffs and other class members would equal or exceed \nthe applicable prevailing wage, that the jobs offered would be full-time jobs of 40 \nhours per week, and that the job would not contravene Federal, State, or local law, \nincluding applicable requirements of the H-2B program, as set out in Department of \nLabor regulations and administrative interpretations.        \n  26.  When the Defendants provided information to the Plaintiffs regarding \nwork hours and manner of compensation, the information provided was false and \nmisleading.   \n  27.  The Defendants did not issue accurate and complete records regarding \nthe employment of the Plaintiffs and other class members.  The records the \nDefendants kept of the Plaintiffs’ work were inadequate, inaccurate, false and \nmisleading.  \n28.    The Plaintiffs and other class members performed arduous tree planting \n \n  -7- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 8 of 19\nand associated forestry work for the Defendants in Georgia and other states.  They \nregularly worked far in excess of 40 hours in a given workweek.  \n  29.    The Defendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nclass the minimum wage for all the work they performed.  \n  30.  The Defendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nclass the proper prevailing wage for all the work they performed.   \n31.  The Defendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nclass overtime wages for all work they performed in excess of forty (40) hours in a \ngiven workweek.   \n  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n  32.    All claims set forth in Count I are brought by the Plaintiffs on behalf of \nthemselves and all other similarly situated persons pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n  33.   The named Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all those \nindividuals admitted as H-2B temporary foreign workers pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), who were employed in the Defendants’ forestry operations \nfrom June 1999 until the present.   \n   34.     The number of individuals in the class exceeds 3,700.  The class is \ncomprised principally of indigent migrant farmworkers who maintain their residences \nin locations throughout Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras.  The class members are not \n \n  -8- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 9 of 19\nfluent in the English language.  Indeed, many of the class members speak indigenous \nMayan languages as their primary language, and speak Spanish as a second language, \nwith varying degrees of proficiency. The relatively small size of the individual claims, \nthe geographical dispersion of the class, and the indigency of the class members \nmakes the maintenance of separate actions by each class member economically \ninfeasible.  Joinder of all class members is impracticable. \n35.    There are questions of fact and law common to the class.  These common \nquestions include whether the Defendants failed to pay the named Plaintiffs and other \nclass members prevailing and overtime wages promptly when due, as required by law \nand their employment contracts; whether Defendants failed to maintain complete and \naccurate records regarding the Plaintiffs’ and the class members’ work; whether the \nDefendants failed to provide the Plaintiffs and the class members with complete and \naccurate wage statements; whether the failure of the Defendants to pay the Plaintiffs \nand the class members the prevailing wage and overtime pay as required by the H-2B \ntemporary foreign labor program violated the AWPA’s wage payment and working \narrangement provisions; whether the Defendants’ failure to pay the class members for \nat least 40 hours of work each week violated the AWPA’s wage payment and working \narrangement provisions; and whether the Defendants’ failure to maintain complete and \naccurate records regarding the work of the Plaintiffs and the class members, and \n \n  -9- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 10 of 19\nDefendants’ failure to provide the named Plaintiffs and the class members with \ncomplete and accurate wage statements, were violations of the AWPA. \n36.    The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the class, and these \ntypical, common claims predominate over any questions affecting only individual \nclass members.  The named Plaintiffs have the same interests as do the other members \nof the class and will vigorously prosecute these interests on behalf of the class. \n  37.    Counsel for the Plaintiffs have handled numerous AWPA and FLSA \nactions in the federal courts.  They are prepared to advance litigation costs necessary \nto vigorously litigate this action. \n38.    A class action under Rule 23(b)(3) is superior to other available methods \nof adjudicating this controversy because, inter alia: \n• \nThe common issues of law and fact, as well as the relatively small size \nof the individual class members’ claims, substantially diminish the \ninterest of members of the class in individually controlling the \nprosecution of separate actions; \n• \nMany members of the class are unaware of their rights to prosecute \nthese claims and lack the means or resources to secure legal \nassistance; \n• \nThere has been no litigation already commenced against the \n \n  -10- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 11 of 19\nDefendants by the members of the class to determine the questions \npresented; \n• \nIt is desirable that the claims be heard in this forum since the \nDefendants have significant contacts with this District; and \n• \nA class action can be managed without undue difficulty since the \nDefendants have regularly committed the violations complained of \nherein, and are required to maintain detailed records concerning each \nmember of the class. \n \n  COUNT I \nMIGRANT AND SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL  \nWORKER PROTECTION ACT \n  (CLASS ACTION) \n \n39.   This count sets forth a claim by the Plaintiffs and the other members of \nthe class for money damages and declaratory relief, with respect to the Defendants’ \nviolations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act \n(“AWPA”).   \n40.    The Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set \nforth in paragraphs 1 through 38 above. \n \n \n  -11- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 12 of 19\nCOUNT I(A): WORKING ARRANGEMENT VIOLATIONS AND FAILURE \nTO PAY WAGES WHEN DUE \n41.   The certifications described in paragraph 25 above constituted a working \narrangement between the Defendants and the Plaintiffs and other class members \nwithin the meaning of the AWPA, 29 U.S.C. § 1822(c), and its attendant regulations, \n29 C.F.R. § 500.72. \n42.    The Defendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nclass the proper prevailing wage for all the work they performed in their first weeks of \nwork in each season.  \n43.     The violation of the AWPA as set out in paragraph 42, resulted in part \nfrom the Defendants’ failure to reimburse the Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nclass for expenses they incurred which were primarily for the benefit of the \nDefendants, as well as from the Defendants’ unlawful withholdings and deductions \nfrom the wages of the Plaintiffs and the other class members.  These unreimbursed \nexpenses and deductions from wages unlawfully reduced Plaintiffs’ and other class \nmembers’ wages paid for their first week of work in each season, below the prevailing \nwage rate. \n  44.   The Defendants, who were obligated to offer full time employment to the \nPlaintiffs and other class members, consistently failed to pay workers for at least 40 \nhours of work each week.   \n \n  -12- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 13 of 19\n  45.    By their actions as described in paragraphs 42, 43 and 44,  the \nDefendants violated without justification their working arrangement with the Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the class, thereby violating the AWPA, 29 U.S.C. § 1822(c), \nand its attendant regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 500.72. \n  46.  By their actions as described in paragraphs 42, 43 and 44 the Defendants \nfailed to pay the Plaintiffs and other members of the class their wages owed promptly \nwhen due, thereby violating the AWPA, 29 U.S.C. § 1822(a), and its attendant \nregulations, 29 C.F.R. § 500.81. \nCOUNT I(B):  RECORDKEEPING VIOLATIONS \n  47.    The Defendants failed to make, keep, and preserve accurate and \ncomplete records regarding the Plaintiffs’ and the other class members’ employment, \nin violation of the AWPA, 29 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(1), and its attendant regulations, 29 \nC.F.R. § 500.80(a).  \n48.  The Defendants failed to provide the Plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers complete and accurate itemized written statements for each pay period \ncontaining the required information, in violation of the AWPA, 29 U.S.C. § \n1821(d)(2), and its attendant regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 500.80(d).    \n  49.  The violations of the AWPA and its attendant regulations as set forth in \nCount I were the natural consequences of the conscious and deliberate actions of the \nDefendants and were intentional within the meaning of the AWPA, 29 U.S.C. § \n \n  -13- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 14 of 19\n1854(c)(1). \n  50.    As a result of the Defendants’ violations of the AWPA and its attendant \nregulations as set forth in this count, the Plaintiffs and the other members of the class \nhave suffered damages. \n \n  COUNT II \n  FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT \n  (COLLECTIVE ACTION) \n \n51.   This count sets forth a claim for declaratory relief and damages for the \nDefendants’ violations of the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards \nAct (“FLSA”). This count is brought by the Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and \nother current or former H-2B temporary foreign workers employed by the Defendants \nwho are similarly situated. \n  52.   The Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set \nforth in paragraphs 1 through 31 above. \n  53.  Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), representative Plaintiffs Escolastico De \nLeon-Granados, Isaías Profeta De Leon-Granados and Armenio Pablo-Calmo have \nconsented in writing to be party plaintiffs in this FLSA action. Their written consents \nwere attached to the Plaintiffs’ original complaint.   \n  54.    The Defendants violated 29 U.S.C. § 206(a) by failing to pay each of the \n \n  -14- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 15 of 19\nPlaintiffs and others similarly situated the applicable minimum wage for every \ncompensable hour of labor they performed. \n55.    The violations of the FLSA set out in paragraph 54 resulted, in part, from \nthe Defendants’ failure to reimburse the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated for \nexpenses they incurred which were primarily for the benefit of the Defendants.  These \nunreimbursed expenses unlawfully reduced the wages paid Plaintiffs for their first \nweek of work in each season below the FLSA minimum wage rate.   \n66.  The violations of the FLSA set out in paragraph 55 resulted, in part, from \nthe Defendants’ unlawful withholdings and deductions from the wages of the \nPlaintiffs and others similarly situated.  These deductions unlawfully reduced the \nwages paid Plaintiffs for their first week of work in each season below the FLSA \nminimum wage rate.   \n67.  The Defendants’ failures to pay the Plaintiffs and others similarly \nsituated their federally mandated minimum wages were willful violations of the FLSA \nwithin the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 255(a).   \n68.  As a consequence of the Defendants’ violation of the FLSA, the Plaintiffs \nand others similarly situated are entitled to recover their unpaid minimum and \novertime wages, plus an additional equal amount in liquidated damages, costs of suit, \nand reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). \n \n  -15- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 16 of 19\n  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs pray that this Court will enter an order: \n  1.    Certifying this case as a class action in accordance with Rule 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with respect to the claims set forth in Count I; \n  2.    With respect to the claims set forth in Count II, permitting this case to \nproceed as a collective action; \n3.    Declaring that the Defendants intentionally violated the Migrant and \nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act and its attendant regulations, as set forth \nin Count I; \n  4.    Declaring that the Defendants willfully violated the minimum wage \nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as set forth in Count II; \n  5.    Granting judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs and the other class members \nand against the Defendants, jointly and severally, on these Plaintiffs’ and other class \nmembers’ claims under the AWPA as set forth in Count I;  \n  6.

Awarding each of the Plaintiffs and the other class members statutory \ndamages for each of the two AWPA violations set forth in Count I(B);  \n  8.    Granting judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs and all others similarly \nsituated and against the Defendants, jointly and severally, on their claims under the \n \n  -16- \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01473-CC   Document 389-2   Filed 07/22/10   Page 17 of 19\nFair Labor Standards Act as set forth in Count II and awarding each of these Plaintiffs \nand all other similarly situated individuals who opt-in to this action his unpaid \nminimum wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages; \n  9.

Georgia, Atlanta Division.\nSeptember 28, 2006.\n1283 *1283 Alex R. Gulotta, Charlottesville, VA, Andrew H. Turner, Kelley Bruner, Mary C. Bauer, Montgomery, AL,\nGeorge Brian Spears, Law Office of Brian Spears, Atlanta, GA, James M. Knoepp, Tim A. Freilich, Falls Church,\nVA, for Plaintiffs.\nJames Larry Stine, Wimberly Lawson Steckel Nelson & Schneider, Atlanta, GA, for Defendants.\nDISCOVERY ORDER\nCOOPER, District Judge.\nThis matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents [Doc. No. 37], Plaintiffs'\nMotion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories [Doc. No. 38], and Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Compliance with\nSubpoena Duces Tecum [Doc. No. 95]. The Court addresses each of these motions in turn below but first\naddresses a primary issue in dispute between the parties, the statute of limitations applicable to Plaintiffs' claim\nbrought pursuant to the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (\"AWPA\").\nI. APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMTATIONS\nThe AWPA does not contain a limitations period within which an action must be brought. Accordingly, the Court\nmust \"borrow\" the statute of limitations applicable to analogous claims under the state law of the forum state.\n1284 *1284 The Eleventh Circuit has designed a two-step analysis to be applied when a federal court\nseeks to \"borrow\" a state statute of limitations in actions brought under a federal civil rights statute\nwhich does not contain its own statute of limitations. In choosing which state statute of limitations\nto apply to claims under the federal civil rights statutes, we must engage in a two-step analysis:\n`first, what under federal law is the \"essential nature\" of the claim, and second, what statute of\nlimitations would the state courts hold applicable to this type or class of claim.'\nSolomon v. Hardison 746 F.2d 699 (11th Cir.1984) (citations omitted). Here, the parties agree that the essential\nnature of Plaintiffs' AWPA claim is breach of their employment contract with Defendant Eller & Sons Trees, Inc.\n(\"Defendant\"). The parties disagree, however, on the statute of limitations that Georgia courts would hold\napplicable to this type or class of claim. Plaintiffs assert that O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24's six-year statute of limitations\napplies, which governs claims on written contracts in Georgia. By contrast, Defendant asserts that O.C.G.A. §\n9-3-22's two-year statute of limitations applies, which is the statute of limitations for wage claims and governs\nclaims arising under statutes.\nHaving considered the respective positions of both Plaintiffs and Defendant and having read and considered the\nlaw cited by both parties, the Court finds that the applicable statute of limitations in this case is the six-year\nstatute of limitations provided in O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24. A review of Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint reveals that\nmost of Plaintiffs' AWPA claims seek redress for breaches of their \"working arrangement,'! a written expression of\nwhich is required by 29 U.S.C. § 1822 and 18 U.S.C. § 1831. Plaintiffs explain that their written \"working\narrangement\" contract is embodied in the U.S. Department of Labor's Form ETA 750 \"Job Clearance Orders\" and\n\nin Defendant's disclosure contract, which set forth Plaintiffs' terms and conditions of employment, and which\nDefendant required each worker to sign before starting work. Georgia law is clear that \"where the contract\nforming the basis of the action is in writing, the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24 are applicable.\" Muscogee\nCounty Bd. of Educ. v. Boisvert, 196 Ga.App. 537, 539, 396 S.E.2d 303 (1990) (emphasis in original). Defendant\nhas not cited a single case in which the two-year statute of limitations provided in O.C.G.A. § 9-3-22 was applied\nto a contractual claim for wages. Moreover, selecting the six-year limitations period over the two-year limitations\nperiod comports with \"our paramount duty . . . to effectuate the federal policies embodied in the AWPA statutory\nscheme.\" Barajas v. Bermudez, 43 F.3d 1251, 1260 (9th Cir. 1994) (choosing longer of two potentially applicable\nstatutes of limitations in effort to effectuate policy goals of AWPA); see alsoCaro-Galvan v. Curtis Richardson,\nInc., 993 F.2d 1500, 1505 (11th Cir.1993) (\"AWPA is a remedial statute and should be construed broadly to effect\nits humanitarian purpose.\"); Sanchez v. Morrison, 667 F.Supp. 536, 538 (W.D.Mich.1987) (noting the broad\nremedial purposes of the AWPA in deciding to apply Michigan's sixyear statute of limitations for breach of contract\nrather than the three-year period for injury to property or person). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the\nstatute of limitations properly applied to Plaintiffs' AWPA claims is the six-year period provided in O.C.G.A. §\n9-3-24 governing simple contracts in writing.\nII. PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO COPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCMENTS\n1285 Plaintiffs move the Court for an order compelling Defendant to produce for inspection *1285 and copying those\ndocuments and things sought through Plaintiffs' First Request for Production of Documents to Defendant Eller &\nSons Trees, Inc. Specifically, Plaintiffs moves the Court to compel Defendant to respond to requests for\nproduction # 1-9, 11-13, 15, 19, and 20. Having reviewed the production requests at issue, the corresponding\nobjections by Defendant, the respective positions of the parties, and the law relied on by both Plaintiffs and\nDefendant, the Court hereby orders the, following:\n(1) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 1 to the extent that\nthe Court orders Defendant to produce payroll records, wage statements, ledgers, \"score sheets,\" and check\nstubs for all H-2B workers, including the Plaintiffs, it employed in any capacity between June 6, 1999, and the\npresent.\n(2) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 2 to the extent that\nthe Court orders Defendant to produce the visas and passports of all H-2B workers it employed between June 6,\n1999, and the present.\n(3) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 3.\n(4) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 4.\n(5) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for ` Production # 5.\n(6) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 6.\n(7) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 7.\n(8) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 8.\n(9) The Court DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 9, as it is undisputed\nthat Defendant did not pay the visa costs for its H-2B workers.\n(11) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 11.\n(12) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 12.\n(13) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 13.\n(15) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 15 to the extent\nthat Defendant is required to produce all responsive documents for the time period of twelve (12) years preceding\nthe commencement of this action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court DIRECTS the parties to confer about\nlimiting the scope of the documents requested.\n\n(19) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 19.\n(20) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Mo, tion to Compel with respect to Request for Production # 20.\nIn sum, Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. All\ndocuments ordered to be produced shall be produced within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Order.\nIII. PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO COPEL RESPONSES TO INTEROGATORIES\n1286 Plaintiffs next move the Court for an order compelling Defendant to provide full *1286 answers to Plaintiff\nEscolastico De Leon-Granados' First Set of Interrogatories to Defendant Eller & Sons, Inc. Specifically, Plaintiffs\nmoves the Court to compel Defendant to respond to interrogatories # 1-6 and 8. Having reviewed the\ninterrogatories at issue, the corresponding objections by Defendant, the respective positions of the parties, and\nthe law relied on by both Plaintiffs and Defendant, the Court hereby orders the following:\n(1) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Interrogatory # 1.\n(2) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Interrogatory # 2.\n(3) In light of the fact that Plaintiffs are not direct competitors of Defendant, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion\nto Compel with respect to Interrogatory # 3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court DIRECTS the parties to\nconfer regarding a suitable confidentiality agreement/protective order.\n(4) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Interrogatory # 4.\n(5) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Interrogatory # 5.\n(6) The Court DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to. Interrogatory # 6, as the interrogatory was\npoorly worded and did not clearly request information about investigations.\n(8) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel with respect to Interrogatory # 8.\nIn sum, Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories is GRANED in part and DENIED in part.\nDefendant shall fully respond to the interrogatories as to which the Court granted the Motion to Compel within\nforty-five (45) days from the date of this Order.\nIV. PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO COPEL COMPLIANCE WITH SUPOENA DUCES TECUM\nInsofar as Plaintiffs' class certification motion has been resolved, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel\nCompliance with Subpoena Duces Tecum. The Court directs Defendant to provide the requested documents to\nPlaintiffs within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Order.\nV.
