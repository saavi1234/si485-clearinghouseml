As agreed, the class definition is amended to be \"All male inmates who, on or after February 12, 2002, have been subjected to defendant's policy and practice of strip searching a male inmate upon his return to the jail following a court appearance at which court appearance a specific case or charge against the inmate was dismissed when no other cases, charges, warrants or holds were pending against that inmate which warranted that inmate's continued detention at the jail.\" Notice will be sent first class mail based on last known addresses. Any posting of notice will await further proceedings in the case. If Judge Schenkier decides that additional time is needed for discovery he may change the schedule.

    "summary": "<p>On February 11, 2004, two named plaintiffs filed this civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In their complaint (as amended nine days later), the plaintiffs challenged the Cook County Sheriff's policy of strip searching all males following their return to the Cook County Jail from court after there was a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention. The plaintiffs also alleged that female detainees were not subjected to similar treatment, as they were placed in a holding cell after returning from court and processed out of the jail without being strip searched or re-entering the general housing units. The strip searches without reasonable suspicion and the differential treatment, the plaintiffs alleged, violated their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs sought monetary damages, injunctive relief and class certification.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants generally denied the allegations and contended that the strip searches were necessary, for there was no space in the jail to construct additional bullpens to house the discharged male detainees so that they would not be required to enter the housing units and undergo strip searches.</p>\r\n<p>On November 22, 2004, the District Court (District Judge Elaine Bucklo) certified the case as a class action, with the class defined as follows: all male inmates who, on or after February 12, 2002, have been subjected to defendants' policy, practice and custom of strip searching, without reasonable suspicion that the inmate is concealing a weapon or other contraband, at the Cook County Department of Corrections, following their return from court after there had been a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention, other than to be processed for release. Bullock v. Sheahan, 225 F.R.D. 227 (N.D. Ill. 2004).</p>\r\n<p>Discovery ensued and included substantial document production, depositions and experts. The defendants sought to preclude the testimony of one of plaintiffs' retained experts, Donald Henry. Mr. Henry was a registered architect specializing in the design of prisons and jails and was retained by the plaintiffs to inspect the jail and offer an opinion whether there was adequate space for the construction of additional bullpens to hold male detainees. Judge Bucklo denied the motion. Bullock v. Sheahan, 519 F.Supp.2d 760 (N.D.Ill. 2007).</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the following four claims:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The strip searching of all male court discharged persons and not all female court discharged persons violated the Equal Protection Clause.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The strip searching of all male court discharged persons in large non-private group settings, with up to fifty inmates, while the female court discharged persons who opted to return to the housing divisions were afforded privacy, violated the Equal Protection Clause.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The strip searching of all male court discharged persons not based upon reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband violated the Fourth Amendment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The manner in which the strip searches were conducted, in large non-private group settings, violated the Fourth Amendment. Defendants moved to strike portions of plaintiffs' motion (as to the second and fourth claim), asserting that plaintiffs were adding new theories of liability not pleaded in their amended complaint. Judge Bucklo denied the motion to strike, but allowed defendants to conduct additional discovery as to those claims. Bullock v. Sheahan, 519 F.Supp.2d 763 (N.D.Ill. 2007).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 30, 2008, the district court (Judge Bucklo) granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, and on February 27, 2009, Judge Bucklo partially granted that motion with respect to the portions of the earlier order that granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their Fourteenth Amendment claims and on some of their Fourth Amendment claims.</p>\r\n<p>On March 18, 2011, the court approved a proposed class settlement. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement. The defendants agreed to pay $1.4 million to class members and roughly $2 million in attorney's fees and costs. The defendants also agreed to pay the two class representatives $25,000 as \"incentive awards\" for serving as the representatives. However, the defendants later discovered that one of the class representatives had certified that he had no legal claims of any value during bankruptcy proceedings in 2010, so he couldn't receive this incentive award. The agreed with the defendants and issued an opinion on May 23, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>Over the next two years, the defendants paid claims submitted by class members. The court oversaw the payments and denied late claims and other challenges. The court terminated its jurisdiction over the case on September 1, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>Note: There was another (separate) strip search case against the Cook County Sheriff in the same District Court. That case, <a href=\"../../../../case/9811/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Young v. Cook County</a>, 1:06-cv-00552, alleged an unconstitutional practice of strip searching all pretrial detainees upon their entry in the Cook County Jail for intake/booking.</p>",

Morrissey and Robert H. Farley, Jr., submit this Memorandum in\nSupport of their Motion for Class Certification.\nINTRODUCTION\nPlaintiffs’ Amended Class Action Complaint asserts a putative class action against\nDefendants on behalf of individuals who have been strip searched without any individualized\nfinding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that they were concealing contraband or\nweapons at the Cook County Departmem of Corrections (\"Jail\") upon their return from court\nappearances that entitled them to release. The defendants admit that the Sheriff has a policy, and\npractice of strip searching only male inmates after there has been a judicial determination that\nthere is no longer a basis for their detention other than to be processed for release from the Jail.\n\n(Def. Answer Amend. Compl. par. 17). The defendants also admit that the named plaintiffs,\nQuentin Bullock and Jack Reid, were strip searched pursuant to this policy and practice upon\n¯\nreturning to the Jail after court appearances where they were found not guilty. (Def. Answer\nAmend. Compl. pars. 7, 8, 10, &l 1). The plaintiffs allege that the defendants’ strip search policy\nis unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nThe Shedffwas previously a defendant in a similar class action lawsuit which alleged\nthat the female inmates were strip searched after their return from court appearance that made\nthem eligible for release from the Jail. Gary v. Sheahan, No. 96 C 7294 (Coar, J.). Although at\nthe time of the filing oftha~ lawsuit, the Jail had a written policy which required all inmates to be\nstrip searched upon their return form court, the Court found that while all females were strip\nsearched, there was no uniform practice in regards to strip searching male court returns. Gary v.\nSheahan, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 13378 at. \"16-17. Following the entry era preliminary injunction\nbarring the strip searching of female inmates returning to the Jail from court appearances which\nmade them eligible for release, and prior to the Court’s entry of summary judgment for the class,\nthe Jail changed its practice in regards to male court returns and issued orders requiring the strip\nsearching of all male inmates returning from court. ARer the Gary Court heard testimony of\nblatant violations of the preliminary injunction order, a permanent injunction was issued\nenjoining the Jail\" from strip searching female inmate court returnees who have been judicially\ndischarged from the Cook County DeparUnent of Corrections.\" Gary, 1999 U.S. Dist. Lexis\n17305.\n\nCLASS DEFINITION\nThe proposed Plaintiff class is defined as follows:\nAll male inmates who have been subjected to defendants’ policy, practice and\ncustom of strip searching ,without reasonable suspicion that the inmate is\nconcealing a weapon or other contraband, at the Cook. County Department of\nCorrections (\"Jail\") following their return from court after there is a judicial\ndetermination that there is no longer a basis for their detention, other that to be\nprocessed for release.\nARGUMENT\nParties seeking class action certification must first satisfy the provisions of Rule 23(a) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Then, in addition, the ease must fit within at least one of\nthe three subcategofies under Rule 23(b). Rosario v. Lividitis~ 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7~ Cir.\n1992), cert.denied, 506 U.S. 1051, 113 S.Ct.972 (1993). All four 23 (a) prerequisites are quite\nundoubtedly satisfied here, and this ease falls squarely under the 23 (b)(3) category.\nOn a motion for class certification, the Court must accept as true all facts alleged in\nPlaintiffs’ complaint. See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-178, 94 S.Ct. 2140,\n2152 (1974) (\"We fred nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that gives court any\nauthority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether\nit may be maintained as a class action.\"); Gammon v. GC Services Limited Partnership, 162\nF.D.R. 313, 315, n. 2 (N.D. I11. 1995) (When evaluating a motion for class certification, the Court\naccepts all well-pleaded facts as true.\"); Peritz v. Liberty Loan Corp., 523 F.2d 349, 353-54 (7~\nCir. 1975); Gomez v. Illinois State Bd OfEduc., 117 F.R.D. 394, 396 (N.D. I11. 1987): Newburg\non Class Actions, See. 3.20, p. 3-124 (\"It is settled law that any preliminary inquiry into or\nconsideration of the merits of litigation is improper in cormeetion with a determination of the\n\npropriety of a class action.\") Moreover, \"the interests of justice require that in a doubtful\ncase...any error, if there is to be one, should be committed in favor of allowing a class action.\"\nEisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 785 (3~ Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 946 (1985); Esplin v.\nHirschi, 402 F.2d 94, 101 (10~ Cir.), cert. Denied, 394 U.S. 928 (1969); Tapken v. Brown, 1992\nWL 17894, *26 (S.D. Fla.); Horton v. Goose Creeklndependent School District, 690 F.2d 470,\n487, n. 32 (5t~ Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1207 (1983); Brown v. Cameron-Brown Co., 92\nF.R.D. 32, 50 (E.D. Va. 1981).\n1. Plaintiff has established the prerequisites for a class action pursuant to Rule\n23(a)\nA.    Numerosity\nNumerosity is easily met in this case. Courts in this judicial circuits have certified\nclassed with less than 50 members. Patrykus v. Goraills, 121 F.R.D. 357, 361 (N.D. Ill. 1988)\n(court certified a class of approximately 50 class members, stating that \"the complaint need not\nallege the exact number or identity of class members\"); Harris v. General Dev. Corp., 127\nF.R.D. 655, 660 (N.D. I11. 1989) (court held that numerosity was met when the plaintiffs\ndemonstrated that at least 35 individuals were members of the proposed class); Swanson v.\nAmerican Consumer Industries, 415 F.2d 1326, 1333, n.4 (72 Cir. 1996) (finding that a class of\n151 was sufficient to certify a class, but 40 would have been acceptable). Case law has also\nrecognized that courts should make \"common assumptions\" to support a finding of numerosity.\nGrossman v. Waste Management, lnc., 162 F.R.D. 322, 329 (N.D. I11. 1995). The numerosity\nrequirement should be constnaed liberally in civil rights actions. Jones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d\n1090, 1100 (52 Cir. 1975).\n4\n\nIn this case, numerosity is satisfied because the joinder of all individuals affected by the\nSheriff’s policy is impracticable. In Gary, there were approximately 12,000 putative class\nmembers and due to the fact that there are substantially more male inmates at the Jail than\nfemales, the size of the class will exceed 20,000 individuals..\nB.    Commonality\nCommonality requires that there be one or more questions of law or fact common to the\nclass. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23 (a) (2). This rule does not require that all questions of law or fact\nraised in the litigation be common. PortAuth. Police Benevolent~4ssn. V. Port~4uth., 698 F.2d\n150, 153-4 (24 Cir. 1983). There need only be a single issue common to all members of the\nclass. Harris, 127 F.R.D. at 661.\nIn fact, \"[w]hen the party opposing the class has engaged in some course of conduct that\neffects a group of persons and gives rise to a cause of action, one or more of the elements of that\ncause of action will be common to all of the persons affected.\" Newberg on Class Actions, Sec.\n3.10, p. 3-51. So long as one issue of law or fact is common to the class, \"the presence of\nindividual questions will not prevent satisfaction of the Rule 23 (a) (2) prerequisite.\" ld. at p. 3-\n60. See also Ivy v. Meridian Coco-Cola Bottling Co., 108 F.R.D. 1 I8, 123 (S.D. Miss. 1985)\n(holding that commonality and typicality were satisfied in an employment discrimination case\ndespite the defendant’s argument that individual questions would predominate concerning each\nhiring decision); Patrykus, 121 F.R.D. at 361 (holding that \"[d]ifferences in individual cases\nconcerning treatment or damages does not defeat commonality\"); Krislov v. Rednour, 946\nF.Supp. 563,568 (N.D. Ill 1996).\nIn this case, commonality is easily met because Defendants \"engaged in some course of\n\nconduct that affects a group of persons and gives rise to a cause of action.\" Newberg on Class\nActions, Sec. 3.10, p. 3-51. As previously stated, the Sheriff admits to having a policy of strip\nsearching all male inmates returning to the Jail after receiving court orders making them eligible\nfor release. In addition, all female inmates returning to the Jail with court ordered releases are\nnot strip searched. (Def. Answer Amend. Compl, par. 17). In Bynum v. District of Columbia,\n217 F.R.D. 43; 2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 13884, (2003), the plaintiffs challenged the District of\nColumbia, Department of Correction’s policy of strip searching inmates upon reku’ning from\ncourt to jail with court orders entitling them to be released. In determining that the plaintiffs’\nhad satisfied the commonality requirement of Rtde 23(a), the court stated that :\nRegardless of the potential variation of individual circumstances of each inmate’s\nreturn, the challenged activity-strip searching- is common to all putative class\nmember. The question of whether defendant’s policy of strip searching violates\nthe Constitution raises questions of law and fact that are common to the class.\nWhen the cause of action arises out of a course of conduct that affects a group of\npersons, one or more elements of the cause of action will be common to the entire\ngroup. Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 34 (quoting Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg,\nNewberg On Class Actions Sect. 3.10 (42 ed., 2002). In this case, as with the\nother detention class, the question of causation will be the same for all plaintiffs,\nbecause it is the same course of conduct that allegedly injured each plaintiff.\nThe common questions of law and fact in the present case are as follows:\nA. Whether the defendants admitted policy and practice of strip searching all\nmale inmates without reasonable suspicion that the inmate is concealing a weapon or other\ncontraband, with judicial discharges upon their return to the Jail violates the Fourth or Fourteenth\nAmendments.\nB. Whether female inmates returning to the Jail with judicial discharges are\nsimilarly situated to male inmates returning to the jail with judicial discharges.\n6\n\nC. Typicality\nTypicality determines whether a sufficient relationship exists between the injury to the\nnamed plaintiff and the conduct affecting the class, so that the court may properly attribute a\ncollective nature to the challenged conduct. General Telephone Company of Southwest v.\nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 152 (1982). When it is alleged that the same unlawful conduct was\ndirected at or affected both the named plaintiff and the class sought to be represented, the\ntypicality requiremem is met irrespective of varying fact patterns which underlie individual\nclaims. Id; see also Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2s 931,936-937 (2~d Cir. 1998); Baby Neal ex tel\nKanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3~ Cir. 1994). Courts should look to the elements of the cause\nof action that the class representative must prove in order to establish the defendant’s liability. If\nthey are substantially the same as those needed to be proved by the class members’ claims, the\nrepresentative’s claim is typical. Johns v. DeLeonardis, 145 F.R.D. 480, 483 (N.D. Ill. 1992).\nFor example, inPatrylcus v. Gomilla, 121 F.ILD. 357 (N.D. Ill. 1988), the plaintiffs\nbrought a class action complaint alleging that government officers violated their civil rights. The\ncomplaint alleged that police and state officials busted into a bar frequented by homosexual and\nbisexual men, without warrants for any class members nor probable cause, and forced class\nmembers to lie face down on the floor for several hours, subjected them to unnecessary searches\nand photographs, compelled the class members to reveal detailed personal information and\nsubjected the class members to homosexual slurs. The court certified a class because the claims\nasserted on behalf of all potential class members arose from the same course of conduct and were\nbased upon the same legal theories, Id. at 362. According to the court, the fact that defendants\nhypothetically may assert individualized defenses, or that some class might not be homosexual or\n7\n\nbisexual, has no bearing on the issue of typicality. Id. The court needed only to determine if the\nnamed representatives’ claims had the same essential characteristics as the claims of the other\nmembers of the class. Id.\nHere, the Plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the class. The defendants admit that\nthe named plaintiffs, Quentin Bullock and Jack Reid, were strip searched pursuant to the\nchallenged policy and practice after court appearances where they wcrc found not guilty. (Def.\nAnswer Amend. Compl. pars. 7, 8, 10, &l 1). The Plaintiff has adequately demonstrated that\ntypicality is satisfied in this case.\nD.    Adequacy of representation\nThe two factors that are universally recognized as the guidelines for adequate\nrepresentation are: 1) the representative must not have interests antagonistic to or conflicting\nwith the interests of the class, and 2) the representative must appear able to prosecute the action\nvigorously tlu’ough qualified counsel. Newberg on Class ~4ctions, Sec. 3,22, p. 3-126. See also\nPrudential, 148 F.3d at 312; ,4mchen Products, Inc. V. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591,626, n. 20, 117\nS.Ct. 2231 (1997). In re United Energy Corp. Solar Power Modules Tax Shelter Invs. Sees.\nLitig., 122 F.R.D. 251,257 (C.D. Cal. 1988) (holding that the plaintiffs were adequate\nrepresentatives for the class where they expressed an interest in and understanding of the case\nand participated in depositions) .. The party opposing a class has the burden to establish that\nrepresentation is inadequate. Lewis v. Curtis, 671 F.2d 779, 788 (3’d Cir, 1982), cert. denied,\n459 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 176 (1982).\nPlaintiffs are adequate representatives of the putative class. The plaintiffs have no interest\n\nwhich are adverse to the class. The named plaintiffs each were strip searched pursuant to the\ndefendants’ policy and practice, without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion after\nbecoming eligible for release upon a judicial finding of not guilty. Counsels for the plaintiffs are\nexperienced civil fights attorneys with experience in complex class action litigation. Thomas\nMorrissey has been class counsel in Portis v. City of Chicago, No. 02 C 3139 (Judge Gettleman);\nThompson, et al. v. Oty of Chicago, No. 01 C 6916, 2002 U.S. Dis. LEXIS 10627 (Magistrate\nJudge Nolan); Gary et aL, v. Sheahan, No. 96 C 7294 (Judge Coar); Watson et at, v. Sheahan,\nNo. 94 C 6891 (Judge Bucklo); Hvorcik et at v. Sheahan, 92 C 7324 (Judge Shadur). Robert H.\nFarley, Jr., has been class counsel in Portis and Gary.\n2. Plaintif~ have establi.~hed that the (cid:128)las~ action is maintainable pursuant to\nRule 23(b)(3).\nRule 23 (b) (3) permits a class action where \"the court finds that the questions of law or\nfact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and\nefficient adjudication of the controversy.\" Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23 (b) (3). \"The predominance\nrequirement is generally satisfied where a ’common nucleus of operative facts’ exists among all\nclass members for which the law provides a remedy.\" Chandler v. Southwest Jeep-Eagle, Inc.,\n162 F.R.D. 302, 310 (N.D. I11. 1995). \"Once this basic determination has been made, the fact\nthat there may be individual questions, as proposed by defendant, will not defeat the\npredominating common question.\" Miner v. Gillette Company, 428 N.E.2d 478, 485 (I11. 1981).\nSee also Zinberg v. Washington Bancorp, lnc., 138 F.R.D. 397, 410 (D.N.J. 1990) (\"Where all\nclass members are united in their desire to establish the defendants’ complicity and liability,\n9\n\nindividual issues, if they exist, are secondary.\").\nThe requirements of Rule 23 (b) (3) are easily met in this case. As set forth above for\ncommonality, at a minimum, the issue as to whether members of the class were unlawfuIly strip\nsearched aRer court appearances making them eligible for release (and thereby deprived of their\nrights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments) is common to all putative class members,\nand this question is the overriding and predominant issue applicable to all putative class\nmembers. Even if there are, arguendo, other questions affecting only individual members, no\nsuch questions would predominate over the common class questions. A class action is also\nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\nDenying a class and requiring hundreds of individual actions would waste judicial resources, may\nlead to duplicative and inconsistent rulings, and would cause a financial hardship for the class\nmembers if they were all required to prosecute individual actions.\nCONCLIJSION\nWherefore, for the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs requests that this Court enter an Order\ncertifying this action as a class action, certifying the plaintiffs as representatives of the class\ndefined herein, and designating their attorneys, Thomas O.

Defendants.  )   \n \nCLASS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nThis settlement agreement is entered into by all parties to this \naction through their respective undersigned counsel to resolve all mat-\nters at issue in this action. \nRECITALS  \n1.  Nature  of  litigation.  On  February  12,  2004,  plaintiffs \nfiled the above captioned action, for themselves and all others similarly \nsituated, in the United States District Court for the Northern District \nof Illinois alleging violations of their rights under the Fourth and Four-\nteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Title 42 \nU.S.C. Sections 1983 and 1988. The plaintiffs allege that they were \nstrip searched upon being returned to the jail for out-processing follow-\ning a court ruling which warranted their release from Jail.    \n-1- \n \n\nCase: 1:04-cv-01051 Document #: 461 Filed: 11/16/10 Page 5 of 33 PageID #:9298\n2.  Class Certification. Pursuant to the Court's order of June \n15, 2005, the instant  case is proceeding as a class action for: \nAll male inmates who, on or after February 12, 2002, have been \nsubjected to defendant’s policy and practice of strip searching a \nmale inmate upon his return to the jail following a court appear-\nance at which court appearance a specific case or charge against \nthe inmate was dismissed when no other cases, charges, warrants \nor holds were pending against that inmate which warranted that \ninmate’s continued detention at the jail.  \n3.  Important Rulings. On July 30, 2008, the Court initially \ngranted Plaintiffs summary judgment for liability with respect to the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendment strip search claims and denied De-\nfendants motion for summary judgment. On February 27, 2009, the \nCourt granted Defendants motion for reconsideration and set aside its \norder granting summary judgment.    \n4.  Settlement Process. During the pendency of defendants’ \nappeal on Eleventh Amendment issues, counsel for the parties partici-\npated  in  the  Settlement  Conference  Program  of  the  United  States \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. With the assistance of Joel N. \nShapiro, Senior Conference Attorney, counsel for the parties discussed \nthe outline of a proposed resolution of this case. Counsel thereafter re-\nnewed the settlement dialogue and agreed to a proposed settlement. \nThis proposal was presented to the Cook County Board and approved \nby the Board after further negotiations between the parties. The pro-\n-2- \n \n\nCase: 1:04-cv-01051 Document #: 461 Filed: 11/16/10 Page 6 of 33 PageID #:9299\nposed settlement takes into account the risks, delay and difficulties in-\nvolved in establishing a right to recovery in excess of that offered by \nthis settlement and the likelihood that the litigation will be further \nprotracted.  \n5.  Certification by Class Counsel: Class Counsel have in-\nvestigated the facts and the applicable law and believe that it is in the \nbest interest of the class to enter into this Settlement Agreement.  \n6.  Denial of Liability: Cook County and Sheriff vigorously \ncontest each and every claim in the Action. Cook County and Sheriff \nmaintain that they have consistently acted in accordance with govern-\ning laws at all times. Cook County and Sheriff vigorously deny all of \nthe material allegations set forth in the Action. Cook County and She-\nriff nonetheless have concluded that it is in their best interest that the \nAction be settled on the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipula-\ntion. Cook County reached this conclusion after considering the factual \nand legal issues in the Action, the substantial benefits of a final resolu-\ntion of the Action, the expense that would be necessary to defend the \nAction through trial and any appeals that might be taken, the benefits \nof disposing of protracted and complex litigation, and the desire of Cook \nCounty to conduct its business unhampered by the distractions of con-\ntinued litigation.  \n-3- \n \n\nCase: 1:04-cv-01051 Document #: 461 Filed: 11/16/10 Page 7 of 33 PageID #:9300\n7.  As a result of the foregoing, Cook County and Sheriff enter \ninto this Stipulation without in any way acknowledging any fault, lia-\nbility, or wrongdoing of any kind. Neither this Stipulation, nor any of \nits terms or provisions, nor any of the negotiations or proceedings con-\nnected with it, shall be construed as an admission or concession by \nCook County or the Sheriff of the truth of any of the allegations made \nin the Action, or of any liability, fault, or wrongdoing of any kind what-\nsoever on the part of Cook County or the Sheriff, or shall be used as \nprecedent in the future against Cook County and the Sheriff in any \nway.  \n8.  To the extent permitted by law, neither this Stipulation, \nnor any of its terms or provisions, nor any of the negotiations or pro-\nceedings connected with it, shall be offered as evidence or received in \nevidence in any pending or future civil, criminal, or administrative ac-\ntion  or  proceeding,  to  establish  any  liability  or  admission  by  Cook \nCounty and/or the Sheriff, except in any proceedings brought to enforce \nthe Stipulation.  \n9.  Neither this Stipulation, nor any pleading or other paper \nrelated in any way to this Stipulation, nor any act or communication in \nthe course of negotiating, implementing or seeking approval of this Sti-\npulation, shall be deemed an admission by Cook County or the Sheriff \n-4- \n \n\nCase: 1:04-cv-01051 Document #: 461 Filed: 11/16/10 Page 8 of 33 PageID #:9301\nthat certification of a class or subclass is appropriate in any other liti-\ngation, or otherwise shall preclude Cook County or the Sheriff from op-\nposing or asserting any argument it may have with respect to certifica-\ntion of any class(es) or subclass(es) in any proceeding or this Action, or \nshall be used as precedent in any way as to any subsequent conduct of \nCook County or the Sheriff except as set forth herein.  \nDEFINITIONS  \n10.

'\"\"~I \nM!IlM9lW\\J!?UM  OPINION  AND  ORDER \nOn  July  30,  2008,  I  entered an  order  resolving  cross-motions \nfor  summary  judgment  in  this  action  (the  \"July  30  Order\").  At \nissue was  whether  defendants Michael  Sheahan  (then  the Cook  County \nSheriff)  and  Cook  County  violated  the  Fourth  and/or  Fourteenth \nAmendment  rights  of  plaintiffs  Quentin  Bullock,  Jack  Reid,  and  a \nclass  of  male  individuals  in  the  custody  of  the  Cook  County \nDepartment  of  Corrections  (\"CCDOC\"  or  the  \"Jail\").  I  granted \nplaintiffs'  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  claims  that defendants' \npolicy  of  performing  blanket  strip  searches  on  male  inmates \nreturning  to  CCDOC  from  court  hearings,  where  those  hearings \nresul ted  in  the  dismissal  of  certain  charges  and  there  was  no \nadditional  basis  for  the  inmates'  detention,  violated  the  Fourth \nand  Fourteenth Amendments.  In particular,  I  held that defendants' \npolicy and practice of allowing  female  court  returns;  but  not male \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 2 of 40\nt:  .\" \ncourt  returns,  to  avoid  being  subj ected  to  a  strip  search  by \nelecting to remain  in the Jail's receiving area while their release \nwas  processed,  rather  than  return  to  their  housing  divisions, \nviolated  plaintiffs'  right  to  equal  protection.  I  also  held  that \ndefendants'  policy  and  practice  of  affording  certain  privacy \naccommodations  to  female  court  returns  who  are  strip searched but \nnot to male  court  returns,  all of whom  are strip searched,  violated \nplaintiffs'  right  to  equal  protection.  I  further  held  that  the \nblanket  strip  search  policy  of  all  male  court  returns  violated \nplaintiffs'  Fourth  Amendment  rights.  I  also  denied  defendants' \nmotion,  which  sought  summary  judgment  of  non-liability  on  all  of \nclaims,  in  its  entirety.  In  particular,  I  held  that \nplaintiffs~ \ndefendants  are  not  immune  from  liability  under  the  Eleventh \nAmendment  as  a  matter  of  law,  and  that  a  material  factual  dispute \nexisted  as  to  whether  the  length  of  plaintiffs'  detention  was \nreasonable. 1 \nNow  before me  is defendants'  motion  for  reconsideration of my \nJuly  30  Order.  For  the  reasons  discussed  below,  that  motion  is \ngranted  in  part.  To  the  extent  the  motion  is  granted,  on \nreconsideration,  I  resolve  the  parties'  cross-motions  for  summary \njudgment  as  set  forth  below. \nlThe  July  30  Order  stated  that  both  sought  parties  summary \njudgment  on  the  issue  of  unreasonable  delay.  In  fact,  only \ndefendants  sought  summary  judgment  on  this  issue. \n2 \n\n.'  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 3 of 40\nI. \nAt  the  outset,  I  feel  compelled  to  note  that  ascertaining \nwhich  facts  are  genuinely  in  dispute  in  this  matter  has  been \ncomplicated by  the manner  in  which  the  parties handled  their Local \nRule  56.1  submissions.  Instead  of  setting  forth,  and  responding \nto,  short  factual  statements  as  the  Rule  requires,  the  parties \napproached · their  filings  as  a  platform  for  advancing  competing \ncharacterizations  of  the  evidence  and  for  highlighting  their \nrespective  experts'  opinions.  Defendants,  in  particular,  packed \nmultiple,  often  conclusory  assertions  and  opinions  into  each \nfactual  \"statement,\" followed by a  string cite to various portions \nof  the  record.  Plaintiffs  (and  I)  were  then  faced with  the burden \nof  trying  to  match  up  the  various  propositions  in  each  numbered \nstatement with  the  corresponding citations and determining whether \nthe  statements  were,  in  fact,  supported  by  the  evidence.  This \napproach  flies  in  the  face  of  both  the  letter  and  the  spirit  of \nL.R.  56.1. \nIn  addition,  defendants  typically  responded  to  plaintiffs' \nstatements  with  their  own  \"undisputed\"  version  of  the  same  or \nrelated  facts,  which  recharacterized,  amended,  or  added  to  the \nfacts  plaintiffs  set  forth.  This  type  of  response  is  obviously \nunacceptable,  as  it fails  to  respond to plaintiffs'  facts  and also \nintroduces  new  facts  that  plaintiffs  have  no  means  of \ncontroverting.  If defendants  cannot  dispute  plaintiffs'  properly \n3 \n\n•  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 4 of 40\nsupported  facts,  they  must  admit  them.  To  the  extent  defendants \nwish to convey that plaintiffs'  facts,  although undisputed,  fail to \ntell  the  whole  story,  defendants  may  add,  in  a  separate  numbered \nstatement,  whatever  factual  material  they  believe  is  necessary  to \ncomplete  the picture.  That  is  the  purpose  of L.R.  56.1(b) (3)©.  I \nremind  both  parties  (for  plaintiffs,  while  generally  more \nrestrained  in  their  factual  statements,  were  not  immune  from \nnarrative,  non-responsive,  argumentative  responses)  that  I  am \nentitled  to  demand  strict  adherence  to  L.R.  56.1,  and  that  I  may \nrefuse  to  consider  facts  presented  in  a  fashion  inconsistent  with \nthe  rule.  Ciomber v.  Cooperative  Plus,  Inc.,  527  F.3d 635,  643  (7th \nCir.  2008). \nWith this introduction,  r  turn to the  facts.  A short glossary \nof  terms  is useful  to begin.  Throughout  this opinion,  I  refer  to \ninmates  who  return  to  the  Jail  after  an  appearance  in  court  as \n\"court  returns.\"  r  refer  to  court  returns  whose  appearance \nculminates  in  the  issuance  of  a  mittimus  dismissing  particular \ncharges  against  them  as  \"possible  discharges.\"  I  refer  to  the \nmittimus  itself  as  a  \"dismissal  mittimus.\"'  A possible  discharge \nbecomes an  \"actual discharge\"  if the Sheriff determines,  based upon \n2r \nnote  that  the  parties use  various  terms  to  refer  to  such  a \nmittimus,  including,  for  example,  \"court  ordered  release,\"  and \n\"court  ordered  discharge.\"  I  am  mindful  that  a  mittimus  does  not \norder  or  effect  an  inmate's  release  but  rather  dismisses  certain \ncharges  against  the  inmate,  and  I  have  chosen  the  term  \"dismissal \nmittimus\"  to  reflect  this  distinction. \n4 \n\n. \n,  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 5 of 40\na  review of the  inmate's  records by CCDOC  staff,  that the  inmate  is \nnot  subject  to  any  additional  charges,  warrants,  or  holds  and  may \ntherefore  be  released. \nThe parties agree  that as  of March  2008,  the Jail housed  9,165 \ninmates.  Of  these,  8,436 were male  and 729  were  female--a  ratio of \napproximately nine  to one.  CCDOC  inmates  live in one  of the Jail's \nten housing divisions,  each of which operates semi-autonomously and \nhas  its  own  separate  building  on  the  Jail  grounds.  Eight  of  the \ndivisions  are  for  men,  and  two  are  for  women.  Inmates  are  housed \naccording  to  their security classifications,  which  are  established \nbased  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  criminal  history,  prior \nconvictions,  prior  disciplinary problems,  known  gang  affiliation, \nany  history  of  drug  or  alcohol  abuse,  etc.  Roughly  32%  of  all \nCCDOC  inmates  (male  and  female)  have  a  maximum  security \nclassification. \nThe Receiving,  Classification and Diagnosis Center  (\"RCDC\")  is \nthe  Jail's  hub  of  inmate  movement.  All  inmates  who  transfer \nbetween  housing  divisions,  or  who  enter  or  exit  the  Jail  for  any \nreason,  including  court  appearances,  medical  or  psychiatric \ntreatment,  participation  in  alternative  programs,  etc.,  must  be \nprocessed through RCDC.  In addition,  the RCDC  is used by CCDOC  and \noutside  agencies  for  various  other  purposes.  For  example,  the \nIllinois  State  Department  of Corrections  conducts  parole  hearings \ntwice  a  month  in  the  male  intake  area  of  the  RCDC.  Inmates \n5 \n\n·.  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 6 of 40\nattending  these  hearings  are  \"staged\"  in  one  of  the  several \nbullpens  that  are  also  used  for  staging  inmates  before  and  after \nthey  attend court. \nThe parties do not dispute the physical characteristics of the \nReDe,  only  the  extent  to  which  the  premises  are,  or  could  be, \namenable  to  certain'  activities.  The  parties  agree  on  the \nfollowing:  An  area  referred  to  as  the  \"male  intake  area\"  contains \nfour  small  bullpens  identified by  letters  A,  B,  e,  and  D,  and  six \nlarger  bullpens  identified  by  numbers  1  through  6.  The  numbered \nbullpens  are  referred to  as  the  \"interior bullpens.\"  In  addition \nto the bullpens  just described,  there are five \"exterior bullpens,\" \nwhich  are  located  outside  the  male  intake  area.3  Both  male  and \nfemale  inmates  who  enter  or  leave  the  Jail,  including  for  court \nappearances,  may  be  staged for  transit at different  times  in these \nbullpens.  Defendants  assert  that  due  to  security  concerns, \n• \nhowever,  inmates  of  different  security  classifications  and/or \ndifferent  discharge  statuses  generally  are  not  commingled  in  the \nvarious  bullpens.·  Some  of  the  bullpens  described  above  have \n'I assume  that  these  five  \"exterior bullpens\"  are  the  same  as \nthose  that are  alternately referred to as  \"court  return bullpens.\" \nDefendants  also refer to  something  called the  \"bonding cage,\" also \noutside  the  intake  area,  and  it  is  unclear  whether  this  is \nsomething  other  than  the  exterior bullpens. \n'Plaintiffs point  out,  and  there  is  evidence  to  suggest,  that \ncertain  classes  of  inmates  are,  on  occasion,  commingled.  CCDOC's \nposition  is  that  although  this  is  sometimes  inevitable  due  to \nlogistical  constraints,  it  is  highly  undesirable  from  a  security \nperspective. \n6 \n\n•  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 7 of 40\ntoilet facilities while  others do  not.  The  parties disagree  about \nhow  many  inmates  can  be  held  in  the  various  bullpens. \nEach weekday,  approximately 800  to 1,200 inmates attend court, \nand  again  the  ratio  of men  to  women  is  approximately  nine  to  one. \nInmates  are  first  transported  from  their  housing  divisions  to  the \nRCDC,  where  they  are  staged  in  the  various  bullpens  while  CCDOC \ntransportation  officers  verify  and  prepare  the  inmates'  court \npaperwork.  Roughly  half  of  the  inmates  attending  court  on  any \ngiven  day  attend  hearings  at  the  Criminal  Courts  Building  (\"CCB\") \nin  Chicago,  which  is  adjacent  to  the  CCDOC  facilities  and  is \naccessed by  a  system  of  underground  tunnels.  Inmates  whose  court \nhearings  are  at  one  of  the  \"outlying\"  courts  are  transported  from \nthe  RCDC  to  the  courts  and back by  bus.  Inmates  going  to  court at \nthe  CCB  are  taken  through  tunnels  from  the  RCDC  into  the  basement \nof  the  CCB;  which  area  is  known  as  the  \"Bridge.\"  The  Bridge  is \nseparated by walls  into two  sides known  as  the  \"male bridge,\" which \ncontains holding cells numbered 4-8,  and the  \"female bridge,\" which \ncontains  holding  cells  numbered  1-3.  Confusingly,  inmates  of \neither  sex  may  be  held  in  the  cells  located  on  either  side  (but \nmale and female  inmates presumably are not commingled).  The  Bridge \nis  staffed by  CCDOC  officers  during  the  hours  of  inmate  movement \nfrom  the  Jail to  the  court.  Transportation officers bring inmates \nfrom  the  Bridge  to  the  inmates'  next  waystation--the  courtroom \nlockups--using dedicated elevators within the CCB.  The  lockups are \n7 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 8 of 40\ngenerally  adjacent  to  the  various  courtrooms  (though  some  or  all \ncourtrooms  share  lockup  facilities  with  one  other  courtroom)  and \nare staffed by  courtroom deputies,  who  take  custody of  the  inmates \nupon  their arrival.  At  the  conclusion  of the morning court  calls, \nCourt  Services'  transportation  team  takes  the  inmates  from  the \nlockups  baGk  down  to  the Bridge.  From  there,  they are  returned to \nthe  Jail  via  the  RCDC,  and  ultimately,  in  most  cases,  to  their \nrespective  housing  divisions,  following  a  procedure  that  is  at \nleast  as  complex  as  the  one  required  for  their  arrival  at  the \ncourt. \nIt should be  apparent  from  the  above  that CCDOC  has  a  complex \nsystem requiring interagency coordination for  transporting inmates \nfrom  their living quarters  within  the  Jail to  the  courts  and back. \nIt  is  also  clear  from  the  record  that  the  logistics  of  moving \nhundreds  of inmates presenting a  range of security risks to several \ndifferent  locations  requires  significant  time.  Indeed,  inmates \nwith  court \"appearances  are  awakened  between  4:00  and  4:20  a.m.  to \nensure  their  prompt  arrival  at  court  calls  beginning  at  9:00  or \n9:30  a.m.  And  at  the  end  of  each  day,  inmates  returning  from \noutlying  courts  or  from  late  court  calls  at  the  CCB  may  return  to \nthe  RCDC  as  late  as  9:00  p.m. \n8 \n\n.'  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 9 of 40\nEvery  court  return,  regardless  of  the  court's  disposition  of \nhis  or  her  case,s  is  required  to  return  to  the  Jail  before  being \nreleased.  Both male  and  female  court  returns are  transported from \nthe  courts  back  to  the  RCDC.  At  this  point,  the  procedure  for \nprocessing  court  returns  back  into  (or,  in  the  case  of  actual \ndischarges,  out  of)  the  Jail  diverges  based  on  two  factors:  the \ninmate's sex,  and whether the inmate obtained a  dismissal mittimus. \nAs  explained  below,  the  combination  of  these  factors  is  what \ndetermines  whether  and  how  a  court  return  is  subject  to  a  strip \nsearch.  The  lack  of  uniformity  between  the  procedures  applied  to \nmale  actual  discharges  and  female  actual  discharges  is  the  basis \nfor  plaintiffs'  claims. \nBefore  delving  into  these  procedures,  a  few  additional \nstatistics provide  helpful  context.  A  representative  study  using \ndata  from  2002-2005  shows  that on  average,  209 male  inmates per day \nreceive  dismissal  mittimuses  (i.e.,  they  become  \"possible \ndischarges8 although  CCDOC  physically  transports  only  170  of \n), \nthese  inmates  to  and  from  court.6  The  same  study  showed  a  peak  of \n5For  ease  of  reference,  I  sometimes  refer  to  the  disposition \nof  a  court  return's  \"case.\"  What  I  mean  in  each  instance  is  the \ndisposition of the particular charges or matter before the court on \nthe  day  of  the  hearing. \n6The  remainder  are  \"electronic  monitoring\"  or  \"papers  only\" \ninmates,  who  are  not  physically  transported  from  the  Jail  to  the \ncourt  and  back,  but  who  are  nevertheless  subject  to  CCDOC \nmonitoring  or  are  in  CCDOC  custody.  Both  numbers  are  relevant, \nsince  although  only  the  inmates  who  are  transported  to  and  from \ncourt  are  subject  to  the  challenged  strip  search,  CCDOC  must \n9 \n\n,  .. \nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 10 of 40\n291  discharges  on  a  single day  (of  whom  CCDOC  transported \npossib~e \n243).  The  corresponding numbers  for  female  inmates  show  an  average \nof  38  possible  discharges  per  day  (of  whom  31  are  transported), \nwith  a  peak  of  55  (45  transported).  on  average,  57%  of  male \npossible discharges became actual discharges.7  Stated differently, \nan  average  of  43%  of  male  court  returns  who  receive  dismissal \nmittimuses are not eligible for  release  (i.e.,  do not become  actual \ndischarges)  due  to  other holds.  The  parties  do  not  dispute  these \nfigures. \nAt all times  relevant to this  case,  the policy and practice of \nCCDOC  has  been  to  strip  search  all  male  and  female  court  returns \nwho  return'to  their  housing  divisions  after  a  court  appearance, \nregardless  of  the  disposition  of  their  cases.  It  has  not  been \nCCDOC's  policy or practice during the relevant time period to strip \nsearch  court  returns,  male or  female,  in  the  RCDC. \nAll  male  court  returns,  including  those  returning  from  court \nwith dismissal mittimuses,  are required to proceed from the RCDC  to \ntheir  respective housing divisions  while  the Records  Department  of \nthe  CCDOC  processes  their  paperwork.  If  a  male  court  return's \nmittimus  indicates  that  he  is  a  possible  discharge,  an \nadministrative  assistant  in  the  Discharge  Unit  of  the  Records \nprocess  the  rni ttimus  papers  of  all  of  the  inmates  with  court \nproceedings  to  determine  whether  they  may  be  discharged. \n7The  study  does  not  provide  a  corresponding  percentage  for \nfemale  inmates. \n10 \n\n, \nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 11 of 40\nDepartment  checks  CIMIS  (a  computerized  record  system  containing \ncase  information  on  each  inmate),  as  well  as  the  inmate's  paper \n\"record  pack\"  to  determine  whether  the  inmate  is  an  actual \ndischarge.  If so,  the  inmate  is brought back  from  his  division  to \nRCDC,  where  his  identity  is  verified  and  he  is  released.  In  the \ncase of pla~ntiffs Bullock and Reid,  this process took eight-and-a-\nhalf  and  eight  hours  respectively. ' \nThe  procedure by  which  male  court  returns  are  searched  is  as \nfollows:  (1)  the  inmates  are  lined  up  at  arm's  length  from  each \nother;  (2)  the  inmates  are  instructed  to  remove  all  of  their \nclothing;  (3)  the  inmates  are  then  instructed to extend their arms \nand  legs  apart;  and  (4)  the  inmates  are  ordered  to  squat  three  or \nfour  times,  and  to  cough  while  squatting.  The  number  of  inmates \nbeing  searched  at  once  varies;  there  is  testimony  that  as  many  as \n50 male  inmates have been searched together,  but that generally the \nnumber  is  lower. \n\"The  amended  complaint  states,  \"The  detention  of  plaintiff \nBullock  for  approximately  eight  and  one-half  hours  and  plaintiff \nReid  for  eight  hours  after  judges  determined  they  should  be \nreleased  from  custody  constitutes  deliberate  indifference  to  the \nrights of the plaintiffs.\"  It is not  clear from this language,  and \nthe  parties'  summary  judgment  papers  do  not  clarify,  whether \nplaintiffs  began  counting  at  the  time  the  judge  signed  the \ndismissal  mittimus,  at  the  time  plaintiffs  were  returned  to  CCDOC \ncustody  after  their  hearings  (recall  that  inmates  are  in  the \ncustody  of  the  courtroom  deputy  at  least  until  they  leave  the \ncourtroom  lockups,  and  apparently  remain  in  the  custody  of  Court \nServices  for  some  time  thereafter  en  route  to  the  Jail),  at  the \ntime  they  actually  arrived at  the  Jail,  or  some  other  time. \n11 \n\n•  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 12 of 40\nFemale  court  returns  are  processed  differently  upon  their \nreturn  from  court.  Upon  or  shortly  after  their  arrival  at  RCDC, \nfemale  court  returns  are broken  down  into two  groups,  according  to \nthe  disposition  noted  on  their  mittimuses.  All  female  court \nreturns  other  than  those  who  received  dismissal  mittimuses  are \nrequired,  like  their male  counterparts,  to  return  to  their housing \ndivisions,  where  they are  strip searched.  But  female  court returns \nwhose  mittimuses  show  they  are  possible  discharges  are  segregated \ninto  a  separate  bullpen  within  the  RCDC  while  the  CCDOC  staff \nconsults  CIMIS  and  reviews  their  records  to  determine  if they  are \neligible  for  release.  If  these  reviews  show  that  there  are  no \nadditional holds  on  the possible discharges,  their street clothing \nis brought  to  them,  and  they .may  elect  whether  to  return  to  their \ndivisions  to  retrieve  their personal  property,  in which  case  they \nare  subj ect  to  a  strip  search,  or  instead  to  be  discharged \nimmediately  and  return  within  thirty  days  for  their  personal \nproperty. •  The  parties  dispute  the  average  time  it  takes. for \nfemale  actual discharges  to be  released,  but there appears  to be no \ndispute that female  court returns--regardless of whether they elect \nto  remain  in  the  RCDC  or  return  to  the  hOUSing  divisions--are \n'Defendants  state  that  roughly  90%  of  women  entitled  to \nimmediate  discharge  elect  to  return  to  their divisions. \n12 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 13 of 40\ngenerally  discharged  in  appreciably  less  time  than  the  eight  and \n'o \neight-and-a-half  hours  alleged  by  plaintiffs  Bullock  and  Reid.\nThe  option  for  female  possible  discharges  to  remain  in  the \nRCDC  while  their  records  are  reviewed  and  their  release  is \nprocessed is,  the parties agree,  the  result of an injunction issued \nin  Gary  v.  Sheahan,  No.  96  C  7294,  1998  WL  547116  (N.D.  Ill.,  Aug. \n20,  1998)  (Coar,  J.).  During  that  litigation,  in  March  of  1997, \nJudge  Coar  preliminarily  enjoined  the  Cook  County  Sheriff  from \nstrip  searching  female  possible  discharges,  after  their \n~unless \nreturn  a  computer  check  of  their  record  indicates  there  are  other \nreasons  for  holding  the  inmate  or  unless  the  female  court  return \n[w] ants  to  return  to  her  living  quarters  to  recover  personal \nitems.\"  Id.,  Docket  No.  37  (minute  order).  Pursuant  to  this \ninjunction,  which later became  final,  the Executive Director of the \nJail  issued  a  memorandum  in  1997  setting  forth  the  procedure \ndescribed  above.  Around  the  same  time,  the  CCDOC  executive  staff \nlOPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  process  averages  two  hours  for \nfemale  actual  discharges·.  Defendants  raise  several  colorable \nobjections  to  plaintiffs'  evidence,  including  that  it purports  to \nbe  based  on  data  produced  by  defendants  but  does  not  accurately \nreflect  that data.  Both  parties  reference  the  underlying  data  by \ndocument  control  number  (1. e.,  \"Bates\"  number),  not  by  exhibit \nnumber,  and  I  have  been  unable  to  locate  the  data  in  the  record. \nNevertheless, .in  their  response  to  plaintiffs'  statement  of  fact, \ndefendants  cite several discharge  times  they believe are  reflected \nin that data,  ranging from  two  hours  and forty-five minutes  to  four \nhours  and  forty-five  minutes.  Thus,  although  this  evidence  is \nobviously insufficient to compare averages,  even the longest female \ndischarge  time  cited  by  defendants  is  considerably  shorter  than \neight  hours. \n13 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 14 of 40\nheld  at  least  one  or  two  meetings  to  consider  whether  a  similar \npolicy could be  instituted for  male  court  returns but  concluded it \nwould  not  be  feasible  due  to  the  number  of  male  court  returns  and \nthe  lack  of  available  space  t o  segregate  male  possible  discharges \nwithin  the  RCDC  or  elsewhere  in  the  Jail  facility. \nPlaintiffs  also  complain  that,  in  addition  to  the  fact  that \nfemale  possible  discharges  may  elect  not  to  return  to  their \ndivisions  (and  thus  avoid  the  strip search),  female  court  returns \nwho  do  return  to  their  divisions  are  strip  searched  in  more \nfavorable  conditions  than  their male  counterparts.  In particular, \nwhile  female  inmates  are  also  searched  in  groups,  privacy  screens \nprevent  them  from  seeing  one  another.  The  parties  agree  that \nprivacy  screens  were:i,nstituted  for  women  as  a  result  of  claims \nbrought in Wilkes  v.  Sheahan,  01  C 1592 (N.D.  Ill.  2001) Y  In that \ncase,  a · group  of  female  inmates  alleged  that  the  group  strip \nsearches  to  which  they  were  subjected  were  unsanitary  and \nhumiliating  because  women  who  were  menstruating  were  forced  to \nremove  their. sanitary napkins,  causing blood to run down  their legs \nand  onto  the  floor,  in  view  of  other  inmates. \n\"Plaintiffs assert that it was  this lawsuit  that prompted the \nuse  of  privacy  dividers  for  women.  Defendants  do  not  properly \nadmit  or  deny  plaintiffs'  statement,  but  they  acknowledge  the \nlawsuit  and  also  admit  that  privacy  dividers  are  used  in  order  to \nprotect  women  from  \"embarrassment  related to  menstruation\"  during \nsearches. Accordingly,  I  consider plaintiffs' statement undisputed. \n14 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 15 of 40\nSince  the  present  lawsuit  was  filed,  defendants  have  begun \nusing  privacy  screens  during  male  strip  searches  as  well.  In \nFebruary 2007,  the  Sheriff  installed privacy screens  for  searching \nmale  and  female  new  inmates  (or  ftarrestees\")  arriving to  the  Jail. \nUp  to  37  new  male  inmates  can  be  strip searched at a  time  with  the \nprivacy screens,  and approximately 200  to  350  new  male  inmates  are \nprocessed  into  the  Jail  on  a  daily  basis.  Also  since  2007, \ndefendants  have  been  using privacy screens  when  male  court  returns \nare  returned  to  their  housing  divisions  and  strip searched. \nII. \nSummary  judgment  is  appropriate  where  the  record  shows  that \nthere  is  no  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  and  that  the  moving \nparty  is  entitled  to  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law.

The  strip searching  of  all male  court  discharges  in \nlarge 'non-private group settings with up to fifty inmates \nwhile  the  female  'court discharges,  who  opt  to  return  to \nthe  housing divisions,  are  afforded privacy violates the \nEqual  Protection  Clause. \n3.

Assuming,  arguendo,  the  Defendants  are  entitled  to \nstrip  search  all  male  court  discharges,  the  manner  in \nwhich the strip search is conducted,  in large non-private \ngroup  settings  violates  the  Fourth Amendment. \nDefendants oppose plaintiffs' motion and seek summary  judgment \nin  their  favor  on  the  grounds  that  1)  the  strip search  policy  and \npractice applied to plaintiffs was  not  unreasonable;  2)  plaintiffs \ncannot  prevail  on  their  equal  protection  claims;  3)  plaintiffs' \n\"unreasonable delay\"  in discharge claims are not actionable;  and 4) \ndefendants  are  immune  from  suit under  the  Eleventh Amendment. \nA.

City \nof Chicago,  723  F.2d 1263,  1274  (7th  Cir.  1983)  (citing Mississippi \nUniversity  for  Women  v.  Hogan,  458  U.S.  718  (1982).  In my  July  30 \nOrder,  I  ·heldthat  plaintiffs  had  satisfied  the  threshold \nrequirement  of  proving  that male  and  female  actual  discharges  are \nsimilarly  situated,  that  there  was  no  material  dispute  about \ndefendants'  intent,  and  that  defendants  had  failed  to  show  an \nexceedingly persuasive justification for their disparate treatment. \nOn  reconsideration,  I  again  conclude  that  male  and  female \nactual  discharges  are  similarly  situated.  I  am  mindful  that  the \nsheer  number  of men  versus  women  means  that  it may  require more  of \ndefendants  to  develop  a  system  in  which  male  possible  discharges \nare  segregated  and  processed  separately  from  other  male  court \nreturns  than  it did  for  them  to  develop  a  system  for  segregating \nand  processing  female  possible  discharges  separately  from  other \nfemale  returns.  I  am  also mindful of the physiological differences \nbetween men  and  women.  These  distinctions,  however,  go  to whether \nany  or  all  of  the  differences  in  treatment  plaintiffs  allege  are \njustified,  not  to  whether  male  and  female  actual  discharges  are \n17 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 18 of 40\nsimilarly  situated.  \"The  similarly  situated  inquiry  focuses  on \nwhether  the plaintiffs are  similarly situated to  another group  for \npurposes  of  the  challenged  government  action.\"  Klinger  v. \nDepartment 'of Corrections,  31  F.3d  727,  731  (8th  Cir.  1994). \nThe  challenged  action  in  plaintiffs'  first  equal  protection \nclaim is the  systematic  strip searching of male  actual discharges, \nwhom  defendants  have  no  authority  to  detain,  other  than  for  a \nreasonable  time  incident  to  outprocessing.  Plaintiffs  do  not \nchallenge  defendants'  policies  or  practices  for  strip  searching \nCCDOC  inmates  generally,  or even  for  strip searching court  returns \nother  than  those  who  are  to  be  processed  out.  Thus,  the  most \nsalient  feature  of  ,both  the  plaintiff  class  and  the  comparison \ngroup  of  female  actual  discharges  is  their  discharge  status,  and \nthey  are  similarly  situated  in  that  respect.  As  to  plaintiffs' \nsecond claim,  the  challenged action is CCDOC's  gender-specific use \nof privacy dividers.  There  is  no  question  that  strip searches  are \ninvasive  by  nature,  or  that  regardless  of  one's  gender,  the  level \nof  invasiveness  is  heightened  when  searches  are  conducted  in  the \nview  of  others.  That  women  menstruate  may  justify  some  level  of \ndifferential  treatment,  but  it  does  not  alter  the  similarly \nsituated  inquiry.  Accordingly,  I  again  hold  that  plaintiffs  are \nsimilarly  situated  to  female  actual  discharges. \nOn  the  issue  of  intent,  both  parties  appear  to  believe  that \nfor  plaintiffs  to  prevail  on  their  equal  protection  claim,  they \n18 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 19 of 40\nmust  demonstrate  discriminatory  intent beyond simply pointing to  a \npolicy  and  practice  that  facially  distinguishes  between  male  and \nfemale  court  returns.  This  is  understandable,  since  many  cases \ninvoking  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  are  concerned  with  statutes, \nordinances,  or other state action that is facially neutral but that \ndisproportionately  affects  one  group  of  individuals.  See,  e.g., \nFeeney,  442  u.s.  256  (1979)  (upholding  facially  gender-neutral \nveterans'  preference  statute  that  disproportionately  benefitted \nmen);  Washington  v.  Davis,  426  u.s.  229  (1976)  (upholding  facially \nrace-neutral  employment  eligibility  test  that  adversely  impacted \nblack  applicants);  Yick  Wo  v.  Hopkins,  118  u.S.  356  (1886) \n(discharging  from  custody  Chinese  citizens  imprisoned pursuant  to \nfacially  neutral  ordinance  arbitrarily  applied  against  Chinese). \nIn such cases,  because \"purposeful discrimination is  'the condition \nthat  offends  the  Constitution.'\"  Id.  at  274  (quoting  Swann  v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg  Board  of  Ed.,  402  u.s.  1,  16  (1971»,  to \nprevail  on  an  equal  protection  claim  a  plaintiff  must  prove  not \nonly  adverse  impact  but  also  invidious  intent. \nThis,  however,  is  not  such  a  case.  The  CCDOC  policy  and \npractice  of  segregating  female  possible  discharges  from  the \nremainder  of  the  female  court  returns,  such  that  female  actual \nreturns may  elect to avoid strip searches,  is not gender-neutral on \nits  face.  Defendants  claim  that  their  strip  search  policy  and \npractice  is,  in  fact,  gender  neutral  because  all  court  returns-\n19 \n\n, \nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 20 of 40\n-male  and  female  alike--are  subj ect  to  strip  searches  if  they \nreturn  to  their  divisions.  This  simply  ignores  the  part  of  the \npolicy  that  excepts  female  actual  discharges  from  the  requirement \nof  returning  to  their  living  quarters.  There  is  no  question  that \nthe policy adopted pursuant to the  Gary injunction facially applies \nonly  to  female  court  returns.  In  this  respect,  this  case  is  not \nanalogous  to  those  cited above,  but  is more  similar to Mississippi \nUniversity  for  Women  v.  Hogan,  458  u.s.  718  (1982)  (public \nuniversity's  policy  of  admitting  only  women  to  school  of  nursing \nheld  unconstitutional);  City  of  Cleburne  v.  Cleburne  Assisted \nLiving Center,  473  U.S.  432  (1985)  (zoning  ordinance  that  required \nspecial  use  permit  for  group  home  for  mentally  retarded  held \nunconstitutional);  and  Mary  Beth  G.  v.  City  of  Chicago  723  F.2d \n1263  (7Ch  Cir.  1983)  (city's  practice  of  strip  searching  female \nmisdemeanor offenders while male misdemeanor offenders were subject \nonly  to  himd  searches  held  unconstitutional).  There  was  no \ndiscussion,  in  these  cases,  of  intent,  presumably  because  the \nchallenged state action discriminates on  its face,  and  its purpose \nfor  doing  so  does  not  affect  the  level  of  scrutiny  to  which  it is \nsubject.  See  Miss.  Univ.  for  Women,  458  U.S.  at  725  (statutes \nintended to  \"protect\" women  subject  to  same  heightened scrutiny as \nany  policy  that  expressly  discriminates  based  on  gender). \nLikewise,  plaintiffs  here  need  not  make  any  further  showing  of \ndefendants'  intent. \n20 \n\n, \nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 21 of 40\nFor  the  reasons  discussed  above,  I  again  conclude  that \ndefendants·must  show  an  -exceedingly persuasive  justification  for \nthe  classification,\"  that  the  classification  serves  \"important \ngovernment  objectives  and  that  the  discriminatory  means  employed \nare  substantially related to the  achievement  of  those  objectives.\" \nMiss.  Univ.  for  Women,  458  u.s.  at  724  (internal  quotations \nomitted).  On  reconsideration,  I  find that this  is a  question that \nmust  be  answered  by  a  jury. \nThe  challenged  policies  cannot  be  analyzed  in  a  vacuum  but \nmust  be  viewed  in  context,  taking  into  account  how  they  came  into \nexistence  and  have  evolved over  time.  That  a  portion of  the  CCDOe \ninmate  population  must  attend  court  each  weekday  is  not  a  new \nphenomenon.  But  a  significant  increase  in  the  prison  population \nand  evolving  security  issues  have  made  the  logistics  of \ntransporting  inmates  from  their  housing  divisions  to  and  from  the \nvarious  courts  in  Chicago  and  outlying  districts  increasingly \ncomplex. \nPrior  to  1992,  inmates  attended  court  in  their  civilian \nclothes,  rather  than  in  prison  garb.  In  the  event  an  inmate's \ncourt  appearance  resulted  in  the  dismissal  of  the  charges  then \nbefore  the  court,  eourt  Services  would  call  the  Records  unit  at \neeDoe  to  find  out  whether  any  additional  charges,  warrants,  or \nholds  prev~nted that  inmate's  release  from  custody.  If  not,  the \ninmate  was  released  by  Court  Services  and  was  not  required  to \n21 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 22 of 40\nreturn  to  CCDOC  at  all,  other  than  to  pick  up  his  or  her  personal \nbelongings  at a  later time.  That process  changed  in approximately \n1992,  when  the  inmate  population  of  CCDOC  experienced  a  dramatic \nincrease.  Prisoners  were  no  longer  permitted  to  attend  court \nhearings  in  their  street  clothes,  and  for  at  least  this  reason, \nthey  were  required  to  return  to  the  Jail  after court  appearances, \nregardless  of  the  court's  disposition  of  the  pending  charges. \nBy 1996,  when-the Gary plaintiffs brought their lawsuit,  CCDOC \nhad  a  written  policy,  set  forth  in  General  Order  13.1,  that \nrequired  all  court  returns,  including  male  and  female  possible \ndischarges,  to  be  strip  searched.  All  court  returns  were  also \nrequired  to  return  to  their  housing  divisions  within  the  Jail, \nregardless  of  the  disposition of  their cases.  The  Gary plaintiffs \n(a  class  of  female  actual  discharges)  alleged  that  the  policy was \nnot  enforced  as  written,  and  that  in  practice,  all  female  court \nreturns  were  subjected  to  systematic  strip  searches  in  the \nrecei ving  area  of  the  Jail, 12  while  male  court  returns  were  not \nregularly  strip  searched  at  all.  See  Gary  v.

Moreover,  the  defendant  in  Gary \npresented no  evidence  that  the  Sheriff's  standard practice  was  to \nstrip all male  inmates  returning  from  court.  The  Gary  court  thus \nconcluded  that there was  no  dispute  that  female  court  returns were \nsystematically  strip  searched,  while  male  court  returns  were  not. \nThe  court  further  found  that  for  the  purpose  of  the  plaintiffs' \nclaims,  the  male  and  female  inmate  populations  were  similarly \nsituated.  Accordingly,  the  court  held,  pursuant  to  Mary  Beth  G. \nand  Mississippi  University  for  Women,  that  the  defendant  bore  the \nburden of showing an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for the \ndiffering  treatment. \nThe  Gary  court  went  on  to  state: \nRemarkably,  the defendant does  not even  attempt to argue \nthat such a  policy is related to any important government \nobjectives.  Instead,  the  defendant  tries  to  convince \nthis court that there is no  disparity in the treatment of \nthe  male[s]  and  females.  The  women  are  strip  searched, \nthe  defendant  contends,  pursuant  to  the  defendant's \nstandard operating procedure that all detainees returning \nfrom  court,  both  male  and  female,  are  to  be  strip \nsearched.  Although such a  written policy does  exist,  the \nevidence  has  clearly  shown  that  the  actual  practice  in \nthe  Jail  has  not  reflected  this  policy  for  nearly  a \ndecade. \n23 \n\n-------------------------------------_  ....... \n......_  \nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 24 of 40\nGary  v.

The  court \ntherefore  concluded that  the defendant  had not met  its burden \nof  justifying  the  differential  treatment,  and  that  there  was \nno  issue  of material  fact  on  the  issue  of  liability under  the \nEqual  Protection  Clause_ \nThe  Gary  court  also  found  that  the  defendant's  practice \nviolated  the  plaintiffs'  Fourth  Amendment  rights.

As \nnoted above,  the parties agree that CCDOC's  current policy and \npractice  was  instituted  pursuant  to  the  Gary  court's  order \nenjoining the Cook  County  Sheriff  from  strip searching female \npossible  discharges,  \"unless  after  their  return  a  computer \ncheck  of  their  record  indicates  there  are  other  reasons  for \nholding  the  inmate  or  unless  the  female  court  return  [wlants \nto  return  to  her  living  quarters  to  recover  personal  items.\" \nThat  order  plainly  directs  the  Sheriff  to  adopt  procedures \nfacially specific to female possible discharges,  as was  indeed \nappropriate  in  view  of  the  factual  record  in  that  case. \nIt  is  clear  from  this  history  that  the  gender-specific \npolicy adopted pursuant  to  Gary was  instituted as  a  means  of \nrighting  particular  constitutional  wrongs  visited  on  female \ninmates  in a  particular context.  It is reasonable to assume, \nas  the  Gary  court  apparently  concluded,  that  a  gender-based \nclassification  was  appropriate  based  on  the  record  in  that \ncase.  See  Mississippi  University  for  Women,  458  U.S.  718  at \n728  (\"In  limited circumstances,  a  gender-based classification \nfavoring  one  sex  can  be  justified  if  it  intentionally  and \ndirectly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately \nburdened\").  Nevertheless,  even  assuming  the  policy  adopted \npursuant  to  the  Gary  injunction  was  warranted  under  the \n25 \n\n· \nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 26 of 40\n.' \ncircumstances  of  that  case,  defendants  still bear  the  burden \nof  proving  in  this  case,  on  this  record,  that  the  security \nconcerns  they  assert  justify  maintaining  a  facially \ndiscriminatory policy_  Their  burden  is  high,  but  it is  not \ninsurmountable _  Defendants  may  convince  a  jury  that  the \ndifferences  between  the  male  and  female  inmate  populations \n(for  example,  the  substantial  size  difference  as  well  as \nasserted differences  in the  nature and  frequency  of dangerous \nincidents  in  each  population),  justify continuing  to process \nmale  actual  discharges  together  with  the  other  male  court \nreturns,  despite  the  fact  that  female  actual  discharges  are \nenti tIed,  pursuant  to  Gary,  to  a  less  intrusive  practice. \nIndeed,  CCDOC  administrators have  testified that the  \"simple\" \nsolution  available  in  Gary  is  not  feasible  here  due  to \nlogistical  constraints  that  are  inseparable · from  security \nconcerns. \nI  conclude  that  the  ultimate  question  is  best  framed  as \nwhether defendants have demonstrated an exceedingly persuasive \njustification  for  CCDOC's  policy  and  practice  of  processing \nmale  actual  discharges  together  with  the  male  general  court \nreturn  population,  while  female  actual  discharges  are \nsegregated. and  processed  separately  from  the  female  court \nreturn  population.  This  formulation  both  identifies  the \nchallenged  policy  in  terms  that  affirmatively  apply  to  the \n26 \n\n,. \nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 27 of 40\n-.: \nplaintiff  class  (rather  than  by  negative  reference  to  the \npolicy  applied  to  female  inmates)  and  makes  clear  that \ndefendants  bear  the  burden  of  demonstrating  that  the  gender-\nbased distinction is warranted under the circumstances of this \ncase.  The  record contains sharply conflicting expert opinions \non  this  question,  and  summary  judgment  is  not  the  place  to \nresolve  this battle of  the  experts. \nFor the foregoing reasons,  the parties'  for \ncross~motions \nsummary  judgment on plaintiffs'  claim that defendants'  policy \nof  strip  searching  of  all male  court  discharges  and  not  all \nfemale  court  discharges  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause \nare  denied. \nSimilarly,  the  analytical  framework  plaintiffs  propose \nfor their claim that plaintiffs are not offered the same  level \nof privacy as  similarly situated female  court  returns  must  be \nturned  on  its head.  Plaintiffs  state  that  -[t)he  reason  the \nSheriff  does  not  provide  dividers  for  men  during  a  strip \nsearch  is because  there  was  previously a  class action  lawsuit \nabout  the  strip  searching  of  women  at  the  Jail  and  because \nthere  are  more  men  than  women  at  the  Jail.  The  first \n,,13 \nportion of this statement is a  reference to Wilkes  v.  Sheahan, \n01  C  1592  (N.D.  Ill.  2001),  in  which  the  plaintiffs  alleged \n13Plaintiffs'  Statement  of  Material  Facts  (Docket  No.  280-2) \nNo.  21. \n27 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 28 of 40\n• \nthat  the  group  strip  searches  to  which  they  were  subjected \nwere  conducted  in  abusive,  humiliating,  and  unsanitary \nconditions  that  violated  their  Fourth,  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment  rights.  Among  other  particulars,  the  Wilkes \nplaintiffs  alleged  that  although  they  or  other  women  being \nsearched were menstruating,  they were required to remove  their \nsanitary  napkins  and  perform  the  search  in  a  manner  that \nallowed  blood  to  run  down  their  legs  onto  the  floor,  in  view \nof other inmates.  Based on  the complaint,  it appears  that the \ngravamen of the Wilkes plaintiffs'  Fourteenth Amendment claims \nwas  that  the  manner  in  which  the  searches  were  conducted  was \nparticularly humiliating and abusive  to  them as  women  because \nof  their particular physiological  functions. \nThe  Wilkes  case  was  dismissed  pursuant  to  a  settlement \nagreement prior to the  issuance  of any  opinion,  so  the  merits \nof  these  claims  was  not  decided.  The  point,  however,  is that \nthe  gender-based  classification  underlying  the  policy  on \nprivacy  dividers,  like  the  gender-based  classification  that \ndetermines  who  can  remain  in  the  RCDC  during  outprocessing, \nwas  instituted to rectify specific practices that violated  (or \nallegedly  violated,  in  Wilkes)  the  rights  of  female  inmates. \nWhile  neither  Wilkes  nor  Gary  is  disposi ti ve  of  whether \ndefendants  are  justified  in  maintaining  the  gender-based \ndistinctions  challenged  in  this  case,  the  factual \n28 \n\n. \n.'  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 29 of 40\ncircumstances and claims in those cases are certainly relevant \nto  the  justifications  defendants  now  assert.  Defendants \ncontinue  to  bear  the  burden  of  demonstrating  an  exceedingly \npersuasive  justification  for  the  gender-based  classification \nunderlying  the  differential  use  of  privacy  dividers. \nNevertheless,  the  question  is  properly  framed  not  as  whether \nnot providing dividers to men  furthers an  important government \ninterest,  but  rather  whether  providing  them  to  women  in  the \nfirst  instance  did so.\" \nDefendants assert \"the objective of protecting women  from \nembarrassment  related  to  menstruation\"  in  support  of  their \ngender-based  classification.  Plaintiffs  do  not  claim  that \nthis  objective  is  unimportant,  nor  that  the  use  of  privacy \ndividers  for  women  is  insufficiently  related  to  its \nachievement.  Instead,  plaintiffs  attack  defendants·' \njustification by  claiming  that  it  \"fails  to  appreciate  that \nstrip  searches  can  be  equally  embarrassing,  repulsive  and \ndegrading  to males.\"  This  may  be  true  (as  noted  above,  this \nis why men  and women  are similarly situated),  but defendant is \nentitled to have  a  jury weigh  the  evidence  and decide  whether \nthe  added  factor  of  menstruation  justifies  differential \ntreatment.  As  noted  above,  \"a  gender-based  classification ' \n\"I  assume,  for  the  present  discussion,  that  defendants  were \nnot  independently  obligated  under  the  Fourth  Amendment  to  use \nprivacy dividers  for  either men  or  women. \n29 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 30 of 40\n..  ,t  . \nfavoring  one  sex  can  be  justified  if  it  intentionally  and \ndirectly assists members  of the sex that is disproportionately \nburdened.\"  Miss.  Univ.  for  Women,  458  U.S.  at  728.  A  jury \ncould  conclude,  based  on  the  evidence,  that  while  group \nsearches  without  privacy  dividers  are  invasive  and \nuncomfortable  to  both  sexes,  they  are  unreasonably  so  for \nwomen  who  may  be  viewed  while  menstruating,  and  that  this \ndistinction  justifies  CCDOC's  gender-based  classification. \nFor the foregOing reasons,  the parties'  cross-motions for \nsummary  judgment on  plaintiffs'  claim that defendants'  policy \nof  strip searching of all male  court discharges  in large  non \nprivate  group  settings  with  up  to  fifty  inmates,  while  the \nfemale  court  discharges,  who  opt  to  return  to  the  housing \ndivisions,  are afforded privacy,  violates the Equal Protection \nClause  are  denied. \nB.  Fourth Amendment \nOn  reconsideration,  I  have  also  revised  my  views  about \nthe  appropriateness  of  summary  judgment on plaintiffs'  Fourth \nAmendment  claims.  In  defendants'  favor  is  Bell  v.  Wolfish, \n441  U.S.  520  (1979),  which  upheld visual body cavity searches \nof  inmates--including  both  sentenced  prisoners  and  pretrial \ndetainees--after contact visits,  and which emphasized what the \nSeventh  Circuit  has  called  \"the  animating  theme\"  of  the \nSupreme  Court's  recent  prison  jurisprudence,  Johnson  v. \n30 \n\n· \n.• \nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 31 of 40\nPhelan,  69  F.3d  144,  145  (7th  Cir.  1995)  (emphasis  in \noriginal):  that prison administrators have broad discretion to \nadopt and execute the policies they deem necessary to maintain \ninstitutional  security,  and  that  judges  should  not  interfere \nwith  the  \"professional  expertise  of  corrections  Officials.\" \n441  U.S.  at 548.  The  Bell court further held that body cavity \nsearches  can be  conducted on  less than probable  cause,  id.  at \n560,  and  that  the  existence  of  less  restrictive  means  of \ndetecting contraband does  not necessarily render  the  searches \nunreasonable.  Id.  at  559  n.  40. \nBell .did not,  however,  approve  the  use  of  blanket  strip \nsearches  in any  and all circumstances,  but  instead reaffirmed \nthe  need  to  conduct  a  fact-specific  inquiry  into  the \nreasonableness of the particular search.  Prison  \"[o]fficials \ndo  not  have  carte blanche  to  institute any policy they please \nunder  the  justification of  institutional security,\"  Calvin v. \nSheriff  of  Will  County,  405  F.Supp.2d  933,  942  (N.D.  Ill. \n2005)  (citation  omitted).  Bell  requires  courts  to  consider \n\"the scope of the particular intrusion,  the manner  in which it \nis  conducted,  the  justification  for  initiating  it,  and  the \nplace  in  which  it is conducted.\"  441  U.S.  at  559. \nIn  Mary  Beth  G.  v.  City  of  Chicago,  723  F.2d  1263  (7th \nCir.  1983),  the Seventh Circuit held that the City's policy of \nroutinely  strip  searching  female  misdemeanor  offenders, \n31 \n\n•  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 32 of 40\nwithout  reasonable  suspicion  that  they  were  concealing  drugs \nor  weapons,  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment.  The  court \nacknowledged  that  Bell upheld the  strip searches  in that case \non  less than probable cause,  but distinguished Bellon factual \ngrounds,  including that the  Bell plaintiffs,  unlike Mary  Beth \nG.,  \"were awaiting trial on serious federal charges ... and were \nbeing  searched  after  contact  visits.\"  723  F.2d  at  1272.  The \ncourt  concluded  that  these  factual  differences  were \n\"sufficiently  significant  to  compel  our  own  inquiry  as  to \nwhether  the  strip  searches  conducted  by  the  City  were \n'reasonable'  under  the  fourth  amendment.\"  Id. \nThe  court  then  proceeded  to  analyze  the  Bell  factors, \nbalanCing the  severe intrusion on  the plaintiffs'  privacy and \ndignity  against  the  City's  purported  justification  for  the \nsearch.  Although  the  City asserted  \"the need  to maintain  the \nsecurity  of  the  City  lockups  by  preventing  misdemeanor \noffenders from bringing in weapons  or contraband,\"  723  F. 2d at \n1272,  the court concluded that the City's evidence \"belies its \npurported  concerns.\"  Id.  at  1273.  In  particular,  the  court \nnoted  that  because  the  plaintiffs--a11  of  whom  were  detained \non  traffic or other minor offenses--were not charged with \"the \nkinds  of crimes ... that might  give  rise  to a  reasonable belief \nthat  the  woman  arrestee  was  conceali g  an  item  in  a  body \nl1\ncavity,\"  and  that,  in  fact,  there  was  no  evidence  that  the \n32 \n\n•  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 33 of 40\n• \nstrip searches of female misdemeanor offenders had ever turned \nup  contraband,  the  challenged  searches  were  not  justified. \nId. \nIndeed,  although  courts  of  appeals  are  not  unanimous  on \nthe  question,  several  circuits  have  agreed  that  minor \noffenders  charged  with  non-violent  crimes  not  ordinarily \nassociated  with  drugs  or  weapons  cannot  be  subject  to  strip \nsearches absent a  reasonable suspicion that they are harboring \ncontraband.  See,  e.g.,  Swain  v.  Spinney,  117  F. 3d  1,  7  (l.t \nCir.  1997);  Chapman  v.  Nichols,  989  F.2d  393,  395  (loth  eir. \n1993);  but  see  Powell  v.  Barrett,  No.  05-16734,  2008  WL \n4072800  (lph  Cir.,  Sept.  4,  2008)  (no  reasonable  suspicion \nrequired).  The  hitch in  this  case,  of  course,  is  that  at the \ntime the searches are carried out on male court returns,  eeDoe \ndoes  not  know  with what  crimes,  if any,  the  inmate  is charged, \nand,  in  case  of  the  plaintiff  class,  the  answer  is--by \ndefinition--none.  Here,  it  becomes  clear  that  the \nreasonableness  of  plaintiffs'  searches  cannot  be  resolved  as \na  matter  of  law,  but  depends  on  the  jury's  resolution  of  the \nsame  factual  dispute  discussed  in  relation  to  plaintiffs' \nFourteenth  Amendment  violations.  If  the  jury  credits  the \ntestimony of plaintiffs'  experts,  several  of whom  have  opined \nthat  segregating  male  possible  discharges  from  the  general \nmale  court  return population  in the RCDC  would  not  compromise \n33 \n\n•  •  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 34 of 40\ninstitutional  safety,  it  may  conclude  that  CCDOC's  current \nprocedure  is  unreasonable.  If,  however,  the  jury  credits \ndefendants'  witnesses,  and determines  that the  Jail officials \nare  within  their discretion  to  execute  the  current  procedure \nas necessary to institutional security,  it could conclude that \nthe  searches are  reasonable,  notwithstanding that some  of  the \ninmates  searched will  ultimately be  determined to have  had no \ncharges  pending  at  the  time  of  the  search. \nMary  Beth  G.  does  not  preclude  the  latter  of  these \npotential  outcomes.  Although  the  court  determined  in  that \ncase  that  the  City  of  Chicago  lacked  reasonable  suspicion  as \nto  female  misdemeanor  offenders  as  a  class,  it did  not  go  so \nfar  as  to hold that individualized reasonable  suspicion as  to \neach  detainee  was  required,  and  implicitly acknowledged  that \nreasonable  suspicion  may  exist  as  to  other  classes  of \noffenders  (such  as  those  charged  with  prostitution,  assault, \nor  narcotics  violations,  723  F.2d  at  1273).  Accordingly,  if \na  jury  finds  that  security  considerations  prevent  the \nsegregation  of  actual  discharges  before  they  return  to  their \ndivisions,  it  could  also  conclude  that  the  blanket  searches \nwere  reasonable,  based  on  reasonable  suspicion  as  to  some  or \nall of  the  remaining  court  returns. \nFor the foregoing reasons,  the parties'  cross-motions for \nsummary  judgment  on plaintiffs'  claim that defendants'  policy \n34 \n\n•  •  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 35 of 40\nof strip searching of all male  court discharges not based upon \nreasonable  suspicion  that  they  are  concealing  contraband \nviolates  the  Fourth Amendment  is denied. \nPlaintiffs'  claim  that  the  manner  in  which  the  strip \nsearch  is  conducted,  in  large  non-private  group  settings, \nviolates  the  Fourth  Amendment,  is  also  inappropriate  for \nsummary  judgment.  As  plaintiffs'  formulation  of  the  claim \nindicates,  lack  of  privacy  is  their  primary  complaint. \nPlaintiffs  rely  on  two  cases  for  the  proposition  that  strip \nsearches must  respect  individual privacy:  Campbell  v.  Miller, \n499  F.3d 711  (7th  Cir.  2007),  and Hills v.  Bogans,  735  F.2d 391 \n(lOth  Cir.  1984).  While  it  is  true  that  in  each  of  these \ncases,  the  appeals  court held that manner  in which  the  search \nwas  conducted  unreasonably  invaded  the  arrestee's.  privacy, \nneither  case  supports  judgment  of  plaintiffs'  claim  as  a \nmatter  of  law.  Setting  aside  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff  in \nCampbell was  searched incident to his arrest,  and not while he \nwas  in  j ail  (the  court  noted  that  this  distinction  was \nrelevant),  Campbell  addressed  a  visual  body  cavity  search \nconducted  in  the  arrestee's  friend's  backyard,  in  plain  view \nof  onlookers.  In  Hills,  an  arrestee  was  taken  to  a  \"lobby \narea\" of the  jail,  in which  ten or twelve people,  none  of whom \nwas  involved in the  search,  were milling about,  then forced to \nface  the w~ll and drop  his  pants  and  undershorts  for  a  visual \n35 \n\n•  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 36 of 40\n• \ninspection  of  his  buttocks .  One  element  that  immediately \n--\n. \ndistinguishes  both  Campbell  and  Hill  is  that  the  viewing \npublic  in those  cases was  not  limited,  as  it is in this  case, \nto other  inmates  also being  searched,  but  included passers-by \n(Campbell)  or  anyone  who  happened  to  be  in  the  jail's \"lobby \narea\"  (Hills). \nDefendants,  for  their  part,  cite  to  Thompson  v.  Souza, \n111  F.3d  694  (9th  Cir.  1997),  and  Elliot  v.  Lynn,  38  F.3d  188 \n(5th  Cir.  1994),  for  the  proposition  that  strip  searches \nconducted in  front  of other inmates  are permissible  under  the \nFourth  Amendment,  and  Farmer  v.  Perrill,  288  F.3d  1254  (lOth \nCir.  2002),  for  the  proposition  that  whether  legitimate \npenological objectives  justify a  strip search  in an  open  area \nin  view  of  other  inmates  is  a  fact-sensi ti ve  issue.  In \nresponse  to  the  Farmer  defendants'  argument  that  the  lower \ncourt's  denial  of  summary  judgment  erroneously  placed  the \nburden  on  the  defendants  to  justify  their  policy  (the  same \nargument  defendants  raise here),  the  court upheld the  denial, \nstating,  \"Defendants  proffered  evidence  of  their \njustification,  the  plaintiff disputed  that  evidence,  and  the \ndistrict  judge  found  that the matter  could not be  resolved at \nthe  summary  judgment  stage.  That  is  all.\"  288  F.3d at  1261. \nThe  situation  in  this  case  is  similar.  As  defendants' \ncases  demonstrate,  the  Constitution  clearly does  not  require \n36 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 37 of 40\n• \nstrip  searches  to  be  conducted  in  a  manner  that  allows  only \nthe prison officials conducting the search to view the inmate. \nPlaintiffs  do  not  claim  that  a  strip  search  conducted  in  a \nmanner  that  allows  the  inmates  being  searched  to  view  each \nother  is  per  se  unreasonable.  Plaintiffs  make  much  of  the \nfact  that  in  2007,  during  the  pendency  of  this  lawsuit, \ndefendants  instituted  the  use  of  privacy  screens  for  male \ngroup  strip  searches,  and  argue  that  this  demonstrates \ndefendants  had  no  justification  for  not  using  them  earlier. \nBut  this  argument  misses  the  point.  As  discussed  above, \nprison  officialS  are  not  required  to  choose  the  least \nrestrictive means  of achieving their objective of maintaining \norder  and  safety  within  the  institution.  Moreover,  granting \nsummary  judgment based on CCDOC's  later use of privacy screens \nraises  a  significant  public  policy  concern.  AS  the  Eighth \nCircuit  noted  in  Klinger  v.  Department  of Corrections, \n(P]rison  officials  would  be  far  less  willing  to \nexperiment  and  innovate  at  an  individual  institution \nknowing  that  a  federal  court  could  impose  liability  on \nthe basis of a  program comparison.  Indeed,  inmates would \nsuffer  because  officials  would  likely  provide  each \ninstitution  with  the  bare  constitutional  minimum  of \nprograms  and  services  to  avoid  the  threat  of  equal \nprotection  liability. \n31  F.3d 727,  733  (8<h  Cir.  1994).  Similarly here,  if each time \neCDOC  improved  upon  the  conditions  for  conducting  inmate \nsearches,  a  court could impose  liability based on  CCDOC's  pre-\nimprovement procedures,  ceDoe would have  a  perverse  incentive \n37 \n\n, \nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 38 of 40\nnot  to seek  improvements,  and  to  conduct  searches  in a  manner \nthat  minimally  meets  constitutional  standards,  even  where \nimprovements  are  feasible.  Of  course,  the  jury may  consider \nevidence  of  these  improvements  in  weighing  the  parties' \nrespective  positions;  but  it  does  not  entitle  plaintiffs  to \nprevail  as  a  matter  of  law. \nFor the foregoing reasons,  the parties'  cross-motions for \nsummary  judgment on plaintiffs'  claim that the manner  in which \nthe  strip  search  is  conducted,  in  large  non-private  group \nsettings,  violates  the  Fourth  Amendment  are  denied. \nAs  to  plaintiffs'  Fourth  Amendment  claim  based  on \nunreasonable delay,  although defendants'  Rule 54(b)  motion  for \nreconsideration  seeks  to  vacate  the  entirety  of  the  July  30 \nOrder,  defendants  do  not  argue  any  basis  for  revisiting  my \ndisposi tion  of  this  claim.  Motions  for  reconsideration- \nregardless of whether brought under Rule  54(b)  or Rule  59(e)- \nserve  a  limited function,  and are  appropriate  only to correct \nmanifest  errors  of  law  or  fact  or  to present newly discovered \nevidence.  Rothwell  Cotton  Co.  V.  Rosenthal  Co.,  827  F.2d \n~ \n246,  251  (7,h Cir.  1987) (quoting Keene Corp.  v.  Int'l Fid.

As  defendants  have  not \nasserted  that  any  of  these  grounds  applies  to  my  denial  of \n38 \n\n. .  ,  Case 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 39 of 40\n~~ \nsummary  judgment  in  their  favor  on  plaintiffs'  unreasonable \ndelay  claim,  I  decline  to  reconsider  that  denial.  In  any \nevent,  I  am  convinced  that  pursuant  to  Chortek  v.  City  of \nMilwaukee,  356  F.3d  740,  747  (7th  Cir.  2004)  (\"[T]he \nreasonableness  of  a  length  of  detention  typically  'is  a \nquestion  best  left  open  for  juries  to  answer  based  on  the \nfacts  presented  in  each  case' \"),  summary  judgment  of  this \nclaim  is  in  this  case. \ni~appropriate \nC.  Eleventh  Amendment  Immunity \nDefendants'  motion  for  reconsideration also asserts that \nI  erred in declining to grant  summary  judgment  for defendants \non  the  basis  of  Eleventh  Amendment  immunity.  They  have  not \npersuaded me,  however,  that  my  denial  of  summary  judgment  on \nthis  ground  rested  on  a  manifest  error  of  law  or  fact. \nDefendants  concede  that  Sheriffs  generally  act  as  county, \nrather than state officials.  That an  Illinois Sheriff may act \nas  an  arm  of  the  State  does  not  compel  the  conclusion  that \nthis  exception--rather  than  the  general  rule--applies  here. \nAccordingly,  defendants'  motion  to  reconsider  the  portion  of \nthe  July  30  Order  denying  summary  judgment  on  the  basis  of \nEleventh  Amendment  immunity  is  denied. ls \nISAs  the  substance  of my  analysis  and  the  authorities  I  cited \nmade  clear,  at  issue  was  whether  defendants  are  immune  from  suit \nunder  the  Eleventh Amendment.  References  in  the  July  30  Order  to \n\"qualified\"  immunity  should be  amended  accordingly. \n39 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 429      Filed 02/27/2009     Page 40 of 40\nIII. \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  defendants'  Rule  54(b)  motion \nfor  reconsideration is granted as  to  the portions  of  the  July \n30  Order  that granted  summary  judgment  to plaintiffs on  their \nFourteenth  Amendment  claims  and  on  certain  of  their  Fourth \nAmendment  claims.  Those  portions  of  the  July  30  Order  are \nvacated,  and  I  now  deny  both  parties'  motions  for  summary \njudgment  on  those  claims. \nDefendants'  Rule  54(b)  motion  is  denied  as  to  the \nportions  of  the  July  30  Order  denying  defendant's  motion  for \nsummary  judgment  of  plaintiffs'  Fourth  Amendment  claim  of \nunreasonable delay and  denying defendant's motion  for  summary \njudgment  bqsed  on  Eleventh  Amendment  immunity. \nEN'rlilR  ORDER: \nElaine E.

Bucklo\nor Magistrate Judge than Assigned Judge\nCASE NUMBER 04 C 1051 DATE 5/23/2011\nCASE Bullock vs. Dart\nTITLE\nDOCKET ENTRY TEXT\nDefendants’ Motion to Bar Plaintiff Reid from Taking Award [471] is granted.\nO[ For further details see text below.] Docketing to mail notices.\n*Mail AO 450 form.\nSTATEMENT\nIn March 2011, the parties in this suit entered into a settlement\nagreement.  One term of the agreement stipulated that Reid was to receive\nan “incentive award” of $25,000 for serving as one of the representatives\nfor  the plaintiff class.  Defendants   later discovered  that,  during\nbankruptcy proceedings in 2010, Reid certified that he had no legal claims\nof any value.  Defendants claim that Reid’s debts were ultimately discharged\non the basis of the latter representation, and that, as a result, he is now\njudicially estopped from recovering the incentive award.  I agree.\n“Judicial estoppel provides that a party who prevails on one ground in\na prior proceeding cannot turn around and deny that ground in a subsequent\nMedmarc Cas. Ins. Co. v. Avent America, Inc.\none.”   , 612 F.3d 607, 613 (7th\nCir. 2010).  “It is an equitable concept designed to protect the integrity\nof the judicial process and “to prevent litigants from playing fast and\n Butler v. Village of Round Lake Police Dept.\nloose with the courts.”  , 585\nF.3d 1020, 1022 (7th Cir. 2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted).  \n“Its purpose is to prevent a  litigant from prevailing  twice on opposite\nId.\ntheories.” \nReid maintains that the omission of the claim during the bankruptcy\nproceedings was inadvertent.  Except for his say-so, however, he offers no\nevidence in support of this  contention.  Reid additionally relies on the\nfact that he has recently been given permission by the bankruptcy court to\nreopen his case and to report the $25,000 payment.  Thus, he argues that his\nbankruptcy action will be modified and his previous omission of the payment\nwill not benefit him.  Once again, however, Reid’s assertions are based\n04C1051 Bullock vs. Dart Page 1 of  2\n\nSTATEMENT\nlargely on his own speculations.  Indeed, even if Reid’s contention is true\nand he ultimately does not benefit from the omission, the Seventh Circuit\nhas made clear that judicial  estoppel still applies.  As the court has\nexplained:\na debtor who receives even preliminary benefits from concealing\na chose in action from his creditors can still be estopped from\npursuing the suit in the  future.  To hold otherwise would give\ndebtors an incentive to game the bankruptcy system.  Debtors\ncould take a wait-and-see approach to disclosure by prosecuting\nan  undisclosed claim while  waiting  to see  how  favorably the\nbankruptcy proceeding unfolds  before discharge. That approach\nwould undermine both the primary aim of judicial estoppel, which\nis to protect the integrity of the judicial process, and the\nbankruptcy law’s goal of unearthing all assets for the benefit of\ncreditors.\nWilliams v. Hainje\n, 375 Fed. App’x. 625, 628 (7th Cir 2010) (citations\nomitted).  \n     For these reasons, defendants’ motion to bar is granted.\n04C1051 Bullock vs. Dart Page 2 of  2",

Morrissey Ltd.\n10249 S. Western Ave.\nChicago, II 60643\n(773) 233-7900\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\nEASTERN DIVISION\nQuentin Bullock, and Jack Reid, individually\nand on behalf of a class,      ,\nPlaintiffs No. 04 C 1051\nJUDGE Elaine Bucklo\nVS.\nMAGISTRATE Judge Schenkier\nMICHAEL SHEAHAN,\nSHERIFF OF COOK COUNTY,\nin his official capacity\nand Cook County\nDefendant\nAMENDED COMPLAINT\nNow comes the Plaintiffs, by and through their attomey, Thomas G. Morrissey, Ltd., and\nRobert H. Farley, Jr. Ltd. and complain of the Defendant as follows:\nThis is a Civil Action for monetary damages to redress deprivations under color of law\nrights, privileges, and immunities secured under the Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution, and Title 42 U.S.C. Sections 1983 and 1988.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n(a) Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 (b) (3) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.\n(b) The Class consist of all male inmates who have been subjected to a strip search at\nthe Cook County Department of Corrections (Jail) following their return to the Jail from court\nafter there is a judicial determination that there is no longer a basis for their.detention, other than\n\nto be processed for release.\n©) The class is so numerous that joinder of all persons is impracticable. Inmates are\nrequired by the Sheriff’s Office to return to the Jail after receiving judicial determinations\nordering their release. There is a written directive at the Jail which requires that strip searches are\nconducted of all male inmates upon their return to the Jail from Court. The Sheriff’s Office, on\nthe other hand, does not strip searched similarly situated female inmate returning to the Jail after\nreceiving judicial determinations ordering their release. Plaintiffs believe that the class probably\nnumbers well over 20,000 persons.\n(d) Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interest of all class members as they\nare members of the class and their claims are typical of the claims of all class members. Each of\nthe plaintiffs is incensed at the treatment accorded the class members and will aggressively\npursue the interests of the entire class. Plaintiffs’ interest in obtaining monetary damages for the\nviolations of constitutional rights and privileges arc consistent with and not antagonistic to those\nof any person within the class. . ~\n(e) The common questions of law and fact include:\n(i) Whether the defendant has a policy and practice to strip search all males\nwith judicial discharge upon their return to the Jail;\n(iii)    Whether similarly situated female inmates with judicial discharges are\n¯ strip searched upon their return to the Jail;\n(iv) Whether the visual search of male inmates is reasonable;\n(v) Whether the defendant has knowledge of the conduct alleged herein;\n(vi) Whether the conduct alleged herein is in violation of the Fourth, or\n2\n.___/\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Title 42 U.S.C.\n1983;\n(vii) whether plaintiffs and the members of the plaintiff class are entitled to an\naward of compensatory damages.\n(f) The wrongful conduct alleged herein has been conducted generally upon all members\nof the plaintiff class in that the strip searches were conducted pursuant to a long-established pla~.,\npolicy or procedure of the Cook County Department of Corrections.\n(g) Common questions of fact and law predominate over questions affecting only\nindividual class members.\n(h) A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\nadjudication of the controversy in that:\n(i) A multiplicity of suits with consequent burden on the courts and defendants\nshould be avoided.\n(ii) It would be virtually impossible for all putative class members to intervene as\nparties in this action.\n(iii) Upon adjudication of defendants’ liability, claims.of the class members can\nbe determined by this Court.\nFacts and Parties\n1. Plaintiff, Quentin Bullock, also known a.s Robert Bullock, is a resident and citizen\nof the State of Illinois.\n2. Plaintiff Jack Reid is a resident and citizen of the State of Illinois.\n3. Defendant MICHAEL SH~AHAN is the Sheriff o~\" Cook County. He is sued herein\n\nin his official capacity. At all times relevant hereto, the defendant was acting under color of law\nof the state of Illinois.\n4. Defendant Cook County, under Illinois law, funds the Office of the defendant Sheriff,\nand is therefore required to pay a judgment entered against the sheriff’s office in it’s official\ncapacity. _\n5. On July 17,2002, plaintiff Quentin Bullock was arrested for armed robbery and\nsubsequently incarcerated in Division One at the Cook County Department of Corrections\n6. On May I, 2003, plaintiff Jack Reid entered the Jail on a felony charge and was\nassigned to Division Nine.\n7. On the morning of September 23, 2003, PlaintiffReid’s case was tried at the\nCriminal Courts Building located at 2600 S. California, in Chicago, Illinois. After a bench trial,\nthe plaintiff was found not guilty of the pending charge and the Court entered an order (mittimus)\nrequiring the Sheriff to release Mr. Reid from custody on the charges before the Court. Mr. Reid\nwas under the constant supervision of C.C.D.O.C. employees and not allowed to have contact\nwith non-employees from the moment he w~s taken from his division for transport to his hearing\nup to and including the moment he was returned to the Jail for out-processing.\n8.    On the morning of December 17, 2003, PlaintiffBullock’s case was tried at the\nCriminal Courts Building located at 2600 S. California, in Chicago, Illinois. After a bench trial,\nCircuit Court Judge Clay found the plaintiff not guilty of the pending charge and the Court\n4\n\nentered an order (mittimus) requiting the Sheriff to release the plaintiff from custody on the\ncharges before the Court. Mr. Bullock was under the constant supervision of C.C.D.O.C.\nemployees and not allowed to have contact with non-employees from the moment he was taken\nfrom his division for transport to his hearing up to and including the moment he was returned to\nthe Jail for out-processing.\n9. Pursuant to the Sheriff’s procedures, the plaintiffs were returned to Jail after being\nfound not guilty, each with the above referred to mittimus for the limited purpose of\nadministratively releasing the plaintiffs from the Jail. In order to administrative release a person\nfrom the Jail pursuant to a court order, the Sheriff’s Office simply checks their records to make\nsure that there were no additional holds on for that person, returns the civilian clothing to the\nindividual, and verifies the identity of the person prior to the release.\n10. Pursuant to the Sheriff’s practice and/or policy, after returning to the Jail at\napproximately 1:45 p.m., on December 17, 2003, Mr. Bullock was taken into a h~llway with\nthirty other inmates, and required to remove all his clothing. While naked, Mr. Bullock was\nordered by employees of the Sheriff to extend his arms and legs apart, to squat three or four\ntimes, and then to cough while squaring. Mr. Bullock was then allowed to put his clothes back\non. He.was then placed back into the same loekup facility in Division One which he had been\nincarcerated in prior to going to court that morning. He was not released from the Sheriff’s\ncustody until approximately 10:15 p.m. that night.\n11. Pursuant to the SherifFs practice and/or policy, after returning to the Jail at\napproximately 1:00 p,m., on September 23,2003, Mr. Reid was also taken into an open hallway\n5\n\nwith approximately thirty other inmates, and required to remove all his clothing. While naked,\nMr. Reid was ordered by employees of the Sheriff to extend his arms and legs apart, to squat\nthree or four times, and then to cough while squating. Mr. Bullock was then allowed to put his\nclothes back on. He was then placed back into the same lookup facility in Division Nine which\nhe had been incarcerated in prior to going to court that morning. He was not released from the\nSheriff’s custody until approximately 8:00 p.m. that night.\n12. On information and belief, the Sheriff has issued a General Order in regards to the\nrelease of female inmates with court ordered releases. The General Orders specifies that the\nwomen are not to be strip search and requires that they be promptly released from custody.\n13. On information and belief, the Sheriff’s Office has established procedures to\ntemporarily place a female inmate with court ordered releases in a holding cell while the\nSheriff’s Office checks their records to confirm that there are no additional cases or holds on\nher. As soon as a female inmates eligibility for release is eordirmed, the female inmate is given\nher civilian, her identity is confirmed by the guards and she is then released from custody.\nOn information and belief, the practice of the Sheriffis to release these women in less than three\nhours from the time they return to the Jail from court.\nCOUNT ONE\n14. Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1-13 above as paragraphs 1-13 of Count I.\n15. At all times relevant to this complaint, the defendant, as Sheriff of Cook County has\nthe duty to establish procedures and policies and to train deputy sheriffs and C.C.D.O.C.\nemployees to prevent unreasonable body searches of individuals who are in his custody and to\nensure that inmates are not improperly discriminated against on the basis of gender.\n6\n\n16. Defendant SHEAHAN knew or should have known that male inmates are subjected\nto an unreasonable strip search, and only males uniformly are subjected to.sueh a search, after a\nCourt has determined that the prisoner is not required to be held in custody any longer.\n17. Defendant SHEAHAN instituted, sanctioned, and approved the following policies,\npractices, customs, and procedures regarding the ship searching of only male individuals who are\nin the custody of the Cook County Department of Corrections after there has been a judicial\ndetermination that there is no longer a basis for their detention other than to be processed for\nrelease by the C.C.D.O.C.\nA. After the inmate has appeared in court and is returned to the holding cell adjacent\nto the Courtroom, he is la~nsported by Sheriff’s employees back to the Cook\nCounty Department of Corrections at 26t~ and California.\nB. From the time he is picked up from the Courtroom holding cell by Sheriff’s\nemployees to the time he arrives back at Cook County Jail, the inmate is under the\nconstant supervision of Sheriff’s employees and is not allowed to have any contact\nwith anyone other than Sheriff’s employees.\nC. Upon his return to the Cook County Department of Corrections at 26~ and\nCalifornia, the detainee is placed in a bullpen in the Receiving Room of Division\nFive.\nD. Subsequently, a group of male inmates from the same housing unit are escorted\ndown a corridor in the Jail and are then ordered to spread out against a wall.\nE. Pursuant to the existing policy and practice of the Sheriff, the male inmates are\nthen required to submit to the following strip search:\n\n(i) Each male inmate is ordered to remove all of her clothing.\n(ii) While naked, the male inmates are ordered to extend their arms and legs apart and\nto squat three or four times, coughing during each squat. The inmates are then\nallowed to put their clothes back on.\n18. On information and belief, all male inmates with judicial determinations requiring\ntheir release from custody are subjected to the strip search procedure as described above, despi~\nthe fact that similarly situated female inmates are not strip searched.\n19. On information and belief, the strip searches of the male inmates are conducted\nwithout regard to whether it was reasonable to believe that any contraband or weapons may have\nbeen concealed on the male inmates, and thereby constituted unreasonable searches and seizures.\n20. The Sheriff failed to establish appropriate procedures and practices to ensure that\nmale inmates are not subjected to unreasonable body searches and not improperly discriminated\nagainst on the basis of gender.\n21. The Sheri.fffailed to properly train and supervise the deputy sheriffs and\nC.C.D.O.C. employees responsible for Conducting body searches of inmates to prevent\nunreasonable body searches and to not improperly conduct body searches on the basis of gender.\n22. The strip search of plaintiffs after they have appeared in Court and the Court has\ndetermined they should be released constitutes deliberate indifference to the fight of the plaintiffs\nin violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n23. The acts and practices described above including but not limited to the fact that\nmales returning to the Jail alter receiving judicial discharges are being forced to undergo strip\nsearches whereas females in identical si,Bations are not, were made with the approval,\n8\n\nauthorization, knowledge, and consent of the defendant.\n24. Since instituting the practice of not strip searching similarly situated female\ninmates, the defendant has taken no steps to set up a procedure to temporarily hold male inmates\nreturning from court with judicial determinations requiting their release from custody, while the\nSheriff’s administrative release procedures are performed.\n25. The policies, procedures, practices and acts of defendant alleged above, violate the\nrights of plaintiffs and members of the class under the Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe Constitution of the United States as follows:\n(a) The strip searches were conducted without probable cause or reason to believe that\nany contraband, or dangerous materials would be fourtd and thereby constituted unreasonable\nsearches and seizures in violation of the rights, privileges and immunities of plaintiffs and\nmembers of the class under the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendments.\n(b) The strip searches constituted gross invasions of the fights of plaintiffs and members\nof the class to privacy and due process under Fourteenth Amendment.\n(c) The policies, procedures and practices of defendant relating to strip searches under\nthese circumstances are only applied to males and not to female inmates, in gross violation of the\nrights, privileges and immunities of plaintiff class under the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n26. As a direct and proximate result of the Sheriff’s policies, practices and procedures,\nin his official capacity, the defendant subjected the Plaintiffs and members of the class\nunreasonable body searches which were demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating,\nterrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, rel~ulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\n9\n\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray that this Court enter an order:\n1. Finding that this action should proceed as a class action under Rule 23, Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure;\n2. Awarding damages to each plaintiff and member of the class against the defendant in\nthe amount of fifty thousand dollars in compensatory damages for emotional and psychological\ndistress, anguish, anxiety, humiliation, and degradation. _\n3. Awarding plaintiffs and the class their costs and attorneys fees under Title 42 U.S.C.\nSect. 1988.\nCOUNT TWO\n27. Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1-26 above as paragraphs 1-26 of Count II.\n, 28. On information and belief, the Sheriffhas issued General Orders in regards to the\nrelease of female inmates with court ordered releases. Within these General Orders, the Sheriff\nhas promulgated procedures for the prompt release of female inmates.\n29. On information and belief, the vastmajority of similarly situated female inmates\nwith court ordered discharges are released in less than two hours area\" arriving back at the Jail\nfrom court.\n30. Defendant SHEAHAN at all times relevant to this complaint is a policy maker for\nthe C.C.D.O.C.\n31, At all times relevant to this complaint, the defendant, as SheriffofCook County, has\nthe duty to establish procedures and policies and to Irain deputy sheriffs and C.C.D.O.C.\nemployees to prevent unreasonable delays in releasing both male and female inmates fi:om\ncustody after pending criminal charges are disposed of by a court of law.\n10\n\n32. In 1994, Michael Sheahan was named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit\nentitled Denise Watson, et aL, vs. MichaelSheahan, et al., No. 94 C 6891. In that litigation, the\nplaintiff class alleged that the defendant violated their constitutional fights by subjected them to\nprolonged and excessive periods of detention after there had been judicial determinations that\nthere was no longer a basis for their detention, other than that they should be processed for\nrelease. The Watson class alleged that there was a widespread and systematic practice at the J~il\nof delaying the release of individuals after judicial orders were entered requiring the release of\nindividuals.\n33. In the fall of 1996, defendant Sheahan entered into a settlement with the plaintiff\nclass in Watson. The class included approximately 51,000 male and female inmates who were\nheld for excessive periods of time at the Jail after receiving a judicial order requiring their\nrelease.\n34. James Ryan is the Sheriff’s Chief of Operations. He has testified in a deposition\nthat although he was aware that the Sheriff entered into a settlement of the Watson class action,\nhe does not recall any procedures which were put in place for inmates after the settlement to\ncorrect the systematic problems in regards to releasing individuals aRer they receive court\nordered discharges.\n35. Dennis Andrews, is currently the Superintendent of Division One where the plaintiff\nwas housed. Previously he was in charge of the unit which was responsible for processing court\nordered discharges after the Watson settlement. Mr. Andrews has testified that after the\nsettlement, he failed to properly supervise the employees assigned the task of processing\nindividuals with court ordered releases and he also admitted that after the Watson settlement,\n11\n\nindividuals were still being held up to nine hours at the Cook County Jail after they received\norders from the courts requiring their release from custody.\n36. On information and belief, after the Sheriff entered into the settlement in Watson,\nmale inmates with court ordered releases continued to be detained at the Jail for excessive\nperiods after the courts had ordered their releases.\n37. At all times relevant to this complaint, Defendant SHEAHAN had actual knowledge\nof the widespread and systemic delays in releasing male individuals with court ordered releases\nat the Cook County Jail. He is also aware of the Jail’s General Orders which set forth the\nprocedures for the prompt release of female inmates.\n38. Although the Sheriffwas on notice of his defective procedures for releasing male\ninmates with court ordered releases, the Sheriff continued the following policies, practices,\ncustoms, and procedures regarding the processing for the release of male individuals in the Jail,\nwhere a determination has been made that an inmate:is to be re/eased:\nA. After the order of release or other appropriate order regarding a detainee’s status is\nentered by the court, the policy, practice, and custom of the deputy sheriff\nassigned to the relevant eourt room is to put that individual in a holding cell\nadjacent to the court room for an indeterminable period.\nB. . The detainee then must wait for Sheriff’s employees to pick them up from the\ncourthouse wherein they are being held to transport them baek to the Cook\nCounty Department of Corrections.\nC. Upon his return to the Cook County Department of Corrections at 26th and\nCalifornia, the detainee is placed in a bullpen in the Receiving Room of Division\n12\n\nFive prior to being returned back to his division cell.\nD. While the individual is in his division cell waiting for his release, his paperwork is\nreviewed by the Records Department.\nE. There is inadequate supervision of the employees within the Records Department\nto insure that priority is given to the processing of the paperwork of male inmates\nwho have been to court that day and have received an order to be released. The.\nvast majority of individuals returning from court each day are to be further\ndetained and do not receive a release order or an I-Bond.\nF. After the Records Department completes its review for a group of individuals, a\ncall is placed to each individual’s division with instructions that the individual\nshould be brought back to the Receiving Room. This procedure, in itself can take\nup to two hours until the individuals arrive back in the Receiving Room.\nG. Once in the Receiving Room, a fingerprint is made to ensure that the individual is\nthe proper person being released. It can take one hour or more before the\nindividual is released from the Receiving Room to the outside world.\n39. The Sheriff failed to establish appropriate procedures and practices to insure the\nprompt release of male detainees from custody after there has been a court determination that\nthere are no longer criminal charges pending against the person.\n40. The Sheriff failed to properly train and supervise the deputy sheriffs and\nC.C.D.O.C. employees responsible for processing such male detainees to prevent unreasonable\ndelays in releasing such persons from custody.\n41. The detention ofplaintiffBullock for approximately eight and one-half hours\n1.3\n\nand p!aintiffReid for eight hours after judges determined they should be released from custody\nconstitutes deliberate indifference to the rights of the plaintiffs, in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment fights not to be detained for an unreasonable time and the Fourteenth Amendrnent’s\nEqual Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution due to the fact that similarly situated female\ninmates are release from custody promptly.\n42. Despite the fact that defendant SHEAHAN has personal knowledge of the\nadministrative delays in releasing male inmates, and the unequal treatment of male inmates after\nthey receive a judicial release, SHEAHAN has failed to implement changes in the Jail’s release\npractices for male inmates.\nAs a direct and proximate result of the Sheriffs policies, practices and procedures of failing\nto promptly and expeditiously process detainees for release, plaintiff Bullock was detained for\napproximately eight and one-half hours after receiving judicial orders of release and plaintiff\nReid was similarly held for approximately eight hours. Additionally, plaintiffs lost time from\ntheir normal endeavors, and suffered great emotional pain and embarrassment.\nWherefore plaintiffs prays for an award of Fifty thousand dollars and his attorneys fees\nand cost.\n..

Illinois, Eastern Division.\nAugust 28, 2007.\n761 *761 Thomas Gerard Morrissey, ThomasG. Morrissey, Chicago, IL, for Plaintiffs.\nBernard E.J. Quinn, Hinshaw & Culbertson, Chicago, IL, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nELAINE E. BUCKLO, District Judge.\nDefendants Michael Sheahan and Cook County (collectively \"defendants\") have moved to strike and bar the\nexpert testimony and opinions of plaintiffs Quentin Bullock and Jack Reid's, individually and on behalf of a class\n(collectively \"plaintiffs\"), retained architectural expert Donald Henry. For the following reasons, the motion is\ndenied.\nI.\nPlaintiffs' two-count amended complaint alleges violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S.\nConstitution based on the defendants' alleged policy and/or practice under which male inmates, in the custody of\nthe Cook County Department of Corrections (\"CCDC\"), are subjected to strip searches upon returning to the\nCCDC for out-processing after being ordered released. Specifically, the named plaintiffs had been ordered\nreleased after being found not guilty of the charges against them. Plaintiffs also complain that female inmates are\nnot subjected to such searches and, therefore, this policy and/or practice violates the Equal Protection clause.\nMr. Henry is a registered architect specializing in the design of prisons and jails. He was retained by plaintiffs to\ninspect various areas within the CCDC, including the Receiving, Classification, Diagnostic Center (\"RCDC\")\nwhere the plaintiffs are held prior to entering the housing units and being subjected to strip searches, and to offer\nan opinion on whether there is adequate space for the construction of additional bullpens to hold male detainees\nwho have been discharged pursuant to court order prior to their release from custody. Female detainees who\nhave been discharged are allegedly placed in a holding cell in the RCDC and directly processed out of CCDC\nwithout being strip searched or re-entering the housing units. Defendants contend there is no space in the RCDC\nto construct additional bullpens to house the discharged male detainees so that they would not be required to\nenter the housing units and undergo strip searches.\nII.\nThe admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Fed.R.Evid. 702, which reads\nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill,\nexperience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1)\nthe testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable\n\nprinciples and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the\nfacts of the case.\nFor expert testimony to be admitted under Rule 702, the movant must establish that the expert testimony is both\n762 reliable and would assist the trier of fact in understanding *762 the evidence or determining a fact at issue in the\ncase. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 589-91, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).\nThe primary purpose of Rule 702 is to avoid confusing and unreliable expert testimony. See id. at 592, 113 S.Ct.\n2786; Loeffel Steel Prod., Inc. v. Delta Brands, Inc., 372 F.Supp.2d 1104, 1110 (N.D.Ill. 2005). Nevertheless,\n\"[t]he rejection of expert testimony is the exception rather than the rule, and the trial court's role as gatekeeper is\nnot intended to serve as a replacement for the adversary system.\" Spearman Indus. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins.\nCo., 128 F.Supp.2d 1148, 1150 (N.D.Ill.2001) (quotation omitted). Cross examination and the presentation of\ncontrary evidence are the \"traditional and appropriate means\" of attacking expert testimony. Daubert, 509 U.S. at\n596, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (citing Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 61, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987)).\nIII.\nDefendants do not take issue with Mr. Henry's qualifications as an expert, but the rigor of his methodology. As set\nforth in his report, Mr. Henry reached his opinions and the conclusions contained in his expert report \"[a]fter a\ntour of the Cook County Department of Corrections including the RCDC\" and reviewing other expert reports,\nRCDC and basement floor plans, the Sheriffs 2006 Status Report and charts summarizing certain computer\nrecords on male detainees. Defendants argue that Mr. Henry has not employed the same methodology as is\nstandard in his professional practice because he has not: (1) reviewed all of the written discovery in this case; (2)\nconsidered all explanatory variables for the CCDC's current design, including interviewing CCDC personnel and\nhas relied on incomplete costs estimates; (3) created finalized architectural drawings, instead of the sketches\nattached to his report, to illustrate his proposals; and (4) formally entered the sanitation area, which he has\nsuggested be redesigned, but looked into it through an open doorway instead.\nNone of defendants' objections render Mr. Henry's opinions or testimony unreliable or irrelevant under Daubert.\nSee Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 156, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) (\"no one denies\nthat an expert might draw a conclusion from a set of observations based on extensive and specialized\nexperience\"). Mr. Henry is not required to review all of the written discovery in this case in order to render his\nopinions and defendants' remaining objections are best addressed through cross-examination. Accordingly,\ndefendants' motion to strike on these grounds is denied.\nDefendants also take issue with Mr. Henry's cost estimates. They argue that his cost estimates are contrary to\nexisting law because they are either incomplete or too high and the Constitution does not require that defendants\npay excessive costs in accommodating plaintiffs. Defendants cite Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 588 n. 9,\n104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984), in support. In Block, the Supreme Court applied its ruling in Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), to determine that a jail's ban on contact visits was\nreasonably related to a legitimate government objective 00 internal security of the detention facility 00 and did not\n97 97\nviolate the detainees' substantive due process rights. 468 U.S. at 586, 104 S.Ct. 3227.\nIn this case, the complaint alleges violations of the Fourth Amendment and the Equal Protection clause 00 neither\n97\nof which are addressed in the holding in Block. Accordingly, defendants' argument is misplaced. In order to\n763 establish unreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, courts must balance the constitutional *763 rights of\nthe detainee with the interests of the detention facility. In doing so, courts consider four factors; (1) the scope of\nthe particular intrusion; (2) the manner in which it is conducted; (3) the place in which it is conducted; and (4) the\njustification for initiating it. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Under the Equal Protection clause, disparity in\ntreatment among similarly situated individuals based on gender survives judicial scrutiny \"only by showing at\nleast that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means\nemployed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\" Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723\nF.2d 1263, 1273-74 (7th Cir.1983) (quotations omitted). Mr. Henry's testimony is not contrary to Fourth\nAmendment or Equal Protection jurisprudence and, therefore, is admissible.\n\nIV.\nFor the foregoing reasons, defendants' motion to strike is denied.\nENTER ORDER.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Driscoll, Jr., Cook\nCounty State's Attorney, Patrick Malone Blanchard, State's Attorney of Cook County, Chicago, IL, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nELAINE E. BUCKLO, District Judge.\nDefendants Michael Sheahan and Cook County (collectively \"defendants\") have moved to strike certain portions\nof plaintiffs Quentin Bullock and Jack Reid's (collectively \"plaintiffs\") motion for summary judgment. For the\nfollowing reasons, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\nI.\nPlaintiffs' amended complaint alleges violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S.\nConstitution based on the defendants' alleged policy and/or practice under which male inmates, in the custody of\nthe Cook County Department of Corrections (\"CCDC\"), are subjected to strip searches upon returning to the\nCCDC for out-processing after being ordered released. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that\n[p]ursuant to the Sheriff's practice and/or policy, after returning to the Jail . . . Mr. Bullock was\ntaken into a hallway with thirty other inmates, and required to remove all his clothing. While naked,\nMr. Bullock was ordered by employees of the Sheriff to extend his arms and legs apart, to squat\nthree or four times, and then to cough while squat[t]ing.\n(Compl. at ¶ 10.) The complaint makes substantially similar allegations with respect to Reid. (Id. at ¶ 11.) Bullock\nand Reid had been ordered released after being found not guilty of the charges against them. The complaint also\nalleges that female inmates are not subjected to such searches and, therefore, this policy and/or practice violates\nthe Equal Protection clause.\nDefendants contend plaintiffs improperly seek summary judgment on unpled theories of liability and move to\nstrike. Plaintiffs' motion seeks summary judgment on the following four claims:\n1. The strip searching of all male court discharges and not all female court discharges violates the\nEqual Protection Clause.\n2. The strip searching of all male court discharges in large non private group settings with up to\nfifty inmates while the female court discharges, who opt to return to the housing divisions, are\nafforded privacy violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n3. The strip searching of all male court discharges not based upon reasonable suspicion that they\nare concealing contraband violates the Fourth Amendment.\n4. Assuming arguendo, the Defendants are entitled to strip search all male court discharges, the\nmanner in which the strip search is conducted, in large non private group settings violates the\nFourth Amendment.\n(Def. Mot. to Strike Ex. D.) Defendants move to strike the second and fourth claims.\nThe factual allegations contained in the complaint satisfy notice pleading standards with respect to all of the\nFourth Amendment and Equal Protection claims identified in the motion for summary judgment. See E.E.O.C. v.\n765 Concentra Health Serve., Inc., 496 F.3d 773, 779 (7th Cir.2007). *765 Nevertheless, defendants contend that\nthese claims come as a surprise because they were never addressed by plaintiffs during fact or expert discovery.\nDefendants also move to strike certain exhibits attached to plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, including\ndeposition transcripts, affidavits, and other documents submitted by high ranking officials at CCDC, on the\nground that they have not been previously disclosed and plaintiffs represented they \"had no intention of using\ntestimony from such transcripts in the pending case.\"\nThe defendants, as movants, have not provided specific evidence of any misrepresentations or sandbagging\nother than an affidavit stating that discovery did not focus on the privacy issue. Moreover, plaintiffs explained in\ncourt that the purportedly unpled theories did not require any specific expert discovery from their part, and\ntherefore none was conducted.\nI find defendants had notice of the claims and the motion to strike the second and fourth claims is denied, but 00\n97\nconsistent with the parties' representations in court on October 22, 2007 00 defendants are granted time to\n97\nconduct additional discovery on the exhibits at issue. Plaintiffs have indicated they do not have an objection to\nadditional discovery.\nII.\nFor the foregoing reasons, defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part. Defendants have until\nDecember 31, 2007 to complete discovery on the exhibits at issue and plaintiffs must provide complete copies of\nthe deposition transcripts included among the exhibits at issue.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The parties have filed cross motions for summary\njudgment.  For the following reasons, plaintiffs’ motion is granted\nin part and defendants’ motion is denied.\nI.\nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges violations of the Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution based on the\ndefendants’ policy and/or practice under which male inmates were\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 2 of 23\nsubjected to strip searches upon returning to the CCDC for out-\nprocessing after being ordered released.  Specifically, at the time\nthey were strip searched, plaintiffs Bullock and Reid had been\nordered  released  after  being  found  not  guilty  of  the  charges\nagainst them. \nThe following facts are not in dispute.  All CCDC inmates,\nincluding those ordered discharged in court, are required to return\nto the jail before being released.   All inmates returning to the\njail after  their  court  appearances  (hereinafter  “returns”) are\nplaced  in  holding  cells  located  within  the  Receiving,\nClassification and Diagnosis Center (“RCDC”) of the jail prior to\nbeing brought back to their respective housing divisions within the\njail.  The CCDC has several housing divisions which house different\ngroups or classifications of inmates (i.e. maximum, medium, minimum\nsecurity).  Each of these divisions has its own separate building\non the jail grounds.  There are two housing divisions for women.\nThe RCDC is located in the basement of Division Five and is the\nnerve center of the jail for inmate transport, as all inmates who\nenter or exit the jail are processed at some point in the RCDC, as\nwell as inmates who are transferred between housing divisions.  The\ninmates are placed in bullpens within the RCDC.  Aside from the\nsmaller bullpens A, B, C, and D, the male intake area of the RCDC\nhas six additional larger bullpens, numbered 1-6.  Some of the\nlarger numbered bullpens can house 150 to 200 inmates.   \n2\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 3 of 23\nAfter their court appearance, every inmate is given a court\norder called a mittimus.  A mittimus indicates the disposition of\nan inmate’s criminal case to the Department of Corrections.  This\ndocument indicates if the inmate is a “possible discharge.”  Among\nthe returns, the jail identifies any mittimus which indicates a\npossible  discharge  and  that  document  is  taken  to  the  Records\nDepartment.  Any inmate ordered discharged remains in custody until\nthe Sheriff determines that there are no other cases or holds which\nwould prevent the inmate from being released.  The jail staff\nchecks CIMIS, the jail’s computerized record keeping system, in\norder to determine whether a court discharge has other cases which\nwould require continued detention.  In the meantime, the returns\nare placed in the bullpens within the RCDC.      \nAs of March 2008, the jail housed 9,165 inmates.  Of these,\n8,436 were male and 729 were female.  Approximately 800 to 1,200\ninmates  go  to  court  on  any  given  weekday.    The  inmates  are\ntransported by bus to different courts.  The ratio of male to\nfemale inmates is greater than 9 to 1.  The same 9 to 1 male to\nfemale ratio applies to inmates going to court on a given day.\nThere can be as many as 5 to 6 times more men than women discharged\nfrom the jail on any particular day and on average during the year.\nApproximately 120 female inmates go to court on a daily basis and\napproximately 30 to 40 female inmates are court discharges.  The\nmale returns arrive at the jail throughout the day, commencing\n3\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 4 of 23\napproximately at 10:30 or 11 a.m. until as late as 7 or 8 p.m.  The\nreturn of male discharges is staggered over the period of 8 or 9\nhours.    \nAs a matter of practice and policy, male and female returns\nare  strip  searched  only  upon  their  return  to  their  respective\nhousing divisions within the jail, not the RCDC.  Inmates are\nreturned to the housing divisions when the transportation officers\nfrom the inmates’ respective housing divisions come to pick them up\nfrom the RCDC.  This can occur approximately every 30 to 90 minutes\nor up to two hours depending on the division.  The procedure by\nwhich male returns are strip searched consist of the following: (1)\nthe inmates are lined up at arm’s length from each other; (2) the\ninmates  are  instructed  to  remove  all  their  clothing;  (3)  the\ninmates are then instructed to extend their arms and legs apart;\n(4) the inmates are then ordered to squat three or four times and\ncough while squatting.  The number of inmates being searched at\nonce varies; there is testimony that as many as 50 to 80 male\ninmates have been searched together.      \nThe  policy  and  practice  of  strip  searching  male  returns\ndiffers  from  that  for  female  returns.    It  is  the  policy  and\npractice of the Sheriff not to give male returns who are to be\ndischarged an option to avoid being strip searched.  In contrast,\nthe jail has a specific procedure in place for female returns who\nare to be discharged which affords them the option of not being\n4\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 5 of 23\nstrip searched.  Under this procedure, once it is determined that\na female return is a possible discharge by the RCDC staff, she is\nsegregated from the general return population by being placed in a\nseparate bullpen within the RCDC.  The female return remains in the\nseparate bullpen until a computer and records check is completed to\ndetermine whether the inmate is in fact a discharge.  Any detainees\nwho  are  determined  not  to  be  discharges  are  removed  from  the\ndischarge  bullpen  and  placed  in  the  general  population  return\nbullpen.  If a female detainee is determined to be a discharge and\nelects not to return to her housing division, then the Records\nDepartment notifies the appropriate housing division that their\nclothes be brought to the RCDC.  Within the month of October 2003,\nthe average time for female inmates to be discharged was within two\nhours after returning from court.  The average longest discharge\ntime was 2:42 and the average shortest time was 1:10 for that time\nperiod. \nWhen female discharges are strip searched they are placed in\na location with privacy dividers among the inmates.  These dividers\nor privacy screens do not allow inmates to see each other during\nthe strip search.  During the time that the class members were\nstrip searched, the CCDC did not use dividers to afford any privacy\nto the male discharges.  In February 2007, the Sheriff installed\nprivacy screens similar to those used to search female inmates for\nsearching new inmates (or “arrestees”) arriving to the jail.  Up to\n5\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 6 of 23\n37 new male  inmates can be strip searched at a time with the\nprivacy screens, and approximately 200 to 350 new male inmates are\nprocessed  into  the  jail  on  a  daily  basis.    Also  since  2007,\ndefendants have been using privacy screens when the putative class\nmembers  were  returned  to  their  housing  divisions  and  strip\nsearched.  Defendants contend this is a “pilot program,” but it is\nimplemented  for  all  court  returns  and  inmates  housed  in  all\ndivisions.     \nII.\nSummary judgment is appropriate where the record shows that\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Boumehdi v.\nPlastag Holdings, LLC, 489 F.3d 781, 787 (7th Cir. 2007); FED. R.\nCIV.  P.  56(c).    I  must  construe  all  facts  in  the  light  most\nfavorable  to  the  non-moving  party  and  draw  all  reasonable\ninferences in favor of that party.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).    \nIII. \nThe class certified in this case on June 17, 2005 is defined\nas follows:\nAll male inmates who, on or after February 12, 2002, have\nbeen subjected  to  defendants’ policy and practice of\nstrip searching a male inmate upon his return to the jail\nfollowing a court appearance at which court appearance a\nspecific case or charge against the inmate was dismissed\nwhen no other cases, charges, warrants or holds were\npending against that inmate which warranted that inmate’s\ncontinued detention at the jail.\n6\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 7 of 23\n(Order dated 6/17/05, Doc. Entry # 72.)  Plaintiffs’ motion seeks\nsummary judgment on the following claims:\n1.  The strip searching of all male court discharges and\nnot  all  female  court  discharges  violates  the  Equal\nProtection Clause.\n2.  The strip searching of all male court discharges in\nlarge non-private group settings with up to fifty inmates\nwhile the female court discharges, who opt to return to\nthe housing divisions, are afforded privacy violates the\nEqual Protection Clause.\n3.  The strip searching of all male court discharges not\nbased upon reasonable suspicion that they are concealing\ncontraband violates the Fourth Amendment.\n4.  Assuming arguendo, the Defendants are entitled to\nstrip search all male court discharges, the manner in\nwhich the strip search is conducted, in large non-private\ngroup settings violates the Fourth Amendment.  \n5.    There  was  an  unreasonable  delay  in  releasing\nplaintiffs.\nDefendants oppose the motion for summary judgment and have filed\ntheir own motion for summary judgment on these claims.\nA.  Equal Protection Claim\nIn  order  to  make  out  a  prima  facie  case  under  the  Equal\nProtection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, plaintiffs must show\nthat  (1)  they  are  “similarly  situated”  to  female  inmates  with\njudicial discharges, (2) they were treated differently than such\nfemale  inmates,  and  (3)  defendants  acted  with  discriminatory\nintent.  See Greer v. Amesqua, 212 F.3d 358, 370 (7th Cir. 2000).\nDefendants argue plaintiffs cannot establish the first and third\nrequirements.  I disagree and find plaintiffs have made a prima\nfacie case under the Equal Protection clause.\n7\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 8 of 23\nWith respect to the first requirement, defendants argue class\nmembers are not similarly situated to female discharges due to\ntheir disparity in numbers (roughly five to six times more male\npotential discharges); propensity for violence; and, on average,\nlengthier criminal histories, which increase the amount of time\nneeded  to  make  a  final  determination  before  final  discharge.\nDefendants  also  note  that  men  do  not  have  menstrual  cycles.\nAccording to defendants this is significant because this bodily\nfunction  is  the  reason  given  for  providing  privacy  screens  to\nfemale discharges.  Defendants also rely on Timm v. Gunter, 917\nF.2d 1093 (8th Cir. 1990), in support of their argument.  There,\nthe Eighth Circuit found that inmates at two separate and distinct\nprisons were not similarly situated due to differences in security\nconcerns  “reflecting  differences  in  the  number  and  age  of  the\ninmates, the kinds of crimes committed by them, the length of\nsentences,  and  the  frequency  of  incidents  involving  violence,\nescapes, or contraband.”  Id. at 1103. \nMale discharges are similarly situated to female discharges\nfor purposes of the Equal Protection clause if they are “comparable\n. . . in all material respects.”  Crawford v. Indiana Harbor Belt\nR.R. Co., 461 F.3d 844, 846 (7th Cir. 2006) (emphasis in original).\nThis requirement is intended to “eliminate confounding variables”\nand help “isolate the critical independent variable.”  Id.  At the\noutset,  the  case  relied  on  primarily  by  defendants  is\n8\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 9 of 23\ndistinguishable.    Timm  involved  two  groups  of  inmates  in  two\ndistinct facilities, the Nebraska State Penitentiary - an all-male\nmaximum security prison designed to house prisoners classified as\nrequiring medium or maximum security - and the Nebraska Center for\nWomen.  The present case involves two groups of inmates within the\nsame facility.  The additional reasons set forth by defendants for\ndistinguishing between male and female discharges at the CCDC also\nfail to establish that these groups are not similarly situated.\nAlthough defendants are correct that the male inmates outnumber the\nfemale inmates, there are varying security classifications within\neach group which correspond to each other (i.e. there are both\nfemale and male inmates who are classified as “maximum security”).1\nThe statistics concerning inmate violence clearly indicate this\ntakes  place  among  female  inmates  as  well  as  male  inmates.\nMoreover,  defendants  specifically  argue  that  “low  security\ndetainees could be enlisted to help obtain contraband or weapons by\nfellow inmates,” and provide no reason why this does not apply\nequally  to  female  discharges.    Indeed,  female  discharges  are\nsubject to strip searches for security reasons upon returning to\nthe housing facilities.  Finally, underscoring the weakness of this\nargument is the fact that defendants’ primary justification for\ndistinguishing between male and female discharges is their alleged\n1There is also overlap in staff.  Division 3 (for women) and\nDivision 8 (for men) share the same superintendent and supervisory\nstaff.\n9\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 10 of 23\ninability to hold them in the RCDC while their records are reviewed\n- a logistical rather than a security concern.  Accordingly, I find\nthe  plaintiffs  are  similarly  situated  to  the  female  potential\ndischarges. \nNext,  defendants  argue  plaintiffs  cannot  establish\ndiscriminatory intent.  Discriminatory purpose “implies that the\ndecisionmaker  singled  out  a  particular  group  for  disparate\ntreatment and selected his course of action at least in part for\nthe  purpose  of  causing  its  adverse  effects  on  an  identifiable\ngroup.”  David K. v. Lane, 839 F.2d 1265, 1271-72 (7th Cir. 1988)\n(emphasis in original).  “[I]ntentional disregard of plaintiffs’\nrights  in  adopting  certain  policies  [can  be]  tantamount  to\nintentional discriminatory behavior.”  Williams v. Lane, 851 F.2d\n867, 881 (7th Cir. 1988).\nDefendants argue they have no animus toward male discharges,\nthat their motivation is simply to preclude weapons and contraband\nfrom  being  smuggled  into  the  jail.    As  already  set  forth  and\nadmitted by defendants, however, female discharges are also capable\nof smuggling contraband into the jail.  This salient fact fatally\nundermines defendants’ argument.  Accordingly, I find plaintiffs\nhave made a sufficient showing of discriminatory intent.  \nSince plaintiffs have made a prima facie case under the Equal\nProtection clause, the issue becomes what level of scrutiny is\napplicable.  Defendants argue that I should apply a rational basis\n10\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 11 of 23\ntest under Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987).  Turner held that\n“when  a  prison  regulation  impinges  on  inmates’  constitutional\nrights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.”  Id. at 89.  \nTurner does not foreclose all heightened judicial  review,\nhowever.  See, e.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 510\n(2005)  (quoting  Overton  v.  Bazzetta,  539  U.S.  126,  131  (2003)\n(“reasonable-relationship test [applies] only to rights that are\n‘inconsistent  with  proper  incarceration.’”))  (emphasis  in\noriginal); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 512 F.3d 961, 968 (7th Cir. 2008)\n(“Post-Turner, the Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny [] to\nprison  regulations  involving  suspect  classifications  such  as\nrace.”) (citation omitted); Pitts v. Thornburgh, 866 F.2d 1450,\n1454-55 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (applying heightened scrutiny to Equal\nProtection claim based on gender discrimination); Gary v. Sheahan,\nNo. 96 C 7294, 1998 WL 547116, at *7, 9 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 20, 1998)\n(Coar, J.) (same).  Indeed, gender is a “quasi-suspect” class and\nsubject  to  heightened  scrutiny.    Pitts,  866  F.2d  at  1454-55;\nAshann-Ra v. Com. of Virginia, 112 F.Supp.2d 559, 570-71 (W.D. Va.\n2000); Thompson v. Sheahan, No. 00 C 3772, 2001 WL 204774, at *3\n(N.D. Ill. Mar. 1, 2001);  Gary, 1998 WL 547116, at *7, 9.  Thus,\nwhen analyzing gender-based discrimination in the prison context,\ncourts  ask  whether  such  policies  are  substantially  related  to\n11\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 12 of 23\nimportant governmental objectives.  Id.; see also Mary Beth G. v.\nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273-74 (7th Cir. 1983).\n“[A]  party  seeking  to  uphold  a  policy  that  expressly\ndiscriminates on the basis of gender must carry the burden of\nshowing an ‘exceedingly persuasive justification’ for the differing\ntreatment.”  Id. at 1273 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v.\nHogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982)).  The classification must (1)\nserve important governmental objectives and (2) be substantially\nrelated to the achievement of those objectives.  Id. at 1273-74\n(quotation omitted). \nDefendants  set  forth  prison  safety  and  security  as  their\nimportant governmental objectives.  This does not appear to be\ndisputed.  The issue is whether defendants’ policy and practice\ndiscriminating between male and female inmates is substantially\nrelated to the achievement of those objectives.  \nThe  blanket  strip  search  policy  of  all  male  potential\ndischarges  is  not  substantially  related  to  the  achievement  of\nprison  safety  and  security  as  articulated  by  defendants.    As\nexemplified by the policy concerning female discharges, if the jail\ntook  appropriate  steps  to  identify  and  segregate  potential\ndischarges upon their return to the jail, the security concerns\nwould be addressed.  There can be no dispute that female returns\nare just as capable of importing contraband into the jail as their\nmale counterparts.  For defendants to argue otherwise would suggest\n12\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 13 of 23\nthe need to strip search female inmates is obliterated because,\naccording to defendants, the chance they will engage in violence is\nstatistically insignificant.2  The fact that there is a greater\nnumber  of  male  inmates  does  not  legitimize  the  constitutional\nviolation.  See Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 725-26\n(“The purpose of requiring [a substantial relationship between the\nobjective  and  the  means]  is  to  assure  that  the  validity  of  a\nclassification is determined through reasoned analysis rather than\nthrough  the  mechanical  application  of  traditional,  often\ninaccurate, assumptions about the proper roles of men and women.”);\nsee also Burks v. Wisconsin Dep’t of Transp., 464 F.3d 744, 751\n(7th Cir. 2006) (citations omitted) (inquiry used to determine if\ntwo employees are similarly situated does not include the ratio of\nprotected class  members to particular workforce).  Defendants’\nlogistical explanations for their discriminatory policy have been\npreviously rejected in similar circumstances when assessing their\nconstitutionality under the Equal Protection clause.  See, e.g.,\n2Defendants’  reliance  on  the  statistical  data  concerning\nspecific  incidents  in  jail  among  the  male  and  female  inmate\npopulations is faulty.  According to defendants, there is a greater\nnumber of male inmates and a greater number of incidents within the\nmale inmate population, therefore male inmates are more dangerous.\nThis reasoning is faulty precisely because it fails to control for\npopulation size.  For example, defendants set forth that 76% of all\nreported fights involve male inmates.  This means female inmates\nare responsible for almost a quarter of fights and yet make up less\nthan  10%  of  the  inmate  population  (specifically  729  in  2008).\nTherefore,  based  on  defendants’  statistics,  individual  female\ninmates are more likely to be involved in fights than male inmates.\n13\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 14 of 23\nGary, 1998 WL 547116, at *2, 9.  Accordingly, I find no issue of\nmaterial  fact  remains  on  the  question  of  whether  defendants’\nblanket strip search policy of male discharges deprived plaintiffs\nof their constitutional right to Equal Protection.  Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment is granted.  \nPlaintiffs  also  argue  defendants’  policy  exempting  male\ninmates  from  obtaining  privacy  screens  violates  the  Equal\nProtection clause.  With regard to this claim, defendants have\nfirst  failed  to  establish  there  is  an  important  government\nobjective served by failing to afford male inmates privacy screens\nduring strip searches prior to 2007.  Indeed, jail staff admits\nthere is no deterrence reason for conducting the searches this\nparticular way, nor do defendants contend that the searches are any\nless effective in detecting contraband when conducted in a location\nwith privacy screens (as is presently done).  For the same reasons,\ndefendants  have  also  failed  to  establish  that  searching  the\ndischarges in this manner is substantially related to achieving an\nimportant government objective.  Plaintiffs’ motion for summary\njudgment is granted.\nB.  Fourth Amendment\n   The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.S. 520 (1979) governs Fourth Amendment unreasonable search\nanalysis in the prison context.  The plaintiffs in Bell challenged\n14\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 15 of 23\nthe defendants’ practice of strip searching all inmates following\ncontact visits.  The Supreme Court held:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is\nnot  capable  of  precise  definition  or  mechanical\napplication.  In each case it requires a balancing of the\nneed for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights that the search entails.  Courts must\nconsider  the  scope  of  the  particular  intrusion,  the\nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for\ninitiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\nId.  at  559.    “The  more  intrusive  the  search,  the  closer\ngovernmental authorities must come to demonstrating probable cause\nfor believing that the search will uncover the objects for which\nthe search is being conducted.”  Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,\n723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983) (citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S.\n1, 18 n.15 (1968)).3  \nThe scope of the intrusion here is severe.  A strip search is\n“inherently  invasive.”    Calvin  v.  Sheriff  of  Will  County,  405\nF.Supp.2d 933, 938-39 (N.D. Ill. 2005).  The Seventh Circuit has\nreaffirmed that “strip searching involving the visual inspection of\n3Defendants argue plaintiffs do not have an expectation of\nprivacy in light of their status as inmates.  This argument is\noverinclusive as it overlooks plaintiffs’ status as discharges and\nis inconsistent with the law of this Circuit.  See Peckham v.\nWisconsin Dep’t of Corrections, 141 F.3d 694, 697 (7th Cir. 1998)\n(“[D]oes a prison inmate enjoy any protection at all under the\nFourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures? . . .\nthe answer is ‘yes’”); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1268-73 (finding\nsearches violated inmates Fourth Amendment rights); see also Powell\nv. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1314 (11th Cir. 2007) (“[A]t a minimum,\nreasonable  suspicion  must  exist  to  justify  strip  searches  of\npersons entitled to release from the Jail who are to placed in the\ngeneral jail population while their records are checked for other\ndetention orders, warrants, or holds.”).\n15\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 16 of 23\nthe  anal  area  are  ‘demeaning,  dehumanizing,  undignified,\nhumiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, [and]\nsignify [] degradation and submission.”  Campbell v. Miller, 499\nF.3d 711, 718 (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at\n1272) (alterations in original) (although police had probable cause\nto conduct a strip and body cavity search of the plaintiff, the\nmanner  in  which  it  was  conducted  was  unreasonable);  see  also\nCalvin, 405 F.Supp.2d at 938-39.  When these searches are conducted\nin public, the intrusion is considered even more severe.  See,\ne.g., Campbell, 499 F.3d at 718-19 (collecting cases).  Moreover,\nplaintiffs - as individuals for whom there is no longer any basis\nfor detention - clearly have a privacy interest which is arguably\ngreater than that of pretrial detainees.  See, e.g., Gary, 1998 WL\n547116, at *13.\n    The evidence of the manner and location of these searches\nconsists of affidavits by certain class members, attesting they\nwere searched in a large group setting in a “public hallway.”  In\nturn, defendants provide incomplete transcripts of depositions of\njail staff which provide the staff’s impressions that the searches\nare  conducted  professionally  while  attempting  to  safeguard\nplaintiffs’ privacy.  The “hallway” is an “underground tunnel,”\naccording  to  defendants,  which  connects  different  housing\ndivisions.  Defendants do concede that the searches are conducted\nin this hallway or tunnel that is used by general staff, but that\n16\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 17 of 23\nat the time of the searches the general staff is not allowed to\npass until the searches are completed.  There is no dispute that\nthese  searches  are  conducted  in  large  group  settings  and  that\ninmates  are  placed  at  approximately  arm’s  length  apart  when\nsearched.  \nDefendants’  proposed  justifications  for  conducting  these\nsearches boil down to security and administrative concerns.  As\nalready  set  forth,  defendants  have  failed  to  establish  that\nindividual  male  inmates  pose  a  greater  security  threat  than\nindividual female inmates.  Nor have they established that they had\nindividualized reasonable suspicion.  See Calvin, 405 F.Supp.2d at\n943-45;  Gary,  1998  WL  547116,  at  *13-14.    Indeed,  the  record\nreflects that none of the searches of the class members resulted in\ndetection of any weapons or drugs.  Only one class member was ever\nfound to have contraband, which consisted of two dollars.  See Mary\nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (the fact that only a few items were\nrecovered in strip searches belied defendants’ claim that policy\nwas necessary for security). \nWith  respect  to  the  administrative  costs  associated  with\nmodifying the current policy and practice with respect to class\nmembers,  defendants  fail  to  effectively  distinguish  female\ndischarges in making their arguments.  Although the number of daily\nmale  discharges  exceeds  that  of  female  discharges,  it  is  not\n17\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 18 of 23\ndisproportionate  when  viewed  in  light  of  the  jail  population\nbreakdown based on gender.  \nPlaintiffs argue there are several less intrusive and equally\neffective alternatives to the current policy and practice.  They\nargue specifically that:  there is sufficient space in the RCDC to\nhold  male  potential  discharges  until  the  Records  Department\ndetermines whether the person is an actual discharge; the jail has\nthe ability to utilize other space besides the RCDC to segregate\npotential discharges (such as the Criminal Court Building); the\njail  has  the  ability  to  identify  before  the  court  appearance\nwhether any male inmates who receive possible discharges have other\npending cases by printing out on the inmate’s court pass all future\ncourt dates which would indicate whether the inmate was a possible\ndischarge; the jail has the ability to identify after court whether\nany  male  inmates  who  receive  possible  discharges  have  pending\ncases; the jail has the ability to use Court Services to identify\nmale inmates who receive possible discharges prior to returning to\nthe RCDC; the jail has the ability to provide additional holding\nfacilities by creating new bullpens to handle court discharges such\nas  in  the  commissary  and  commissary  storage  areas  which  are\nadjacent to the RCDC and underutilized and have enough space to\nhouse four bullpens capable of holding in excess of 120 inmates\n(each of these areas would cost approximately $50,000 to $200,000\nto construct).  Defendants present additional arguments as to why\n18\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 19 of 23\nnone  of  these  proposed  alternatives  are  tenable,  which  are\nunpersuasive and in some cases unsupported by the record.  \nAlthough in Bell the Court noted that the existence of a “less\nintrusive and equally effective alternative” is not dispositive,\n441 U.S. at  559  n. 40, courts in this Circuit have found the\nbalance under Bell tipped in plaintiff’s favor in the presence of\nreasonable  alternatives  which  undermine  defendants’  proposed\njustification.  See Campbell, 499 F.3d at 719 (finding that the\nlack of evidence to suggest “any conceivable exigency that could be\nmet only by strip-searching Campbell in public” helped tip Bell\nbalance in plaintiff’s favor); Canedy, 16 F.3d at 188 (“where it is\nreasonable . . . to respect an inmate’s constitutional privacy\ninterests, doing so . . . is a constitutional mandate”); Calvin,\n405 F.Supp.2d at 943 (noting that strip searches “have repeatedly\n[been] invalidated . . . based on the reasoning that less invasive\nsearches or other detention practices could obviate the need for a\nstrip  search”  and  that  “a  prison  system  cannot  rely  on  the\nrealities  of  its  own  detention  structure  alone  to  justify  an\ninvasion of privacy as significant as a strip search”); Simenc v.\nSheriff of DuPage County, Ill., No. 82 C 4778, 1985 WL 4896, at *4\n(N.D. Ill. Dec. 9, 1985) (“At a minimum, jail officials should\nensure that [] embarrassment is minimized by conducting the search\nin an area where it cannot be observed by anyone other than the\nperson conducting the search.”).\n19\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 20 of 23\nI find the blanket strip search policy of male discharges\nviolates  the  Fourth  Amendment.    The  Bell  factors  weigh  in\nplaintiffs’ favor.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ motion for summary\njudgment is granted.   \nC.  Unreasonable Delay\nPlaintiffs argue they were subjected to unreasonable delays in\nbeing  released  from  the  CCDC  after  receiving  court-ordered\ndischarges.    Bullock  and  Reid  were  delayed  8.5  and  8  hours,\nrespectively.  Defendants argue the complexity of the discharge\nprocess justifies such a delay.  \nThe Supreme Court has set forth a 48 hour time limit for\nprobable cause determination after arrest.  County of Riverside v.\nMcLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991).  “This is not to say that the\nprobable  cause  determination  in  a  particular  case  passes\nconstitutional  muster  simply  because  it  is  provided  within  48\nhours.”  Id.  In Chortek v. City of Milwaukee, 356 F.3d 740, 747\n(7th Cir. 2004) the Seventh Circuit required the government to\njustify a four hour detention - half the time that is at issue\nhere.  The issue, then, becomes whether the delay was reasonable.\nCounty of Riverside, 500 U.S. at 56.                 \n“[T]he reasonableness of a length of detention typically ‘is\na question best left open for juries to answer based on the facts\npresented in each case.’” Chortek, 356 F.3d at 747 (quoting Lewis\nv. O’Grady, 853 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1988) (holding that\n20\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 21 of 23\neleven-hour  detention  of  individual  waiting  to  be  discharged\npresented a jury question).  “Examples of unreasonable delay are\ndelays for the purpose of gathering additional evidence to justify\nthe arrest, a delay motivated by ill will against the arrested\nindividual, or delay for delay’s sake.  In evaluating whether the\ndelay in a particular case is unreasonable, however, courts must\nallow a substantial degree of flexibility.”  County of Riverside,\n500 U.S. at 56.  \nDefendants seek summary judgment on the ground that they have\nprovided a sufficient explanation for the delay and there is no\nevidence demonstrating an improper purpose for the delay as set\nforth in Chortek, 356 F.3d 747-48.  However, both parties have\npresented conflicting evidence concerning the reasonableness of the\ndelay - mostly in the form of expert testimony.  Plaintiffs have\nprovided evidence that the jail computer system is quick, was not\nmalfunctioning, and that the jail staff is able to complete the\ndischarge  process  for  females  in  a  fraction  of  the  time.\nAccordingly, I find plaintiffs have established there is a triable\nissue concerning the reasonableness of the delay and defendants are\nnot entitled to summary judgment.  \nD.  Qualified Immunity\nCounty and local government entities are not covered by the\nEleventh Amendment.  Richmand v. Sheahan, 270 F.3d 430, 439 (7th\nCir. 2001) (citation omitted).  Defendants argue they are entitled\n21\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 22 of 23\nto  summary  judgment  on  plaintiffs’  damage  claim  because  the\nSheriff,  although  acting  in  his  official  capacity,  “could  be\nconsidered an agent of Illinois government insofar as requiring the\nstrip searching of all male and female inmates who return to their\nhousing division.”  (Def. Br. At 33-34.)4  If the Sheriff were\nacting as an arm of the state, then the claims for damages may not\nbe brought in federal court.  Id. \nDefendants cite to the Illinois Administrative Code (“IAC”) in\nsupport of the proposition that all male and female inmates must be\nstrip  searched.    The  IAC  does  not  support  this.    Instead,  it\nprovides\nDetainees permitted to leave the confines of the jail\ntemporarily, for any reason, shall be thoroughly searched\nprior to leaving and before re-entering the jail.\n20 Ill. ADC 701.140(a).  The provision does not mandate strip\nsearches, just that the inmates be “thoroughly searched.”  See\nWeber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 803 (2d Cir. 1986) (rejecting same\nargument under the New York Administrative Code).5  Defendants have\nnot established the Sheriff was acting as an arm of the state and,\n4It must be noted that this suit concerns the Equal Protection\nand Fourth Amendment rights of male discharges (not all inmates).\n5Defendants  argue  that  Illinois  state  appellate  court\ndecisions have interpreted “thoroughly searched” under the Illinois\nAdministrative  Code  to  mean  strip  searched.    Although  strip\nsearches were upheld in the cases referred to by defendants, none\nheld that a sheriff was required by state law to conduct a strip\nsearch.\n22\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01051     Document 360      Filed 07/30/2008     Page 23 of 23\ntherefore, are not entitled to qualified immunity.  Their motion\nfor summary judgment on this ground is denied. \nIV.\nFor  the  foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motion  for summary\njudgment  is  granted  with  respect  to  all  claims  except  the\nunreasonable delay claim.  Defendants’ motion for summary judgment\nis denied.  Defendants also filed a motion to strike, which is\ndenied  as  moot  for  I  did  not  rely  on  the  affidavits  of  Sean\nDriscoll or Jeffrey Dorsey.\n ENTER ORDER:\n ______________________________\n    Elaine E.
