Plaintiffs alleged that the State violated their Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches by conducting repeated strip searches without a reasonable basis. The detainees sought injunctive relief and damages.</p><p>On October 5, 2001, the Court (Peter C. Dorsey) consolidated the case with another case against the state, though the only available document for that case is the docket. The case went to trial beginning on April 3, 2002, and settlement conferences were held. On September 27, 2002, the Court denied plaintiffs' motion for preliminary class certification. 382 F.3d 225 (2004). A few days later, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss, holding that there was a reasonable basis for each of the strip searches conducted on plaintiffs, but requiring a new strip search policy in the detention centers.</p><p>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the District Court's decision and remanded the case, holding that strip searches are lawful upon admission to a detention facility, but repeated searches while children were in custody must be supported by reasonable suspicion; the Court also upheld the denial of class certification. Following the decision, the case was sent back to the District Court for further proceedings and fact finding. 382 F.3d 225 (2004). On February 14, 2005, after the parties settled, the District Court denied plaintiffs' new motion for certified class as moot, and the Court dismissed the case the following day. The only relief indicated was found in the United States Court of Appeals opinion, stating that a new strip search policy was implemented.</p><p></p>",

Kelly, Newport, RI, for Plaintiffs-Appellants.\nTerrence M. O'Neill, Asst. Atty. General, Hartford, CT (Richard Blumenthal, Atty. General, Steven R. Strom, Asst.\nAtty. General, Hartford, CT, on the brief) for Defendants-Appellees.\nBefore: NEWMAN, SOTOMAYOR, and WESLEY, Circuit Judges.\nJudge SOTOMAYOR concurs in part and dissents in part with a separate opinion.\nJON O. NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.\nThis appeal concerns the lawfulness of strip searches performed upon young girls in juvenile detention centers.\nThe parents of two female children appeal from the September 30, 2002, judgment of the District Court for the\nDistrict of Connecticut (Peter C. Dorsey, District Judge), ruling that, even though Connecticut's blanket strip\nsearch policy for all those admitted to juvenile detention centers (\"JDCs\") violates the Fourth Amendment, the\nparticular strip searches of their daughters, identified as S.C. and T.W., were lawful. The Appellants contend that\nthe searches were unlawful for lack of a reasonable basis to believe either that the juveniles had done anything\nthat would be a crime if committed by an adult or had possessed weapons or other contraband. The Appellants\nalso seek review of the District Court's denial of their motion for class certification.\nWe conclude that the searches conducted upon each initial entry into the custody of the State's juvenile\nauthorities were lawful, but that repetitive searches, conducted while the girls remained in custody, violated the\nFourth Amendment in the absence of reasonable suspicion that contraband was possessed. We therefore vacate\n227 *227 the judgment and remand to determine what relief, if any, should be awarded.\nBackground\nConnecticut's judicial branch, through its Court Support Services Division (\"CSSD\"), operates three juvenile\ndetention centers located in Bridgeport, Hartford, and New Haven. Connecticut also confines juveniles in other\ninstitutions with which it has contracts 00 the Girls Detention Center (\"GDC\"), operated by defendant CSI\n97\nConnecticut, Inc., and Juvenile Forensic Services (\"JFS\"), a center operated by defendant Juvenile Forensic\nServices, LLP. All of these facilities, collectively referred to as \"JDCs,\" admit thousands of juveniles annually. In\nConnecticut, a juvenile is either a \"child,\" defined as \"any person under sixteen years of age,\" Conn. Gen.Stat. §\n[1]\n46b-120(1) (2003), or a \"youth,\" defined as \"any person sixteen or seventeen years of age,\" id. § 46b-120(2).\nJDCs house juveniles detained for a wide variety of reasons, but the record is not entirely clear as to precisely\nwhat circumstances may result in confinement in JDCs. From the testimony of Judge Christine E. Keller, Chief\nAdministrative Judge for Juvenile Matters, it appears that the principal basis for detention is to await trial following\narrest for a serious juvenile offense. Upon arrest for a juvenile offense that is not serious, detention could also\noccur if the parents refuse to take the child back into their home and the State's Department of Children and\nFamilies cannot promptly find a bed in a suitable facility.\n\nAnother frequent basis for detention arises from a designation known as \"families with service needs.\" Conn.\nGen.Stat. § 46b-120(8). \"Families with service needs\" means a family that includes a child who has acted in one\nof five ways: (1) run away from home without just cause, (2) become beyond the control of parents, (3) engaged\nin indecent or immoral conduct, (4) been a truant or overtly defied school rules, or (5) if thirteen years of age or\n[2]\nolder, has engaged in sexual intercourse with a person of similar age. Id. Judge Keller explained that detention\ncan result upon a judge's finding that one of these five circumstances exists and that there is probable cause to\nbelieve that a delinquent act has been committed. Of these five categories, the most common are runaways and\ntruants.\nThe State policy. Operational Policy 311 of Connecticut's Judicial Branch Division of Juvenile Detention Services\n(\"the Policy\") provides for various searches, including frisk searches, general facility searches, area searches,\nperimeter searches, vehicle searches, and, pertinent to this appeal, strip searches. The Policy specifies that a\nstrip search shall be conducted upon each detainee's \"initial intake\" at a JDC and upon each detainee's\n\"readmission,\" or after any detainee \"has left the supervision of Detention Center or Judicial Branch staff (e.g., a\nfurlough or inpatient hospital admission), or an [Alternate Detention Program] resident returning to the Detention\nCenter to attend a court hearing.\" The Policy also authorizes strip searches upon \"reasonable belief that a\n228 detainee may be carrying dangerous contraband.\"[3] The Policy applies at the three *228 state-run JDCs and the\nJDCs operated under state contract.\nDescription of strip search.\nThe Policy, as amended September 1, 2002, prescribes the following steps for a staff member conducting a strip\n[4]\nsearch  to follow:\na. Inform the detainee of the strip search and the purpose of the search.\nb. Check the detainee's ears, nose and mouth, including under the tongue.\nc. Have the detainee remove and step away from clothing and shoes and put on a JDC-issued\nrobe.\nd. Have the detainee run his/her own hands through his/her hair.\ne. Check the bottom of detainee's feet.\nf. Have the detainee raise one arm of the robe to mid-biceps and examine top and bottom of arm\nand hand with fingers spread. Repeat the procedure with second arm and hand.\ng. Have the detainee raise the bottom of the robe to below the crotch to expose and inspect the\nfront of the legs and feet.\nh. Have the detainee turn 180 degrees and drop the robe off the shoulders in order to inspect the\nupper back and shoulders.\ni. Have the detainee raise the bottom of the robe to above the waist in order to inspect the\nbuttocks and legs.\nj. Have the detainee turn 180 degrees (facing staff), and drop the robe off the shoulders and open\nthe front of the robe, exposing the entire front of the body, shoulders, and upper arms.\nk. Instruct the detainee to shower and dress immediately in a clean uniform.\nl. Search all clothing and personal items, and label and store them appropriately.\n\nPrior to the September 1, 2002, revision, the Policy permitted a strip search to include a visual inspection of\nvaginal and anal body cavities, but the revision now specifies that \"[u]nder no circumstances will visual, manual,\nor instrument inspection of the vaginal or anal body cavities be conducted.\"\nStrip searches of S.C. S.C. has a history of mental illness, suicide attempts, self-mutilation, sexual activity with\nolder men, drug and alcohol abuse, and drug-peddling. In July 2000, S.C., then 14 years old, was adjudicated a\nmember of a \"family with service needs\" by the Superior Court as a result of her repeated failures to obey court\norders requiring her to stay at home or at institutions in which she was placed.\nS.C. testified, without contradiction, to having been strip searched eight times. The first occurred in July 2000\nafter Wallingford police arrested her for running away from home in violation of a court order and brought her to\n229 the New Haven *229 Juvenile Detention Center (\"NHJDC\"). The strip search was conducted by a female staff\nmember upon S.C.'s admission to NHJDC. S.C. was then presented before a Superior Court Judge, who ordered\nher detained at the Girls Detention Center (\"GDC\") pending future placement. After her return from state court,\nshe was transported from NHJDC to GDC in handcuffs and leg shackles. The second strip search occurred upon\nher admission to GDC. The third strip search occurred upon her return to GDC after being transported, in\nhandcuffs and shackles, to court. S.C. was later released to her parents under a court order not to run away from\nhome.\nFour more strip searches occurred in the fall of 2000. After S.C. had violated the above-mentioned court order,\nher parents called the police, who took her into custody and brought her to NHJDC. Upon her admission, a staff\nmember performed a strip search. This was her fourth strip search. She was then presented in court, and ordered\ndetained at JFS to which she was transported in handcuffs and shackles. The fifth strip search occurred upon her\nadmission to JFS. The sixth and seventh strip searches were performed during S.C.'s detention at JFS when\ninstitutional searches were conducted due to concern over a missing pencil. S.C. was later released to her\nparents.\nThe eighth strip search occurred in January 2001. After S.C. ran away from home again, the state court ordered\nher placed in Stonington Institute, a hospital, to await placement. S.C. ran away, but eventually turned herself in\nto the Wallingford Police Department. When the police delivered her to NHJDC, a staff member strip searched\nS.C. upon admission.\nDuring the second and third searches, S.C. was instructed to squat and cough, as she explained, \"to check if\nthere is anything that might fall out of your cavities.\" The record is unclear as to whether visual inspection of\nvaginal or anal body cavities occurred during these two searches, but this ambiguity need not be resolved\nbecause the Policy currently in effect prohibits such inspections, and, as discussed below, we conclude that\nthese two searches were unlawful for other reasons. No contraband was found in any of the eight strip searches.\nStrip searches of T.W. T.W. was strip searched twice. In October 2000, T.W., then a 13-year-old girl with a history\nof persistent truancy, and possibly mental health issues, had been adjudicated a member of a \"family with service\nneeds\" due to her truancy. When she violated court orders requiring her to attend the seventh grade, the Superior\nCourt ordered her detained at NHJDC, where a staff member strip searched her upon admission. The next day,\nshe was transferred to GDC in handcuffs and leg shackles. Upon admission, a GDC staff member performed\nT.W.'s second strip search. After one week, T.W. was released to her mother.\nVisual inspection of vaginal or anal body cavities was not performed during either of the two strip searches. No\ncontraband was found in either search.\nThe lawsuit. S.C.'s and T.W.'s parents brought a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for damages and injunctive relief\nagainst the State of Connecticut as well as various directors and supervisors of CSSD, Juvenile Detention\nServices, NHJDC, Department of Children and Families of the State of Connecticut; CSI Connecticut, Inc., and\nJuvenile Forensic Services, LLP, individually and in their official capacities. The suit challenged the JDCs' policy\nof strip searching all admittees, regardless of the cause for admission, as violative of S.C.'s and T.W.'s Fourth\n230 Amendment protection *230 from unreasonable searches.[5] They sought to bring a damages suit on behalf of a\nclass of juveniles held as members of \"families with service needs,\" arrested for noncriminal offenses, or charged\n\nwith minor offenses in Connecticut, all of whom were strip searched in the named juvenile detention facilities\npursuant to the Defendants' policy.\nDistrict Court ruling. After denying class certification, Judge Dorsey stated that the strip search policy, applicable\n[6]\nto all confined children in JDCs, violated the Fourth Amendment,  but nevertheless ruled that the strip searches\nof S.C. and T.W. were reasonable. He concluded that the history of both girls \"suggest[ed] prospective behavior\nwhich would predispose them to bringing various contraband into a JDC.\" He found S.C. to be \"rebellious, defiant\nof authority, suicidal, belligerent, promiscuous, a drug user and dealer and mentally unstable.\" Acknowledging\nthat T.W.'s truancy was \"a quieter rejection of authority,\" he nonetheless found that her bouts of depression and\nexpression of regret at having been born created a risk of self-injury that rendered the strip searches reasonable.\nThe complaint was ordered dismissed.\nDiscussion\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits \"unreasonable\" searches, a somewhat amorphous standard whose meaning\nvaries with the context in which a search occurs and the circumstances of the search. In the enforcement of\ncriminal law, a search generally requires the prior issuance of a warrant, supported by probable cause to believe\nthat identified items will be found. See Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 619, 109 S.Ct.\n1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989). In some circumstances a warrant is not required, but \"some quantum of\nindividualized suspicion\" must be shown. Id. at 624, 109 S.Ct. 1402 (internal quotation marks omitted). Less\nintrusive \"frisks\" are permitted upon articulable suspicion concerning the person to be stopped and frisked. See \nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20-21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).\nOutside the law enforcement context, \"in the context of safety and administrative regulations, a search\nunsupported by probable cause may be reasonable when special needs, beyond the normal need for law\nenforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable.\" Board of Education v. Earls, 536\n[7]\nU.S. 822, 829, 122 S.Ct. 2559, 153 L.Ed.2d 735 (2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \"[I]n\ncertain limited circumstances, the Government's need to discover . . . latent or hidden conditions, or to prevent\ntheir development, is sufficiently compelling to justify the intrusion on privacy entailed by conducting such\n231 searches without any measure of individualized suspicion.\" Id. (internal quotation *231 marks and citation\nomitted). However, the \"special needs\" standard does not validate searches simply because a special need\nexists. Instead, what is required is \"a fact-specific balancing of the intrusion... against the promotion of legitimate\ngovernmental interests.\" Id. at 830, 122 S.Ct. 2559. This is simply an application of the overarching principle that\n\"[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment ... requires a balancing of the need for the particular\nsearch against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct.\n1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nThese principles have been applied to permit reasonable searches, without warrants, in hospitals, see O'Connor\nv. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709, 725, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 94 L.Ed.2d 714 (1987); schools, see New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469\nU.S. 325, 341-43, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985); government agencies, see National Treasury\nEmployees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 666-67, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (1989); and highly\nregulated industries, see Skinner, 489 U.S. at 633, 109 S.Ct. 1402. Pertinent to the pending case are decisions\napplying the \"special needs\" test to uphold suspicionless drug-testing (urinalysis) of middle and high school\nstudents participating in extracurricular activities, Earls, 536 U.S. at 828-38, 122 S.Ct. 2559, and students\nparticipating in school athletics, see Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 664-65, 115 S.Ct. 2386,\n132 L.Ed.2d 564 (1995).\nEspecially pertinent to the pending case, the \"special needs\" standard applies to searches in penal institutions, \nsee Roe v. Marcotte, 193 F.3d 72, 78 (2d Cir.1999), although the Supreme Court's first use of the standard in this\ncontext occurred before the phrase \"special needs\" had been coined, see Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559-60, 99 S.Ct.\n1861. In Wolfish, the Supreme Court acknowledged that when a person has been convicted and lawfully\nconfined, constitutional protections do not cease, see Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 545, 99 S.Ct. 1861, but \"`[l]awful\nincarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights,'\" id. at 545-46, 99\nS.Ct. 1861 (quoting Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948)). Subsequently,\n\nthe Court formulated a variation of the \"special needs\" standard applicable to adjudication of constitutional claims\nof those lawfully confined: \"[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is\nvalid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct.\n2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987); see Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132-33, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 156 L.Ed.2d 162\n(2003); O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 349, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987).\nStrip searches performed on those lawfully confined have provoked considerable litigation. In Wolfish, the\nSupreme Court upheld a strip search, including visual inspection of body cavities, of sentenced prisoners and\n232 pretrial detainees, after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution.[8]441 U.S. at 558-60, *232\n99 S.Ct. 1861. This Court has upheld routine random strip searches, including body-cavity inspections,\nperformed on prison inmates. See Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73, 76-80 (2d Cir.1992); see also Hurley v. Ward,\n584 F.2d 609, 612 (2d Cir.1978) (reversing portion of injunction prohibiting strip searches of prison inmates).\nHowever, in several decisions, we have ruled that strip searches may not be performed upon adults confined\nafter arrest for misdemeanors, in the absence of reasonable suspicion concerning possession of contraband. See\nShain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 62-66 (2d Cir.2001); Wachtler v. County of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.1994); \nWalsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 68-69 (2d Cir.1988); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986). But see \nShain, 273 F.3d at 70-76 (Cabranes, J., dissenting) (contending that Weber had been superseded by the\nSupreme Court's decision in Turner and that this consequence should have led to upholding the strip search\npolicies in Shain, Wachtler, and Walsh). As far as we can tell, all the circuits to have considered the issue have\nreached the same conclusion with respect to strip searches of adults confined for minor offenses. See Miller v.\nKennebec County, 219 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.2000) (failure to pay fine); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1012-13\n(4th Cir.1981) (drunk driving); Kelly v. Foti, 77 F.3d 819, 821-22 (5th Cir.1996) (motor vehicle violations); Masters\nv. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253-55 (6th Cir.1989) (failure to appear for motor vehicle violation); Mary Beth G. v.\nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1266, 1268-73 (7th Cir.1983) (various misdemeanors); Jones v. Edwards, 770\nF.2d 739, 740-42 (8th Cir.1985) (refusal to sign complaint for leash law violation); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d\n614, 615-19 (9th Cir.1984) (motor vehicle violations); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395-97 (10th Cir.1993)\n(same).\nStrip searches of children pose the reasonableness inquiry in a context where both the interests supporting and\nopposing such searches appear to be greater than with searches of adults confined for minor offenses. Where\nthe state is exercising some legitimate custodial authority over children, its responsibility to act in the place of\nparents (in loco parentis) obliges it to take special care to protect those in its charge, and that protection must be\nconcerned with dangers from others and self-inflicted harm. \"Children ... are assumed to be subject to the control\nof their parents, and if parental control falters, the State must play its part as parens patriae.... In this respect, the\njuvenile's liberty interest may, in appropriate circumstances, be subordinated to the State's `parens patriae\n[9]\ninterest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child.'\" Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 265, 104 S.Ct.\n2403, 81 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984) (quoting Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 766, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599\n(1982)) (upholding pretrial detention). At the same time, the adverse psychological effect of a strip search is likely\n[10]\nto be more severe upon a child than an adult, especially a child who has been the victim of sexual abuse.\n233 *233 In the pending case, neither side has called to our attention an appellate ruling on the reasonableness of\nstrip searches of juveniles in lawful state custody, in the absence of individualized suspicion of possession of\ncontraband. The Seventh Circuit has ruled unreasonable school officials' strip search of a 13-year-old female\nstudent to find narcotics, in the absence of reasonable cause to believe she possessed any narcotics. See Doe v.\nRenfrow, 631 F.2d 91, 92-93 (7th Cir.1980). Unlike S.C. and T.W., the student searched in Doe was not confined\nin a detention facility. The Eleventh Circuit has upheld strip searches of incarcerated juveniles, but only upon a\nshowing of reasonable suspicion of possession of contraband. See Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d\n188, 193 (11th Cir.1992). A district court has ruled unconstitutional strip searches of detained juvenile aliens\nconducted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. See Flores v. Meese, 681 F.Supp. 665 (C.D.Cal.1988).\nAgainst this background of pertinent but not precisely governing case law, we consider the claims in the pending\ncase. Connecticut acknowledges that its strip search policy \"is not related to the investigation of criminal acts,\" Br.\nfor Appellees at 19, and contends that the individualized suspicion requirement associated with criminal law\nenforcement is therefore not applicable. Instead, the State contends that the Policy comports with the \"special\n\nneeds\" test of Earls and, alternatively, is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests so as to satisfy the\ntest of Turner.\nIn determining whether the strip searches of S.C. and T.W. violated the Fourth Amendment under the standards\nof either Earls or Turner, we first consider the nature of the intrusion upon the girls' privacy. A strip search with\nbody-cavity inspection is the practice that \"instinctively\" has given the Supreme Court \"the most pause.\" Wolfish,\n441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The Seventh Circuit has described strip searches as \"demeaning,\"\n\"dehumanizing,\" and \"terrifying.\" Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Tenth\nCircuit has called them \"terrifying.\" Chapman, 989 F.2d at 396. The Eighth Circuit has called them \"humiliating.\" \nHunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 674 (8th Cir.1982). And since \"youth ... is a ... condition of life when a person may\nbe most susceptible... to psychological damage,\" Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 115, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71\nL.Ed.2d 1 (1982), \"[c]hildren are especially susceptible to possible traumas from strip searches,\" Flores, 681\nF.Supp. at 667.\nIn assessing the interests served by the strip searches, we think the searches must be considered separately\nsince the justifications are not the same for each search. The second, third, and fifth searches of S.C. and the\nsecond search of T.W. were conducted after the children's transfer from one facility to another. Upon their initial\nadmission to a detention facility, they had been strip searched, and they remained in custody throughout the\ntransfer process. For example, after being searched upon admission to NHJDC, S.C. was transferred to court,\ntransferred back to NHJDC, and then transferred to GDC. There is no indication that she had any unsupervised\nopportunity to acquire contraband during these transfers. Whatever the justification for strip searches upon initial\n234 admission to a first detention facility, we see no state interest sufficient to warrant repeated strip searches simply \n[11]\n*234 because of transfers to other facilities. See Hodges v. Stanley, 712 F.2d 34, 35 (2d Cir.1983) (second\nsearch of administrative detainee appears to be unnecessary and unreasonable when detainee had been under\ncontinuous escort after initial search). Arguably, it was more convenient for the personnel at GDC to strip search\nS.C. upon her admission there, rather than determine whether she had been strip searched upon her prior\nadmission to NHJDC and had remained in custody throughout the transfer process. Mere convenience, however,\ncannot be a sufficient interest to justify such a serious impairment of privacy. We recognize that unavoidable\ncircumstances might arise, even during a period of continuous custody, that create opportunities for an inmate to\nacquire contraband, in which event a strip search might well be reasonable. No such circumstances were shown\nin this case.\nOf course, a prior strip search and continuous custody thereafter cannot guarantee protection from subsequent\n[12]\naccess to contraband,  but the State's opportunity to maintain surveillance during custody after an initial strip\nsearch, in addition to the availability of other search techniques, renders unreasonable a subsequent strip search\nin the absence of reasonable suspicion of possession of contraband.\nThe sixth and seventh strip searches of S.C. occurred at JFS, prompted by the disappearance of a pencil on two\nseparate occasions. Pencils had been handed out to a group of ten to twenty girls in a room, and one had not\nbeen returned. Since S.C. had already been strip searched upon her initial admission to JFS, a repeated search\nto see if S.C. had taken the missing pencil on either occasion required at least some reasonable suspicion\npointing to her as the culprit. We have ruled that strip searches of those arrested for misdemeanors require\nreasonable suspicion of possession of contraband. See Shain, 273 F.3d at 62-66. Although we recognize the\npossibilities that a pencil could be used as a weapon and could be concealed in a body-cavity, the combination of\nthese possibilities alone is too unlikely to justify the serious intrusion of a strip search, in the absence of\nreasonable suspicion concerning possession of the missing item. Such reasonable suspicion might arise if less\nintrusive searches such as pat-downs of the girls in the room where the pencil disappeared failed to locate it,\n[13]\nraising suspicion that one of the girls in that room had the pencil concealed.\n235 With respect to the searches performed upon the girls' initial admission to *235 state custody, the issue is closer.\nTo justify the searches under the Turner standard would extend that standard beyond the context in which it was\nestablished 00 a prison. 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254. S.C. and T.W. were confined in juvenile detention\n97\nfacilities. They had not been convicted of any crime, and were not confined awaiting trial on any criminal charges.\nOn the other hand, contraband such as a knife or drugs can pose a hazard to the security of an institution and the\nsafety of inmates whether the institution houses adults convicted of crimes or juveniles in detention centers. Yet\n\nbefore we can uphold a search as reasonably related to penological interests, there must be some justification for\nplacing the person searched into the type of institution where the Turner standard applies. Perhaps the Turner\nstandard applies to a state facility confining juveniles who have been convicted of conduct that would be a crime\nif committed by an adult, and, perhaps it even applies to juveniles awaiting trial for such conduct. This would be\nso if \"penological interests\" include the interests of a state in confining juveniles convicted of, or awaiting trial for,\nsuch conduct. If that is so, there would be a substantial argument that a strip search of juveniles upon their initial\nadmission to such a facility would satisfy the Turner standard of being reasonably related to valid penological\ninterests.\nBut it is far from clear that the Turner standard applies to juveniles confined for running away from home or failing\nto attend school, even where such conduct occurs in violation of a court order. Whatever a state's interests in\nconfining such juveniles in order to discharge its substitute parent responsibilities, we doubt that such\nconfinement serves the sort of penological interests the Supreme Court had in mind in fashioning a standard\napplicable to adult prisons. No doubt a state has a legitimate interest in confining such juveniles in some\ncircumstances, but it does not follow that by placing them in an institution where the state might be entitled, under\nTurner, to conduct strip searches of those convicted of adult-type crimes, a state may invoke Turner to justify strip\nsearches of runaways and truants.\nMoreover, there is some basis for doubting that the Turner standard applies to a claim of constitutional protection \nfrom state action such as a strip search. Turner concerned prisoners' assertion of affirmative rights to correspond\nwith other prisoners and to marry. 482 U.S. at 81-82, 107 S.Ct. 2254. The cases on which it relied, see id. at\n84-87, 107 S.Ct. 2254, concerned prisoners' assertion of affirmative rights to mail uncensored letters, Procunier\nv. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 407-12, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); to media interviews, Pell v. Procunier,\n417 U.S. 817, 821-27, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974); to organize a union, Jones v. North Carolina\nPrisoners' Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 125-27, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977); and to order books, Wolfish,\n[14]\n441 U.S. at 548-52, 99 S.Ct. 1861.  Significantly, one of the factors the Supreme Court identified as pertinent\nto the reasonableness of a challenged prison regulation was the availability of \"ready alternatives\" for the\nprisoners to exercise their rights. Turner, 482 U.S. at 90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. \"[I]f an inmate claimant can point to an\n236 alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests, a court \n*236 may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.\" Id.\nat 91, 107 S.Ct. 2254. The consideration of alternative ways for the prisoner to exercise affirmative rights was an\nunderstandable part of the overall \"reasonableness\" inquiry in Turner and the cases it relied on, but has doubtful\nrelevance to a prisoner's claim to be free from a constitutionally unreasonable search.\nS.C. was initially confined for violating a court order not to run away from home, and T.W. was initially confined for\nviolating a court order to attend school. The justification for impairing their constitutional rights for such conduct\nunder the Turner rationale would seem to be less substantial even than that held insufficient for adults confined\nafter arraignment on misdemeanor charges, see Shain, 273 F.3d at 62-66. Although such adults have not been\nconvicted, there was at least probable cause to believe that they had committed crimes. For all of these reasons,\nwe doubt that the strip searches of S.C. and T.W. can be upheld under the Turner rationale.\nFor several reasons, the State makes a more substantial contention in relying on the \"special needs\" standard of \nEarls. First, although the age of the children renders them especially vulnerable to the distressing effects of a\nstrip search, it also provides the State with an enhanced responsibility to take reasonable action to protect them\nfrom hazards resulting from the presence of contraband where the children are confined. The State has\ntemporarily become the de facto guardian of children lawfully removed from their home, and \"when the\ngovernment acts as guardian ... the relevant question is whether the search is one that a reasonable guardian ...\nmight undertake,\" Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 665, 115 S.Ct. 2386. The State has a more pervasive responsibility for\nchildren in detention centers twenty-four hours a day than for the children in Vernonia and Earls who were under\nState authority for the few hours of the school day. Second, a strip search serves the protective function of\n[15]\nlocating and removing concealed items that could be used for self-mutilation or even suicide.  Approximately\none half of the girls admitted to JDCs showed signs of self-mutilation. A child psychologist testified that children\noften self-mutilate in part because of their inability to articulate their feelings. Third, a strip search will often\n\ndisclose evidence of abuse that occurred in the home, and awareness of such abuse can assist juvenile\nauthorities in structuring an appropriate plan of care.\nThe discovery-of-abuse factor raises two issues that require further consideration. The first is whether the factor\nmay be considered at all in view of the testimony of an assistant supervisor at NHJDC that finding evidence of\n[16]\nabuse is not one of the purposes of performing strip searches.  In considering the subjective purpose for\n237 which a search is undertaken, the Supreme *237 Court has distinguished between a search of a particular\nindividual and searches undertaken pursuant to a \"general scheme without individualized suspicion.\" Indianapolis\nv. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 46, 121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d 333 (2000). A law enforcement officer's subjective\npurpose is irrelevant to the lawfulness of the search of a particular individual, id. at 45, 121 S.Ct. 447; Whren v.\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), but is relevant to the validity of a\ngeneral search policy, such as one implemented incident to a roadblock, Edmond, 531 U.S. at 45-46, 121 S.Ct.\n447. As to the latter, a primary purpose \"to advance the general interest in crime control,\" id. at 44 n. 1, 121 S.Ct.\n447 (internal quotation marks omitted), will not suffice, id. at 44-48, 121 S.Ct. 447. Thus, searches incident to a\nroad block set up for the primary purpose of apprehending drug law violators were held unreasonable, see id. at\n48, 121 S.Ct. 447, while a primary public safety purpose of removing drunk drivers from the highways justified\nroad blocks for sobriety checks, see Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 450-55, 110 S.Ct.\n2481, 110 L.Ed.2d 412 (1990).\nIn the pending case, the evidence establishes the State's primary non-law enforcement purposes 00 to protect the\n97\nchildren from harm inflicted by themselves or other inmates, and to protect the safety of the institution. With these\nvalid purposes established, we think the additional purpose of detecting abuse may be weighed in the\nreasonableness assessment, even if it was not subjectively entertained by state officials. Whether or not this\njustification alone would support a strip search, it permissibly adds to the combination of \"special needs\" that\nconfront the State at a child's initial admission to a detention facility. Discovery of abuse is not precluded from\ncontributing to the reasonableness of searches undertaken primarily to protect the safety of the person searched\nand the institution.\nThe detecting-abuse factor also encounters the ruling we have made that protects parents' rights to control the\ncare and custody of their children by assuring that intrusive examinations of their children for evidence of abuse\nwill not be undertaken without parental consent or judicial authorization. See Tenenbaum v. Williams, 193 F.3d\n581, 597-99 (2d Cir.1999); van Emrik v. Chemung County Department of Social Services, 911 F.2d 863, 867 (2d\nCir.1990). However, those rulings concerned intrusions that \"serve primarily an investigative function.\" Id. at 867.\n\"The purpose was not to provide medical treatment to the child, but to provide investigative assistance to the\ncaseworker.\" Id. Moreover, the intrusions at issue were x-rays, id. at 865, and medical examinations, Tenenbaum,\n193 F.3d at 587. These rulings do not necessarily bar visual examinations for evidence of abuse undertaken by\ncustodians responsible for developing and implementing an appropriate plan of care and treatment.\nThe facts of this case do not yield an obvious answer to the question whether it was constitutionally \"reasonable\"\nto perform strip searches upon S.C. and T.W. upon their initial admission to detention facilities. Assessing all of\nthe circumstances 00 the risks to the psychological health of the children from performing the searches and the\n97\nrisks to their well-being and to institutional safety from not performing the searches, we conclude that the strip\nsearches upon initial admission do not violate Fourth Amendment standards. However, since we do not reach the\nsame conclusion with respect to repetitive searches undertaken after the children had been searched and\n238 remained in custody, absent any reasonable basis to think that they had acquired and secreted contraband *238\nwhile in custody, we rule that the second, third, and fifth searches of S.C. and the second search of T.W. were\nunlawful. As to the sixth and seventh searches of S.C. (concerning a missing pencil), we will permit the parties on\nremand to amplify the record so that the District Court can make findings as to the existence of reasonable\nsuspicion.\nClass action ruling. The denial of class action certification was well within the District Court's discretion, for\nreasons set forth in Judge Dorsey's opinion.\n\nConclusion\nThe judgment dismissing the action is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings with respect to\nthe sixth and seventh searches of S.C. and for determination of what relief, if any, is warranted as a result of our\nruling that the second, third, and fifth searches of S.C. and the second search of T.W. were unlawful.\nSOTOMAYOR, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI concur with the majority's holding that the second, third, and fifth searches of S.C. and the second search of\nT.W. were unlawful. Absent an individualized basis to believe that the plaintiffs had acquired contraband while in\ncustody of the authorities, these re-entry searches violated Fourth Amendment standards of reasonableness.\nWith respect to the sixth and seventh searches of S.C., I concur with the majority's decision to remand to the\ndistrict court to make factual findings as to the existence of reasonable suspicion. I also agree that the denial of\nclass certification was well within the district court's discretion.\nI dissent, however, from the Court's decision to uphold the first, fourth, and eighth strip searches of S.C. and the\nfirst strip search of T.W. Our caselaw consistently has recognized the severely intrusive nature of strip searches\nand has placed strict limits on their use. The concerns animating our prior rulings in this area should be only\nheightened when the privacy interests of emotionally troubled children are at stake. Here, the government has\nfailed to demonstrate that its special needs should overcome these concerns and allow for strip searches, in the\nabsence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime. Accordingly, I\nwould find that, regardless of whether the suspicionless strip searches occurred upon entry or re-entry, they were\nunlawful.\nI agree with the majority that the proper framework for analysis of the strip searches at issue is the \"special\nneeds\" balancing test of Board of Education v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 829, 122 S.Ct. 2559, 153 L.Ed.2d 735\n(2002), rather than the Turner standard for penal institutions, Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254,\n96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). The source of my disagreement with the majority lies in the application of the balancing\ntest to the facts before us. In my view, the government has not demonstrated adequately that the highly invasive\nsuspicionless strip searches bore a \"close and substantial relationship to the government's special needs.\" \nUnited States v. Lifshitz, 369 F.3d 173, 186 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nA.\nAs the majority observes, strip searches 00 as compared to other kinds of searches 00 \"instinctively give[ ] us the\n97 97\nmost pause.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). We have called a strip\nsearch \"a highly intrusive invasion,\" Rivera v. United States, 928 F.2d 592, 607 (2d Cir.1991) (citation and internal\n239 quotation marks omitted), \"an extreme intrusion upon personal privacy,\" *239Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233,\n235 n. 6 (1st Cir.1990), and \"an offense to the dignity of the individual,\" id. We hardly have been alone in this\nassessment. The Eleventh Circuit has accepted as \"axiomatic that a strip search represents a serious intrusion\nupon personal rights.\" Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (11th Cir.1992). The Seventh Circuit\nhas referred to strip searches as \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant,\nembarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\" Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d\n1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Other courts have reached similar\nconclusions. See Roe v. Texas Dep't of Protective & Regulatory Serv., 299 F.3d 395, 404, 405 & n. 11 (5th\nCir.2002); Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 110 (1st Cir.2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395-96\n(10th Cir.1993); Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1446 (9th Cir.1989); Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d\n668, 674 (8th Cir.1982); Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F.2d 91, 92-93 (7th Cir.1980) (per curiam); Flores v. Meese, 681\nF.Supp. 665, 667 (C.D.Cal.1988),rev'd on other grounds, Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123\nL.Ed.2d 1 (1993).\nWe should be especially wary of strip searches of children, since youth \"is a time and condition of life when a\nperson may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.\" Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104,\n\n115, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982); see also Flores, 681 F.Supp. at 667 (\"Children are especially\nsusceptible to possible traumas from strip searches.\"). When officials are dealing with children who may be\nvictims of sexual abuse, the concerns are even greater. See ante, at 232 n. 10.\nThe case before us presents facts that provoke all of our typical concerns about strip searches. The detention\nfacility officers on numerous occasions ordered appellants 00 troubled adolescent girls facing no criminal charges\n97\n00 to remove all of their clothes and underwear. The officials inspected the girls' naked bodies front and back, and\n97\nhad them lift their breasts and spread out folds of fat. The young girls described the process as embarrassing and\nhumiliating. Indeed, T.W. cried throughout one of her searches. During one of S.C.'s searches, two other\n[1]\ndetainees were present. The juvenile detention facilities perform similar searches on every girl who enters,\nnotwithstanding the fact that many of them 00 indeed, most of them 00 have been victims of abuse or neglect, and\n97 97\n[2]\nmay be more vulnerable mentally and emotionally than other youths their age.\nGiven the uniquely invasive and upsetting nature of strip searches, it is not surprising that with the exception of\nthe prison setting, see Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73, 76-80 (2d Cir.1992), we have never found that a strip\nsearch in the absence of any individualized suspicion was reasonable. Even in the context of lawful detention and\n240 confinement, we have recognized *240 constitutional limits on the state's authority to conduct strip searches 00\n97\nlimits that the majority disregards in the present case. In Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 804 (2d Cir.1986), we held\nthat reasonable suspicion was required in order to strip search a defendant arrested and detained for\nmisdemeanors. We reached this holding even assuming the correctness of a sheriff's assertion that seventy\npercent of such arrestees possessed contraband. Id. at 802 (finding that even if such a statistic were proven, it\ndid not provide the particularized suspicion required by the Constitution to justify a strip search). Furthermore, in \nWeber, we did not state that a strip search of a felony arrestee, in the absence of individualized suspicion, would\nbe lawful; rather, we suggested that, among other things, the nature of the offense for which the felony arrestee is\ndetained furnishes the individualized suspicion required to justify the search. Id. We have applied and affirmed \nWeber's restrictions on strip searches in numerous cases. See Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 62-66 (2d Cir.2001);\nWachtler v. County of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 81-82 (2d Cir.1994); Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 68-69 (2d\nCir.1988). As the majority notes, all of the circuits considering the issue of strip searches of adults confined for\nminor offenses have reached the same conclusion. See ante, at 231-32.\nIn three other cases not discussed by the majority, we have likewise held that at least some individualized\nsuspicion is necessary in order to justify a strip search, even where the government demonstrated a special\nneed. See Sec. & Law Enforcement Employees, Dist. Council 82 v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187, 209-10 (2d Cir.1984); \nM.M. v. Anker, 607 F.2d 588, 589 (2d Cir.1979) (per curiam); United States v. Asbury, 586 F.2d 973, 975-77 (2d\nCir.1978).\nAnker involved a strip search of a student conducted by a teacher. Our decision foreshadowed the advent of the\nspecial needs doctrine by recognizing, in the context of searches performed at schools, that school\nadministrators are entitled to \"greater flexibility\" with regard to Fourth Amendment concerns because of the\n\"unique relationship [teachers have] to their students, both in administering discipline as part of their educational\nfunction, and in protecting the well-being of all children in their care and custody.\" Anker, 607 F.2d at 589.\nNevertheless, we held that \"when a teacher conducts a highly intrusive invasion such as the strip search in this\ncase, it is reasonable to require that probable cause be present.\" Id. Thus, even in a school setting where special\nneeds permit some searches in the absence of probable cause, our caselaw only allows strip searches when\nthere is probable cause.\nIn Carey, 737 F.2d at 192, the plaintiffs subjected to strip searches were corrections officers searched pursuant to\na policy authorizing random, suspicionless searches for the purpose of detecting and deterring contraband\nsmuggling. Although we acknowledged that the officers had a diminished expectation of privacy largely due to the\nnature of their work, id. at 202, and although we recognized the important governmental interest in \"maintaining\nprison security and preserving internal order and discipline,\" id., we nonetheless held that some individualized\nsuspicion of possession of contraband was necessary to justify a strip search of the officers. Id. at 203-04.\n\nSimilarly, in Asbury we held that strip searches conducted at national borders must be premised on some\nmeasure of individualized suspicion and that \"the suspicion should be substantial enough to make the search a\nreasonable exercise of authority.\" 586 F.2d at 975-76.\n241 *241 Although we recognized that the government's asserted special needs justified a relaxation of the probable\ncause standard in each of these cases, we nonetheless held that at least some individualized suspicion was\nneeded to conduct a strip search.\nThe only exception to this principle that we thus far have recognized is an exception for prison inmates, see \nCovino, 967 F.2d at 76-80, which the plaintiffs 00 who have never faced any criminal charges 00 indisputably are\n97 97\nnot. Thus, to hold that the strip searches of the two girls in the instant appeal were reasonable is equivalent to\nsaying that these girls are entitled to the same level of Fourth Amendment protection as prison inmates held on\nfelony charges, and to decidedly less protection than people crossing the border, jail inmates detained on\nmisdemeanor charges, prison corrections officers, or students in public school.\nThe majority opinion cites many cases upholding reasonable searches under the special needs doctrine, but\nnone of these cases is remotely comparable to the case at hand, because 00 with the exception of cases in the\n97\nprison context 00 none involved strip searches. See Earls, 536 U.S. at 838, 122 S.Ct. 2559 (upholding student\n97\ndrug tests); Vernonia Sch. Dist. v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 664-65, 115 S.Ct. 2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 (1995) (same); \nNat'l Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 679, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (1989)\n(upholding employee drug tests); Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 619, 634, 109 S.Ct. 1402,\n103 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989) (same); O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709, 728-29, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 94 L.Ed.2d 714\n(1987) (plurality opinion) (establishing a reasonableness standard, instead of a probable cause standard, for\nsearches of public employees' personal papers); New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 347-48, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83\nL.Ed.2d 720 (1985) (upholding a search of a high school student's purse). The majority suggests that one case, \nRoe v. Marcotte, 193 F.3d 72, 78 (2d Cir.1999), is \"[e]specially pertinent,\" ante at 231, but that case is not\npertinent at all, as it involved blood tests of convicted adult sex offenders held in prison. See Roe, 193 F.3d at 74.\nThe non-prison cases relied upon by the majority involve, at their most intrusive, suspicionless drug testing of\nstudents or employees. In all of these cases, however, the person subjected to the drug test had voluntarily\nundertaken the job or activity that required testing. See, e.g., Earls, 536 U.S. at 831-32, 122 S.Ct. 2559 (finding\nthat students voluntarily engaged in extracurricular activities). More importantly, the drug tests never required\nanything as \"highly intrusive,\" Rivera, 928 F.2d at 607, as inspection by state officials of the plaintiff's naked body.\nThe majority does not rely on any non-prison case upholding strip searches in the absence of particularized\nsuspicion, because, of course, no such case exists.\nWhile the majority overstates the relevance of the above-mentioned cases, it downplays the significance of the\nmost closely analogous case it cites, Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir.1992). In \nJustice, the police detained two juveniles for loitering and truancy. At the police station, officers subjected one of\nthem to a strip search. The Eleventh Circuit agreed with the defendants that \"a detention center, police station, or\njail holding cell is a place `fraught with serious security dangers.'\" Id. at 193 (quoting Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99\nS.Ct. 1861). However, because strip searches were such a \"serious intrusion upon personal rights,\" id. at 192,\nthe court found that searches also had to be justified by the presence of individualized suspicion. Id. at 189\n242 (\"[L]aw enforcement officers may subject a juvenile who is lawfully in *242 custody to a strip search based upon\nreasonable suspicion that the juvenile is concealing a weapon or contraband.\"). The court explained: \"We must\ndetermine whether the officers, based on the totality of the circumstances, had a particularized and objective\nbasis for suspecting the particular person[] [searched] of criminal activity.\" Id. at 193 (alterations in original)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 194 (considering six reasons reasonable\nindividualized suspicion existed in that case). Though the instant case occurred outside of the law enforcement\ncontext, I would nevertheless follow the Eleventh Circuit's rationale and hold that reasonable suspicion must be\npresent in order to strip search a juvenile who is not alleged to have committed a crime.\n\nB.\nI turn next to the government's concerns assertedly motivating the searches and the efficacy of the searches in\nmeeting those concerns. The majority argues that the government's special needs are even more compelling in\nthe context of juvenile detention facilities than they are in cases involving public schools or correctional facilities. I\nagree. However, it is not enough for the government simply to assert a compelling special need. Our special\nneeds jurisprudence generally has also required that the search \"seek a minimum of intrusiveness coupled with\nmaximal effectiveness so that the search[] bear[s] a close and substantial relationship to the government's\nspecial needs.\" United States v. Lifshitz, 369 F.3d 173, 186 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\nis not to say that the Fourth Amendment requires that only \"least intrusive means\" be used in order to effectuate\nthe government's interests, but a \"close and substantial relationship\" between the intrusiveness and the need\nmust be demonstrated nevertheless. Id. at 184, 186 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The\ngovernment bears the burden of demonstrating this nexus between the search and the asserted special need. \nSee Bell v. Manson, 590 F.2d 1224, 1226 (2d Cir.1978).\nThe government here has completely failed to demonstrate that the invasive strip searches bore a \"close and\nsubstantial\" relationship to any governmental need. This first becomes clear upon examining the thirty-four \"event\nreports\" for the years 1995 through 2000 produced during discovery. The reports describe the occasions on\nwhich officers discovered contraband in the possession of the detainees. Of the thirty-four reports of contraband\nviolations, thirty-two describe contraband that either (1) was discovered through a search that was less intrusive\nthan a full strip search; (2) could have been discovered through a search that was less intrusive than a full strip\nsearch; or (3) could have been discovered through a policy that allowed strip searches only in cases of\nindividualized suspicion. With regard to the remaining two reports, it is unclear whether a strip search was\nnecessary for discovery of the contraband; it is also unclear if individualized suspicion existed. Thus, the\ndetention centers' own documentation of contraband discoveries provides absolutely no evidence that\nsuspicionless strip searches were necessary, or even helpful, in any case.\nOther evidence in the record confirms the weakness of the government's arguments. One supervisor testified that\nof the one hundred strip searches she personally conducted, not one yielded evidence of contraband. A director\nof one of the facilities testified that out of 2,500 strip searches performed since that facility was built, only two strip\n243 searches revealed contraband *243 that otherwise would not have been found. Those two recovered items of\ncontraband were a piece of jewelry attached to a child's belly button and cocaine that was discovered in a child's\n[3]\nclothing. Full nudity would not have been necessary to uncover these items.\nThe majority accepts the government's argument that strip searches serve the \"special need\" of deterring\nchildren from smuggling contraband. I agree that, under certain circumstances, deterrence can be a legitimate\nspecial need that will justify some suspicionless searches. See Von Raab, 489 U.S. at 674, 675 n. 3, 109 S.Ct.\n1384; Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. However, the deterrence rationale is not very compelling in this\ncase, particularly when balanced against the degree of the invasion of privacy. While deterrence may be an\nimportant rationale for employees who know they will undergo drug tests, see Von Raab, 489 U.S. at 674, 675 n.\n3, 109 S.Ct. 1384, or for prisoners returning from contact visits with outsiders, see Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99\nS.Ct. 1861, it has little applicability to a person who does not expect to be detained and subjected to a search. \nSee Hunt v. Polk County, Iowa, 551 F.Supp. 339, 344 (S.D.Iowa 1982) (observing that even though a \"rationale\nfor upholding strip searches in [some] cases is that prisoners' awareness of the across-the-board policy will deter\nthem from attempting to smuggle contraband when their next opportunity arises, . . . [t]he deterrence rationale ...\nhas little applicability to a person arrested unexpectedly on the street\"); see also John Does 1-100 v. Boyd, 613\nF.Supp. 1514, 1523 (D.Minn.1985) (finding that \"arrest and confinement ... are wholly unplanned events, so that\nthe defendants' strip search policy can hardly be expected to deter smuggling\"). In Connecticut's juvenile\ndetention centers, it is common for children to be arrested unexpectedly and confined immediately. Trial Tr. at\n127-28. In other cases the juveniles are brought first to their parents, who then must bring them to court. Even in\nthose cases, however, the child does not necessarily expect to be detained, as prosecutors do not seek to have\n[4]\nthe child detained in all cases. Id. at 129. The deterrence rationale might make some sense for re-entry\nsearches, given that the detention and the searches are foreseeable by the detainee in those circumstances;\n\nhowever, the majority concedes that re-entry strip searches are unlawful. In any case, even in the limited\n244 circumstances where the deterrence rationale could apply, the government has *244 made no showing that a full\nstrip search 00 rather than other methods of searching 00 is necessary to achieve the desired deterrent effect.\n97 97\nThe evidence regarding the efficacy of strip searches in detecting child abuse is even more scant than the\nevidence of contraband discovered during strip searches. The record contains over twenty-five reports of\nsuspected abuse filled out by center employees. In each report, the employee is asked to \"describe the\ncircumstances in which the injury(ies), maltreatment or neglect came to be known to the reporter.\" Not a single\nreport indicates that a full strip search was the source of the evidence of abuse. Moreover, while the majority\nopinion cites to evidence establishing a high rate of self-mutilation among detainees, I am not aware of any\nevidence in the record discussing the rate at which abuse is discovered during a strip search that otherwise\nwould not have been discovered.\nIn criticizing the government's evidence, I again emphasize that the question is not whether the government's\nconcerns justify a potentially-invasive search of some kind 00 such as a frisk search or a thorough search of all of\n97\na detainee's clothes and possessions 00 in the absence of individualized suspicion. Nor is the question whether\n97\nthe government's concerns justify a full strip search when there is some reasonable suspicion that a particular\njuvenile possesses contraband. The question instead is whether the government's concerns are sufficiently\ncredible and sufficiently weighty to justify a highly degrading, intrusive strip search absent any individualized\nsuspicion that the particular young adolescents ordered by the state to disrobe possess contraband. To that\nquestion, I would respond in the negative.\nI would indicate, however, that the amount of individualized reasonable suspicion that would justify a strip search\nmay be lower in these circumstances than in most contexts. It is my belief that, in most instances, the detention\nfacilities would be able to conduct a strip search if the authorities first gathered information about the juvenile's\nmedical or criminal history, questioned the juvenile about any history of abuse or suicide, and uncovered the\ncircumstances surrounding his or her immediate detention. Such information, I believe, usually would provide the\ngovernment with reasonable individualized suspicion to conduct the search.\nIndeed, it is likely that in the case before us, the officers conducting the strip searches would have had a\nreasonable, individualized suspicion justifying the strip searches had they bothered to investigate the plaintiffs'\npersonal histories and present circumstances. The appellees note that the plaintiffs were potentially suicidal, and\nthat S.C. had been a \"substantial user of narcotics.\" If the juvenile detention centers had performed the strip\nsearches at issue based on reasonable, individualized suspicions rooted in the dangerous tendencies of the\nplaintiffs, I might not question their authority to do so. But this question is not before us. The district court made\n[5]\nno findings as to what the officials knew or what information was available to them at the time of the search,\nand the appellees do not argue to us that the searches were based on reasonable suspicion; their arguments on\nappeal are only that the searches were reasonable even in the absence of any individualized suspicion. We\n245 cannot employ hindsight to determine whether the searches at issue here were reasonable. If the information \n*245 causing reasonable suspicion was unknown or irrelevant to the person performing the search, it is not part\nof our determination of \"reasonableness\" under the Fourth Amendment. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21-22, 88\nS.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (\"[I]t is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard:\nwould the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search `warrant a man of reasonable\ncaution in the belief' that the action taken was appropriate?\") (internal citation omitted); Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S.\n89, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964) (holding seizure under Fourth Amendment reasonable if the facts known\nto the officer at the time of arrest would warrant the belief of a prudent person that the arrestee had committed or\nwas committing a crime); Weber, 804 F.2d at 798 (refusing to entertain argument that reasonable suspicion\nexisted to strip search the plaintiff, a misdemeanor arrestee, because, inter alia, defendants \"concede that\npursuant to jail policy a jail employee undertook a strip/body cavity search ... in the absence of any ground other\nthan her status as an arrested person\").\nIt is too much of a departure from our prior cases and too great an extension of the special needs doctrine to say\nthat any of the strip searches at issue here were justified absent individualized suspicion. Because I believe that\nthe entry searches, like the re-entry searches, do not \"fit within the closely guarded category of constitutionally\npermissible suspicionless searches,\" Chandler v, Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 309, 117 S.Ct. 1295, 137 L.Ed.2d 513\n\n(1997), I respectfully dissent from the majority's finding that the first, fourth, and eighth strip searches of S.C. and\nthe first strip search of T.W. were lawful.\n[1] In Connecticut a \"minor\" is a person under the age of eighteen. Conn. Gen.Stat. § 1-1d.\n[2] The other person must be thirteen years of age or older and not more than two years older or younger than\nthe child in question. Conn. Gen.Stat. § 46b-120(8)(E).\n[3] The Policy defines \"contraband\" as \"[a]nything not authorized to be in a detainee's possession, anything used\nin an unauthorized or prohibited manner; anything altered in any way or anything in excess of allowable limits.\"\n[4] \"Strip search\" is often used as an umbrella term that applies to all inspections of naked individuals. Various\nother phrases have been used depending on how the search is conducted. A \"visual body-cavity search\" usually\nmeans visual inspection of a naked body, including genitals and anus, without any contact. See Security and Law\nEnforcement Employees v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187, 192 (2d Cir.1984). A \"manual body-cavity search\" generally\nmeans an inspection of a naked body, including genitals and anus, by means of touching or probing with an\ninstrument. See Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n. 3 (1st Cir.1985). Unless otherwise indicated, we will use\nthe term \"strip search\" to mean the type of search, without visual or manual body-cavity inspection, currently\nauthorized by the Policy.\n[5] The Plaintiffs acknowledge that strip searches could lawfully be conducted upon admission of those juveniles\nincarcerated for offenses that would be felonies if they were adults and those reasonably suspected of\npossession of contraband. Otherwise, they contend that a thorough pat and frisk adequately serves the State's\nlegitimate interests.\n[6] Despite the District Court's statement that the Policy violated the Fourth Amendment, the Court's judgment\ncontains no declaration to that effect. The judgment states only that it is \"entered for the defendants and both\ncases are closed.\" We therefore have no occasion to review any ruling with respect to the facial unlawfulness of\nthe Policy.\n[7] The phrase \"special needs,\" in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, originated in Justice Blackmun's concurring\nopinion in New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 351, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985).\n[8] The contact visit apparently provided a generalized, though not an individualized, basis for concern that the\ninmate might have acquired contraband. This suggests that, as to those lawfully confined, a specific basis for\nconcern about contraband will support strip searches, even absent a basis for individualized suspicion. One\nJustice appears to attach little, if any, importance to the fact that the searches in Wolfish were limited to inmates\nafter contact visits. In granting a stay as Circuit Justice, then-Justice Rehnquist viewed Wolfish as applying\nFourth Amendment standards \"to the practice of conducting strip-searches of persons detained after being\ncharged with a crime.\" Clements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304, 1309, 102 S.Ct. 284, 70 L.Ed.2d 461 (chambers\nopinion), vacated,454 U.S. 1117, 102 S.Ct. 961, 71 L.Ed.2d 105 (1981).\n[9] Although the Supreme Court used the phrase \"parens patriae,\" it appears to have been referring to the state's\nresponsibility when acting in loco parentis.\n[10] One child psychologist, testifying at the trial, agreed that, at least \"in theory,\" it would be traumatic for a child\nwho had been sexually assaulted to be forced to expose her body to another individual. A recent study found that\n29 percent of Connecticut's female juvenile detainees reported having been sexually abused. See John F.\nChapman, Sherrie Wasilesky & Michael Zuccaro, \"Assessment of the Psychiatric Needs of Children in\nConnecticut's Juvenile Detention Centers: A Report to the Deputy Chief Court Administrator's Task Force on\nOvercrowding\" 23 (Nov. 27, 2000).\n[11] In papers submitted after oral argument in response to the Court's inquiry, the Defendants contend that strip\nsearches are not conducted upon arrival at one institution after transfer from another institution. See Letter from\nTerrence M. O'Neill, Ass't Attorney General, to Hon. Sonia Sotomayor of Sept. 4, 2003, at 3. However, the\nevidence is to the contrary. The testimony the Defendants cite stated only that a search was not performed when\nan inmate was transferred out of an institution, not that there was no search upon arrival at the new institution.\n\n[12] A supervisor at JFS testified that a strip search was performed after transportation from NHJDC because it\nwould be \"foolish\" to rely on the searching at NHJDC and because contraband might have been picked up during\ntransport or off the desk of a probation officer. One of the managers of Juvenile Forensic Services, LLP testified\nthat an inmate of JFS once admitted that she stole a paper clip during a court appearance and used it to mutilate\nherself while being transported in a van back to JFS.\n[13] Since the pencils were numbered, it would not have been difficult to keep track of which girls had which\npencils, thereby pinpointing the girl who had not turned in the missing pencil.\n[14] Interestingly, in formulating the standard of \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,\" Turner\nreferred only to the Wolfish prisoners' affirmative claim to receive books, see Turner, 482 U.S. at 87, 107 S.Ct.\n2254, and made no mention of their claim to be free of strip searches conducted after contact visits.\n[15] The fact that the searches discovered such items infrequently does not lessen the State's interest. With\njuveniles often brought to detention facilities on multiple occasions, many would become familiar with the\nsearches, and the few instances of finding dangerous items may well indicate how effective the State's policy is\nas a deterrent.\n[16] The Policy states that its intention is \"to control contraband and detect potential illicit activities.\" Despite the\nabsence of detecting abuse in the Policy's statement of purposes and the disclaimer of such a purpose by the\nassistant supervisor at NHJDC, the Defendants contend on appeal that finding abuse is a purpose of strip\nsearches, Br. of Appellees at 14, and not merely a helpful consequence. The State official responsible for\npromulgating the Policy testified that detecting abuse was one of its purposes.\n[1] Since commencement of the suit, the strip search procedure has been altered to make it less intrusive.\nDetainees no longer are required to squat and cough, and they may wear a robe during the search, though the\nofficials still inspect all parts of their body. The issue before us, however, is the reasonableness of the searches\nas they were conducted, not the reasonableness of the newly revised policy.\n[2] According to the defendants, ninety percent of the female juvenile detainees have suffered \"some form of\nabuse or neglect,\" and sixty-two percent have screened positive for mental health conditions requiring further\nevaluation. Seventy-five percent have been diagnosed with \"significant emotional difficulties.\"\n[3] The government's brief cites additional incidents of the discovery of contraband to justify the strip searches,\nbut the facts surrounding those incidents do not demonstrate the necessity of full strip searches in the absence of\nindividualized suspicion. For example, the government's brief discusses a girl with a history of self-mutilation who\nconcealed a diaper pin in her bra. The government's brief fails to mention, however, that (1) the pin was not\ndiscovered during a strip search, and (2) a policy of allowing full strip searches only when based on individualized\nsuspicion would have been sufficient to discover the diaper pin, given that officials had already learned of the\ngirl's self-destructive tendencies by observing her arms and ankles.\n[4] In the case now before us, T.W. testified that she had not expected to be sent to detention even though she\nhad been brought to court. As for S.C., her testimony does not suggest that she knew of the strip search policy\nbefore she arrived at the detention center for the first time; nor does the record clearly establish that she knew\nthe police were coming to detain her on the first two occasions that they did so. (On the third occasion, she\nturned herself in.) Moreover, detention facility officials did not strip search S.C. after her single private visit with\noutsiders, even though that is precisely the sort of circumstance in which the deterrence rationale for strip\nsearches would seem to apply with the most force.\n[5] The officers did ask limited questions before some of the searches, but the record reveals few details about\nthe content of these questions. There is nothing to suggest that the questions played any role in the decision\nwhether to conduct a strip search.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
