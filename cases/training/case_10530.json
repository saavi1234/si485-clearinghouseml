    "summary": "<p>On September 12, 1996, two female prisoners filed a Section 1983 lawsuit in U.S. District Court District of New Mexico, seeking damages for being subjected to strip searches by male guards at the Bernalillo County Detention Center.  Plaintiffs claimed that the strip searches were unconstitutional and in violation of jail policy and that women at the jail were subjected to strip searches more than male prisoners.  Plaintiffs asserted claims for violations of their rights secured by the Fourth Amendment, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and New Mexico state law.</p><p>A jury trial was held on October 27 though 30, 1997.  The District Court (Magistrate Judge Don J. Svet) granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants on Counts I (Fourth Amendment claim), II (Substantive Due Process claim) and III (Equal Protection claim) on the grounds that those claims were barred by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997 et seq.  Judge Svet held that plaintiffs' claimed injuries, migraine headaches and emotional distress that induced attempted suicide, did not satisfy the physical injury requirement of the PLRA.  The court stated:  \"a few hours of lassitude and nausea and the discomfort of having her stomach pumped is no more than a de minimus physical injury.\"  Plaintiffs also failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as further required by the PLRA.  The jury was unable to reach a verdict on Count IV and a mistrial was declared.  In its Memorandum Opinion and Order dated November 11, 1996, the District Court memorialized the basis for entry of judgment for defendants on Counts I, II and III.  </p><p>The case was reset for trial on Count IV.</p><p>The PACER docket indicates that a settlement conference was held before Magistrate Robert J. DeGiacomo  on February 9, 1998 at which time the case settled.  The parties were given two weeks to prepare the necessary closing papers.  On April 3, 1998, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the case.  We do not have copies of the closing papers, so the terms of the settlement are unknown.</p><p></p>",

No. 96-1257 DJSIRLP \nCITY OF ALBUQUERQUE, SGT. WILL BELL, \nLT. SCOTT KERR, \nDefendants. \nNOV 1 71997 \ntP~~~.ยฃ \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  ClERIC \nTInS MAT  IER comes before the Court upon Defendants' motion for judgment as a \nmatter of law made at the close of Plaintiff's evidence and at the close of all evidence in the \njury trial held in this matter from October 27, 1997 to October 30, 1997. Defendant sought \njudgment as a matter of law on Counts I. ll, and III of the complaint. arguing the provisions of \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. ยงl997 el seq .. \nThis action is a suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 by which Plaintiffs seek damages for \nalleged violations of their Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches, Due \nProcess, and Equal Protection. Plaintiffs also assert claims pursuant to the New Mexico State \nTort Claims Act for assault and battery. Plaintiffs allege that on June 14, 1996. they were \nsubjected to strip searches at the BemaliUo County Octencion Center (BCDC). Plaintiffs \nfurther aUege that those searches were observed or conducted by Defendants Scott and Bell, \nthat women jailed at BCDC are subjected to strip searches more frequently than male iruna1es, \n1 \nS't6S 99C  S0S  t  .().I  ~ \n\nand that their strip searches were conducted in a manner contrary to the wriucn policy of the \njail. \nPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1) \"If during a trial by jury a party has been fully \nheard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to \nftnd for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may \ngrant a motion for judgment as a matter of law. ... \". \nDefendants motion was initially made at the close of Plaintiffs evidence. The Court \ngranted the motion as to Count I and Count IT of the complaint at that time, reserving ruling as \nto Count III of the complaint. At the close of aU evidence. Defendant renewed the motion. \nwhich was then granted as to Count m of the complaint. \nCOUNT I FOURTH AMENDMENT CLAIM \nPlaintiffs assert that they were deprived of their Fourth Amendment right to be free \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures because rhe strip searches were conducted without \nreasonable suspicion to believe that they were carrying contraband and because the strip \nsearches were done by the male Defendants Ot' in their presence. Plaintiffs presented evidence \nthat the male officers wereยท present or assisted in their strip search. \nPrisoners retain a limited right to bodily privacy, particularly as to searches viewed or \nconducted by members of the opposite sex. Han!!; Vt  Mamou. 70 F.3d 1144, 1145 (lOth Cir. \n1995)(citations omitted). The test for reasonableness of a prisoner search under the Fourth \nAmendment \"is not capable of precise definition. In each case it requires a balancing of the \nneed for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. \nCourts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it was \n2 \n\nconducted, the justification-for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Bell v. \nWolfish. 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). Before the question of whether the searches were \nreasonable could be reached. the Court granted judgment as a matter of law on the basis that \nPlaintiffs had not presented evidence that they suffered from a physical injury and were \ntherefore precluded from obtaining relief pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act of \n1996. \nPlaintiff Sharon Moya testified that. as a result of the strip search. she began to suffer \nmipaa beadacbes. wbieh she IUffen to tbis day . ..,... testified a~ to the emotionalยท \n.1Ue.la41D111lat aapisb ...s ta1rered .. a. result of the suip seackยท No,medical evidc.  .. \nwu preaeaMCi ~.Mopยทa.~;,. ~I.talifiectwaw seJ1\"CU'Il'OSC'd~ Moya \ntestified that she suffepredn nuo _con tusions. scrapes. marks, or other injuries during the search. \nE9Jde .....  dlltpaau.ift Lisa ~ aacmptect,toCOIDDlif suicide sbortl! \n._. ..~.  ..I IIip'I'''c:IIecIt Martinez took a quantity of non-prescription medication in this \nsuicide attempt and was taken to the hospital to have her stomach pumped and for observation. \nHowever. no evidence was prescnteci that Lisa Martinez suffered any bruises. marks, scrapes. \nor other physical injuries in the course of her strip search. Martinez tcstif1CCl that she took the \npills because she felt shocked and humiliated. \n42 U.S.C. ยง1997(e)(e) states that \"No Federal civil action may be brought by a \nprisoner confined in a jail. prison, or other correctional facility. for menta) or emotional injury \nsuffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\" No evidence was \npresented which indicated a physical injury to either Plaintiff which was inflicted by \nDefendants. A claim of mental anguish docs not state a claim for relief pursuant to me \n3 \n\nrequirement of 42 U.S.C. ยง1997(e) as amended by the Prison Litigation Reform Act. Vouni \ny  Knight, 113 F.3d 1248 (table), 1997 WL 297692 (lOth Cir. 1997) (unpublished). \nFurther. more than a de minimis physical injury is required by ยง1997(e){e). Sia1ar v. \nHiahtQwer. 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997) (Bruised ear lasting 3-4 days an insufficient \ninjury to meet the requirements of the PLRA). Even if the Court were to consider any injury \nto Lisa Martinez as a result of her attempted suicide as a qualifying physical injury under the \nstatute, ~ few hours of \\.,siNde anAยท DIusea and the discomfort of having her stomach pumped \nis DO mOre dwla 44 mbtiIIIis physicaliDjury. Similarly; dle mere fact that Slmron Moya no. \nsuftCrs hacfac:I!ea wIlicIl'''' auritJafD .1fle stress of her strip sead is not โข serious physical \nf QUary.,ilFollowing the guidance of~. such injuries are insufficient to overcome the hurdle \nposed by ยง1997(e)(e). \nCOUNT II,  SUBSTANTlVE DUE PROCESS \nn \nIn Count  of the Complaint, Plaintiffs assert that their suip searches were \nunreasonable invasions of their privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause. \nAs part of this cause of action, Plaintiffs assert that the City of Albuquerque created liberty \nand pTOperty interests by means of its written policies regarding strip searches. which policieS \nwere violated. \nViolation of a police department regulation is insufficient to create liability under \nยง1983. Wilson v' Meeks. 52 F.3cllS47. 1554 (lOth Cir. 1995). Further, violations of state \nlaw anc1 police procedure do not give rise to a ยง1983 claim. Romero y. Boaed of Co. Comm .. \n(lam \n60 F.3d 702. 70S  Cir. 1995). Also. the fact that police conduct did not comply with \nregulacions or (relining docs not create constirutionalliability under ยง 1983  Diaz v. Salazar, \nI \n4 \nnlJl:1  :  woa.:l \n\n924 F.Supp. 1088, 1097 (O.N.M. 1996). Accordingly, Defendant's failure to follow jail \npolicy does not create liability under ยง 1983. \nIn the Tenth Circuit \"a government official violaces an individual's Fourteenth \nAmendment rights by injuring his or her life, liberty. or property interest with deliberate or \nreckless intent.\" Webber v. Mefford. 43 F.3d 1340. 1343 (lOth Cir. 1994); see also  Medina \nv. City and County of Denver. 960 F.2d 1493, 1496 (lOth Cit. 1992). \"An act is reckless \nwhen it reflects a wanton or obdurate disregard or complete indifference to risk, for example \n'when the actor does not care whether the other person lives or dies, despite knowing that \nthere is a significant risk of death' or grievous bodily injury.\" ld.. at 1496 (quoting Archie v. \nCity otRacine, 847 F.2d 1211, 1219 (7th Cir.1988) (en baneยป. Whether the conduct of the \njail guards \"shocks the conscience\" is immaterial to this analysis. ~ Rowe v. City of \nMarlowe. Ok โข 116 F.3d 1489, 1997 WL 353001 (10th Cir. 1997)(unpublished disposition). \nPlaintiffs presented no evidence which would show that Defendants acted with deliberate or \nreckless intent. \nFurther. the more specific protection provided by the Fourth Amendment. rather than \nthe generali~e protection of the Due Process doctrine, supplies the standard which should be \nused in (his case. ~ Whitley y, Albers. 475 U.S, 312, 327 (1986) (refusing to consider a \nFourteenth Amendment due process claim by a prison inmate for excessive force because the \nEighth Amendment \"serves as the primary source of substantive protection to convicted \nprisoners\" in such cases); KG ~ AlbriJht v, Oliver,S 10 U.S. 266, 272 (l994)(Holding that \nthe Fourth Amendment addmses pretrial deprivations of liberty, rather than the generalized \n5 \n\nFROM  HCLU \nlanguage found it the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.) Plaintiffs' claim that \nthey were denied substantive due process fails as a matter of law. \nThe PLRA provides an additional ground upon which the Court granted Defendanrs' \nmotion for judgment as a matter of law as to Plaintiff,;' due process claim. 42 U.S.C. \nยง1997(e)(a) provides that \"No action shall be brought wich respect to prison conditions under \nยง1983 of this title. or any other Federal law. by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or \nother correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted. \nn \nDefendants provided evidence that a grievance procedure is available and made known [0 \nresidents of the Bernalillo County Detention Center. That procedure includes not only \nprovisions tor bringing a grievance to a griev~e board, but the appeal of an unfavorable \nopinion by the board to the Director of the jail. \nEvidence at trial indicated that Plaintiff Sharon Moya made a written statement \nfollowing the incident and provided the statement to a supervisor at the jail. An investigation \nof Plaintiffs' allegations was conducted by jail officials. Even if Maya's actions are construed \nto be an effort to take advantage of available grievance procedures, she did not exhaust \navailable administrative remedies. The Director of BCDe, Michael Sisneros, testified that no \nappeal of any grievance procedure concerning the strip searches was ever made to him. \nPlaintiff Lisa Martinez complained of the strip search to a Psychiatric Services Unit \nworker. That worker told her that she would make a report regardina the incident. Once again, \nthe formal grievance procedure was not followed. Further, if Martinez's actions are construed \nas seeking administrative remedies, those remedies were not exhausted because no appeal was \ntaken to Director Sisneros. \n6 \n\nAdditionally. Plaintiffs each testitied that they were not aware of the grievance \nprocedures available at the time of the incidents. Plaintiff Moya's action of providing a written \nstatement to a jail supervisor and Plaintiff Martinez's complaint to the Psychiatric Services \nOfficer cannot reasonably be construed as attempts to exhaust administrative remedies of \nwhich Plaintiffs were not, by their own testimony, aware. The fact that Plaintiffs were not \nawarc of jail grievance procedures does not relieve thcm of the requirement to exhaust those \nremedies under. the terms of the statute. Further, Director Sisneros' testimony that information \nregarding grievance procedures is made available to all prisoners at BeDC was not \ncontroverted. \nPlaintiffs argue that they arc not bringing a suit involving \"prison conditions\" under \nthe terms of the starute. However, to the extent that their Due Process claim relies upon the \nfailure to follow the wrincn policy of the jail, that challenge is to a practice within the jailor \n\"prison condition\". \nPlaintiffs also argue that filing a grievance would be futile, in part because damages are \nnot available under the administrative procedure. However, in an unpublished decision. the \nTenth Circuit said: \nAlthough (plaintiff) concedes that he did not exhaust his remedies, he \nยซ \ncontends that it was improper to dismiss his case on such a technicality.  The \nrequiremem for exhaustion is not just a technicality.  It is the: law which federal \ncourts are required to follow.\" \nGrimsJ\" v. RockCQuez, 113 .F.3d 1246 (table), 1997 WL 235613 (10th Cir. \n1997)(unpublished decision). Plaintiffs' arguments arc unavailing andjudgmcnt as a matter of \nlaw is appropriate as to this claim. \n7 \nses \nSt6S 99Z  t \n\nCOUNT III  FOURTEENTH Al'\\4ENDMENT EQUAL PROTECTION \nPlaintiffs assert that female inmates at BCne are not afforded full protection of the \nCity's written policies on strip searches. Plaintiffs also presented evidence that the City has \nplaced plaques in the pods housing women which inform inmates that they should expect to be \nstrip searched any time they are taken off the level and taken to recreation, court, the library, \nto dental or to medical examinations. Plaintiffs presented evidence. which was controverted, \nthat male inmates are not provided the same wamin& or subjected to the same searches. \nThe Court granted judg1llCnt as a matter of law as to this claim on the basis of 42 \nU.S.C. ยง1997(e)(a). Plaintiffs presented no evidence that they exhausted available \nadministrative remedies regarding their claim that conditions for female residents at the \nBernalillo County Derention Center differ from conditions for male residents. As discussed, \nsupra, they are therefore precluded from bringing an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 \nregarding that assenion. \nCONSTITUTIONALITY \nPlaintiffs argue that the PLRA is unconstitutional. First, they contend that the PLRA \nviolates the separation of powers clause, analogizing to Ci1Y ofDoeme v. P.E.Flores, 117 \nS.Cr. 2157. 2163 (l997){striking down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) and \nconrendina tbal Congress is attempting to interpret the Fourth, Fourteenth. and Eighth \nAmendments. However. the PLRA does not limit constitutional rights. but rather one's ability \nto recover damages for those rights under 42 U.S.C. 11983. which ability is a statutory \nconstruct. In the absence of ยง1983, injunctive relief from the Couns  prevent continuing \n(0 \nviolation of one's constitutional rights would, presumably, be available. \na \nZld Wdยฃยฃ:ยฃ0 8661  ยฃZ  'uer \n\n.. \n.  Plaintiffs also argue that the PLRA is unconstitutional because it violates the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Constitution by making it more difficult for prisoner. as compared to \nall others seeking redress through the Federal courts, to make a constitutional claim. Plaintiffs' \nargument is based upon a strict scrutiny analysis. Plaintiffs' Bench Memo. p. 10. \nThe problem with this argument is that so far as treating prisoners differently than \nt \nnonprisoners. Equal Protection claims merit only a rational basis review; that is, whether the \nclassification that results in unequal treatments bears some rational relationship to a legitimate \nstate purpose. ~ Moran v. U.S., 18 F.3d 412.413 (7th Cit. 1994); ~ ils.Q Jlnited States y. \nWoods, 888 F.2d 653, 656 (10th Cir. 1989)(pre-sentcnce residents of halfway houses are not a \nsuspect class in terms of Equal Protection analysis); Moreland v.
