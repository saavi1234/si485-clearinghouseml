OF ALABAMA\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \n,  SOUTHERN DIVISION \nRICHARD GOODEN, et al.,  ) \n) \nPlaintiffs,  ) \n) \nv.  )  CASE NO. 2:05-CV-02562-WMA \n) \nNANCY WORLEY, et al.,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \nORDER \nPlaintiffs Richard Gooden, Andrew Jones, and Ekeysto Doss have sued defendants Nancy \nWorley, in her official capacity as Alabama Secretary of State; Nell Hunter, in her official \ncapacity as Jefferson County Voter Registrar; and Anita Gibson, Walter Long, and Molly \nMeadows, in their official capacities as Houston County Voter Registrars.  The plaintiffs seek a \ndeclaratory judgment that the defendants are violating Section V of the Voting Rights Act of \n1965,42 U.S.C. § 1973c1 by denying the plaintiffs the right to vote because oftheir felony \n1Section V of the Voting Rights Act states, in relevant part: \nWhenever a State or political subdivision with respect to which the prohibitions \nset forth in section 1973b(a) of this title based upon determinations made under \nthe first sentence of section 1973b(b) of this title are in effect shall enact or seek \nto administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, \npractice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect \non November 1, 1964, ... such State or subdivision may institute an action in the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory \njudgment that such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure \ndoes not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the \nright to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set \nforth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, and unless and until the court enters such \njudgment no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with \nsuch qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure: Provided, That \nsuch qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure may be enforced \nwithout such proceeding if the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or \nprocedure has been submitted by the chief legal officer or other appropriate \n\nconvictions.  Plaintiffs have also requested an award of reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and \ncosts under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973l(e) and 1988.  The parties have stipulated to the relevant facts in \nthis case and both sides have moved for the court to enter a judgment as a matter of law. \n\"Summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows no genuine issue of material fact \nand that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. When deciding whether \nsummary judgment is appropriate, all evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn \ntherefrom are reviewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\"  Korman v. HBC Fla., \nInc., 182 F.3d 1291, 1293 (11th Cir. 1999) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \nArticle VIII, section 177(b) ofthe Alabama Constitution provides that a person who has \nbeen convicted of a felony \"involving moral turpitude\" shall not have the right to vote until their \ncivil rights have been restored.  Normally, a convicted felon proves that his civil rights have been \nrestored with a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote (\"Certificate of Eligibility\") from the \nBoard of Pardons and Paroles.  When Alabama adopted this provision to its constitution, it \nreceived appropriate preclearance from the U.S. Attorney General pursuant to Section V ofthe \nofficial of such State or subdivision to the Attorney General and the Attorney \nGeneral has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, \nor upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days \nafter such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such \nobjection will not be made. \n(emphasis in original).  \"To determine whether there have been changes with respect to voting, \nwe must compare the challenged practices with those in existence before they were adopted. \nAbsent relevant intervening changes, the Act requires us to use practices in existence on \nNovember 1, 1964, as our standard of comparison.\" Presley v. Etowah County Comm 'n, 502 \nU.S. 491, 495, 112 S. Ct. 820, 825, 117 L .Ed. 2d 51 (1992). \n2 \n\nVoting Rights Act. \nThe Alabama Attorney General clarified in Op. Ala. Att'y Gen. 2005-092 (2005) which \nfelonies would require a Certificate ofEligibility (i.e., which involved moral turpitude) as a \nprerequisite for felons registering to vote.  While the Attorney General did not provide an \nexhaustive list of felonies involving moral turpitude, he did provide some examples and \nspecifically stated that felony possession of drugs and driving under the influence were not \nfelonies involving moral turpitude.  Furthermore, the Attorney General stated that if a felon had \nbeen convicted of a crime not involving moral turpitude, that individual remained eligible to vote \nand therefore ineligible to apply for a Certificate of Eligibility.  Nevertheless, the plaintiffs \ncontend that the Secretary of State directed registrars in twenty counties to not register any felon \nto vote without a Certificate of Eligibility, regardless of whether the felons had committed \nfelonies involving moral turpitude.  The plaintiffs all allege that they were not permitted to \nregister to vote without Certificates of Eligibility because of felony convictions that did not \ninvolve moral turpitude. 2  The plaintiffs allege that the defendants, in refusing to apply the moral \nturpitude qualification to when a Certificate of Eligibility is required, are employing a procedure \nthat violates the Voting Rights Act because the U.S. Attorney General has not precleared the \nprocedure pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1973c.  Plaintiffs contend that such preclearance is required \nbecause the defendants' refusal to apply the moral turpitude qualification constitutes a change \nfrom Alabama's status quo reflected in article VIII, section 177. \n2 \nThe parties have stipulated that the plaintiffs were convicted of the following: Gooden \nwas convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), Jones was convicted of felony \npossession of drugs, and Doss was convicted of felony possession of marijuana and theft of \nproperty in the second degree. \n3 \n\nThe defendants dispute plaintiffs' claims.  Worley argues that, as the Secretary of State, \nshe merely provided advice and had no authority to direct the registrars, and thus such advice \ncould not constitute a change in voting practices.  Furthermore, her advice was merely to \nmaintain, not change, the status quo.  Gibson, Long, and Meadows adopt this argument and \nadditionally argue that the federal court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over Doss's \nclaim because Doss had an effective means of redress through state courts.  They also point out \nthat Doss's request for relief is moot because the Houston County Board of Registrars has \nalready adopted Doss's requested changes.  We do not need to address these arguments' merits, \nhowever, because we agree with all of the defendants in their assertion that the plaintiffs lack \nstanding to bring this cause of action. \nIn the context of redistricting litigation, the Supreme Court has explained standing \nrequirements as follows: \nIt is by now well settled that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing \ncontains three elements.  First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact-an \ninvasion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and particularized, and \n(b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypotheticaL  Second, there must be a \ncausal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of. . . . Third, \nit must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be \nredressed by a favorable decision. \nUnited States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737,742-43, 115 S. Ct. 2431,2435, 132 L. Ed. 2d 635 (1995) \n(internal quotations and citations omitted).  A \"generalized grievance against allegedly illegal \ngovernment conduct\" cannot support standing.  !d.  Furthermore, declaratory relief is not \navailable to remedy past conduct, when there is no claim that an ongoing violation of law is \nharming the plaintiffs.  See Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 73, 108 S. Ct. 423, 428, 88 LEd. 2d \n371 (1985).  The party claiming standing has the burden of establishing it Hayes, 515 U.S. at \n4 \n\n743, 115 S. Ct. at 2435. \nNone of the plaintiffs have standing in this case because they are either currently \nregistered to vote or would not have been eligible to vote had they obtained their requested relief. \nDoss has no standing because one of his felony convictions was for theft of property in the \nsecond degree, which is a crime involving moral turpitude.  See Ex parte Bankhead, 585 So. 2d \n112, 122 (Ala. 1991) (\"Larceny (now known in our Code as theft), petit or grand, is a crime of \nmoral turpitude ....\" ).  Therefore, even if Doss obtained the relief requested, he would still be \nineligible to vote because he was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude and has not obtained a \nCertificate of Eligibility.  Gooden and Jones also do not have standing because they were both \nextended the right to vote prior to filing their action in this case.  When the complaint was filed \non December 19, 2005, the Circuit Court of Jefferson County had already entered an order \ncompelling the Jefferson County Registrar to permit Gooden to register to vote.  The Jefferson \nCounty Registrar had already registered Jones to vote. \nNone of the plaintiffs have a current injury that a favorable decision could remedy. \nBecause the plaintiffs are basically complaining of past conduct at this point in the litigation, they \ndo not have standing. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs request for declaratory relief is DENIED; plaintiffs' request for \nreasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs is DENIED; all other relief that the plaintiffs have \nrequested is DENIED; and the defendants' motions for summary judgment are GRANTED. \nCosts are taxed against  the plaintiffs. \n5 \n\n,. \nzt, \nDONE this  day ofMay, 2006. \n~1~~ \nCHARLES R.

Introduction\n“The right tovote freelyfor the candidate of one's choice is of\ntheessenceof a democraticsociety,and anyrestrictionson that\nrightstrikeattheheartofrepresentativegovernment.” Reynolds\nv. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1378 (1964).\nYet the power of a state to generally restrict felons’ right to vote has withstood\nconstitutional challenge. In Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S.24, 56,94 S. Ct. 2655, 2671\n(1974), the Supreme Court held that Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment allows states\nto \"exclude from the franchise convicted felons. . . .\"1\nThereare limitations tothe State’sabilityto restrict felons’ voting rights, however,\nas shown by Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 105 S.Ct. 1916 (1985). There, the\nSupreme Court affirmed the Eleventh Circuit’s opinion striking down the former Article\n1\nAlabamahashistoricallyemployedoneofthenation'sstrictestdisenfranchisementregimesandhasa\ncorrespondinglyhighdisenfranchisementrate. Note,DevelopmentsintheLaw(PartVI):OnePerson,NoVote:The\nLawsofFelonDisenfranchisement,115Harv.L.Rev.1939,1943(May2002). Accordingtoonecommentator,\n6.75%ofAlabama'svoting-agepopulationcannotvote. Id.at1943-44,citingChristopherUggen&JeffManza, The\nPoliticalConsequencesofFelonDisenfranchisementLawsintheUnitedStates23(Aug.31,2001)(unpublished\nmanuscript,onfilewiththeHarvardLawSchoolLibrary).\n\nVIII,§182,oftheAlabamaConstitutionof1901. Thatconstitutionalprovisionhadprovided\nfor the disenfranchisement of persons convicted of certain enumerated felonies and\nmisdemeanors, as well as “any . . . crime involving moral turpitude.” The basis for the\nholding in Hunter v. Underwood was that racial discrimination was a substantial or\nmotivating factor in the adoption of Section 182.\nIn so holding, the Supreme Court affirmed the Eleventh Circuit’s opinion of\nUnderwood v. Hunter, 730 F.2d 614 (11th Cir. 1984). The Eleventh Circuit’s opinion\nincludedsomefacts similar tothose ofthis case, whichled toa pointed observationby that\ncourt:\nIndeterminingwhetheranoffenseisacrimeofmoralturpitude,\nthe registrars follow Alabama case law and, in the absence of\njudicial decision, opinions of the state attorney general. The\nregistrars' actions in this case were based on opinions of the\nattorney general. In Pippin v. State, 197 Ala. 613, 73 So. 340\n(1916), the Alabama Supreme Court defined a crime of moral\nturpitudeas anactthat is “immoralitself, regardlessof the fact\nwhetheritispunishableby law. Thedoingoftheactitself,and\nnotits prohibition by statute,fixes the moral turpitude.” Id. at\n616, 73 So. at 342 (quoting Fort v. City of Brinkley, 87 Ark.\n400, 112 S.W. 1084 (1908)). The attorney general in opinion\nhas acknowledged that the classification of presently\nunaddressedoffenses“will turnuponthemoralstandardsof the\njudgeswho decidethe question.” Pl.Exh.3;see alsoinfra note\n13. “Thus does the serpent of uncertainty crawl into the Eden\noftrial administration.” McCormick,McCormickonEvidence\n§ 43, at 85-86 (2d ed. 1972).\n730 F.2d at 616 n. 2.\nTheStateofAlabamarespondedtoHunterv.UnderwoodbypassingAmendment579\nto the Alabama Constitution in 1996. This amendment provides the following:\nArticle VIII of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 is hereby\nrepealed and in lieu thereof the following article shall be\nadopted.\n(a) Everycitizen of the United States who has attained the age\nof eighteen years and has resided in this state and in a county\n2\n\nthereofforthetimeprovidedbylaw,ifregisteredasprovidedby\nlaw, shall have the right to vote in the county of his or her\nresidence. The Legislature may prescribe reasonable and\nnondiscriminatoryrequirementsas prerequisitestoregistration\nfor voting. The Legislature shall, by statute, prescribe a\nprocedure bywhich eligible citizens can register to vote.\n(b) Nopersonconvictedof afelonyinvolvingmoralturpitude,\norwho is mentallyincompetent,shall bequalifiedtovote until\nrestoration of civil andpolitical rights or removal of disability.\n(c) The Legislature shall by lawprovide forthe registration of\nvoters,absenteevoting,secrecy invoting,theadministration of\nelections, and the nomination of candidates.\nThe term “moral turpitude” is nowhere defined in that amendment.\nThe plaintiffshere have brought suit challenging certain practices that have arisen\nsince passage of Amendment 579. There is no challenge here like that of the Hunter v.\nUnderwood case. The plaintiffs raise no claim of racial discrimination surrounding the\npassage of that amendment, nor do they claim that there exists an impermissible\ndiscriminatoryimpact.\nInstead,thissuit initiallyfocusedonthe factthatstateand countyofficials haveused\nanoverlyexpansiveinterpretation of Amendment 579tobar allfelons –and notjustthose\nconvicted of crimes involving moral turpitude – from registering to vote. On behalf of a\nputative classcomprising “all unregisteredpersons otherwise eligible to register to votein\nAlabamawhohavebeenconvictedof oneormorefeloniesbutwhohavenotbeenconvicted\nof any felonies involving moral turpitude,” the named plaintiffs have now raised the\nfollowing causes of action, as found in their Fourth Amended Complaint:\n1. Thedefendants’ alleged refusal to register class members violates the rights\nof each class member under Amendment 579 andAla. Code §17-3-9;\n2. TheAlabamaSecretaryof Statehasalsoallegedlyviolatedtheclassmembers’\nrights under Amendment 579 and Ala.Code § 17-3-9 by misrepresenting to\ncountyregistrars what the voting rights of these members are;\n3. Plaintiffs Richard Gooden and Angela Thomas appeal from the registrars’\nrefusal to register them underAla. Code §17-4-124;\n3\n\n4. The defendants have allegedlyviolatedthe rights of all classmembers under\n42 U.S.C. § 1971(a)(2)(B); and\n5. DefendantWorleyhasallegedlyviolated theclassmembers’ dueprocess and\nequal protection rights by promulgating voter registration forms that fail to\ncomplywith Amendment 579.\nThe Fourth Amended Complaint names Nancy Worley, in her official capacity as\nAlabama’sSecretaryof State,and NellHunter, inherofficial capacityas Jefferson County\nRegistrar, as defendants. Defendant Hunter is further named as a representative of a\ndefendant class defined as all voter registrars in the State of Alabama.2\nOn April 28, 2006, a hearing was held in this matter. The primary focus of the\nhearingwastodetermine whether thisCourt mayproperly certifythe classes allegedby the\nplaintiffs,as must bedecided under Ala. Code§ 6-5-641. The Court took the opportunity\nto hear from the parties on other pending matters, moreover. This order comes from the\nCourt’s consideration of all pending filings and of the arguments made at that hearing.\nTheCourt now faces a situation different from what existed at the time this action\ncommenced. At the April 28 hearing, all parties agreed that a blanket refusal to register a\ncitizen convicted of any felony was contrary to law. Instead, the current procedure is as\ndescribed bycounsel for defendant Worley:\nMS.FLEMING: UnderAlabamalaw,discretionisvestedwith\ntheCountyBoardofRegistrarstoacceptandrejectapplications\nandtodeterminewhichvoterapplicationsmeettherequirements\nof the law. It's -- the statute that speaks to this says that the\nregistrarsare responsiblefordeterminingwhether theapplicant\nhas satisfied the registrars that they in fact meet the\nqualifications for voting. And so what you have is really a\nstatutoryframework that puts the burden,in the first place, on\nthe voter to demonstrate to the CountyBoard of Registrars, in\nthis case, Ms. Hunter, that the voter meets the relevant\n2\nAtthetimeoftheApril28,2006hearing,theplaintiffsweretravelingundertheallegationsoftheFirst\nAmendedComplaint.

That's how the statutes sets the process up in more\ndifficult cases.\n(Transcript of April 28, 2006 hearing, at pp. 12-14).\nII. Undisputed Facts\nA. The Parties’ Stipulated Facts\nAt the April28 hearing, the parties presented a “Stipulation ofUndisputed Facts,”\nwhich identified the following as undisputed:\n1. EachcountyinAlabamahasaboardofthreevoterregistrars,exceptJefferson,\nBarbour, and Talladega counties. Jefferson County has one registrar, while Talladega\nCountyand Barbour Countyeach has four.\n2. In1995-1996,theAlabama Legislatureproposed, andthepeopleratified, Act\n95-443,whichproposedaconstitutionalamendment(ultimately,Amendment579)repealing\nArticle VIII of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 regarding voting.\n3. PlaintiffRichardGoodenisa 64-year-oldAfrican Americanof lawfulvoting\nage,acitizenoftheUnitedStatesand alifetimeresidentofBirmingham,Alabama. Plaintiff\nGoodenwas registered to vote from the mid-1960s until 2000, when he was convicted of\nfelonydriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).\n4. PlaintiffAndrewJonesisa47-year-oldAfricanAmericanoflawfulvotingage,\n5\n\na citizen of the United States and a resident of Birmingham, Alabama. Mr. Jones was\nregisteredtovotefromthemid-1970suntiltheearly1990s,whenhewasconvictedof felony\npossession of drugs.\n5. Ala. Code § 17-4-136 provides as follows: “The Secretary of State may\npromulgate rules for the receipt of applications for registration and the expedient\nadministrationofthoseapplications, butno personshallberegistereduntil amajorityof the\nboard of registrars has passed favorablyupon the person's qualifications.”\n6. DefendantNellHunter,the Jefferson CountyVoterRegistrar, is vested with\nthe authority under Ala. Code § 17-4-136 to grant or refuse an individual's application to\nregister to vote in Jefferson County.\n7. No authority is given to the Secretary of State under Alabama law either to\nregister voters or to direct county boards of registrars with respect to the registration of\nparticularvoters. PursuanttotheAdministrativeCodeofAlabama,however,theSecretary\nof State has removal power over members of boards of registrars.\n8. Byorderof the Alabama Supreme Court, dated October 22, 1999,two voter\nregistrationformswereapprovedpursuanttoAla.Code§17-4-22,assetoutintheAlabama\nCode Commissioner's Notes following that section. The first form is entitled “State of\nAlabamaAgency-BasedVoterRegistrationForm”andisknownat“NVRA-1.” Thesecond\nform is entitled “State of Alabama Postcard Voter Registration Form” and is known as\n“NVRA-2.”\n9. TheSecretary of State makes available Form NVRA-1 (A/B) for use by the\n\"voter registration agencies.\" The Secretary of State makes Form NVRA-2 available for\nprinting and use as a mail-in application for voter registration.\n10. FormsNVRA-1andNVRA-2arevoterregistrationapplicationscontainingthis\nstatement: “to register to vote in the State of Alabama, you must: . . . have not been\nconvicted of a felony, or if you have been convicted, you must have had your civil rights\nrestored.”\n11. Registrars throughout the State use Forms NVRA-1 and NVRA-2, or forms\nsubstantiallysimilar,containing thestatement thattobe eligible tovote,the applicantmust\nnot have been convicted of a felony.\n12. The Secretary of State adopted regulations on January 10, 2001, regulating\nvoter registration. See Ala. Admin. Code,Chapter 820-2-2. Section 820-2-2-.05 provides\n6\n\nthatthe\"voter registrationagencies\"shall usethevoter registrationformsprescribedby the\nSecretaryof State.\n13. Theterm \"voter registration agencies\" refers to those agencies listed in Ala.\nCode§ 17-4-250.\n14. For years prior to 2005, the Jefferson County Registrar had a practice of\ndenying thevoting application of every person convicted of a felony, without first seeking\ntodeterminewhethersuchfelonyhadbeendeterminedbyAlabamacourtsto\"involvemoral\nturpitude,\"and instructed every felon who sought to register to vote in Alabama to seek a\nCertificate of Eligibilityfrom the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n15. It is the current practice of the Jefferson County Registrar to permit felons\nwhose onlyfelony convictions are for crimes that do not involve moral turpitude, as that\nphrase is defined by the appellate courts of Alabama, to register to vote. To determine\nwhether particular felonies involve moral turpitude under Alabama case law, theRegistrar\nconsultsbothAttorneyGeneral'sOpinion2005-092,andattorneys,including staffattorneys\nemployedas Assistant Attorneys Generalinthe Officeof the AttorneyGeneral, as needed.\nTheRegistrardoes notconsult theSecretary of State,whoisnot anattorneyand whois not\nqualified to render legal advice.\n16. OnMarch18,2005,the AlabamaAttorneyGeneralissued Opinion2005-092\nwhich explained that a person convicted of a felonynot involving moral turpitude remains\neligible to vote and is therefore ineligible to apply to the Alabama Board of Pardons and\nParoles for a Certificate of Eligibility.\n17. AftertheissuanceofAttorneyGeneral'sopinion2005-092,theAlabamaBoard\nof Pardons and Paroles (hereafter the “Board”) refused to issue certificates of eligibilityto\npersons who had been convicted of felonies that were specifically identified in Attorney\nGeneral's opinion 2005-092 as crimes not involving moral turpitude.\n18. In a press release dated May 17, 2005, the Board stated that individuals\nconvictedof felonyoffenses notinvolving “moral turpitude,” such as felonydriving under\nthe influence and felony possession of drugs, need not (and, in fact, cannot) apply for a\nCertificate of Eligibilitysince such individuals never lost their right to vote.\n19. AfterAttorneyGeneral'sopinion2005-092wasissued,inresponsetoquestions\nfromvarious boards of registrars, the Secretary of State advised the registrars to continue\ntheirlong-standingpracticesandnottomakeanychangestotheirpracticesuntiltheAttorney\nGeneralissueda responsetolegalquestions posedbythe SecretaryofState andall thelegal\n7\n\nand administrative issues were properlyresolved.\n20. On January 10, 2006, Alabama Attorney General's opinion 2005-092 was\ndistributed by the office of the Attorney General to all the county boards of registrars in\nAlabamabyfacsimileandbyU.S.Mail,andcountyboards ofregistrarswereinvitedtoseek\ntheopinionof the AlabamaAttorneyGeneraliftheyneeded legalassistanceindetermining\nwhether a particular felonyinvolved moral turpitude.\n21. Fromthe time Act 95-443 wasenacted until June 2003, the Office of Voter\nRegistrationwasa separateand distinctstate agencythat wasnotunder the umbrella of the\nOffice of Secretary of State. After June 2003, when the Office of Voter Registration was\nmergedintothe OfficeofSecretary ofState,until herresignation in2004,Anita Tatum, the\nformerDirectoroftheAlabamaOfficeof VoterRegistration,servedastheSupervisorof the\nVoterRegistration Division of the Office of Secretary of State. From 1996 through 2004,\nMs. Tatum and her staff provided all training to the county boards of registrars. No other\ntraining was provided bythe Office of Secretaryof State.\n22. NotwithstandingtheratificationbythepeopleofAlabamaoftheconstitutional\namendmentnarrowingthe scopeof theState'sfelon disfranchisementlaw tothose whohad\nbeenconvicted of crimesof moralturpitude,the AttorneyGeneral'sOpinion, and the press\nrelease issued by the Board, the office of DefendantHunter instructed plaintiff Gooden to\napplyto the Board for a Certificate of Eligibility.\n23. An employee of the Board telephoned the office of Defendant Hunter on\nSeptember21,2005,toexplainthatPlaintiffGoodenwasnotdisqualifiedfromvoting,since\nhisfelonyconvictiondidnotinvolvemoralturpitude,andthataCertificateofEligibilitywas\nthus unnecessaryto enable his registration.\n24. The office of Defendant Hunter informed the Board that the office of the\nSecretaryof State hadadvised themnot toregister individualswithfelonyconvictionswho\nhad not obtained a Certificate of Eligibility, without regard to whether or not such felony\nconvictions involved moral turpitude.\n25. In a June 20, 2005 letter to Plaintiff Jones, the Board explained that after\nreviewing his “application for a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote, we have\ndetermined that you were convicted of possession of a controlled substance,” which is a\nfelony “that does not appear to this agency to involve moral turpitude.” The Board\ndetermined that, according to Amendment 579 of the Alabama Constitution, Mr. Jones'\n“convictiondoesnotdisqualify[him]fromvoting.” TheBoardthereforeconcludedthat“we\nareclosingourfileonyourapplication,as youdo notneedacertificate inordertobeeligible\n8\n\nto register.”\n26. In a June 30, 2005 letter to Plaintiff Jones, the office of Defendant Hunter\nstatedthathisVoterRegistrationFormcouldnot beprocessedbecause“apersonconvicted\nof a felonyoffense is barred from voting, unless there has been a reinstatement of voting\nrights.” The office of Defendant Hunter referred Plaintiff Jones to the Board to “get [his]\nvoting rights restored.”\n27. Theprecedingparagraphnotwithstanding,andbeforehisfilingthislawsuiton\nDecember19,2005,PlaintiffJonesreceived aVoterRegistrationCard. Thecardinstructed\nJonesastohispollingplacefor“allelections—exceptmunicipal.” ThecardJonesreceived\nwas a standard card issued by the Jefferson County Registrar to all voters. The “except\nmunicipal” designation did not limit Jones' right to vote but was instead intended to alert\nJones that his polling place for municipal elections was in a different location from that\nshown on the card.\n28. ActNo.78-584,codified atAla.Code§17-4-124, provides,inpertinentpart,\nthe following:\nAnypersontowhom[voter]registrationisdeniedshallhavethe\nrightofappeal,withoutgivingsecurityforcosts,within30days\nafter such denial, by filing a petition in the circuit court in the\ncountyinwhich heor sheseeks to register,alleging that he or\nshe is a citizen of the United States over the age of 18 years\nhavingthe qualifications as to residence prescribedby law and\nentitled to register to vote under the provisions of the\nConstitution of Alabama, as amended.

ThedocketfeeforacomplaintorpetitionintheCircuitCourtunderAla.Code\n§17-4-124issetby Ala.Code§12-19-71. PursuanttoAla.Code§12-19-70,moreover, the\ndocket fee set by Ala. Code § 12-19-71 “may be waived initially and taxed as costs at the\nconclusionof thecase if the courtfindsthat paymentof the fee willconstitutea substantial\nhardship.”\n30. According to the Fiscal Year 2004-2005 Annual Report (page 35) of the\nAlabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, there were 469“pardons w/ restoration of civil&\npolitical rights granted” and 1,233 \"voters [sic] rights restored.”\n31. Alabama statutes require that the Board receive applications for Certificates\nof Restoration of Voter Registration Rights and either issue the certificate or inform the\napplicant why the certificate cannot be issued. The Board conducts an investigation\nconcerningeachapplicationtodetermineif the applicantiseligible underthelawtoreceive\nthe certificate. If so, the certificate is issued. If the applicant is ineligible to receive the\ncertificate,a letterissent totheapplicantstating thereasons forthe Board’sdecision. Ifthe\napplicant's conviction is not one that disenfranchises the applicant from voting, a letter is\nissued to the applicant so stating.\n32. The Board has mailed approximately330 letters declining to restore rights.\n33. On March 29, 2006,the Secretary of State issued a letter toAlabama Voter\nRegistrars that included the following statement: “The felon voter registration case is\ncurrentlyinFederal Court;therefore, ourofficecannot comment on this issueother thanto\nsaywe continuetoawaitguidance fromthe Courts or theAttorneyGeneral'sOffice on this\nmatter before we give you anyfurther information or advice.”\n34. The Secretary of State submitted proposed voter registration forms to the\nAlabamaSupreme Courton March15,2006. Theproposedformscontainlanguagestating\nthatcitizensareeligible solongas theyhavenotbeenconvictedof a“disqualifying felony,”\nwhich is a new term replacing the broader language used in the earlier forms.\n35. In response to the Secretary of State's request, the Alabama Supreme Court\nissuedanorderon April19,2006,advisingthattheSecretaryofState (ratherthanthe Court)\nhas the authority to proscribe the form and contents of applications for voter registration\npursuant to more recent legislation that supersedes Ala. Code §17-4-122.\n10\n\nB. Additional, Undisputed Evidence Received at the April 28 Hearing\nIn addition to the parties’ stipulations, the Court received sworn and undisputed\ntestimonyfrom two witnesses at the April 28 hearing.\nTheplaintiffs first called Tonya Colvin, who is the administrative assistant for the\nJefferson CountyBoard of Registrars. Ms. Colvin testified about the current practice used\nto decide who should be purged from the Jefferson County voter rolls.3 She receives a\nmonthlylistofallconvictionsfromtheJeffersonCountyCircuitCourt.4 Sheidentifiesthose\non the list who are currently registered to vote in Jefferson County and highlights their\nnames. SheinitiallyreferredthelisttotheDistrictAttorney’soffice,butnowsendsittothe\nofficeof theCountyAttorneyforJeffersonCounty. AccordingtoMs.Colvin,theassistant\ncountyattorney would identify who on the list was convicted of a felony involving moral\nturpitude. Ms. Colvin thereafter purges those individuals from the voter rolls.\nThe second witness was Theo Lawson, an assistant county attorney for Jefferson\nCounty. Mr. Lawson testified that he has recently assumed the task of reviewing the list\nreceived from Ms. Colvin and determining which of those voters on the list have been\nconvictedof crimesinvolvingmoralturpitude. Totheextenthecan,hereliesonpublished\nappellatedecisions thatexplicitly determine whether a particularcrime is of thatnature. If\nthe crime at issue does not fall within that category – and most do not – Mr. Lawson then\nreviewsthe elements of thecrime atissue,comparing themto theelements of thosecrimes\nthathavebeen determinedtoinvolvemoralturpitude. Mr. Lawsondetermineswhether,by\nanalogy, the felon should be disqualified from voting.\nHaving the opportunity to personally observe these witnesses as they testified, the\nCourthas no doubt about their sincerity. The Court also does not question their good faith\nandtheir earnestdesire todothe rightthingunder thelawas theyknow it. BothMs.Colvin\nandMr.Lawsonare conscientious and dedicated publicservants. In making hisdecisions,\nmoreover,Mr.Lawsondrawsupon considerableexperience,havingserved foranumber of\nyearsasanassistant districtattorneyandwithnumerouscriminalconvictionsunderhisbelt.\n3\nTheremovalofdisqualifiedindividualsfromvoterlistsispursuanttoAla.Code§17-4-132(although\nthatsectionstillreferstotheformerSection182oftheAlabamaConstitution,whichwasrepealedbyAmendment\n579).\n4\nMs.Colvinfurthertestifiedthatshereceivesasimilarlistfromthefederaldistrictcourteverymonthor\ntwo,andthatatleasteveryyear,shereceiveslistsofJeffersonCountyresidentswhohavebeenconvictedoffelonies\ninothercountiesinAlabama.\n11\n\nThereisno evidencebefore the Courtaddressing howany other countyinthis State\nis addressing this issue.\nC. Undisputed Evidence Received after the April 28 Hearing\nAdded in the Fourth Amended Complaintwas plaintiff AngelaThomas. In support\nof the plaintiffs’summary judgment motion, plaintiff Thomas filed anaffidavit,which has\nnotbeendisputed.

Thelistspans329pagesandidentifiesthousands\nof individuals.\nIII. Legal Analysis\nA. Issues Raised bythe Defendants’ Pending Motions.\nThisCourtwouldordinarilybeginwithaRule23analysissinceclassallegationshave\nbeen raised. In thiscase, however, there are someother issues thatare properlyaddressed\nbefore turning to that of class certification.\n(1). Defendants’ motion to dismiss under Ala. Code § 17-4-124\nPendingisdefendantWorley’smotiontodismissunderRule12(b)(6). Inthismotion,\nWorley argues that Count Three of the First Amended Complaint constitutes an appeal of\ndefendants’ refusal to register the named plaintiffs, brought under Ala. Code § 17-4-124.\n(CountsThreeandFouroftherecently-filedFourthAmendedComplaintreiteratethisclaim.)\nThatstatute expressly provides thatin anysuch appeal,“[t]he registrarsshall notbe\nmade parties. . . .” Instead, the statute provides for the State of Alabama to serve as the\nproper defendant. For that reason, this Court dismisses the claims brought under Counts\nThreeandFouroftheFourthAmendedComplainttotheextentthattheyare assertedagainst\ndefendantHunteror theputative defendantclass. TheCourtinsteadrecognizestheStateof\nAlabama as the proper defendant under these Counts, and the State’s pending motion to\n12\n\nintervene is therefore GRANTED. The Clerk of the Court is directed to add the State of\nAlabamaas anadditional defendantinthis action. No additionalservice need be perfected\nwiththissubstitution,giventhattheAlabamaAttorneyGeneral’sofficehasalreadyappeared\nonbehalfofdefendantWorley(theStateof AlabamaanddefendantWorleymaysometimes\nbe referred to hereafter as the “State defendants”).\n(2). State Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss\nBased the Sovereign Immunity Doctrine.\nIn both their motion to dismiss and their summary judgment motion, the State\ndefendantsraise thesovereign immunitydefense to argue that no claims inthis action may\nproperlylie against them.\nGuidancecomes fromPattersonv. Gladwin Corp.,835So.2d 137 (Ala.2002). The\nSupremeCourtthererecognizedthatthesovereignimmunitydoctrinebarsanyclaimseeking\nmonetaryreliefagainst the coffers of thisState. Id.at 142, quotingState DocksComm'n v.\nBarnes,225 Ala. 403, 405,143 So.581, 582(1932);see alsoAlabama Agr. &Mech.Univ.\nv.Jones,895So.2d867,873(Ala.2004)(“anactionisoneagainsttheStatewhenafavorable\nresultfortheplaintiffwoulddirectlyaffectacontract orpropertyrightoftheState,orwould\nresult in the plaintiff's recoveryof moneyfrom the State”)(citations omitted).\nThe Patterson court also recognized exceptions to the bar of sovereign immunity.\nActionsbrought to compel state officials to perform their legal duties, actions to preclude\nstate officials from enforcing unconstitutional laws, and declaratory judgment actions\nseeking the construction of a statute all fall outside the bar of the sovereign immunity\ndoctrine. Patterson, 835 So.2d at 142.\nThe Court agrees with the plaintiffs that the sovereign immunity doctrine is\ninapplicable here. The plaintiffs have asserted no claims for money damages. They are\ninsteadseekinganorderdirectingtheSecretaryof Statetoperformherlegalduties. Bylaw,\ntheSecretary of Stateis the chiefelectionsofficial and“shallprovide uniform guidancefor\nelection activities.” Ala. Code §17-1-8. Further, the Secretary of State “may promulgate\nrulesforthereceiptofapplicationsforvoterregistrationandthe expedientadministration of\nthose applications. . . .” Ala. Code § 17-4-136. Finally, and pursuant to the Alabama\nSupreme Court’s order of April 19, 2006, the Secretary of State now has the statutory\nauthorityto determine the form and contents of voter registration applications.\nTheevidencepresentedat the April28 hearing,moreover, confirmsthatinpractice,\nthe Secretary of State exerts considerable authority over the State’s voter registrars in an\n13\n\nefforttopromotea uniform administration of the State’s voting laws. Ms. Colvin testified\nabout a conference lastNovember at which Secretary of State Worley addressed this very\nissuebeforeanaudienceof personnelfromthe State’sregistraroffices. Atranscriptofthat\nmeeting, admitted into evidence, shows that Ms. Worley instructed those in attendance to\nmaintainthe status quo until clear guidance isreceived from the AttorneyGeneral’soffice\nor from the courts.\nAsthe State defendantspoint out,Ala. Code§ 17-4-136does provide thatany voter\nregistrationmustbe based on a board of registrars’ favorable determination of that voter’s\nqualifications. It is nonetheless clear from both the facts and the law that the Secretary of\nState plays an authoritative role in promulgating the general policies and procedures\nemployed bythe voting registrars of this State to decide voter qualifications.\nTheCourtalso agreesthatthe claimsseeking declaratoryjudgmentpertaining tothe\nclassmembers’ votingrights falloutsideofthe sovereignimmunitybar. Thedefendantsdo\nnot reallycontend to the contrary.\nThisCourt thus concludes that the State defendants’ pending motions are due to be\ndenied to the extent theyare based on the sovereign immunitydoctrine.\n(3). Mootness as to the Claims of the Named Plaintiffs.\nIntheir pendingmotions, thedefendants alsoraise amootness argument withregard\nto the named plaintiffs. This argument bears some scrutiny.\nAt the time this action was first filed, plaintiff Gooden had live claims against the\ndefendants. After the suit was filed, this Court entered an order on September 30, 2005,\ndirectingtheofficeof theJeffersonCountyregistrartopermithisregistrationpursuanttoan\nagreement of the parties. Compliance with that order has led to plaintiff Gooden’s\nregistration. Moreover,defendantStateofAlabamahasconfessedjudgmentwithregardto\nCount Three of theFirst Amended Complaint. In view of these developments, occurring\nafterthe filing of this action, the defendants now argue that plaintiff Gooden’s claims are\n14\n\nmoot and he maynot serve as the class representative.5\nWhileplaintiff Goodenis currently registeredin accordance withthis Court’s prior\norder,thatorderisconditionalinnature,subjecttorescissionoralterationatanytimebefore\na final judgment is entered. Indeed, that order expressly recognizes that “[t]his relief is\ninterimreliefonly, doesnotconstitute finalreliefinthecase, andshallbewithoutprejudice\ntoanyother claims made inthe complaint or anydefenses tothose claimsthat maybeduly\nraised.” Inahypotheticalsituation,acourtcouldlaterdeterminethatanorderrequiringthe\nregistrationof a felon was erroneous and subsequently direct the registrar to remove that\nindividual from the voting list. The Court thus does not regard its order of September 30,\n2005, as constituting the kind of final relief that could moot Gooden’s claims.\nNor maythe defendants seek to preclude adjudication on a classwide basis by the\nState’s confessing judgmenton a designatedrepresentative’s individual claim. In Jones v.\nSouthernUnitedLifeIns.Co.,392So.2d 822(Ala.1981),the namedplaintifffiled anaction\nseeking monetary relief for herself and certification of a class action. Before any\nclass-certificationdetermination, the defendanttendered paymentto plaintiff Jones of the\nmonetaryamountsshewasclaiming, whichsheaccepted. Thetrialcourtthereaftergranted\nthedefendant'ssummaryjudgment motionon theplaintiff’s individualclaimand dismissed\nthe remaining portions of the action.\nOnappeal,the Supreme CourtinJones identified the issue as“whether MaryJones,\nwhose claim is rendered moot through satisfaction, prior to certifying the class, may be\npermittedtohavetheclasscertified,and proceedtorepresentthatclass, eventhoughsheno\nlonger has a real interest in the right to be protected.” Id. at 823. The Court ultimately\nconcludedthat satisfactionof theplaintiff’sindividualclaimdidnot preventcertification of\nthe class. Further, “[n]otwithstanding the mootness of the suit as to Mary Jones, it is not\nmoot as to other members of the class, and she can continue to litigate the issues as a\nrepresentativeoftheclass.... [S]hewasnotoustedasarepresentativeoftheclasswhenher\nindividual claim was mooted bypayment of her claim. . . .” Id.\nJones v. Southern United Life Ins. Co. is clear authority for the proposition that a\nsettlement by a class representative of individual claims does not moot the claims of the\n5\nTheCourtregardsthismootnessargumentasdistinctfromtheanalysisusedtodecidewhetheraclassis\nproperlycertifiedunderRule23oftheAlabamaRulesofCivilProcedure. TheU.S.SupremeCourthasbefore\nrecognizedthattherelatedrequirementofstandingisaprerequisitetobeaddressedbeforeoneevenconsidersthe\nRule23factors. See,e.g.,Sosnav.Iowa,419U.S.393,402-03,95S.Ct.553,558-59(1975);Alleev.Medrano,\n416U.S.802,828-29,94S.Ct.2191,2206-07(1974).\n15\n\nclass. Its holding is not undercut by the later decision of Pharmacia Corp. v. Suggs, 932\nSo.2d95(Ala.2005),eventhoughtheSupremeCourtthereheldthatsettlementofthenamed\nplaintiffs’claims, beforecertification of the classas alleged in the complaint,divested the\ntrialcourtfromconsideringtheclassclaimsandmandateddismissaloftheentireaction. The\ndifferenceisthatinSuggs,theplaintiffsapparentlydeclinedtoserveasclassrepresentatives\noncetheir claims hadbeen settled,instead filinga motiontosubstitute new representatives\nintheir place. TheCourtexpresslydistinguishedJones,insteadof overruling it,statingthat\n“[i]nJones,theclassrepresentative soughtto remaininthe action andtoproceedon behalf\noftheotherclassmembers.Here,thenamedplaintiffsarecompletelyabandoningtheaction\nafterunequivocallyacceptinga settlementandthentryingtonamenewclassrepresentatives\nto take their place.” 932 So.2d at 99.\nTheJonesdecision, moreover,is inaccord withthe weightof authority tothe effect\nthatwhilea defendant’svoluntaryactions maymoot individualclaims, theclaims ofabsent\nclassmembersremainandthenamedplaintiffs,ifsodesiring, maycontinuetoserveasclass\nrepresentatives. See,e.g.,UnitedStates ParoleCommissionv. Geraghty,445U.S.388,100\nS.Ct. 1202 (1980);Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 95 S.Ct. 854 (1975).\nBecauseplaintiff Goodendesirestocontinue servingas a classrepresentative, Jones\nratherthanSuggs appearson point andpermits himtodo so. ThisCourtfurtherdetermines\nthatthe claimsof plaintiffThomas arenotmoot, giventhatshewasremovedfromJefferson\nCounty’s voter rolls for a felonyconviction and is currentlynot registered to vote.\nPlaintiff Jones stands in a different light, however. According to the parties’\nstipulated facts, described above, plaintiff Jones was registered to vote even before this\nactionwascommenced. Althoughtherehadbeensomequestionaboutwhetherhewouldbe\npermitted to register, that question was apparently resolved in his favor. At the time this\naction was filed, no live dispute existed between plaintiff Jones and anyofthe defendants.\nHis motion to intervene as an additional plaintiff is therefore denied, andhe maynot serve\nas a representative of the proposed plaintiff class.\nB. Class Certification Issues\nHavingresolvedthepreliminarymotions,theCourtnowturnstotheplaintiffs’request\ntocertifyplaintiff anddefendant classes. In considering this request, this Court is mindful\nof its obligations as defined bythe Supreme Court of Alabama:\nThe trial judge is directed to conduct such proceedings as he\ndeems necessary todetermine whether the proponents of class\n16\n\ncertification have met their burden of proving each of the four\nelements of Rule 23(a) and atleast one element of Rule 23(b).\nAnyfutureorderofthetrialcourtcertifyingaclassmustidentify\neach of the four elements of Rule 23(a), Ala. R. Civ. P., and\nmustprovide awritten rigorousanalysisof howthe proponents\nof class certification have met their burden of proving these\nelements. A certification order must also include a written\nrigorous analysis of how the proponents of class certification\nhavemettheirburden of provingoneof thoseelements of Rule\n23(b), Ala. R. Civ. P.\nEx parte Mayflower Nat. Life Ins. Co., 771 So.2d 459, 462 (Ala. 2000).\nIn the Fourth Amended Complaint, the proposed plaintiff class is defined as “[a]ll\nunregisteredpersonsotherwise eligibletovoteinAlabama whohavebeenconvictedof one\nor more felonies, but who have not been convicted of any felonies involving moral\nturpitude.” Given the nature of the injunctive and declaratory relief sought, which would\napplyto all individuals convicted of any felonies, the Court instead regards as appropriate\nthe following putative plaintiff class:\nEvery citizen of the United States, currently residing in this\nState and 18 years of age or older, who has at any time been\nconvictedofafelonyinanyjurisdictionandwhoisnot, asofthe\ndate of this order, registered to vote in this State.\nThe following analysis addresses whether this proposed plaintiff class may properly be\ncertified.\n(1). Rule 23(a)-- Requirement of Numerosity\nThefirstrequirementunder Rule23(a) isnumerosity. Morespecifically,there must\nbe substantial evidence that the class is “so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable.” Forpurposesof Rule23(a)(1), impracticabilitydoes notrequireashowing\nof impossibility, but instead relates to the difficulty or inconvenience in joining all class\nmembers. See Cheminova America Corp. v. Corker, 779 So.2d 1175, 1179 (Ala.\n2000)(quoting and approving trial court's certification order). Indeed, one noted\ncommentatorhasobservedthatRule23(a)(1)establishesnotarequirementofnumerosityso\nmuch as a requirement that joinder be impractical, which requirement is to be evaluated\nbasedon thecircumstancesof everyparticularcase. 1Conte&Newberg,NewbergonClass\nActions, § 3:3 (4thed. 2002); see also Cheminova, 779So.2d at1179, quoting, inter alia,\n17\n\nGeneral Tel. Co. of the Northwest, Inc. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 100 S.Ct. 1698 (1980).\nThisCourtdoesnothavespecificinformationregardingthe sizeof theputativeclass;\nhowever, “[w]here the exact size of the class is unknown but general knowledge and\ncommonsenseindicate thatitis large,the numerosityrequirementis satisfied.” 1Conte&\nNewberg, supra, at § 3:3;see also Bradley v. Harrelson, 151 F.R.D. 422, 426 (M.D. Ala.\n1993).\nThe evidence before this Court suggests that the class would be a huge one.\nDefendantHunter hasfiled withthe Court a379-page list of all convictedfelons whohave\nbeenremoved from Jefferson County’svoting rollssince 1996. Thousands of individuals\nappearon this list. Whilethere isnosimilar informationregardinganyof Alabama’s other\n66 counties, there is also no doubt that the members of the proposed class number in the\nthousands, if not tens of thousands, scattered throughout the State.\nWiththese considerationsinmind, the Courtconcludes thatthe requirementof Rule\n23(a)(1) has easilybeen met.\n(2). Rule 23(a) – Requirement of Commonality\nCommonality,the second requirementunder Rule23,requires theplaintiffstoshow\nthat there exist common issues of law or of fact. The Alabama Supreme Court has\nrecognized that a “common nucleus of operative facts is usually enough to satisfy the\ncommonalityrequirement of Rule 23(a)(2).” Cheminova, 779 So. 2d at 1180.\nInthe Fourth AmendedComplaint,the following issues are assertedto becommon:\n1. Whetherdefendant Worley instructedvoter registrars torefuse, and whether\nvoter registrars in fact refused, to register members of the plaintiff class to\nvote;\n2. Whetherthedefendants’actions violatedthe rightsguaranteedtothe plaintiff\nclass byAlabama’s constitution and laws;\n3. Whetherthedefendantsviolated therights guaranteedtotheplaintiff classby\nfederal laws; and\n4. Whether members of the plaintiff class are entitled to declaratory and\ninjunctive relief.\n18\n\nOn reflection, this Court concludes that the overriding legal issues common to all\nmembers of the putative plaintiff class can be summarized by asking two questions: first,\nhow should “moral turpitude,” as that term is found in Amendment 579 to the Alabama\nConstitution,bedefined; andsecond, whohasthe constitutional authoritytoestablish such\na definition? Because the answers to these questions will impact on the abilityof all class\nmembers to register to vote, the commonalityrequirement is easilysatisfied.\n(3). Rule 23(a) – Requirement of Typicality\nTypicality, the third requirement under Rule 23(a), “focuses on the interests of the\nclassrepresentatives.” Ex parteGovernmentEmployeesIns.Co.,729So.2d 299,304(Ala.\n1999);seealsoWarehouseHomeFurnishingDistrib.,Inc.v.Whitson,709So.2d1144,1149\n(Ala.1997)(“[t]ypicality exists whena plaintiff/class representative's injuryarises from or\nisdirectlyrelatedtoa wrongtoa classandthat wrongtothe classincludesthe wrongtothe\nplaintiff”).\nThecommonissuesinthis actionconfrontplaintiffsGoodenandThomasjustas they\nconfrontthe membersofthe classtheyseektorepresent. Whenhefiledthisaction,Gooden\nstood in the same position as the class members, and he shared claims with the class\nmembers that raise such common issues. Plaintiff Thomas still shares such claims. By\nbringingthisactiontopursuetheirownself-interest,plaintiffsGoodenandThomasare also\npursuingthe interests of the absent class members. If Gooden and Thomas have suffered\nlegalinjury, it wasas a result of a generally, if not universally, observedpolicy atthe time\nofrefusingtoregister anyconvictedfeloninthisState. Evenwithrecentdevelopmentsthat\nhave modified the practice of voter registration, the interests of the named plaintiffs in\nclarifyingandenforcing theircivilrights are identicaltothe interestsof the classmembers.\nFor these reasons, the typicalityrequirement of Rule 23(a) is satisfied.\n(4). Rule 23(a)–Requirement of Adequacy\nThe Alabama Supreme Court has explained the “adequacy-of-representation”\nrequirement of Rule 23(a) as follows:\nThe adequacy-of-representation requirement “is typically\nconstruedtoforeclose the classaction where there is a conflict\nof interestbetweenthe named plaintiff and themembers of the\nputativeclass.” GeneralTel.Co.v.EEOC,446U.S.at331,100\n19\n\nS. Ct. 1698. It also involves questions regarding whether the\nattorneysrepresentingtheclassare“qualified,experienced,and\ngenerally able to conduct the proposed litigation.” Griffin v.\nCarlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1533 (11th Cir.1985). Adequacy of\nrepresentation requires that the class representative “have\ncommoninterestswithunnamedmembersofthe class”andthat\ntherepresentative“willvigorouslyprosecutetheinterestsof the\nclassthroughqualifiedcounsel.” AmericanMed. Sys.,75 F.3d\nat1083 (quotingSenterv. GeneralMotorsCorp.,532F.2d511,\n525 (6th Cir.1976)); see also General Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457\nU.S. at 157, 102 S. Ct. 2364.\nCutler v. Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc., 770 So. 2d 67, 71 (Ala. 2000).\nNoconflictofinterestappears--plaintiffsGoodenandThomassharewithotherclass\nmemberstheinterestinhavingtheircivilrightsclarifiedsothattheymayknow whetherthey\ncanproperlyberegisteredtovote. Further,counselfortheplaintiffspossesstheneededskill\nandexpertisetovigorouslyprosecutetheinterestsof theproposedclass,asmade clearbythe\nhistoryoftheirlegalpracticedescribedinthe plaintiffs’SubmissionofAdditionalEvidence,\nfiled on May8, 2006.\nThe adequacyrequirement of Rule 23(a) has been met.\n(5). Rule 23(b)(2) -- the Appropriateness\nof Injunctive or Declaratory Relief\nInadditiontomeetingthe elements ofRule23(a),the plaintiffsmustmeetoneof the\nprongsofRule23(b)beforecertificationisproper. Theplaintiffsherebasetheirclassaction\nonRule 23(b)(2), which“was drafted specifically tofacilitaterelief incivilrightssuits.” 8\nConte & Newberg, supra, § 25:20. Especially since the plaintiff class would seek only\ndeclaratoryand injunctive relief, rather than money damages, this action is well-suited for\nclass treatment under Rule 23(b)(2).\n(6). Considerations Involving the Proposed Defendant Class\nThe plaintiffs seek certification of not onlya plaintiff class but a defendant class as\nwell. Defendant Hunter does not oppose certification of a defendant class of voting\nregistrars, but this Court must still undertake a “rigorous analysis” to decide whether\n20\n\ncertification is proper.\nThe propriety of certifying a defendant class in litigation similar to this one is\ndiscussed in 8 Conte & Newberg,supra, § 25:30:\nDefendant classes in criminal justice class action suits are an\nappropriatemeansofenhancingtheeffectivenessof ajudgment\nandfacilitatingtheadministrationofclassreliefwhenapractice\nisfoundtoviolatethe civilandconstitutionalrightsof aclassof\npersons. When the attorney for a class is confronted with a\npractice that has many administrative facets . . . a defendant\nclass may be necessary to ensure the cooperation of all\nresponsibleofficialsintheimplementationofaplantoeliminate\nthe practice. Likewise, in a situation which manyautonomous\nbodies such as courts or municipalities are engaged in\nadministering a statutory scheme violative of constitutionally\nprotectedrights,a defendantclassmaybeuseful,depending on\nthe degree of coordination and cohesiveness of the agencies\ninvolved.\nOne example of a case involving plaintiff and defendant classes is Richardson v.\nRamirez, 418 U.S. 24, 94 S.Ct. 2655 (1974), as described by the syllabus found at the\nbeginning of the Supreme Court’s decision:\nAfterthethree individualrespondents,whohadbeenconvicted\noffeloniesandhadcompleted theirsentencesandparoles,were\nrefusedregistrationtovoteinthreedifferentCaliforniacounties\nrespectivelybecauseof their felonyconvictions, theybroughta\nclass petition, on behalf of themselves and all other ex-felons\nsimilarly situated, for a writ of mandate in the California\nSupremeCourt,namingasdefendantstheSecretaryofStateand\nthe three county election officials who had denied them\nregistration“individuallyand as representatives of theclass of\nallother” countyelectionofficials inthe State,and challenging\nthe constitutionalityof respondents' disenfranchisement on the\nground,interalia,thatprovisionsoftheCaliforniaConstitution\nand the implementing statutes that disenfranchised ex-felons\ndenied them equal protection.\n418 U.S. at 24, 94 S.Ct. at 2656; see also Callahan v. Wallace, 466 F.2d 59 (5th Cir.\n21\n\n1972)(involvingplaintiff classagainst defendantclasstoendpracticeofadjudicatingtraffic\nviolationsbefore magistrates who havea financialinterest inthe outcomeby recovering a\nportionoffinesascompensation);McKayv.CountyElectionCom'rsforPulaskiCounty,158\nF.R.D. 620 (E.D. Ark.1994)(in a suit against county election commissioners in Arkansas\nallegingviolationsofstateand federalstatutes concerningaccessibilitytopollingplacesfor\ndisabledvoters, the district court concluded that both plaintiff and defendant classes were\nproperlycertified).\nThoughtful analysis of the issues raised by certifying a defendant class is found in\nRedhailv. Zablocki, 418F.Supp. 1061 (D.C.Wis. 1976),aff’d, 434 U. S.374, 98 S.Ct. 673\n(1978). AplaintiffclassinthatactionchallengedtheconstitutionalityofaWisconsinstatute\nthatrequiredcertainresidentstoobtaincourtpermissionbeforetheycouldmarry. Therelief\nsought included a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional and an\ninjunctionrestrainingitsenforcement. Havingdeterminedbypriororderthataplaintiffclass\nwasproper,thecourt turnedtowhether the claimscould bemaintained against adefendant\nclass:\nPlaintiffsseektohavethisactionmaintainedasaclassactionas\ntodefendants underRule23(b)(2)of the Federal Rulesof Civil\nProcedure. The defendant class is defined in the complaint as\n“allcountyclerks ofcounties withintheState of Wisconsin, all\nofwhomarerequiredby§245.10(1)Wis.Stats.(1971)torefuse\ntoissue marriage licensestomembers of the class of plaintiffs\nwithout a court order.” . . .\nRule 23(a) prescribes the essential prerequisites that must be\nsatisfiedforanyclassaction. Theyaresatisfiedhere. First,the\nclassof defendants,consistingofthe seventy-twocountyclerks\nin Wisconsin, is “so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable.”Rule 23(a)(1). Next, there is a question of law\ncommontoall the membersof the classthe constitutionalityof\nthe challengedstatute. Thirdly, the claims and defenses of the\nrepresentative party, defendant Zablocki, are “typical of the\nclaimsordefenses ofthe class,”Rule23(a)(3),sinceZablocki's\ncontention that his action in refusing a marriage license to\nRedhail was justified by the statute would undoubtedly be\nassertedbythe othercountyclerks.Finally, defendantZablocki\nisarepresentative partywho“willfairlyandadequatelyprotect\ntheinterestsof the class,”Rule23(a)(4). Notonlyisdefendant\nZablocki's interest identical to that of the other county clerks,\n22\n\nbuttheattorneyrepresentinghimisfromtheMilwaukeeCounty\nCorporationCounsel'sofficewhichisexperiencedinconducting\nfederal litigation. Furthermore, the Attorney General of\nWisconsinhastakenanactivepartinthisaction,urging thatthe\nchallenged statute be upheld.\nId. at 1065-66. The Redhail court then proceeded to analyze the circumstances under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2):\nARule 23(b)(2) class action is particularly appropriateincivil\nrights cases, although the rule is not so limited. 3B Moore's\nFederal Practice ¶ 23.40, at 23-651 23-654 (2d ed. 1974); C.\nWright, Law of Federal Courts, § 72, at 312 (2d ed. 1970);\nAdvisoryCommittee'sNoteto1966Amendment,39F.R.D.102\n(1966). WhilethelanguageofRule23(b)(2)doesnotexpressly\nprovide for its use where declaratory or injunctive relief is\nsought against a class, such class actions have been ordered.\nDanforthv.Christian,351F.Supp.287(W.D.Mo.1972);Rakes\nv.

See, 3B Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 23.40, 1974\nSupplement, at 86. Where, as here, a statute with statewide\napplication is challenged on the ground of its\nunconstitutionality, allowing the action to proceed against the\nclassof officialschargedwithits enforcementis inaccordance\nwith the interests of judicial administration and justice which\nRule 23 is meant to further.\nId.at 1066.\nThisCourtrecognizesthattheadequacy-of-representationrequirementofRule23(a)\nisdesignedtoguaranteedueprocess formembersofthe class,whoare absentfromthecourt\nbut whose interests are atissue. The adequacy-of-representation requirement is especially\nimportantindefendantclass actions becauseof the potentialliabilityof all members of the\nclass. Here,however,themembers of thedefendantclassdonotfaceanypersonalliability\nbecause the plaintiffsseek onlya declaration of legal rights and injunctive relief to protect\nthose rights.\nDefendantHunter is representedby experienced, capablecounsel fromthe office of\n23\n\nthe county attorney for Jefferson County. Further, counsel from the Alabama Attorney\nGeneral’soffice,representingthe Statedefendants, havebeen diligentindefending against\ntheplaintiffs’claimshere. ThereisnoindicationthatdefendantHunterhasinterestscontrary\nto those of absent class members orthatshe wouldbe lessthan diligent in defending those\ninterests. Thereisnotevenasuggestionthattheplaintiffshaveselectedaweakorill-suited\nrepresentative to stand for the interests of the defendant class.\nTheCourthere findsthat the requirements of Rule23,as it pertainstothe proposed\ndefendantclass,are met. Withregardtonumerosity,itappearsthattheproposeddefendant\nclasswouldcompriseapproximately200 individuals,workingineverycountyof theState.6\nThe common issues identified earlier would apply equally to how every member of the\ndefendantclassperformshisor her officialduties. DefendantHunter’spositionappearsno\ndifferent from that of anyother voter registrar, and no conflict is evident.\nTherequirements of Rule 23 have been met withregard to the proposed defendant\nclass, which maybe properlycertified.\nC. The Merits of this Action\n(1). Introductory Analysis\nHaving addressed class certification, the Court now turns to the merits of this\nlitigation. Withcrossmotionsforsummaryjudgmentpending,theparties’stipulationsand\ntheotherevidencebeforetheCourtdemonstratethatno disputeof materialfactexistsinthis\nmatter. Having reviewed the parties’ filings and having considered the evidence carefully,\nthis Court concludes that it mayproceed to a final adjudication of this dispute.\nThestarting point is Amendment 579 to the Alabama Constitution.

Separation of Powers Concerns\nRather than trying to answer the question of what is moral turpitude, this Court\nperceives that the proper starting point is to determine who has the authority to define “a\nfelonyinvolving moralturpitude.” AttheApril28hearing,theStatedefendantsarguedfor\na process by which the voting registrars would assume the role of gatekeeper to decide\nwhether a felon may properly register to vote. A citizen disappointed with a registrar’s\ndeterminationcouldthenfileanappealtothecircuitcourtunderAla.Code§17-4-124;inthat\nsituation, a circuit judge would then decide whether the crime involved moral turpitude.9\nSecretary of State Worley understandably has taken the position that she lacks the\nauthorityto determine which crimes involve moral turpitude. As evidenced byExhibit 11\nto the Stipulation of Undisputed Facts, the Secretary of State sought guidance from the\nAlabamaAttorneyGeneral’s officein2005, including a request for a list specifying which\nfelonies involve moral turpitude.\nDefendantHunter doesnotcontendthatherofficehastheabilitytocategorizewhich\ncrimes involvemoralturpitude, as confirmedby the testimonyof Ms. Colvin and Attorney\nLawsonthat thecountyattorneyforJeffersonCountyiscurrentlybeing askedtomake such\ndeterminations.\n8\nAttheApril28hearing,counselfortheStatedefendantsdiscussedthissituation:\nThewaythishasbeensetupinAlabama'slegislatureisthedecisioninitiallyrestswiththeBoard\nofRegistrarswhoare,withallduerespect,probablyveryunqualifiedgiventhattheironly\nqualificationisahighschooleducationtomakeadeterminationofamatteroflaw.\n(TranscriptofApril28,2006hearingatp.15).

SeealsoAmendment328totheAlabamaConstitutionof1901,§6.07\n(Bylocallaw,however,theprobatejudgesinJeffersonandMobilecountiesarerequiredtoholdlawlicenses).\n26\n\nIn its March 18, 2005 letter to the executive director of the Board of Pardons and\nParoles, the Office of the Attorney General acknowledged that it “cannot provide an\nexhaustivelist of every felonyinvolving moralturpitude. .. .” (Stipulation of Undisputed\nFacts,Ex.9). Theletterdidrecognizepriorcourtdecisionsinwhichparticularcrimeshave\nbeendeemedtoinvolvemoralturpitude. Accordingtotheletter,thereareapproximately15\nfeloniesthathavebeendeclaredtoinvolvemoralturpitude,includingmurder,rape,burglary,\ntheft,and bigamy. TheAttorneyGeneral’sletteralsospecifiesahandfuloffeloniesthatdo\nnot involvemoral turpitude,such as assault,aiding a prisonertoescape, simple possession\nof marijuana and felony driving under the influence. It does not identify any decisions\naddressing how federal crimes or felonies from other jurisdictions are to be regarded.\nFromthese facts, the defendantsapparentlyperceive the State’scourts as the proper\nauthorityto decide which crimes involve moralturpitude, notwithstanding the reliance on\npost hoc, subjective determinations to answer the question. If the defendants are correct,\nthen--given thatthis isa classactionof all felons whoare notregisteredtovote,and given\nthedeclaratoryand injunctivereliefthat theclassis seeking-- thisCourt couldconceivably\naddress the situation by promulgating anauthoritative, exhaustivelist of crimes involving\nmoral turpitude. For the reasons that follow, this Court maynot do so.\nThisconclusionresultsfromthepremisethatdisenfranchisementisacriminalpenalty.\nThe reality of the situation suggests that a deprivation of a right otherwise afforded to\ncitizens of this State, solely and directly as a result of a criminal conviction, can onlybe a\npenaltyfor that conviction. This premise is not without challenge, however, as some have\ncontendedthatsuch disenfranchisement statutesare non-penal innature, instead servingas\na means of civil regulation of the voting process.\nAprecedent for that stance is Tropv. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86,78 S.Ct. 590 (1958). In\ndicta found in a plurality opinion, Chief Justice Warren described disenfranchisement\nstatutesas anexample of “a nonpenalexerciseof the powertoregulate the franchise.” 356\nU.S.at97,78 S.Ct. at596. His view was that “a statute has been considered nonpenal if it\nimposesa disability,not to punish, but to accomplish some other legitimate governmental\npurpose.” 356 U.S. at 96, 78 S.Ct. at 595-96.\nTheidea thatdisenfranchisement is a methodof regulating the franchise ratherthan\npunishing convicted criminals has been criticized by several commentators, however, as\nexemplifiedbythefollowinganalysisinShapiro,ChallengingCriminalDisenfranchisement\nUnder the Voting Rights Act: A New Strategy, 103 Yale L. J. 537, 561 (1993).\nDisenfranchisementismostoftendefined asoneof anumberof\nnonpunitive civil disabilities that accompany a criminal\n27\n\nconviction. Proponents of this view claim that criminal\ndisenfranchisementprotects\"thepurityoftheballotbox\"intwo\nways. First, it prevents offenders from voting retributively\nagainst the criminal justice officials who prosecuted and\nconvictedthem. However,theSupremeCourthasstatedthatit\nis unconstitutional for a state to fence out a class of voters\nbecauseofthe way theymightvote[citing Carringtonv. Rash,\n380U.S.89,94 (1965)]. Second, defendersof thenonpunitive\nview claim that offenders are more likely to commit election\ncrimes than are other citizens and that disenfranchisement of\noffenders is necessary, therefore, to safeguard the integrity of\nvoting. But courts have noted that states already have more\neffectivewaysofdeterringelectionfraud,includingpenalcodes\nagainst these offenses.\nSeealsoEwald,CivilDeath:TheIdeologicalParadoxof CriminalDisenfrnachisementLaw\ninthe UnitedStates,2002 Wis.L.Rev. 1045,1058-59(2002);Karlan, Ballotsand Bullets:\nthe Exceptional History of the Right toVote, 71 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1345, 1367-68 & n. 136\n(2003).\nSincetheTropdecision,moreover,theU.S.SupremeCourthaspaidconsiderablyless\ndeference to similar kinds of rationales for restricting registration in other contexts. See\nDunnv. Blumstein,405U.S.330, 92 S.Ct.995 (1972)(statelaws requiringwould-be voters\nto comply with residency requirements do not further any compelling state interest and\nviolatethe equalprotectionclause ofthe FourteenthAmendment,notwithstandinga“purity\noftheballotbox”rationale);Kramerv.UnionFreeSch.Dist.,395U.S.621,631-32,89S.ct.\n1886, 1892 (1969)(despite a purported state interest in limiting school district elections to\ninterestedpartieswhoare directlyaffected,alaw restrictingthe righttovoteinlocalschool\nboard elections was not narrowlytailored to serve that interest).\nThe “purity of the ballot box” view appears to have been first articulated in\nWashington v. State, 75 Ala. 582 (1884), where the Alabama Supreme Court held that\ndisenfranchising thoseconvicted of certain felonies, in accordance with a provision of the\nAlabamaConstitutionof 1875,wasnota penaltysoas toimplicatethefederalconstitution's\nprohibitionof ex post facto laws. The rationale for the decision was the court's conclusion\nthat voting was a privilege rather than a right. This concept of voting was subsequently\nestablished by the Alabama Constitution of 1901, at Article I, Section 33. The\nconstitutionalityof this provision,whilenever beforeconsidered,iscalled intodoubt given\nthemotivationssurrounding manyof theprovisionsof the1901 Constitution. Seegenerally\n28\n\nUnderwoodv. Hunter,730 F.2d614 (11thCir. 1984).10 In anyevent, this interpretation of\nvotingcan no longerbe good law in light of sub-paragraph (a) of Amendment 579, which\nprovides the right to vote to all adult citizens residing in this State. See also Reynolds v.\nSims,377U.S.at562,84S.Ct.at1381(“sincethe righttoexercisethefranchiseinafreeand\nunimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged\ninfringementoftherightof citizenstovotemustbecarefullyandmeticulouslyscrutinized”).\nInshort, this Courtregardsthe whole “purityof the ballot box” rationale as nothing\nmore than a contrived rationalization to cover up efforts to prevent black citizens from\nvoting,as polltaxes and literacytestsonce did. It thus maynot be regarded as a legitimate\nbasisfordisenfranchising convictedfelons. ThisCourtalsorejectsanyargumentthatsuch\ndisenfranchisement would prevent voter fraud, agreeing with the commentary that the\n“[p]reviouscommissionofafelonydoesnotlogicallyleadtofuturecommissionofelectoral\nfraud, nor does previous non-commission of a felony rule out the possibility of future\nelectoralfraud;one hasno bearing on the other.” Note,Voting– NotQuite a Fundamental\nRight?A LookatLegal and LegislativeChallenges toFelon DisenfranchisementLaws, 89\nMinn. L. Rev. 231, 261 (2004). No rational or legitimate state interest is served by\ndisenfranchisingconvictedfelonsother thanasa formof punishmentforthe commissionof\ncertain crimes.\nObserving Richardson v. Ramirez, 418U.S. 24,94 S.Ct. 2655, this Court does not\ntakeissuewithapenalviewofadisenfranchisement lawsuchasthatfoundinsub-paragraph\n(b) of Amendment 579. That being so, however, this Court must hold that it lacks the\nconstitutional authority to decide which crimes involve moral turpitude. Because\ndisenfranchisementisacriminalpenalty,flowingdirectlyandsolelyfromaconviction,only\nthe Alabama Legislature maydetermine the crimes to which this penaltyattaches.\nSection43oftheAlabama Constitutionof1901 establishestheseparation-of-powers\ndoctrine in our state government:\nIn the government of this state, except in the instances in this\nConstitution hereinafter expressly directed or permitted, the\nlegislative department shall never exercise the executive and\njudicial powers, or either of them; the executive shall never\n10\nThepresidentofthe1901Alabamaconstitutionalconventiondeclaredtohisfellowdelegates:“And\nwhatisitthatwewanttodo?WhyitiswithinthelimitsimposedbytheFederalConstitution,toestablishwhite\nsupremacyinthisState.” OFFICIALPROCEEDINGSOFTHECONSTITUTIONALCONVENTIONOFTHE\nSTATEOFALABAMA,MAY21ST,1901,TOSEPTEMBER3RD,1901,vol.1,atp.8(1901)(statementofJohn\nB.Knox).\n29\n\nexercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them;\nthe judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive\npowers,or eitherof them;totheendthatitmaybeagovernment\nof laws and not of men.\nTheAlabamaSupreme Courtrecentlyrecognizedthatthecourtsmustnotonlyexercisecare\ntoavoidusurpingthefunctionsoftheotherbranchesofgovernmentbutalsoassumeprimary\nresponsibility for protecting the autonomy of each branch.

The U.S. Supreme Court, for\nexample,hasbeforerecognizedthat“definingcrimesandfixingpenaltiesarelegislative,not\njudicial,functions.” UnitedStatesv.Evans,333U.S.483,486-87, 68S.Ct.634,636(1948);\nseealsoWisconsinv.Mitchell,508U.S.476,486,113S.Ct.2194,2200(1993)(“theprimary\nresponsibility for fixing criminal penalties lies with the legislature”), citing Rummel v.\nEstelle,445 U.S. 263, 274, 100S.

Ct. 1280, 1284 (1958).\nThisviewhasbeencodifiedatAla.Code§13A-1-4,whichprovides that“[n]oactor\nomission is a crime unless made so by this title or by other applicable statute or lawful\nordinance.” Further,whileunderAla.Code §13A-5-2(e),a courtmayexerciseitsauthority\nto“forfeitproperty, dissolvea corporation, suspend or cancelalicense or permit, remove a\npersonfromoffice,citeforcontemptor imposeanyotherlawfulcivilpenalty”by including\nanordertosuch effect asapartof aconvicteddefendant’s sentence,the commentarytothat\nstatuteemphasizes that“[s]uchpenaltycouldbepartof the judgmentonlywherethe statute\nthat authorizes the penalty permits the procedure.” It is the Legislature’s prerogative to\ndeterminethepenaltiesforeverycrime. ThisCourtwouldusurpthatconstitutionalauthority\nifitweretocatalogue thosecrimesforwhichdisenfranchisement mayproperly beimposed.\nOur Supreme Court has made clear that such judicial activism has no place in our\njudicial system. The “equity funding cases” exemplifythe kind of judicial restraint that is\ninstead mandated here. InEx parte James, 713 So. 2d 869(Ala. 1997), a pluralityopined\nthatwhilethe judiciaryheldanabstractauthoritytoremedyunconstitutional deficienciesin\nAlabama’s schools, it would not attempt this task, instead recognizing that “the legislature\n. . . bears the primary responsibility for devising a constitutionally valid public school\n30\n\nsystem.” Id. at882 (quotationsomitted). Accordingly,the opinionvacated the trialcourt's\nremedialplanandoriginallydirected the AlabamaLegislature toformulatea constitutional\neducationsystem. Id.at882. Thatorderwaslatervacated,andultimatelyinExparteJames,\n836So. 2d813(Ala.2002),a pluralityoftheCourtfoundthattheissuespertainingtoschool\nfinancing were non-justiciable, therebyprecluding continued court oversight:\nContinuing the descent from the abstract to the concrete, we\nnowrecognizethatanyspecificremedythat thejudiciarycould\nimpose would, in order to be effective, necessarily involve a\nusurpation of that power entrusted exclusively to the\nLegislature. Accordingly, compelled by the authorities\ndiscussed above -- primarily by our duty under § 43 of the\nAlabama Constitution of 1901 -- we complete our judicially\nprudent retreat from this province of the legislative branch in\norder that we may remain obedient to the command of the\npeople of the State of Alabama that we “never exercise the\nlegislativeand executive powers, or either of them; to the end\nthat it may be a government of laws and not of men.” Ala.\nConst.1901, § 43 (emphasis added).\nId.at 819. Any remedy that this Court might fashion – in the exercise of deciding which\ncrimes involve moral turpitude – would similarly “involve a usurpation of that power\nentrusted exclusivelyto the Legislature.”\nAlthoughAlabama’sappellate courtshavebeforeaddressedcasesthatraisethe issue\nofwhichcrimesinvolvemoralturpitude,areviewof thesecases–asidentifiedinthe exhibit\nto the plaintiffs’ Submission of Additional Evidence– reveals that innone did a partyraise\naseparation-of-powersargumentinanefforttoprecludesuchajudicialdetermination. With\nthisissue as the foremostconcern here,however, this Court declines to engage in the kind\nofjudicialactivismrequiredtocomprehensivelyanswerthequestionposedinthiscase. This\nCourt must instead defer to the other branches of our state government to enact whatever\nlegislationtheydeemproper toeffectuate themandate of sub-paragraph(b)of Amendment\n579 to the Alabama Constitution.\nThis conclusion is supported byexplicit provisions of Amendment 579 recognizing\ntheLegislature’s suzeraintytoimplement itsterms. Again quoting fromsub-paragraph (a)\nthereof,“[t]heLegislaturemayprescribereasonableandnondiscriminatoryrequirementsas\nprerequisites to registration for voting” (emphasis added). That constitutional grant of\nauthorityis preciselywhat is at issue here.\n31\n\nJustas this Courtlacks the powertodesignate crimes forwhich disenfranchisement\nmayproperly be imposed as a punishment, so too are the Secretary of State, the Attorney\nGeneral, county boards of registrars and county attorneys precluded from making such\ndeterminations–foranysuchgovernmentalofficialor agencytodosowouldusurp therole\nofour Legislaturetodeclare,by duly-enactedlegislation, whenthis punishmentis properly\nimposed.\n(3). Due Process Issues\nEven were the separation-of-powers doctrine of no concern, the current situation\nraisesasecond constitutionalinfirmity. Theimpossibilityofdefining--withanyreasonable\nprecision--theterm “moralturpitude,”asfoundinAmendment579,givesrisetosignificant\ndue process concerns.\nAt the time Amendment 579 was enacted, Alabama’s appellate courts had made\nseveraleffortstodefinethisterm. Forexample,inExparteMcIntosh,443So.2d1283,1284\n(Ala. 1983), the Supreme Court relied on the following definition found in C. Gamble,\nMcElroy's Alabama Evidence, § 145.01(7) (3d ed. 1977):\nThe Supreme Court of Alabama has defined the term “moral\nturpitude” on many occasions and the following are the most\ncommonly found definitions. Moral turpitude signifies an\ninherent quality of baseness, vileness and depravity. It is\nimmoral in itself, regardless of the fact that it is punished by\nlaw. Therefore, an offense for conviction of which a witness'\ncredibility is lessened must be mala in se and not mala\nprohibitum.\nSimilarly, in Williams v. State, 55 Ala. App. 436, 437, 316 So. 2d 362, 363 (Ala.\nCrim. App. 1975), the Court of Criminal Appeals relied on a summary of the meaning of\nmoral turpitude found in McElroy,Law of Evidence in Alabama, Vol. I, § 145.01(7):\n“Moral turpitude signifies an inherent quality of baseness,\nvileness,depravity.” Gillmanv. State,165Ala.135,51So.722.\nMoralturpitude‘impliessomethingimmoralitself,regardlessof\nthe fact whether it is punishable by law. The doing of the act,\nand not its prohibition by statute fixes the moral turpitude.’\nPippinv. State,197Ala613,73 So.340.Moralturpitude means\n‘something immoral in itself. * * *It must not be merelyMala\n32\n\nprohibita, but the act itself must be inherently immoral.

This Court\nagreeswiththe conclusionof onecommentator that“‘moralturpitude’ isan elusive, vague\nandtroublesomeconceptinthelaw,incapableof precisedefinition;suchisevidencedbythe\nmyriad of definitions and interpretations in judicial opinions.” Wilson, The Definitional\nProblems with “Moral Turpitude,” 16 J. Legal Prof. 261 (1991).11\nNor is this problema recent one. Back in 1979, a member of the Morgan County\nBoardofRegistrarsrequestedanattorneygeneral’sopinion,framingherrequestasfollows:\nIwouldlike to request an opinion from youroffice concerning\nthe disenfranchisement of voters for the conviction of certain\noffenses. I am especially interested in those crimes involving\nmoral turpitude.\nThedisqualifyingoffensesarelistedinArticle 8,Section182of\nthe 1901 Constitution [now repealed and replaced bythe new\nSection177]. I feel certainthatsome of these offenses mayno\nlonger be disqualifying due to recent federal or state court\njudgments. I am in hopes that your office might provide me\nwith some form of an updated list.\nIt has always been difficult and confusing to determine those\ncrimes involving moral turpitude which might keep someone\nfrom voting.

The attorneygeneral’s response was\nalongthelinesof thatrecentlyprovidedtotheexecutivedirectoroftheBoardofPardonsand\nParoles, discussed in the parties’ stipulations of fact, supra, in that it failed to provide a\nworkable definition and instead resorted to listing those reported appellate decisions that\nhave identified certain crimes one wayor the other.\nUnderthe currentprocess,thoseattempting tointerpretand applysub-paragraph(b)\nof Amendment 579 must make post hoc decisions, using subjective assessments of what\nfeloniesare particularlyimmoral soas tofall inthe categoryof moralturpitude. ThisCourt\nhasno doubt that when assistant county attorney Theo Lawson attempts to undertake that\ntask,for example,he does so withskill, diligence, and a conscientious desire to do his job\ncorrectly. His decisions, however, may differ from those of an equally skilled and\nconscientiousofficialundertaking thesametask elsewhere. Acrimethatonemayregardas\ninvolving moralturpitude,the other mayregardas not. The problem is, if anything, made\nworse if the decision-makers are voter registrars who lack the familiarity that attorney\nLawson possesses with our criminal justice system. Nor can a court review any such\ndecisionwithoutusingitsownsubjectiveassessment,armedwithonlythelanguagefromthe\nabove-quoted cases that shine precious little light on the matter.\nAtthisjuncture,theEleventhCircuit’sobservationofthisprobleminthe Underwood\nv. Hunter decision bears repeating:\nThe attorney general in opinion has acknowledged that the\nclassificationofpresentlyunaddressedoffenses“willturn upon\nthe moral standards of the judges who decide the question.”\nPl.Exh. 3; see also infra note 13. “Thus does the serpent of\nuncertainty crawl into the Eden of trial administration.”\nMcCormick, McCormick on Evidence § 43, at 85-86 (2d ed.\n1972).\n730 F.2d at 616 n. 2.

In\nOklahoma, for example, a misdemeanor charge of simple possession of\nmarijuanais a crime of moralturpitude,atleast inthe context of disciplinary\nproceedings against an attorney.

AlabamaDepartment ofEnvironmentalManagement,\n437 So. 2d 82 (Ala. 1983), the Supreme Court recognized that every citizen of Alabama\nenjoys the right to due process as guaranteed under the Alabama Constitution of 1901,\nArticle 1, Sections 6 and 13. This right applies in both civil actions and criminal\nproceedings. Id. at84,citing Pikev. Southern BellTelephone and TelegraphCo.,263 Ala.\n59, 81 So. 2d 254 (1955).\nDue process requires that a State provide meaningful standards to guide the\napplicationof its laws. See Kolender v. Lawson,461 U.S.352, 358, 103S.Ct. 1855, 1858\n(1983). “The touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary\nactionof government.” Daniels v.

City of MountainBrook, 844So. 2d 577\n(Ala. 2002), citing Ross Neely, 437 So. 2d at 85.\nIn Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S. 223, 71 S.

S.\nGovernmentof taxesondistilledspiritsinvolvedmoralturpitudesoastorequiredeportation\nof analienwho had been twice convicted and sentenced for such acrime. The majorityof\nthe Court rejected the petitioner’s argument that the statutoryphrase fell afoul of the void-\n36\n\nfor-vaguenessdoctrine. Thedissent–JusticeJacksonwritingforhimselfandJusticesBlack\nand Frankfurter – refuted the majority opinion in such compelling fashion that extended\nquotation thereof is helpful:\nWhatthe Governmentseeks,andwhattheCourtcannot give,is\na basic definition of “moral turpitude” to guide administrators\nand lower courts. (341 U. S. at 233, 71 S. Ct. at 709).\nCongressdidnotseefittostatewhatmeaningitattributestothe\nphrase “crimeinvolving moral turpitude.” It is not one which\nhas settled significance from being words of art in the\nprofession. If we go to the dictionaries, the last resort of the\nbaffled judge, we learn little except that the expression is\nredundant, for turpitude alone means moral wickedness or\ndepravity and moral turpitude seems to mean little more than\nmorallyimmoral. TheGovernment confesses that it is “a term\nthatisnotclearlydefined,”andsays:“The variousdefinitionsof\nmoral turpitude provide no exact test bywhich we can classify\nthe specific offenses hereinvolved.” (341 U. S. at 234-35, 71\nS.Ct. at 709-10).\nExcept for the Court's opinion, there appears to be universal\nrecognition that we have here an undefined and undefinable\nstandard. The parties agree that the phrase is ambiguous and\nhaveproposeda varietyof teststoreducethe abstractprovision\nof thisstatute to someconcrete meaning. (341 U. S.at 235,71\nS. Ct. at 710).\nRespondent suggests here, and the Government has on other\noccasions taken the position, that the traditional distinction\nbetweencrimes malaprohibitaandthose malainse willafford\na key forthe inclusions and exclusions of this statute. But we\ncannotoverlookthatwhatcrimes belonginwhichcategoryhas\nbeen the subject of controversy for years. This classification\ncomestous fromcommonlaw, whichinits earlyhistoryfreely\nblended religious conceptions of sin with legal conceptions of\ncrime. This statute seems to revert to that practice. (341 U. S.\nat 236-37, 71 S. Ct. at 710-11).\nTheGovernment, however, offers the mala prohibita, mala in\n37\n\nsedoctrinehereinslightlydifferentverbiagefordeterminingthe\nnature of these crimes. It says: “Essentially, they must be\nmeasured against the moral standards that prevail in\ncontemporary society to determine whether the violations are\ngenerallyconsideredessentiallyimmoral.” Canweaccept“the\nmoral standards that prevail in contemporary society” as a\nsufficientlydefinite standard forthe purposesof the Act? This\nisa largecountryand actsthatare regardedascriminalinsome\nstates are lawful in others. We suspect that moral standards\nwhichprevailas topossession or saleof liquor that hasevaded\ntax may not be uniform in all parts of the country, nor in all\nlevelsof “contemporarysociety.” Howshouldweascertainthe\nmoralsentimentsof masses of persons on anybetterbasis than\na guess? (341 U.S. at 237-38, 71 S. Ct. at 711).\nTherehave, however, been something likefifty cases in lower\ncourtswhich appliedthis phrase. No one can read this bodyof\nopinions and feel that its application represents a satisfying,\nrational process. If any consistent pattern of application or\nconsensusof meaningcould bedistilledfromjudicial decision,\nneitherthe Governmentnorthe Courtspellsitout. Irrationality\nis inherent in the task of translating the religious and ethical\nconnotationsofthe phraseintolegaldecisions. Thelowercourt\ncases seem to rest, as we feel this Court's decision does, upon\nthe moral reactions of particular judges to particular offenses.\nWhat is striking about the opinions in these ‘moral turpitude'\ncasesisthe wearisomerepetitionofcliches attemptingtodefine\n“moral turpitude,”. . . . But the guiding line seems to have no\nrelation to the result reached. The chief impression from the\ncases is the caprice of the judgments. How many aliens have\nbeen deported who would not have been had some other judge\nheard their cases, and vice versa, we mayonly guess. That is\nnotgovernment by law. (341 U.S.at 239-40, 71S.Ct.at 712).\nUniformityand equalprotectionofthe lawcan come onlyfrom\nastatutorydefinitionof fairlystableandconfinedbounds. (341\nU. S. at 242, 71 S.

Our jurisprudence was much different at the time of that case, however. The\n\"separate but equal\" doctrine of Plessey v. Ferguson was still good law, for example, and\nthere have been numerous decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court that have subsequently\nbroadened the parameters of due process rights.\nIn Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902 (1976), the U. S.\nSupreme Court recognized that “[d]ue process, unlike some legal rules, is not a technical\nconception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances,\" quoting\nCafeteriaWorkers v.McElroy,367U.S.886,895, 81S.Ct. 1743,1748 (1961). Ratherthan\na fixed notion, “due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the\nparticularsituationdemands.” Morrissey v.Brewer,408U.S.471,481,92 S.Ct.2593, 2600\n(1972).\nThisviewisexemplifiedbythedecisioninWilliamsv. Illinois,399U.S.235,90 S.Ct.\n2018(1970). In Williams,the U.S.Supreme Courtinvalidatedon equalprotectiongrounds\na venerable practice of extending prison terms beyond the statutory maximum when a\ndefendant was unable to paya fine or court costs, explaining as follows:\n[N]either the antiquity of a practice nor the fact of steadfast\nlegislative and judicial adherence to it through the centuries\ninsulates it from constitutional attack . . .\nTheneed tobe open to reassessment of ancientpractices other\nthanthoseexplicitlymandatedby theConstitutionis illustrated\nbythe present case since the greatlyincreased use of fines as a\ncriminal sanction has made nonpayment a major cause of\nincarceration in this country.\nId., at 239-240, 90 S.Ct. at 2021.\nBecause this analysis focuses on due process considerations under the Alabama\nConstitution, moreover, this Court has the leewayto recognize developments in the law of\ndueprocessinthe 55years sincethe Jordanv. DeGeorgedecision. Itisthereforeproperto\nrelyon the current state of the law in deciding the due process implications involved.\nMathewsdescribedatestinvolvingthree factorsfordeterminingwhetheraparticular\nprocedure is constitutionally adequate: (1) the private interest at stake; (2) the risk that\nexisting procedures will wrongly impair this private interest, and the likelihood that\nadditional procedural safeguards can effect a cure; and (3) the governmental interest in\n39\n\navoiding these additional procedures. Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335, 96 S. Ct. at 903.13\nThe private interest at stake is the right to vote, which – as was quoted at the\nbeginning of this order -- has been recognized in Reynolds v. Sims as “the essence of a\ndemocraticsociety.” TheU.S.SupremeCourtlatercharacterizedtherighttovoteas“acivil\nrightofthehighestorder.”Oregonv.Mitchell,400U.S.112,139,91S.Ct.260,272(1970).\nThisright implicatesothers, moreover. Under Ala. Code § 12-16-60, a citizenis qualified\ntoserveonajuryonlyif heor she“hasnotlosttherighttovotebyconvictionforanyoffense\ninvolving moralturpitude.” Several appellate courts have also recognized that the right to\nsiton a jury is one of our fundamental civilrights. See United States v. Maines, 20 F.3d\n1102, 1104 (10th Cir. 1994); United States v. Thomas, 991 F.2d 206, 214 (5th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 510 U.S. 1014, 114 S. Ct. 607(1993); UnitedStates v.

Following Justice Jackson’s dissent in Jordan v. De George,what is inplace\nnowputsanindividual’s righttovoteatthemercyofsubjectivediscretionthatisunguided\nbyanymeaningful standards. As an aspect of this second prong, moreover, it appears that\nthis problem is easily remedied along the lines of what the separation-of-powers doctrine\nmandates in anyevent– forthe Alabama Legislatureto enactlegislation specifying which\nfelonies are to be regarded as involving moral turpitude.\nThefinal Mathewsfactoraskswhether theState ofAlabama hasalegitimateinterest\nin preserving the status quo of a standardless, post hoc determination of which felonies\ndepriveacitizen ofthe righttovote. Thereappearsnolegitimateinterestinmaintainingthe\nstatusquo. Replacingthecurrentprocessbyoneinwhichduly-enactedlegislationidentifies\nthose crimes involving moral turpitude would appear to benefit all parties, plaintiffs and\ndefendants alike, bypromoting clarityand consistency.\nThisanalysis maybe seenas flying inthe face ofa numberof casesfromAlabama’s\nappellatecourtsthatpurporttodefinecrimesthateitherdoordonotinvolvemoralturpitude.\nHowcan this Courtbesoconcernedabout thematter whentheappellate courtsof this State\nhaveperiodically undertaken this task without such concern?

Thisparticularissuehasapparentlynot\nbeen presented to Alabama’s appellate courts for adjudication.\nIf possible, this Court must interpret Amendment 579 to be in harmony with\nfundamental due process rights provided byother provisions of the AlabamaConstitution.\nIftwoprovisionsof ourConstitutionare inconflict,and oneof them iscontained inArticle\nI (the Declaration of Rights), that provision must prevail. State ex rel. Galanos v. Mapco\nPetroleum, Inc., 519 So. 2d 1275, 1277 (Ala.1987), quoting In reDorsey, 7 Port. 293, 359\n(Ala.1838). There is no conflict between Amendment 579 and those due process rights\nestablished under Sections 6 and 13 of the Alabama Constitution, however, so long as\nAmendment 579 is applied in the proper manner.\nInentering this order,this Courtdoes not intendtodisparage the dedication or good\nfaith of the named defendants, or of the defendant class members, in any way. To the\ncontrary,thisorderiswiththeassumptionthatthedefendantsarededicated,well-intentioned\nservantsof thepublic.

Adjudicating the Plaintiffs’ Claims\nTheabove analysisof theseparation-of-powersanddueprocess problemsismadein\nthe context of adjudicating those claims based on Amendment 579 to the Alabama\nConstitutionand Ala. Code§17-3-9. Given the above conclusions, a judgment in favor of\nthe plaintiff class is due to be entered on Counts One and Two of the Fourth Amended\nComplaint, as well as on Count Six thereof, to the extent that that Count is based on the\nrightsoftheplaintiffclassunderAmendment579totheAlabamaConstitutionandAla.Code\n§17-3-9. In view of the constitutional infirmities addressed above, sub-paragraph (b) of\nAmendment 579 maynot be enforced until there is legislation effectuating its purpose and\nclarifyingitsscope. Absentsuchlegislation,therighttovoteprovidedbysub-paragraph(a)\nof Amendment 579 stands without qualification.14\nTheplaintiff class is therefore entitled to a declaration that the defendants maynot\n14\nThisCourtdoesnotaddresstheprohibitionpertainingtothe“mentallyincompetent”foundinsub-\nparagraph(b)ofAmendment579.\n41\n\nimpedetheirrightstoregisterandtoremainon thevotinglistssimplybecauseofpriorfelony\nconvictions.

Plaintiffs\nGoodenand Thomasmaynot prevailon theirindividualclaimsunderAla.Code§17-4-124.\nGooden’s claim is moot, and Thomas has waited too long to bring her claim under this\nstatute. The Court declines to address any class claims that may arise under this statute;\nindeed,itisdubiousthatadjudicationona classwidebasisis possiblegiven the30-day time\nbar of that statute.\nCount Fivealleges a violation of 42 U.S.C. §1971(a)(2)(B).

Allclaims\nunder this Count must therefore be dismissed.\nCountSixalsoraisesequalprotection/dueprocessclaimsunderbothstateandfederal\nconstitutionswith regard to voter registration forms. Employing the due process analysis\nhereinabove,this Courtconcludes thatthe plaintiff class is entitled toa judgment on these\nclaims based on the determination that the defendants’ actions in preventing them from\nregistering violate their due process rights under the Alabama Constitution. This Court\ndeclines to reach anyfederal claims.\nD. Attorneys’ Fees Petition\nTheplaintiffs have pending a motion for the award of attorneys’ fees, based on 42\nU.S.C.§1988. TheAlabamaSupremeCourthasrecently(andunanimously)heldthatArticle\nI, Section 14 of the Alabama Constitution of 1901 prohibits such an award against state\nofficials in their official capacity. See Ex parte Town ofLowndesboro, ____ So.2d ____,\n2006 WL 1304902 (Ala., May12, 2006). On the otherhand, as the Courtheld inJames v.\nAlabama Coalition for Equity, Inc., 713 So.2d 937 (Ala.1997), the doctrine of sovereign\nimmunitydoes notpreclude anawardof attorneys’fees under42 U.S.C.§§ 1983 and1988.\nThe plaintiffs here have alleged some claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983. This Court\neither rejected or did not reach the plaintiffs’ federal claims, however, instead basing its\nconclusionsonstatelawgrounds. ThefirstquestioniswhethertheLowndesbororuleapplies\nto foreclose anyaward.\nThereisasomewhatcuriouslineofcasesdealingwithwhetheranawardofattorneys’\nfeesmaybeordered evenif relief ison onlystatelaw claims, providedthoseclaims sharea\n42\n\nnucleusof factwithaccompanyingfederalclaims. InDavisv.Everett,443So.2d1232(Ala.\n1983), the plaintiff broughtan action against citycommissioners, alleging that their denial\nofherliquorlicenseapplicationviolatedherrightsunderbothstateandfederalconstitutions.\nThetrial court foundinher favoron the state lawclaim, and apparentlydid not address the\nfederalclaim brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The trial court also denied her request for\nattorneys’ fees. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed on the following basis:\nIt is not necessary here to equate equal protection under the\nConstitution of 1901, Art. I, §§ 1, 6, and 22, with equal\nprotectionundertheUnitedStatesConstitutionforallpurposes;\nhowever,theAlabamaConstitutionnecessarilyembracesatleast\nthe minimal requirements of the United States Constitution.\nDefendantsviolated plaintiff'sequalprotectionrights underthe\nAlabamaConstitution. Itmayalsofollowthatplaintiff'sfederal\nconstitutional rights were violated; she alleged a substantial\nfederalclaim,whichwasnotdismissed,andultimatelyprevailed\non her state constitutional claim. The Gibbs test was satisfied\nbecausebothclaimsarosefroma commonnucleus ofoperative\nfacts. Accordingly, Mrs. Davis was a prevailing party under §\n1988.\nId.at 1236.15\nAfterDavisv.EverettcameFederationofCityEmployeesv.CityofBirmingham,492\nSo.2d 1304 (Ala. 1986), which was an appeal from the trial court's denial of the plaintiff’s\nmotion for attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, with the following facts involved:\nThe employees initially filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nalleging violations of both federalconstitutional law and state\nlaw, inorder to obtain a three percent (3%) pay raise provided\ninBudgetOrdinance Number83-103, which had beenadopted\nby the Birmingham City Council. The trial court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the employees, but specifically\nstated that the constitutional due process claim alleged by the\nemployees was premature and that no decision concerning it\n15\nThe\"Gibbstest\"referredtointhisquotecomesfromUnitedMineWorkersofAmericav.Gibbs,383\nU.S.715,86S.Ct.1130(1966).

TheU.S.SupremeCourttherefoundthatsuchjurisdictionappliesifthestateand\nfederalclaimsarederivedfromthesamenucleusoffacts.\n43\n\nwould be rendered.\nId.at 1305. Inaffirmingthedenialof fees,theSupremeCourtreliedonSmithv. Robinson,\n468 U.S.992, 104 S.Ct. 3457 (1984) -- which followed the Davis v. Everett decision– to\nconclude that “a prevailing plaintiff may be awarded reasonable attorney fees based on a\nsubstantial, unaddressed constitutional claim, if that claim is reasonably related to the\nultimatesuccess.” Id. at 1306. If the federal claim fails to present a justiciable issue -- for\nexample,if the federalclaim isunripe-- thenitcannot bereasonablyrelatedtothe ultimate\nsuccess achieved bya plaintiff.\nThiscaseappearscloserto Davisv. EverettthantotheFederationofCityEmployees\ncase. While the Court rejected the plaintiffs’ federal claim under 42 U.S.C. §1971, the\nplaintiffs’ equal protection/due process claims under CountSix werenot reached, with the\nCourt’s ruling instead premised on its analysis of state constitutional rights. The claims of\nCountSix, and the dueprocess analysis used inresolvingthe other claims inthe plaintiffs’\nfavor, however, certainly suggest that at least to some extent, relief to the plaintiffs could\nhave been based on federal constitutional claims. An attorneys’ fee award thus appears\nproper under the authority of the Davis case. The question then becomes what amount is\nproperlyawarded.\nThegoverning law on this issue was most recently addressed in Beal Bank, SSB v.\nSchilleci,896 So.2d395 (Ala.2004). TheSupremeCourtthere firstrecognized the factors\nestablishedin Peebles v. Miley, 439 So.2d 137 (Ala. 1983), which a court mayconsider in\njudging the reasonableness of an attorneys' fee request:\n(1) the nature and value of the subject matter of the\nemployment; (2) the learning, skill, and labor requisite to its\nproper discharge; (3) the time consumed; (4)the professional\nexperienceandreputation ofthe attorney; (5) theweightof his\nresponsibilities; (6) the measure of success achieved; (7) the\nreasonable expenses incurred; (8) whether a fee is fixed or\ncontingent; (9) the nature and length of a professional\nrelationship; (10)thefeecustomarilychargedinthelocalityfor\nsimilar legal services; (11) the likelihood that a particular\nemploymentmayprecludeotheremployment; and(12)thetime\nlimitations imposed bythe client or bythe circumstances.\n896So.2d at403. Noteveryoneofthesefactorsmustbeconsideredineverycase,however;\nrather,the Peebleslist providesconsiderationsthatmayfactorintoananalysisdepending on\nthe circumstances of a given case. Id. ThisCourt has considerable discretion in weighing\n44\n\nthefactorsinvolvedandmayundertakeitsownevaluation of thevalueof servicesmade the\nsubject of an application. Id., quoting Dent v.

Id., at 404-05.\nTheCourtfirstaddressesthe measureof success achieved. Whiletheplaintiffsmay\nnot have prevailed on all their claims, the relief provided herein appears to be all that the\nplaintiffscouldhaveaskedfor(indeed,thereliefcanberegardedasexceedingtheplaintiffs’\nprayersincethisCourt’sanalysisgoesbeyondthe issuesexplicitlyraisedby theparties). As\naresultof thisorder,the defendantsareobligatedtorevamptheir proceduresforregistering\nvoters,sothatnoonemaybedeniedthe righttoregister becauseof apriorfelonyconviction\n(at least not until there is legislation implementing sub-paragraph (b) of Amendment 579).\nThis changeissignificantinitsscopeandnature,anditaffectsallmembersof theclass,of\nwhich there are thousands.\nThislitigationhasraisedsignificantissues,impactingon thefundamental civilrights\nofthousands ofcitizensresiding inthisState. Forthisreason,theCourtplacesemphasison\nthefirstPeeblesfactoridentified above,which is“thenatureand valueof thesubject matter\nof the employment.” This also calls into playthe second Peebles factor in that this type of\nlitigationrequires specialized knowledge andexperience invotingrightslitigation inorder\ntoeffectively prosecute the claims of class members. The uniqueness of this kind of case,\nin and of itself, bears consideration.\nTheCourt furtherfindsthattheplaintiffs’localcounsel, EdwardStill,enjoysa well-\ndeserved reputation as a preeminent voting rightsattorney. This reputation is based on his\nexperience dating back many years. Attorney Ryan Haygood is a much younger attorney,\nhavingbeeninpracticesince2001. Itappearsthatforthepastthreeyears,however,hehas\nworked primarily, if not exclusively, on this type of litigation.\nTheCourtrecognizestheaffidavittestimonyofattorneysJackDrake,JimBlacksher,\nGayleGear, and Alicia Haynes, also experienced attorneys in this area of lawwho enjoy a\ntop-notchreputation.

AttorneysBlacksherandDraketestifythata100%enhancementof\nthe lodestar amount would be proper.\nAttorneyStill has provided time logs showing that approximately 112 hours were\nloggedon thismatter. AttorneyHaygood’srecordsreflect117hourslogged. Thiscasedid\nnotrequire extensive discovery,and the partieswerenot requiredto participate ina trial of\nthis matter. On the other hand, the attorneys did have to prepare for a class certification\n45\n\nhearing. Thestipulationsof fact reflect a gooddeal of workbytheattorneysforallparties,\nmoreover, and this litigation required briefing on numerous thornyissues of law.\nThetime billeddoesappearabit excessivehowever,andafter reviewingtherecords,\nthis Courtdetermines that a reasonable time for which an award is proper is 101 hours for\nMr.Still and 105 hours for Mr. Haygood. This Court further determines that a reasonable\nhourlybilling rateforMr.Stillis $350,while thatof Mr.Haygoodis $260. These lead toa\ncalculation of $35,350 in fees for Mr. Still and $27,300in fees for Mr.Haygood. Further,\ntheCourtrecognizesthat Mr.Still hasincurredexpenses of$1,295, whileMr.Haygoodhas\nincurred expenses of $2,079.\nThisCourt declinestorecognizeanenhancementof theloadstaramounts,giventhat\nthe plaintiffsenjoyed only partial success, and that success was in part on grounds having\nnothingtodo withfederalconstitutional rightsthat could formthe basis of anaward under\n42U.S.C. §1988(e.g.,theseparation-of-powersanalysisleadingtotheconclusionthatsub-\nparagraph(b)of Amendment579maynotcurrently beenforced). Ontheotherhand,given\nthescope of the issues presented inthis caseand the fundamentalsignificance of the rights\nforwhichredressishereinprovided,noreductionoftheloadstaramountsappearswarranted,\neither.\nThis Court therefore awards to Mr. Still $36,645 in fees and expenses and to Mr.\nHaygood$29,379infees and expenses. These amountsare taxed as coststoboththe State\ndefendants and to the defendant class of registrars, with the understanding that a county\nregistrar is a state officer. See, e.g., Garner v. McCall, 178 So.2d 210, 212 (Ala. 1938);\nMitchell v. Wright, 69 F.Supp. 698, 702 (M.D. Ala. 1947). The defendants are ordered to\nremit these costs directlyto the plaintiffs’ attorneys.\nIV. Conclusion\nTheCourt recognizes that this orderchanges a practicethat dates back manyyears.\nTherehave beenvariouscontextsinwhich courtshaveaddressedwhether particularcrimes\ninvolve moral turpitude, with scant attention paid to any constitutional concerns. Upon\nrecognizing that the disenfranchisement provision of Amendment 579 to the Alabama\nConstitutionauthorizesthe impositionofacriminalpenalty,however,the situationchanges.\nOur constitutional rights mandate that government tread carefullyin imposing punishment\nfor crimes, given the significance of the consequences. Under modern American\njurisprudenceofcriminallaw,forexample,well-developedproceduresareinplacetoensure\nthat any criminal punishment constituting a deprivation of liberty is in accord with every\ncitizen’s fundamental protections under our state and federal constitutions.\n46\n\nWe are not dealing with any deprivation of liberty; at issue here is the possible\ndeprivationofacitizen’sfundamentalrighttovoteasaresultofacriminalconviction. From\ntheevidencebeforetheCourt,thousands ofcitizensresidinginJeffersonCountyalonehave\nincurred this punishment for their wrongs. Let there be no mistake: the State of Alabama\ndoes have the constitutional authority to impose such a criminal penalty, and this order\nshould not beregarded as holding to the contrary. Any imposition of this type of penalty,\nhowever, mustbe in keeping with the protections we all enjoy under our state and federal\nconstitutions, meaning that it must be done in the right way.\nIntheabsenceofanylegislativepronouncement,neitherthisCourtnoranyothercourt\nhasthe constitutional authority to decide whether anindividual must surrender his rightto\nvotebecauseofapriorfelonyconviction.

The task is one for our Legislature to undertake. Only the Legislature has the\nconstitutional power to decide which crimes involve moral turpitude so as to justify the\nremovalof a fundamental civilright for which so many have fought and died. This Court\ncannot here restrict the Legislature’s power, moreover. So long as the decision-making\nprocess is free of illegal discriminatory motivation, it is the Legislature’s prerogative to\ndecide which, if any, felonies are to be regarded as involving moral turpitude.\nAll this Court can do now is decide what happens pending any such action by the\nAlabamaLegislature.

Until suchtime that there is a statute on the books specifying\nwhich crimesmay properlyserve as a basis of disenfranchisement, no defendant may take\nanyaction to interfere with a citizen’s registration because of anycriminal conviction.\nIn accordance with the above, the following is herebyORDERED:\n1.

OF ALABAMA\n \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \nRICHARD GOODEN, ANDREW JONES, and   \nEKEYESTO DOSS,  \n      Plaintiffs,  Civil Action No. 2:05-cv-2562 \nv.   \n \n \nNANCY WORLEY, in her official capacity as \nAlabama Secretary of State; NELL HUNTER,   \nin her official capacity as Jefferson County \nVoter Registrar; and ANITA GIBSON, \nWALTER LONG, and MOLLY MEADOWS in \ntheir official capacities as Houston County \nVoter Registrars, \n \n      Defendants. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECTION 5 ENFORCEMENT ACTION BRIEF \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nMore than four decades after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, in \nclear contravention of the requirements that it places on Alabama, Defendant voting \nofficials are implementing policies and procedures for voter registration that are required \nto be, but have not been, “precleared” under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 \nU.S.C.  §  1973c,  as  amended.    Specifically,  while  Alabama  has  duly  enacted  and \nprecleared a provision that denies the vote only to those citizens convicted of felonies \ninvolving  moral  turpitude,  Defendant  Secretary  of  State,  Alabama’s  chief  election \nofficial,  has  unlawfully  instructed  voter  registrars  throughout  the  State  to  refuse \nregistration to all individuals with felony convictions, including those presently eligible \n \n1\n\ncitizens convicted of felony offenses not involving moral turpitude.1  Defendants have not \nobtained, nor even sought, preclearance to implement this change in voting registration \nprocedure.  Defendants’ failure to comply with the preclearance procedures that Section 5 \nof the Voting Rights Act mandates has resulted in the unlawful denial of the right to vote \nto Plaintiffs and a substantial but undetermined number of similarly situated Alabama \ncitizens.    \nHowever,  this  limited  Section  5  enforcement  action  seeks  only  to  enjoin  the \nDefendants’ impermissible implementation of voter registration procedures for which \nthey have failed to obtain the required preclearance.  If left unchecked, the Defendants’ \nviolation of Section 5 will continue to permit state and local officials to deny the vote to \neligible citizens of Alabama.   \nII.       FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n    From Reconstruction until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the State \nof Alabama employed virtually every state instrument of disfranchisement available to \nsuppress  the  Black  vote,  including  terror  and  violence,  literacy  tests,  poll  taxes,  a \n“grandfather clause,” good character tests, and white-only primaries.  As a result of its \n                                              \n1   In Ex parte McIntosh, 443 So.2d 1283, 1284 (Ala. 1983), the Alabama Supreme \nCourt cited C. Gamble, McElroy’s Alabama Evidence, § 145.01(7) (3d ed. 1977):  \nThe Supreme Court of Alabama has defined the term “moral turpitude” on many \noccasions and the following are the most commonly found definitions.  Moral \nturpitude signifies an inherent quality of baseness, vileness and depravity.  It is \nimmoral in itself, regardless of the fact that it is punished by law.  Therefore, an \noffense for conviction of which a witness’ credibility is lessened must be mala in \nse and not mala prohibitum. \nFor a list of crimes that have been held by Alabama appellate courts to involve (or not to \ninvolve) moral turpitude, see Appendix A to this brief. \n \n2\n\nlong history of discrimination against Blacks in voting, the entire State of Alabama is \ncovered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 pursuant to Section 4 of that \nstatute  and  the  Attorney  General’s  designation.    See  28  C.F.R.  pt.  51,  app.  (2004).  \nIndeed, following the 1982 renewal of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the \nSupreme Court recognized in Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985), that Alabama, \nin violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, intentionally \nused its disfranchisement law to disfranchise Blacks and to maintain and reinforce white \nsupremacy.    \nIn 1995, the Alabama Legislature adopted, and the people subsequently ratified, \nAct 95-443, which proposed a constitutional amendment to repeal Article VIII of the \nConstitution of Alabama of 1901 regarding voting, and replace it with Section 177.  Doc. \n21  (Stip.)  ¶  2.    The  Alabama  Constitution,  Article  VIII,  Section  177  (Recompiled), \nprovides in pertinent part: \n(a) Every citizen of the United States who has attained the age of eighteen years \nand has resided in this state and in a county thereof for the time provided by law, if \nregistered as provided by law, shall have the right to vote in the county of his or \nher residence. The Legislature may prescribe reasonable and nondiscriminatory \nrequirements as prerequisites to registration for voting. The Legislature shall, by \nstatute, prescribe a procedure by which eligible citizens can register to vote. \n \n(b) No person convicted of a felony involving moral turpitude, or who is mentally \nincompetent, shall be qualified to vote until restoration of civil and political rights \nor removal of disability.   \n \nDoc. 21 (Stip.) ¶ 3 (emphasis added).   \n \nPursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the State of Alabama \nsubmitted Act No. 95-443 to the Attorney General of the United States for preclearance.  \n \n3\n\nIn a June 24, 1996 letter the U.S. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights interposed \nno objection to Alabama’s revised voting law.  Doc. 21 (Stip.) ¶ 4.  Accordingly, Act No. \n95-443 was precleared.  Id.  \nIn the 2003 Second Special Session, the Alabama Legislature adopted Act 2003-\n415, codified at Ala. Code § 15-22-36.1 (Supp. 2005), a law requiring members of the \nAlabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to provide a procedure for the restoration of \nvoting rights — by issuing a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote (“Certificate of \nEligibility”) — to individuals with felony convictions who satisfactorily complete each of \nthe terms and conditions of their sentences.  Doc. 21 (Stip.) ¶ 22. \nIn the course of discharging its statutory duties, the Alabama Board of Pardons \nand Paroles determined that there is public confusion about the scope of the State of \nAlabama’s felon disfranchisement law, and that the Secretary of State and Defendant \nRegistrars are misapplying Alabama’s law, thereby creating confusion which deprives \neligible citizens of their right to register to vote and exercise the franchise.  To facilitate \ncompliance with Ala. Code § 15-22-36.1 (Supp. 2005), and to determine which felonies \nrequire the issuance of a Certificate of Eligibility as a prerequisite to registering to vote, \nWilliam  Segrest,  Executive  Director  of  the  Alabama  Board  of  Pardons  and  Paroles, \nrequested that Troy King, Attorney General for the State of Alabama, set forth which \nfelonies do not involve moral turpitude under state law.  In response to Segrest’s request, \nthe Attorney General issued an opinion (the “Opinion”) which explained that “[i]f a \nperson has been convicted of a felony that does not involve moral turpitude, that person \nremains eligible to vote and is therefore ineligible to apply [to the Alabama Board of \n \n4\n\nPardons and Paroles] for a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote.”  See Ala. Op. \nAtty. Gen. No. 2005-092 (March 18, 2005), 2005 WL 1121853 (Ala. A.G.).   Doc. 21 \n(Stip.) ¶ 30. \nIn the Opinion, the Attorney General did not “provide an exhaustive list of every \nfelony involving moral turpitude,” but listed a number of illustrative crimes that have \nbeen determined by Alabama courts not to involve moral turpitude, including “violation \nof liquor laws” and “driving under the influence.”  Id. at 2 (citing Parker v. State, 280 \nAla. 685, 198 So. 2d 261 (1967); Finley v. State, 661 So. 2d 1321 (Ala. Crim. App. \n1995)).  Thus, if “a person is convicted solely of a felony that does not involve moral \nturpitude, that person remains eligible to vote.”  Id. at 3.2 \nNotwithstanding the efforts of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles and the \nAttorney General to notify Alabama’s citizens about the correct application of the State’s \nlaw through a press release, see Doc. 21 (Stip.) ¶ 32, registrars throughout the State, \nunder the advice and instruction of the Secretary of State, the chief election official, are \n                                              \n2   The Attorney General also opined that each crime listed as an exception to the \nCertificate of Eligibility procedure is a crime of moral turpitude.  No Alabama court has \nheld that these crimes are crimes of moral turpitude.  Nor did the State notify the Justice \nDepartment that the listed crimes would be considered crimes of moral turpitude.  The \nfailure to make such a disclosure in the submission is fatal to any contention that the \nJustice Department has precleared the use of the list as a (partial or full) definition of \n“moral turpitude.”  As the District Court said eight years ago:  \nIt has long been the law that in order to successfully obtain preclearance of a \nvoting change from the Attorney General, the State submitting the change must \n“in some unambiguous and recordable manner submit any legislation or regulation \nin question directly to the Attorney General with a request for his consideration \npursuant to the [Voting Rights] Act.”  See Allen [v. State Board of Elections], 393 \nU.S.[544] at 571, 89 S.Ct. [817] at 834-35 [(1969)] (emphasis added). \nWard v. Alabama, 31 F.Supp.2d 968, 971 (M.D. Ala. 1998) (3-judge court). \n \n5\n\nemploying practices and procedures that are inconsistent with Alabama’s Act No. 95-\n443,  which  was  properly  precleared  under  Section  5.    Doc.  21  (Stip.)  ¶  25.3    The \nSecretary of State has given written and oral advice to registrars to continue the pre-1966 \npractice of disfranchising all felons.  Doc. 21 (Stip.) ¶¶ 34, 35, 67. \nThese contrary procedures have not themselves been submitted for preclearance, \nin violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.   \nThe effect of these practices is to deny the vote to Plaintiffs and to a substantial \nbut undetermined number of similarly situated citizens across the State of Alabama. \nIII.       ARGUMENT \nDEFENDANT SECRETARY OF STATE AND DEFENDANT REGISTRARS HAVE  \nVIOLATED SECTION 5 OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973C,        AS \nAMENDED, BY ADMINISTERING VOTING PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES  \nTHAT HAVE NOT BEEN, BUT ARE REQUIRED TO BE, PRECLEARED  \nPURSUANT TO SECTION 5 OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT \n \nBecause of its long history of discrimination against Blacks in voting, Section 5 of \nthe  Voting  Rights  Act  covers  the  entire  State  of  Alabama,  see  42  U.S.C.  §  1973c,  \npursuant to Section 4 of that statute and the designation by the Attorney General.  See 42 \nU.S.C.  §  1973b;  see  also,  28  C.F.R.  pt.  51,  app.  (2004);  Connors  v.  Bennett,  202 \nF.Supp.2d 1308, 1317 (M.D. Ala. 2002) (3-judge court).  As a result of this coverage, the \nState of Alabama is prohibited by Section 5 from “enact[ing] or seek[ing] to administer    \n                                              \n3    Since the filing of the state court suit, some registrars have shifted their practices.  \nDoc. 21 (Stip.) ¶¶ 26-27.  The Secretary of State has also proposed a change in the voter \nregistration forms so that the statement of qualifications to register will say that the \napplicant has not been convicted of a “disqualifying felony” rather than a “felony.”  Cf. \nDoc. 21 (Stip.) ¶ 13; Doc. 21 (Stip.) ¶ 66. \n \n6\n\n. . . any standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in \nforce  or  effect  on  November  1,  1964”  until  the  State  obtains  either  judicial  or \nadministrative preclearance from the federal government.  Id. (emphasis added); see also, \nYoung v. Fordice, 520 U.S. 273, 276 (1997); Boxx v. Bennett, 50 F.Supp.2d 1219, 1223 \n(M.D. Ala. 1999) (3-judge court).  Accordingly, no new voting standard, practice or \nprocedure is enforceable in the State of Alabama unless and until the State has sought, \nand successfully obtained, preclearance.  Lopez v. Monterey County, 519 U.S. 9, 20 \n(1996); see also, Clark v. Roemer, 500 U.S. 646, 652-653 (1991); McDaniel v. Sanchez, \n452 U.S. 130, 137 (1981). \nUnder Section 5, the role of this three-judge court is sharply circumscribed to the \nfollowing three-part inquiry:  (1) whether state or local officials are administering a \nstandard, practice or procedure that constitutes a “change” of Alabama Constitution, Art. \nVIII Section 177 that is subject to preclearance under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act; \n(2) if the standard, practice or procedure constitutes a voting change (and is thus subject \nto preclearance), whether the requirements of Section 5 were satisfied; and (3) if the \nrequirements were not satisfied, what remedy is appropriate to cure that wrong.  See \nHenderson v. Graddick, 641 F.Supp. 1192, 1198 (M.D. Ala. 1986) (3-judge court); see \nalso, Lopez, 519 U.S. at 23 (“The three-judge district court may determine only whether § \n5 covers a contested change, whether § 5’s approval requirements were satisfied, and if \nthe requirements were not satisfied, what temporary remedy, if any, is appropriate.”); \nCity  of  Lockhart  v.  United  States,  460  U.S.  125,  129  n.3  (1983)  (“In  granting  the \ninjunction . . . [a]ll [the district court] could do was determine (i) whether a change was \n \n7\n\ncovered by § 5, (ii) if the change was covered, whether § 5’s approval requirements were \nsatisfied, and (iii) if the requirements were not satisfied, what remedy was appropriate.”); \nUnited States v. Bd. of Supervisors of Warren County, 429 U.S. 642, 645-646 (1977) \n(“the inquiry of a local district court in a § 5 action against a State or political subdivision \nis limited to the determination whether a voting requirement is covered by § 5, but has \nnot been subjected to the required federal scrutiny.”) (internal quotations and citations \nomitted); Brooks v. Ga. State Bd. of Elections, 997 F.2d 857, 867 (11th Cir. 1993) \n(same).  The Supreme Court has held that an action under Section 5 seeking to enjoin \nvoting procedures that have not been precleared merely aims to “preserv[e] the status quo \nuntil the Attorney General or the courts have an opportunity to evaluate a proposed \nchange.”  Young, 520 U.S. at 285 (1997). \nGiven  the  Voting  Rights  Act’s  aim  of  preventing  “the  subtle,  as  well  as  the \nobvious, state regulations which have the effect of denying citizens their right to vote \nbecause  of  their  race,”  the  Supreme  Court  has  broadly  construed  what  constitutes  a \n“change” under Section 5.  Presley v. Etowah County Comm’n, 502 U.S. 491, 501-03 \n(1992) (quoting Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S. 544 (1969)).  Voting changes \ncovered under Section 5 “may be informal as well as formal changes,” see Foreman v. \nDallas County, 521 U.S. 979, 980 (1997), may alter an election law in only “a minor \nway,” see Presley, 502 U.S. at 501, and they may even include “an administrative effort \nto comply with a statute that had already received preclearance” or legislation passed “in \nan attempt to comply with provisions of the Act.”  Foreman, 521 U.S. at 980.  “Nor does \n \n8\n\nit matter for the preclearance requirement whether the change works in favor of, works \nagainst, or is neutral in its impact upon the ability of minorities to vote.  It is the change \nthat invokes the preclearance process; evaluation of that change concerns the merits of \nwhether the change should in fact be precleared.”  Young, 520 U.S. at 285 (emphasis \nadded); see also, NAACP v. Hampton County Election Comm’n, 470 U.S. 166, 178 \n(1985)  (holding  that  “the  form  of  a  change  in  voting  procedures  cannot  determine \nwhether it is within the scope of § 5 . . . [since] [t]hat section reaches informal as well as \nformal changes, such as a bulletin issued by a state board of elections.”).   \nIn applying these well-established principles to the instant case, the facts show that \nthe Defendant Secretary of State violated Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act by failing to \nsubmit for preclearance her official advice to registrars throughout the State of Alabama \nto refuse to register eligible voters.   \n1.   Defendant Secretary of State’s Advice and Instruction to Registrars \nThroughout the State of Alabama to Refuse Registration to All People \nwith  Felony  Convictions  Constitutes  A  Change  in  Practice  or \nProcedure  that  is  Required  to  Be,  But  Has  Not  Been,  Precleared \nPursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  \nAs discussed supra, Article VIII, Section 177, of the Alabama Constitution was \nadopted by the people and precleared by the Department of Justice in 1996.  Accordingly, \nSection 177 is the law of Alabama with respect to felon disfranchisement in the State and \nconstitutes the benchmark for Section 5 purposes.   \nContrary to the established benchmark for voting practices and procedures in the \nState of Alabama, the Defendant Secretary of State has advised and instructed registrars \n \n9\n\nto refuse to register any individual with a felony conviction — without regard to whether \nor not such felony involved moral turpitude — without a Certificate of Eligibility.  As a \nresult, registrars throughout Alabama, pursuant to the advice of the Secretary of State, are \nemploying practices and procedures that are both inconsistent with precleared Section \n177 and have not themselves been submitted for preclearance, in violation of Section 5 of \nthe Voting Rights Act.   \nThe effect of the Secretary of State’s practice is to deny the vote to Plaintiffs, and \nto a substantial but undetermined number of other similarly situated citizens of Alabama.4 \nThis practice is covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.   \n   The District Court’s ruling in Henderson v. Graddick, 641 F.Supp. 1192 (M.D. Ala. \n1986), is particularly instructive.  In Henderson, a three-judge panel of the District Court \nconsidered  whether  the  Alabama  Attorney  General,  a  candidate  for  the  Democratic \nParty’s nomination for governor, violated Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act when, \nwithout  preclearing  his  actions,  he  “advised  voters”  who  had  voted  in  the  State’s \nRepublican primary to participate in the Democratic gubernatorial runoff in violation of \nthe Democratic party rules prohibiting cross-over voting.  Id. at 1194.   \nIn looking first at the Democratic Party’s anti-crossover voting rule, the District \nCourt recognized that “[p]ursuant to Section 5’s commands, this rule was submitted to \nthe Attorney General of the United States and was approved, i.e., ‘precleared’ by him . . . \n                                              \n4   The  Alabama  Board  of  Pardons  and  Paroles,  for  example,  has  identified  330 \nindividuals from across the State of Alabama who applied for a Certificate of Eligibility \nbut were found to be already eligible to vote because they had been convicted of felonies \nnot involving moral turpitude.  Doc. 21 (Stip.) ¶¶ 63-64.   \n \n10\n\nfor enforcement as a valid, nondiscriminatory provision of Alabama law.”  Id. at 1195.  \nThe anti-crossover rule, the District Court continued, “is thus enforceable and may not be \nmodified or voided without first obtaining approval” from the Attorney General of the \nUnited States or from a three-judge court in the District of Columbia.  Id.  “Once a law \nhas been precleared it may be enforced whenever violated, and any change in the law or \nany practice inconsistent with the law must itself be precleared or be in violation of \nSection 5.”  Id. at 1201. \nFocusing  next  on  the  Attorney  General’s  actions,  the  Court,  recognizing  the \nAttorney General as the “chief legal officer of the State of Alabama,” noted that he, \nthrough his advice and encouragement to voters, “made every effort to get voters to \nviolate the [precleared] anti-crossover rule.”  Id. (emphasis added).  As a result, the \nCourt concluded: \nSince this rule was clearly authorized by Alabama statute and since the rule had \nbeen precleared by the Attorney General of the United States in 1980, we hold that \nthe Attorney General’s actions effected a change in procedure with respect to \nvoting.  This change was not “precleared” as required by the Voting Rights Act.  \nThe Act has, therefore, been violated. \n \nId.    \nIn  this  case,  the  Defendant  Secretary  of  State,  like  the  Attorney  General  in \nHenderson, has advised registrars throughout the State of Alabama to refuse to follow \nAlabama’s precleared law.  Like the Attorney General’s advice to voters in Henderson, \nthe Defendant Secretary of State’s advice to registrars effected a change in practice and \nprocedure with respect to voting that is subject to Section 5.  Further, that the Defendant \nSecretary of State’s actions constitute a voting change is clearly demonstrated by the \n \n11\n\nunlawful  vote  denial  that  is  resulting  from  the  registrars’  implementation  of  the \nDefendant Secretary of State’s advice.    \nThe  Alabama  Code  declares  the  Secretary  of  State  to  be  the  “chief  elections \nofficial”  in  the  State  of  Alabama  who  “shall  provide  uniform  guidance  for  election \nactivities.”  Ala. Code § 17-1-8 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).  The Alabama Code also \nprovides that the “Secretary of State may promulgate rules for the receipt of applications \nfor voter registration and the expedient administration of those applications.”  Ala. Code \n§ 17-4-136 (Supp. 2005). \nAs the chief elections official, the Secretary of State is required to follow and \nfacilitate, not undermine, the implementation of Alabama’s Constitution and laws.  Here, \nnotwithstanding the plain language of precleared Act No. 95-443, the Secretary of State \nhas advised registrars throughout the State of Alabama to refuse to register persons, \nincluding  Plaintiffs,  who  are  currently  eligible  to  register  to  vote  under  the  law,  in \nviolation of Section 5.  See Doc. 21 (Stip.) ¶¶ 33-35.   The Secretary of State’s advice to \nregistrars  throughout  the  State  of  Alabama  not  to  register  any  people  with  felony \nconvictions substantially departs from — and, in fact, ignores — the precleared Act No. \n95-443, and triggers Section 5’s preclearance requirement.  See Ritter v. Bennett, 23 \nF.Supp.2d  1334,  1340  (M.D.  Ala.  1998)  (3-judge  court)  (suggesting  that  “the  broad \ndissemination  of  misleading  information  .  .  .  could  constitute  a  change  within  the \nmeaning of § 5.”).  Accordingly, the Secretary of State’s advice to registrars is clearly a \nvoting practice and procedure that contradicts, enlarges and frustrates Act No. 95-443 and \n \n12\n\nconstitutes a voting change within the meaning of Section 5.  The Secretary of State’s \naction must be precleared pursuant to Section 5 before it may legally take effect. \n2.  The  Defendant  Secretary  of  State  and  Defendant  Registrars  Have \nFailed to Satisfy the Requirements of Section 5 of the Voting Right Act.   \nThe second part of this Court’s sharply circumscribed inquiry, after finding that \nthe  voting  change  in  the  instant  case  is  covered  under  Section  5,  is  whether  the \nDefendants have satisfied the requirements of Section 5.  See Henderson, 641 F.Supp. at \n1198.  Because Defendants have not sought preclearance for their change in practice or \nprocedure, Defendants simply cannot satisfy the second part of this Court’s inquiry.   \nIndeed, in an effort to distract this Court’s attention from the fact of the clear violation of \nSection 5 in this case, the Defendant Secretary of State asserts that she does not have “the \nauthority under state law to ‘direct’ county registrars’ decision [sic] to grant or refuse \nindividual applications to register to vote.”  See Doc. 7 (Def. Sec. of State’s Answer to \nPls.’ Compl.) ¶ 32.   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s assertion is not supported by Defendant Jefferson \nCounty Registrar, who “[a]dmitted” that it had been “directed by the Secretary of State \nnot to register people with any felony conviction — whether or not the felony involved \nmoral turpitude — without a Certificate of Eligibility.”  See Doc. 9 (Def. Jeff. Co. \nRegist.’s Answer to Pls.’ Compl.) ¶ 32; see also Doc 9 ¶ 41 (Admitting that “Defendant \nJefferson County Registrar informed the Board of Pardons that the Defendant Secretary \nof State had directed them not to register individuals with felony convictions who had not \n \n13\n\nobtained  a  Certificate  of  Eligibility,  without  regard  to  whether  or  not  such  felony \nconvictions involved moral turpitude.”).   \nThe precise language used to define the Defendant Secretary of State’s conduct, \nwhether  it  is  identified  as  “directing,”  “advising,”  “providing  guidance”  or \n“encouraging,” is not as significant as the manner in which it is being received, and acted \nupon, by the registrars to the detriment of Plaintiffs and other similarly situated citizens \nin the State of Alabama.  See Hampton County, 470 U.S. at 178 (holding that because the \nform of a change in voting procedure is irrelevant to a Section 5 coverage determination, \nadministrative changes can trigger the preclearance requirement).  Indeed, as a practical \nmatter, the fact that the Secretary of State has the authority to remove registrars makes \nthe Defendant Secretary of State’s inquiry into the precise nature of her authority over \nregistrars largely academic in nature.  See Ala. Code § 17-4-151 (Supp. 2005) (“The \nregistrars appointed under this article may be removed for cause by the Secretary of State \nat  any  time  before  the  end  of  their  term  of  office,  upon  submitting  written  reasons \ntherefore to the registrar removed and the members of the appointing board.”).  \n3.  The Defendant Secretary of State’s Continuing Violation of Section 5 \nof the Voting Rights Act Must Be Enjoined.   \n \nThe final prong of this Court’s narrow inquiry, after finding that the voting change \nin the instant case is covered under Section 5 and that the requirements under Section 5 \nhave  not  been  satisfied,  requires  a  determination  of  the  appropriate  remedy.    See \nHenderson, 641 F.Supp. at 1198.  In fashioning its remedy for the violation of Section 5, \nthe Court in Henderson noted that its objective was “only to vindicate the requirement \n \n14\n\nthat no change may be effected governing the rules for the conduct of elections unless \nsuch change is precleared pursuant to the commands of Section 5,” and not, as the \nplaintiffs urged the court, to act “as a contest committee of the Democratic Party to \ndetermine the winner of the election.”  Id. at 1204.  In addition to ordering the drastic \nremedy  of  a  runoff  election,  the  three-judge  panel  in  Henderson  also  enjoined  the \nAttorney General and his successors “from seeking any change in the Democratic Party \nrule  affecting  crossover  voting  without  following  the  procedures  for  effecting  such \nchange prescribed by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.”  Id.     \nLike the plaintiffs in Henderson, the Plaintiffs in this case urge this Court to enter \na declaratory judgment that Defendant Secretary of State’s actions violate Section 5 of \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965.  See Pls.’ Compl., ¶ 60.   Plaintiffs also request that this \nCourt enter a declaratory judgment that Defendant Secretary of State and Defendant \nRegistrars lack the authority, unless and until Defendants obtain preclearance for such \npractices and procedures after submitting those practices and procedures for preclearance, \nas required by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, to preclude individuals convicted of \nfelonies not involving moral turpitude from registering to vote under Alabama law.  Id.    \nAs the Court in Henderson made clear, this relief is appropriate, given the facts of \nthe instant case, under Section 5.  See Lopez, 519 U.S. at 24 (“The goal of a three-judge \ndistrict court facing a § 5 challenge must be to ensure that the covered jurisdiction \nsubmits  its  election  plan  to  the  appropriate  federal  authorities  for  preclearance  as \nexpeditiously as possible.”); see also, Young, 520 U.S. at 291 (court ordered remedy for \nMississippi’s failure to preclear voting practices was to enjoin use of State’s unprecleared \n \n15\n\nchanges).  Finally, Plaintiffs request the award of reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses, \nand costs under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973l(e) and 1988, and such other, further, and different \nrelief as the facts and circumstances may warrant.  See Pls.’ Compl., ¶ 61-62. \nIV.  ADDITIONAL ISSUES \nAt the Status and Scheduling Conference (“Status Conference”) on March 7, 2006, \nthis Court requested briefing as to several specific issues, in addition to the core issues \ndiscussed above.  It is to those additional issues raised by this Court that we now turn. \n1.  Hunter v. Underwood and the “Felonies That Involve Moral Turpitude” \nClassification.   \n \nDuring the Status Conference, this Court questioned whether the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985), implicitly upheld the State of \nAlabama’s  use  of  the  classification  of  “felonies  that  involve  moral  turpitude”  for \npurposes of voting.  Conf. Tr. 9:10-22.  \nAs an initial matter, the Plaintiffs in this action are not challenging the State of \nAlabama’s “felonies that involve moral turpitude” classification as ambiguous, but rather \nare  challenging  the  Secretary  of  State’s  continuing  advice  and  encouragement  to \nregistrars throughout the State of Alabama to deny registration to all people with felony \nconvictions, without regard to whether such offenses involve moral turpitude, which is a \nvoting practice or procedure that contradicts, enlarges and frustrates Act No. 95-443, and \nis thus subject to preclearance under the Voting Rights Act.   \nIn any event, however, the Supreme Court in Hunter did not address — either \nimplicitly or explicitly — the propriety of the “moral turpitude” classification itself. \n \n16\n\nRather,  Hunter  struck  down  the  prior  provision  of  the  Alabama  constitution  that \ndisfranchised  those  convicted  of  misdemeanors  listed  in  the  Alabama  Constitution \nbecause that provision was enacted with a racially discriminatory motive.  See Hunter, \n471 U.S. at 230.5  Indeed, the Supreme Court in Hunter explicitly stated that it rendered \nits opinion “[w]ithout deciding whether § 182 [which disfranchised those convicted of \nany  crime  involving  moral  turpitude]  would  be  valid  if  enacted  today  without  any \nimpermissible motivation.”  Id. at 233.  \n2.  Laches is Not A Defense to A Section 5 Preclearance Claim. \nThe Court also questioned whether laches is recognized as a defense to a Section 5 \npreclearance claim.  Conf. Tr. 10:23-25.  There are three reasons the Court need not take \nup the laches question. \nFirst, laches is an affirmative defense, and the Defendants have not pled it.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 8(c).  It is therefore waived.  See Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish School Bd., 594 \nF.2d 489, 495 (5th Cir. 1979). \nSecond, the weight of authority is that laches is not a cognizable defense to private \nsuits seeking injunctive relief under Section 5.  Henderson, 641 F.Supp. at 1200 (“laches \nis not a defense to a Section 5 claim”); Dotson v. City of Indianola, 514 F.Supp. 397, \n400-401 (N.D. Miss. 1982) (“laches is not available for a private action for injunctive \n                                              \n5   Although  the  decision  begins  by  stating  the  case  is  about  crimes  of  moral \nturpitude, Hunter, 471 U.S. at 223, it later states more accurately, “The case proceeded to \ntrial on two causes of action, including a claim that the misdemeanors encompassed \nwithin § 182 were intentionally adopted to disenfranchise blacks on account of their race \nand that their inclusion in § 182 has had the intended effect.”  Hunter, 471 U.S. at 224. \n \n17\n\nrelief brought under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act”), aff’d mem., 456 U.S. 1002 \n(1982); but see, Lauderdale County Sch. Dist. v. Enterprise Consol. Sch. Dist., 24 F.3d \n671, 692 (5th Cir. 1994) (“The doctrine of laches . . . may prevent a plaintiff from \nenjoining  [voting]  changes  effected  without  preclearance  as  required  by  the  Voting \nRights Act of 1965”).  In light of the absence of controlling precedent from the Supreme \nCourt or the Eleventh Circuit, this Court should follow the rulings in Henderson and \nDotson and hold that that laches is not a cognizable defense in this case.  \nThird, even assuming the availability of a laches defense, there is no factual basis \nfor the equitable laches defense in the instant case.  A defense of laches requires: (i) a \nlack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted; and (ii) prejudice to \nthe  party  asserting  the  defense.  AMTRAK  v.  Morgan,  536  U.S.  101,  121  (2002).  \nPlaintiffs demonstrated diligence in filing their state court action on September 29, 2005, \nless than one week after learning of Defendants’ illegal conduct.  Plaintiffs amended their \nstate  court  complaint  and  filed  a  complaint  in  this  case  on  December  19,  2005.   \nMoreover, there is no evidence that Defendants have suffered any prejudice, as required \nunder  the  Supreme  Court’s  test  in  AMTRAK.     Indeed,  on  the  facts  presented  here, \nrecognition of a laches defense would only serve to shield the intentional vote denial that \nis resulting from Defendants’ acts.  \n3.  The  Plaintiffs’  Race  Is  Not  Relevant  to  This  Court’s  Finding  That \nDefendants’ Actions Violate Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.       \n \nDuring the pretrial conference, this Court questioned whether the Plaintiffs’ race \nwas relevant to this action.  Specifically, this Court questioned whether there was an \n \n18\n\nunderlying race claim in this case, and whether such a claim was necessary to the case.  \nConf. Tr. 10:23-25.  \nThe Plaintiffs do not assert any race-based claims in their Complaint in this action. \nIndeed, that there is no requirement that Plaintiffs do so to secure an injunction against \nenforcement  of  the  Secretary  of  State’s  illegal  conduct  is  made  obvious  by  the \ncircumscribed nature of the three-judge court’s inquiry.  Specifically, as discussed supra, \nthe three-judge court is only permitted to consider the question of “coverage”: (i) whether \nthe practice or procedure is a voting change and thus subject to Section 5’s preclearance \nrequirement; and (ii) whether it has in fact been precleared.  Allen, 393 U.S. at 561.  \nThese questions are distinct from the substantive questions of whether, on the merits, the \nchallenged voting practice or procedure has the purpose or effect of denying the vote on \naccount of race or color. Id.; Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U.S. 379, 385 (1971); see also \nYoung, 520 U.S. at 285 (“Nor does it matter for the preclearance requirement whether the \nchange works in favor of, works against, or is neutral in its impact upon the ability of \nminorities to vote.”).  As such, while the three-judge court need not and should not “close \nits eyes” to the Congressional purposes behind Section 5, it is in fact prohibited from \nsubstantively considering whether the challenged practice has a racially discriminatory \npurpose or effect.  Perkins, 400 U.S. at 385-86; see also, Lopez, 519 U.S. at 24 (1996) \n(“On a complaint alleging failure to preclear election changes under § 5, [the three-judge \ndistrict] court lacks authority to consider the discriminatory purpose or nature of the \nchanges.”).  As the three-judge court is in fact precluded from considering claims that the \n \n19\n\nvoting change is racially discriminatory, it follows that Plaintiffs need not plead or raise \nsuch race-based claims in order to secure injunctive relief under Section 5. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set out above, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court find \nthat  the  Defendant  Secretary  of  State’s  advice  to  registrars  throughout  the  State  of \nAlabama to deny registration to all people with felony convictions qualifies as a voting \npractice or procedure that constitutes a voting change within the meaning of the Voting \nRights Act, which must be precleared pursuant to Section 5 before it may legally take \neffect. \nDated:    Birmingham, Alabama \n    April 7, 2006 \n \n  Submitted by, \n   \n   \n  /s/ Edward Still \nRyan Paul Haygood  Edward Still \nNAACP Legal Defense & Educational  2112 11th Avenue South \nFund, Inc.

      "text": " \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \nRICHARD GOODEN, ANDREW JONES, and   \nEKEYESTO DOSS,  \n      Plaintiffs,  Civil Action No. ____ \nv.   \n \nNANCY WORLEY, in her official capacity as \nAlabama Secretary of State; NELL HUNTER, \nin her official capacity as Jefferson County \nVoter Registrar; and ANITA GIBSON, \nWALTER LONG, and MOLLY MEADOWS in \ntheir official capacities as Houston County \nVoter Registrars, \n \n      Defendants. \n \nCOMPLAINT \nTHREE-JUDGE COURT REQUESTED \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis action is filed because, forty years after the passage of the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, citizens of Alabama are being denied the right to vote by state \nofficials  in  violation  of  state  and  federal  law  through  the  implementation  of \npolicies and procedures for voter registration that are required to be, but have not \nbeen, “precleared” pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.   \n1.  This is an action to enjoin violations of Section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1973c that, if left unchecked, will \npermit state and local officials to deny the vote to citizens of Alabama in violation \nof the law.   \n  1\n\nPLAINTIFFS \n2.  RICHARD GOODEN is a 64-year-old African American of lawful \nvoting age, a citizen of the United States and a lifetime resident of Birmingham, \nAlabama.   \n3.  Though Mr. Gooden wanted to register to vote when he turned 18, \nhe was not permitted to register to vote in the State of Alabama until his mid-20s \ndue to Alabama’s well-documented and systematic efforts to deny the right to vote \nto African-American citizens.  It was not until the passage of the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965 that Mr. Gooden, like thousands of African Americans, was finally \npermitted to vote in his home state.   \n4.  Mr. Gooden was registered to vote from the mid-1960s until 2000, \nwhen he was convicted of a felony — driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) \n— and informed by the State of Alabama that his voting rights were revoked as a \ncollateral consequence of his conviction.   \n5.  ANDREW  JONES  is  a  47-year-old  African  American  of  lawful \nvoting age, a citizen of the United States and a resident of Birmingham, Alabama.  \nMr. Jones was registered to vote from the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, when \nhe was convicted of felony possession of drugs, and informed by the State of \nAlabama that his voting rights were revoked as a collateral consequence of his \nconviction. \n6.  EKEYESTO DOSS is a 26-year-old African American of lawful \nvoting age, a citizen of the United States and a resident of Dothan, Alabama.  Mr. \nDoss was registered to vote from the late-1990s until early 2000, when he was \nconvicted  of  felony  possession  of  marijuana,  and  informed  by  the  State  of \n  2\n\nAlabama that his voting rights were revoked as a collateral consequence of his \nconviction.   \n7.  Hundreds of individuals from across the State of Alabama have been \nidentified to Plaintiffs’ counsel by the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles \n(“Board of Pardons” or “Board of Pardons and Paroles”), pursuant to The Public \nWritings Act of the State of Alabama, Ala. Code. § 36-12-40 et seq., as Alabama \ncitizens whose only felony convictions did not involve moral turpitude and who \nare presently eligible to register to vote.  \nDEFENDANTS \n8.   NANCY  WORLEY  is  the  Secretary  of  State  of  Alabama \n(“Secretary of State”), and, as such, is vested with the authority, as Alabama’s \n“Chief Election Official,” to execute and enforce the state laws related to the \nelective franchise to preserve public confidence in the democratic process and to \nfacilitate voter participation in elections.  She is sued in her official capacity in \nconnection with actions taken under color of state law, including the promulgation \nof  procedures  for  and  the  receipt  and  administration  of  applications  for  voter \nregistration.  See Ala. Code. § 17-4-136. \n9.  NELL HUNTER is the Jefferson County Voter Registrar (“Jefferson \nCounty Registrar”), and, as such, is vested with the authority to grant or refuse an \nindividual’s application to register to vote in Jefferson County in accordance with \nthe directives of the Secretary of State.  She is sued in her official capacity in \nconnection with actions taken under color of state law, including the refusal by her \noffice of the voter registration application of Plaintiff Gooden on September 21, \n2005. \n  3\n\n10.  ANITA GIBSON, WALTER LONG, and MOLLY MEADOWS \nare the Houston County Voter Registrars (“Houston County Registrars”), and, as \nsuch, are vested with the authority to grant or refuse an individual’s application to \nregister  to  vote  in  Houston  County  in  accordance  with  the  directives  of  the \nSecretary of State.  Each is sued in his or her official capacity in connection with \nactions taken under color of state law, including the actions (or failure to act) by \ntheir office regarding the voter registration application of Plaintiff Doss. \nJURISDICTION \n11.  Jurisdiction is based upon 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and upon 28 U.S.C.   § \n1343a(3) & (4) for causes of action arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1973c.  Jurisdiction \nfor Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief is based upon 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 & \n2202.    Jurisdiction  for  Plaintiffs’  claims  for  attorneys’  fees  is  based  upon  42 \nU.S.C. § 1973l(e) & 1988.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § \n1391(b). \nRELEVANT STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL                    \nPROVISIONS AND CASES \n12.   The Alabama Constitution, Article VIII, Section 177 (Recompiled, \nJuly 28, 1995), provides in pertinent part: \n(a) Every citizen of the United States who has attained the age \nof eighteen years and has resided in this state and in a county \nthereof for the time provided by law, if registered as provided \nby law, shall have the right to vote in the county of his or her \nresidence.  The  Legislature  may  prescribe  reasonable  and \nnondiscriminatory  requirements  as  prerequisites  to \nregistration  for  voting.  The  Legislature  shall,  by  statute, \nprescribe a procedure by which eligible citizens can register \nto vote. \n  4\n\n(b)  No  person  convicted  of  a  felony  involving  moral \nturpitude, or who is mentally incompetent, shall be qualified \nto vote until restoration of civil and political rights or removal \nof disability.  (emphasis added). \n13.  The term “felony involving moral turpitude” has been defined  by \nAlabama courts.   \n14.  Moore v. State, 12 Ala. App. 243, 250, 67 So. 789 (1915), contains \nan early definition of crimes of “moral turpitude”:  \nA  felony  of  moral  turpitude  is  defined  in  Alabama  as \n“anything done contrary to justice, honesty, principle, or good \nmorals;  an  act  of  baseness,  vileness,  or  depravity  in  the \nprivate and social duties which a man owes to his fellow man, \nor  to  society  in  general,  contrary  to  the  accepted  and \ncustomary rule of right and duty between man and man.” \n15.  In Williams v. State, 55 Ala. App. 436, 437, 316 So.2d 362, 363 \n(Ala. Cr. App. 1975), the court stated: \nA  better  summary  of  the  meaning  of  moral  turpitude  can \nhardly be given than that found in McElroy, Law of Evidence \nin Alabama, Vol. I, s 145.01(7) as follows:  \nMoral  turpitude  signifies  an  inherent  quality  of  baseness, \nvileness, depravity.  Gillman v. State, 165 Ala. 135, 51 So. \n722.    Moral  turpitude  “implies  something  immoral  itself, \nregardless of the fact whether it is punishable by law.  The \ndoing of the act, and not its prohibition by statute fixes the \nmoral turpitude.”  Pippin v. State, 197 Ala 613, 73 So. 340. \nMoral turpitude means ‘something immoral in itself.  * * * It \nmust not be merely mala prohibita, but the act itself must be \ninherently immoral.  The doing of the act itself and not its \nprohibition by statute, fixes the moral turpitude.  * * * It is the \nnature of the act itself, and not its legislative characterization \nor punishment which must be the test in determining whether \nor not it involves moral turpitude.  Ex Parte Marshall, 207 \nAla 566, 93 So. 451 (471). \n  5\n\n16.  In  Ex  Parte  McIntosh,  443  So.2d  1283,  1284  (Ala.  1983),  the \nAlabama  Supreme  Court  favorably  cited  C.  Gamble,  McElroy’s  Alabama \nEvidence, § 145.01(7) (3d ed. 1977):  \nThe Supreme Court of Alabama has defined the term “moral \nturpitude” on many occasions and the following are the most \ncommonly  found  definitions.    Moral  turpitude  signifies  an \ninherent quality of baseness, vileness and depravity.  It is \nimmoral in itself, regardless of the fact that it is punished by \nlaw.  Therefore, an offense for conviction of which a witness’ \ncredibility  is  lessened  must  be  mala  in  se  and  not  mala \nprohibitum. \n17.  Ala. Code § 17-3-9 provides:   \nAny person possessing the qualifications of an elector set out \nin Article 8 of the Constitution of Alabama, as modified by \nfederal law, and not laboring under any disqualification listed \ntherein, shall be an elector, and shall be entitled to register \nand to vote at any election by the people. \n18.  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1973c, provides in relevant part: \nWhenever a State . . . shall enact or seek to administer any voting \nqualification  or  prerequisite  to  voting,  or  standard,  practice,  or \nprocedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on \nNovember 1, 1972, such State or subdivision may institute an action in \nthe  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia  for  a \ndeclaratory  judgment  that  such  qualification,  prerequisite,  standard, \npractice, or procedure does not have the purpose and will not have the \neffect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or \ncolor,  or  in  contravention  of  the  guarantees  set  forth  in  section \n1973b(f)(2)  of  this  title,  and  unless  and  until  the  court  enters  such \njudgment  no  person  shall  be  denied  the  right  to  vote  for  failure  to \ncomply  with  such  qualification,  prerequisite,  standard,  practice,  or \nprocedure:  Provided, That such qualification, prerequisite, standard, \npractice, or procedure may be enforced without such proceeding if the \nqualification,  prerequisite,  standard,  practice,  or  procedure  has  been \nsubmitted by the chief legal officer or other appropriate official of such \nState or subdivision to the Attorney General and the Attorney General \n  6\n\nhas not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, \nor upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval within \nsixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively \nindicated that such objection will not be made. \nFACTS \n19.  From Reconstruction until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of \n1965,  Alabama  employed  virtually  every  state  instrument  of  disfranchisement \navailable to suppress the Black vote, including terror and violence, literacy tests, \npoll taxes, a “grandfather clause,” good character tests, and white-only primaries.  \nAs a result, only 19 percent of the Black voting-age population in Alabama was \nregistered to vote in 1964, one of the lowest proportions in the South.  By contrast, \n69 percent of the white voting-age population was registered at that time.   \n20.  As a result of its long history of discrimination against Blacks in \nvoting, the entire State of Alabama is covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights \nAct  of  1965  pursuant  to  Section  4  of  that  statute  and  the  designation  by  the \nAttorney General.   \n21.  Following the 1982 renewal of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965, the Supreme Court recognized in Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 \n(1985), that Alabama, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, impermissibly used its felon disfranchisement law to intentionally \ndisfranchise Blacks and to maintain and reinforce white supremacy.    \n22.  In 1995-1996, the Alabama Legislature proposed, and the people \nratified, Act 95-443 of the 1995 Regular Session of the Legislature of Alabama, \nwhich  proposed  a  constitutional  amendment  to  repeal  Article  VIII  of  the \nConstitution of Alabama of 1901 regarding voting, and replace it with Section 177 \n(the text of which is set out above). \n  7\n\n23.  Pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the State \nof Alabama, on April 16, 1996, submitted Act No. 95-443 to the Attorney General \nof the United States for preclearance.   \n24.  In a June 24, 1996 letter to Lynda Oswald, Alabama Assistant \nAttorney General, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights pursuant to Section \n5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, interposed no objection to (“precleared”) \nAlabama’s revised voting law.   \n25.  In  the  2003  Second  Special  Session,  the  Alabama  Legislature \nadopted  Act  2003-415,  codified  at  Ala.  Code  §  15-22-36.1,  a  law  requiring \nmembers of the Board of Pardons to provide a procedure for the restoration of \nvoting  rights  —  by  issuing  a  Certificate  of  Eligibility  to  Register  to  Vote \n(“Certificate  of  Eligibility”)  —  to  individuals  with  felony  convictions  who \nsatisfactorily complete each of the terms and conditions of their sentences. \n26.  On information and belief, in the course of attempting to discharge \nits statutory duties the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles determined that \nthere  was  public  confusion  about  the  scope  of  the  State  of  Alabama’s  felon \ndisfranchisement law, and/or that agents of the State, including the Secretary of \nState  and  Defendant  Registrars,  were  misapplying  Alabama’s  law,  thereby \ncreating confusion and depriving eligible citizens of their right to register to vote \nand exercise the franchise. \n27.  To  facilitate  compliance  with  Ala.  Code  §  15-22-36.1,  and  to \ndetermine which felonies require the issuance of a Certificate of Eligibility as a \nprerequisite  to  registering  to  vote,  William  Segrest,  Executive  Director  of  the \nBoard of Pardons and Paroles, requested that Troy King, Attorney General for the \n  8\n\nState of Alabama, set forth which felonies do not involve moral turpitude under \nState law.  \n28.  In response to Segrest’s request, the Attorney General issued an \nOpinion which explained that “[i]f a person has been convicted of a felony that \ndoes  not  involve  moral  turpitude,  that  person  remains  eligible  to  vote  and  is \ntherefore  ineligible  to  apply  [to  the  Board  of  Pardons]  for  a  Certificate  of \nEligibility to Register to Vote.”  See Ala. Op. Atty. Gen. No. 2005-092 (March 18, \n2005), 2005 WL 1121853 (Ala. A.G.).     \n29.  In  the  Opinion,  the  Attorney  General  did  not  “provide  an \nexhaustive list of every felony involving moral turpitude,” but listed a number of \nillustrative crimes that have been determined by Alabama courts not to involve \nmoral  turpitude,  including  “violation  of  liquor  laws”  and  “driving  under  the \ninfluence.”  Id. at 2 (citing Parker v. State, 280 Ala. 685, 198 So. 2d 261 (1967); \nFinley v. State, 661 So. 2d 1321 (Ala. Crim. App. 1995)).  Thus, if “a person is \nconvicted solely of a felony that does not involve moral turpitude, that person \nremains eligible to vote.”  Id. at 3.   \n30.  Following the Attorney General’s Opinion, the Board of Pardons \nand Paroles issued a press release on May 17, 2005 to inform the public and \nclarify the operation of Alabama’s felon disfranchisement law.   \n31.  The May 17th press release noted that as the Board of Pardons \nattempted to implement Ala. Code § 15-22-36.1 it “discovered that many eligible \nvoters [were] unaware” that they did not need a “certificate from this agency in \norder to register to vote.”  “Under the current law only felonies involving moral \nturpitude disqualify a person from voting.  Convictions for other felonies do not \n  9\n\ndisqualify a person from voting.  If individuals who are already eligible to vote do \nnot ask us for certificates, we can process the other applications more promptly.”  \nThe press release stated unequivocally, inter alia, that “felony driving under the \ninfluence” and “felony possession of drugs” are offenses that do not involve moral \nturpitude.   \n32.  On  information  and  belief,  notwithstanding  the  dictates  of \nAlabama law, which reflect the express ratification of the people of Alabama, the \naforementioned Attorney General’s Opinion, and the press release that was issued \nby the Board of Pardons and Paroles, within the last six months in the following \ntwenty counties, registrars were directed by the Secretary of State not to register \npeople with any felony conviction — whether or not the felony involved moral \nturpitude  —  without  a  Certificate  of  Eligibility:    Bullock,  Chilton,  Choctaw, \nDallas,  Escambia,  Greene,  Houston,  Jefferson,  Lowndes,  Macon,  Madison, \nMarengo, Mobile, Montgomery, Pike, Randolph, St. Clair, Talladega, Tallapoosa \nand Tuscaloosa.  \n33.  Registrars  throughout  Alabama,  under  the  direction  of  the \nSecretary of State, are employing practices and procedures that are inconsistent \nwith a Section 5 precleared Alabama law and have not themselves been submitted \nfor preclearance, in violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.   \n34.  The effect of these practices is to deny the vote to eligible citizens \nof Alabama. \n35.  The  constitutional  amendment  that  was  duly  enacted  and \nprecleared pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act on June 24, 1996 is the \nlaw of Alabama with respect to felon disfranchisement in the State and constitutes \n  10\n\nthe benchmark for Section 5 purposes.  Any voting practice or procedure that \ncontradicts, enlarges or frustrates this law constitutes a voting change within the \nmeaning of the Voting Rights Act that must be precleared pursuant to Section 5 \nbefore it may legally take effect. \nAlabama’s Denial of the Franchise to Plaintiff Gooden \n36.  On September 21, 2005 Plaintiff Gooden attempted to register with \nDefendant Jefferson County Registrar, but was informed that he was “not eligible” \nto register to vote because of his felony DUI conviction.   \n37.  Notwithstanding the ratification — by the people of Alabama — of \nthe  constitutional  amendment  narrowing  the  scope  of  the  State’s  felon \ndisfranchisement law to felons who have committed crimes of moral turpitude, the \nAttorney General’s Opinion, and the press release issued by the Board of Pardons, \nPlaintiff Gooden was instructed by Defendant Jefferson County Registrar to apply \nto the Board of Pardons and Paroles for a Certificate of Eligibility. \n38.  Plaintiff Gooden was informed later that day by an employee of the \nBoard of Pardons and Paroles that because his felony DUI conviction did not \ninvolve moral turpitude, consistent with Alabama law and the related Attorney \nGeneral’s Opinion, he need not apply for a Certificate of Eligibility since their \nvoting rights were never forfeited.   \n39.  Upon information and belief, an employee of the Board of Pardons \ntelephoned Defendant Jefferson County Registrar on September 21, 2005, and \nexplained that Plaintiff Gooden was not disqualified from voting since his felony \nconviction did not involve moral turpitude, and, therefore, that a Certificate of \nEligibility was not necessary for him to register to vote.   \n  11\n\n40.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  employee  of  the  Board  of \nPardons also offered to fax Defendant Jefferson County Registrar a copy of the \npress release the Board of Pardons had issued to this effect.  \n41.  Upon information and belief, notwithstanding its recognition that \nPlaintiff Gooden’s felony DUI conviction did not involve moral turpitude, and \nthat, in fact, his conviction was expressly identified under Alabama law and in the \nAttorney  General’s  Opinion  as  non-disqualifying  crime,  Defendant  Jefferson \nCounty Registrar informed the Board of Pardons that the Defendant Secretary of \nState had directed them not to register individuals with felony convictions who \nhad not obtained a Certificate of Eligibility, without regard to whether or not such \nfelony convictions involved moral turpitude.  \n42.  Efforts  to  resolve  this  issue  with  the  Secretary  of  State,  as  to \nPlaintiff Gooden and all similarly situated Alabamians, have been unsuccessful, \nand the Secretary of State continues to enforce voting practices and procedures \nthat have not been precleared as required by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, which result in the deprivation of the right to vote.   \nAlabama’s Denial of the Franchise to Plaintiff Jones \n43.  In a June 20, 2005 letter to Plaintiff Jones, the Board of Pardons \nexplained that after reviewing his “application for a Certificate of Eligibility to \nRegister to Vote, we have determined that you were convicted of possession of a \ncontrolled substance,” which is a felony “that does not appear to this agency to \ninvolve moral turpitude.”  The Board of Pardons determined that, according to \nAmendment 579 of the Alabama Constitution, Mr. Jones’ “conviction does not \ndisqualify [him] from voting.”  The Board of Pardons, therefore, asserted that “we \n  12\n\nare closing our file on your application, as you do not need a certificate in order to \nbe eligible to register.”   \n44.  Plaintiff Jones, after receiving the June 20, 2005 letter from the \nBoard of Pardons, submitted a Voter Registration Form to Defendant Jefferson \nCounty Registrar.   \n45.  Notwithstanding the Board of Pardon’s June 20, 2005 letter to the \ncontrary,  Defendant  Jefferson  County  Registrar,  in  a  June  30,  2005  letter  to \nPlaintiff Jones, stated that his Voter Registration Form could not be processed \nbecause “a person convicted of a felony offense is barred from voting, unless there \nhas been a reinstatement of voting rights.”   \n46.  Defendant Jefferson County Registrar referred Plaintiff Jones to \nthe Board of Pardons to “get [his] voting rights restored.”  “If you have already \ndone this,” the letter concluded, “mail a copy of your Certificate of Pardon or \nCertificate  of  Registration  of  Voter  Rights  to  the  Jefferson  County  Board  of \nRegistrars.”   \n47.  Inexplicably, Plaintiff Jones was later mailed a Voter Registration \nCard, which permitted him to vote in “all elections — except municipal.”   \nAlabama’s Denial of the Franchise to Plaintiff Doss \n48.  On or about October 5, 2005, Plaintiff Doss attempted to register to \nvote with Defendant Houston County Registrar, but was informed that he was \nineligible  to  register  to  vote  because  of  his  felony  possession  of  marijuana \nconviction.   \n49.  Notwithstanding  Defendant  Houston  County  Registrar’s \nrecognition that Plaintiff Doss’s felony conviction did not involve moral turpitude, \n  13\n\nand that, in fact, his conviction was expressly identified in Alabama law and the \nAttorney  General’s  Opinion  as  a  non-disqualifying  crime,  Defendant  Houston \nCounty Registrar informed Plaintiff Doss that the Defendant Secretary of State \nhad directed them not to register individuals with felony convictions who had not \nobtained a Certificate of Eligibility, without regard to whether or not such felony \nconvictions involved moral turpitude. \n50.  Plaintiff  Doss  was  instructed  by  Defendant  Houston  County \nRegistrar to apply to the Board of Pardons for a Certificate of Eligibility. \nEffect of Statewide Practices \n51.  Upon information and belief, a substantial but unspecified number \nof similarly situated citizens of Alabama are being denied the right to vote as \nresult of the conduct described above on the part of the Secretary of State and \nRegistrars. \n52.  The practices of the Secretary of State and Registrars described \nabove are contrary to precleared practices and procedures affecting voting that are \nrequired to be, but have not been, submitted to the Attorney General of the United \nStates of a District Court in the District of Columbia for preclearance.    \n \nCAUSE OF ACTION \n53.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs \n1 through 52 above.  \n54.  Defendant  Secretary  of  State  and  Defendant  Registrars  have \nviolated Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § \n  14\n\n1973c,  by  administering  voting  practices  and  procedures  that  have  not  been \nprecleared pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.   \n55.  Specifically, Defendant Secretary of State, upon information and \nbelief, directed Jefferson County Registrar, Houston County Registrars, and voter \nregistrars in at least 18 other counties in Alabama, not to register people with \nfelony convictions irrespective of whether or not such convictions involved moral \nturpitude, in violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   \n56.  This misrepresentation by the Secretary of State of the right of \ncertain persons to register to vote has caused State Registrars in at least twenty \ncounties to refuse to register eligible persons in the State of Alabama.   \n57.  Plaintiffs are without an adequate remedy at law and will suffer \nirreparable damage unless the actions of the Defendants in violation of the Section \n5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are enjoined.   \n58.  The gravity of the rights deprivation that would flow to Plaintiffs \nand other similarly situated individuals from resolving these critical issues on \nDefendant Secretary of State’s timetable necessitates immediate action.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  THE  PREMISES  CONSIDERED,  the  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that the following relief be granted: \n59.  Plaintiffs request that their Section 5 enforcement claims be heard \nand determined by a court of three judges in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 1973c \nand the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2284. \n60.  Plaintiffs request that the Court enter a declaratory judgment that \nDefendant Secretary of State and Defendant Registrars’ actions violate Plaintiffs \n  15\n\nrights secured by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Plaintiffs request \nthat this Court enter a declaratory judgment that Defendant Secretary of State and \nDefendant  Registrars  lack  the  authority,  unless  and  until  Defendants  obtain \npreclearance for such practices and procedures after submitting those practices and \nprocedures for preclearance, as required by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, to \npreclude  individuals  convicted  of  felonies  not  involving  moral  turpitude  from \nregistering to vote and voting under Alabama law. \n61.  Plaintiffs request the award of reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses, \nand costs under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973l(e) and 1988. \n62.  Plaintiffs request such other, further, and different relief as the \nfacts and circumstances may warrant. \n  16\n\n \nDated:    Birmingham, Alabama \n    December 19, 2005 \n \nTheodore M.
