    "summary": "<p>Plaintiffs, a group of federal prisoners housed in a highly restrictive setting and represented by private counsel from the Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance's Marion Prisoners' Rights Project, the ACLU and the New Hampshire Legal Assistance, sued federal Bureau of Prisons officials in 1974, filing their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois.  The complaint sought class action status for all present and future prisoners housed in the Marion Federal Penitentiary's Control Unit (CU).  The complaint led to a bench trial before District Judge James Foreman.  His subsequent April 19, 1978, order made numerous findings as to the plaintiffs' claims that the CU, as administered, violated their Fifth Amendment due process rights and their Eighth Amendment rights to be free of cruel and unusual punishment.</p><p>Judge Foreman determined that the defendants' usage of the CU as a preventative measure did not violate plaintiffs' substantive due process rights but, when used as punishment, the lack of an adequate procedure to assess CU usage violated these rights.  Used as a preventative measure, however, the CU did not violate the Eighth Amendment, as it was not punitive in purpose.  The court did find that procedural due process protections were lacking and prescribed that the BOP provide the following:  written notice to the prisoner of the claimed act(s) meriting the CU housing for preventive purposes;  a personal hearing for the prisoner before an impartial decision-maker allowing for prisoner presentation of documents, witnesses and his explanation in opposition to CU placement;  advising the prisoner of the information against him, if doing so can occur without harm to others (witness confrontation rights were not required, however);  written, non-boilerplate reasons for a decision that CU placement is appropriate; a review process for the initial CU classification decision, as well as periodic reviews of whether CU housing remains warranted;  and advice to prisoners of what they may do to achieve release from CU status.  The judge found that cruel and unusual punishment was imposed by the CU program's use of closed-front \"boxcar\" cells in which prisoners were confined for all but a half-hour per day, without reading material, rehabilitative programs or other stimulus.  He banned the BOP from continued, nonconsensual use of such cells and required the BOP to submit proposals to expand exercise opportunities.  Judge Foreman rejected the claim that non-contact limits on visitation privileges violated the Eighth Amendment.  Bono v. Saxbe, 450 F. Supp. 954 (E.D. IL. 1979).  </p><p>Judge Forman's April ruling was followed by another order, reported as Bono v. Saxbe, 462 F. Supp. 146 (E.D. IL. 1978), which reviewed proposals for change that the defendant had submitted, the plaintiffs' objections to those proposals, and the defendant's request for reconsideration of a limitation imposed on the use of a prisoner's prior escape attempts when determining whether CU placement was warranted.  Judge Foreman refused to require the decisionmaker on CU placement to be someone unconnected with the BOP.  He reaffirmed his earlier ruling that an indefinite stay in the CU is constitutional, provided guidelines guide officials' discretion and, in an appendix, set out guidelines for CU referral and review.  Regarding out-of-cell exercise, the court ruled that seven hours per week of such exercise was required and that limiting groups of prisoners to two for such exercise sufficed.  The seven hours were to be calculated independently of any non-exercise time a prisoner spent outside his cell.  Reconsidering, the judge accepted the defendant's argument that BOP officials may consider escape attempts when determining whether a prisoner should be assigned to the CU.</p><p>The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  On April 14, 1980, that court upheld much of the district court's rulings.   Because the prisoners had only a limited liberty interest in remaining in the prison's general population, given their status as convicted prisoners, the appellate court agreed that only a rational basis (rather than a compelling state interest) need be shown by the government to justify CU placement.  It found adequate the procedural protections ordered by the district court.  The Seventh Circuit remanded the case for further review by the district court of whether a reasonable relationship existed between certain conditions of confinement (e.g., visual strip searches for prisoners following non-contact visits, poor cell lighting) and the stated need of institutional security.  Bono v. Saxbe, 620 F.2d 609 (7th Cir. 1980) (Circuit Judge Richard D. Cudahy).  Circuit Judge Harrington Wood, Jr., dissented in part, opining that the remand invited unwarranted meddling in prison administration.  Id.</p><p>On remand, Judge Foreman considered the adequacy of lighting in the CU housing and the strip search practices preceding and following non-contact visits to CU-housed prisoners.  Noting that he had actually visited the cells used for the CU, the judge's December 24, 1980, ruling found that the lighting issue was resolved by the defendant's offer to provide a 40, 60, or 100 watt light bulb to each CU resident, to meet their preference. Next, Judge Foreman ruled that the record made on remand justified the visual strip searches of inmates before and after non-contact visits.  The record showed past discovery of contraband, opportunities for smuggling despite the non-contact nature of the visits, and limited ability by the BOP to monitor visits.  In these circumstances, neither due process nor the Fourth Amendment were violated by the searches, according to the court.  Bono v. Saxbe, 527  F.Supp. 1182 (S.D. Ill. 1980).  (The name of the relevant judicial district had changed from \"Eastern\" to \"Southern\" following a 1979 realignment.)</p><p>We have no further information about this case</p><p></p>",

Illinois.\nDecember 24, 1980.\nJames R. Burgess, Jr., U. S. Atty., S. D. Ill., E. St. Louis, Ill., for defendants.\nNew Hampshire Legal Assistance, Concord, N. H., Howard Eglit, American Civil Liberties Union, Dennis\nCunningham and Michael Deutsch, Chicago, Ill., David Johnson, Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance, Marion\nPrisoners' Rights Project, Carbondale, Ill., for plaintiffs.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nFOREMAN, Chief Judge:\nThis matter is before the Court on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in \nBono v. Saxbe, 620 F.2d 609 (7th Cir. 1980). Proceedings in this Court prior to appeal are recorded at 450\n[1]\nF.Supp. 934 (E.D.Ill.1978) and 462 F.Supp. 146 (E.D.Ill.1978).  As the Court of Appeals stated in its order, \"[w]e\naffirm with respect to most of the matters treated in the District Court's two opinions but remand for further\nproceedings involving two matters as set forth herein.\" 620 F.2d at 611 (emphasis added). Those two matters\nconcern strip searches of Control Unit (or H-Unit) inmates before and after non-contact visits with family and\nfriends, and the adequacy of lighting in the H-Unit cells. This Court was ordered to hear evidence and make a\n1183 determination whether *1183 these two conditions imposed upon inmates in H-Unit are reasonably related to the\nneed for institutional security at the United States Penitentiary, Marion, Illinois, and thus comport with the\nmandate of substantive due process. At the opening of the proceedings, plaintiffs' counsel urged upon this Court\nthat the Court of Appeals' opinion was intended to open the issues on remand beyond the two specifically\nmentioned. Plaintiffs' Motion for Additional Relief on Remand is currently pending in this matter. The Court cannot\naccept plaintiffs' interpretation of the order of the Court of Appeals and hereby DENIES plaintiffs' motion. The\nopening language of the appellate opinion is clear that the scope of the remand is restricted to two matters. Thus,\nthe Court will proceed to those two issues.\nA. Lighting in H-Unit Cells.\nAt the hearing held in this matter on November 3 and 4, 1980, inside Marion Penitentiary, plaintiffs argued that\nthis Court should categorically order that every cell in H-Unit be equipped with a 100 watt light bulb so that\ninmates may see better in their cells. Prison officials offered uncontradicted testimony that inmates complain\noften that the naked light bulbs of even lesser wattage in their cells are too bright. The Court actually visited in H-\nUnit and observed makeshift devices inmates had devised to diffuse and filter the bright light. It appears to the\nCourt that the matter is better settled by the prison officials' offer to furnish either a 40, 60 or 100 watt light bulb\nupon request of an individual inmate. In this case, service of individual preference undercuts the constitutional\ndimension of the complaint. Thus, the prison officials should develop a reasonable procedure for giving to an\ninmate either a 40, 60 or 100 watt light bulb for his cell immediately.\n\nB. Visual Body (Strip) Searches.\nThe Court of Appeals was particularly concerned with strip searches of inmates before and after non-contact\nvisits with family and friends. The Court of Appeals did not believe that the rationale announced in Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) justified the strip searches. Addressing this issue, the Court\nstated:\nThe Supreme Court in Wolfish relied on the possibility of contraband being brought into the prison\nduring contact visits to justify the use of strip searches. Those contact visits were not closely\nsupervised by guards. Wolfish should not be extended to the facts of this case without a showing\nthat there is some risk that contraband will be smuggled into Marion during non-contact\nsupervised visits, or that some other risk within the prison will be presented.\nBono, 620 F.2d at 617. The Court of Appeals also expressed concern in a footnote that the evidence in the\nproceeding below indicated that strip searches are not required in connection with inmates' contact visits with\ntheir counsel, but are required when they visit family and friends. Bono v. Saxbe, 450 F.Supp. 934, 939\n(E.D.Ill.1978) (Findings of Fact Nos. 40 and 41). With the issue before the Court so framed, and based on the\nhearings at Marion November 3 and 4, 1980, and the personal inspection of the visiting area and H-Unit by the\nCourt at that time, the following findings of fact are made.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. An H-Unit inmate must submit to a visual body search, commonly referred to as a strip search, each time he\nleaves H-Unit for a visit.\n2. An H-Unit inmate must submit to a strip search whether his visit is a non-contact visit with family or friends or a\ncontact visit with an attorney.\n3. Upon completion of either a non-contact or contact visit, each H-Unit inmate must submit to another strip\nsearch, which in most instances, is administered by correctional officers in an area adjacent to the visiting room\narea.\n4. A strip search consists of an inmate removing all of his clothing, whereupon the correctional officer inspects the\n1184 inmate's *1184 body orifices for contraband. An inmate must lift his genitals and bend over to spread his buttocks\nfor visual inspection. The inmate is not touched, except for an occasional situation where an inmate's hair style\nrequires an officer to run his hands through the hair of the inmate to insure that no contraband is being secreted.\n5. During non-contact visits, H-Unit inmates use \"controlled visiting booths\" in which the inmate is separated by a\nplexiglass partition from his visitor. The inmate and the visitor speak through a telephone.\n6. The same \"controlled visiting booths\" are used by open population inmates, segregation inmates, and H-Unit\ninmates.\n7. The ceiling of the controlled visiting booth in which the inmate is seated during non-contact visits is made of\nwire mesh which is not impenetrable and which could allow for limited contact with the adjoining booth.\n8. There is no constant or direct supervision by correctional officers of inmates seated in the individual controlled\nvisiting booths. The guard on duty cannot see into all the booths at once.\n9. On at least one occasion, the plexiglass partition has been compromised by means of burning a hole in the\npartition.\n10. Articles of contraband, including homemade weapons and homemade handcuff keys, have been found in the\ncells of inmates housed in H-Unit, as well as on the inmates of H-Unit themselves.\n\n11. A cursory search of the controlled visiting booth is conducted by a correctional officer before an inmate enters\nto visit. Regular maintenance of these booths is performed during non-visiting hours by inmate orderlies.\n12. Prisoners testified at the hearing as to taunting and baiting which occasionally accompanies the strip\nsearches.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nThe Court has no doubt that visual body searches may invade personal privacy and may be a humiliating\nexperience for the inmate, but these practices must be viewed in connection with the realities of prison life in\ngeneral and Marion, in particular. The Court must decide whether the strip searches, both before and after non-\ncontact visits, are reasonably related to the dictates of institutional security.\nPlaintiffs contend that there is no need for a strip search before or after the non-contact visit in that the purpose of\nthe strip searches, especially the second search, is to harass, humiliate and subjugate the inmates. Relying on\nthe testimony of H-Unit inmates, plaintiffs argue that the \"demeaning remarks, the sexually perverted taunting\nand baiting which frequently accompany the searches, together with the frequent harassment of the visitors, is\nonly another aspect of the Control Unit regimen, and the anti-human philosophy which informs its operation.\"\n(Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 3.) Defendants, on the other\nhand, while acknowledging that strip searches may invade personal privacy and be humiliating to the inmate,\nargue that the security needs of the United States Penitentiary at Marion outweigh the privacy of the inmates, and\nthat the strip searches, before and after visitation, are rationally related to security needs. The Court agrees with\ndefendants.\nAlthough body searches may violate the Fourth Amendment, Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 147, 45 S.Ct.\n280, 283, 60 L.Ed. 543 (1925), the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 521, 99 S.Ct. 1864 (1979),\nsanctioned visual body searches in contact visit situations when the practice meets the test of reasonableness.\nOther courts have condoned strip searches. See, e.g., Daughtery v. Harris, 476 F.2d 292 (10th Cir.),cert. denied,\n414 U.S. 872, 94 S.Ct. 112, 38 L.Ed.2d 91 (1973); Hodges v. Klein, 412 F.Supp. 986 (D.N.J.1976). The test\nenunciated in Bell is clearly applicable to the present case. Although Bell dealt with contact visits and the instant\nmatter concerns non-contact visits, the \"reasonableness\" test encompasses that difference and only requires a\nstronger showing of justification.\n1185 *1185 The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise\ndefinition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the\nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must\nconsider the scope of the particular invasion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification\nfor initiating it and the place in which it is conducted.\n[2]\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.  Applying this test, the strip searches, before and after non-\ncontact visits, emerge as constitutionally permissible.\nThe search itself is a visual search with no actual intrusion into the body cavities by correctional officers. An\ninmate is not touched except in special circumstances. The first search takes place after the inmate leaves his\ncell and the second takes place in a room adjacent to the visiting rooms. The first is designed to prevent inmates\nfrom entering the visiting area with contraband and the second is to insure that when the inmate returns to H-\nUnit, he is without contraband. Thus, the place and manner of the searches seem well calculated to achieve the\ndesired end.\nProbably the most crucial factor concerns justification. The Court is of the opinion that both searches are justified\nby the need to maintain security and prevent injury to guards and other inmates. It is clear that the first strip\nsearch is justified. First, both the former and the present Control Unit managers offered unrebutted testimony that\nthe possession of contraband, including but not limited to homemade knives and homemade handcuff keys, must\nbe prevented in order to protect both the staff and the inmates of H-Unit. Numerous items of contraband have\n\nbeen found in H-Unit cells and on the persons of the inmates housed there. Moreover, the types of inmates who\ntestified were characteristic of H-Unit inmates against whom the tight security measure is aimed. One inmate\nwitness had been found guilty by the Institution Disciplinary Committee of shooting at other inmates on two\noccasions. Another had been found guilty by the IDC of three separate escape attempts. This Court takes judicial\nnotice of many criminal trials heard before it, in which H-Unit inmates were accused of acts of violence involving\nweapons. See, e.g., United States v. Van Burkett, Crim.No. 80-40026 (S.D.Ill. Aug. 22, 1980); United States v.\nGreschner, Crim.No. 80-40021 (S.D.Ill. May 29, 1980); United States v. Garcia, Crim.No. 77-05071-01-E (E.D.Ill.\nDec. 14, 1977).\nIt is not unreasonable that prison officials believe that contraband may be used to compromise the security of the\nprison before a visit.\nGreater attention should be focused on the second strip search which occurs after the non-contact visit. This\nCourt actually stood inside one of the controlled visiting booths and observed the layout of the visiting room area,\nincluding the adjacent room where the second strip search is carried out. After this personal investigation and\nreview of the testimony taken at the hearing, the Court is satisfied that the second strip search is reasonably\nrelated to the valid security goals of the prison. Testimony indicated that maintenance of the booths during\nnonvisiting hours is handled by inmate orderlies and that the same booths are used by inmates in open\npopulation, segregation and H-Unit. It is possible that inmate orderlies or prisoners from general population could\nsecrete contraband in a hidden part of the booth or chair, which could be taken by an H-Unit inmate back to his\ncell after a non-contact visit. As testimony indicated, the prison guard supervising visitation cannot possibly\n1186 observe all inmates in the booths at the same time, and the search *1186 made by the correctional officer after a\nvisit is necessarily short and non-thorough. Thus, there would be an opportunity for an inmate to so obtain\ncontraband. In addition, it is possible that an H-Unit inmate could compromise the wire mesh ceiling of the\ncontrolled visiting booth and pass this contraband to another inmate. Indeed, when the Court inspected the\nbooths, the wire mesh of one of the booths was loose enough to permit limited access to the other booth. Finally,\nthe Court observed that in one situation the plexiglass partition in the booth had been compromised and a small\nhole burned in it.\nWhile the result the Court has reached on the permissibility of the second strip search is by no means clearly\nwarranted, it is clear that proper deference must be given to the informed discretion of the prison officials who are\nbest qualified to make a determination whether certain conduct or conditions \"possess the likelihood of disruption\nto prison order or stability, or otherwise interfere with legitimate penological objectives of the prison environment.\"\nJones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union, 433 U.S. 119, 133, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 2541, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1976).\nCertainly security is a paramount penological objective. The fact that prison officials cannot point to numerous\ninstances where security has been compromised is not dispositive. A reasonable belief that a breach of security\ncan occur is proof enough. Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974). As\nwas stated in Bell v. Wolfish, supra, the fact that few such instances occur \"may be more a testament to the\neffectiveness of this search technique as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmates to\nsecrete and import such items when the opportunity arises.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85.\nThis Court is satisfied that the beliefs of prison officials are reasonable, and that the strip searches are justified as\nvalid security measures.\nThere was some testimony by prisoners that the strip searches are accompanied by taunting and harassment by\nthe prison guards. The Court is not persuaded that the means to prevent this problem is by compromising the\nsecurity of the institution. Rather, the Court expresses here its disapproval of such conduct and hereby conditions\nthe use of strip searches upon the cessation and prevention of all such harassment by prison guards in the\nfuture.\nAlso, it was suggested by plaintiffs that the Court rule that where a strip search is reasonably necessary, the\ncorrectional officer should himself bend over to accomplish the body search, rather than require the inmate to do\nso. Although the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, supra, refused to impose a least restrictive alternative\nrequirement on officials performing the searches, 441 U.S. 520, 559 n. 40, 99 S.Ct. at 1885 n. 40, the Court is\nsatisfied that current procedures are in fact the least intrusive. The method suggested by plaintiffs could well lead\nto unnecessary friction between inmate and correctional officer, and could also increase the likelihood of physical\n\ncontact during the search. One redeeming quality of the search is its visual, non-contact nature, which this Court\nis not willing to modify.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n[3]\nThe foregoing discussion leads to the following conclusions of law:\n1. The first strip search, which takes place as inmates leave the Control Unit before non-contact visitation in\ncontrolled visiting booths, is reasonably related to the valid penological goal of the maintenance of security and\nthus complies with due process and the Fourth Amendment.\n1187 *1187 2. The second strip search, which takes place in an adjacent room as inmates leave the visiting area after\nnon-contact visitation, is reasonably related to the valid penological goal of the maintenance of security and thus\ncomplies with due process and the Fourth Amendment.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] The districts in Illinois were realligned on March 31, 1979, and this Court, designated to sit in East St. Louis,\nAlton and Benton, Illinois, became part of the Southern District of Illinois.\n[2] That the test of Bell v. Wolfish is applicable here is further buttressed by the Court of Appeals' statement that \"\nWolfish should not be extended to the facts of this case without a showing that there is some risk that contraband\nwill be smuggled into Marion during non-contact, supervised visits, or that some other risk within the prison will be\npresented.\" 620 F.2d at 617. Thus, once the requisite showing has been made, the rationale of Bell v. Wolfish\napplies.\n[3] Although the Fourth Amendment was not urged on this Court by plaintiffs, nor mentioned by the Court of\nAppeals in its order, this was the limitation on government power dealt with by the Supreme Court in Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Nevertheless, the \"reasonableness\" test developed\nthere to monitor Fourth Amendment compliance is for all practical purposes identical to that envisioned by the\nCourt of Appeals in monitoring compliance with substantive due process. Thus, the searches comply with both\nthe Fourth and the Fifth Amendments.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The district court ordered some changes in the conditions and in the\n[1]\ndecision-making process, which appellants claim are insufficient.  We affirm with respect to most of the matters\ntreated in the district court's two opinions but remand for further proceedings involving two matters as set forth\nherein.\nMarion is a maximum security prison, and it is one of a small number of federal prisons which contain a Control\nUnit, in which prisoners with demonstrably proven behavior problems may be confined in order to keep them out\nof the general prison population. Prisoners may be placed in the Marion Control Unit directly from the federal\ncourts, from the general population at Marion or from other federal and state prisons.\n1. Cruel and Unusual Punishment 00 Substantive Due Process\n97\nThe Control Unit at Marion consists of seventy-two single person cells and is one of nine units in which inmates\nare housed. Prisoners are placed in the Control Unit ostensibly for \"administrative segregation,\" i. e., for\nconfinement of prisoners who would present a significant danger to the safety of other prisoners or staff or who\nwould disrupt the orderly functioning of the prison if they were left in the general population. Confinement in the\nControl Unit is not intended to be for the purpose of punishment of prisoners, although the district court noted that\nit had been used punitively on a few occasions.\nAppellants claim (1) that the decision to confine an inmate in the Control Unit is a decision to impose cruel and\nunusual punishment because prisoners were thereby punished in the absence of an alleged and proven offense\nand (2) that specific conditions in the Control Unit are so harsh as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\n(This second argument is treated in section 2, infra.) In response to argument (1), the district court stressed that\nthe decision in question involved confinement for administrative reasons, not as a means of punishing\ndefendants. Appellants argue that confinement in the Control Unit is \"punitive in essence and effect\" and that\neven if the purpose were administrative, not punitive, the protections of the Eighth Amendment would still apply.\nWe agree that the Eighth Amendment protects the inmates from undergoing cruel and unusual punishment\nwithout regard to whether such punishment is imposed for punitive or administrative reasons. But this principle\n\ndoes not prevent defendants from deciding to change the conditions of confinement for administrative reasons,\nso long as the conditions do not involve cruel and unusual punishment. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678,\n612 686-687, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 *612 (1978) and Kelly v. Brewer, 525 F.2d 394, 399-400 (8th Cir. 1975).\nThe district court correctly held that if inmates were put in the Control Unit as a punishment for an offense or for\nno reason at all, they would have to be released because such treatment would be a violation of substantive due\nprocess. The court ordered defendants to conduct hearings, complete with the procedural safeguards discussed\nin section 4, infra, to determine if each inmate in the Control Unit was there for the purported administrative\npurpose 00 to remove those with demonstrable behavior problems from the general prison population. If any\n97\nprisoners were in the Control Unit for other reasons (which would include being confined there as a punishment),\nor for no reason at all, the district court ordered that they be released.\nWe find no error in the district court's decision to require the defendants to review the reasons why each inmate\nwas put in the Control Unit. Prisoners may, if necessary, seek judicial review of defendants' decision to confine\nthem in the Control Unit by filing suit in the district court, and, if the procedures for confinement prescribed by the\ndistrict court have not been followed or valid reasons for segregation have not been found, the district court will\norder their return to the general prison population.\nIf these procedures have been followed and prisoners are found to have been confined to the Control Unit for\nvalid and administrative reasons, placing prisoners in the Control Unit does not constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment because the prisoners are not being \"punished\" for an\noffense (other than the one for which they have been convicted). It is in this context that we affirm the district\ncourt's finding that, when the Control Unit is used as a preventive measure, the decision to place a prisoner there\nis not a violation of substantive due process or of the Eighth Amendment.\n2. Cruel and Unusual Punishment 00 Specific Conditions\n97\nAs mentioned above, however, conditions of imprisonment may in fact be cruel and unusual punishment even\nthough such conditions are imposed for administrative reasons. The Supreme Court has stated that the\nconstitutional proscription of cruel and unusual punishment imposes three different kinds of limitations upon the\ntreatment of prisoners. The cruel and unusual punishment provision (1) forbids the imposition of certain types of\npunishment, (2) proscribes punishment which is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime, and (3)\nimposes some limits on what may be made criminal and punished. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667, 97\nS.Ct. 1401, 1410, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977). Appellants contend, citing the first two categories above, that the\nconditions in the Control Unit constitute cruel and unusual punishment because these conditions are in and of\nthemselves impermissible types of punishment and because these conditions constitute punishment which is not\nin proportion to the severity of the relevant offense. Appellants also claim that the conditions in the Control Unit\nare cruel and unusual punishment because they are not \"premised upon, and limited to the purposes of\n[2]\nlegitimate penological principles or objectives.\"  While we question whether this third objection may be\n[3]\nsuccessfully derived from the existing case law,  we are not persuaded that the conditions in the Control Unit,\nas modified by the district court, are cruel and unusual punishment under any one of the three analyses\nsuggested.\n613 *613 Prior to the district court's order, prisoners in the Control Unit were locked up for 23½ hours per day,\nsometimes in closed front cells called \"boxcars.\" The district court held that these practices constituted cruel and\nunusual punishment, enjoined the nonconsensual use of boxcar cells and ordered the defendants to provide the\ninmates with at least seven hours of exercise per week either indoors or outdoors.\nAccording to appellants' brief, each inmate in the Control Unit is confined to a cell measuring 78 by 96 inches\n(length and breadth) and 100 inches high and may not participate in group activities available to the general\n[4]\nprison population.  Inmates are handcuffed upon leaving their cells (except for showering or recreation), and\ntheir access to the library is restricted. Personal property is limited and there are few opportunities to earn money.\nPrison officials exercise some discretion over what reading materials inmates may receive from outside the\nprison. \"Contact\" visits with family and friends are not permitted. Thus prisoners are separated from their visitors\n\nby a plexiglass partition and must communicate over telephones. Prisoners are \"strip searched\" before and after\nsuch visits.\nPrisoners in the Control Unit find it difficult to communicate with each other because of a glass or metal partition\nplaced three feet in front of most cells. Each cell is equipped with a 40 or 60 watt light bulb, and there is little\nnatural light. Prison officials, not doctors, decide whether to transfer a mentally ill prisoner out of the Control Unit.\nPrison guards who work on the Control Unit are not specially trained. Inmates are not placed in the Control Unit\nfor definite periods of time, although the district court ordered periodic review of the reasons for their continued\nconfinement. Regular prison food is served to those in the Control Unit, although seconds are not available and\nthe food is sometimes cold.\nIn analyzing these facts, it is important to note that the Eighth Amendment \"must draw its meaning from the\nevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78\nS.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). In applying the Eighth Amendment to certain types of punishment, courts\nhave generally forbidden \"intentionally inflicted excessive or grossly severe punishment . . . or that conditions so\nharsh as to shock the general conscience. . . .\" La Batt v. Twomey, 513 F.2d 641, 648 (7th Cir. 1975); French v.\nHeyne, 547 F.2d 994, 1002 (7th Cir. 1976). The \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\" was disapproved in \nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2925, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976), as well as practices or\nconditions found to be \"barbarous.\" Sweet v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, 529 F.2d 854, 860 (4th Cir.\n1975). The conditions at issue here, while undoubtedly severe, do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment\nas defined in these cases.\nSeveral circuit courts of appeals have considered the segregation of prisoners in circumstances similar to those\nof the instant case and have declined to find a violation of the Eighth Amendment. See Sweet, supra, 529 F.2d\n854, 860-866 and Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (2nd Cir. 1971) (en banc), cert. denied,404 U.S. 1049, 92\nS.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972) and 405 U.S. 978, 92 S.Ct. 1190, 31 L.Ed.2d 254 (1972). In these cases, as\nwell as in the instant case, the segregated area was not overcrowded or unsanitary. Inmates had some reading\nmaterials and an opportunity to exercise. \"Seconds\" at meals were not available and food was occasionally cold,\nbut it was the same food as that served to the general prison population. Appellants have not contended that\naccess to medical care, bedding or heating was insufficient or that the nutritional value of the food was\ninadequate; such factors are frequently crucial to a finding of cruel and unusual punishment.\n614 *614 Inactivity, lack of companionship and a low level of intellectual stimulation do not constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment even if they continue for an indefinite period of time, although the duration \"is a factor to be\nconsidered, especially if the confinement is punitive.\" Sweet, supra, 529 F.2d 854, 861. Expert testimony that\nsuch segregation could cause psychological harm is not determinative. Sostre, supra, 442 F.2d 178, 190-193.\nSince the district court has ordered periodic review of the reasons why an inmate is held in the Control Unit, and\nthe results of such a review may be appealed to the district court, we do not feel that the indefinite nature of the\nadministrative segregation in this case constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nAppellants claim that the conditions successfully challenged in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57\n[5]\nL.Ed.2d 522 (1978) \"mirror the conditions of life in the Marion Control Unit in many respects,\"  but the only\nsimilarity which exists is the indefinite nature of the confinement in both cases. In Hutto, the Supreme Court\nupheld the district court's order which limited the time an inmate could be confined in \"punitive isolation\" to 30\ndays. In doing so, the Court specifically noted the \"interdependence\" of the conditions at the prison, the prior\nunheeded district court orders to remedy constitutional violations and the severity of those violations, and\nconcluded that the district court \"was justified in entering a comprehensive order to insure against the risk of\ninadequate compliance.\" 437 U.S. 678, 687-688, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2572, 57 L.Ed.2d 522. The conditions\nchallenged in Hutto were described by the Court as involving the placement of at least four prisoners in a cell\nmeasuring 8 feet by 10 feet which contained no furniture. Their food was \"grue\" which provided only 1000\ncalories per day. No precautions were taken to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, which had infected\nsome of these prisoners. The district court offered the prison officials several opportunities to correct these\nconditions on their own and, when they did not do so, entered the order in question. 437 U.S. 678, 682-683, 98\nS.Ct. 2565, 2572-2573, 57 L.Ed.2d 522.\n\nThe conditions at Marion and the conduct of defendants in the instant case do not \"mirror\" those in Hutto, and,\ntherefore, we see no reason to limit the use of administrative segregation in the instant case to a fixed period of\ntime since periodic review has already been required. Indeed, to do so would be to intrude upon the exercise of\nthe defendant's lawful discretion in an impermissible way. See Kelly v. Brewer, 525 F.2d 394, 399-400 (8th Cir.\n1975). Thus, the conditions in the Control Unit (as modified by the district court) do not involve the kinds of\npunishment which would violate the Eighth Amendment.\nSimilarly, we do not find a constitutional violation under the second analysis provided by the Supreme Court\n(involving proportionality) even though we agree that a punishment may be enjoined if it is so out of proportion to\nthe offense that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. In the leading case of Weems v. United States, 217\nU.S. 349, 366-367, 30 S.Ct. 544, 548-549, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910), a sentence of 12 years at hard labor and the loss\nof many civil rights was imposed for the crime of falsifying a public document and was said to \"amaze\" those who\n\"believe that it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the]\noffense.\" The use of denationalization as a punishment for desertion from the navy in time of war was also\nsuccessfully challenged as cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment in Trop v. Dulles, 356\nU.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). This court has recognized in an earlier stage of this litigation that the\nproportionality principle may be applied to punishment within a prison for disciplinary offenses. Adams v. Carlson,\n615 488 F.2d 619 (7th Cir. 1973).[6] But as we noted in that *615 case, disproportionality \"is partly a question of fact\nand wholly one of degree.\" 488 F.2d 619, 636. Appellants have not demonstrated that the conditions in the\nControl Unit, as it now exists, are so disproportionate to the seriousness of the offenses for which the inmates\nwere convicted that they constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\nWe also hold that for purposes of the Eighth Amendment the practices which appellants challenge are not\nunrelated to valid penological objectives such as deterrence, rehabilitation and institutional security (although we\ndo not adopt this test as necessarily based upon an appropriate interpretation of the Amendment). The inmates\nplaced in the Control Unit pursuant to the standards and procedures mandated by the district court have been\nfound to present a significant threat to the personal safety of guards and other prisoners and to the orderly\noperation of the prison. Thus, it is in the interests of institutional security to limit time out of cells, to use handcuffs\nwhen such prisoners are outside their cells and to restrict their access to facilities which are available to the\ngeneral prison population. Some limits on the prisoners' First Amendment freedoms may also be imposed if\n[7]\nreasonably related to these legitimate penological objectives,  and appellants do not claim that the restrictions\nimposed in the instant case are unrelated to such objectives.\nWhile rehabilitation is a valid penological objective, this court has held that the failure to provide rehabilitation\nprograms, without more, does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. French v. Heyne, 547 F.2d 994, 1002\n(7th Cir. 1976). In light of the increased risk of altercations which could result from augmented rehabilitation\nprograms, the limitation of these programs may serve the objective of institutional security and is not cruel and\nunusual punishment. Similarly, the added safety of serving food to the Control Unit inmates while they remain in\ntheir cells serves a valid objective. Appellants have not claimed that the food available is so insufficiently\nnutritious as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Cunningham v. Jones, 567 F.2d 653 (6th Cir. 1977).\nEven if this standard (requiring reasonable relation to valid penological objectives) were applied to the facts of\nthis case, prison officials must necessarily be allowed some discretion in deciding how to reach those goals. It is\nwell within their discretion to decide not to provide any special training for guards at the Control Unit and not to\ngive psychological testing to every inmate who is placed in the Control Unit. (See Bowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d\n44, 47-48 (4th Cir. 1977) which sets forth guidelines for providing psychological treatment for prisoners.)\nAppellants also contend that the lighting in the Control Unit and the strip searches after non-contact visits are not\nsufficiently related to a legitimate penological objective and therefore constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\nWhile we are not necessarily persuaded that these two practices constitute cruel and unusual punishment, we\nhave ordered the district court to consider them on remand in the context of due process (see section 3, infra).\nWe believe that the Due Process Clause will provide a better framework in which to analyze these and other\nproblems than the Eighth Amendment.\n\n3. Substantive Due Process\nThe district court held that the inmates had a limited liberty interest under the Due Process Clause because the\ndefendants' rules gave rise to the expectation of their being able to remain in the general population unless they\n616 demonstrated their inability to adjust to the general prison *616 population.[8] To place inmates who have not\ndemonstrated such an inability in the Control Unit would be a violation of substantive due process and was\nenjoined by the court. Since the inmates, however, had only a limited liberty interest in avoiding confinement in\nthe Control Unit, the district court held that the proper standard for review of the defendants' actions in connection\nwith the confinement of inmates to the Control Unit was that such actions and procedures have a rational basis.\nWe agree with the district court that the inmates' liberty interest is a limited one and is not a fundamental interest\nof the sort, the abridgment of which could be justified only by a compelling state interest. Appellants argue that\nthe prisoners at Marion have a fundamental interest in avoiding assignment to the Control Unit because there is a\nfundamental right to avoid arbitrary confinement by the government. This right according to appellants, is\nprotected by the First, Fourth, Eighth and Ninth Amendments; according to this argument the government must\nshow a compelling state interest to justify confining any citizen, including a prisoner.\nWhile the man in the street may be entitled to such broad protection, it is not fully available to a convicted\nprisoner. The Supreme Court has recognized that \"[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or\nlimitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\" \nPrice v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1060, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948). Thus, in the instant case, the\n\"lawfully incarcerated\" prisoners have only a limited interest (for purposes of the Due Process Clause) in\nremaining in the general prison population, and the government's actions need only have a rational basis; a\ncompelling state interest need not be demonstrated.\nWe find that there is a rational basis for maintaining and operating a Control Unit at Marion, as circumscribed in\n[9]\nthe particular respects spelled out by the district court.  Prison officials have an obligation to the prisoners and\nstaff to keep them safe from harm by other prisoners, and administrative segregation of dangerous prisoners is a\nreasonable way to achieve this goal. Kelly v. Brewer, 525 F.2d 394 (8th Cir. 1975). Prison officials also have an\nobligation to society in general to keep prisons operating in an orderly manner, and segregation of those who\ndisrupt these institutions is a reasonable way to meet this obligation. \"The fact of confinement and the needs of\nthe penal institution impose limitations on constitutional rights, including those derived from the First Amendment,\nwhich are implicit in incarceration.\" Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union, 433 U.S. 119, 125, 97 S.Ct. 2532,\n2537-38, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977).\nAppellants also criticize the district court's failure to consider whether the conditions found in the Control Unit are\nreasonably related to the defendants' interest in preserving institutional security. We can understand the district\ncourt's reluctance to review these conditions because the Supreme Court has recently emphasized the\nimportance of deference to the informed discretion of prison officials. See Jones, supra, and Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). However, such deference has its limits. \"[I]n the absence of\n617 substantial evidence in the record *617 to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these\nconsiderations, courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.\" Pell v. Procunier, supra,\n417 U.S. at 827, 94 S.Ct. at 2806 [emphasis supplied]. Similar limitations on the general \"hands-off\" policy have\nbeen noted in Jones, supra, 433 U.S. at 128, 97 S.Ct. at 2539 and in Newman v. State of Alabama, 503 F.2d\n1320, 1329 and 1332 (5th Cir. 1974),cert. denied,421 U.S. 948, 95 S.Ct. 1680, 44 L.Ed.2d 102 (1975).\nThere is substantial evidence in the record before us to make an inquiry into the conditions of confinement\nappropriate. Defendants \"exaggerated their response\" to the legitimate interest in institutional security, and the\nnature of their response led to the imposition of procedural safeguards by the district court and changes in some\nconditions which were found to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. These abuses occurred after\ndefendants had already been involved in litigation in federal court as a result of similar practices in the context of\npunitive segregation. Adams v. Carlson, supra. We, therefore, remand these proceedings to the district court for a\n\ndetermination whether certain conditions imposed on inmates in the Control Unit are reasonably related to the\ninterest which defendants cite as supporting their use of the Control Unit 00 i. e., the need for institutional security.\n97\nWe are particularly concerned with the strip searches of inmates before and after non-contact visits with family\nand friends. Guards handcuff the inmates before they leave the Control Unit and escort them to the visitation\n[10]\narea. The inmates are separated from the visitors by plexiglass, and guards observe these visits.  We do not\nbelieve that the rationale announced in Bell v. Wolfish, supra, justifies these strip searches. Thus, the Supreme\nCourt in Wolfish relied on the possibility of contraband being brought into the prison during contact visits to justify\nthe use of strip searches. Those contact visits were not closely supervised by guards. Wolfish should not be\nextended to the facts of this case without a showing that there is some risk that contraband will be smuggled into\nMarion during non-contact, supervised visits, or that some other risk within the prison will be presented. Since\ndefendants do not discuss the searches in their brief, we are not in a position to dispose of the issue and,\n[11]\ntherefore, the district court should consider it on remand.\nWe are also concerned with the adequacy of lighting in the cells since reading is one of the few activities\n[12]\navailable to inmates in the Control Unit.  Defendants did not discuss the lighting in their brief. Their response\nat oral argument to questions about the rationale for poor lighting was that defendants had discretion to\ndetermine whether the use of more than one light bulb would give an inmate significantly more glass than a\nsingle bulb out of which to fashion a weapon. We question whether such a concern could justify cells which were\nso poorly lighted that prisoners could not read. On remand, the district court may, in applying the rational basis\ntest to significant matters, take evidence on these and like topics.\nWe do not disagree with the dissenting view here that prison administrators know their own business better than\ndo we judges. We would certainly hope and expect that the state of the administrators' relative expertise is as\n618 Judge Wood's opinion *618 suggests. Such expertise in their own business is, in fact, found among persons of all\nwalks of life, who happen to become parties to actions in federal court. But our lack of expertness does not\npreclude our attempting here and elsewhere to draw constitutional and other lines, where that seems necessary,\nor requiring the district courts to draw such lines. Judge Foreman has acted with commendable thoroughness in\nthe matters before him, and we remand only as to the few questions where the record is unclear or, in the case of\nlights, dim.\nAppellants also claim that one of the factors (involving \"disruption\"), which defendants may take into account in\ndeciding to confine an inmate to the Control Unit, is overly broad and unconstitutionally vague and allows\ndefendants to punish inmates for constitutionally protected behavior. This factor relates to \"incidents involving a\ndisruption of the orderly operation\" of the prison. Defendants may base their confinement decisions upon this\namong other factors.\nWe reject appellants' argument because, as we have stated, judicial review of confinement proceedings is\navailable, and one of the issues subject to review is whether confinement in the Control Unit is being used\npunitively. If it is, the prisoner must be returned to the general population because such a use of the Control Unit\nis a violation of substantive due process. The district court in the instant case ordered defendants to provide\nspecific notice of such allegedly disruptive incidents (which may form the basis of confinement decisions),\ntogether with reasons why such incidents were considered disruptive. The sufficiency of these reasons is, of\ncourse, subject to judicial review. Since the district court will be able to construe the requirements of disruptive\nincident determinations as narrowly as is necessary to comply with constitutional standards, no significant\nproblem of vagueness or overbreadth is presented. Given such safeguards, reliance on allegedly disruptive\nincidents is properly committed to the defendants' informed discretion, and should not have a significant chilling\neffect on legitimate rights of prisoner complaint or protest or religious or political freedom.\n4. Procedural Due Process\nThe procedural safeguards established by the district court are sufficient under the flexible standards set forth in \nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) and Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471,\n92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). These cases set forth standards of procedural due process for prisoners\n\ninvolved in disciplinary procedures and revocation of parole. In general, \"consideration of what procedures due\nprocess may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature\nof the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental\naction.\" Morrissey, supra, 408 U.S. at 481, 92 S.Ct. at 2600, citing Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union v. Mc\nElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748-49, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961).\nThe protections provided by the district court strike a reasonable balance between the defendants' need to have\na secure, orderly institution and the Control Unit inmates' need for protection against unwarranted segregation.\nAppellants argue that the procedures mandated by the district court have been abused in practice. We feel that\nthe safeguards are adequate in principle; any abuse of them may be challenged in the district court on review of\nthe individual commitment proceedings.\nMore specifically, the Court in Morrissey required the following procedural safeguards in the context of a parole\nrevocation: (1) written notice of claimed violations, (2) disclosure of evidence against the prisoner, (3) an\nopportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence, (4) an opportunity to\nconfront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not\nallowing confrontation), (5) a hearing before a \"neutral and detached\" person (who the Court specified could not\n619 be the parole officer but who *619 need not be a judge or a lawyer), and (6) a written statement by the fact\nfinders as to the evidence relied on, the action taken, and the reasons for that action. 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at\n2604. It has also, however, been noted that \"[t]he very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible\nprocedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation.\" Cafeteria Workers v. Mc Elroy, 367 U.S. 886,\n895, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961), cited in Wolff, supra, 418 U.S. at 560, 94 S.Ct. at 2976-2977.\nThe district court ordered the defendants to provide hearings complying with these standards when inmates are\ninitially confined to the Control Unit as well as periodic review of the reasons for their continued confinement.\nThe procedures required by the district court fully comply with the Due Process Clause, as construed in the cases\ncited supra. Appellants would prefer a hearing officer who is not employed by the Bureau of Prisons, but this\nrestriction would be inappropriate since the district court has described the qualifications of the hearing officer in\nsuch a way as to eliminate persons who lack significant correctional experience as well as those who might be\nbiased because they have been involved in another disciplinary or administrative matter with the same inmate.\nAppellants also assert that inmates are being placed in the Control Unit on the basis of confidential information\nwhich cannot be disclosed. The hearing officer, however, must document his reasons for not calling witnesses or\nintroducing documentary information, and must list the evidence on which his decision is based. Since this record\nmay be reviewed by the district court, the procedure ordered does not admit of significant abuse by defendants. \nSee Hayes v. Walker, 555 F.2d 625 (7th Cir. 1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 959, 98 S.Ct. 491, 54 L.Ed.2d 320.\nThe orders of the district court are therefore affirmed in part and remanded in part for further proceedings in\naccordance with this opinion.\nHARLINGTON WOOD, Jr., Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI fully concur with the careful analysis of the majority concluding that no cruel and unusual punishment has been\ndemonstrated in any respect, but I see little justification for remand to consider separately as possible due\nprocess violations the wattage of the light bulbs in the cells or the strip searches required in connection with\nvisitations.\nThe majority mentions the failure of the defendants to discuss in their brief either the search issue or the light\nbulb issue. I believe that to be because neither of those matters has heretofore been considered as separate\nconstitutional issues by either party. Those complaints were only two of numerous other complaints or details\nalleged by plaintiffs which were claimed in their \"totality\" to add up to unconstitutional confinement in the Control\nUnit. The majority has in effect found that there is nothing unconstitutional in the totality of the circumstances, but\nthat there may be something unconstitutional about particular aspects of the confinement. I am reluctant to try to\nfashion new constitutional issues for the parties on appeal, particularly since I view both of the matters to be\nlacking in any possibility of reaching constitutional dimension. Nevertheless, even assuming the majority's\nsuggestion that the new issues it raises may reach that level, I have little doubt that the prison officials did not act\nimproperly.\n\nThe newly-fashioned constitutional lighting issue appears to be nothing more than concern for the wattage of the\nlight bulb in each cell. It is not disputed that 60-watt or 40-watt bulbs are provided. Perhaps some prisoners may\nprefer 100-watt bulbs, but I do not consider the mere difference in wattage to raise a constitutional question\nrequiring judicial intervention. If, for example, plaintiffs had alleged the use of excessively bright and glaring light,\nor a blinking light, or one so weak that there was danger to a prisoner in trying to move about the cell, I, too,\n620 might see some merit in pursuing *620 the issue on a constitutional basis. However, no claims of that nature have\nbeen made. For that matter, the first suggestion that the wattage of the bulbs may be unconstitutional was raised\nnot by the plaintiffs, but by this court at oral argument.\nPlaintiffs do not contend that the strip searches are indiscriminate or done merely to harass inmates. Apparently,\nthe strip searches in question occur only in connection with the exercise of a prisoner's occasional visitation with\na family member. The partition in the visitation room between family and inmate is no guarantee against the\ninmate gaining possession of contraband during some part of the whole procedure. The inmate was placed in\nadministrative segregation in the first place because it had already been determined that he presented a\nsignificant danger to the safety of himself, other prisoners, or the staff. The prisoners segregated on that basis\nafter being culled from the other inmates of a maximum security penitentiary deserve special security attention. At\nthe time of visitation the prisoner must leave the control unit area and move through the other areas of the\npenitentiary to a visitation room previously used from time to time by other inmates. Prison officials may well be\nconcerned with what a devious prisoner may pick up or have surreptitiously slipped to him by another prisoner\nalong the way to and from visitation.\nEven plaintiffs' own expert witness testified that he knew that \"deadly weapons exist in all prisons and I think it is\nan interesting question how one deals with that.\" He went on to explain that it had to be dealt with as a \"serious\nreal problem in prisons.\" Dr. Menninger, one of defendants' expert witnesses, illustrated the severe security\nproblems that can develop with prisoners by relating an episode occurring in another penitentiary where a\nprisoner requested to be assigned to another section and while being transferred managed to break his\nhandcuffs and stab an officer. Another of defendants' expert witnesses testified that contraband in a penitentiary\nis a major problem. Another of plaintiffs' witnesses testified that at Marion before the Control Unit was so named\nbut when a similar unit was in use, weapons and gun powder were found in the unit. Apart from that testimony\nalready in this record it is common knowledge that even in an efficiently run penal institution periodic shakedowns\nproduce surprising amounts of weapons, drugs and other contraband. The occasional strip search may be a\nsource of embarrassment or discomfort to a prisoner in the Control Unit, but I believe the searches are without\nany possible constitutional significance in the interest of security.\nParticularly in a case such as this where prisoners have not challenged conditions other than in their totality\njudicial review of those individual conditions is little more than the substitution of our judgment about prison\nadministration for that of the prison officials charged with the day-to-day operations of the institutions.\nJudges, after all, are human. They, no less than others in our society, have a natural tendency to\nbelieve that their individual solutions to often intractable problems are better and more workable\nthan those of the persons who are actually charged with and trained in the running of the\nparticular institution under examination. But under the Constitution, the first question to be\nanswered is not whose plan is best, but in what branch of the Government is lodged the authority\nto initially devise the plan. This does not mean that constitutional rights are not to be scrupulously\nobserved. It does mean, however, that the inquiry of federal courts into prison management must\nbe limited to the issue of whether a particular system violates any prohibition of the Constitution,\nor in the case of a federal prison, a statute. The wide range of \"judgment calls\" that meet\nconstitutional and statutory requirements are confided to officials outside of the Judicial Branch of\nGovernment.\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 562, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1886, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Chief Judge Foreman devotes\n621 much of his time to *621 prison matters. Applying his knowledge and experience, including a personal inspection\nof the Control Unit, he has sorted through the plaintiffs' complaints and has remedied all that deserve a\nconstitutional cure. The significance of the majority opinion is not the time that will be required by the court and\nprison officials to reconsider the light bulb and search issues. Instead, it appears that this court has sua sponte\n\nbestowed constitutional significance on the many minor details of prison administration. I would leave all those\ndetails to our prison administrators who are experienced and knowledgeable in their difficult profession. We are\nnot. I do not believe a court should meddle in prison affairs unless legitimate constitutional issues are raised that\nrequire our intervention. Id. The two remaining matters, even if they had been properly raised, are not of that\nquality.\nI would affirm on all issues and respectfully dissent only on the remand requirement.\n[1] The district court's decisions, including a more detailed statement of the facts, are reported at 450 F.Supp. 934\n(E.D.Ill.1978) and 462 F.Supp. 146 (E.D.Ill.1978).\n[2] Appellants' Brief, p. 14.\n[3] In Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 561 F.2d 411 (1st Cir. 1977), the circuit court of appeals rejected the district court's\napplication of the \"legitimate penological objectives\" test, noting that \"at the present stage of development of the\nlaw relating to prisoners, the test used by the district court is not required by the Constitution. No majority opinion\nof the Supreme Court has ever adopted it; and the language in dissents and concurrences provides little support\nfor it.\" 561 F.2d at 415.\n[4] This description of the Control Unit is not challenged by defendants, so we assume it to be accurate.\n[5] Appellants' Brief, p. 20.\n[6] In Adams v. Carlson, inmates at Marion were segregated for indefinite terms as punishment for a work\nstoppage and other offenses. This court ordered hearings which would comply with the requirements of due\nprocess before such discipline could be imposed, but refused to find a violation of the Eighth Amendment on a\ndisproportionality theory.\n[7]See Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974).\n[8] The existence of such prison regulations and the extent of the change in conditions distinguishes this case\nfrom the situation in Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2523, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976), in which the\nSupreme Court held that prisoners had no liberty interest in remaining in any one prison, and therefore were not\nentitled to a hearing before they were transferred for administrative reasons from a minimum security prison to\none having maximum security.\n[9] We accept the need for a Control Unit as a \"totality.\" However, we think it is our duty, in an effective\nexamination of the \"totality,\" to review significant specific conditions involved in the operation of the Control Unit\nto determine whether they have a rational basis. See Newman v. State of Alabama, 503 F.2d 1320 (5th Cir.\n1974),cert. denied,421 U.S. 948, 95 S.Ct. 1680, 44 L.Ed.2d 102 (1975) and our discussion of specific\nconditions, infra.\n[10] Testimony concerning visitation procedures appears at pages 265-268, 398-399, 456, 493-512, 678 and 848\nof the trial transcript. We assume the practices described in this testimony and in the district court's Findings of\nFact (Numbers 40 through 47) have continued up to the present time.\n[11] There is some evidence that strip searches are not required in connection with inmates' contact visits with\ntheir counsel. (See the Findings of Fact of the district court, Numbers 40 and 41.) We do not understand these\napparent discrepancies, and only a remand can clarify the matter, which seems to us important.\n[12] We do not agree with the apparent thrust of the separate opinion that nearly total darkness or some other\nextreme of lighting is a sine qua non of constitutional concern.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Tockman, Howard Eglit, Chicago, Ill., for plaintiffs.\nU. S. Atty., represented by Frederick J. Hess, Asst. U. S. Atty., East St. Louis, Ill., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nFOREMAN, Chief Judge:\nThis matter is before the Court following a bench trial. Post trial briefs have been submitted and closing argument\nwaived.\n[1]\nThe case is a class action, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2).  The class is composed of all inmates currently\nconfined in the Marion Penitentiary Control Unit and all who will be so confined in the future. Jurisdiction is\npredicated upon 28 U.S.C. § 1331(a).\nThe Court hereby makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. The United States Penitentiary at Marion, Illinois (hereinafter referred to as Marion) is classified as a maximum\n937 security *937 institution maintained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and is designed to hold 525 prisoners.\n2. Defendant, Griffin Bell, is the Attorney General of the United States and pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4001 is\ncharged with the management and control of all federal penal and correctional institutions.\n3. Defendant, Norman Carlson, is the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and is charged pursuant to 18\nU.S.C. § 4041 and 28 C.F.R. Subpart Q with the responsibility of administering the federal prisons.\n4. Ralph Aaron was the Warden of Marion and in that capacity was charged with the responsibility of\nadministering the entire institution, including the Control Unit.\n5. George Wilkinson is the Warden of Marion and in that capacity is charged with the responsibility of\nadministering the entire institution including the Control Unit.\n6. Harold Miller is an Associate Warden at Marion and in this capacity is responsible for the general supervision\nof the Control Unit.\n7. Rayford Johnson was an Associate Warden at Marion and in that capacity was responsible for the general\nsupervision of the Control Unit. He was also an advisor of the Institution Discipline Committee.\n8. The Control Unit Manager was Ralph Whitehouse, who had the responsibility for the care, custody and control\nof H-Unit under the supervision of the administrative staff members of Marion.\n\n9. Edward Posey is the Acting Control Unit Manager, who has the responsibility for the care, custody and control\nof the unit under the supervision of the administrative staff members of Marion.\n10. Maurice Sigler is the Chairman of the U.S. Board of Parole, and is charged with the responsibility and control\nof the board.\n11. Marion is divided in nine (9) housing units labeled A through I.\n12. I-Unit is the housing area utilized for short-term segregation at Marion.\n13. H-Unit is the housing area utilized for long-term control at Marion and it is referred to as the Control Unit.\n14. A through F-Units are currently utilized to house the general population of Marion.\n15. H-Unit is divided into four ranges, labeled A, B, C, and D, each of which range contains 18 single person\ncells.\n16. Each cell in the Control Unit measures approximately 6'6\" by 8' by 8'6\" (high), has three concrete walls and a\nsteel bar front and is equipped with the following fixtures:\n(a) one steel bunk;\n(b) a stainless steel commode and sink combination;\n(c) one light fixture containing a 40 or 60 watt light bulb.\n17. On A and D Range and on ten cells in B-Range in the Control Unit, there exists a wall constructed of\nplexiglass and steel which is placed approximately three feet in front of the cell. A window is constructed in this\nwall and may be closed or opened at the discretion of the prisoner or a correctional officer. The decision of a\ncorrectional officer overrides that of a prisoner in the event of a dispute.\n18. The last ten (10) cells of B Range in the Control Unit, hereinafter referred to as B-Range closed front cells,\nare equipped with a steel front door (with window) which is kept closed as a disciplinary measure or at the\nprisoner's request.\n19. There are no mirrors in Control Unit cells. Control Unit prisoners are restricted on the amount of personal\nproperty they may have in their cell. See Marion Policy Statement MI-7300.80A dated 5/30/75, p. 2, Appendix.\n20. Control Unit prisoners, unless confined in B-Range closed front cells, are allowed to utilize personally owned\nradios provided that earphones are utilized. These radios must be battery operated since cells in the Control Unit\ndo not have electrical outlets.\n938 21. A prisoner placed in closed front B-Range for disciplinary reasons has only legal *938 material and some\nreligious material. However, prisoners who have requested a cell for study or those who were placed there as a\nresult of construction on A-Range have been permitted to retain their personal property.\n22. Control Unit prisoners are handcuffed at all times when they leave their cells for any purpose other than\nshowering or recreation.\n23. Control Unit prisoners confined in B-Range closed front cells are handcuffed at all times when they leave their\ncells. For the purpose of recreation and showers they are uncuffed in their secured recreation area and shower\narea.\n24. Prisoners not employed in the C-Range industry program in the Control Unit are generally confined in their\ncells for an average of 23 hours and 20 minutes per day.\n25. Although the menu in the Control Unit is the same as that offered to the prisoners in general population,\nsecond helpings are not available.\n\n26. The quantity of food provided each prisoner is the same. It is served from a hot cart located outside of D-\nRange in the Control Unit and placed on individual trays, six of which are placed on an unheated serving cart and\nwheeled to the prisoner in his cell by a correctional officer.\n27. Prisoners in the Control Unit are not allowed to attend educational classes. They are allowed to take\ncorrespondence courses of their choice in their cell. Marion pays one-half of the cost of correspondence courses\nfor prisoners without funds or who have no veterans benefits. Doodle art supplies are also furnished by the\ninstitution. Vocational training opportunities available to prisoners in the Control Unit include correspondence\ncourses and the C-Range industry.\n28. Except on C-Range, there is no television in the Control Unit to allow educational or recreational viewing.\n29. Prisoners in the Control Unit are not allowed in the institution library. Control Unit prisoners are allowed to\nselect books they wish from a library cart.\n30. No group religious services are permitted in the Control Unit. No group gatherings are allowed in the unit\nexcept for multiple recreation.\n31. A work opportunity is maintained on C-Range within the Control Unit which consists of four punch press\nmachines used in the manufacture of fasteners for U.S. Mail Bags. The machines are enclosed with individual\nmesh cells. Two additional mesh cells are work areas and have been added for assembly purposes. Participation\nin the C-Range industry is a favorable factor considered by the Control Unit Committee in evaluating a prisoner's\nconduct while in the Control Unit.\n32. Generally, two Control Unit prisoners are permitted to recreate simultaneously, however, a prisoner recreates\nalone because he wishes to or the staff feels he should recreate alone.\n33. Prisoners in the Control Unit receive commissary items from a restricted commissary list once every two (2)\nweeks.\n34. Group activities are not permitted in the Control Unit, except for multiple recreation.\n35. Prisoners are received in the Control Unit from three (3) sources: The Marion general population; another\nFederal or State Prison; or by direct designation following conviction.\n36. Special Progress Reports contain summaries of log entries which consist of observations and conclusions\nmade by Correctional Officers of the day-to-day activities and behavior of unit prisoners be it positive or negative.\n37. In making the determination whether a prisoner should remain in the Control Unit, Warden Aaron placed\nsubstantial weight on the reservations and recommendations of the Control Unit Committee and the Special\nProgress Reports. This determination is currently made in accordance with Marion Policy Statement\nMI-7300.80A.\n939 38. As of January, 1975, prisoners confined in the Control Unit are informed in *939 writing whether their\nincarceration therein will be for a term of three (3), six (6), nine (9) months or indefinite. As of February 28, 1975,\nof the forty-nine (49) inmates in the Control Unit, four (4) had a three month term, eight (8) had a six month term,\nthree (3) had a nine month term, and thirty-four (34) had an indefinite term. All prisoners were informed that their\nprojected release would be conditional upon obtaining a \"satisfactory\" monthly rating for the prescribed term. As\nof June 11, 1975, of the thirty-eight (38) inmates housed in the Control Unit, two (2) had three month terms, six\n(6) had six month terms, nine (9) had nine month terms, and twenty-one (21) had indefinite terms.\n39. The three (3) categories of prisoners who are currently placed in the Control Unit are enumerated on Page 2\nof MI-7300.80A, under Subpart 5 titled \"Assignment to a Control Unit.\"\n40. Prisoners in the Control Unit are required to conduct all visits, except attorney visits, in a control visiting room\nin which the prisoner and visitor are separated by a plexiglass wall through which they may see each other and\nspeak by means of telephone.\n\n41. The Control Unit prisoners are strip searched before and after all visits excepting attorneys' visits.\n42. Visitors' handbags are checked for contraband prior to visiting in the control visiting room and population\nvisiting room.\n43. If a Control Unit prisoner and his visitor wish to exchange documents in the control visiting room, the prisoner\nor visitor must give the document to the officer assigned to the visiting room. This officer then carries the\ndocument from the presenter's side of the glass to the recipient's side of the glass, which requires him to be out\nof the view of both. The document, if not prohibited, is then given to the visitor or prisoner in the control visiting\nroom.\n44. There have been no instances of contraband being found in the Control Unit which had come from outside\nthe institution since January 1, 1974.\n45. During all visits in the Control Unit visiting room, a Correctional Officer is stationed inside of the population\nvisiting room and is in position to observe the parties meeting therein.\n46. Marion Policy Statement 73300.80 dated June 7, 1973, is superseded by MI-7300.80A, dated May 30, 1975.\n47. All visitors are required to walk through a metal detector prior to entering the control visiting room and\npopulation visiting room when the machine is in operation.\n48. If confined in an area where the lighting is poor, some people may tend to feel depressed.\n49. If any prisoner in the Control Unit is evaluated by Dr. Robert Carr as having a mental disease, he would\nrecommend that the individual be immediately treated at Marion by the medical department at Marion and the\nindividual's case referred to the Springfield Medical Center for observation, diagnosis, and indicated treatment.\n50. Doctor Kenneth Bowles' recommendations that prisoners be sent to Springfield Medical Center were not\nalways immediately followed. For example, Dr. Bowles' recommendation that Merle Chaussee, a Control Unit\nprisoner, be transferred to Springfield was not accomplished for six months. Transfer to Springfield is restricted\nfrom time to time for want of bedspace.\n51. Some of the behavior of prisoners in the Control Unit, or a penitentiary, can be attributed to the conditions of\ntheir confinement and the frustrations each individual perceives as a result of confinement in the Control Unit or a\npenitentiary.\n52. No psychological evaluation is done immediately prior to or subsequent to a term of confinement in the\nControl Unit. Rather, individual evaluations are made while the individual is in the unit.\n53. A physician's assistant makes daily rounds in the Control Unit by walking through the unit and checking and\nadministering to the needs of those prisoners who are awake or of those to whom he has been directed by the\ndoctors and correctional staff.\n940 *940 54. No medical check-up is done on prisoners prior to or upon assignment to the Control Unit, unless the\nindividual has requested one or has not had an earlier federal physical.\n55. A Control Unit prisoner in a hospital cell is not let out of his room except for emergency examinations or\ndiagnosis. A prisoner in general population who is in the hospital has his door open from 6:00 A.M. through 10:30\nP.M. depending upon his condition and availability of supervisory personnel.\n56. Prisoners who have no money in their commissary accounts do not receive a monthly stipend from the\nBureau of Prisons.\n57. The cells contain 52 square feet of floor space. The activities which take place in the cell are reading, writing,\neating, sleeping, and possibly listening to a radio. Communication in the Control Unit is restricted due to the use\nof partitions of steel and glass which separate most cells.\n\n58. Prisoners are released from their cells for approximately 30 minutes a day for exercise recreation on a locked\ntier, sometimes with one other person. Recreation outside in the fresh air occurs approximately one hour per\nmonth. These limited periods are the only opportunity for social interaction between prisoners. Correctional\nofficers and other staff are seldom on the tiers and very seldom speak to prisoners.\n59. Idleness pervades the Control Unit. Most prisoners have nothing to do. The impact of confinement on Control\nUnit prisoners' mental and physical health can be harmful, debilitating and dehumanizing.\n60. Prisoners who are incarcerated in the Control Unit remain there a minimum of three months. Most prisoners\nremain in the Control Unit for a year or longer and do not know how long they will remain or what they must do to\nbe released.\n61. Vocational and educational services and programs provided to prisoners in the Control Unit are limited. A\nlimited work opportunity is available to prisoners on C Range. All other prisoners are denied any vocational\nactivity. Educational opportunities other than G.E.D. certification are available only for those prisoners who can\nafford to purchase correspondence courses.\n62. Commissary privileges are available to Control Unit prisoners periodically, but the privilege is limited as to\nselection, quantity and dollar amount. Prisoners who do not have money cannot receive commissary. Other than\nC Range, no opportunity exists for earning money. Prisoners receive no stipend from the institution.\n63. The menu is varied, balanced and nutritious. The food prepared in the institution dining room is the same for\nstaff and inmates alike. It is served warm from hot carts. At times, however, food has become cold or cold\nlunches are served.\n64. Commissary privileges are provided for those who can afford them. For those who have no money, hygiene\nitems, tobacco, and reading material are provided.\n65. The stated purpose of the control unit is as a preventive measure and not as punishment [MI-7300.80A,\ndated 5/30/75, pages A, C, F(4)]. In individual instances classification to the control unit has been used as a\npunishment.\n66. The only way in which a person's behavior can be predicted is on the basis of his past behavior under similar\nconditions. Although predictions are possible, they are difficult to make and may be erroneous.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nPlaintiffs raise five legal issues in support of their claims. Briefly stated, these issues are as follows. First, whether\nclassification of an inmate to the control unit is violative of substantive due process? Second, whether\ncommitment to the control unit, without a finding of a specific disciplinary offense, violates the Eighth\nAmendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment? Third, whether current procedures for\nclassification to the control unit violates procedural due process? Fourth, whether conditions of confinement\n941 within the control unit, and specifically the \"boxcars\", violates the Eighth Amendment? *941 Fifth and finally,\nwhether the policy of requiring inmates, who are confined in the control unit, to conduct social visits via the\n[2]\nenclosed glass partitions, and by use of a telephone, violates the Eighth Amendment.  As stated, these issues\nare not self-contained. There is a considerable overlap, as would be expected in a case of this complexity.\nNevertheless, as much as is possible, the Court will treat these issues seriatim.\nI. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS\nIt is well settled that the Due Process Clause provides substantive as well as procedural protections against\narbitrary government action. See, e. g., Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531\n(1977), and the discussion contained therein. Substantive due process protects individuals from government\naction so arbitrary as to violate protected interests. This limitation on the government is imposed, when\n\nappropriate, regardless of the particular procedural safeguards which may have been implemented along with a\nregulatory scheme. In addition, this limitation applies to agency actions as well as to legislative actions. See, e.g.,\nRasulis v. Weinberger, 502 F.2d 1006 (7th Cir. 1974).\nBy its very terms, however, the Due Process Clause protects only certain interests. Thus, the initial inquiry is to\ndetermine whether the plaintiffs' interest in remaining in the general population at Marion, rather than being\nassigned to the control unit, is protected by the clause.\nIn Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976), the Supreme Court rejected the\ncontention that any change in the conditions of confinement having an adverse impact on a prisoner involved the\nprotection of the Due Process Clause. In that case, the Court held that a state prisoner had no protected liberty\ninterest in remaining at one state institution rather than another. Thus, an intra-system transfer did not require a\nhearing. The Court did recognize, however, that a liberty interest could arise by virtue of state law.\nIn this case, there is no inherent liberty interest sufficient to invoke the protections of the Due Process Clause.\nThe plaintiffs have been validly convicted and thus their inherent liberty interests have been extensively curtailed.\nSee, Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977).\nNevertheless, a protected liberty interest is created in the defendants' policies themselves. Marion Policy\nStatement MI-7300.80A, dated May 30, 1975 (and its predecessor, MI-7300.80, dated June 7, 1973), states that\nplacement in the Control Unit is based on an inmate's demonstrated inability to adjust to an open institutional\nsetting. The inmates are led to expect that, so long as their behavior conforms to a mandated norm, they will\nremain in the general population. It is only upon some proof of nonconformity which will result in their placement\nin the control unit. The Court finds that this expectation, rooted in defendants' own policy statements, gives rise to\n[3]\na protected liberty interest. See, Walker v. Hughes, 558 F.2d 1247 (6th Cir. 1977).\nHaving found a protected liberty interest, the next step is to determine the standard for review of the challenged\n942 action. *942 Where fundamental liberty interests are involved, government action must further a compelling state\ninterest to withstand judicial scrutiny. See, e. g., Moore v. East Cleveland, supra; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479,\n81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960). When protected interests which do not rise to the level of fundamental rights\nare involved, however, the government need only show a rational basis for its actions. See, e. g., Nebbia v. New\n[4]\nYork, 291 U.S. 502, 54 S.Ct. 505, 78 L.Ed. 940 (1934).\nIn this case, the latter test is applicable. The plaintiffs' fundamental liberty interest has been extinguished by\nvirtue of their criminal convictions. The liberty interest at stake here is that of remaining in general population\nwithin the Marion prison. This interest is not entitled to the same protections as those interests emanating directly\nor implicitly from the Bill of Rights. Thus, there need be only a rational basis for any infringement on this interest.\n[5]\nThe policy statement on the control unit states the purpose of the control unit. That purpose is \"to remove proven\nand demonstrated behavior problems from the general population so that others may pursue their own program\nof work or self-improvement without fear of harm from these disruptive offenders.\" The critical question 00 whether\n97\nthis purpose justifies the removal of certain individuals from general population, must be answered in the\naffirmative. The loss to the individual is clearly outweighed by the stated purpose of the control unit, and quite\nclearly passes the rational basis test.\nThe Court also holds that incarceration in the control unit need not be subject to a time limitation. The purpose of\nthe control unit is to prevent violence and chaos before it occurs. Such prevention would be meaningless if prison\nofficials' discretion was subjected to time limitations. The Court, however, does recognize that the absence of any\ntime limitations is potentially dangerous. The Court believes that the constitutional requirements, set out in the\nsection on procedural due process, adequately protect against potential abuses in this open-ended arrangement.\n[6]\nWhile the general purpose of the control unit passes constitutional matter, as applied there are constitutional\ninfirmities. These infirmities exist both as regards to the substantive criteria used to implement the control unit\nprogram and also as those criteria are applied to individuals.\n\nPersons are assigned to the control unit because of the crime for which they are incarcerated, their prior conduct\nwithin the prison setting, or as protective custody cases. In making these general determinations, the following\nindividual factors are also taken into account:\n1. The nature of the offense which resulted in the offender's confinement.\n2. Incidents in which the offender has caused injury to fellow inmates during confinement.\n3. Incidents in which the offender has caused injury to government employees during\nconfinement.\n4. Incidents in which the offender has expressed threats to the life or well being of fellow inmates\nor staff members.\n943 *943 5. Escape attempts by the offender.\n6. Incidents involving possession of deadly weapons by an offender.\n7. Incidents involving possession of escape tools or plans by an offender.\n8. Incidents involving possession of dangerous drugs.\n9. Incidents involving a disruption of the orderly operation of a prison, jail, or other correctional\ninstitution.\nAt the trial, all evidence indicated that no reasonable prediction of an inmate's behavior in the prison could be\nbased on the crime for which he was convicted. Accordingly, the Court finds that any attempts to determine that\nan inmate will not function in the prison setting, based on the crime for which he was convicted, are violative of\ndue process.\nThe second method by which prison officials decide that a person should be placed in the control unit is through\na review of an inmate's institutional performance. The evidence indicated that this is a reasonable device. Thus, it\npasses constitutional muster, along with specific factors 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.\nFactors 5 and 7 concern escape. There was evidence that most of the inmates at Marion were serving long\nsentences and are potential escape risks. In fact, Marion itself is meant to be the most secure of all federal\ninstitutions. It is designed specifically to prevent escapes. Thus, every inmate is a potential candidate for the\ncontrol unit. While procedural safeguards should prevent abuse of these categories, the Court is also unable to\ndetermine any nexus between these categories and the removal of behavior problems from the general\npopulation. Since there is evidence showing these factors to be unreasonable, and no evidence supporting them,\nthe Court has to conclude that their use is violative of due process.\nNo particular showing was made regarding factor 8, therefore it cannot be deemed unreasonable.\nFactor 9 is a catch-all category. It is extremely broad and most individual abuses have occurred under its aegis.\nNevertheless, an inmate may create a powderkeg situation within the institution and still not fall within another\nrecognized category. Thus, there is a need by prison officials for such a broad factor. Surely the accomplished\ninstigator of riots is as dangerous to the prison community as the accomplished welder of a homemade knife.\nWhile procedural safeguards should protect against abuses of this factor, the past abuses of it merit comment.\nIn several instances, this criterion has been used to silence prison critics. It has been used to silence religious\nleaders. It has been used to silence economical and philosophical dissidents. And it has been used when no\nother rationale was available to justify incarceration in the control unit. Often no showing was made as to how\nthese persons disrupted the orderly running of the institution. Accordingly, if this general category is to be used,\nspecific notice and reasons for the action are required. The reasons must be sufficiently detailed to support the\nconclusion that the safety of the institution is threatened in some way other than those listed in the other\nacceptable factors.\n\nFinally, the Court finds that certain individuals were assigned to the control unit as punishment for specific acts.\nBureau of Prison policy specifically dictates that these violations of prison rules are to be dealt with through the\ninmate discipline procedures. Insofar as those procedures are bypassed, and the defendants make use of the\ncontrol unit as punishment, defendants are in violation of their own rules.\nTo correct these abuses, defendants are given ten (10) days within which to submit a list of the names of all\npersons currently confined in the control unit and the reasons for their confinement. Immediately thereafter, new\nhearings, in accordance with the procedural safeguards mandated infra, are to be conducted. Those persons\nfound to be unnecessarily confined in the control unit are to be released.\n944 *944 The remaining basis for confinement in the control unit 00 protection of an individual 00 is not properly before\n97 97\nthe Court. As far as the Court can determine, these individuals are assigned to administrative segregation. It does\nnot appear that any such person was ever, or will be, involuntarily assigned to the control unit for this reason.\nThus, it is unnecessary for the Court to consider it.\nII. EIGHTH AMENDMENT 00 NO CURRENT DISCIPLINARY OFFENSE\n97\nThe second issue articulated by trial counsel is whether confinement in the control unit without a finding of a\ncurrent specific offense violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. This argument is based on\nthe holdings that, even within a prison setting, punishment may be entirely disproportionate to the offense, and\nthus violate the Eighth Amendment. See, Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (7th Cir. 1973). Plaintiffs correctly\nreason that punishment for no offense is disproportionate and cruel and unusual.\nWhile recognizing this rule of law, the Court finds it inapplicable to the facts before it. The use of the control unit is\ndefinitely viewed as a punitive measure by the plaintiffs. The defendants view it as an administrative type\nsegregation. The Court, however, finds that neither of these characterizations is completely accurate. While use\nof the control unit is usually precipitated by some act, punishable at least internally, its intended purpose is not\npunitive, per se, for the act. Rather, the purpose is to prevent future disruptions within the institution. On the other\nhand, the evidence indicates that, in certain individual instances, use of the control unit has been as a punitive,\nrather than a preventive, measure. Accordingly, when used punitively, the Court has already found that there is a\nviolation of substantive due process. When used as a preventive measure, there will have been no finding of a\nspecific disciplinary offense. But incarceration therein will not be punitive per se, therefore no Eighth Amendment\n[7]\nviolation results.\nIII. PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS\nThe Court has previously found a protected liberty interest involved in this case. As such, procedural safeguards\nare required. The Court finds that the proper safeguards begin with those enunciated in Wolff v. McDonnell, 418\nU.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). As Wolff itself recognized, however, these procedures are\nflexible. Accordingly, the Court will discuss in detail each particular procedural protection and its minimal\nacceptable application. The Court also will discuss the additional safeguards it deems constitutionally necessary.\nA. Written Notice of the Claimed Acts\nThis Wolff requirement is necessarily altered by the nature of the particular proceeding. The Court finds that, in\nthis context, the inmate must be given written notice of the acts, or series of acts, which have led prison officials\nto contemplate taking the preventive measure of confinement in the control unit. This notice must be specific\nenough to allow the inmate to understand the proposed action. For example, if the inmate is being considered for\nplacement in the control unit because of his previous assaultive conduct within the prison system, the notice\nshould specify the prior assaultive incidents. If several prior acts constitute the charges, these all should be\nspecifically identified.\n\nB. Witnesses and Documentary Evidence\nThe inmates, in addition to a personal hearing, should be permitted to present documentation evidence in their\n945 behalf, and, in the discretion of prison officials, call witnesses *945 in their behalf. In short, the inmate is\nconstitutionally permitted to explain why he is able to function within the prison population without posing a threat\nto the other inmates or staff.\nC. Confrontation\nThere need be no confrontation of witnesses, although the inmate is entitled to be informed of the evidence\nagainst him when doing so will not endanger anyone.\nD. Impartial Decision Maker\nNot only is the inmate entitled to an impartial decision maker, he is also entitled to a decision maker qualified to\ndetermine whether the extreme measure of removing a person from population is justified. This decision involves\nmuch more than a simple weighing of facts. It involves professional expertise. The defendants are hereby\nordered, and plaintiffs permitted, to submit a proposal to implement this requirement.\nE. Written Reasons\nIf the decision is made to classify an inmate for the control unit, detailed reasons for the action are required. The\nCourt emphasizes that reasons are required in part to facilitate later review, both administrative and judicial. To\nserve this function the reasons cannot be merely boilerplate. Detailed reasons facilitate later review, help prevent\narbitrary decisions, and provide the affected individual with a rationale for the decision.\nF. Review\nAn inmate is classified to the control unit because there has been a determination that his continued presence\nwithin the prison population presents a danger to the health and well-being of others. When assigned to the\ncontrol unit, the inmate's status has drastically changed. To insure fairness and protect against mistakes, the\nCourt finds that some review of the initial decision is necessary. The review must be sufficiently near in time to\nthe decision to protect against an erroneous decision without undue curtailment of the inmate's privileges.\nDefendants are ordered, and plaintiffs permitted, to submit proposals on this issue.\nG. Periodic Review\nSome form of periodic review is required to insure that continuing incarceration in the control unit is required. The\nCourt recognizes the difficulty involved. Initially, an inmate is placed in the control unit because his past conduct\nwithin the general population has enabled prison officials to predict that his continued incarceration therein\nimposes a threat to the health and well-being of staff and fellow inmates. Once confined to the control unit, an\ninmate is unable to demonstrate his ability to function again in the general population. Thus, there is a real\ndanger that, once confined to the control unit, an inmate could remain there indefinitely. To protect against such a\nresult, some form of periodic review is required. The defendants are ordered, and plaintiffs permitted, to file with\nthis Court suggested procedures for accomplishing meaningful review to determine when releases to population\n[8]\nis warranted.\n\nH. Procedures for Release from Control Unit\nAt trial, two of plaintiff's biggest objections to the control unit were the lack of a time limitation on confinement\ntherein and a lack of information available to the inmates to inform them what they could do to expedite their\nrelease. The Court has previously ruled that, since the control unit is a preventive and not a punitive device, no\nspecific time limits can be imposed. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the inmates should be informed of what\naffirmative actions they may take to expedite their release from the control unit. Defendants are required, and\nplaintiffs permitted, to submit proposals through which they may comply with this procedural safeguard.\n946 *946 In conclusion, the Court finds that the foregoing are the minimal procedural safeguards required.\nDefendants are free, of course, to provide greater safeguards than those mandated above.\nThe Court also emphasizes that the procedures just described are not coextensive with those to be followed\nwhen dealing with inmate discipline. Thus, an inmate accused of assault will be given a Wolff type hearing. Upon\na finding of guilt he will be appropriately punished. Thereafter, the defendants may determine that the inmate is\ntoo dangerous to remain in the open population, and initiate proceedings to place him in the control unit. At this\nstage the above described procedures are mandated.\nIV. CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT IN THE CONTROL UNIT AS\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT\nPlaintiffs have attacked conditions of confinement within the control unit as amounting to cruel and unusual\npunishment. This attack is multi-faceted and focuses both on certain individual aspects of the control unit as well\nas the cumulative effect of such conditions.\nNo simple, concise legal definition of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment has been offered by\nthe courts. Instead, the courts have recognized that evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society must be taken into account, Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958).\nWithin this general framework, various tests have been enumerated 00 \"conditions `so foul, so inhuman, and so\n97\nviolative of basic concepts of decency',\" Adams v. Pate, 445 F.2d 105 (7th Cir. 1971); and whether the\npunishment offends \"broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity and decency.\" \nJackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571 (8th Cir. 1968).\nThe numerous courts dealing with this issue uniformly have focused on the particular facts before them and\nmeasured these facts against a standard evolved from current norms of society. Thus, most forms of corporal\npunishment have been rejected. See, Nelson v. Heyne, 491 F.2d 352 (7th Cir. 1974), and discussion therein.\nSimilarly, when prison conditions have so deteriorated as to be unfit for human habitation, a violation of the\nEighth Amendment has been found. See, e.g., Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974).\n[9]\nIn this case, neither of these two factual situations are present. There is no pattern of corporal punishment,  nor\nare the inmates deprived of the basic necessities of life. There is, however, a different type of punishment\nimposed. Plaintiffs' uncontroverted evidence showed the debilitating mental effect on those inmates confined to\nthe control unit. They were locked up in a closed-front cell 23½ hours per day. Little, if no, activity was offered to\nrelieve this boredom. Reading material, while available, was limited. Access to legal materials was limited.\nOutside physical exercise was sporadic, at best, and indoor exercise limited. Meaningful contact with other\npersons was virtually nonexistent. Rehabilitative programs were virtually nonexistent.\nThe most odious characteristic, however, was the closed-front cell, the boxcar. An inmate would spend nearly\nevery minute of every day in his cell, cut off from any contact with the outside world 00 even the limited \"outside\n97\nworld\" of the incarcerated felon. The inmates' existence was limited by the space of his cell and the\napproximately three feet beyond the cell bars, at which point the outer wall was erected. These walls contained\nbut a small window in the door. Even though the inmate could express a preference as to whether the outer door\n[10]\nwould be open or closed, the correctional officer had the final say in the matter.\n947\n\n*947 The sensory deprivations occasioned by use of the boxcars, along with the lack of any idea about what\ncould be done to be released from the control unit, resulted in both mental and physical deterioration.\nSimultaneously, unnecessary pain and suffering was the result. Finally, no justification for the use of the boxcars\nwas even offered at trial.\nModern technological advances are capable of rendering medieval tortures such as the rack and screw obsolete.\nThe potential for psychological and physiological torture is boundless00thus, the emerging role of the Eighth\n97\nAmendment in our society. A society which takes pride in its commitment to the preservation of human rights\nmust be ever vigilant to protect those rights. It cannot countenance any infringements on those rights which could\ncreate inroads into our ordered sense of decency. Accordingly, on the record before it, the Court finds that use of\nthe closed front cells, the boxcars, violates society's standards of humanity and dignity, and results in the infliction\nof unnecessary pain and suffering. Thus, it is violative of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and\nunusual punishment. The continued, nonconsensual use of a closed front cell is immediately enjoined. In\naddition, defendants are required, and plaintiffs permitted, to submit proposals to allow increased physical\nexercise, especially outside exercise, for those confined in the control unit.\nPlaintiffs also seek expanded educational and rehabilitative programs. The presence or absence of these\nprograms is not constitutionally mandated, Moody v. Daggett, 429 U.S. 78, fn. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236\n(1976). Therefore, no opinion is given on this issue.\nV. VISITATION\nPlaintiffs contend that visitation through glassed-in partitions, where there is no opportunity for physical contact,\nand where speaking must be by means of a telephone, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Plaintiffs argue\nthat visitation is a fundamental right and that the defendants must show a compelling state interest to justify an\ninfringement on that right. The Court disagrees.\nThe most obvious right forfeited by a convicted felon is the right of freedom of association. See, Jones v. North\nCarolina Prisoners Union, Inc., supra. Visiting procedure matters are within the scope of prison discipline and\nsecurity, and as such are subject to the broad discretion of prison officials. McCray v. Sullivan, 509 F.2d 1332 (5th\nCir. 1975)cert. denied,423 U.S. 859, 96 S.Ct. 114, 46 L.Ed.2d 86. See also, Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 94\nS.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974).\nIn this case, prison officials have restricted visitation, ostensibly to control the introduction of contraband into the\ninstitution. In making this determination, they are to be afforded wide latitude. The means are reasonably\ndesigned to meet the ends. The Court cannot state that such visitation procedures are so inhuman as to\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly, this claim is rejected.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby enters the following order:\n1. Defendants are enjoined from confining an inmate in the Control Unit solely because of the nature of the crime\nwhich resulted in his incarceration, for escape attempts, or incidents involving possession of escape tools or\nplans. If confined in the Control Unit for conduct which disrupts the orderly running of the institution, the inmate\nmust be given detailed notice as to the specific conduct referred to.\n2. Within ten (10) days defendants shall conduct a review of all inmates currently confined within the Control Unit.\nThose confined therein for any reason enumerated in the preceding paragraph are to be immediately released.\nDefendants may not confine any inmate in the Control Unit unless the inmate is given a hearing in conformance\nwith this memorandum opinion as it relates to procedural due process.\n948 *948 3. The defendants are enjoined from placement of an inmate in the Control Unit without conducting a\nhearing. The hearing shall include the following safeguards:\nA. Written notice of the acts which allegedly warrant placement in the Control Unit;\n\nB. A personal hearing on those charges, including the right to present witnesses in ones behalf\nunless doing so would jeopardize institutional security, in which case written statements would be\npermitted.\nC. Impartial decision maker with sufficient expertise to make the decision whether placement in\nthe Control Unit is warranted. Defendants shall submit a proposal to effectuate this provision.\nD. Reasons for the action taken.\nE. Review of the initial decision. Defendants shall submit a proposal to implement this provision.\nF. Periodic review of the status of inmates in the Control Unit. Defendants shall submit a proposal\nimplementing this provision.\n4. Defendants shall provide guidelines which an inmate can follow to expedite his release from the Control Unit.\n5. The nonconsensual placement in a \"boxcar\" type cell is enjoined. Defendants are given seven (7) days to\nremove all persons currently confined in such a cell to a different cell.\n6. Defendants shall submit a proposal providing for increased physical exercise for inmates confined in the\nControl Unit.\n7. Within thirty (30) days, defendants shall submit to this Court a status report of their compliance with this order.\nAt this time they also shall submit their proposals relating to implementation of this order requiring impartial,\nqualified decision makers, review of the initial decision, periodic review of the status of Control Unit inmates, and\nincreased physical exercise.\n[1] In addition, the following cases pending in this Court were consolidated with this case: CV74-167E;\nCV74-169E; CV75-208E; CV73-193E; CV74-260E.\n[2] These issues, although paraphrased, are essentially as stated by plaintiffs' counsel at trial. In their post trial\nmemorandum plaintiffs have organized, and even characterized, these issues slightly differently. The Court,\nhowever, finds that the issues, as stated in the text, more conveniently lend themselves to an organized\ntreatment, and thus will discuss them within that framework.\n[3] This result is not inconsistent with Meachum, supra. This Court has previously relied on Meachum to hold that\na federal prisoner may be transferred from one federal institution to another without an adverse effect on a\nprotected liberty interest, McDonnell v. United States Attorney General, 420 F.Supp. 217 (1976). In that case\nBureau of Prison Regulations were analyzed with the conclusion that they created no right to a hearing before a\ntransfer. In this case, however, a finding that the regulations give rise to a protected interest adequately\ndistinguishes Meachum.\n[4] These tests, while explicitly and succinctly stated in equal protection cases [e. g., San Antonia Independent\nSchool Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1974)], are recognized only implicitly in\nSupreme Court substantive due process cases. In dissent in Moore v. East Cleveland, supra, Mr. Justice White\nexplicitly acknowledges that these are the tests to be gleaned from the Court's prior pronouncements.\n[5] Plaintiffs argue that the compelling state interest test is proper since a protected interest is involved. According\nto them, any protected interest is entitled to this stricter scrutiny. This argument fails to recognize the numerous\ncases which have applied the rational basis test. Acceptance of this argument would be to totally disregard the\nrational basis test.\n[6] In Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (7th Cir. 1973), the Court discussed indefinite punitive segregation. In\nrefusing to find such a scheme per se unconstitutional, the Court noted that so long as periodic review attended\nby procedural safeguards, was provided, an indefinite \"sentencing\" scheme could continue.\n\n[7] This reasoning presupposes that specific charges will be made and proven which would warrant placement in\nthe control unit. Oftentimes, these same charges will have resulted in punitive disciplinary action, while their\ncumulative effect merits placement in the control unit.\n[8] The Court has been advised that defendants currently are reviewing periodically the status of those confined\nin the control unit.\n[9] Although isolated instances were alluded to during trial.\n[10] The Court recently visited the control unit to re-acquaint itself with the physical structure. When standing\ninside a cell, with the outer door closed, visibility was extremely limited. With the bars of the cell several feet from\nthe closed front of the cell, only a narrow angle of sight was permitted through the window of the outside wall.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

George Gilinsky, Senior App. Counsel, Crim. Div. Dept. of Justice, Washington, D. C., for defendants-\nappellees.\nBefore CUMMINGS, WOOD, and CUDAHY, Circuit Judges.\nCUDAHY, Circuit Judge.\nPlaintiffs-appellants brought this class action as representatives of all present and future inmates of the Marion\nPenitentiary who are or who may be confined in that institution's \"Control Unit.\" Appellants contend that both the\nconditions of confinement in the Control Unit and the manner in which prison officials decide to place inmates in\nthe Control Unit are unconstitutional. The district court ordered some changes in the conditions and in the\n[1]\ndecision-making process, which appellants claim are insufficient.  We affirm with respect to most of the matters\ntreated in the district court's two opinions but remand for further proceedings involving two matters as set forth\nherein.\nMarion is a maximum security prison, and it is one of a small number of federal prisons which contain a Control\nUnit, in which prisoners with demonstrably proven behavior problems may be confined in order to keep them out\nof the general prison population. Prisoners may be placed in the Marion Control Unit directly from the federal\ncourts, from the general population at Marion or from other federal and state prisons.\n1. Cruel and Unusual Punishment 00 Substantive Due Process\n97\nThe Control Unit at Marion consists of seventy-two single person cells and is one of nine units in which inmates\nare housed. Prisoners are placed in the Control Unit ostensibly for \"administrative segregation,\" i. e., for\nconfinement of prisoners who would present a significant danger to the safety of other prisoners or staff or who\nwould disrupt the orderly functioning of the prison if they were left in the general population. Confinement in the\nControl Unit is not intended to be for the purpose of punishment of prisoners, although the district court noted that\nit had been used punitively on a few occasions.\nAppellants claim (1) that the decision to confine an inmate in the Control Unit is a decision to impose cruel and\nunusual punishment because prisoners were thereby punished in the absence of an alleged and proven offense\nand (2) that specific conditions in the Control Unit are so harsh as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\n(This second argument is treated in section 2, infra.) In response to argument (1), the district court stressed that\nthe decision in question involved confinement for administrative reasons, not as a means of punishing\ndefendants. Appellants argue that confinement in the Control Unit is \"punitive in essence and effect\" and that\neven if the purpose were administrative, not punitive, the protections of the Eighth Amendment would still apply.\nWe agree that the Eighth Amendment protects the inmates from undergoing cruel and unusual punishment\nwithout regard to whether such punishment is imposed for punitive or administrative reasons. But this principle\n\ndoes not prevent defendants from deciding to change the conditions of confinement for administrative reasons,\nso long as the conditions do not involve cruel and unusual punishment. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678,\n612 686-687, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 *612 (1978) and Kelly v. Brewer, 525 F.2d 394, 399-400 (8th Cir. 1975).\nThe district court correctly held that if inmates were put in the Control Unit as a punishment for an offense or for\nno reason at all, they would have to be released because such treatment would be a violation of substantive due\nprocess. The court ordered defendants to conduct hearings, complete with the procedural safeguards discussed\nin section 4, infra, to determine if each inmate in the Control Unit was there for the purported administrative\npurpose 00 to remove those with demonstrable behavior problems from the general prison population. If any\n97\nprisoners were in the Control Unit for other reasons (which would include being confined there as a punishment),\nor for no reason at all, the district court ordered that they be released.\nWe find no error in the district court's decision to require the defendants to review the reasons why each inmate\nwas put in the Control Unit. Prisoners may, if necessary, seek judicial review of defendants' decision to confine\nthem in the Control Unit by filing suit in the district court, and, if the procedures for confinement prescribed by the\ndistrict court have not been followed or valid reasons for segregation have not been found, the district court will\norder their return to the general prison population.\nIf these procedures have been followed and prisoners are found to have been confined to the Control Unit for\nvalid and administrative reasons, placing prisoners in the Control Unit does not constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment because the prisoners are not being \"punished\" for an\noffense (other than the one for which they have been convicted). It is in this context that we affirm the district\ncourt's finding that, when the Control Unit is used as a preventive measure, the decision to place a prisoner there\nis not a violation of substantive due process or of the Eighth Amendment.\n2. Cruel and Unusual Punishment 00 Specific Conditions\n97\nAs mentioned above, however, conditions of imprisonment may in fact be cruel and unusual punishment even\nthough such conditions are imposed for administrative reasons. The Supreme Court has stated that the\nconstitutional proscription of cruel and unusual punishment imposes three different kinds of limitations upon the\ntreatment of prisoners. The cruel and unusual punishment provision (1) forbids the imposition of certain types of\npunishment, (2) proscribes punishment which is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime, and (3)\nimposes some limits on what may be made criminal and punished. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667, 97\nS.Ct. 1401, 1410, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977). Appellants contend, citing the first two categories above, that the\nconditions in the Control Unit constitute cruel and unusual punishment because these conditions are in and of\nthemselves impermissible types of punishment and because these conditions constitute punishment which is not\nin proportion to the severity of the relevant offense. Appellants also claim that the conditions in the Control Unit\nare cruel and unusual punishment because they are not \"premised upon, and limited to the purposes of\n[2]\nlegitimate penological principles or objectives.\"  While we question whether this third objection may be\n[3]\nsuccessfully derived from the existing case law,  we are not persuaded that the conditions in the Control Unit,\nas modified by the district court, are cruel and unusual punishment under any one of the three analyses\nsuggested.\n613 *613 Prior to the district court's order, prisoners in the Control Unit were locked up for 23½ hours per day,\nsometimes in closed front cells called \"boxcars.\" The district court held that these practices constituted cruel and\nunusual punishment, enjoined the nonconsensual use of boxcar cells and ordered the defendants to provide the\ninmates with at least seven hours of exercise per week either indoors or outdoors.\nAccording to appellants' brief, each inmate in the Control Unit is confined to a cell measuring 78 by 96 inches\n(length and breadth) and 100 inches high and may not participate in group activities available to the general\n[4]\nprison population.  Inmates are handcuffed upon leaving their cells (except for showering or recreation), and\ntheir access to the library is restricted. Personal property is limited and there are few opportunities to earn money.\nPrison officials exercise some discretion over what reading materials inmates may receive from outside the\nprison. \"Contact\" visits with family and friends are not permitted. Thus prisoners are separated from their visitors\n\nby a plexiglass partition and must communicate over telephones. Prisoners are \"strip searched\" before and after\nsuch visits.\nPrisoners in the Control Unit find it difficult to communicate with each other because of a glass or metal partition\nplaced three feet in front of most cells. Each cell is equipped with a 40 or 60 watt light bulb, and there is little\nnatural light. Prison officials, not doctors, decide whether to transfer a mentally ill prisoner out of the Control Unit.\nPrison guards who work on the Control Unit are not specially trained. Inmates are not placed in the Control Unit\nfor definite periods of time, although the district court ordered periodic review of the reasons for their continued\nconfinement. Regular prison food is served to those in the Control Unit, although seconds are not available and\nthe food is sometimes cold.\nIn analyzing these facts, it is important to note that the Eighth Amendment \"must draw its meaning from the\nevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78\nS.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). In applying the Eighth Amendment to certain types of punishment, courts\nhave generally forbidden \"intentionally inflicted excessive or grossly severe punishment . . . or that conditions so\nharsh as to shock the general conscience. . . .\" La Batt v. Twomey, 513 F.2d 641, 648 (7th Cir. 1975); French v.\nHeyne, 547 F.2d 994, 1002 (7th Cir. 1976). The \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\" was disapproved in \nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2925, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976), as well as practices or\nconditions found to be \"barbarous.\" Sweet v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, 529 F.2d 854, 860 (4th Cir.\n1975). The conditions at issue here, while undoubtedly severe, do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment\nas defined in these cases.\nSeveral circuit courts of appeals have considered the segregation of prisoners in circumstances similar to those\nof the instant case and have declined to find a violation of the Eighth Amendment. See Sweet, supra, 529 F.2d\n854, 860-866 and Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (2nd Cir. 1971) (en banc), cert. denied,404 U.S. 1049, 92\nS.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972) and 405 U.S. 978, 92 S.Ct. 1190, 31 L.Ed.2d 254 (1972). In these cases, as\nwell as in the instant case, the segregated area was not overcrowded or unsanitary. Inmates had some reading\nmaterials and an opportunity to exercise. \"Seconds\" at meals were not available and food was occasionally cold,\nbut it was the same food as that served to the general prison population. Appellants have not contended that\naccess to medical care, bedding or heating was insufficient or that the nutritional value of the food was\ninadequate; such factors are frequently crucial to a finding of cruel and unusual punishment.\n614 *614 Inactivity, lack of companionship and a low level of intellectual stimulation do not constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment even if they continue for an indefinite period of time, although the duration \"is a factor to be\nconsidered, especially if the confinement is punitive.\" Sweet, supra, 529 F.2d 854, 861. Expert testimony that\nsuch segregation could cause psychological harm is not determinative. Sostre, supra, 442 F.2d 178, 190-193.\nSince the district court has ordered periodic review of the reasons why an inmate is held in the Control Unit, and\nthe results of such a review may be appealed to the district court, we do not feel that the indefinite nature of the\nadministrative segregation in this case constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nAppellants claim that the conditions successfully challenged in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57\n[5]\nL.Ed.2d 522 (1978) \"mirror the conditions of life in the Marion Control Unit in many respects,\"  but the only\nsimilarity which exists is the indefinite nature of the confinement in both cases. In Hutto, the Supreme Court\nupheld the district court's order which limited the time an inmate could be confined in \"punitive isolation\" to 30\ndays. In doing so, the Court specifically noted the \"interdependence\" of the conditions at the prison, the prior\nunheeded district court orders to remedy constitutional violations and the severity of those violations, and\nconcluded that the district court \"was justified in entering a comprehensive order to insure against the risk of\ninadequate compliance.\" 437 U.S. 678, 687-688, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2572, 57 L.Ed.2d 522. The conditions\nchallenged in Hutto were described by the Court as involving the placement of at least four prisoners in a cell\nmeasuring 8 feet by 10 feet which contained no furniture. Their food was \"grue\" which provided only 1000\ncalories per day. No precautions were taken to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, which had infected\nsome of these prisoners. The district court offered the prison officials several opportunities to correct these\nconditions on their own and, when they did not do so, entered the order in question. 437 U.S. 678, 682-683, 98\nS.Ct. 2565, 2572-2573, 57 L.Ed.2d 522.\n\nThe conditions at Marion and the conduct of defendants in the instant case do not \"mirror\" those in Hutto, and,\ntherefore, we see no reason to limit the use of administrative segregation in the instant case to a fixed period of\ntime since periodic review has already been required. Indeed, to do so would be to intrude upon the exercise of\nthe defendant's lawful discretion in an impermissible way. See Kelly v. Brewer, 525 F.2d 394, 399-400 (8th Cir.\n1975). Thus, the conditions in the Control Unit (as modified by the district court) do not involve the kinds of\npunishment which would violate the Eighth Amendment.\nSimilarly, we do not find a constitutional violation under the second analysis provided by the Supreme Court\n(involving proportionality) even though we agree that a punishment may be enjoined if it is so out of proportion to\nthe offense that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. In the leading case of Weems v. United States, 217\nU.S. 349, 366-367, 30 S.Ct. 544, 548-549, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910), a sentence of 12 years at hard labor and the loss\nof many civil rights was imposed for the crime of falsifying a public document and was said to \"amaze\" those who\n\"believe that it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the]\noffense.\" The use of denationalization as a punishment for desertion from the navy in time of war was also\nsuccessfully challenged as cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment in Trop v. Dulles, 356\nU.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). This court has recognized in an earlier stage of this litigation that the\nproportionality principle may be applied to punishment within a prison for disciplinary offenses. Adams v. Carlson,\n615 488 F.2d 619 (7th Cir. 1973).[6] But as we noted in that *615 case, disproportionality \"is partly a question of fact\nand wholly one of degree.\" 488 F.2d 619, 636. Appellants have not demonstrated that the conditions in the\nControl Unit, as it now exists, are so disproportionate to the seriousness of the offenses for which the inmates\nwere convicted that they constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\nWe also hold that for purposes of the Eighth Amendment the practices which appellants challenge are not\nunrelated to valid penological objectives such as deterrence, rehabilitation and institutional security (although we\ndo not adopt this test as necessarily based upon an appropriate interpretation of the Amendment). The inmates\nplaced in the Control Unit pursuant to the standards and procedures mandated by the district court have been\nfound to present a significant threat to the personal safety of guards and other prisoners and to the orderly\noperation of the prison. Thus, it is in the interests of institutional security to limit time out of cells, to use handcuffs\nwhen such prisoners are outside their cells and to restrict their access to facilities which are available to the\ngeneral prison population. Some limits on the prisoners' First Amendment freedoms may also be imposed if\n[7]\nreasonably related to these legitimate penological objectives,  and appellants do not claim that the restrictions\nimposed in the instant case are unrelated to such objectives.\nWhile rehabilitation is a valid penological objective, this court has held that the failure to provide rehabilitation\nprograms, without more, does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. French v. Heyne, 547 F.2d 994, 1002\n(7th Cir. 1976). In light of the increased risk of altercations which could result from augmented rehabilitation\nprograms, the limitation of these programs may serve the objective of institutional security and is not cruel and\nunusual punishment. Similarly, the added safety of serving food to the Control Unit inmates while they remain in\ntheir cells serves a valid objective. Appellants have not claimed that the food available is so insufficiently\nnutritious as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Cunningham v. Jones, 567 F.2d 653 (6th Cir. 1977).\nEven if this standard (requiring reasonable relation to valid penological objectives) were applied to the facts of\nthis case, prison officials must necessarily be allowed some discretion in deciding how to reach those goals. It is\nwell within their discretion to decide not to provide any special training for guards at the Control Unit and not to\ngive psychological testing to every inmate who is placed in the Control Unit. (See Bowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d\n44, 47-48 (4th Cir. 1977) which sets forth guidelines for providing psychological treatment for prisoners.)\nAppellants also contend that the lighting in the Control Unit and the strip searches after non-contact visits are not\nsufficiently related to a legitimate penological objective and therefore constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\nWhile we are not necessarily persuaded that these two practices constitute cruel and unusual punishment, we\nhave ordered the district court to consider them on remand in the context of due process (see section 3, infra).\nWe believe that the Due Process Clause will provide a better framework in which to analyze these and other\nproblems than the Eighth Amendment.\n\n3. Substantive Due Process\nThe district court held that the inmates had a limited liberty interest under the Due Process Clause because the\ndefendants' rules gave rise to the expectation of their being able to remain in the general population unless they\n616 demonstrated their inability to adjust to the general prison *616 population.[8] To place inmates who have not\ndemonstrated such an inability in the Control Unit would be a violation of substantive due process and was\nenjoined by the court. Since the inmates, however, had only a limited liberty interest in avoiding confinement in\nthe Control Unit, the district court held that the proper standard for review of the defendants' actions in connection\nwith the confinement of inmates to the Control Unit was that such actions and procedures have a rational basis.\nWe agree with the district court that the inmates' liberty interest is a limited one and is not a fundamental interest\nof the sort, the abridgment of which could be justified only by a compelling state interest. Appellants argue that\nthe prisoners at Marion have a fundamental interest in avoiding assignment to the Control Unit because there is a\nfundamental right to avoid arbitrary confinement by the government. This right according to appellants, is\nprotected by the First, Fourth, Eighth and Ninth Amendments; according to this argument the government must\nshow a compelling state interest to justify confining any citizen, including a prisoner.\nWhile the man in the street may be entitled to such broad protection, it is not fully available to a convicted\nprisoner. The Supreme Court has recognized that \"[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or\nlimitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\" \nPrice v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1060, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948). Thus, in the instant case, the\n\"lawfully incarcerated\" prisoners have only a limited interest (for purposes of the Due Process Clause) in\nremaining in the general prison population, and the government's actions need only have a rational basis; a\ncompelling state interest need not be demonstrated.\nWe find that there is a rational basis for maintaining and operating a Control Unit at Marion, as circumscribed in\n[9]\nthe particular respects spelled out by the district court.  Prison officials have an obligation to the prisoners and\nstaff to keep them safe from harm by other prisoners, and administrative segregation of dangerous prisoners is a\nreasonable way to achieve this goal. Kelly v. Brewer, 525 F.2d 394 (8th Cir. 1975). Prison officials also have an\nobligation to society in general to keep prisons operating in an orderly manner, and segregation of those who\ndisrupt these institutions is a reasonable way to meet this obligation. \"The fact of confinement and the needs of\nthe penal institution impose limitations on constitutional rights, including those derived from the First Amendment,\nwhich are implicit in incarceration.\" Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union, 433 U.S. 119, 125, 97 S.Ct. 2532,\n2537-38, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977).\nAppellants also criticize the district court's failure to consider whether the conditions found in the Control Unit are\nreasonably related to the defendants' interest in preserving institutional security. We can understand the district\ncourt's reluctance to review these conditions because the Supreme Court has recently emphasized the\nimportance of deference to the informed discretion of prison officials. See Jones, supra, and Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). However, such deference has its limits. \"[I]n the absence of\n617 substantial evidence in the record *617 to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these\nconsiderations, courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.\" Pell v. Procunier, supra,\n417 U.S. at 827, 94 S.Ct. at 2806 [emphasis supplied]. Similar limitations on the general \"hands-off\" policy have\nbeen noted in Jones, supra, 433 U.S. at 128, 97 S.Ct. at 2539 and in Newman v. State of Alabama, 503 F.2d\n1320, 1329 and 1332 (5th Cir. 1974),cert. denied,421 U.S. 948, 95 S.Ct. 1680, 44 L.Ed.2d 102 (1975).\nThere is substantial evidence in the record before us to make an inquiry into the conditions of confinement\nappropriate. Defendants \"exaggerated their response\" to the legitimate interest in institutional security, and the\nnature of their response led to the imposition of procedural safeguards by the district court and changes in some\nconditions which were found to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. These abuses occurred after\ndefendants had already been involved in litigation in federal court as a result of similar practices in the context of\npunitive segregation. Adams v. Carlson, supra. We, therefore, remand these proceedings to the district court for a\n\ndetermination whether certain conditions imposed on inmates in the Control Unit are reasonably related to the\ninterest which defendants cite as supporting their use of the Control Unit 00 i. e., the need for institutional security.\n97\nWe are particularly concerned with the strip searches of inmates before and after non-contact visits with family\nand friends. Guards handcuff the inmates before they leave the Control Unit and escort them to the visitation\n[10]\narea. The inmates are separated from the visitors by plexiglass, and guards observe these visits.  We do not\nbelieve that the rationale announced in Bell v. Wolfish, supra, justifies these strip searches. Thus, the Supreme\nCourt in Wolfish relied on the possibility of contraband being brought into the prison during contact visits to justify\nthe use of strip searches. Those contact visits were not closely supervised by guards. Wolfish should not be\nextended to the facts of this case without a showing that there is some risk that contraband will be smuggled into\nMarion during non-contact, supervised visits, or that some other risk within the prison will be presented. Since\ndefendants do not discuss the searches in their brief, we are not in a position to dispose of the issue and,\n[11]\ntherefore, the district court should consider it on remand.\nWe are also concerned with the adequacy of lighting in the cells since reading is one of the few activities\n[12]\navailable to inmates in the Control Unit.  Defendants did not discuss the lighting in their brief. Their response\nat oral argument to questions about the rationale for poor lighting was that defendants had discretion to\ndetermine whether the use of more than one light bulb would give an inmate significantly more glass than a\nsingle bulb out of which to fashion a weapon. We question whether such a concern could justify cells which were\nso poorly lighted that prisoners could not read. On remand, the district court may, in applying the rational basis\ntest to significant matters, take evidence on these and like topics.\nWe do not disagree with the dissenting view here that prison administrators know their own business better than\ndo we judges. We would certainly hope and expect that the state of the administrators' relative expertise is as\n618 Judge Wood's opinion *618 suggests. Such expertise in their own business is, in fact, found among persons of all\nwalks of life, who happen to become parties to actions in federal court. But our lack of expertness does not\npreclude our attempting here and elsewhere to draw constitutional and other lines, where that seems necessary,\nor requiring the district courts to draw such lines. Judge Foreman has acted with commendable thoroughness in\nthe matters before him, and we remand only as to the few questions where the record is unclear or, in the case of\nlights, dim.\nAppellants also claim that one of the factors (involving \"disruption\"), which defendants may take into account in\ndeciding to confine an inmate to the Control Unit, is overly broad and unconstitutionally vague and allows\ndefendants to punish inmates for constitutionally protected behavior. This factor relates to \"incidents involving a\ndisruption of the orderly operation\" of the prison. Defendants may base their confinement decisions upon this\namong other factors.\nWe reject appellants' argument because, as we have stated, judicial review of confinement proceedings is\navailable, and one of the issues subject to review is whether confinement in the Control Unit is being used\npunitively. If it is, the prisoner must be returned to the general population because such a use of the Control Unit\nis a violation of substantive due process. The district court in the instant case ordered defendants to provide\nspecific notice of such allegedly disruptive incidents (which may form the basis of confinement decisions),\ntogether with reasons why such incidents were considered disruptive. The sufficiency of these reasons is, of\ncourse, subject to judicial review. Since the district court will be able to construe the requirements of disruptive\nincident determinations as narrowly as is necessary to comply with constitutional standards, no significant\nproblem of vagueness or overbreadth is presented. Given such safeguards, reliance on allegedly disruptive\nincidents is properly committed to the defendants' informed discretion, and should not have a significant chilling\neffect on legitimate rights of prisoner complaint or protest or religious or political freedom.\n4. Procedural Due Process\nThe procedural safeguards established by the district court are sufficient under the flexible standards set forth in \nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) and Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471,\n92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). These cases set forth standards of procedural due process for prisoners\n\ninvolved in disciplinary procedures and revocation of parole. In general, \"consideration of what procedures due\nprocess may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature\nof the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental\naction.\" Morrissey, supra, 408 U.S. at 481, 92 S.Ct. at 2600, citing Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union v. Mc\nElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748-49, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961).\nThe protections provided by the district court strike a reasonable balance between the defendants' need to have\na secure, orderly institution and the Control Unit inmates' need for protection against unwarranted segregation.\nAppellants argue that the procedures mandated by the district court have been abused in practice. We feel that\nthe safeguards are adequate in principle; any abuse of them may be challenged in the district court on review of\nthe individual commitment proceedings.\nMore specifically, the Court in Morrissey required the following procedural safeguards in the context of a parole\nrevocation: (1) written notice of claimed violations, (2) disclosure of evidence against the prisoner, (3) an\nopportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence, (4) an opportunity to\nconfront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not\nallowing confrontation), (5) a hearing before a \"neutral and detached\" person (who the Court specified could not\n619 be the parole officer but who *619 need not be a judge or a lawyer), and (6) a written statement by the fact\nfinders as to the evidence relied on, the action taken, and the reasons for that action. 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at\n2604. It has also, however, been noted that \"[t]he very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible\nprocedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation.\" Cafeteria Workers v. Mc Elroy, 367 U.S. 886,\n895, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961), cited in Wolff, supra, 418 U.S. at 560, 94 S.Ct. at 2976-2977.\nThe district court ordered the defendants to provide hearings complying with these standards when inmates are\ninitially confined to the Control Unit as well as periodic review of the reasons for their continued confinement.\nThe procedures required by the district court fully comply with the Due Process Clause, as construed in the cases\ncited supra. Appellants would prefer a hearing officer who is not employed by the Bureau of Prisons, but this\nrestriction would be inappropriate since the district court has described the qualifications of the hearing officer in\nsuch a way as to eliminate persons who lack significant correctional experience as well as those who might be\nbiased because they have been involved in another disciplinary or administrative matter with the same inmate.\nAppellants also assert that inmates are being placed in the Control Unit on the basis of confidential information\nwhich cannot be disclosed. The hearing officer, however, must document his reasons for not calling witnesses or\nintroducing documentary information, and must list the evidence on which his decision is based. Since this record\nmay be reviewed by the district court, the procedure ordered does not admit of significant abuse by defendants. \nSee Hayes v. Walker, 555 F.2d 625 (7th Cir. 1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 959, 98 S.Ct. 491, 54 L.Ed.2d 320.\nThe orders of the district court are therefore affirmed in part and remanded in part for further proceedings in\naccordance with this opinion.\nHARLINGTON WOOD, Jr., Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI fully concur with the careful analysis of the majority concluding that no cruel and unusual punishment has been\ndemonstrated in any respect, but I see little justification for remand to consider separately as possible due\nprocess violations the wattage of the light bulbs in the cells or the strip searches required in connection with\nvisitations.\nThe majority mentions the failure of the defendants to discuss in their brief either the search issue or the light\nbulb issue. I believe that to be because neither of those matters has heretofore been considered as separate\nconstitutional issues by either party. Those complaints were only two of numerous other complaints or details\nalleged by plaintiffs which were claimed in their \"totality\" to add up to unconstitutional confinement in the Control\nUnit. The majority has in effect found that there is nothing unconstitutional in the totality of the circumstances, but\nthat there may be something unconstitutional about particular aspects of the confinement. I am reluctant to try to\nfashion new constitutional issues for the parties on appeal, particularly since I view both of the matters to be\nlacking in any possibility of reaching constitutional dimension. Nevertheless, even assuming the majority's\nsuggestion that the new issues it raises may reach that level, I have little doubt that the prison officials did not act\nimproperly.\n\nThe newly-fashioned constitutional lighting issue appears to be nothing more than concern for the wattage of the\nlight bulb in each cell. It is not disputed that 60-watt or 40-watt bulbs are provided. Perhaps some prisoners may\nprefer 100-watt bulbs, but I do not consider the mere difference in wattage to raise a constitutional question\nrequiring judicial intervention. If, for example, plaintiffs had alleged the use of excessively bright and glaring light,\nor a blinking light, or one so weak that there was danger to a prisoner in trying to move about the cell, I, too,\n620 might see some merit in pursuing *620 the issue on a constitutional basis. However, no claims of that nature have\nbeen made. For that matter, the first suggestion that the wattage of the bulbs may be unconstitutional was raised\nnot by the plaintiffs, but by this court at oral argument.\nPlaintiffs do not contend that the strip searches are indiscriminate or done merely to harass inmates. Apparently,\nthe strip searches in question occur only in connection with the exercise of a prisoner's occasional visitation with\na family member. The partition in the visitation room between family and inmate is no guarantee against the\ninmate gaining possession of contraband during some part of the whole procedure. The inmate was placed in\nadministrative segregation in the first place because it had already been determined that he presented a\nsignificant danger to the safety of himself, other prisoners, or the staff. The prisoners segregated on that basis\nafter being culled from the other inmates of a maximum security penitentiary deserve special security attention. At\nthe time of visitation the prisoner must leave the control unit area and move through the other areas of the\npenitentiary to a visitation room previously used from time to time by other inmates. Prison officials may well be\nconcerned with what a devious prisoner may pick up or have surreptitiously slipped to him by another prisoner\nalong the way to and from visitation.\nEven plaintiffs' own expert witness testified that he knew that \"deadly weapons exist in all prisons and I think it is\nan interesting question how one deals with that.\" He went on to explain that it had to be dealt with as a \"serious\nreal problem in prisons.\" Dr. Menninger, one of defendants' expert witnesses, illustrated the severe security\nproblems that can develop with prisoners by relating an episode occurring in another penitentiary where a\nprisoner requested to be assigned to another section and while being transferred managed to break his\nhandcuffs and stab an officer. Another of defendants' expert witnesses testified that contraband in a penitentiary\nis a major problem. Another of plaintiffs' witnesses testified that at Marion before the Control Unit was so named\nbut when a similar unit was in use, weapons and gun powder were found in the unit. Apart from that testimony\nalready in this record it is common knowledge that even in an efficiently run penal institution periodic shakedowns\nproduce surprising amounts of weapons, drugs and other contraband. The occasional strip search may be a\nsource of embarrassment or discomfort to a prisoner in the Control Unit, but I believe the searches are without\nany possible constitutional significance in the interest of security.\nParticularly in a case such as this where prisoners have not challenged conditions other than in their totality\njudicial review of those individual conditions is little more than the substitution of our judgment about prison\nadministration for that of the prison officials charged with the day-to-day operations of the institutions.\nJudges, after all, are human. They, no less than others in our society, have a natural tendency to\nbelieve that their individual solutions to often intractable problems are better and more workable\nthan those of the persons who are actually charged with and trained in the running of the\nparticular institution under examination. But under the Constitution, the first question to be\nanswered is not whose plan is best, but in what branch of the Government is lodged the authority\nto initially devise the plan. This does not mean that constitutional rights are not to be scrupulously\nobserved. It does mean, however, that the inquiry of federal courts into prison management must\nbe limited to the issue of whether a particular system violates any prohibition of the Constitution,\nor in the case of a federal prison, a statute. The wide range of \"judgment calls\" that meet\nconstitutional and statutory requirements are confided to officials outside of the Judicial Branch of\nGovernment.\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 562, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1886, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Chief Judge Foreman devotes\n621 much of his time to *621 prison matters. Applying his knowledge and experience, including a personal inspection\nof the Control Unit, he has sorted through the plaintiffs' complaints and has remedied all that deserve a\nconstitutional cure. The significance of the majority opinion is not the time that will be required by the court and\nprison officials to reconsider the light bulb and search issues. Instead, it appears that this court has sua sponte\n\nbestowed constitutional significance on the many minor details of prison administration. I would leave all those\ndetails to our prison administrators who are experienced and knowledgeable in their difficult profession. We are\nnot. I do not believe a court should meddle in prison affairs unless legitimate constitutional issues are raised that\nrequire our intervention. Id. The two remaining matters, even if they had been properly raised, are not of that\nquality.\nI would affirm on all issues and respectfully dissent only on the remand requirement.\n[1] The district court's decisions, including a more detailed statement of the facts, are reported at 450 F.Supp. 934\n(E.D.Ill.1978) and 462 F.Supp. 146 (E.D.Ill.1978).\n[2] Appellants' Brief, p. 14.\n[3] In Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 561 F.2d 411 (1st Cir. 1977), the circuit court of appeals rejected the district court's\napplication of the \"legitimate penological objectives\" test, noting that \"at the present stage of development of the\nlaw relating to prisoners, the test used by the district court is not required by the Constitution. No majority opinion\nof the Supreme Court has ever adopted it; and the language in dissents and concurrences provides little support\nfor it.\" 561 F.2d at 415.\n[4] This description of the Control Unit is not challenged by defendants, so we assume it to be accurate.\n[5] Appellants' Brief, p. 20.\n[6] In Adams v. Carlson, inmates at Marion were segregated for indefinite terms as punishment for a work\nstoppage and other offenses. This court ordered hearings which would comply with the requirements of due\nprocess before such discipline could be imposed, but refused to find a violation of the Eighth Amendment on a\ndisproportionality theory.\n[7]See Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974).\n[8] The existence of such prison regulations and the extent of the change in conditions distinguishes this case\nfrom the situation in Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2523, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976), in which the\nSupreme Court held that prisoners had no liberty interest in remaining in any one prison, and therefore were not\nentitled to a hearing before they were transferred for administrative reasons from a minimum security prison to\none having maximum security.\n[9] We accept the need for a Control Unit as a \"totality.\" However, we think it is our duty, in an effective\nexamination of the \"totality,\" to review significant specific conditions involved in the operation of the Control Unit\nto determine whether they have a rational basis. See Newman v. State of Alabama, 503 F.2d 1320 (5th Cir.\n1974),cert. denied,421 U.S. 948, 95 S.Ct. 1680, 44 L.Ed.2d 102 (1975) and our discussion of specific\nconditions, infra.\n[10] Testimony concerning visitation procedures appears at pages 265-268, 398-399, 456, 493-512, 678 and 848\nof the trial transcript. We assume the practices described in this testimony and in the district court's Findings of\nFact (Numbers 40 through 47) have continued up to the present time.\n[11] There is some evidence that strip searches are not required in connection with inmates' contact visits with\ntheir counsel. (See the Findings of Fact of the district court, Numbers 40 and 41.) We do not understand these\napparent discrepancies, and only a remand can clarify the matter, which seems to us important.\n[12] We do not agree with the apparent thrust of the separate opinion that nearly total darkness or some other\nextreme of lighting is a sine qua non of constitutional concern.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
