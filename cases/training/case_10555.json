    "summary": "<p>On November 15, 2007, an individual who was strip searched after being charged with a petty crime filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Represented by the Texas Civil Rights Project and private counsel, the plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging as unconstitutional Bexar County Detention Center's policy or custom of strip searching misdemeanant arrestees even where they were not suspected of concealing weapons or contraband.</p><p>Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that she was arrested for an outstanding traffic warrant and taken to the Bexar County Detention Center, where she was subjected to a strip search upon admission. The plaintiff further alleged that, after being held for two days, she and 25 other pretrial detainees were ordered to change into jail-issued uniforms, at which time she was again strip searched. The plaintiffs allege that detainees were told to manipulate genitalia and sometimes \"squat and cough\" regardless of whether there was reasonable suspicion of contraband or weapons. The plaintiff claimed that the strip searches violated her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights in that they were conducted in the absence of any reasonable suspicion that she was hiding weapons or contraband. To remedy the alleged constitutional violation, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. </p><p>On April 2, 2009, both parties agreed to a consent decree that would provide permanent injunctive relief without further litigation. The decree dictated that the County Detention Center would no longer, absent reasonable suspicion that someone is concealing contraband, engage in the practice of strip searching or visual cavity searching those in their custody who are charged with misdemeanors. The County Detention Center also had to provide the court with an annual report regarding the implementation of the consent decree. Nothing in the consent decree addressed the plaintiff's request for compensatory and punitive damages. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the decree. The decree was signed by Judge Fred Biery of the Western District of Texas. </p><p>On November 16, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The parties continued to engage in discovery and settlement talks to resolve the damages claims. On August 26, 2010, the plaintiffs' submitted a motion of preliminary approval of the class-action settlement. The court preliminarily approved the settlement on October 13, 2010. After a fairness hearing, a final order of approval was granted on January 12, 2011.</p><p>The settlement agreement certified a class of plaintiffs composed of all detainees of Bexar County Detention Center between November 2005 and April 2009 who were subjected to strip searches and booked on misdemeanor or other minor charges. Those with felonies were not included. The class also had two subclasses. Subclass I was composed of all detainees not in subclass II, and subclass II included detainees booked on narcotics, shoplifting, and weapons-violation misdemeanors. All members of the class were to receive a pro rata share of the settlement after administrative expenses, attorneys' fees, and other expenses are counted for. </p><p>Attorneys' fees were $900,000 for this case. The court found this reasonable considering the amount of time put in and the complexity of the case. The settlement included $395,000 for the claim administrator, and $15,000 was given to the three class representatives for their work in the lawsuit. The fund was then be used to pay class members. Class members in subclass I could receive up to $1,000, and members of subclass II can receive up to $100. Class members could pay off court fines and fees in Bexar County with their settlement funds, but this was capped at $500 and $50 for the subclasses respectively.</p><p>On January 28, 2013, however, the district court dismissed this case, thus vacating and revoking the settlement agreement. In 2012, the Supreme Court decided <i>Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington</i>, holding that jail administrators may require all arrestees committed to the general population of the jail to undergo a no-touch visual strip search, even if the detainees is booked for a minor offense or reasonable suspicion is absent. The plaintiffs, their attorneys, and class members were not required to pay back any fees or funds they were awarded, but the County no longer needed to abide by the consent decree from April 9, 2009, that details how their strip search policy is to be conducted. They were now guided by the decision in <i>Florence</i>.</p>",

A settlement was preliminarily approved on October 13th, and officially approved on January 12th, 2011. The Agreement certified the class of petitioners, and required the County to create a $3.5 million fund. The fund paid for $900,00 in attorneys' fees, $395,000 for administrative costs, and $15,000 fees to each of the three class representatives. It also paid for damages to be paid to class members. \r\n\r\nON January 28th, 2013 the consent decree and the settlement agreement were vacated because of a Supreme Court decisions from 2012 holding that jail administrators could conduct no-touch visual strip searches of detainees, without reasonable suspicion that they detainee has contraband.

SA.;07·CA·928·FB \n) \nTHE COUNTY OF BEXAR,  ) \n) \nDefendant.  ) \nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSETTLEMENT AND JUDGMENT \nOn January 12, 2011, pursuant to this Court's Order of October 13,2010, and the Court having \nconducted a fina,l fairness hearing to detennine whether the proposed Settlement Agreement between \nthe parties is fair, reasonable and adequate, and to address Class Counsel's application for an award of \nattorney's fees and costs.  At the time of this hearing the Settlement Class Members having been \nrepresented by Class Counsel, and Defendant having been represented by its attorneys; \nThe  Court  having  read  and  considered the  Settlement  Agreement,  the  Notice  Plan,  the \nMemorandum of Law submitted by Class Counsel and the Certification of Charles J. LaDuca, one of \nthe Class Counsel, in support of the Settlement, having received evidence at the hearing, having heard \narguments from Class Counsel and the Defendant and any Obj ector present, and having considered all \nmatters in this case, now makes the following findings of fact, conclusions of law and ruling: \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 2 of 11\nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1.  This action was commenced on November 15, 2007, as a class action. \n2.  Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit and alleged Bexar County maintained a strip search policy and \npractice throughout the class period, pursuant to which all newly admitted pre-trial detainees, including \nthose admitted on misdemeanor offenses, were subjected to a strip search, often in a group setting, after \nbeing transported to the Bexar County Adult Detention Center.  To facilitate an inspection of body \ncavities, Plaintiffs contend detainees were required to manipulate their genitalia and buttocks, and \nsometimes \"squat and cough\" in view of a corrections officer. Female detainees were also required to \nmanipUlate their breasts. The strip search procedure involved an inspection of detainees' naked bodies, \nas well as the visual inspection of their body cavities.  Plaintiffs allege that this policy and practice \napplied to all detainees, without regard to the existence of reasonable suspicion to believe they were \nconcealing contraband.  Plaintiffs complain that in practice they were touched in an offensive manner \nor reasonably believed that they were about to be touched, or subjected to offensive touching. Plaintiffs \nallege these actions constituted a battery or assault. \n3.  After the almost three years of litigation, including motion practice and an intensive, arm's \nlength negotiation between Class Counsel and Defendants, including numerous mediation sessions with \nMichael Curry, Esquire, the parties have reached accord with respect to a Settlement which provides \nsubstantial benefits to Settlement Class Members, in return for a release and dismissal of all claims at \nissue in this case against the Defendant (\"Settlement Agreement\"). The resulting Settlement Agreement \nwas preliminarily approved by this Court on October 13, 2010, and in the Order Granting Preliminary \nApproval. \n2 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 3 of 11\n4.  As part ofthe Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a proposed Notice Plan \nand Class Notice, which provided Settlement Class Members notice of the proposed settlement.  The \nNotice Plan provided an opportunity for Settlement Class Members to file objections to the Class \nSettlement, and an opportunity to opt-out of the Class Settlement. \n5.  As of January 4, 2011, the Claims Administrator mailed a total of 34,375 Claim Packets to \nknown and potential Class Members. \n6.  The Claims Administrator determined a total of 29,602 unique individuals are eligible Class \nMembers. \n7.  As of January 4,2011, the Claims Administrator received approximately 2,575 Claim Forms. \n8.  Assuming all of the Claims Forms received to date are valid, the claims rate, out of 29,603 \nunique individuals, is approximately 8.7%, and this rate is almost certain to rise given that Class \nMembers have until March 16, 2011 to submit claims. \n9.  Class Counsel anticipate the ultimate valid claims rate will be at least 15%, which is within the \ntypical rate of return of claims in strip search class actions. 1 \nWilliams v. County ofL os Angeles, 97-cv-03826 (C.D. Cal.) (approximately 9% claims rate); Craftv. San Bernardino \n1 \nCounty, 05-cv-0359 (C.D. Cal.) (approximately 14% claims rate); Tyson v. City ofN  ew York, 97-cv-3762 (S.D.N.Y.) \n(approximately  12%  claims  rate);  Leyba  v.  County of Santa  Fe Bd.  of Commissioners,  05-cv-0036 (D.N.M.) \n(approximately 17% claims rate); Haney v. County ofM  iami Dade, 04-cv-20516 (S.D. Fla.) (approximately 16% claims \nrate); Connor v. Plymouth County, 00-cv-l0835 (D. Mass.) (approximately 18% claims rate); Boisselle v. County of \nMercer, No. 06-2065 (D.N.J. April 20, 2009) (approximately 22% claims rate); Graff v. County of Salem, 07-2259 \n(D.N.J.) (approximately 30% claims rate); Hicks v. County ofC amden, No. 05-1857 (D.N.J.) (approximately 16% claims \nrate); Mitchell v. County ofC  linton, No. 06-0254 (N.D.NY) (approximately 20% claims rate); Reynolds v. County of \nDauphin, 07-1688 (M.D. Pa.) (approximately 30% claims rate); Suggs v. County ofC  umberland, No. 06-00087 (D .N.J) \n(approxiinately 32% \"claims rate); Wilson v. County of Gloucester, No. 06-01368 (D.N.J.) (approximately 32% claims \nrate) \n3 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 4 of 11\n10.  Assuming the ultimate valid claims rate is 15%, with 80% ofthe claims received from members \nof Subclass 1, and the remaining 20% from members of Subclass 2, the payments to members of \nSubclass 1 would be approximately $437 and the paYJ1;lents to members of subclass 2 would be $100.2 \n11.  As of the deadline for the filing of obj ections, four obj ections were filed.  Given the size of this \nSettlement, and the Notice Plan described above, this Court finds that the total of four objections is \nindicative the plan is fair, reasonable and adequate. \n12.  Class Counsel has filed with the Court an affidavit from The Garden City Group declaring that \nthe mailing ofthe Court· approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan, is complete.  Additionally, \nClass Counsel evidenced the establishment of the Court·approved Class Settlement website. \n13.  The Court finds the Notice Plan, as effectuated, constitutes the best practicable notice of the \nFairness Hearing, proposed Settlement, Class Counsel's application for fees and expenses, and other \nmatters set forth in the Class Notice and Short Form Notice. The Court finds the Class Settlement valid, \ndue  and  sufficient notice  to  all  members  of the  Settlement Class,  and  complied fully with the \nrequirements of Rule 23 ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States, \nthe laws of Texas and any other applicable law. \n14.  Any persons who wished to be excluded from this action were provided an opportunity to \"opt-\nout\" pursuant to the Notice.  Ten individuals opted out of the settlement, though only five of these \nindividuals are Class Members. \nThis figure was calculated based on the current available settlement amount of $3 million, after the deduction of \n2 \nattorneys' fees, expenses, incentive awards, and administration-related expenses. \n4 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 5 of 11\n15.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the Settlement,  Settlement Agreement,  releases \ncontained within the Settlement Agreement, and the Final Order and Judgment. Settlement Class \nMembers do not have a further opportunity to opt-out of this Action. \n16.  Any Settlement Class Member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to the \nSettlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Class Counsel's application for \nfees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Class Notice and mandated \nin the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed to have waived any such obj ection \nby appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise.  Four individuals filed objections, and each was considered \nby the Court prior to the issuance of this Order. \n17.  On the basis of all  of the issues in this  litigation,  and the provisions  of the  Settlement \nAgreement,  the Court is  of the opinion the  Class  Settlement is  a fair,  reasonable and adequate \ncompromise of claims against the Defendant in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. There are a number offactors which the Court considered in affirming this Settlement, \nincluding: \na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nb.  Bexar County has continually asserted its policy has not been adjudged unconstitutional \nand that it carried out the strip search policy specifically to ensure the safety of detainees, employees \nof the jail, law enforcement officers and the general public, and for no other objectionable purpose. \nThis Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Settlement Class Members now, \nc~ \nwithout further litigation, under circumstances where the liability issues are still vigorously contested \namong the parties to this litigation and among the parties to the individual litigation.  This Settlement \nprovides Settlement Class Members with a substantial monetary benefit. \n5 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 6 of 11\nd.  This Settlement is clearly a product of hard-fought litigation between the parties, and not \na result of any collusion on the part of Class Counselor Counsel for the Defendant. \n18. The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair, a simplified process, and \nworkable.  The Court retains jurisdiction to work out any unanticipated problems. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n19.  This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this proceeding. \n20.  Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following Settlement Class is \ncertified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll pre-trial detainees confined to the Bexar County Adult Detention Center between \nNovember 15, 2005 and April 9, 2009 who were subjected to a strip search before being \nsent to jail housing after being booked on misdemeanor or other minor charges. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are pre-trial detainees who were subjected to strip \nsearch before being sent to jail housing after being booked on a felony charge, or a \nfelony charge and misdemeanor charge. \nThe Court also certifies the following two settlement subclasses: \nSubclass I:  All persons in the Settlement Class, not in Subclass II. \nSubclass II:  All persons in the Settlement Class who were admitted on misdemeanor \ncharges of narcotics, shoplifting and weapons violations.  The misdemeanor offenses \nwhich qualify as  those constituting charges of narcotics,  shoplifting and weapons \nviolations are defined by the parties in Exhibit G to this Settlement Agreement. \n21.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a class action is an appropriate method for \nresolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for class certification under Rule 23 are \npresent.  The Settlement Class Members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined.  Questions \n6 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 7 of 11\noflaw and fact common to all Settlement Class Members predominate over individual issues and should \nbe  determined  in  one  proceeding  with  respect  to  all  Settlement  Class  members.  The  Class \nRepresentatives' claims are typical of those of the Class.  The Class action mechanism is superior to \nalternative means for adjudicating and resolving this action. \n22.  The Settlement Class Representatives, Julia AIm Jackson, Martin Martinez, and Erica Bernal, \nare entitled to and are each hereby awarded a payment of $15,000, in recognition of the efforts they \nundertook in connection with this lawsuit.  All Settlement Class Members who have made claims on \nthe settlement are entitled to receive their pro rata share of the settlement fund for Subclass I, or \nSubclass II, after administrative expenses, attorneys' fees and expenses, and incentive awards are \ndeducted from the fund. \n23.  Class Counsel are qualified, experienced, and have aggressively litigated this case, thereby \ndemonstrating their adequacy as counsel for the Settlement Class.  Charles J.  LaDuca, Esq.  and \nAlexandra C. Warren, Esq. of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, Washington, DC; Sam H. Lock, Esq. of \nthe Law Offices of Sam H. Lock, San Antonio, Texas; Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esq. ofthe Law Offices \nof Elmer Robert Keach, III, Amsterdam, New York; Gary M. Mason, Esq. and Nicholas Migliaccio, \nEsq. of the Mason Law Firm, LLP, Washington, DC; James C. Harrington, Esq. of the Texas Civil \nRights Project, Austin, Texas; and Kerrisa Chelkowski, Esq. of the Law Office ofKerrisa Chelkowski, \nSan Antonio, Texas; are hereby appointed as Class Counsel. Class Counsel submitted to the Court and \nserved on Defendant their application for reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses consistent with \nthe terms of the_ Settlement Agreement, in the amount of $900,000.  The time spent on this litigation \nso far by Class Counsel is at least 1,931.3 5 hours oflawyer and legal assistant time.  This amounts to \na total lodestar of at least $782,025.00.  This amount is reasonable given the time spent, the complex \n7 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 8 of 11\nnature ofthis litigation, the fact that Class Counsel took this case on a contingent fee basis, and the fee \nis consistent with fees granted in similar cases.  Further, it appears that the total lodestar will not lead \nto any multiplier or will yield a negative multiplier.  With respect to expenses,  Class Counsel have \nincurred at least $60,194 in expenses in connection with the prosecution of this litigation, further \nreducing the multiplier. Accordingly; the Court find that final approval of attorneys' fees and expenses \nin the amount of $900,000 is warranted. \n24.  The Court finds the payment of the incurred and anticipated expenses of$345,000 ofthe Claims \nAdministrator, the Garden City Group, and the website administrator, as set forth in the Certification \nof Charles J. LaDuca is reasonable and justified. \nAccordingly, on the basis of the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is \nORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that: \n25.  The motion for Final Approval of the proposed Settlement is GRANTED. \n26.  The Class Representatives, Julia Ann Jackson, Martin Martinez, and Erica Bernal, are hereby \nawarded a payment of$15,000 each, in recognition of the efforts each undertook in connection with this \nlawsuit. All Settlement Class Members who have made claims on the settlement are entitled to receive \ntheir pro rata share of Subclass lor Subclass II of the Settlement Fund after administrative expenses, \nattorneys' fees and expenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the fund. \n27.  The Class Counsel's application for attorneys' fees and expenses is granted in the amount of \n$900,000. \n28.  The costs and expenses incurred to date or hereafter incurred for finalization ofthe Settlement \nby the Claims Administrator and Website Administrator,  estimated to be $395,000 and subjectto \n8 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 9 of 11\napproval by Class  Counsel,  are granted.  The Garden City Group  can disburse such reasonable \nadministrative costs from the Class Settlement Funds. \n29.  If a Class Member owes a Medicare lien it must be paid. \n3~.  If a Class Member who has filed a valid claim owes fines, fees, court costs or restitution by \nvirtue of a court order by a Bexar County Judge, that amount will be subtracted first from any Class \nMember's check, with the maximum of any such payment being one-half of that Class Member's \npayment, capped at $500.00 for Subclass I Class Members and $50.00 for Subclass II Class Members. \nThis subtracted amount will be paid directly to Bexar County. \n31.  If after distribution of Settlement checks to Settlement Class Members, there are unclaimed \nfunds as a result of Settlement checks being issued which are undeliverable or uncashed after 12 \nmonths, the Settlement Administrator shall pay these funds to the Bexar County Inmates Commissary \nFund. \n32.  Ifremaining funds exist after the pro rata distribution is made to the Settlement Class, with the \nmaximum payment to Members of Subclass I being $1,000.00 and the maximum payment to Members \nof Subclass II being $100.00, then Bexar County will receive a reverter of the remaining funds. \n33.  The Court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement until all outstanding litigation is concluded \nregarding the pending insurance coverage action between Bexar County and State National Insurance \nCompany and/or Star Insurance Company, and the settlement will remain open during that litigation. \nIn the event additional funds are to be paid into the settlement, then the Court will revisit an additional \ndistribution ofthose funds at that time. The settling parties may petition this Court to cease jurisdiction \nand close the file at the completion of the administration of the Settlement Class Fund. \n9 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 10 of 11\n34.  All Settlement Class Members who have nottimely filed an opt-out request are deemed to have \nwaived any rights or benefits under the Settlement Agreement and are barred and enjoined from \ncommencing any claim or action, individually or as a class action, that is based upon or related to the \nstrip search, booking process and related incidents that are the subject of the Settlement Agreement. \n35.  Defendant is hereby ORDERED to disclose the personal information of Class Members, to the \nreasonable extent necessary, including known address, dates of birth and social security numbers, to \nClass Counsel and the Claims Administrator, in order to facilitate the identification of Class Members \nfor purposes of mailing notice and assessing the validity of claims. \n36.  In accordance with the law, only Class Members who object to the Settlement pursuant to the \nterms immediately above may appeal this Order Granting Final Approval of Class Action Settlement \nand Judgment.  Any Class Member who wishes to appeal this Order Granting Final Approval of Class \nAction Settlement and Judgment, which appeal will delay the distribution ofthe Settlement to the Class, \nlJe  j)£,-\nr~  I 7:J~ \nshall post a bond with this Court in th amount of $  .  ~ \n37.  Out of a total of29, 603 Class Members, only four obj ections were submitted. Mr. Johnny Vela \nand Mr. Ronald Fuller object to the settlement because they believe it does not provide them with \nsufficient compensation. Mr. Sterling Allen objects to the Class definition. Ms. Virginia Cooks, though \ncounsel, objects to the adequacy ofthe notice of the settlement fund, the Class Members' expectation \nof benefits, incentive rewards for class representatives, the propriety of attorneys' fees request, and to \nthe presence of a reverter and a bond requirement.  Having considered each objection, the Court finds \nthat each argument is without merit. \n10 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 128   Filed 01/12/11   Page 11 of 11\n• \n38.

CIVIL ACTION SA-07-CV-928-FB \n§ \n§ \n§ \nTHE COUNTY OF BEXAR \n§ \nOn  November  15,  2007,  Plaintiffs  filed  their  Class  Action  Complaint  (hereafter \n\"Complaint\") alleging the Bexar County Adult Detention Center had a practice and policy which \nviolated 42 U.S.C.  §1983 and their constitutional rights by strip searching all pre-trial detainees \narrested on misdemeanor charges although there was no individualized suspicion of contraband. \nDefendant agreed to a Consent Decree granting Permanent Injunctive relief to Plaintiffs, dated \nApril 2, 2009 (Docket 63) (\"Consent Decree\"). \nIn the Consent Decree, Plaintiffs and Defendant consented to the entry of a Final Judgment \non the claim for permanent injunctive relief pleaded as the Third Cause of Action of the Complaint \n(hereafter \"Claim for Injunctive Relief\"), without demanding or requiring the adjudication of any \nissue of fact or law, pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decree. \nOn April  2, 2012,  the United States  Supreme  Court in Florence v.

Ct.  1510 (2012) issued an opinion directly on point \nwith  the  matters  and  claims  in  controversy  in  the  instant  case  and  found  there  was  no \nConstitutional violation of the prisoner's rights.  Specifically, the Court in Florence held that \n1665495v.1 IMANAGE 105645 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 181   Filed 01/28/13   Page 2 of 5\nunder the Fourth  Amendment, jail administrators may require  all  arrestees committed to the \ngeneral population of a jail to undergo no-touch visual strip searches, even if the arrest was for a \nminor offense and even  in the  absence  of reasonable  suspicion that  an arrestee  possesses a \nconcealed weapon or other contraband.  Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1523. \nDespite the entry of the Judgment and Consent Decree, the Court still retains jurisdiction \nover this matter as the Final Settlement provided for continuing jurisdiction until all settlement \npayments  were distributed to potential  Class members,  The Final Settlement provided  for a \ndeposit to the Inmate Commissary Fund of all unclaimed funds and that all amounts paid into the \nsettlement fund that were not needed based on the number of persons qualifying to participate \nrould revert to Bexar County.  All settlement proceeds have not been distributed, \nOn or about August 31, 2011, the Office of the Attorney General of Texas (\"OAG\") filed \nits First Amended Notice of Child Support Liens and Claim for Relief.  (Docket 179)  In sum, \nthe  OAG  claimed  a  lien  (liens)  over  various settlement  proceeds  for  the  payment of class \nmembers'  unpaid  child  support  obligations.  These  settlement  proceeds  have  not  all  been \ndistributed or paid, or were paid to the QAG for various costs, fines and fees, \nBased upon this significant change in the law, it is hereby agreed upon by the Plaintiffs and \nDefendant, and ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED by the Court, as follows: \n1.

The defendant, \nBexar County (\"Defendant\"), does not oppose the filing of this Motion for Preliminary Approval \nof Class Action Settlement and Brief in Support Thereof. 1 \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nIn a Settlement Agreement2 executed on August 5, 2010, a true and correct copy of which \nis attached hereto as Exhibit A,  Class Counsel (Charles J. LaDuca and Alexandra C. Warren of \nCuneo Gilbert &  LaDuca LLP, Washington, DC; Sam H. Lock ofthe Law Offices of Sam H. \nLock, San Antonio, Texas; Elmer Robert Keach, III of the Law Offices of Elmer Robert Keach, \nIII, P.C., Amsterdam, New York; Gary E. Mason and Nicholas Migliaccio ofMason LLP, \nWashington, DC; Kerrisa Chelkowski of the Law Office ofKerrisa Chelkowski, San Antonio, \nTexas; and Jim Harrington of the Texas Civil Rights Project, Austin Texas)3 and Bexar County \nand have secured a proposed settlement (the \"Settlement\") that provides a fair, reasonable and \nadequate benefit to individuals admitted to the Bexar County Adult Detention Center (the \n\"Detention Center\") who were subjected to strip and/or visual cavity searches upon entry to the \nfacility, regardless of the nature of offense or the presence of individualized reasonable \nsuspicion.  The Settlement creates a settlement fund of between $3,000,000 and $5,500,000 for \n1  Defendant  continues  to  deny  liability  and  damages  for  its  alleged  actions  or  inactions. \nDefendant has agreed to the attached settlement agreement. \n2 \nThe following documents are attached as exhibits to the Settlement Agreement: Exhibit A \n(Claim Form), Exhibit B (Long Form Notice), Exhibit C (Final Approval Order [Proposed]), \nExhibit D (Preliminary Approval ·order [Proposed]), Exhibit E (Short Form Notice), Exhibit F \n(Plan of Distribution), Exhibit G (Subclass Misdemeanor Offense Listing). \n3 Class Counsel's firm resumes are attached hereto as Exhibit B. \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 11 of 40\nthe benefit of in excess of approximately 29,400 Class Members.  See LaDuca Cert. at ,-r 9.  The \nspecifics of this relief are set forth in a Plan of Distribution, a true and correct copy of which is \nattached to the Settlement Agreement as Exhibit F. \nThis beneficial Settlement was reached over two and a half years after the filing of this \ncase and represents an efficient and salutary result for the Class on a claim that could have faced \ndifficulties at trial, and which was obtained from a defendant with a circumscribed ability to pay. \nBy virtue of the work of mediator Michael Curry, Esq., the parties were able to engage in \nnumerous arm's-length negotiation sessions that took place over the course of two years and \nwere aided in their positions by virtue of an efficient exchange of information relative to the \nmerits of the case.  The parties' good-faith efforts to resolve this litigation ultimately resulted in a \nsettlement representing a thoughtful compromise, which takes into consideration the parties \nrespective concerns-- a meaningful solution to the constitutional violations incurred by the \nmembers ofthe class and the County's financial status. \nIn short, Plaintiffs respectfully submit that this Settlement is fair, adequate, and \nreasonable for the Class and that the requirements for final approval will be satisfied. In \nconsidering preliminary approval, this is all that the moving party needs to demonstrate in order \nfor class members to be notified of this settlement and for a fairness hearing to be scheduled. \nFinally, Plaintiffs request that, along with granting preliminarily approval of the \nSettlement, the Court adopt the schedule set forth below, for the parties to effectuate the various \nsteps in the settlement approval process under the Settlement Agreement: \nEvent  Timinl( \n1  !Notice Date  No more than forty-five ( 45) days after \nPreliminary Settlement Approval Date. \n2  Deadline for filing Requests for  Forty-five (45) days after Notice Date. \nExclusion \n3  Deadline for filing Objections  Forty-five ( 45) days after Notice Date. \n2 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 12 of 40\n4  Fairness Hearing  !Approximately One Hundred and Twenty (120) \n~ays after Notice Date. \n5  End of Claims Period  One Hundred and Twenty (120) days after \nNotice Date. \nAccordingly, at this preliminary stage of the settlement process, Plaintiffs respectfully \nrequest that the Court: (i) grant preliminary approval of the proposed settlement; (ii) schedule a \nfinal fairness hearing to consider final approval, pursuant to the schedule set forth above; (iii) \ndirect that notice of the proposed settlement and hearing be provided to absent class members in \na manner consistent with the Settlement Agreement and the Notice Plan, as set forth in the \nabove-mentioned schedule; and (iv) enter the proposed Order for Preliminary Approval. \nII.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND OF CASE \nOn November 15, 2007, Plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit against Bexar County \n(\"Defendant\") regarding the Bexar County Adult Detention Center's strip search policies and \n4 \npractices.  LaDuca Cert. at ~2. \nSignificant discovery was completed.  In addition to written discovery exchanged \nbetween the parties, Plaintiffs deposed Col. Earl Griffin, Bexar County's Rule 30(b)(6) designee, \nas well as nine other Detention Center Officers Defendant, while Defendant deposed each of the \nthree named plaintiffs.  LaDuca Cert. at ~3. \nThe parties attended a first mediation session with Michael Curry, Esq., on November 21-\n22, 2008, but were not able to resolve the case.  Discovery continued.  LaDuca Cert. at ~4. \nFrom March 31-April 1, 2009, the parties attended a second mediation session with Mr. \nCurry.  As a result of their negotiations, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Enter Consent Decree \n4 The original Complaint named Julia Ann Jackson as the plaintiff.  Plaintiffs filed an Amended \nComplaint on August 6, 2008 adding Martin Martinez and Erica Bernal as plaintiffs.  Dkt. 46.  A \nSecond Amended Complaint was filed on November 16, 2009.  Dkt. 92. \n3 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 13 of 40\non March 31,2009.  Dkt. 62.  The Consent Decree, which resolved Plaintiffs' claims for \ninjunctive relief, was entered by the Court on April2, 2009.  Dkt. 63.  Due in part to the \nCounty's coverage dispute with its insurance carriers, the parties were not able to reach an \nagreement as to a complete settlement at that time.  LaDuca Cert. at ~5. \nSince Plaintiffs' claims for class-wide damages remained unresolved, the parties \ncontinued to litigate the case.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on June 4, 2009, \nDkt. 74-7.  After class certification motion was fully briefed in July of2009, the parties \ncontinued to discuss the possibility of settlement and attended a final mediation session on \nNovember 2-3, 2009.  The parties spent extensive time continuing their negotiations after the \nconclusion of the mediation and, on April 6, 2010, the parties executed a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding regarding the settlement of this case.  LaDuca Cert. at ~6. \nThe Settlement Agreement was executed on August 5, 2010.  LaDuca Cert. at ~7. In \nconnection with the execution of the Agreement, the parties prepared for the administration of \nthe settlement, and drafted the class notices and other papers that are part of and attached to the \nSettlement Agreement.  Through the mediation sessions and under the auspices of Mr. Curry, \nPlaintiffs learned that Bexar County had limited resources to fund a settlement in this matter. \nLaDuca Cert. at~ 8.  Plaintiffs believe that the monetary amount obtained for the benefit of \nClass Members through the Settlement Agreement represents the limit of Bexar County's ability \nto pay.  LaDuca Cert. at \n~8. \nIII.  BRIEF FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF CASE \nPlaintiffs claim that Bexar County maintained a strip search policy and practice \nthroughout the class period, pursuant to which all newly admitted pre-trial detainees, including \nthose admitted on misdemeanor offenses, were subjected to a strip search, often in a group \n4 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 14 of 40\nsetting, after being transported to the Bexar County Adult Detention Center.  It is Plaintiffs' \nposition that this policy and practice applied all detainees, without regard to the existence of \nreasonable suspicion to believe that they were concealing contraband.  Plaintiffs believe in some \ninstances this action constituted an assault or threat of assault. \nIV.  THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT5 \nPlaintiffs are pleased to present this application for preliminary approval of the settlement \nof this litigation to the Court. This Settlement is made on behalf of all persons brought to the \nBexar County Adult Detention Center after being charged with misdemeanor offenses (or other \nminor crimes) and were subsequently strip searched upon their entry into the facility. The Class \nis defined in the Settlement as: \nAll  pre-trial  detainees  confined to  the  Bexar  County  Adult  Detention  Center \nbetween November 15, 2005 and April 9, 2009, who were subjected to a strip \nsearch  before  being  sent  to jail housing  after being  booked on misdemeanor \ncharge(s).  Specifically excluded from the class are pre-trial detainees who were \nsubjected to strip search before being sent to jail housing after being booked on a \nfelony charge, or a felony charge and misdemeanor charge. \nThe Settlement Class includes the following two subclasses: \nSubclass I:  All persons in the Settlement Class, not in Subclass II. \nSubclass II:  All persons in the Settlement Class who were admitted on \nmisdemeanor charges of narcotics, shoplifting and weapons violations. \nThe misdemeanor offenses which qualify as those constituting charges of narcotics, \nshoplifting and weapons violations are defined by the parties in Exhibit G to the Settlement \nAgreement. \n5 If there is a conflict in the phrasing of the statements in this motion, as opposed ot the executed \nAugust 3, 2010 Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Agreement controls. \n5 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 15 of 40\nAs described below, the Settlement Agreement provides for the creation of a fund to \ncompensate class members for these constitutional violations. \nA.  The Settlement Fund \nThe Settlement creates a fund of between $3,000,000 and $5,500,000 (the \"Settlement \nFund\").  The Settlement is structured so that an initial contribution of $250,000 will be made \nwithin 30 days of the entry of a preliminary approval order.  After final approval, and no later \nthan 10 days after the Effective Date, the sum of$1,750,000 will be provided by Bexar \nCounty's primary insurance carriers.  The timing of additional contributions to the Settlement \nFund will depend upon Bexar County's resolution of a coverage dispute with its excess \n.  . \nmsurance earners. \nIt is Bexar County's position that its excess carriers should contribute an additional $3.5 \nmillion towards the Settlement, which would result in a total Settlement of $5.5 million.  Bexar \nCounty has filed litigation to resolve this coverage dispute with its excess carriers.  In the event \nthat the coverage dispute is not resolved by 30 days after the Effective Date, or the coverage \ndispute is resolved against Bexar County prior to the Effective Date, Bexar County will pay the \nsum of $1 million into the Settlement Fund.  Thus, in no event will the Settlement Fund be less \nthan $3 million. \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that if Bexar County recovers funds from its excess \ncarriers, the money will first be used to reimburse litigation expenses in connection with the \ninsurance coverage litigation.  If Bexar County has not made a contribution into the Settlement \nFund, all remaining funds will be paid to the Settlement Fund.  If Bexar County has made a \ncontribution to the Settlement Fund, then one half ofthe sums recovered from its excess carriers \nshall be paid to Bexar County until it recovers the sums it paid and the other half, after payment \n6 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 16 of 40\noflitigation expenses incurred in connection with Bexar County's insurance coverage litigation, \nshall be paid into the Settlement Fund.  Further details regarding the distribution of funds is set \nforth in Section 3 of the Settlement Agreement. \nAll administrative expenses, including the costs of settlement administration, website \nadministration and the provision of notice to class members, as well as the amount awarded by \nthe Court for attorneys' fees and costs and incentive awards to the class representatives, will be \ndeducted from the Settlement Fund prior to determining the amount of distribution for class \nmembers.  The exact amount of recovery to each class member, and the timing of such \ndistribution(s), will be determined by the Plan of Distribution. \nSubclass I will receive all of the distribution amount from the Settlement Fund after \nabove-mentioned amounts are deducted, except that an additional $100,000 will be deducted to \nfund Subclass II.  Each Class Member within Subclass I who submits a timely Claim Form will \nreceive a pro rata share of the fund, except that the maximum payment to members of Subclass \nI will be $1,000.  Members of Subclass II, in tum, will receive their pro rata share of the \n$100,000 Subclass II fund, except that their maximum payment will be $100.  If a pro rata \ndistribution of the Settlement Fund to members of Subclass II results in funds remaining in the \nSettlement Fund for Subclass II, those remaining funds will be transferred to the Settlement \nFund for Subclass I for distribution.  Then, if the pro rata share of the Settlement paid to \nmembers of Subclass I would be greater than $1,000, Defendant will receive a reverter ofthe \nremaining funds.  If members of Subclass I or Subclass II have unpaid court ordered fines, fees, \ncosts of court, or restitution ordered by a Bexar county Judge, the amount owed will be \nsubtracted from any payment, with the maximum of any such payment being one-half of that \n7 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 17 of 40\nClass Member's payment, capped at $500.00 for Subclass I Members, and $50.00 for Subclass \nII Members. \nB.  Class Notice and Settlement Administration \nBoth the Class Notice and Settlement Administration provided for in the Settlement \nAgreement comport with the requirements of applicable law, Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure and due process. First, all costs associated with publishing notice to the class \nmembers and the administration of the Settlement shall be deducted directly from the settlement \namount before determining the distribution to the Class. Second, notice will be provided to the \nClass by direct mailing of the Long Form Notice, Short Form Notice and Claim Form, true and \ncorrect copies of which are attached to the Settlement Agreement as Exhibits B, E, and A, \nrespectively, to all individuals at their last known or readily ascertainable address (in both \nSpanish and English) and by publication in the major English and Spanish newspapers in San \nAntonio on at least one day per week for three consecutive weeks commencing on the Notice \ndate, and on one occasion during the last ten days of the Claims Period.  The mailed notice will \nbe provided in Spanish and English, and newspaper advertisements will provide instruction that \na Spanish copy of the notice will be provided upon request.  Notice will also be provided to the \nclass by way of a limited televised notice campaign on cable television, as well as a radio \ncampmgn. \nC.  Attorneys' Fees and Class Representative Incentive Awards \nClass Counsel will petition the Court for reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses payable \nfrom the Settlement Fund. The Settlement Agreement currently provides that Class Counsel will \n8 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 18 of 40\nseek attorneys' fees and expenses in an amount together not to exceed thirty percent of the total \nSettlement Fund. \nClass Counsel will also petition the Court for incentive awards on behalf of Julia Ann \nJackson, Martin Martinez, and Erica Bernal, in the amount of$15,000 each. \nV.  The Settlement Agreement Should Be Preliminarily Approved By the Court \nIn this motion, Plaintiffs seek preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement between \nPlaintiffs and Defendant.  \"Compromises of disputed claims are favored by the courts.\" \nWilliams v. First Nat'! Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595 (1910). Settlement spares the litigants the \nuncertainty, delay and expense of a trial, while simultaneously reducing the burden on judicial \nresources.  Federal Rule 23(e) provides that the Court must approve any settlement of a class \naction.  The ultimate determination whether a proposed class action settlement warrants \napproval resides in the Court's discretion. Protective Comm. for Indep. S'holders ofTMT Trailer \nFerry, Inc. v. Anderson, 390 U.S. 414, 424-25 (1968). As discussed more fully below, at this \nstage of preliminary approval, there is clear evidence that the Settlement Agreement is well \nwithin the range of possible approval and thus should be preliminarily approved. \nA.  The Standards and Procedures for Preliminary Approval \nRule 23(e) ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the mechanism for settling a \nclass action, including, as here, through a class certified for settlement purposes: \nThe claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class may be settled, voluntarily \ndismissed, or compromised only with the court's approval. The following \nprocedures apply to a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise: \n(1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to \nall class members who would be bound by the proposal. \n(2) If the proposal would bind class members, the court may \n9 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 19 of 40\napprove it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, \nreasonable, and adequate. \n(3) The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying \nany agreement made in connection with the proposal. \n(4) Ifthe class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), \nthe court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a new \nopportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who \nhad an earlier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so. \n(5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires \ncourt approval under this subdivision (e); the objection may be \nwithdrawn only with the court's approval. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e); Amchem Prods. v.  Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997). \nIn determining whether preliminary approval is warranted, the sole issue before the Court \nis whether the proposed settlement is within the range of what might be found fair, reasonable \nand adequate, so that notice of the proposed settlement should be given to class members, and a \nhearing scheduled to consider final approval.  The Court reviews the proposal preliminarily to \ndetermine whether it is sufficient to warrant public notice and a hearing.  If so, the final decision \non approval is made after the hearing.

The Court is not required at this point to \nmake a final determination: \nThe judge must make a preliminary determination on the fairness, \nreasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement terms and must direct the \npreparation of notice ofthe certification, proposed settlement, and date of \nthe final fairness hearing. \n!d. at § 21.632, at 321.  Preliminary approval is the first step in a two-step process required \nbefore a class action may be finally settled.  !d. at 320.  Courts first make a preliminary \nevaluation of the fairness of the settlement, prior to notice.  !d. at 320-21.  In some cases this \ninitial assessment can be made on the basis of information already known to the court and then \n10 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 20 of 40\nsupplemented by briefs, motions and an informal presentation from the settling parties.  Id. \nThere is an initial strong presumption that a proposed class action settlement is fair and \nreasonable when it is the result of arm's length negotiations.  In deciding whether a settlement \nshould be approved under Rule 23, Courts look to whether there is a basis to believe that the \nmore rigorous, final approval standard will be satisfied.  \"Once the judge is satisfied as to the \ncertifiability of the class and the results of the initial inquiry into the fairness, reasonableness, \nand adequacy of the settlement, notice of a formal Rule 23( e) fairness hearing is given to the \nclass members.\" Manual Fourth at§ 21.633, at 321.  Preliminary approval permits notice ofthe \nhearing on final settlement approval to be given to the class members, at which time class \nmembers and the settling parties may be heard with respect to final approval.  Id. at 322. \nB.  The Settlement is Fair, Reasonable and Adequate \nThe standards for preliminary approval of a settlement \"are not as stringent as those \napplied to a motion for final approval ... If the proposed settlement discloses no reason to doubt \nits fairness, has no obvious deficiencies, does not improperly grant preferential treatment to class \nrepresentatives or segments of the class, does not grant excessive compensation to attorneys, and \nappears to fall within the range of possible approval, the court should grant preliminary \napproval.\"  In re OCA, Inc. Securities and Derivative Litig., 2008 WL 4681369, *11 (E.D. La. \nOct. 17, 2008) (citations omitted).  In deciding whether there is good cause to issue notice to the \nclass and to proceed with a fairness hearing, the district court must determine that \"the proposed \nsettlement appears to be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations, has no \nobvious deficiencies, does not improperly grant preferential treatment to class representatives or \nsegments of the class, and falls within the range of possible [judicial] approval.\" In re Shell Oil \nRefinery, 155 F.R.D. 552, 555 (E.D. La. 1993) (citing Manual for Complex Litigation, Second§ \n30.44 (Federal Judicial Center, 1985)); see also, Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on \n11 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 21 of 40\nClass Actions, §§ 11.24-11.25 (3rd ed. 1992); In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., 643 \nF.2d 195,212 (5th Cir.1981). \n1.  The Proposed Settlement is the Product of Serious, Informed, \nNon-Collusive Negotiations \nThis Settlement is the result of arm's-length negotiations, conducted by experienced \ncounsel for all parties. \nThis consideration is often shaped by the experience and reputation of counsel. Dehoyos \nv. Allstate Corp., 2006 WL 2329417, * 1 (W.D. Tex. June 2, 2006) (Biery, J.) (preliminary \napproval of settlement where \"counsel for all Parties have significant experience in litigating and \nnegotiating settlements of cases involving allegations of racial discrimination\"); In re OCA, 2008 \nWL 4681369, *11; McNamara v. Bre-X Minerals Ltd., 214 F.R.D. 424, 430-31(E.D. Tex. 2002); \nCotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1332-33 (5th Cir. 1977); In re Coordinated Pretrial \nProceedings in Antibiotic Antitrust Actions, 410 F.Supp. 659, 667 (D.Minn. 1974) (\"The \nrecommendation of experienced antitrust counsel is entitled to great weight.\"); Fisher Brothers \nv. Phelps Dodge Industries, Inc., 604 F. Supp. 446, 452 (E.D. Pa. 1985) (\"The professional \njudgment of counsel involved in the litigation is entitled to significant weight.\"). \nThe Settlement was negotiated on behalf of Plaintiffs by a team of attorneys who have \nbeen vigorously prosecuting this and parallel cases for similar claims and were, therefore, well \nversed in the issues and how to evaluate the claims.  This Settlement meets all the requirements \nof Rule 23 and is designed to provide administrative procedures to assure all Class Members' \nequal and sufficient due process rights. The parties conducted extensive discovery and research \nto ensure that all negotiations were informed.  Class Counsel believe in the merits of this case \nand were willing and able to litigate the claims at issue in the event Bexar County failed to agree \nto a significant and valuable settlement agreement.  The Settlement was agreed to after \n12 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 22 of 40\nconsidering all key factors, including the range of judgments that would likely be obtained by \nClass members, the risk that judgments could be reversed or delayed by appeals, the time \nrequired to litigate this case through trial, and Defendant's financial situation.  Accordingly, the \nsettlement was not the product of collusive dealings, but, rather, was informed by the vigorous \nprosecution of the case by the experienced and qualified counsel. \n2.  The Proposed Settlement Has No Obvious Deficiencies \nThe Settlement provides valuable consideration to pretrial detainees who were strip \nsearched absent reasonable suspicion and addresses the problem at the heart of Plaintiffs' claims. \nThere are no deficiencies.  See In re OCA, 2008 WL 4681369, *11. \n3.  The Proposed Settlement Does not Improperly Grant \nPreferential Treatment to Class Representatives or Segments \nof the Class \nThe economic terms of the settlement are fair.  The proposed Settlement does not unduly \ngrant preferential treatment to the proposed Class Representative or to segments of the \nSettlement Class, and it does not provide excessive compensation to counsel. \nOther than an incentive award in recognition of their considerable participation in this \nlitigation-including being deposed and participating in drafting responses to Defendant's \ndiscovery requests - the settlement accords no special treatment whatsoever to Class \nRepresentatives. \nThe Settlement Agreement provides for the certification of two Subclasses.  Subclass I \nconsists of all persons admitted to the Bexar County Adult Detention Center during the proposed \nclass period who are not members of Subclass II.  Subclass II consists of all persons in the \nSettlement Class who were admitted on misdemeanor charges of narcotics, shoplifting and \nweapons violations.  Members of Subclass I are expected to receive higher distributions than \n13 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 23 of 40\nmembers of Subclass II.  Members of the subclasses are compensated differently because, while \nClass Counsel believes that it is clear under Fifth Circuit precedent that blanket strip searches of \npersons arrested on minor offenses absent reasonable suspicion are improper, the case law also \nsuggests that individuals arrested on offenses involving charges of narcotics, shoplifting, and \nweapons violations may be constitutionally strip searched.  See Watt v. Richardson Police \nDepartment, 849 F.2d 195, 199 (5th Cir. 1988) (policy of strip searching arrestees detained on \nweapons, shoplifting, or narcotics charges not invalidated).  Thus, a different allocation is \nappropriate.  See e.g. In re OCA, 2008 WL 4681369, *12 (preliminary approval granted where \nallocation plan differentiated between class members based on when they purchased shares of \nstock); see also Boone v. City ofP  hiladelphia, 668 F.Supp. 2d 693 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (two \nsubclasses, with members of Subclass I receiving approximately $1,321 and members of \nSubclass II receiving $85). \n4.  The Proposed Settlement Falls Within the Range of Possible \nJudicial Approval \nAlthough the Court is only making a preliminary evaluation of the Settlement at this \npoint and need only evaluate the four criteria discussed above, the Court may also look at the \nfactors it will consider at the final fairness hearing on order to preliminarily assess whether the \nSettlement falls within the range of possible approval.  In the Fifth Circuit, courts consider the \nfollowing factors in assessing the fairness of a settlement:  (1) the existence of fraud or collusion \nbehind the settlement; (2) the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; (3) the \nstage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the probability of plaintiffs' \nsuccess on the merits; (5) the range of possible recovery; and (6) the opinions ofthe class \ncounsel, class representatives, and absent class members.\"  Reed v. Gen. Motors Corp., 703 F.2d \n170, 172 (5th Cir. 1983) (citations omitted); see also In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., \n14 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 24 of 40\n643 F.2d at 217.  As stated above, there was no fraud or collusion whatsoever involved in the \nnegotiation of the Settlement.  See LaDuca Cert. at ~8. \nGiven the nature of this case, continued litigation (up to and including trial and any \nappeals) will likely be complex, expensive, and lengthy.  A trial would last for weeks, with \nscores of Detention Center employees being examined about their search practices and numerous \nclass members appearing to testify regarding their experiences. \nThe parties are in the late stages of these proceedings and, as explained above, a \nsignificant amount of discovery has been conducted.  Written discovery was exchanged, many \ndepositions were completed, various discovery motions were filed, and motions for class \ncertification and to exclude expert testimony were fully briefed. \nThe range of possible recovery strongly supports approval of this Settlement because it \nprovides the Class with a significant package of relief.  Based on the data provided, Class \nCounsel estimates that there are approximately 23,520 members of Subclass I and 5,880 \nmembers of Subclass II.  The approximate pro rata share of the Settlement Fund assuming a \n20% claims rate and a total settlement of $5.5 million is $734 for members of Subclass I and $93 \nfor members of Subclass II.  The approximate pro rata share of the Settlement Fund assuming a \n20% claims rate and a total settlement of $3 million is $325 for members of Subclass I and $93 \nfor members of Subclass II.  The approximate pro rata share of the Settlement Fund assuming a \n15% claims rate and a total settlement of $5.5 million is $979 for members of Subclass I and \n$100 for members of Subclass II.  The approximate pro rata share of the Settlement Fund \nassuming a 15% claims rate and a total settlement of $3 million is $434 for members of Subclass \n15 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 25 of 40\nI and $100 for members of Subclass II. 6  This payment is quite fair and reasonable given the \ninherent risks of litigation, and awards in similar cases. 7  Class Members will receive \nmeaningful compensation for the damages they sustained. \nThe likely amount to be received by Class Members is fair and reasonable given the \ninherent risks of litigation and in light of settlement awards in similar cases.  See e.g. Boone, 668 \nF.Supp. 2d 693 (settlement award ranging from $85 to $1,321 depending upon subclass \nmembership); Reynolds v. County ofD  auphin, 1 :07 -cv-0 1688 (M.D. Pa.) (final approval of class \naction settlement paying victims of illegal strip searches approximately $600 each); Kurian v. \nCounty ofL ancaster, 07-cv-3482 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 1, 2009) (payments ranging from $50 to $900, \ndepending on claimants' classification in one of five categories); Doan v.  Watson, 2002 WL \n31730917 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 4, 2002) (approximately $1,000 per claimant); Kahler v.  County of \nRensselaer, No. 03-cv-1324 (N.D.N.Y. April28, 2004) (approximately $1,000 per claimant); \n6 These figures represent a rough approximation of the class size data and may be revised upon \nfurther review. \n7 The Ninth and Eleventh Circuits recently held that under certain circumstances blanket strip \nsearches of pretrial detainees are constitutional See Bull v. City and County ofS an Francisco, \n595 F.3d 964, 968 (91h Cir. 2010)(en banc)(finding that San Francisco's blanket strip search \npolicy was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment where the policy provided that searches \nmust be \"conducted in a professional manner in an area of privacy so that the search cannot be \nobserved by persons not participating in the search\"); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1314 \n(11th Cir. 2008)( en bane )(holding that rights of pretrial detainees placed in custodial housing \nwith the general jail population \"are not violated by a policy or practice of strip searching each \none of them as part of the booking process, provided that the searches are no more intrusive on \nprivacy interests than those upheld in the Bell case\" and the searches are \"not conducted in an \nabusive manner.\").  The Third Circuit is currently considering the issue.  See Florence v. Bd. Of \nChosen Freeholders ofB  urlington, 657 F.Supp.2d 504,508 n. 4 (D.N.J. 2009) (certifying the \nfollowing question for interlocatory appeal: \"whether a blanket policy of strip searching all non \nindictable arrestees admitted to a jail facility without first articulating reasonable suspicion \nviolates the Fourth Amendment to the united States Constitution as applied to the States through \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\").  Further, by Order dated October 30, 2009, a district court in the \nWestern District of Texas denied a motion for class certification in a strip search class action. \nSee Bradshaw, et al. v. McLennan County, et al., Case No. 6:08-cv-0026 (W.D. Tex.). \n16 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 26 of 40\nMcBean v. City ofN  ew York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 388 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (payments of$750 or \n$1,000, depending on number of strip searches). \nClass Counsel and all of the proposed Class Representatives support the Settlement. \nClass Counsel are unaware of any opposition from absent Class Members and anticipate that, \nonce the Settlement is preliminarily approved and notice is given to all Class Members, the \nsupport for the Settlement will far outweigh any opposition. \nC.  Certification of the Proposed Settlement Class is Appropriate to \nResolve All Strip Search Claims Against Defendant \nBoth the Supreme Court and various circuit courts have recognized the benefits of the \nproposed settlement can only be realized through the certification of a settlement class. See \nAmchem, 521 U.S. at 591; In re Prudential Ins. Co. America Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions \n(\"Prudential II\"), 148 F.3d 283, 283 (3d Cir. 1998); Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp.,  150 F.3d 1011 \n(91h Cir. 1998).  Rule 23's requirements apply when certification is for settlement purposes.  See \nAmchem, 521 U.S. 591; In re OCA, 2008 WL 4681369, *6. \nA case can be certified as a class action where a plaintiff demonstrates that the threshold \nrequirements of Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a) (numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy of \nrepresentation) are satisfied, and also demonstrates that the class satisfies one of three criteria set \nforth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b).  City of San Antonio v.  Hotels. com, 2008 WL 2486043, *3 (W.D. \nTex. May 27, 2008);  Vizena v.  Union Pacific Railroad Co., 360 F.3d 496, 502-503 (5th Cir. \n2004).  Other federal courts, in considering the situation where cities or counties have employed \nblanket strip search policies, have consistently recognized the propriety of certifying such cases \nas class actions and the decisions certifying such cases are legion. See e.g. Boone, 668 F.Supp.2d \n693 (granting final approval to strip search settlement); Bizzarro v.  County of Ocean, 2009 WL \n1617887 (D.N.J.

The Proposed Class Satisfies Rule 23(a)(l) \na.  Numerosity \nRule 23(a)(l) requires that the class be \"so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.\"  To satisfy the requirement, \"joinder need not be impossible, merely \nimpracticable.\" Bywaters v.  United States, 196 F.R.D. 458, 466 (E.D. Tex. 2000).  A plaintiff is \nnot required to detail, to the person, the exact size ofthe class or to demonstrate that joinder of \nall class members is impossible.  Carpenter v. Davis, 424 F.2d 257, 260 (5th Cir. 1970).  The \nFifth Circuit has held that though the number of class members alone is not determinative of \nwhether joinder is impracticable, a class consisting of 100 to 150 members is within the \"range \nthat generally satisfies the numerosity requirement.\" Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 \nF.3d 620, 624 (51h Cir. 1999). \nThe general rule encouraging liberal construction of civil rights class action \"applies with \nequal force to the numerosity requirement ofRule 23(a).\" Jones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d 1090, \n1100 (51h Cir. 1975).  Thus, courts, in applying the numerosity requirement, must consider \"the \nnature and intent of the Civil Rights Act, whose purpose is to provide a broad remedy for all who \nfit the plaintiffs class.\"  Id. \nGiven that the Settlement Class consists of approximately 29,400 individuals, there is no \nquestion that the element of numerosity has been met.  The booking records produced by Bexar \n19 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 29 of 40\nCounty confirm that thousands of individuals were arrested and detained in Bexar County Adult \nDetention Center facilities during the class period, and the numerosity requirement for \ncertification is easily satisfied. \nb.  Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be \"questions of law or fact common to the class.\"  The \ntest of commonality \"is not demanding.\"  Mullen, 186 F.3d at 625; Forbush v. JC. Penny Co., \n994 F.2d 1101, 1106 (5th Cir. 1993); JD. v. Nagin, 255 F.R.D. 414,414-15 (E.D. La. 2009). \nThe plaintiff need only show that there is one common question of law or fact; the interests and \nclaims of each plaintiff need not be identical.  James v. City ofD  allas, 254 F.3d 551,570 (5th \nCir. 2001); City ofS an Antonio, 2008 WL 2486043 at *5; Johnson v.  United States o.f America, \n208 F.R.D. 167-168 (W.D.T.X. 2001); I Newberg on Class Actions, §3:10 at 3-50; Johnson v. \nAmerican Credit Co. ofGeorgia, 581 F.2d 526, 532 (5th Cir. 1978). \nThe central issues posed by this litigation are whether Bexar County's search regimen \nconstitutes an unconstitutional blanket strip search policy and/or practice during the class period \nand whether Defendant is responsible for these constitutional violations.  Given the presence of \nthese common questions central to this litigation, Rule 23(a)(2)'s requirement of common \nquestions of fact or law is met.  See e.g. Dodge, 226 F .R.D. at 180-181 (commonality exists \nwhere all members of the class contend that a blanket strip search policy exists, where all \nmembers contend that the policy is illegal, and where all members of the class claim they were \nsearched pursuant to the policy which was uniformly applied to all detainees); Marriott, 227 \nF.R.D. at 172 (finding commonality where the representative parties and the members of the \nproposed class had the same legal claims based upon the same official procedure); see also \nSutton v. Hopkins County, 2007 WL 119892, *4 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, 2007) (\"Plaintiffs have \n20 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 30 of 40\nalleged that the Defendants had a policy, custom, or practice of strip-searching persons on \nadmission to and/or just prior to release from the Hopkins County Jail without regard to whether \nthere existed the requisite individual, reasonable suspicion required by law. Given this allegation, \nthe existence and constitutionality of the county's policy, custom or practice are common \nquestions.\"); Young v. County of Cook, 2007 WL 1238920 at *5 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 25, 2007) \n(\"Courts have consistently held that class actions challenging blanket strip search policies satisfy \nRule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement.\"). \nc.  Typicality \nRule 23(a)(3) also requires that the representative plaintiffs claims be \"typical\" of those \nof other class members.  The commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) \"tend to \nmerge.\"  Gen. Tel. Co. ofS outhwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.13 (1982).  The test \"is not \ndemanding\", Mullen, 186 F.3d at 625; Forbush, 994 F.2d at 1105; JD., 255 F.R.D. at 415, and \n\"focuses on the similarity between the named plaintiffs legal and remedial theories and the \ntheories of those whom they purport to represent.\"  Stirman v. Exxon Corp., 280 F.3d 554, 562 \n(5th Cir. 2002); James, 254 F.3d at 571. \"Typicality does not require a complete identity of \nclaims.\"  Stirman, 280 F.3d at 562; James, 254 F.3d at 571.  Instead, the question is whether the \nclass representative's claims have \"the same essential characteristics of the putative class.\" \nStirman, 280 F.3d at 562.  '\"Even relatively pronounced factual differences' between the \nindividual claims will not defeat typicality as long as the claims are woven from the same legal \nfabric and arise from the same event, practice or course of conduct.\" City ofS an Antonio, 2008 \nWL 2486043 at *6; Feder v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 429 F.3d 125, 129-130 (5th Cir. 2005). \nHere, the Representative Plaintiffs' claims against Defendant are typical of the claims of \nthe Class.  They arise from the same course of events and Plaintiffs must make the same \n21 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 31 of 40\narguments to prosecute their claims as would be made by the members of the proposed Class in \nany individual case.  There are no special or unique features of the named Plaintiffs' claims that \nmake them different in any fundamental way from those of other Class members.  Typicality is \nsatisfied because the Defendant \"acted pursuant to a policy that called for indiscriminate \nsearches. If this allegation is true, then the named [P]laintiffs would be similarly situated to the \nother members of the class.\" Blihovde, 29 F.R.D. at 617; Bowers v. City ofP  hiladelphia, 2006 \nWL 2818501 *2-3 (E.D.Pa. 2006) (\"A plaintiffs claim is typical if it arises from the same event \nor course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and is based on the \nsame legal theory.\"); see also Weisfeld v. Sun Chern. Corp., 210 F.R.D. 136, 140 (D.N.J. 2002) \n(\"[I]n instances wherein it is alleged that the defendants engaged in a common scheme relative to \nall members of the class there is a strong assumption that the claims of the representative parties \nwill be typical ofthe absent class members.\")(citation omitted); Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 172 \n(finding typicality even where the claims of the representative parties involved a more detailed \nsearch than other class members, because they were conducted pursuant to the same policy); \nSutton, 2007 WL 117892 at *4 (\"Because each named Plaintiff alleges an unconstitutional strip \nsearch after arrest for a minor violation or before release from jail, the claims of the \nrepresentatives are typical of the class as a whole.\"). \nd.  Adequacy \nRule 23(a)( 4) requires the class representative to \"fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class.\"  \"To satisfy this requirement, the interests of the class representative must \nnot conflict with the interests of the putative class, and class counsel must be able to competently \nrepresent the class.\"  City ofS an Antonio, 2008 WL 2486043 at *7.  When evaluating whether \nthe interests of the class will be adequately represented by the class representative and class \n22 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 32 of 40\ncounsel, a court must consider the zeal and competence of the representative's counsel and the \nwillingness and ability of the representative to take an active role in and control the litigation and \nto protect the interests of absentees. Stirman, 280 F.3d at 563; Feder, 429 F.3d 125, 129-130. \nPlaintiffs and Class Counsel have fairly and adequately represented the Class here, \nespecially judging by the excellent settlement achieved in this litigation. Class Counsel are \ncompetent and experienced attorneys who have invested considerable time and resources into the \nprosecution of this action and who have extensive experience in successfully litigating various \nforms of class actions (including strip search class actions)  and other complex matters, including \nstrip search cases around the country.  (LaDuca Cert. Ex.2, Firm Resumes). \nThe adequacy of the representation element is satisfied if the named plaintiffs interests \nare \"sufficiently aligned with those of other class members.\" Jenkins v. Raymark Industries, \nInc., 109 F.R.D. 269,273 (E.D. Tex. 1985).  Stated differently, as long as \"all class members are \nunited in asserting a common right, such as achieving the maximum possible recovery for the \nclass, the class interest are not antagonistic for representative purposes.\" San Antonio Hispanic \nPolice Officers' Organization, Inc. v. City ofS an Antonio, 188 F.R.D. 433, 444 (W.D. Tex. \n1999).  Here, the Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit to put and end to blanket strip searches at Bexar \nCounty's facilities and are committed to obtaining appropriate compensation from Defendant for \nthemselves and the members of the proposed Settlement Class.  See JD., 255 F.R.D. at 416 \n(adequacy met where the claims of the named and unnamed plaintiffs rested \"upon the practices \nand policies of the uuvenile detention center] as a whole, and as such apply to both named and \nunmade class members alike\").  Plaintiffs' interests in this case coincide with those of potential \nClass members in that Plaintiffs seek compensation for victims of Bexar County's strip search \npolicy, as they have already succeeded in changing Bexar County's strip search policies going \n23 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 33 of 40\nforward.  Because Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of the members of the proposed \nClass, their interests are aligned with those of the Class. \nWith respect to the conflicts issue, there are none.  Indeed, the claims of the Plaintiffs, far \nfrom conflicting with the Class, are identical to the Class and are based on the same factual and \nlegal issues.  Bertulli v. Independent Ass 'n ofCnteniental Pilots, 242 F.3d 290, 299 (5th Cir. \n2001) (adequacy satisfied where plaintiffs share the same theories of liability and the class \nrepresentatives' interest are aligned with, not antagonist to, the unnamed class members.). \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs are adequate representatives and have retained experienced class \ncounsel that has aggressively litigated this case. \n2.  The Requirements of Rule 23(b )(3) Are Met in the Settlement \nContext \na.  Common Issues Predominate \nRule 23(b)(3) requires that the party proposing a class action establish that issues \ncommon to the class predominate over the individual issues of particular class members.  See \nAmchem Prod., 521 U.S. at 591, 623.  The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry \"tests whether \nproposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\"  Id.  \"In \norder to predominate, common issues must constitute a significant part of the individual cases.\" \nMullen, 186 F.3d at 626; O'Sullivan v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 319 F.3d 732,742 (5th \nCir. 2003). \nThis analysis requires an examination of relative significance or weight of the issues, and \nwhether the issues are likely to become a major focus of the litigation.  City ofS an Antonio, 2008 \nWL 2486043 at *6; Mullen, 186 F.3d at 626.  The most pragmatic way for the court to make this \ndetermination is to evaluate whether \"common or 'generalized' proof, as opposed to individual \n24 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 34 of 40\nproof' will predominate at trial.  City ofS an Antonio, 2008 WL 2486043 at *9.  In other words, \n\"the court should ask whether the 'addition or subtraction of plaintiffs to or from the class will \nhave a substantial effect on the substance or quality ofthe evidence offered.\"' !d. at *9 (citation \nomitted).  If the claims \"would require generalized or common proof, then a class action would \ncertainly be the most efficient method oflitigating the claims.\" !d.  Moreover, the common \nquestions need not be dispositive of all issues.  See 7B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & \nMary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1778 (2d ed.1986).  When one or more of \nthe central issues in the action \"are common to the class and can be said to predominate, the \naction will be considered proper ... even though other important matters will have to be tried \nseparately.\" !d. \nHere, the proposed Class Members' claims involve one central legal issue: was Bexar \nCounty's policy of strip searching every pretrial detainee admitted to the facility constitutional \nwhere these detainees are made to disrobe in the presence of a Detention Officer absent any \nconsideration of the crime charged or the circumstances of the arrest?  Plaintiffs' claims also \nshare common factual issues-did such practices exist during the Class period?  Proof of these \nclass wide issues would be the focus of any trial.  Thus, the legal and factual issues relating to \nthe strip search policy in this litigation predominate over any of the individual issues. \nb.  Superiority \nIn addition to proving predominance, a plaintiff in a 23(b )(3) case must also show that a \nclass action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the \ncontroversy.  Class actions are considered superior when individual actions would be wasteful, \nduplicative, present managerial difficult and are adverse to judicial economy. Mullen, 186 F .3d \nat 627.  Courts also consider whether class treatment of a case will \"achieve economics of time, \n25 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 35 of 40\neffort and expense, and promote uniformity of decisions as to persons similarly situated without \nsacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.\" Id.; Henry v. Cash \nToday, Inc., 199 F.R.D. 566, 570 (S.D. Tex. 2000); State ofA  labama v. Blue Bird Body Co., Inc., \n573 F.2d 309, 315 (5th Cir. 1978).  This is because to require hundreds or thousands of identical \nindividual, repetitive cases to be filed to address the claims in this- all with the attendant \npossibility of inconsistent adjudications-verges on absurd.  See Califano v.  Yamaski, 442 U.S. \n683, 700-01 ( 1979); see also In re First Republic Bank Sec. Litig., Nos. 3-88-0641-H and 3-88-\n1251-H, 1989 WL 108795 *15 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 1, 1989) (\"any administrative difficulties in \nhandling this class action are preferable to duplicating judicial resources in several individual \nlawsuits and denying access to the courts for class members.\").  In fact, the class action devise is \ndesigned for this very situation where an individual seeks to vindicate \"the rights of groups of \npeople who individually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents into court \nat all.\" Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 617.  \"The policy at the very core of the class action \nmechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any \nindividual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights. A class action solves this problem \nby aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone's (usually \nan attorney's) labor.\"  !d. \nHere, the identity of the factual and legal issues between all proposed Class Members \nmakes the notion that they should be required to file hundreds or thousands of individual \nlawsuits illogical, and forcing them to do so would encourage a waste of judicial and private \nresources.  All Class Members' claims arise from the same course of conduct and are based upon \nthe same legal theories.  Resolution of these claims will affect each member similarly, and it \nwould be economically prohibitive for many Class Members who suffered smaller losses to \n26 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 36 of 40\nprosecute individual actions.  The prosecution of this case as a class action is superior to \nthousands of individual cases being filed in this Court, each of which would be repetitious, \npossibly yield inconsistent results, and would be onerous on the limited resources of the Court. \nSee Califano, 42 U.S. 682, 700-70; Dodge, 226 F.R.D. at 183; Sutton, 2007 WL 119892, *9. \nThere are no overlapping cases pending in any other jurisdiction.  A class action is the superior \nmethod to prosecute this action. \nVI.  The Court Should Direct Notice to the Class \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), class members are entitled to notice of any proposed \nsettlement before it is ultimately approved by the Court. Manual for Complex Litigation Third \n(Federal Judicial Center, 1995) §30.212.  \"The notice must 'contain an adequate description of \nthe proceedings written in objective, neutral terms that, insofar as possible, may be understood \nby the average absentee class member,\"' McNamara, 214 F.R.D. at 432 (quoting In re Nissan \nMotor Corp. Antitrust Litig., 552 F.2d 1088, 1103 (51h Cir. 1977)), and \"'must contain \ninformation that a reasonable person would consider to be material in making an informed, \nintelligent decision of whether to opt out or remain a member of the class and be bound by the \nfinal judgment.\"' !d. (quoting In re Nissan Motor Corp. Antitrust Litig., 552 F.2d at 11 05); see \nalso In re OCA, 2008 WL 4681368, *15.  The Settlement Agreement provides for reasonable \nnotice to prospective Class Members in that it requires notice to be provided by mail, newspaper, \ntelevision, radio, and the Internet. \nUnder Rule 23( e) and the relevant due process considerations, adequate notice must be \ngiven to all absent class members and potential class members to enable them to make an \nintelligent choice as to whether to opt-out of the class. Prudential IL  148 F.3d at 326-27; \nValentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227 (9th Cir. 1996). However, neither Rule 23 nor \n27 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 37 of 40\ndue process considerations requires actual notice to every class member in every case, Phillips \nPetroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 812 (1985), but simply call for \"notice reasonably certain \nto reach most of those interested in objecting is likely to safeguard the interests of all.\" Id; In re \nOCA, 2008 WL 4681369, * 15 (\"due process does not require actual notice to all class \nmembers who may be bound by the litigation\").  Nevertheless, the proposed notice plan has \nbeen developed with the thought of providing notice possible to \"reach\" all Class Members and \nin a form of notice that has been approved on several occasions by this and other Courts. \nCounsel for the Settlement Class will obtain a last known address, date of birth, and \nsocial security number (if possible) for each Class Member. Notice will be provided to the Class \nby direct mailing of Class Notice and a Claim Form to all individuals at their last known or \nreadily ascertainable address.  There will be, in addition, publication notice, as described \npreviously.  Moreover, the Settlement Administrator will also provide a copy of the Class \nNotice and Claim Form to anyone who requests notice through written communication, through \na dedicated internet website, and through a toll-free number to be established. Through these \nextensive efforts, absent Class Members will receive adequate notice of the Settlement.  Finally, \nthis Notice will include all necessary legal requirements and provide a comprehensive \nexplanation of the Settlement in simple, non-legalistic terms. \nVII.  A FINAL FAIRNESS HEARING SHOULD BE SCHEDULED \nThe Court should schedule a final fairness hearing approximately 120 days after the \nNotice Date, to determine that class certification is proper and to approve the settlement.  The \nfairness hearing will provide a forum to explain, describe or challenge the terms and conditions \nof the class certification and settlement, including the fairness, adequacy and reasonableness of \n28 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 113   Filed 08/26/10   Page 38 of 40\nthe settlement. Accordingly, Plaintiffs request that the Court schedule the time, date, and place of \nthe final fairness hearing. \nVIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter an Order: \n(1) preliminarily approving a class settlement with Defendant; (2) directing notice to Class \nmembers regarding settlement of certain claims against Defendant on a final and complete basis; \nand (3) scheduling a final fairness hearing. \nDated:  August 26, 201 0  Respectfully submitted, \nCUNEO GILBERT & LaDUCA, LLP \n507 C Street NE \nWashington, DC  20002 \nTelephone: (202) 789-3960 \nTelecopier: (202) 789-1813 \n-&-\n10 6-A South Columbus Street \nAlexandria, VA 22314 \nTelephone: (202) 789-3960 \nTelecopier: (202) 789-1813 \n/s/ Charles J.

Capitalized  terms  used  in this  Order  have  the  meanings  assigned  to  them  in  the \nSettlement Agreement and this Order. \n2.  The  terms  of the  parties'  Settlement  Agreement  are  hereby conditionally approved, \nsubject to further consideration thereof at the Final Approval Hearing provided for below.  The \nExhibit D - Preliminary Approval Order  Pagel \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 116   Filed 10/13/10   Page 2 of 7\nCourt finds that said settlement is sufficiently withln the range of reasonableness and that notice \nof the proposed settlement should be given as provided in this Order. \n3.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 34, pending final approval by this Court of the Settlement \nAgreement, the Court certifies the following settlement class: \nAll  pre-trial  detainees  confined  to  the  Bexar  County Adult Detention Center \nbetween November 15, 2005 and April 9, 2009 who were subjected to a strip \nsearch before being sent to jail housing after being booked on misdemeanor or \nother minor charges.  Specifically excluded from the class are pre-trial detainees \nwho were subjected to strip search before being sent to jail housing after being \nbooked on a felony charge, or a felony charge and misdemeanor charge. \nThe Court also certifies the following two settlement subclasses: \nSubclass I:  All persons in the Settlement Class, not in Subclass ll. \nSubclass  ll:  All  persons  in  the  Settlement  Class  who  were  admitted  on \nmisdemeanor  charges  of narcotics,  shoplifting  and  weapons  violations.  The \nmisdemeanor offenses which qualify as those constituting charges of narcotics, \nshoplifting and weapons violations are defined by the parties in Exhibit G to this \nSettlement Agreement. \n4.  The Court approves the Class Notice of Settlement attached hereto as Exhibit A and the \nSummary Notice for Publication attached hereto as Exhibit B.

At or before \nthe Final Approval Hearing,  Plaintiff and/or the Claims Administrator shall serve and file a \nsworn statement attesting to compliance with the required notice dissemination. \n7.  The notice to be provided as set forth in the Settlement Agreement as filed with the Court \nis hereby found to be the best practicable means of providing notice under the circumstances and, \nwhen completed, shall constitute due and sufficient notice of the proposed settlement and the \nFinal Approval Hearing to all persons and entities affected by and/or entitled to participate in the \nsettlement, in full compliance with the notice requirements of Fed.

Class Counsel is authorized to retain The Garden City Group as the Claims Administrator \nand I Partners as the Website Administrator in accordance with the terms of the Settlement \nAgreement and this Order. \nRequests for Exclusion from the Settlement Class \n9.  Any member of the Settlement Class that wishes to be excluded ('~opt out\") from the \nSettlement Class must send a written Request for Exclusion to the Claims Administrator, so that \nit is received by the Claims Administrator at the address indicated in the Notice on or before the \nclose of the opt out period.

Jordan  Roger DovaUna \nDeputy Chief, Support Services  Deputy Chief, Jail Administrator \nI.  POLICY:  The Bexar County Sheriffs Office (BCSO) desires to maintain and operate a safe and secure detention facility to \nensure the welfare of inmates and staff.  Strip Searches will not be conducted for harassment or punishment, but rather to \ndetect, reduce and prevent the introduction of weapons or contraband inside the Bexar County Adult Detention Center \n(BCADC) system.  When detention staff have reasonable suspicion, as defmed in Part l1IB below, inmates should undergo a \nthorough strip search for weapons and contraband which may pose a threat to the security and safety of the detention facility. \nn.  PURPOSE: This policy provides guidelines for officers of the BCSO regarding Strip Searches of inmates upon initial intake \nand subsequently in the custody of the BCADC system. \nIII.  DEFINITIONS: \nA.  Strip Search:  In a strip search the inmate is required to remove all clothing.  An officer will then visually inspect the \ninmate's nude body, including the outer areas of orifices and cavities.  All clothing items of the inmate shall also be \nsearched thoroughly in the process.  Strip searches shall be conducted in a suitably private area by an officer of the \nsame sex as the inmate. \nB.  Reasonable  Suspicion:  An  officer's  rational  belief,  based  on  creditable  and  articulate  information  and \ncircumstances, that an offense may have occurred or that a particular person may have committed an offense \n(carrying or concealing contraband). (Bexar County Sheriff's Manual of Policy and Procedures, Chapter 28) \nIV.  CRITERIA FOR STRIP SEARCHES (Booking Intake Process):  Inmates that have been arrested but not yet assigned or \nmoved to housing in the BCADC, may be subject to a strip search ONLY after the authorization from the Section Sergeant \nand when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the inmate possesses weapons, drugs or other contraband.  With regard \nto  inmates being processed in the Intake/Release Section, reasonable  suspicion of possession of contraband must be \ndetennined on a case-by-case basis.  Reasonable suspicion shall not be based on race, ethnic origin, gender, or other \nsubjective factors which indicate prejudice or an irrational predisposition to suspect persons solely as a result of their being a \npart of an otherwise legitimate organization or group. \nA.  Reasonable suspicion can be based on information available to the searching officer including, but not limited to: \n1.  Current charges or previous convictions involving escape, drugs, weapons, or violence. \n2.  History of possession of contraband or prohibited property while in custody. \n3.  Institutional history of escape attempts. \n4.  Contact with the public or exposure to public areas or transport to the hospital after arrest and before \nentering the custody of the Detention Center. \n5.  Refusal or resistance to being frisk (Pat Down) searched (BC No: 900.08-1, Frisk Search). \n6.  Discovery of weapons or drugs during the frisk search. \n7.  Alerted by electronic detection devices. \n8.  Furtive movements, behavior or gestures that raise reasonable suspicion that the inmate is attempting to \nconceal contraband on his/her person. \n9.  Receipt of other reliable information that the arrestee may be in possession of weapons or drugs. \nB.  ELECTRONIC DETECTION DEVICES:  Any electronic control detection device (i.e. Hand-Held Metal Detectors \nand Body Orifice Security Scanners, B.O.S.S.) may be used to detect contraband as deemed necessary by the Intake \n. /Release Section Sergeant/Supervisor. \nC.

For at least the past five years, the Bexar County \nDetention  Center  (the  \"Detention  Center\")  has  had  a policy  and  practice  of strip-\nsearching  all  individuals  regardless  of the  crime  upon  which  they  are  charged.  In \naddition, such policy and practice does not call for any reasonable suspicion analysis \nbefore conducting a strip search. Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, \nderived from the written procedures of the Bexar County Detention Center and was \npromulgated by senior officials of the County of Bexar, acting through the Bexar County \nSheriff s Office. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of Bexar County \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 2 of 15\nand the Bexar County Detention Center to force those charged with minor crimes to \nundergo the indignities of a strip search upon detention is not only clearly illegal, but is \ninsensitive and unnecessary. \nPlaintiff brings  this  action on  behalf of herself and  on  behalf of a class  of \nthousands of others (together, \"Plaintiffs\") who were strip searched after being charged \nwith petty crimes to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their civil rights and \nthose  of the  class members they propose to represent.  Plaintiffs were  charged with \nmisdemeanor and/or violation offenses and were subjected to a strip search, in violation \nof their right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution.  Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for herself and each member of \nthe proposed class, a declaration that the Bexar County Detention Center's policies are \nunconstitutional,  and  an  injunction  precluding  Bexar  County  and  the  Bexar  County \nDetention Center from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody. \nWith this as a background, Plaintiffs complain as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of \nthe United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ \n1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of \nthe policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving \nrise to Plaintiffs' claims occurred in this judicial district. \n2 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 3 of 15\nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Julia Ann Jackson (\"Jackson\" or \"Plaintiff Jackson\") is a 29 year \nold female who resides in Behar County, Texas.  On or about April 14, 2006, Jackson \nwas arrested by the Converse Police Department after they were called to a scene because \nof a noise violation concern and discovered that Jackson had a warrant out for her arrest \nfor driving with an invalid license, a misdemeanor offense.  After being held by the \nConverse Police Department for a period of several hours, Jackson was transported to and \nheld by the Bexar County Detention Center. \n4.  Defendant  County  of Bexar  (the  \"County\")  is  a  county  government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of Texas.  At all times relevant hereto, \nthe County, acting through the Bexar County Sheriff s Office and the Bexar County \nDetention Center, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation \nand  conduct  of all  matters  pertaining  to  the  center  and  was  responsible  for  the \nappointment, training, supervision and conduct of all personnel, including those working \nin the  Bexar County  Detention Center (the \"Detention Center\").  In addition,  at all \nrelevant times, the County, acting through the Bexar County  Sheriffs Office and the \nDetention Center, was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Detention Center and for \nensuring that detention personnel obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States \nand of the State of Texas. \n3 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 4 of 15\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n5.  Plaintiff Jackson brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) \nand 23(b )(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of herself and a class of \nsimilarly situated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and \nwere strip searched upon their entry into the Bexar County Detention Center. \n6.  The class that Plaintiff Jackson seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nBexar  County  Detention  Center  after  being  charged  with \nmisdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic \ninfractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and were or \nwill  be  strip  searched  upon  their  entry  into  the  Bexar  County \nDetention  Center pursuant to  the  policy,  custom and  practice  of \nBexar County.  The class period commences on November 15,2005, \nand extends to the date on which Bexar County and the Detention \nCenter  are  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise  ceases,  enforcing  its \nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of conducting  strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from \nthe class are Defendant and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n7.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class \naction under Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and \nadequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n8.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder \nimpracticable.  Upon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for \nmisdemeanors and violations who are placed into the custody of the Detention Center \nevery month .-all of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and \nbelief, the size of the proposed class totals at least 10,000 individuals, some of whom \nhave had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions. \n9.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is \nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class \n4 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 5 of 15\nmembers are likely dispersed over a large geographical area, with some members \npresently residing outside of Bexar County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon \ninformation and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may not \nspeak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n10.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, in \nthat they all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Detention \nOfficers conducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the \nclass were charged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the \nDetention Center, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the established law \nin this judicial circuit. \n11.  Plaintiff Jackson's claims are typical of the claims ofthe members of the \nclass.  Plaintiff Jackson and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of \nDefendant's course of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the \nharms suffered by the class members. \n12.  The representative Plaintiff, Julia Ann Jackson, has the requisite personal \ninterest in the outcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe  class.  Plaintiff Jackson has no  interests that are  adverse  to  the  interests of the \nmembers of the class. \n13.  Plaintiff Jackson has retained counsel who have substantial experience and \nsuccess in the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiff, \nJulia Ann Jackson, is being represented by Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, \nLLP; Sam H. Lock of The Law Offices of Sam H. Lock; James Harrington of the Texas \nCivil Rights Project; Bob Keach of the Law Offices of Elmer Keach; Gary Mason and \n5 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 6 of 15\nAlexander Barnett of the Mason Law Firm; and Kerissa Chelkowski of the Law Offices \nof Kerissa Chelkowski. \n14.  In  short,  Plaintiff Jackson's  counsel  has  the  resources,  expertise  and \nexperience to  successfully prosecute this  action  against  Bexar County.  Counsel  for \nPlaintiff Jackson know of no conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel \nand members of the class. \n15.  This  action,  in part,  seeks declaratory and  injunctive relief.  As  such, \nPlaintiffs seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Detention Center. \nIn short, the County of Bexar and Detention Center Officers acted on grounds generally \napplicable to all class members. \n16.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b) (2), and in the alternative, \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b )(3). \n17.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, \nand predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the class. \nThese common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and \npredominate question of whether the Defendant's written andlor de facto policy of strip \nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to \nthe Detention Center is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution, and whether such a written andlor de facto  policy existed \nduring the class period. \n18.  A class  action  is  superior to  other available  methods for  the  fair  and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members \n6 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 7 of 15\nof the class is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that \nthey are dispersed over a large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden \nof individual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of \nthe class to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the  delay  and expense to  all parties and the  court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the class. \n19.  Upon  information  and  belief,  there  are  no  other  actions  pending  to \naddress the Defendant's flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, \neven though the Defendant has maintained the illegal strip search regimen for at least the \npast two (2) years. \n20.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs \nalso seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n21.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials, such as the Detention Center Corrections Officers, from performing strip \nsearches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes \nunless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a \nweapon or contraband. \n7 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 8 of 15\n22.  Upon information and belief, the County of Bexar and the Bexar County \nDetention Center have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of \nstrip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Detention Center and are \nplaced into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the \npresence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon \nor contraband. \n23.  Upon information and belief, Bexar County and the Bexar County \nDetention Center have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of \nconducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the vaginal and rectal \ncavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Detention Center, regardless of \nthe individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime.  These strip searches \noccur in front of other pretrial detainees, not in a private setting.  For purposes of this \nComplaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as (\"strip \nsearches\") . \n24.  The Bexar County Sheriffs Office Search Policy, a true and correct copy \nof which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, specifically provides that routine strip searches \nwill be conducted \"[u]pon the admissions process, during the issuance of the inmate \nuniform.\"  Ex. A at 2. \n25.  The County of Bexar knows that it may not institute, enforce or permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion. \n26.  The  Defendant's  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \n8 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 9 of 15\npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n27.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n28.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Bexar  County  and  the  Bexar  County \nDetention Center have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a \nwritten and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all individuals placed \ninto  the  custody  of the  Detention  Center  and  placed  into jail clothing  without  any \nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or \nde facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature \nof the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a \nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of \nroutine strip searches. \n29.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Bexar County Detention Center.  These searches were conducted without inquiry \ninto  or  establishment  of reasonable  suspicion,  and  in  fact  were  not  supported  by \nreasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among \nother innocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n30.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches \n-each member of the class, including the named Plaintiffs -- have suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n9 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 10 of 15\nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n31.  Plaintiff Julia Ann Jackson was  arrested on misdemeanor charges and \nadmitted to the Bexar County Detention Center.  The charges for which Jackson was \narrested did not, in and of themselves, provide Detention Center Corrections Officers \nwith  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Jackson  was  harboring  any  weapons  or \ncontraband. \n32.  Jackson was strip searched after her admission to the Detention Center. \nAfter being held in a holding cell for almost two days, she, along with approximately 25 \nother female pre-trial detainees, was taken into a changing room to remove her street \nclothes and change into a Detention Center uniform.  Immediately prior to providing \nJackson  with  the  Detention  Center  uniform,  a female  Corrections  Officer  required \nJackson to submit to a strip search whereby the Officer and another detainee were able to \nview Jackson while she was in a state of complete undress. \n33.  Jackson was later released from the Detention Center after she was able to \npay bail. \n34.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to Defendant's policy, practice and custom, Jackson has suffered and continues \nto suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n--Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law-\n10 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 11 of 15\n35.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 34. \n36.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable  searches by law enforcement officers,  and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n37.  The actions of Defendant detailed above violated Plaintiffs' rights under \nthe  United  States  Constitution.  Simply  put,  it  was  not  objectively  reasonable  for \nDetention Center Officers to strip search Plaintiff Jackson and Class members based on \ntheir arrests for misdemeanor/violation charges. \n38.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of Bexar County and the  Bexar County  Detention Center.  As  such,  Bexar \nCounty is directly liable for the damages of Plaintiff and members of the Class. \n39.  This conduct on the part of Defendant represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that the actions of the Detention Center Officers were undertaken under \ncolor of state law. \n40.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described \nabove, Plaintiffs have been irreparably injured. \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n--Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n41.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 40. \n11 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 12 of 15\n42.  The policy, custom and practice of the Bexar County Detention Center and \nthe County of Bexar is clearly unconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Detention Center \nwithout  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either \ncontraband or weapons. \n43.  Plaintiffs  and  members  of the  class  request  that  this  Court  issue  a \ndeclaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of Bexar County and the \nBexar County Detention Center to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n--Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n44.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 43. \n45.  The policy, custom and practice of the Bexar County Detention Center and \nBexar  County  is  clearly  unconstitutional,  in  that  these  entities  and  individuals  are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Detention Center \nwithout  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either \ncontraband or weapons. \n46.  Upon  infonnation  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in  place  at  the \nDetention Center, with new and/or prospective members of the class being subjected to \nthe harms that have already been inflicted upon the Plaintiffs. \n47.  The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable hann to the new and/or prospective members of the class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n12 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 13 of 15\n48.  Plaintiffs demand that the Bexar County, the Detention Center, and Bexar \nCounty Corrections Officers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed \ninto the custody of the Detention Center absent any particularized suspicion that the \nindividuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary \nand permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Julia Ann Jackson, on behalf of herself and on behalf of \na class of others similarly situated, requests that this Honorable Court grant them the \nfollowing relief: \n1.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23. \n2.  A  judgment  against  Defendant  awarding  compensatory  damages  to \nPlaintiff and  each member of the  proposed  class  in  an  amount to  be \ndetermined by a Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class \nwide basis. \n3.  A declaratory judgment against Defendant declaring the  Bexar County \nDetention Center's policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity \nsearching all detainees entering the Detention Center, regardless of the \ncrime  charged  or  suspicion  of contraband,  to  be  unconstitutional  and \nimproper. \n4.  A preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendant  and  the \nBexar County Detention Center from continuing to strip and visual cavity \nsearch individuals charged with misdemeanors  or minor crimes absent \n13 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 14 of 15\nparticularized.  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  arrestee  subjected  to  the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \n5.  A monetary award for attorney's fees and the costs of this action, pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nDated:  November 15,2007 \nS  .  0  squire \nLaw  es of Sam H.

For at least the past five years, the Bexar County \nDetention  Center  (the  \"Detention  Center\")  has  had  a  policy  and  practice  of strip-\nsearching  all  individuals  regardless  of the  crime  upon  which they  are  charged.  In \naddition, such policy and practice does not call for any reasonable suspicion analysis \nbefore conducting a strip search. Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, \nderived from the  written procedures of the  Bexar County Detention Center and was \npromulgated by senior officials of the County of Bexar, acting through the Bexar County \nSheriff s Office. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of Bexar County \nand the Bexar County Detention Center to force those charged with minor crimes to \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 2 of 16\nundergo the indignities of a strip search upon detention is not only clearly illegal, but is \ninsensitive and unnecessary. \nPlaintiffs Julia Ann Jackson, Erica Bernal, and Martin Martinez brings this action \non behalf of themselves  and  on behalf of a  class  of thousands  of others  (together, \n\"Plaintiffs\") who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes to vindicate \nthe clear and unnecessary violation of their civil rights and those of the class members \nthey propose to represent.  Plaintiffs were charged with misdemeanor and/or violation \noffenses  and  were  subjected  to  a  strip  search,  in  violation  of their  right  against \nunreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \nPlaintiffs seek monetary damages for themselves and each member of the proposed class, \na declaration that the Bexar County Detention Center's policies are unconstitutional, and \nan injunction precluding Bexar County and the Bexar County Detention Center from \ncontinuing  to  violate the rights  of those  placed into their custody.  With this  as  a \nbackground, Plaintiffs complain as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.c. §§  1331, 1341 &  1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of \nthe United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ \n1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of \nthe policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving \nrise to Plaintiffs' claims occurred in this judicial district. \n2 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 3 of 16\nPARTIES \n3.

On or about November 27, 2005, Martinez was \narrested on charges of DWI-2, a misdemeanor offense.  He was admitted to the Bexar \nCounty Detention Center on the same date. \n6.  Defendant  County  of Bexar  (the  \"County\")  is  a  county  government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of Texas.  At all times relevant hereto, \nthe County,  acting through the Bexar County Sheriffs Office and the Bexar County \nDetention Center, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation \nand  conduct  of all  matters  pertaining  to  the  center  and  was  responsible  for  the \nappointment, training, supervision and conduct of all personnel, including those working \nin the Bexar County Detention Center (the \"Detention Center\").  In addition,  at  all \n3 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 4 of 16\nrelevant times, the County, acting through the Bexar County  Sheriff s Office and the \nDetention Center, was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Detention Center and for \nensuring that detention personnel obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States \nand of the State of Texas. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n7.  Plaintiffs  brings  this  action  pursuant  to  Rules  23(b)(I),  23(b)(2)  and \n23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of \nsimilarly situated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and \nwere strip searched upon their entry into the Bexar County Detention Center. \n8.  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nBexar  County  Detention  Center  after  being  charged  with \nmisdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic \ninfractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and were or \nwill  be  strip  searched  upon  their  entry  into  the  Bexar  County \nDetention Center pursuant to  the  policy,  custom and practice of \nBexar County.  The class period commences on November 15,2005, \nand extends to the date on which Bexar County and the Detention \nCenter  are  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise  ceases,  enforcing  its \nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of conducting  strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from \nthe class are Defendant and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n9.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class \naction under Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and \nadequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n10.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder \nimpracticable.  Upon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for \nmisdemeanors and violations who are placed into the custody of the Detention Center \nevery month -- all of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and \n4 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 5 of 16\nbelief, the size of the proposed class totals at least 10,000 individuals, some of whom \nhave had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions. \n11.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is \nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class \nmembers are likely dispersed over a large geographical area, with some members \npresently residing outside of Bexar County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon \ninformation and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may not \nspeak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n12.  Common questions oflaw and fact exist as to all members ofthe class, in \nthat they all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Detention \nOfficers conducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the \nclass were charged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the \nDetention Center, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the established law \nin this judicial circuit. \n13.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of the members of the class. \nPlaintiffs and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendant's \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n14.  The representative  Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the class. \n15.  Plaintiffs  have  retained  counsel  who  have  substantial  experience  and \nsuccess in the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiffs \nare being represented by Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert &  LaDuca, LLP;  Sam H. \n5 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 6 of 16\nLock of The Law Offices of Sam H. Lock; James Harrington of the Texas Civil Rights \nProject; Bob Keach of the Law Offices of Elmer Keach; Gary Mason and Alexander \nBarnett of the Mason Law Firm; and Kerrisa Chelkowski of the Law Offices of Kerrisa \nChelkowski. \n16.  In short, Plaintiffs' counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against Bexar County.  Counsel for Plaintiffs know of \nno conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n17.  This  action,  in part,  seeks  declaratory and injunctive relief.  As  such, \nPlaintiffs seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Detention Center. \nIn short, the County of Bexar and Detention Center Officers acted on grounds generally \napplicable to all class members. \n18.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b) (2), and in the alternative, \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b) (3). \n19.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, \nand predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the class. \nThese common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and \npredominate question of whether the Defendant's written and/or de facto policy of strip \nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to \nthe Detention Center is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de facto  policy existed \nduring the class period. \n6 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 7 of 16\n20.  A  class  action is  superior to  other available  methods  for the  fair  and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members \nof the class is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that \nthey are dispersed over a large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden \nof individual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of \nthe class to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also  magnify the  delay  and  expense to  all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the class. \n21.  Upon  information  and  belief,  there  are  no  other  actions  pending  to \naddress the Defendant's flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, \neven though the Defendant has maintained the illegal strip search regimen for at least the \npast two (2) years. \n22.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs \nalso seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n23.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials, such as the Detention Center Corrections Officers, from performing strip \nsearches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes \nunless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a \nweapon or contraband. \n7 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 8 of 16\n24.  Upon information and belief, the County of Bexar and the Bexar County \nDetention Center have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of \nstrip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Detention Center and are \nplaced into jail clothing, regardless ofthe nature of their charged crime and without the \npresence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon \nor contraband. \n25.  Upon information and belief, Bexar County and the Bexar County \nDetention Center have instituted a written and/or defacto policy, custom or practice of \nconducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the vaginal and rectal \ncavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Detention Center, regardless of \nthe individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime.  These strip searches \noccur in front of other pretrial detainees, not in a private setting.  For purposes of this \nComplaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as (\"strip \nsearches\"). \n26.  The  strip  searches  were  conducted  intentionally,  knowingly,  and/or \nrecklessly, causing Plaintiffs and Class members to have a reasonable apprehension of \nimminent harmful or offensive contact.  Defendant knew,  or should have reasonably \nbelieved, that Plaintiffs and Class members would regard the contact as offensive or \nprovocative. \n27.  The Bexar County Sheriff's Office Search Policy, a true and correct copy \nof which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, specifically provides that routine strip searches \nwill be· conducted \"[u ] pon the admissions process, during the issuance of the inmate \nuniform.\" Ex. A at 2. \n8 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 9 of 16\n28.  The County of Bexar knows that it may not institute, enforce or permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion. \n29.  The  Defendant's  written  and/or  de facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n30.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n31.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Bexar  County  and  the  Bexar  County \nDetention Center have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a \nwritten and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all individuals placed \ninto  the  custody  of the  Detention  Center and  placed into jail  clothing  without any \nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or \nde facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature \nof the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a \nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of \nroutine strip searches. \n32.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the class, \nincluding the named Plaintiffs, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Bexar County Detention Center.  These searches were conducted without inquiry \ninto  or  establishment  of reasonable  suspicion,  and  in  fact  were  not  supported  by \n9 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 10 of 16\nreasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among \nother innocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n33.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to this written and! or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches -\n- each member of the class, including the named Plaintiffs -- have suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \n34.  Plaintiff Julia Ann Jackson was  arrested on misdemeanor charges  and \nadmitted to the Bexar County Detention Center.  The charges for which Jackson was \narrested did not, in and of themselves, provide Detention Center Corrections Officers \nwith  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Jackson  was  harboring  any  weapons  or \ncontraband. \n35.  Jackson was strip searched after her admission to the Detention Center. \nAfter being held in a holding cell for almost two days, she, along with approximately 25 \nother female pre-trial detainees, was taken into a changing room to remove her street \nclothes and change into a Detention Center uniform.  Immediately prior to providing \nJackson  with  the  Detention  Center  uniform,  a  female  Corrections  Officer  required \nJackson to submit to a strip search whereby the Officer and another detainee were able to \nview Jackson while she was in a state of complete undress. \n36.  Jackson was later released from the Detention Center after she was able to \npay bail. \n37.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to Defendant's policy, practice and custom, Jackson has suffered and continues \nto suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n10 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 11 of 16\n38.  Plaintiff Erica Bernal was arrested on misdemeanor charges and admitted \nto the Bexar County Detention Center.  The charges for which Bernal was arrested did \nnot, in and of themselves, provide Detention Center Corrections Officers with reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that Bernal was harboring any weapons or contraband. \n39.  Like  Jackson,  Bernal  was  strip  searched  after  her  admission  to  the \nDetention Center, so that a Corrections Officer and other detainees were able to observe \nher while she was in a state of complete undress. \n40.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to Defendant's policy, practice and custom, Bernal has suffered and continues to \nsuffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n41.  Plaintiff Martin  Martinez  was  arrested  on  misdemeanor  charges  and \nadmitted to the Bexar County Detention Center.  The charges for which Martinez was \narrested did not, in and of themselves, provide Detention Center Corrections Officers \nwith  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Martinez  was  harboring  any  weapons  or \ncontraband. \n42.  Martinez was strip searched after his admission to the Detention Center \nwhereby a Corrections Officer and other detainees were able to view Martinez while he \nwas in a state of complete undress. \n43.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to Defendant's policy, practice and custom, Martinez has suffered and continues \nto suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n11 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 12 of 16\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n--Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law -\n44.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 43. \n45.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable  searches by law enforcement officers,  and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \n\" \nweapons. \n46.  The actions of Defendant detailed above violated Plaintiffs' rights under \nthe  United  States  Constitution.  Simply  put,  it  was  not  objectively  reasonable  for \nDetention Center Officers to strip search Plaintiffs and Class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/violation charges. \n47.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of Bexar County and the  Bexar County Detention Center.  As  such,  Bexar \nCounty is directly liable for the damages of Plaintiffs and members of the Class. \n48.  This conduct on the part of Defendant represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that the actions of the Detention Center Officers were undertaken under \ncolor of state law. \n49.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described \nabove, Plaintiffs have been irreparably injured. \n12 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 13 of 16\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n--Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n50.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 49. \n51.  The policy, custom and practice of the Bexar County Detention Center and \nthe County of Bexar is clearly unconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Detention Center \nwithout  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either \ncontraband or weapons. \n52.  Plaintiffs  and  members  of the  class  request  that  this  Court  issue  a \ndeclaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of Bexar County and the \nBexar County Detention Center to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n53.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 52. \n54.  The policy, custom and practice of the Bexar County Detention Center and \nBexar  County  is  clearly  unconstitutional,  in  that  these  entities  and  individuals  are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Detention Center \nwithout  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either \ncontraband or weapons. \n13 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 14 of 16\n55.  Upon  information  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in place  at  the \nDetention Center, with new and/or prospective members of the class being subjected to \nthe harms that have already been inflicted upon the Plaintiffs. \n56.  The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n57.  Plaintiffs demand that the Bexar County, the Detention Center, and Bexar \nCounty Corrections Officers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed \ninto the custody of the Detention Center absent any particularized suspicion that the \nindividuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary \nand permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Julia Ann Jackson, Erica Bernal, and Martin Martinez, \non behalf of themselves and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated, request that \nthis Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \n1.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23. \n2.  A  judgment  against  Defendant  awarding  compensatory  damages  to \nPlaintiffs and each member of the proposed class in an amount to  be \ndetermined by a Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class \nwide basis. \n3.  A declaratory judgment against Defendant declaring the Bexar County \nDetention Center's policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity \nsearching all detainees entering the Detention Center, regardless of the \n14 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB   Document 92   Filed 11/16/09   Page 15 of 16\ncnme  charged  or  suspicion  of contraband,  to  be  unconstitutional  and \nImproper. \n4.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendant  and  the \nBexar County Detention Center from continuing to strip and visual cavity \nsearch individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes absent \nparticularized,  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  arrestee  subjected  to  the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \n5.

For at least the past five years, the Bexar County \nDetention  Center  (the  \"Detention  Center\")  has  had  a policy  and  practice  of strip-\nsearching  all  individuals  regardless  of the  crime  upon  which  they  are  charged.  In \naddition, such policy and practice does not call for any reasonable suspicion analysis \nbefore conducting a strip search. Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, \nderived from the written procedures of the Bexar County Detention Center and was \npromulgated by senior officials of the County of Bexar, acting through the Bexar County \nSheriff s Office. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of Bexar County \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 2 of 15\nand the Bexar County Detention Center to force those charged with minor crimes to \nundergo the indignities of a strip search upon detention is not only clearly illegal, but is \ninsensitive and unnecessary. \nPlaintiff brings  this  action on  behalf of herself and  on  behalf of a class  of \nthousands of others (together, \"Plaintiffs\") who were strip searched after being charged \nwith petty crimes to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their civil rights and \nthose  of the  class members they propose to represent.  Plaintiffs were  charged with \nmisdemeanor and/or violation offenses and were subjected to a strip search, in violation \nof their right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution.  Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for herself and each member of \nthe proposed class, a declaration that the Bexar County Detention Center's policies are \nunconstitutional,  and  an  injunction  precluding  Bexar  County  and  the  Bexar  County \nDetention Center from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody. \nWith this as a background, Plaintiffs complain as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of \nthe United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ \n1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of \nthe policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving \nrise to Plaintiffs' claims occurred in this judicial district. \n2 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 3 of 15\nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Julia Ann Jackson (\"Jackson\" or \"Plaintiff Jackson\") is a 29 year \nold female who resides in Behar County, Texas.  On or about April 14, 2006, Jackson \nwas arrested by the Converse Police Department after they were called to a scene because \nof a noise violation concern and discovered that Jackson had a warrant out for her arrest \nfor driving with an invalid license, a misdemeanor offense.  After being held by the \nConverse Police Department for a period of several hours, Jackson was transported to and \nheld by the Bexar County Detention Center. \n4.  Defendant  County  of Bexar  (the  \"County\")  is  a  county  government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of Texas.  At all times relevant hereto, \nthe County, acting through the Bexar County Sheriff s Office and the Bexar County \nDetention Center, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation \nand  conduct  of all  matters  pertaining  to  the  center  and  was  responsible  for  the \nappointment, training, supervision and conduct of all personnel, including those working \nin the  Bexar County  Detention Center (the \"Detention Center\").  In addition,  at all \nrelevant times, the County, acting through the Bexar County  Sheriffs Office and the \nDetention Center, was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Detention Center and for \nensuring that detention personnel obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States \nand of the State of Texas. \n3 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 4 of 15\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n5.  Plaintiff Jackson brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) \nand 23(b )(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of herself and a class of \nsimilarly situated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and \nwere strip searched upon their entry into the Bexar County Detention Center. \n6.  The class that Plaintiff Jackson seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nBexar  County  Detention  Center  after  being  charged  with \nmisdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or parole, traffic \ninfractions, civil commitments or other minor crimes and were or \nwill  be  strip  searched  upon  their  entry  into  the  Bexar  County \nDetention  Center pursuant to  the  policy,  custom and  practice  of \nBexar County.  The class period commences on November 15,2005, \nand extends to the date on which Bexar County and the Detention \nCenter  are  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise  ceases,  enforcing  its \nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of conducting  strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from \nthe class are Defendant and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n7.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class \naction under Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and \nadequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n8.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder \nimpracticable.  Upon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for \nmisdemeanors and violations who are placed into the custody of the Detention Center \nevery month .-all of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and \nbelief, the size of the proposed class totals at least 10,000 individuals, some of whom \nhave had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions. \n9.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is \nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class \n4 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 5 of 15\nmembers are likely dispersed over a large geographical area, with some members \npresently residing outside of Bexar County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon \ninformation and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may not \nspeak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n10.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, in \nthat they all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Detention \nOfficers conducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the \nclass were charged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the \nDetention Center, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the established law \nin this judicial circuit. \n11.  Plaintiff Jackson's claims are typical of the claims ofthe members of the \nclass.  Plaintiff Jackson and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of \nDefendant's course of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the \nharms suffered by the class members. \n12.  The representative Plaintiff, Julia Ann Jackson, has the requisite personal \ninterest in the outcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe  class.  Plaintiff Jackson has no  interests that are  adverse  to  the  interests of the \nmembers of the class. \n13.  Plaintiff Jackson has retained counsel who have substantial experience and \nsuccess in the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiff, \nJulia Ann Jackson, is being represented by Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, \nLLP; Sam H. Lock of The Law Offices of Sam H. Lock; James Harrington of the Texas \nCivil Rights Project; Bob Keach of the Law Offices of Elmer Keach; Gary Mason and \n5 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 6 of 15\nAlexander Barnett of the Mason Law Firm; and Kerissa Chelkowski of the Law Offices \nof Kerissa Chelkowski. \n14.  In  short,  Plaintiff Jackson's  counsel  has  the  resources,  expertise  and \nexperience to  successfully prosecute this  action  against  Bexar County.  Counsel  for \nPlaintiff Jackson know of no conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel \nand members of the class. \n15.  This  action,  in part,  seeks declaratory and  injunctive relief.  As  such, \nPlaintiffs seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Detention Center. \nIn short, the County of Bexar and Detention Center Officers acted on grounds generally \napplicable to all class members. \n16.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b) (2), and in the alternative, \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b )(3). \n17.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, \nand predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the class. \nThese common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and \npredominate question of whether the Defendant's written andlor de facto policy of strip \nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to \nthe Detention Center is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution, and whether such a written andlor de facto  policy existed \nduring the class period. \n18.  A class  action  is  superior to  other available  methods for  the  fair  and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members \n6 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 7 of 15\nof the class is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that \nthey are dispersed over a large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden \nof individual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of \nthe class to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the  delay  and expense to  all parties and the  court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the class. \n19.  Upon  information  and  belief,  there  are  no  other  actions  pending  to \naddress the Defendant's flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, \neven though the Defendant has maintained the illegal strip search regimen for at least the \npast two (2) years. \n20.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs \nalso seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n21.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials, such as the Detention Center Corrections Officers, from performing strip \nsearches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes \nunless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a \nweapon or contraband. \n7 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 8 of 15\n22.  Upon information and belief, the County of Bexar and the Bexar County \nDetention Center have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of \nstrip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Detention Center and are \nplaced into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the \npresence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon \nor contraband. \n23.  Upon information and belief, Bexar County and the Bexar County \nDetention Center have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of \nconducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the vaginal and rectal \ncavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Detention Center, regardless of \nthe individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime.  These strip searches \noccur in front of other pretrial detainees, not in a private setting.  For purposes of this \nComplaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as (\"strip \nsearches\") . \n24.  The Bexar County Sheriffs Office Search Policy, a true and correct copy \nof which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, specifically provides that routine strip searches \nwill be conducted \"[u]pon the admissions process, during the issuance of the inmate \nuniform.\"  Ex. A at 2. \n25.  The County of Bexar knows that it may not institute, enforce or permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion. \n26.  The  Defendant's  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \n8 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 9 of 15\npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n27.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n28.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Bexar  County  and  the  Bexar  County \nDetention Center have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a \nwritten and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all individuals placed \ninto  the  custody  of the  Detention  Center  and  placed  into jail clothing  without  any \nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or \nde facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature \nof the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a \nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of \nroutine strip searches. \n29.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Bexar County Detention Center.  These searches were conducted without inquiry \ninto  or  establishment  of reasonable  suspicion,  and  in  fact  were  not  supported  by \nreasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among \nother innocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n30.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches \n-each member of the class, including the named Plaintiffs -- have suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n9 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 10 of 15\nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n31.  Plaintiff Julia Ann Jackson was  arrested on misdemeanor charges and \nadmitted to the Bexar County Detention Center.  The charges for which Jackson was \narrested did not, in and of themselves, provide Detention Center Corrections Officers \nwith  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Jackson  was  harboring  any  weapons  or \ncontraband. \n32.  Jackson was strip searched after her admission to the Detention Center. \nAfter being held in a holding cell for almost two days, she, along with approximately 25 \nother female pre-trial detainees, was taken into a changing room to remove her street \nclothes and change into a Detention Center uniform.  Immediately prior to providing \nJackson  with  the  Detention  Center  uniform,  a female  Corrections  Officer  required \nJackson to submit to a strip search whereby the Officer and another detainee were able to \nview Jackson while she was in a state of complete undress. \n33.  Jackson was later released from the Detention Center after she was able to \npay bail. \n34.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to Defendant's policy, practice and custom, Jackson has suffered and continues \nto suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n--Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law-\n10 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 11 of 15\n35.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 34. \n36.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable  searches by law enforcement officers,  and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n37.  The actions of Defendant detailed above violated Plaintiffs' rights under \nthe  United  States  Constitution.  Simply  put,  it  was  not  objectively  reasonable  for \nDetention Center Officers to strip search Plaintiff Jackson and Class members based on \ntheir arrests for misdemeanor/violation charges. \n38.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of Bexar County and the  Bexar County  Detention Center.  As  such,  Bexar \nCounty is directly liable for the damages of Plaintiff and members of the Class. \n39.  This conduct on the part of Defendant represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that the actions of the Detention Center Officers were undertaken under \ncolor of state law. \n40.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described \nabove, Plaintiffs have been irreparably injured. \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n--Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n41.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 40. \n11 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 12 of 15\n42.  The policy, custom and practice of the Bexar County Detention Center and \nthe County of Bexar is clearly unconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Detention Center \nwithout  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either \ncontraband or weapons. \n43.  Plaintiffs  and  members  of the  class  request  that  this  Court  issue  a \ndeclaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of Bexar County and the \nBexar County Detention Center to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n--Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n44.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 43. \n45.  The policy, custom and practice of the Bexar County Detention Center and \nBexar  County  is  clearly  unconstitutional,  in  that  these  entities  and  individuals  are \ndirecting/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Detention Center \nwithout  any  particularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either \ncontraband or weapons. \n46.  Upon  infonnation  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in  place  at  the \nDetention Center, with new and/or prospective members of the class being subjected to \nthe harms that have already been inflicted upon the Plaintiffs. \n47.  The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable hann to the new and/or prospective members of the class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n12 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 13 of 15\n48.  Plaintiffs demand that the Bexar County, the Detention Center, and Bexar \nCounty Corrections Officers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed \ninto the custody of the Detention Center absent any particularized suspicion that the \nindividuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary \nand permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Julia Ann Jackson, on behalf of herself and on behalf of \na class of others similarly situated, requests that this Honorable Court grant them the \nfollowing relief: \n1.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23. \n2.  A  judgment  against  Defendant  awarding  compensatory  damages  to \nPlaintiff and  each member of the  proposed  class  in  an  amount to  be \ndetermined by a Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class \nwide basis. \n3.  A declaratory judgment against Defendant declaring the  Bexar County \nDetention Center's policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity \nsearching all detainees entering the Detention Center, regardless of the \ncrime  charged  or  suspicion  of contraband,  to  be  unconstitutional  and \nimproper. \n4.  A preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendant  and  the \nBexar County Detention Center from continuing to strip and visual cavity \nsearch individuals charged with misdemeanors  or minor crimes absent \n13 \n\nCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB     Document 1      Filed 11/15/2007     Page 14 of 15\nparticularized.  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  arrestee  subjected  to  the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \n5.  A monetary award for attorney's fees and the costs of this action, pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nDated:  November 15,2007 \nS  .  0  squire \nLaw  es of Sam H.
