The plaintiffs challenged the treatment of juveniles in the custody of the Texas Youth Commission (TYC). The plaintiffs alleged that the TYC routinely and daily violated the constitutional rights of children incarcerated in TYC facilities and \"relegated their youthful lives to a living hell.\" The plaintiffs asserted claims for: denial of due process; lack of access to courts; forced self incrimination; failure to protect; excessive force; sexual assault; failure to provide medical treatment; retaliation for exercising right to free speech; violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12111 et seq. and Section 504 (Rehabilitation Act), 29 U.S.C. &sect; 701. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. The complaint was amended on May 5, 2007, to name additional plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On November 19, 2007, A.B., one of the individually named plaintiffs, moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the TYC from requiring him to confess to his alleged crime as a condition of completion of its sex offender treatment program and release from custody. A.B., who maintained his innocence of an attempted rape charge, asserted that the program violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, as the appeal in his criminal case was still pending.</p>\r\n<p>On April 11, 2008, the parties reached a settlement agreement through mediation. According to the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304142740/http://www.texascivilrightsproject.org/programs-and-services/civil-rights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Texas Civil Rights Project</a>, TYC agreed to pay $625,000 and to make extensive changes to facilities and policies outlined in a nine page document.</p>",

TYC denies A.B. parole and \nadmission to treatment programs because he is asserting his constitutional protections against \n1 In Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, A.B. is incorrectly identified as “Eric B.”  Pursuant to this Court’s standing \nPrivacy  Policy  and  Public  Access  to  Electonic  Files,  A.B.  is  appropriately  identified  by  his  initials,  not  a \npseudonym.   \n3\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 4 of 15\nself-incrimination.  Ms. Brockway requests TYC be prohibited from conditioning A.B.’s parole \non surrendering his Fifth Amendment protections, and requests A.B. be allowed to complete \ntreatment in a less restrictive setting. \n  In support, Ms. Brockway will show: \nFACTS\n  A.B.  is  a  sixteen-year-old  child  currently  held  in  the  custody  of  the  Texas  Youth \nCommission (“TYC”) at the McClennan County State Juvenile Correctional Facility II, in Mart, \nTX (“Mart”).  Defendant Ed Owens is TYC’s Conservator.2  A.B. arrived in TYC custody on \nNovember  6,  2006.    Exhibit  1,  Monthly  Individual  Case  Plan,  July  17,  2007.    A.B.  was \nadjudicated delinquent in the juvenile court in Collin County, TX, on November 2, 2006, for the \noffense of attempted sexual assault.  Exhibit 2, Order of Disposition with TYC Commitment.  \nA.B. has appealed his adjudication to the Texas Fifth Court of Appeals, challenging, inter alia,\nthe sufficiency of the evidence presented and the failure of the trial court to allow the jury to \nconsider the lesser included offense of assault.  See Brief for Appellant, A.E.B. v. State, No. 05-\n06-1536-CV (Tex. App.—Dallas filed March 14, 2007).  A.B. denies he committed the charged \noffense, and refuses to answer questions about it on advice of counsel.   \n  Pending the resolution of his appeal, A.B. was sentenced to TYC custody for the purpose \nof rehabilitation.  See Exhibit 2 (“the child is in need of rehabilitation”).  TYC’s statutory \npurpose  is  “to  provide  a  program  of  constructive  training  aimed  at  rehabilitation  and \nreestablishment in society of children adjudged delinquent.”  TEX. HUM. RES. CODE ANN. § \n61.002  (Vernon  2001).    To  fulfill  this  statutory  mandate,  TYC  has  created  the \n“Resocialization©” program.  To be released from a secure TYC facility to a less restrictive \nsetting (such as a halfway house or their parents’ custody), a child has to complete their “phases” \n2 When Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint, Owens was TYC’s Acting Executive Director.  Owens has since \nbeen made the conservator, and Dimitria Pope has been appointed Acting Executive Director.   \n4\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 5 of 15\nin the “Resocialization©” program and complete their “Minimum Length of Stay” in TYC’s \nsecure facilities custody.3  The secure facilities are prison-like.  There are five phases (0-4) to the \nprogram, and each phase has three components (Academic, Behavior, and Correctional, or A, B, \nC).  A child can complete one of their phases, and not advance in the others.  After A.B. \ncompletes all three components, TYC’s Sex Offender Treatment Program, and serves one year in \nTYC custody, he will be paroled and released from TYC’s custody.  37 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § \n85.59(d)(2) (2007).\n  To complete the “Correctional Therapy,” or “C” phase, a child must identify the “errors \nin [their] thinking.”  “C-1” requires memorizing “nine thinking errors.”  “C-2” requires a child to \nwrite and memorize their “life story.”  “C-3” requires a child to talk about their “offense.”  “C-4” \nrequires developing a “success plan,” which outlines what the child will do when they leave \nTYC custody. See 37 TEX.ADMIN.CODE § 87.3(d)(3).\n  Because  he  was  adjudicated  for  committing  a  sex  offense,  A.B.  is  also  required  to \ncomplete TYC’s Sex Offender Treatment Program before he can be released from a secure \nfacility  to  a  less  restrictive  setting.    37  TEX. ADMIN. CODE  §  85.51(15);  Exhibit  1.    Like \n“Correctional  Therapy,”  sex  offender  treatment  also  requires  the  child  discuss  the  charged \noffense.  TYC will not even allow A.B. to enroll in the program because he will not admit he \ncommitted the offense.  Exhibit 4, Affidavit of A.B.   \n  TYC refuses to allow A.B. to participate in “Correctional Therapy” and sex offender \ntreatment because he is asserting his rights under the Fifth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  Participation in both the “Correctional Therapy” program and TYC’s Sex Offender \nTreatment Program require children to forego their Fifth Amendment rights to enter the program.  \nTYC does not grant children immunity for statements made during “Correctional Therapy” or \n3 The Minimum Length of Stay is determined according to TYC policy.  37 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 85.25 (2007).  \nA.B. completed his minimum sentence on November 6, 2007.  See Exhibit 1; Exhibit 3, Correspondence between \nTYC and Scott Medlock, counsel for A.B. \n5\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 6 of 15\nsex offender treatment, and the communications are not privileged or confidential.  Because he \ncannot discuss the offense he was adjudicated of committing until his appeal is resolved, A.B. \ncannot progress beyond phase “C-2” in the “Correctional Therapy” component, and TYC will \nnot even allow him to enroll in the Sex Offender Treatment Program.   \n  A.B. has successfully completed the “A” and “B” components of TYC’s rehabilitation \nprogram.  A.B. earned his G.E.D. to complete the “A,” or “Academic” component, and was the \nvaledictorian of his class in TYC.  See Exhibit 1 (“[A.B.] has achieved his G.E.D.  His teachers \ncommented he works hard in class…”); Exhibit 4.  TYC will not allow A.B. to take college-level \ncoursework  while  he  remains  incarcerated.    See  Exhibit  4;  Exhibit  5,  Youth  Complaint \nResolution Form (“College classes will not be offered for the fall semester”).  A.B. has not \ncommitted any major disciplinary violations in TYC custody, allowing him to obtain phase “B-\n4” in the “Behavior” component.  See Exhibit 1.  A.B. is frequently asked by TYC staff to assist \nwith work in the facility, such as serving other children food.  A.B. was even designated by TYC \nto distribute grievance forms to other children, an important position of trust.  See Exhibit 4. \n  On November 1, 2007, TYC convened a panel of its staff to consider releasing A.B. on \nparole. See Exhibit 4.  On November 5, 2007, TYC told A.B. he would be released to parole on \nNovember 14, 2007.  TYC had A.B. sign documents related to his sex offender registration, \nwhich  indicate  he  would  be  released  on  November  14,  2007.    See Exhibit  6,  Pre-Release \nNotification Form (“Not later than the 7th day after 11-14-07 (date of release/placement on \ncommunity supervision or juvenile probation), I must personally appear at the following local \nlaw enforcement authority to verify and complete my registration…”).  While on parole, A.B. \nwould be required to attend out-patient sex offender treatment therapy, see his parole officer \nregularly, obey various parole conditions, and register as a sex offender.  TYC will not allow \n6\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 7 of 15\nA.B.  to  participate  further  in  its  rehabilitation  programs  because  he  is  asserting  his  Fifth \nAmendment rights.  As such, the plans for release were cancelled. \n  A.B. has attempted to resolve these issues through TYC’s internal grievance procedure.  \nSee Exhibit 7, Correspondence from Dana Brockway to TYC, February 5, 2007; Exhibit 8, \nCorrespondence from TYC to Dana Brockway, February 5, 2007; Exhibit 9, Correspondence \nfrom Dana Brockway to TYC, March 20, 2007; Exhibit 10, Correspondence from Ed Owens to \nDana Brockway, April 16, 2007.\nARGUMENT\nA federal court should grant a preliminary injunction when the movant has clearly carried \nthe burden of persuasion on all four of the following prerequisites: (1) a substantial threat that \nPlaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (2) a substantial likelihood \nthat Plaintiff will prevail on the merits, (3) the threatened injury to Plaintiff outweighs the \nthreatened harm to the Defendants, and (4) granting the preliminary injunction will not disserve \nthe public interest.  See Mississippi Women’s Med. Clinic v. McMillan, 866 F.2d 788, 790 (5th \nCir. 1989).  Because the Defendants are public institutions, the third and fourth elements are \nproperly considered together.  See Spiegel v. City of Houston, 636 F.2d 997, 1002 (5th Cir. \n1981).  A.B. satisfies each element necessary for a preliminary injunction. \n1.  Plaintiff Will Suffer Irreparable Injury if the Court Does Not Enjoin Defendants from \nEnforcing Their Unconstitutional Policy \nA.B. will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, for which he has no adequate remedy \nat  law,  if  this  Court  does  not  immediately  prevent  Defendants  from  enforcing  their \nunconstitutional policy.  TYC’s policy both prohibits A.B. from being paroled and denies him \naccess to the treatment guaranteed by the Constitution.  The requested injunction is necessary to \nprotect A.B.’s constitutional right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself, and his \nright to receive treatment in TYC’s facilities.  “Violation[s] of constitutional rights constitute[] \n7\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 8 of 15\nirreparable harm as a matter of law.”  Cohen v. Coahoma Co., 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20844, \n*24 (N.D. Miss. 1992) (citing Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74 (1976)).  “Irreparable injury \nis established upon movants showing constitutionally protected rights have been violated.”  See\nMurillo v. Musegades, 809 F.Supp. 487, 497 (W.D. Tex. 1992) (citing Mitchell v. Cuomo, 748 \nF.2d 804, 806 (2d Cir. 1984); Mendoza v. INS, 559 F.Supp. 842, 850 (W.D. Tex. 1982)).   \n2.  Plaintiff Will Prevail on the Merits Because TYC Violates A.B.’s Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights \n  A.B.  is  protected  by  the  Fifth  Amendment  from  TYC  compelling  him  to  make \nincriminating admissions.  TYC’s treatment program requires him to make such statements \ndespite the fact he has an active appeal of the adjudication in his criminal case.  If A.B. were to \nmake the statements TYC requires, they could be used against him in his challenge to the \ncriminal adjudication.  Moreover, because he is asserting his Fifth Amendment rights, TYC \ndenies A.B. the opportunity to participate in “correctional therapy” and sex offender treatment.  \nTYC is constitutionally required to provide A.B. access to its rehabilitative programs.  TYC’s \nrefusal to do so violates A.B.’s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.   \na.  TYC Policy Violates A.B.’s Fifth Amendment Rights \nThe Fifth Amendment states “no person … shall be compelled in any criminal case to be \na witness against himself.”  U.S.CONST.amend. V.  It was applied against the states through the \nFourteenth Amendment in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964), where the privilege to remain \nsilent was recognized as an independent liberty interest.  The Supreme Court has extended this \nprotection to a number of situations where incriminating statements could be used against a \nperson in future criminal proceedings.  “The Amendment not only protects the individual being \ninvoluntarily called as a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also privileges him \nnot to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or \ninformal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.”  Lefkowitz v. \n8\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 9 of 15\nTurley, 414 U.S. 70, 76 (1973).  See also Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass’n. v. Comm’r of \nSanitation, 392 U.S. 280 (1968) (loss of employment); Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511 (1967) \n(disbarment).  A.B.’s Fifth Amendment rights extend after his adjudication.  The State cannot \n“call  for  answers  that  would  incriminate  him  in  a  pending  or  later  criminal  prosecution.”  \nMinnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 435 (1984).  The Supreme Court has clearly stated “the \nprivilege against self-incrimination does not terminate at the jailhouse door.”  McKune v. Lile,\n536 U.S. 24, 36 (2002) (Kennedy, J., for plurality).\nTYC has placed A.B. in a classic “speak or be punished” situation.  See Chapman v. \nState, 115 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).  A person cannot be compelled to bear witness \nagainst themselves when doing so results in an automatic penalty.  Id.  “A command to speak, \nunder the threat of loss of liberty, implicitly forecloses the option of remaining silent.”  Montana\nv. Fuller, 915 P.2d 809 (Mont. 1996).  “[A] State may not impose substantial penalties because a \nwitness elects to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to give incriminating testimony against \nhimself.”  Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 429 (1984) (citing Lefkowitz, 414 U.S. at 805).  \nThe Supreme Court has held “If [a person] asserts the privilege, he ‘may not be required to \nanswer a question if there is some rational basis for believing that it will incriminate him, at least \nwithout at that time being assured that neither it nor its fruits may be used against him’ in \nsubsequent criminal proceedings.”  Murphy, 465 U.S. at 429 (emphasis in original) (citing \nManess v. Meyers, 419 US 449, 473 (1975)).  \nThe Supreme Court directly addressed the question of whether an adult inmate can be \ncompelled to participate in sex offender treatment therapy when doing so would require making \ndamaging admissions that could be used against him in subsequent criminal proceedings.  In \nMcKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24 (2002), a plurality of four justices determined an adult inmate could \nbe compelled to participate in sex offender treatment programs by restricting his access to prison \n9\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 10 of 15\nprivileges, such as “visitation rights, earnings, work opportunities, ability to send money to \nfamily, canteen expenditures, access to a personal television, and other privileges.” McKune,\n536 U.S. at 31.  The plurality determined denying an inmate these minor privileges was not a \ndeprivation of liberty under the Sandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472 (1995), “atypical and significant \nhardship” standard.  The Court would, however, likely rule differently in this case.  Justice \nKennedy’s opinion for the plurality specifically states “respondent’s decision not to participate in \nthe [program] did not extend his term of incarceration.  Nor did his decision affect his eligibility \nfor good-time credits or parole.”  McKune, 536 U.S. at 38 (Kennedy, J., emphasis added).  \nJustice O’Connor agreed with the plurality that the loss of privileges in McKune was not enough \nto constitute compulsion, noting, however, that “some penalties are so great as to ‘compel’ such \ntestimony, while others do not rise to that level.”  McKune, 536 U.S. at 49 (O’Connor, J., \nconcurring  in  the  result).    Justice  O’Connor  specifically  noted  if  the  penalty  was  “longer \nincarceration” then the statements would be “compelled.”  Id. at 52.  A four justice minority \nargued in dissent that even denying the inmate access to those minimal privileges violated his \nFifth Amendment rights.  McKune, 536 U.S. at 49 (Stevens, J., dissenting). \nState supreme courts that have considered the issue have determined extending an adult \ninmate’s  incarceration  because  he  or  she  refuses  to  make  incriminating  statements  in  sex \noffender treatment programs is unconstitutional.  Johnson v. Fabian, 735 N.W.2d 295 (Minn. \n2007); Montana v. Fuller, 915 P.2d 809 (Mont. 1996).  Other federal courts have come to the \nsame conclusion.  See United States v. Antelope, 395 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2004) (extending \ninmate’s  sentence  for  refusal  to  participate  in  sex  offender  treatment  unconstitutional); \nDonhauser v. Goord, 314 F.Supp.2d 219 (N.D. N.Y. 2004) (sex offender treatment program \nunconstitutional  when  failure  to  participate  forfeits  “good  time”  credits  toward  parole), \nremanded for further proceedings at 181 Fed. Appx. 11 (2d Cir. 2006).  Unlike the adult inmate \n10\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 11 of 15\nin McKune, A.B. is not being denied a television in his cell—he is being denied release to parole \nand access to TYC’s rehabilitation programs.   \nb. TYC Policy Violates A.B.’s Fourteenth Amendment Rights to Rehabilitation \nTYC is required to provide A.B. appropriate treatment as a condition of his incarceration.  \nTYC’s statutory purpose is “to provide a program of constructive training aimed at rehabilitation \nand re-establishment in society of children adjudged delinquent by the courts of this state.”  TEX.\nHUM. RES. CODE ANN. § 61.002 (Vernon 2007).  Because TYC’s purpose is to rehabilitate\nchildren like A.B., and not to punish them, A.B. has a Fourteenth Amendment right to receive \ntreatment during his incarceration.  TYC cannot force A.B. to surrender his Fifth Amendment \nrights in order to receive treatment. \nUnlike adult inmates in the adult prison system, children held in TYC custody have a \nright  to  receive  rehabilitative  services.    “[A]n  institutionalized  juvenile  in  Texas  has  a \nconstitutional  and  statutory  right  to  receive  effective  and  adequate  treatment.”   Morales  v. \nTurman, 383 F.Supp. 53, 118 (E.D. Tex. 1974), rev'd on other grounds, 535 F.2d 864 (5th Cir. \n1976), rev'd per curiam, 430 U.S. 322, (1977).  “Juvenile courts were created for treatment and \nrehabilitation of juvenile offenders and this focus on the best interest of the child through \ntreatment  sets  juveniles  apart  from  regular  criminal  courts  which  directed  their  efforts  at \npunishing the offender.” In the matter of J.S.S., 20 S.W.3d 837 (Tex. App. – El Paso 2000).  \nTYC violates children’s constitutional rights when it does not provide them required treatment.  \n“Where the State, as parens patriae, imposes such detention, it can meet the Constitution’s \nrequirement of due process and prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment if, and only if, it \nfurnishes adequate treatment to the detainee.”  Morgan v. Sproat, 432 F.Supp. 1130, 1136 (N.D. \nMiss. 1977) (citing Martarella v. Kelley, 349 F.Supp. 575, 585 (S.D. N.Y. 1972)).\n11\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 12 of 15\nThe federal courts have previously required TYC to provide treatment to the children in \nits custody.  “The basis for commitment [to TYC custody]—to rehabilitate and re-establish the \njuvenile in society—is clearly grounded in a parens patriae rationale.  Thus, under the parens\npatriae theory, the juvenile must be given treatment lest the involuntary commitment amount to \nan arbitrary exercise of governmental power proscribed by the due process clause.”  Morales,\n383 F.Supp. at 71.  “Appropriate treatment is essential to the validity of juvenile custody, and \ntherefore that a juvenile may challenge the validity of his custody on the ground that he is not in \nfact receiving any special treatment.”  Id. (citing In re Gault, 387 US 1, 22 (1967)).\nFurthermore, A.B. is entitled to be held in the least restrictive setting possible while \nreceiving the treatment because he was civilly committed to TYC to receive rehabilitation, not \ncriminally convicted to be punished.  The Supreme Court held in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. \n307, 324 (1982), that civilly committed persons “thus [enjoy] constitutionally protected interests \nin conditions of reasonable care and safety, reasonably non-restrictive confinement conditions, \nand such training as may be required by these interests.”  A secure facility, such as where A.B. is \ncurrently held, is not the appropriate least restrictive setting for him to receive treatment.  “When \nthe state chooses, for the most humane motives, to offer or require institutional confinement of a \nperson, it must consider means that are capable of achieving its purposes in ways that are least \nstifling to personal liberty, and it must offer a therapeutic consideration, a quid pro quo, for the \ndeprivation.” Gary W. v. Louisiana, 437 F.Supp. 1209, 1217 (E.D. La. 1976).  Ms. Brockway \nhas arranged for A.B. to see a respected sex offender treatment professional in the community \nshould he be released.  Exhibit 11, Affidavit of Dana Brockway.  A.B.’s progress in the other \naspects of TYC’s treatment program demonstrate he does not need to be held in a secure facility \nduring the completion of his treatment.   \n12\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 13 of 15\n3.  Protection of A.B.’s Rights Serves the Public Interest, and Outweighs Any Harm to TYC\n  The public interest is always served by the protection of constitutional rights.  See, e.g.,\nCohen v. Coahoma Co., 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 208044, *25 (N.D. Miss. 1992) (rights of \nprisoners); Murillo v. Musegades, 809 F.Supp. 487, 498 (W.D. Tex. 1992) (Fifth Amendment \nrights) (citing Electronic Data Sys. Corp. Iran v. Social Sec. Org. of Gov’t of Iran, 508 F.Supp. \n1350, 1358 (N.D. Tex. 1981)).  It is further in the public interest to assure individuals such as \nA.B. are returned “to society as good citizens living life on the right side of the law.”  Ferguson\nv. Ashcroft, 248 F.Supp.2d 547, 556 (M.D. La. 2003).  Continuing to incarcerate A.B. without \nproviding him the rehabilitative services required by the Fourteenth Amendment disserves the \npublic interest. \n  Any interest TYC has in continuing to incarcerate A.B. does not outweigh the protection \nof the rights afforded him under the Constitution.  Continuing to house him in a secure facility, \nas opposed to a less restrictive facility, places A.B. in ongoing physical danger.  TYC does not \nemploy a custodial classification system to separate low-risk children, such as A.B., from high-\nrisk, violent children. See, e.g., Exhibit 12, Texas State Auditor’s Office, An Investigative \nReport on the Texas Youth Commission, at 1 (March 16, 2007) (“As many as 24 youths of \nvarious ages and levels of offenses sleep in the same room”).  A.B. has been assaulted on \nmultiple occasions in TYC’s facilities, suffering physical injuries.  Exhibit 4.   \nMoreover, TYC will, in some situations, waive the requirement that children receive \ntreatment before they can be released on parole.  37 TEX.ADMIN.CODE § 87.55 (2007) (waiving \ntreatment requirements when “due to staff vacancies, program closures, or insufficient agency \nresources, participation in the program will extend the youth’s length of stay” or if “the youth is \nunable  to  participate  in  specialized  treatment  due  to  a  medical,  mental  health,  or  mental \nretardation condition”).  Though this waiver policy does not apply by its terms to A.B., its \n13\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 67      Filed 11/19/2007     Page 14 of 15\nexistence demonstrates that continuing to incarcerate all children who have completed all but sex \noffender treatment is unnecessary.   \nGranting Plaintiff Dana Brockway’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction will serve the \npublic interest and the benefits to A.B. outweigh any imagined harm to TYC.   \nCONCLUSION \n  Therefore, Plaintiff Dana Brockway pleads the Court set her Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction for an evidentiary hearing, and after the hearing, issue an injunction against Defendant \nOwens and TYC prohibiting Defendants from: \n1. Considering  A.B.’s  assertion  of  his  Fifth  Amendment  rights  when  making \ndecisions about releasing him on parole; \n2. Denying  A.B.  participation  in  TYC’s  correctional  therapy  program  and  sex \noffender treatment program; and, \n3. Housing  A.B.  in  a  secure  facility  during  the  completion  of  the  treatment \nprograms.   \nDated: November 19, 2007. \nGeoffrey Neil Courtney  \nTexas Bar.

In light of the \nsettlement, all parties agree that no resources should be expended in preparing these pleadings. \nThe parties therefore respectfully request that the Court remove the April 17, 2008 deadline and \nthat the Court extend the stay currently in effect for this case until further order of the Court. \nThe parties  also  respectfully request  that the  Court  schedule  a  status  conference  in \napproximately 120 days (i.e., early August) so that the parties can either present dismissal papers \nor apprise the Court of the status of finalizing the settlement. \nThe parties have conferred with counsel for all other Defendants, and the relief requested \nin this Motion is unopposed. \n[SIGNATURE BLOCK TO FOLLOW ON NEXT PAGE] \n2 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 135   Filed 04/11/08   Page 3 of 5\nR  spectfully submitted, \n~\"\"'H-~___::___:::.=.-->.....:~~'-J~~+-c.J;~  0~ \n(>t/..4\"1'* ,. . ,, .. \nScott Ozmun \nState Bar No. 15392740 \nWHITEHURST, HARKNESS, OZMUN & BREES \n1122 Colorado, 24th Floor \nP.O.

Plaintiff Joseph Galloway, individually and on behalf of those similarly-situated, \ncomplains that the Texas Youth Commission (\"TYC\") and its current and former staff routinely \nand daily violated the federal statutory and constitutional rights of children incarcerated in TYC \nfacilities, and, in short, relegated their youthful lives to a living hell. \n2.  Defendants routinely denied Joseph and other children with qualified disabilities the \nreasonable accommodations to which they are entitled under Chapter 121 of the Texas Human \nResources Code (\"Chapter 121\"), Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. § 121.001 et seq., Title II of the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  12131  (\"ADA\"),  and  Section  504  of the \nRehabilitation Act  of 1973,  29  U.S.C.  § 794,  resulting  in physical  injuries  and  continued \nincarceration. \n3.  TYC employees, through custom, policy, and individual action, routinely physically \nand sexually assaulted, and allowed other inmates to assault, Joseph and other children, denied \nthem due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \ndenied their right to access to the courts under the First, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution and Article 1, Section 13 of the Texas Constitution, subjected them to \ncruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution and Article 1, Section 13 of the Texas Constitution, compelled them \nto bear witness against themselves in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \n-3-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 4 of 34\nUnited States Constitution and Article 1, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution, and retaliated \nagainst them for speaking about the problems in TYC in violation of the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 8 of the Texas Constitution. \nThese claims are brought through 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n4.  Defendants Dwight Harris, Freeman, Nicholson, Parsee, Caldwell, Bernard, Clay, \nDavidson, Brantley, and Reyes conspired for years to suppress reports of the violations of Joseph \nand other children's statutory and constitutional rights.  These claims are brought pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1985(2). \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs claims under 28 U.S.C. §§1331, 2201. \n6.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §1391(a)(I) & (2) because TYC's \ncentral office and operational, decision-making center is located in this judicial district, because \nsome of the Defendants reside in this district, and because incidents at bar took place within this \njudicial district.  Plaintiff further invokes supplemental jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367(a) to consider his state law claims. \nPARTIES \n7.  At  the  time  of the  below-described  incidents,  Joseph  was  an  inmate  in  TYC \ncustody.  Similarly situated-children remain in TYC custody, although Joseph has been released \nand now resides in Houston County, Texas. \n8.  Defendant TYC is an agency of the State of Texas. \n9.

Joseph and the similarly-situated class members comprise a class of approximately \n4,700 individuals who are currently or were recently in TYC custody. \n38.  Joseph and the  class members  meet all  the prerequisites  for  a class  action as \nprovided under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 for injunctive and declaratory relief. \n39.  The class for which Joseph and the class members comprise is so numerous that \n-7-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 8 of 34\njoinder of class members is impracticable. \n40.  Questions of law and fact are common to this class, namely: \na.  TYC denies them due process of law through its indeterminate sentencing \nscheme; \nb.  TYC denies them access to courts through its policies and procedures; \nc.  TYC  violates  their  protections  against  self  incrimination  by  requiring \nconfessions as part of their \"therapy;\" \nd.  TYC  fails  to  protect  them  from  harm,  in  violation  of their  Eighth  and \nFourteenth Amendment rights; and, \ne.  Defendants Dwight Harris, Freeman, Nicholson, Parsee, Caldwell, Bernard, \nClay, Davidson, Brantley, and Reyes conspired to suppress reports of physical \nand sexual abuse occurring in TY C facilities. \n41.  Joseph and the class member's claims as described herein are typical of the claims \nof the class.  Together, Joseph and the class members support their theories for injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief on the same legal theories alleged in this case. \n42.  Joseph and his counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the other \nclass members.  Joseph's counsel, James C. Harrington, Wayne Krause, Sheri Tolliver, and Scott \nMedlock, are capable of zealously representing class interests and are qualified to litigate this \ntype of action.  Joseph and his counsel will adequately assert and support the legal claims that \nform the basis of this action.  Joseph and the students will benefit equally by virtue of this action \nif the Court recognizes and vindicates their federal statutory and constitutional rights. \n43.  This class action may be properly maintained under the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) because Defendants' conduct pursuant to their procedures, policies, and/or \npractices denied Joseph and the class members their constitutional rights and final declaratory \nrelief will settle the legality of the Defendants' challenged procedures, policies, and actions for \nthe class as a whole. \n-8-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 9 of 34\n44.  Joseph also brings his own claim for damages as an individual for the physical and \nsexual abuse he individually suffered while in TYC custody, separate from his claims as class \nrepresentative for injunctive and declaratory relief.  He seeks no damages for the class. \nFACTS \n45.  Joseph is nineteen years old and has been in TYC since he was fifteen.  When he \nwas eight years old, he spent time in a state mental hospital, where he was treated for bipolar \ndisorder.  Joseph  is  a  thin  teenager  and  also  has  Tourette's  Syndrome  and  Attention \nDeficitIHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). \n46.  Tourette's  Syndrome  is  characterized  by  a collection  of symptoms,  including \ninvoluntary movements and sounds and involuntary compulsive rituals and behaviors.  People \nwith  Tourette's  Syndrome  experience  obsessions,  compulsions,  inattention,  impulsivity  and \nmood variability.  The disability can cause people to involuntarily move, make loud noises, \nblink,  nod,  shake,  and  curse,  and  may  manifest  itself more  acutely  during  adolescence. \nTourette's Syndrome is a mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life \nactivities. \n47.  Joseph has been taking some form of medication for his disabilities since he was \nfive years old.  He currently takes Clonidine to control his Tourette's Syndrome.  Clonidine is a \npowerful drug that can cause drowsiness and dizziness. \n48.  Joseph has been incarcerated in four different TYC facilities: Marlin Orientation \nand  Assessment  Unit  (\"Marlin\"),  Giddings  State  School  (\"Giddings\"),  Evins  State  School \n(\"Evins\")  and  Crockett  State  School  (\"Crockett\").  He  was  most  recently  incarcerated  in \nCrockett. \n49.  When children enter TYC,  they  are  initially processed through Marlin.  Most \n-9-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 10 of 34\nchildren spend about two months in Marlin before they are sent to other facilities.  Joseph spent \napproximately forty-five days at Marlin. \n50.  During their time at Marlin, children are supposed to be tested and evaluated to \ndetermine how they will be rehabilitated.  Children are provided with an \"individualized case \nplan,\" or ICP. \n51.  TYC assembled Joseph's ICP without input from him or his parents.  In order to \nformulate  his ICP,  it limited all its testing and assessment on Joseph to his responses to a \ncomputer program.  He and his parents never spoke with a TYC counselor or caseworker about \nthe ICP, and TYC only tested Joseph to see if he had a learning disability or was mentally \nretarded.  The ICP did not consider Joseph's existing disabilities. \n52.  Most  children  in  TYC  are  incarcerated  for  an  indeterminate  sentence. \nTheoretically, children are only incarcerated until they are rehabilitated.  To be paroled, a child \nhas to complete their \"phases\" in TYC's \"Resocialization©\" program.  There are five phases (0-\n4), and each phase has three components (Academic, Behavior, and Correctional).  A child can \ncomplete one of their phases, and not advance in the others.  A child could succeed academically \nbut remain in TYC, ifTYC officials arbitrarily determine the child has a \"behavior problem.\" \n53.  Defendants Brantley and Reyes developed the \"Resocialization©\" program, and \nretain proprietary rights in the program.  Brantley and Reyes personally profit from  TYC's \ndecision to use the \"Resocialization©\" program, and have a personal financial interest in its \ncontinued use. \n54.  A disciplinary action against a youth is a \"225,\" named for the number of the form \ncompleted.  A 225 can be either a \"category 1\" or \"category 2.\"  Category 1 is \"major,\" and \nwould include assaulting a fellow student or an officer.  A \"category 2\" is \"minor,\" and would \n-10-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 11 of 34\ninclude using foul language. \n55.  Tye intentionally discriminates against children with disabilities by assigning them \n225s for manifestations of their disability.  Tye has given Joseph disciplinary actions for: \na.  Falling asleep after talcing his medication which makes him drowsy; \nb.  Playing with a banana; \nc.  Sitting in the wrong seat during church; \nd.  Wearing his socks pulled down; \ne.  Wearing pants that were too large, although Tye provided the pants to him; \nf.  Wearing an extra shirt when he was cold; \ng.  Wearing a long sleeve shirt when he was cold; \nh.  \"Acting out\" because of his disability; \ni.  Having cornflakes in his bowl of milk when he was on a \"soft food\" diet; \nj.  Looking out the window during class; and, \nk.  Shalcing hands with another child. \n56.  To complete the \"B\" phase, children must pass through four levels.  To achieve the \n\"B-1\" phase, a child cannot have more than seven \"category 2\"s and no \"category 1\" s in a \nmonth.  To achieve the \"B-2\" phase, a child cannot have more than five \"category 2\"s in a month \nand  no  \"category  1\" s.  To  achieve the \"B-3\" phase,  a child cannot have more than three \n\"category 2\"s, and no more than one \"category 2\" to achieve the \"B-4\" phase.  The \"B\" phase is \nreviewed every 30 days, and each month's number of 225s determines \"graduation\" to the next \nphase.  A child can only be promoted through one \"phase\" each month, so it will take a child a \nminimum of four months to be promoted through the \"B\" component.  Tye refused to promote \nJoseph through his \"B\" phase for being \"playful and immature,\" even though Joseph's disability \n-11-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 12 of 34\nand age contributed to his \"playful and immature\" behavior. \n57.  ro complete the \"C\" phase, a child must identify the \"errors in [their] thinking\". \nCompletion of the \"C\" phase does not constitute actual mental health therapy because ryC \n\"therapists\" only require students to memorize and recite a \"script.\"  ryc \"therapists\" are not \ncredentialed  to  provide  mental  health  therapy  or  trained  to  recognize  children's  mental \ndisabilities. \n58.  \"C-l\" requires memorizing \"nine thinking errors.\"  \"C-2\" requires a child to write \nand memorize their \"life story.\"  \"C-3\" requires a child to talk about their \"offense.\"  This \ninvolves other children ridiculing the student during group therapy.  The ''therapist'' reads the \ngroup  the  police  investigation  statements  and  victim  impact  statements  from  the  student's \noffense, although these documents are confidential under rexas Government Code § 508.313. \nThe other members of the group then \"make fun\" of the student, and a child advances to the next \nphase only when they show sufficient \"empathy,\" as arbitrarily determined by ryc.  \"C-4\" \nrequires developing a \"success plan,\" which outlines what the child will do when they leave \nryc custody.  Despite requiring children to formulate \"success plans,\" ryc provides children \nwith no support once they leave prison. \n59.  ryC requires children to \"confess\" to elements of their offenses that were not the \nsubject of fmdings by the trial court.  In some cases, these \"confessions\" are later used against \nthe child or the child's parents in Child Protective Services investigations or future criminal \nproceedings.  If a child's confession does not satisfy rYC, the sentence can be extended.  A child \nwill only be released when ryc is satisfied the child has fully \"confessed,\" even if this means \nadmitting things that are not true, were not found by the family court that sentenced the child, \nand could subject the child or parents to future legal consequences. \n-12-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 13 of 34\n60.  Due  to  the  discrimination  against  Joseph's  disability  and  violations  of his  due \nprocess rights, Joseph should have been released years earlier.  Instead, ryc illegally held him \ncaptive in its hellish system, thereby depriving him of his youth and subjecting him to abuse by \nits employees and detainees. \n61.  Joseph completed his \"phases\" in 2006 but his caseworker, Defendant Penuelas, \nadmitted that Defendants \"never put it in the computer system.\"  ryC does not have centralized \nrecord keeping or data collection indicating what phases have been completed.  ryc only keeps \ncentralized records  of the  number of 225s a student has  accumulated.  When children are \ntransferred between ryc facilities, their records do not always transfer with them.  ryc keeps \nthe records in a physical file that guards are required to move with the child during transport. \nRecords are frequently lost because of this system.  rransfer between facilities can dramatically \nextend a child's incarceration.  This basic record keeping failure requires children to complete \ntheir \"phases\" multiple times and delays their release from ryc.  ryc should have released \nJoseph long ago.  But even by its own discriminatory practices, the latest release date would have \nbeen October 26,2006.  ryc failed to release him until AprilS, 2007. \n62.  When Joseph arrived at Crockett, he told officials he had completed his \"phases\" \nand should be released.  The finals steps of Joseph's \"reintegration\" had already been completed. \nDefendants told Joseph he was \"making excuses\" for why he had not been released and that it \nwas his fault he was still in ryc. \n63.  ryc has taken Joseph's \"phases\" away without due process.  Removing his phases \nwas arbitrary and capricious.  Joseph once went from B-4 to B-1  without due process, even \nthough it originally had taken him fourteen months to achieve B-1.  When a \"phase\" is taken \naway, there is usually no due process hearing.  Joseph was never provided with counsel for a \n-13-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 14 of 34\nhearing, and, when he was a minor his parents were never informed of the hearings. \nrye \n64.  only provides a due process hearing when a student is given a \"category 1\" \n225, even though \"category 2\" 225s are frequently used to extend a child's sentence.  When a \n\"level 2\" hearing is held for a \"category 1\" 225, the decision-makers are the superintendent, \nprogram associates, and caseworker at the facility.  These individuals are not impartial, and \nrye \nfrequently are the same  officials whose allegations form the basis of the complaint.  When \nhearings are held, staff frequently refuse to allow witnesses to be called who would support a \nchild's position. \nrye \n65.  Most children are told they will receive nine months in  custody when a judge \nrye  rye \nsentences them.  When children arrive in  custody,  staff uniformly tell them they will \nserve at least two years.  When a child complains that a judge only sentenced him to nine \nrye  rye.  rye \nmonths,  staff have responded, \"Judges don't make rules for  makes its own \nrules.\" \n66.  While he was at Marlin, Joseph was sent to security for \"disrespecting staff' in \nSpring 2003.  Disturbed by the combination of his incarceration, difficult past, disabilities, and \nchanged circumstances, he had been reduced to beating on the wall in his cell.  The security \ndirector at the prison taunted Joseph, cajoling him to \"keep standing up\" and \"keep beating on \nthat.\" \n67.  Defendants Shacklefield and Williams were called to take Joseph out of his cell. \nThey came in the cell and hit Joseph in the face with their riot shield, breaking his nose and \ncausing serious physical injury.  Defendants knocked Joseph unconscious.  He woke up in a pool \nof his own blood, with more running down his face and allover his shirt.  Defendants carried \nhim out ofthe cell in leather restraints to the infirmary. \n-14-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 15 of 34\n68.  In the infirmary, TYC nurses told Joseph his nose was broken, but only gave him \ntoilet paper to stop the bleeding.  When he was taken back to his cell, he saw in the mirror his \nnose was crooked and continuing to bleed.  Defendants having been deliberately indifferent to \nhis injuries, Joseph had to pop his nose back into place himself.  TYC videotaped this incident. \n69.  Because of this incident, Joseph was placed on \"BMP,\" the \"Behavior Management \nProgram.\"  BMP is \"isolation\"-students are taken out of the \"dorm\" and placed in segregation \ncells.  Students are only supposed to spend two weeks in BMP.  Joseph was in BMP for almost \nthree weeks.  Children have to \"eam their way out\" of BMP, as arbitrarily determined by TYC. \nOnly a \"level 2\" hearing takes place before children are put in BMP.  TYC fails to provide \nparents notice of their children's hearings, and students are not provided counsel before entering \nBMP.  Shacklefield told Joseph he was kept on BMP so long because the \"paperwork was lost.\" \n70.  Joseph was transferred to Giddings after he left Marlin.  He spent approximately \nthree years and three months at Giddings, from mid-2003 until April 2006. \n71.  When Joseph was first at Giddings, he was living in Dorm 8.  Female staffworked \nin the dorm.  Joseph had ajob as a \"kitchen boy,\" and would clean up the kitchen, buff the floors \nand launder clothes from the kitchen. \n72.  Joseph was putting clothes in the washer when Defendant Delgado approached him. \nShe told him, \"It's my turn to touch you.\"  She grabbed his crotch and felt his penis.  She started \nsqueezing his penis through his clothes.  Delgado deliberately and intentionally performed oral \nsex on Joseph, even though he was underage and in custody.  Delgado intentionally violated \nTexas Penal Code §§ 21.11 (indecency with a child) and 39.04(a)(2) (improper sexual activity \nwith person in custody). \n73.  Delgado told Joseph not to tell anyone about what happened.  She never worked in \n-15-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 16 of 34\nDonn 8 again after it happened.  She had sex with other male inmates at Giddings. \nrye \n74.  Around December 2003,  allowed another inmate to rape Joseph at Giddings. \nMr. Henry escorted Joseph back to the single cells.  When Henry took Joseph to the cells, they \nwere all filled with other detainees.  Some inmates were yelling to Henry, \"Put him in with me!\" \nand \"I want a piece of ass!\"  Henry chose to put Joseph in a cell with a large, older inmate named \nSteven, in spite of the fact that Steven yelled at Henry he that planned to rape Joseph. \n75.  Henry put Joseph in the cell, and made Joseph take offhis clothes for a strip search \nin front of the threatening rapist.  Henry forced Joseph to strip and bend over in full view of \nSteven.  Then Henry deserted Joseph while he was putting his clothes back on in the cell. \n76.  Steven told Joseph to take his clothes back off.  Joseph refused.  Steven punched \nJoseph twice in the head.  Joseph fell down.  Joseph tried to fight back, but Steven was much \nlarger and stronger.  Steven turned Joseph around and took offhis pants.  Joseph told him, \"Stop, \ndon't do it.\"  Steven continued punching Joseph.  Joseph told him to stop, but Steven sodomized \nhim multiple times, causing serious physical injury. \n77.  Steven told Joseph, \"Don't worry, 1 won't tell anyone.\"  Joseph was afraid to report \nrye \nwhat Steven did to him because he would be considered a \"snitch,\" and  guards would not \nprotect him from further assault.  Joseph spent the next twenty-four hours in the same cell with \nhis rapist. \nrye \n78.  guards, including Henry, are supposed to check the cells every fifteen minutes. \nMany guards forge their log sheets and only actually perfonn checks every hour.  While Joseph \nrye \nwas being raped,  guards failed to check his hallway and failed to protect him.  Henry was \nin another hall between two solid doors.  Despite knowing Steven planned to rape Joseph, Henry \nplaced Joseph in the cell and left the area.  Henry was deliberately indifferent to Joseph's right to \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 17 of 34\nbe protected from rape. \n79.  The same night, a few hours later, Henry took Joseph out of the cell to shower.  He \nsaw Joseph's underwear was covered in blood, and asked him, \"What's wrong with your ass?\" \nHenry did not report that Joseph may have been sexually assaulted to anyone, even though he \nhad obvious cause to believe Joseph had been raped and even though he had an obligation to \nreport the sexual assault pursuant to Texas Family Code § 261.101.  After Joseph showered, \nHenry returned him to the cell with Steven for another fifteen hours. \n80.  Steven took Joseph's food that night, so Joseph did not get to eat.  Larger, stronger \ninmates frequently steal food from smaller, weaker students.  TYC guards know this takes place, \nbut are deliberately indifferent to it. \n81.  A few weeks later, Joseph went to the infirmary after complaining of blood in his \nstool.  The nurses failed to report that Joseph may have been sexually assaulted, even though \nthey had cause to believe he was a victim of sexual assault and were required to report suspected \nchild abuse pursuant to Texas Family Code § 261.101.  No forensic rape examination was done, \nand Joseph was only given Metamucil for \"constipation.\" \n82.  Joseph continues to suffer a serious ongoing physical injury because of Henry's \ndeliberate indifference.  A few weeks after Joseph was raped, Henry committed suicide. \n83.  Records indicate Joseph was also sexually abused by TYC staff during transport \nbetween TYC facilities in the back of a van. \n84.  In February 2006, Joseph attempted suicide twice at Giddings.  He was depressed, \ndwelling on what had happened to him in the hands of Defendants.  TYC had caused Joseph to \nlose his phase and once again did not allow him to go home.  He had to call his parents and tell \nthem he would not be coming home again.  Joseph felt that he would never get out of TYC. \n~17~ \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 18 of 34\n85.  During the  ftrst  suicide  attempt,  Joseph cut his wrists  several times,  causing a \nphysical injury.  A guard, Defendant Rangel, found him.  Rangel refused to take him to the \ninftrmary.  Rangel told Joseph the wounds were \"not bad.\"  That night, when the pill call nurse \ncame by, Joseph showed her the wounds were \"green,\" and he was belatedly taken to  the \ninftrmary.  Joseph still has scars on his wrists from this suicide attempt. \n86.  During the second attempt, Joseph tried to hang himself.  He had taken threads from \nhis mattress and braided them together into a two-foot rope.  He tied the rope around his neck, \nand passed out, causing physical injury.  Defendant Dwayne Harris, the security director at \nGiddings, responded to the celL  He told the guards and nurses Joseph was \"faking\" and ''there's \nnothing wrong.\"  This time, the nurses took Joseph to the inftrmary anyway. \n87.  ryC does not classify children according to offense or propensity for violence. \nryc houses physically small and vulnerable children as young as ten years old in the same \n\"dorms\" as much older, larger children, some of whom are twenty years old.  ryc houses \nchildren accused  of non-violent offenses,  like  graffiti  or theft,  with  others who  have been \ninvolved in murder or sexual assault. \n88.  ryc transferred Joseph to its Evins facility in Spring of 2006.  ryc moved Joseph \nto Evins, far away from his family, after Joseph's mother began to complain about the conditions \nin ryc facilities.  Because ryC retaliated against Joseph, his family was not able to see him as \nfrequently as when ryC housed Joseph at Giddings.  ryc retaliated against Joseph because he \nand his family exercised their free speech and expression rights. \n89.  Most of the students at Evins are members of racial minority groups.  Joseph is \nCaucasian.  When Joseph fIrst arrived at Evins, he was placed in protective custody, but then was \nkicked out by a guard who did not like him. \n-18-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 19 of 34\n90.  At Evins, TYC staff encouraged students to fight.  You have to \"prove you are not a \nbitch.\"  The United States Department of Justice issued a finding letter in 2007 concluding, \n\"Conditions at Evins violate the constitutional rights of the youth residents .... Children at Evins \nare not adequately protected from harm.\" The Department of Justice wrote: \n\"Our investigation revealed an unacceptably high rate of youth violence at Evins. \nThe atmosphere at Evins is chaotic and dangerous.  Youths frequently fight with \neach other without detection or intervention by staff.  Staff members and youths \nwe interviewed consistently reported that staff members are unable to manage \nyouths' behavior due to inadequate staffing.  According to information provided \nby TYC, there were 1,025 reported youth-on-youth assaults at Evins in 2005, an \navemge of 2.8 per day.  For the first six months of 2006, there were 568 reported \nyouth-on-youth assaults, an average of 3.1 per day.  This frequency of assaults is \na  substantial  departure  from  generally  acceptable  professional  standards. \nNationally, facilities  compamble to  Evins typically report an average  of .241 \nyouth on youth assaults per 100 days of confinement which, for Evins, correlates \nto 1.235 assaults per 100 days of confmement.  Thus, the average rate of assaults \nat Evins is approximately five times the national avemge.\" \nDefendant  Caldwell  is  the  superintendent  at  Evins,  and  is  delibemtely  indifferent to  these \nconditions. \n91.  At Giddings, TYC guards encourage children to participate in \"Gladiator Night.\" \nTYC guards encourage children to tie a sock around their ankles, fight and physically injure \nother children who try to take the sock off.  TYC guards allow inmates to assault and physically \ninjure  students  who  refuse  to  participate  in  Gladiator Night.  Defendants  are  deliberately \nindifferent to children's rights to be protected from harm. \n92.  Children in TYC rarely get in trouble for fighting.  Joseph recalls the kitchen at \nGiddings was \"like a boxing ring.\"  Joseph estimates he has been in 60 fights since coming into \nTYC's custody.  Students are frequently physically injured because of fights in TYC facilities. \n93.  Joseph has gone to the infirmary many times for black eyes and broken noses from \nthese fights.  He has always told the nurses he \"fell in the shower\" or \"ran into my bunk\" because \n-19-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 20 of 34\nhe did not want to be a \"snitch.\"  Nurses failed to question these stories typical of abuse victims, \nand  these  incidents  were  never  investigated  or  reported,  even  though  nurses  had  a legal \nobligation to report the incidents under Texas Family Code § 261.101. \n94.  Staff searched the bunks of Joseph and another child at Evins.  Defendant Trevino \nfound a poem with racially charged words in the other child's bunk.  Trevino read the poem \naloud to the minority students, intending to incite them to attack Joseph.  Trevino threatened \nJoseph, telling him \"you're public enemy number one\" and ''this is campus wide.\" \n95.  TYC failed to place Joseph in protective custody, despite the guards' knowledge \nthreats were made against him.  Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Joseph's right to be \nprotected from harm. \n96.  That next morning, six unknown assailants attacked Joseph and the other child.  One \nof the assailants was an inmate who was much larger than Joseph.  Joseph's head was smashed \non the concrete and he blacked out, suffering a physical injury.  He woke up soon, and saw the \nother student being assaulted.  He tried to help him, and was beaten more.  He was kicked in the \nhead and mouth,  suffering serious physical injuries.  When the beating was  over,  a guard, \nDefendant Torres, told Joseph, \"That's what you get for writing racist shit.\"  Trevino and Torres \nencouraged the other students to assault Joseph, and were deliberately indifferent to Joseph's \nright to be protected from physical injury. \n97.  Joseph suffered physical injuries from the beating-the orbiter bone under his eye \nwas bruised, his jaw was broken, and he suffered a concussion.  Yet TYC guards failed to \nimmediately take Joseph or the other child, who also suffered physical injuries, to the infirmary. \n98.  When Joseph tried to eat breakfast the next morning, he could not do so because of \nterrible pain in his jaw.  His friend had to call security for him, and forty-five minutes later the \n-20-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 21 of 34\nnurses responded and took him to the infirmary.  Forty-five minutes after that, he was taken to \nthe emergency room in an ambulance, where his jaw was wired shut. \n99.  Joseph's mother reported the incident to TYC and several law enforcement agencies. \n100. A few days after this incident, Joseph was transferred from  Evins to  Crockett, \nwhich is nearer his parent's home. \n101.  Joseph began feeling nauseous at Crockett.  Wire cutters had been given to the \nsecurity staff in Joseph's part of the prison by the infirmary to cut the wires holding his jaw shut \nif he needed to vomit, because nausea is a common side effect of the pain medication.  Joseph \nwas unable to eat because of the wires, which increased his nausea.  When Joseph told the guard \nhe needed to vomit, the guard called Defendant McDaniels in the infirmary. McDaniels told the \nguard that when Joseph needed to vomit, Joseph did not need to have the wires cut-Joseph \ncould just \"hang his head upside down over the toilet, and let the vomit drip out.\"  Joseph had to \nhold his fingers down his throat to prevent himself from vomiting, because he believed if he did \nso he would inhale the vomit and die. \n102.  Joseph ripped the wires out because they were so painful and he was afraid he \ncould inhale his own vomit.  TYC nurses Defendants Kitchens and Gagne refused to give him \nhis prescribed painkillers on the prescribed schedule and were deliberately indifferent to his \npainful physical injury.  TYC gave Joseph three disciplinary actions for this incident, which \nextended his incarceration.  Defendants failed to provide Joseph with due process. \n103.  Joseph was eventually sent to UTMB in Galveston, where a doctor told him the \nwires were put in improperly.  It took two hours to rewire his jaw.  At Evins, he was prescribed \nTylenol 3, which contains codeine, and told to take it every three to four hours, or as needed. \nWhen he was transferred to Crockett, he was told he could only take it three times a day, and \n-21-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 22 of 34\nthen was only given half doses.  Defendants McDaniels and Gagne refused to give him the \nmedication,  despite  knowing  Joseph  was  in  obvious  pain.  McDaniels  and  Gagne  were \ndeliberately indifferent to Joseph's serious physical needs. \n104.  When Joseph was transported to UTMB  in Galveston,  Defendants Briggs and \nWatson tightly shackled his legs.  The shackles cut deeply into Joseph's legs, and his socks \nbecame very bloody.  Joseph still has scars on his ankles from these physical injuries. \n105.  ryC refused to house Joseph in the infirmary while his jaw was wired shut, where \nhe could have been under constant supervision by medical staff.  Defendants Gagne, Kitchens \nand McDaniels were deliberately indifferent to Joseph's serious medical problems by refusing to \nhouse him in the infirmary and refusing to cut the wires when he began to vomit. \n106.  During his incarceration in rye's custody, some of Joseph's adult teeth grew into \nhis mouth.  One tooth came out crooked, and emerged through the gum improperly.  rye knew \nthe tooth needed medical attention, and knew it caused Joseph physical pain and injury.  rye \ndeliberately refused to fix Joseph's tooth. \n107.  Days before Joseph was released, Defendant McQueen struck Joseph in the jaw. \nJoseph had picked up a tray to eat out of turn, acting impulsively because of his disability. \nRather than follow rye policy, which requires an attempt at a non-violent de-escalation of a \nsituation, McQueen struck Joseph in the  face.  Attempting to de-escalate the  situation is a \nreasonable accommodation for Joseph's disability.  Joseph suffered further physical injury to his \njaw, and was taken to the hospital for testing.  Joseph was given three 225s for this incident. \n108.  After  the  assault,  Joseph  asked  to  speak  with  his  mother  and  his  attorneys. \nDefendant Wilson told Joseph he would not be  allowed to  contact his mother or attorney. \nWilson threatened Joseph that he would not be released from ryC if he reported this incident. \n-22-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 23 of 34\n109.  Defendants Freeman and Nicholson put a \"hit\" out on Joseph shortly before he was \nreleased.  Freeman and Nicholson told ryc guards and inmates they could assault Joseph \nwithout consequence. \n110.  When Joseph began to discuss what happened to him in ryc with his attorneys, \nDefendant Wilson refused to allow him to have a confidential attorney/client phone call with his \nlawyer.  Despite requests from  his  counsel to  Defendants Freeman and  Wilson for  rYC's \npolicies and procedures related to attorney/client visits and phone calls, these policies were not \nprovided.  The first time Joseph's attorney attempted to speak with him on the telephone, Wilson \nrefused to leave the room and would not allow Joseph to confer with his attorney in private. \n111.  Joseph's attorneys mailed him confidential legal documents.  Unknown ryc staff \nopened this mail outside Joseph's presence, and read the confidential and privileged documents \ninside.  The envelope containing the documents was clearly marked \"legal mail\" on the front and \nback, but ryc staff deliberately disregarded these labels. \n112.  When Joseph told Defendant Wilson he wanted to report this abuse to the ryC \nhotline, she told him he could not call the hotline.  Wilson told Joseph if he reported his abuse, \nryc would extend his incarceration. \n113.  Defendants Dwight Harris, Freeman, Nicholson, Parsee, Caldwell, Bernard, Clay, \nDavidson, Brantley, and Reyes conspired to suppress reports of abuse and civil rights violations \nin ryc for years.  Parsee was arrested for obstruction of justice for his role in this conspiracy. \nDwight Harris, Freeman, Nicholson, Parsee, Caldwell, Bernard, Clay, Davidson, Brantley and \nReyes were deliberately indifferent to the conditions in ryC that violate children's statutory and \nconstitutional rights, including Plaintiff s. \n-23-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 24 of 34\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nI. DUE PROCESS OF LAW \n114.  TYC and Defendant Owens routinely deprive children in TYC custody of their \n\"phases\" without affording them due process of law, as required by the Fourteenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution.  Assigning a child a 225 will extend the child's sentence \nbecause it prevents them from achieving \"phase\" \"B-4\".  \"Category 2\" 225s are routinely and \narbitrarily given to children for trivial \"offenses,\" which extend the child's imprisonment. \n115.  TYC and Defendant Owens routinely deprive students of earned \"phases\" without \ndue process.  Depriving students of their \"phases\" increases their incarceration in TYC facilities. \n116. Any prison disciplinary action which would extend a child's sentence must be \naccompanied by due process.  Children are entitled to due process when a prison disciplinary \naction would extend the length of their sentence by any amount of time. \n117.  For \"category  I\" 225s  and placement in BMP,  a due process hearing  is held. \nChildren, however, must represent themselves at these proceedings.  Parents are not infonned \nthese  proceedings  are  taking  place,  or  that  these  proceedings  could  extend  the  child's \nincarceration.  Because  the  children are  minors,  they  are  legally  incapable  of representing \nthemselves in any proceeding that would alter any legal relationship.  TYC  and Defendant \nOwens fail to infonn parents of these proceedings and appoint counsel to represent the children. \n118.  Defendant Owens admits in the \"TYC Rehabilitation Plan,\" which he authored, that \n\"lack of standardized procedures\" results  in \"extending a youth's period of incarceration.\" \nOwens admits these extensions \"could be viewed as subjective and unnecessarily punitive.\" \n119.  Joseph brings these due process claims on behalf of the class members against \nDefendant Owens in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief only.  Defendant \n-24-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 25 of 34\nOwens admits \"approximately 190\" children in TYC's custody have \"satisfactorily completed \ntheir program requirements, but remain confined in TYC institutions.\" \n120. Joseph  brings  these  due  process  claims  in  his  individual  capacity  against \nDefendants Wilson  and Penuelas.  Wilson and  Penuelas refused to  process the  documents \ndemonstrating Joseph had completed his \"phases,\" which would allow him his release.  Wilson \nand Penuelas were deliberately indifferent to Joseph's due process rights, and intentionally and \nmaliciously deprived him of due process to extend his incarceration.  Joseph brings this claim in \nhis  individual  capacity  for  damages,  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief against  Wilson  and \nPenuelas in their individual and official capacities as TYC caseworkers. \nII. ACCESS TO COURTS \n121.  TYC  and  Defendant  Owens  fail  to  provide  children  in  their  custody  with \nmeaningful  access  to  courts  and  counsel,  as  required  by  the  First,  Sixth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  and  Article  1,  Section  13  of the  Texas \nConstitution.  TYC and Defendant Owens refuse to make policies and procedures for visitation \nand telephone calls available on request to children's attorneys. \n122.  TYC routinely reads confidential and privileged attorney/client mail, even when the \ncorrespondence is clearly marked \"legal mail.\"  TYC does not open the privileged mail only in \nthe child's presence, as required by the United States Constitution. \n123.  TYC denies children the ability to confer in private with their attorneys.  TYC does \nnot allow children to make telephone calls to their attorneys, and requires a caseworker to \"sit \nin\" on attorney/client phone calls, even when the phone call was scheduled a week in advance \nand confirmed by correspondence. \n124.  Joseph brings these access-to-courts claims on behalf of the class members against \n-25-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 26 of 34\nDefendant Owens in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief only. \n125.  Joseph also brings these access-to-courts claims in his individual capacity against \nDefendant Wilson.  Wilson refused to allow Joseph to speak with his attorney in private. \nIII. SELF-INCRIMINATION \n126.  TYC  and Defendant Owens  require  children to  confess to  facts  that were not \nadjudicated by their trial court as part of the \"therapy\" they receive while in TYC's custody. \nThese \"confessions\" are required before students can be promoted through the \"correctional\" \n\"phase\" component.  The \"confessions\" are made without consultation with counselor the \nchild's parents.  These  confessions  are  involuntary  as  they  are  coerced with the  threat of \ncontinued incarceration, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United \nStates Constitution and Article 1, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution. \n127.  These \"confessions\" are frequently untrue, and can be used against children or their \nparents in future legal proceedings. \n128.  Joseph brings  these  claims  on  behalf of the  class  members  against  Defendant \nOwens in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief only. \n129.  Joseph  also  brings  these  claims  in  his  individual  capacity  against  Defendants \nWilson and Penuelas.  Wilson and Penuelas forced Joseph to admit to elements of his offense \nthat were not found by the trial court, and were untrue. \nIV. FAILURE TO PROTECT \n130.  TYC  and  Defendant  Owens  do  not  employ  a classification  system  to  protect \nchildren in their custody from harm.  Children are not separated according to age,  stature, \noffense, or propensity for violence.  Young, small, vulnerable children are routinely housed with \nolder, larger, more dangerous children.  TYC and Defendant Owens have created an atmosphere \n-26-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 27 of 34\nwhere children are routinely assaulted by staff and other students, causing physical injuries to the \nstudents.  These conditions violate children's Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the \nUnited States Constitution to be protected from harm, as well as the children's rights under \nArticle 1, Section 13 of the Texas Constitution.  TYC and Owens are deliberately indifferent to \nthese conditions. \n131.  Defendant Owens admits in \"TYC's Rehabilitation Plan,\" which he drafted, that \n''the problems at TYC are not isolated events, but are entrenched in every vessel that channels to \nthe core of the agency's very existence.\"  Owens describes TYC as \"in a crisis state\" and \nconcedes ''the safety and well-being of the children who are in our custody are at stake.\" \n132.  Defendant Caldwell is the superintendent of the Evins State School, where the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice recently found students' constitutional right under the Eighth Amendment \nto be protected from harm was routinely violated during the period Joseph was incarcerated \nthere.  Defendant Caldwell is deliberately indifferent to these conditions. \n133.  Students  at  Evins  and  other  TYC  facilities  frequently  suffer  physical  injuries \nbecause of these conditions. \n134.  Joseph brings these failure to protect claims against TYC and Owens on behalf of \nclass members who would benefit from TYC employing a classification system for injunctive \nand declaratory relief. \n135.  Joseph brings these  failure  to  protect claims in his  individual  capacity against \nDefendant Henry, Defendant Mr. Trevino, and Defendant Torres.  Mr. Henry was deliberately \nindifferent to the obvious risks associated with placing Joseph in the same cell as an inmate \nclamoring to rape Joseph.  Trevmo and Torres knew other inmates were threatening Joseph, but \nfailed to place him in protective custody and failed to protect him from harm.  Trevino and \n-27-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 28 of 34\nTorres were deliberately indifferent to Joseph's rights. \nV. CONSPIRACY TO VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS \n136.  Defendants Dwight Harris, Freeman, Nicholson, Parsee, Caldwell, Bernard, Clay, \nDavidson, Brantley, and Reyes (hereinafter ''the conspirators\") conspired to  impede, hinder, \nobstruct and defeat Joseph and the class members from seeking the due course of justice.  The \nconspirators intimidated children and their parents to prevent them from reporting the civil rights \nabuses  taking  place  inside  TYC  facilities,  and  impeded  state  and  federal  law enforcement \ninvestigations into conditions inside TYC facilities.  This claim is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1985(2). \n137. Defendant Owens admits children in TYC custody ''may fall victim to retaliation or \nunwarranted extended placements.\" \n138.  The conspirators instructed their subordinates to carry out the conspiracy in order to \ndeprive Joseph and the class members of their rights under the law and to impede, hinder, \ninstruct and defeat Joseph and the class members from seeking the due course ofj ustice. \nVI. AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND CHAPTER 121 \n139.  Defendant TYC failed to provide Joseph with reasonable accommodations for his \nmental disabilities.  Though TYC was aware of Joseph's disabilities, TYC intentionally and \npurposefully denied him reasonable accommodations. \n140.  TYC's denial of reasonable accommodations resulted in: \na.  Lengthening  Joseph's  incarceration  in  TYC's  custody  because  due  to  his \ndisability he was unable to complete TYC's \"Resocialization©\" plan timely; \nb.  Joseph being raped by another inmate because he was placed in a single cell \nwith the other inmate due to his disability; \nc.  Joseph being sexually assaulted by TYC's staff because of the vulnerabilities \ncreated because of his disability; and, \n-28-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 29 of 34\nd.  Excessive force being used against Joseph by TYC staff due to behavior caused \nby his disability. \n141.  Defendant Owens admits \"numerous assessments\" of TYC' s training for new staff \nhave shown the training provided is \"inadequate.\"  TYC  does not provide reasonable staff \ntraining on accommodating children with disabilities. \nI \n142. TYC  receives  federal  funding,  and therefore  is  required to  provide reasonable \naccommodations under Section 504. \n143.  TYC is a public entity and therefore required to comply with Title II of the ADA. \n144.  Joseph brings these claims only in his individual capacity. \nVII. SEXUAL ASSAULT \n145.  Defendant  Delgado  intentionally  and  deliberately  engaged  in  a deliberate  and \noutrageous invasion of Joseph's bodily integrity that shocks the conscience in violation of his \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n141.  Delgado  misused  and  abused  official  power  granted  to  her  by  the  state  In \nperformance of her official duties thereby causing harm to Joseph. \n142.  Delgado engaged in this conduct with deliberate indifference to the constitutional \nrights of Joseph, and in violation of the criminal laws of the State of Texas. \n143.  Joseph brings these claims only in his individual capacity, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nVIII. EXCESSIVE FORCE \n144.  Defendants Shacklefield, Williams, McQueen, Briggs and Watson used excessive \nforce  causing  bodily  injury  to  Joseph,  in  violation  of Joseph's  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment rights.  Shacklefield,  Williams,  McQueen Briggs and  Watson deliberately and \nindifferently used excessive force against Joseph during his incarceration in a TYC facility. \n145.  Joseph brings these claims only in his individual capacity, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n-29-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 30 of 34\nIX. FAILURE TO PROVIDE MEDICAL ATTENTION \n146.  Defendants Rangel, Gagne, McDaniels, and Kitchens were deliberately indifferent \nto Joseph's serious medical needs.  They violated his right to medical care. \n147.  Rangel  refused  to  escort  Joseph  to  the  infirmary  when  he  discovered  Joseph \nbleeding from his arms after he attempted suicide.  Rangel told Joseph his condition was \"not \nserious,\" even though Joseph suffered permanent physical scars from the incident. \n148.  Defendant Dwayne Harris refused to escort Joseph to the inftrmary when he was \ndiscovered unconscious after attempting to commit suicide.  Harris told nurses attempting to aid \nJoseph not to provide him with medical attention because Joseph was \"faking.\" \n149.  Defendant McDaniels refused to provide Joseph treatment while he was vomiting \ndue to the nausea created by medication for the pain in his jaw.  McDaniels was deliberately \nindifferent to Joseph's Eighth Amendment right to receive medical care for serious medical \nproblems, telling him to vomit into his mouth and let the vomit run through the wires holding his \njaw shut, even though this put Joseph at serious risk of suffocating on his own vomit. \n150.  Defendants  McDaniels,  Kitchens  and  Gagne  refused  to  provide  Joseph  with \nprescribed painkillers.  Kitchens and Gagne were deliberately indifferent to Joseph's serious \nmedical need, causing him severe physical pain and injury. \n151.  Joseph brings these claims in his individual capacity only, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nX. FREE SPEECH AND EXRPRESSION - RETALIATION \n152.  Defendants Dwight Harris, Freeman, Nicholson, Parsee, Caldwell, Bernard, Clay, \nDavidson, Brantley,  and  Reyes  retaliated against Joseph by transferring him between TYC \nfacilities because of complaints he and his family raised about conditions in TYC facilities, in \nviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article \n-30-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 31 of 34\n1, Section 8 of the Texas Constitution.  These transfers placed Joseph farther away from his \nfamily, decreasing their ability to visit him.  The transfers also prolonged Joseph's incarceration \ndue  to  TYC's  refusal  to  transfer his  records.  The  purpose  of these  transfers  was  solely \nretaliatory,  and  done  with  deliberate  indifference  to  Joseph's  rights  to  free  speech  and \nexpression. \nXI.  ASSAULT AND BATTERY \n153.  Defendants  Delgado,  Williams,  Shacklefield,  Briggs,  and  Watson  intentionally \ncaused hannful contacts with Joseph.  Delgado intentionally forced Joseph to perform sexual acts \nwith her.  Defendants Williams and Shacklefield intentionally struck Joseph in the face with their \nriot shield, breaking his nose.  Defendants Briggs and Watson intentionally shackled Joseph so \ntightly that the leg irons cut into his ankles and caused him to bleed. \n154.  Defendants Delgago, Williams, Shacklefield, Briggs, and Watson caused Joseph \nimminent apprehension by intending to cause him a hannful contact. \n155.  Joseph brings these  claims  only in his  individual capacity,  and not  as  a class \nrepresentative. \nCAUSES OF ACTION - SUMMARY \n156.  Joseph  brings  the  following  claims  both  in his  individual  capacity and  as  the \nrepresentative of the class members: \na.  Due process, against Defendants TYC and Owens; \nb.  Access to Courts, against Defendants TYC and Owens; \nc.  Self Incrimination, against Defendants TYC and Owens; \nd.  Failure to Protect, against Defendants TYC, Owens and Caldwell; and, \ne.  Conspiracy  to  Violate  Civil  Rights,  against  Dwight  Harris,  Freeman, \nNicholson, Parsee, Caldwell, Bernard, Clay, Davidson, Brantley, and Reyes. \n-31-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 32 of 34\n158.  Joseph brings the following claims in his individual capacity only: \na.  Due process, against Defendants Penuelas and Wilson; \nb.  Access to Courts, against Defendant Wilson; \nc.  Self Incrimination, against Defendants Penuelas and Wilson; \nd.  Failure to Protect, against Defendants Henry, Trevino and Torres; \ne.  ADA and Section 504, against Defendant TYC; \nf.  Sexual Assault, against Defendant Delgado; \ng.  Excessive  Force,  against  Defendants  Shacklefield,  Williams,  McQueen, \nBriggs and Watson; \nh.  Failure to Provide Medical Attention, against Defendants Rangel, Dwayne \nHarris, Gagne, McDaniels and Kitchens; \nFree  Speech and Expression Retaliation,  against Dwight Harris,  Freeman, \n1. \nNicholson, Parsee, Caldwell, Bernard, Clay, Davidson, Brantley, and Reyes; \nand, \nj.  Assault  and  Battery,  against  Defendants  Delgado,  Williams,  Shacklefield, \nBriggs and Watson. \nDECLARATORY RELIEF \n159.  Joseph and the class members seek declaratory relief that Defendants conspired to, \nand did, and continue to, violate their rights under the Constitution of the United States, as \ndescribed above and summarized in the penultimate paragraph. \n160.  Joseph also seeks declaratory relief that Defendants did violate his own, individual \nstatutory rights under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, as well as under the Constitution of the \nUnited States, as described above and summarized in the penultimate paragraph. \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n161.  Joseph and the class members seek injunctive relief to  correct the  deficiencies \nregarding due process, access to Courts, self-incrimination, and failure to protect, as outlined \n-32-\n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY     Document 4      Filed 04/13/2007     Page 33 of 34\nabove.  These deficiencies are quantifiable, and thus damages are not an appropriate remedy. \nHowever, the deficiencies cause real and lasting injury to the class members. \nATTORNEYS' FEES \n162.  Joseph is entitled to recover attorneys' fees and costs to enforce his constitutional \nand statutory rights, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 42 U.S.C. § 12205. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE, Joseph respectfully requests that the Court: \nA.

Plaintiffs Joseph Galloway, A.B. (through his next friend, Dana Brockway), lW. \n(through his next friend, Gloria Washington), and lA. (through his next friend, Linda Thomas), \ncomplain that the Texas Youth Commission (\"TYC\") and its current and former staff routinely \nand daily violate the federal statutory and constitutional rights of children incarcerated in TYC \nfacilities,  and,  in  short, relegate their youthful lives to  a living hell.  TYC's own former \nconservator, Jay Kimbrough, describing TYC's \"systemic problems,\" stated it is \"a juvenile \njustice system in disarray.\" \n2.  Defendants routinely denied Joseph, A.B., J.W., J.A.,  and other children with \nqualified disabilities the reasonable accommodations to which they are entitled under Title II of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, 42  U.S.C.  § 12131  (\"ADA\"), and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U. S.C. § 794, resulting in physical injuries, denial of access to \nprograms and services, and continued incarceration in extremely restrictive settings. \n3.  TYC  employees  and Board members, through custom, policy,  and individual \naction, routinely physically and sexually assaulted, and/or allowed other inmates and TYC staff \nto assault, Joseph, A.B., J.W., J.A. and other children, denied them due process of law under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, denied their right to access to counsel \nunder the First, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, subjected \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 3 of 38\nthem to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution, compelled them to bear witness against themselves in violation of \nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and retaliated against \nthem  for  speaking  about the  problems  in  TYC  in  violation  of the  First and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  These claims are brought through 42 U.S.C. § \n1983. \n4.  Defendants  Harris,  Freeman,  Nicholson,  Parsee,  Caldwell,  Bernard,  Clay, \nDavidson, Brantley, Reyes, Munoz, Bethel, Fryar, Guest, Mahomes, Dickson, Robinson, Walters \nand Martinez had knowledge of the deplorable, unconstitutional conditions in TYC's facilities \nand failed to correct them.  As a result of these Defendants' inaction and dereliction of their legal \nduties, Plaintiffs suffered serious physical injuries and other violations of their constitutional and \nstatutory rights. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331,2201. \n6.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(a)(l) and (2) because TYC's \ncentral office and operational, decision-making center is located in this judicial district, because \nsome of the Defendants reside in this district, and because incidents at bar took place within this \njudicial district.  Plaintiffs further invoke the supplemental jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to \n28 U.S.c. § 1367(a) to consider their state law claims. \nPARTIES \n7.

A.B.,  J.W.,  J.A.  and the similarly-situated class members comprise a class of \napproximately 4,700 individuals who are currently, or will in the future be, in TYC custody. \n10 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 10 of 38\n56.  A.B., J.W., J.A., and the class members meet all the prerequisites for a class action \nas provided under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 for injunctive and declaratory relief. \n57.  The class which A.B., J.W., J.A., and the class members comprise is so numerous \nthat joinder of class members is impracticable. \n58.  Questions of law and fact are common to this class, namely: \na.  TYC fails to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with \ndisabilities to  enable these individuals to have meaningful access to  the \nprograms, services and activities ofTYC; \nb.  TYC fails to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with \ndisabilities to enable these individuals to be free from restraint and remain in \nthe least restrictive setting; \nc.  TYC fails to provide the care and treatment to qualified individuals with \ndisabilities requested by TYC's own treating professionals; \nd.  TYC  denies  individuals  due  process  of law  through  its  indeterminate \nsentencing scheme; \ne.  TYC denies individuals access to counsel through its policies, practices and \nprocedures; \nf.  TYC violates individual protections against self incrimination by requiring \nconfessions as part of their \"therapy;\" \ng.  TYC fails to provide treatment and rehabilitation services to individuals as \nrequired by the U.S. Constitution and Texas statutes; and, \nh.  TYC fails to protect individuals from harm, in violation of their Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendment rights. \n59.  A.B., J.W., lA., and the class members' claims as described herein are typical of \nthe claims of the class.  Together, A.B., J.W., lA., and the class members support their theories \nfor injunctive and declaratory relief on the same legal theories alleged in this case. \n60.  A.B., J.W., lA., and their counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe other class members.  Class counsel, Geoffrey N.  Courtney, has been class counsel in \nnumerous other class actions involving the rights of minors and persons with disabilities.  His \n11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 11 of 38\nrepresentation  has  been noted  with  approval by courts  in this  district.  See Neff v.  VIA \nMetropolitan Transit Authority and the City of San Antonio, 179 F.R.D. 185, 194 (W.D. Tex. \n1998).  Where an attorney has been found to be adequate in the past, it is persuasive evidence \nthat they will be adequate again.  Beckless v.  Heckler, 622 F. Supp. 715, 721 (N.D. Ill. 1985). \nMoreover, Plaintiffs' counsel believe that their resources are more than adequate to represent the \nclass competently and that they have no other professional commitments which are antagonistic \nto, or which would detract from, their efforts to secure a favorable decision for the class in this \ncase.  A.B., lW., lA., and their counsel will adequately assert and support the legal claims that \nform the basis of this action.  A.B., J.W., lA., and the children will benefit equally by virtue of \nthis action if the Court recognizes and vindicates their federal statutory and constitutional rights. \n61.  This class action may be properly maintained under the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) because Defendants' conduct pursuant to their procedures, policies, and/or \npractices denied A.B., J.W., J.A., and the class members their constitutional rights and final \ndeclaratory relief will settle the legality of the Defendants' challenged procedures, policies, and \nactions for the class as a whole. \n62.  Joseph brings his own claim for damages as an individual for the physical and \nsexual abuse he individually suffered while in TYC custody, separate from A.B., J.W. and lA.'s \nclaims on behalf of the class for injunctive and declaratory relief.  A.B., lW. and J.A. seek no \ndamages for the class, but do seek damages incidental to class relief. \nFACTS \nA.  TYC Operations \n63.  When children enter TYC, beginning in the fall of 2007, they will be initially \nprocessed through the McLennan County State Juvenile Correctional Facility in Mart, TX \n(hereinafter \"Mart\").  Prior to the fall of 2007, children were initially processed through TYC's \n1? \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 12 of 38\nMarlin Orientation and Assessment Unit in Marlin, TX (hereinafter \"Marlin\").  Most children \nspend about two months being initially processed before they are sent to other facilities.  Joseph, \nA.B., lW. and lA. each spent between forty-five and sixty days at Marlin. \n64.  Children in TYC custody are subject to transfer between TYC units at any time. \nAfter arriving at TYC's Giddings State School (\"Giddings\"), A.B. was later transferred to Mart, \nthen briefly to the Gainesville State School, then back to Mart.  lW. was initially transferred to \nMart, and then spent several months in TYC's Corsicana Residential Treatment Center facility \n(\"Corsicana\"), and was recently told he would be transferred to  TYC's Al  Price Juvenile \nCorrectional facility in Beaumont, TX.  lA. was initially placed at Giddings, then transferred to \nCorsicana, then to Crockett.  Following Marlin, Joseph was placed at Giddings, then moved to \nthe Evins State School (\"Evins\"), then was finally released from Crockett. \n65.  During their time at Mart (and previously at Marlin), children are supposed to be \ntested and evaluated to determine how they will be rehabilitated.  Children are provided with an \n\"individualized case plan,\" or ICP. \n66.  TYC assembles children's ICPs without input from them or their parents.  In order \nto formulate their ICPs, TYC limits all its testing and assessment to children's responses to a \ncomputer program.  Plaintiffs never spoke with a TYC counselor or caseworker about the ICP, \nand TYC only tested them to see if they had a learning disability or were mentally retarded.  The \nICP does not make accommodations for mental disabilities, or even consider such known \ndisabilities  as  Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\").  In  fact,  former  TYC \nConservator Kimbrough writes \"all but two [TYC] facilities lack academic counselors to develop \nappropriate schedules for students.\" \n67.  Most children in TYC are incarcerated for an indeterminate sentence.  A child has a \nminimum sentence set by the family court that committed them to TYC custody.  The child \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 13 of 38\nserves that minimum, plus only the additional time until they are rehabilitated and released to a \nless restrictive setting, such as a halfway house or their parents' home.  When children are \nreleased to this setting, they have certain conditions they must abide by, or they can be returned \nto TYC custody. \n68.  To be released to this less restrictive setting, a child has to complete their \"phases\" \nin TYC's \"Resocialization©\" program.  There are five phases (0-4), and each phase has three \ncomponents (Academic, Behavior, and Correctional, or A, B, C).  See 37 Tex. Admin. Code § \n87.3.  A child can complete one of their phases, and not advance in the others.  A child could \nsucceed academically but remain in TYC, for example, if TYC officials arbitrarily determine the \nchild has a \"behavior problem.\" \n69.  The \"Resocialization©\" program is a total failure.  TYC Conservator Kimbrough \nnotes it has a \"50 percent recidivism rate.\"  Though TYC has promised for months it will \nabandon \"Resocialization©\", it has yet to do so. \n70.  As part of the \"Resocialization©\" program, children are required to \"check and \nconfront\" their peers.  \"Checking and confronting\" requires children to correct other children's \nmisbehavior-essentially delegating TYC's security responsibilities to the children.  As part of \n\"checking and confronting,\" children are required to break up fights and police the actions of \nother children.  Part of this process involves calling \"huddle ups,\" where children assemble their \npeer group and confront misbehaving children.  \"Checking and confronting\" and \"huddle ].IpS\" \ncreate a dangerous atmosphere, because children are expected to \"snitch\" on their peers.  Refusal \nto  \"check  and  confront\"  other  children  prevents  children  from  advancing  in  the \n\"Resocialization©\" program and can delay their release from TYC custody. \n71.  A disciplinary action against a youth is a \"225,\" named for the number of the form \ncompleted.  A 225 can be either a \"category 1\" or \"category 2.\"  Category 1 is \"major,\" and \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 14 of 38\nwould include assaulting a fellow student or a guard.  A \"category 2\" is \"minor,\" and would \ninclude using foul language or violating Tye's dress code. \nn. \nTye intentionally discriminates against children with disabilities, including but not \nlimited to Plaintiffs, by assigning them 225s for manifestations of their disabilities. \n73.  Children are frequently given 225s without any notice or opportunity to respond. \nChildren, including Plaintiffs, may not even know Tye gave them a 225 until weeks later. \n74.  Former Tye Conservator Kimbrough noted \"correctional officers used disciplinary \nreports [225s] against [children] as a way to retaliate against youths who attempted to report \nproblems.  The disciplinary reports can and do cause [a child's] confinement to be extended. \nThat makes them a powerful tool for correctional officers and one that can be subject to abuse.\" \n75.  To complete the \"Behavioral\" or \"B\" phase, children must pass through four levels. \nTo achieve the \"B-1\" phase, a child cannot have more than seven \"category 2\"s and no \"category \n1\" s in a month.  To achieve the \"B-2\" phase, a child cannot have more than five \"category 2\"s in \na month and no \"category 1\" s.  To achieve the \"B-3\" phase, a child cannot have more than three \n\"category 2\"s, and no more than one \"category 2\"s to achieve the \"B-4\" phase.  The \"B\" phase is \nreviewed  every 30 days,  and  each  month's  number  of 225s  automatically  determines \n\"graduation\" to the next phase.  A child can only be promoted through one \"phase\" each month, \nso it will take a child a minimum of four months to be promoted through the \"B\" component. \n76.  To complete the \"Correctional Therapy\", or \"e\" phase, a child must identify the \n\"errors in [their] thinking\".  Completion of the \"C\" phase does not constitute actual mental health \ntherapy because TYC \"therapists\" only require students to memorize and recite a \"script\".  TYC \n\"therapists\" are not credentialed to provide mental health therapy or trained to  recognize \nchildren's mental disabilities.  Though TYe's statutory purpose is to rehabilitate students, TYC \nroutinely denies children the opportunities to participate in its \"rehabilitative\" programs. \n1 \" \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 15 of 38\n77.  \"C-l\" requires memorizing \"nine thinking errors.\"  \"C-2\" requires a child to write \nand memorize their \"life story.\"  \"C-3\" requires a child to talk about their \"offense.\"  This \ninvolves other children ridiculing the student during group therapy.  The \"therapist\" reads the \ngroup the police investigation statements and victim impact statements from the student's \noffense, although these documents are confidential under Texas Government Code § 508.313. \nThe other members of the group then \"make fun\" of the student, and a child advances to the next \nphase only when they show sufficient \"empathy,\" as arbitrarily determined by TYe.  \"C-4\" \nrequires developing a \"success plan,\" which outlines what the child will do when they leave \nTYC custody.  Lengthy delays in completing \"success plans\" result in extended incarceration for \nthese children, through no fault of their own.  Despite requiring children to formulate \"success \nplans\" before they can leave TYC custody, TYC provides children with no support once they \nleave. \n78.  TYC requires children to \"confess\" to elements of their offenses that were not the \nsubject of findings  by  the  family  court as  part of the  \"c\" phase.  In  some  cases,  these \n\"confessions\" are later used against the child or the child's parents in Child Protective Services \ninvestigations or future criminal proceedings.  In other cases, TYC's demands that children \nconfess to something that is not true substantially extends their incarceration.  Though the \nchildren are in TYC's custody, TYC does not advise the children that statements they make to \n\"therapists\" could be used against them in future legal proceedings.  If a child's confession does \nnot satisfy TYC, the sentence will be extended because the child cannot complete the \"C\" phase \nwithout making a full \"confession.\"  A child will only be released when ryC is satisfied the \nchild has fully \"confessed,\" even if this means admitting things that are not true, were not found \nby the family court that sentenced the child, and could subject the child or parents to future legal \nconsequences.  Children are not given a Miranda warning or the opportunity to consult with \n1\" \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 16 of 38\ncounsel  before  these  \"confessions.\"  A.B.  and  Joseph  were  threatened  with  continued \nincarceration if they did not confess to things they did not do.  Thus, Joseph confessed to things \nthat were not true, although these confessions prejudiced his legal rights.  A.B. continues to \nrefuse to confess to things that are not true, and his sentence has been extended as a result. \n79.  TYC forces students to confess to violations ofTYC rules during their \"correctional \ntherapy\" as well.  Although these children are in TYC's custody, they are not provided with a \nMiranda warning or the opportunity to consult with counsel before making these \"confessions.\" \nThese confessions are used to assign disciplinary 225s to students, which result in extended \nsentences. \n80.  TYC has taken Joseph, A.B., J.W., lA., and other children's \"phases\" away without \ndue process.  Demoting them was arbitrary and capricious.  Joseph once went from B-4 to B-1 \nwithout due process, even though it originally had taken him fourteen months to achieve B-1. \nA.B. was demoted from B-4 to B-3 despite his counsel requesting a hearing before A.B. was \ndemoted.  When a \"phase\" is taken away, there is usually no due process hearing where the child \ncan be represented by counsel, present evidence, cross examine witnesses, and present arguments \nto a neutral decision maker.  Joseph, A.B., J.W. and J.A. were never provided with counsel for a \nhearing, and their parents were never informed of the hearings. \n81.  TYC only provides a due process hearing when a student is given a \"category 1\" \n225,  even though  accumulated \"category 2\" 225s  are frequently used to  extend a child's \nsentence.  When a \"level 2\" hearing is held fora \"category 1\" 225, the decision-makers are the \nsuperintendent, program associates, and caseworker at the facility.  These individuals are not \nimpartial, and frequently are the same TYC officials whose allegations form the basis of the \ndisciplinary action. Likewise, they are the same officials who knowingly permitted children in \nTYC to be endangered through inadequate staffing, permitting and even hiding allegations of \n17 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 17 of 38\nsexual assaults, inadequate supervision and condoning violence and abuse of the children to \nwhom they were entrusted.  When hearings are held, TYC  staff frequently refuse to allow \nwitnesses to be called who would support a child's position, and do not allow children to cross \nexamine their accusers.  Children sentenced to placement in TYC, including Joseph, A.B., lW., \nand J.A., are not provided a meaningful opportunity to be heard when they are assigned 225s. \nAccumulation of 225s results in automatic extensions of children's sentences without due \nprocess. \n82.  TYC does not arrange for juveniles to have access to counsel to assist them when \nthey are given a 225, and does not even inform the children's parents they have been given a \n225.  Children in TYC custody frequently do not understand the disciplinary processes TYC \nutilizes to  extend their sentences.  Most children sentenced to TYC custody are indigent, \nincluding lA. and J.W., and cannot afford private counsel. \n83.  No objective guidelines or criteria exist governing when a child will be given a 225. \nChildren are frequently given 225s for arbitrary and capricious reasons, similar to instances when \nJoseph, A.B., J.W., and lA. were assigned the 225s discussed below. \n84.  Children in TYC rarely get in trouble for fighting.  Joseph recalls the kitchen at \nGiddings was \"like a boxing ring.\"  Joseph estimates he was in 60 fights during his time in \nTYC's custody, and was frequently physically injured.  A.B., J.W. and J.A. have all been injured \non multiple occasions when other students assaulted them.  Students are frequently physically \ninjured because of fights in TYC facilities. \n85.  TYC  does not employ a custodial classification system to  separate children \naccording to offense, propensity for violence or known danger and/or to protect the children in \nthis case.  In fact, TYC houses physically small and vulnerable children as young as ten years old \nin the same \"dorms\" as much older, larger children, some of whom are eighteen years old.  Many \nlR \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 18 of 38\nchildren in TYC custody sleep in \"open bay\" style donns, where as many as 25 students sleep in \na single room with little or no adult supervision.  Tye houses children accused of non-violent \noffenses, like graffiti or theft, with others who have been involved in murder or violent crime. \nThe Executive, Board and  Superintendent Defendants each knew  TYC  did  not employ a \ncustodial classification system, such as the systems that are employed in virtually every adult \ncorrectional facility, knew TYC housed children in \"open bay\" donns, knew this made the \nfacilities dangerous, and knew children were left unprotected. \n86.  TYC does not employ sufficient security staff to ensure children are not assaulted by \nother inmates.  The Texas State Auditor's Office found officer to child ratios as high as 1 to 25. \nTye has extremely high staff turnover, and is forced to operate with few,  poorly trained, \ncorrectional staff.  The Executive, Board and Superintendent Defendants knew about these \nstaffing problems, knew that it was placing individuals at Tye facilities, including but not \nlimited to Plaintiffs, at great risk of abuse and/or assault, but took no action to remedy the \nconditions to protect the children in their custody. \n87.  The fact that TY C staff take workers compensation at much higher rates than other \nstate employees, including employees in the adult prison system, further evidences the dangerous \nconditions in TYC facilities.  The Executive, Board and Superintendent Defendants knew about \nthese conditions as well. \n88.  Joseph, A.B., lA., J.W., and similarly-situated children have gone to the infinnary \nmany times for black eyes or broken noses from these fights.  Joseph would tell the nurses he \n\"fell in the shower\" or \"ran into my bunk\" because he did not want to be a \"snitch.\"  When both \nsides of J.W.'s jaw were fractured, nurses in the TYC infirmary appear to have accepted the \nunlikely explanation that he \"fell off the bunk.\"  Upon infonnation and belief, nurses and Tye \nofficials are not trained to and routinely fail to question these stories typical of abuse victims, \nlQ \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 19 of 38\nand/or investigate or report them, even though nurses had a legal obligation to report the \nincidents under Texas Family Code § 261.101. \n89.  Tye staff also regularly verbally abuse children with disabilities.  A.B., lW., J.A., \nand Joseph were all called \"stupid\" and various obscenities because of their disabilities and \nsuffered harm. \n90.  The Executive, Board and Superintendent Defendants knew of these policies and \nconditions discussed in this complaint, but did nothing to remedy them.  They knew Tye was \nnot only operating its facilities dangerously below accepted professional standards - they were \ndeliberately indifferent to these conditions.  They knew these conditions violated the clearly \nestablished constitutional rights of Joseph, A.B., lW., J.A. and many other children yet chose \nnot to remedy them and leave Tye children, including but not limited to Plaintiffs, in danger. \nAmong other things, they knew but failed to act to remedy: \na.  The failures of Tye's \"Resocialization©\" program, which they knew resulted in \nchildren  being  denied  rehabilitation  and  being  incarcerated  in  extremely \nrestrictive settings for periods much longer than the sentencing juvenile courts \nintended; \nb.  The dangerous conditions in Tye's facilities, which resulted in physical injuries \nto Plaintiffs,  as well as dangers caused by, among other things,: \ni.  Tye's failure to hire appropriate levels of security staff; \nii.  Tye's failure to train and supervise the limited staff they chose to hire; \niii. TYe's use of facilities with \"open bay\" dorms; \niv.  TYe's condoning andlor permitting assaults; and \nv.  Tye's failure  to  utilize a custodial classification system to  separate \nvulnerable children from older, larger, more violent inmates. \n70 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 20 of 38\n91.  The Caseworker Defendants also knew of these policies but continued to enforce \nthem.  The Caseworker Defendants knew the \"Resocialization©\" program resulted in children \nbeing  incarcerated  for  additional  periods  of time  in  more  restrictive  settings,  but were \ndeliberately indifferent to these policies.  They knew they were delaying children's release to \nless restrictive settings and denying children rehabilitative treatment, in violation of appropriate \nprofessional standards, but were deliberately indifferent to the effects of these policies on \nPlaintiffs. \n92.  In addition, the Superintendent Defendants also were aware of these conditions and \npolicies  described herein but were  deliberately indifferent to  them.  The  Superintendent \nDefendants knew of the extremely high rates of violence in TYC facilities, generally and dangers \nat the facilities they supervised, but took no action to remedy these obvious problems.  They too \nknew of TYC's staffing, training and supervision problems, use of \"open bay\" dorms, failure to \nutilize a custodial classification system, and condoned dangerous behavior.  They also knew the \n\"Resocialization©\" program resulted in children being incarcerated for additional periods of time \nin more restrictive settings, but were deliberately indifferent to these policies.  And as a result, \nPlaintiffs were harmed. \nB.  Joseph Galloway \n93.  Joseph is twenty years old and was released from TYC custody in April 2007, after \nbeing incarcerated for four years.  When he was eight years old, he spent time in a state mental \nhospital, where he was treated for bipolar disorder.  Joseph is a thin teenager and also has \nTourette's Syndrome and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). \n94;  Tourette's Syndrome is characterized by a collection of symptoms, including \ninvoluntary movements and sounds and involuntary compUlsive rituals and behaviors.  People \nwith Tourette's Syndrome experience obsessions, compulsions, inattention, impulsivity and \n?1 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 21 of 38\nmood variability.  The disability can cause people to involuntarily move, make loud noises, \nblink,  nod,  shake,  and  curse,  and  may  manifest  itself more  acutely  during  adolescence. \nTourette's Syndrome is a mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life \nactivities. \n95.  Bipolar disorder  is  characterized by  extreme  mood  swings,  from  mania  to \ndepression.  Bipolar disorder can result in risky behavior,  including inappropriate sexual \nbehavior and even suicidal tendencies.  Symptoms of bipolar disorder can include excessive \ntalking,  unusual  energy,  reckless  pursuit  of gratification  (including  promiscuous  sex), \nhallucinations or delusions, depressed mood, low self-esteem, poor concentration, and suicidal \nthoughts and feelings.  Bipolar disorder is a mental impairment that substantially limits one or \nmore major life activities. \n96.  ADHD prevents sufferers from paying attention and causes difficulty focusing.  The \nmost common symptoms of ADHD are difficulty paying attention, acting impulsively, and \nhyperactivity.  ADHD is a mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life \nactivities. \n97.  Joseph has been taking some form of medication for his disabilities since he was \nfivc years old.  He currently takes Clonidine to control his Tourette's Syndrome.  Clonidine is a \npowerful drug that can cause drowsiness and dizziness. \n98.  Joseph was incarcerated in four different TYC facilities: Marlin, Giddings, Evins \nand Crockett.  He was most recently incarcerated in Crockett. \n99.  TYC officials gave Joseph disciplinary actions for: \na.  Falling asleep after taking his medication which makes him drowsy; \nb.  Playing with a banana; \nc.  Sitting in the wrong seat during church; \n?? \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 22 of 38\nd.  Wearing his socks pulled down; \ne.  Wearing pants that were too large, although TYC provided the pants to him; \nf.  Wearing an extra shirt when he was cold; \ng.  Wearing a long sleeve shirt when he was cold; \nh.  \"Acting out\" because of his disability; \nHaving cornflakes in his bowl of milk when he was on a \"soft food\" diet; \n1. \nj.  Looking out the window during class; \nk.  Shaking hands with another child; and, \n1.  Being \"playful and immature.\" \n100.  Due to the discrimination against Joseph because of his disability and violations of \nhis due process rights, Joseph should have been released years earlier.  Instead, TYC illegally \nheld him captive in its hellish system, thereby depriving him of his youth and subjecting him to \nabuse by its employees and detainees. \n101.  Beginning in March 2005, Joseph had completed the minimum length of sentence \nassigned by him by TYC.  In March 2005, Defendant Bennett extended Joseph's sentence \nbecause he had only reached phase A-4, B-4, C-2.  Bennett checked a box on his March ICP \nreport indicating \"the results of this Phase assessment have extended the earliest projected \nrelease date.\"  Joseph was not provided any due process before Bennett made this decision to \nextend his incarceration.  Joseph would spend more than two additional years in TYC custody as \nBennett and his subsequent caseworkers (including Defendants Penuelas and Wilson) extended \nhis incarceration. \n102.  Joseph completed his \"phases\" in 2006 but his caseworker, Defendant Penuelas, \nadmitted that he \"never put it in the computer system.\"  TYC does not have centralized record \nkeeping or data collection indicating what phases have been completed.  Kimbrough describes \n\n---------------------------------------------------. \nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 23 of 38\nTYC's \"20 different databases that collect information, but none [that] talk to each other ... , \nThere is no one central data warehouse or integrated system that allows the agency to get a \ncomplete picture of any given youth's record.\"  TYC only keeps centralized records of the \nnumber of 225s  a student has accumulated.  When children are transferred between TYC \nfacilities, their records do not always transfer with them.  TYC keeps the records in a physical \nfile that guards are required to move with the child during transport.  Records are frequently lost \nbecause of this system.  This basic record keeping failure requires children to complete their \n\"phases\"  multiple  times  and  delays  their  release  from  TYC.  The  Executive,  Board, \nSuperintendent and Caseworker Defendants were all aware of this and the effects it had on \nchildren like Joseph but failed to remedy the problems.  TYC should have released Joseph long \nago.  But even by its own discriminatory practices, the latest release date would have been \nOctober 26,2006.  TYC failed to release him until AprilS, 2007. \n103.  Transfer between facilities can dramatically extend a child's incarceration.  When \nJoseph arrived at Crockett, Wilson sent his parents a letter telling them that even though Joseph \nhad a \"tentative release date\" he could not be released until he \"demonstrate[ed] his knowledge \nand ability to follow the Resocialization Program\" even though she knew Joseph had already \ndone this at the previous facilities. \n104.  When  Joseph  arrived  at  Crockett,  he  told  Defendants Wilson,  Freeman  and \nNicholson he had completed his \"phases\" and should be released.  The finals steps of Joseph's \n\"reintegration\" had already been completed.  Wilson told Joseph he was making excuses for why \nhe had not been released, that he \"had no proof' and that it was his fault he was still in TYC. \nDefendants Penuelas, Wilson, Nicholson and Freeman knew Joseph should have been released \nsooner to a less restrictive setting because he had completed TYC's rehabilitation program, but \n?4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 24 of 38\nwere deliberately indifferent to his extended incarceration.  In fact, under the provisions of the \napplicable code, these Defendants had no discretion not to release him. \n105.  While Joseph was in TYC custody, the Caseworker Defendants also coerced him to \nconfess to crimes he did not admit.  The Caseworker Defendants told Joseph he needed to admit \nto committing sexual acts with his younger brother that did not take place.  Joseph refused to \nmake these admissions for six months.  Joseph could not progress through the \"C\" phase during \nthese six months.  Finally, Joseph confessed to showing his brother pornography, although this \nalso did not take place, in order to satisfy his caseworkers. \n106.  While he was at Marlin, Joseph was sent to security for \"disrespecting staff' in \nSpring 2003.  Disturbed by the combination of his incarceration, difficult past, disabilities, and \nchanged circumstances,. he was reduced to beating on the wall in his cell.  The security director \nat the facility taunted Joseph, cajoling him to \"keep standing up\" and \"keep beating on that.\" \n107.  Defendants Shackleford and Williams were called to take Joseph out of his cell. \nThey came in the cell and hit Joseph in the face with their riot shield, breaking his nose and \ncausing serious physical injury.  Defendants knocked Joseph unconscious.  He woke up in a pool \nof his own blood, with more blood running down his face and all over his shirt.  Defendants \ncarried him out of the cell in leather restraints to the infirmary. \n108.  In the infirmary, TYC nurses told Joseph his nose was broken, but only gave him \ntoilet paper to stop the bleeding.  When he was taken back to his cell, he saw in the mirror his \nnose was crooked and continuing to bleed.  The care Joseph purportedly received was so derelict \nthat Joseph had to pop his nock back into place himself. \n109.  Because of this incident, Joseph was placed on \"BMP,\" the \"Behavior Management \nProgram.\"  BMP is \"isolation\"-students are taken out of the \"dorm\" and placed in segregation \ncells.  According to TYC policies/practices students are only supposed to spend two weeks in \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 25 of 38\nBMP, however,  Joseph was in BMP for almost three weeks.  Children have to \"earn their way \nout\" of BMP, as arbitrarily determined by TYC.  Only a \"level 2\" hearing takes place before \nchildren are put in BMP.  TYC fails to provide parents notice of their children's hearings, and \nstudents are not provided counsel before entering BMP.  BMP is a highly restrictive setting and \nfails to provide rehabilitative treatment.  Shackleford told Joseph he was kept on BMP so long \nbecause \"paperwork was lost.\" \n110.  Joseph was transferred to Giddings after he left Marlin.  He spent approximately \nthree years and three months at Giddings, from mid-2003 until April 2006. \n111.  When Joseph was first at Giddings, he was living in Dorm 8.  Female staff worked \nin the dorm.  Joseph had a job as a \"kitchen boy,\" and would clean up the kitchen, buff the floors \nand launder clothes from the kitchen. \n112.  Joseph was putting clothes in the washer when Defendant Warmke approached \nhim.  She told him, \"It's my tum to touch you.\"  She grabbed his crotch and felt his penis.  She \nstarted  squeezing  his  penis  through  his  clothes.  Defendant  Warmke  deliberately  and \nintentionally performed oral sex on Joseph, even though he was underage and in custody. \nWarmke  intentionally  violated  Texas  Penal  Code  §§  21.11  (indecency  with  a child), \n22.011(a)(2)(C) (sexual assault with a child) and 39.04(a)(2) (improper sexual activity with a \nperson in custody). \n113.  Warmke told Joseph not to tell anyone about what happened.  Though she did not \nwork with Joseph following the incident, she did have sexual relations with other minors at \nGiddings. \n114.  Around December 2003, TYC caused another inmate to rape Joseph at Giddings. \nIn particular, James Henry, a correctional officer entrusted to supervise and protect children at \nTYC, escorted Joseph back to the single cells.  When Henry took Joseph to the cells, they were \n?fi \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 26 of 38\nall filled with other detainees.  Some inmates were yelling to Henry, \"Put him in with me!\" and \n\"I want a piece of ass!\"  Henry chose to put Joseph in a cell with a large, older inmate named \nSteven, in spite of the fact that Steven had yelled to Henry that he planned to rape Joseph. \n115.  Then, not only did Henry put Joseph in the cell, he made Joseph take offhis clothes \nfor a strip search in front of the threatening rapist.  He forced Joseph to strip and bend over in \nfull view of Steven, and then Henry deserted Joseph while he was putting his clothes back on in \nthe cell. \n116.  Steven told Joseph to take his clothes back off.  Joseph refused.  Steven punched \nJoseph twice in the head.  Joseph fell down.  Joseph tried to fight back, but Steven was much \nlarger and stronger.  Steven turned Joseph around and took off his pants.  Joseph told him, \"Stop, \ndon't do it.\"  Steven continued punching Joseph.  Joseph told him to stop, but Steven sodomized \nhim multiple times, causing Joseph serious physical injury. \n117.  Steven told Joseph, \"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.\"  Joseph was afraid to report \nwhat Steven did to him because he would be considered a \"snitch,\" and because Tye guards \nwould not protect him from further assault.  Joseph spent the next twenty-four hours terrified in \nthe same cell with his rapist. \n118.  Although Tye guards, including Henry, are supposed to check the cells every \nfifteen minutes, upon information and belief, many guards only perform checks every hour. \nWhile Joseph was being raped, no Tye guard was there to protect him, and Henry was in \nanother hall between two solid doors.  Despite knowing Steven planned to rape Joseph, Henry \nplaced Joseph in the cell and left the area.  Accordingly, Henry was deliberately indifferent to \nJoseph's right to be protected from rape.  The Executive, Board, and Superintendent Defendants \nknew Tye did not have sufficient staff to monitor the cells, knew the existing staff was poorly \n?7 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 27 of 38\ntrained  and  inadequately  supervised,  and  knew  that  these  deficiencies  would  lead  to \nconstitutional violations like those alleged herein. \n119.  The same night, a few hours later, Henry took Joseph out of the cell to shower.  He \nsaw Joseph's underwear was covered in blood, and sarcastically asked him, \"What's wrong with \nyour ass?\"  Henry did not report that Joseph may have been sexually assaulted to anyone, \nalthough Henry knew Joseph had been raped and exhibited obvious symptoms of being raped, \nand even though Henry had an obligation to report the sexual assault pursuant to Texas Family \nCode § 261.101.  After Joseph showered, Henry returned him to the cell with Steven for another \nfear-filled fifteen hours. \n120.  Steven took Joseph's food that night, so Joseph did not get to eat.  Larger, stronger \ninmates frequently steal food from smaller, weaker students.  TYC guards know this takes place, \nbut are deliberately indifferent to it. \n121.  A few weeks later, Joseph went to the infirmary after complaining of blood in his \nstool.  The nurses also failed to report Joseph may have been sexually assaulted, even though \nthey had cause to believe he was a victim of sexual assault and were required to report suspected \nchild abuse pursuant to Texas Family Code § 261.101.  No forensic rape examination was done, \nand Joseph was only given Metamucil for \"constipation.\" \n122.  Joseph continues to suffer a serious ongoing physical injury because of Henry's \ndeliberate indifference.  And a few weeks after Joseph was raped, Henry was presumably unable \nto live with his actions and committed suicide. \n123.  By February 2006, Joseph was so distraught that he attempted suicide twice at \nGiddings.  Depressed, dwelling on what had happened to him at the hands of Defendants, TYC \nofficials had caused Joseph to lose his phase and once again did not allow him to go home.  He \n?R \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 28 of 38\nhad to call his parents and tell them he would not be coming home again.  As a consequence, \nJoseph felt that he would never get out ofTYC. \n124.  During the first suicide attempt, Joseph cut his wrists several times, causing a \nphysical injury.  A guard, Mr. Rangel, found him.  Rangel refused to take him to the infirmary. \nRangel told Joseph the wounds were \"not bad.\"  That night, when the pill call nurse came by, \nJoseph showed her the wounds were \"green,\" and he was belatedly taken to the infirmary. \nJoseph still has scars on his wrists from this suicide attempt.  Of equal significance, neither \nRangel, his supervisors or the nursing staff placed Joseph on suicide watch or sent him for \nspecific counseling related to the attempt. \n125.  During the second attempt, Joseph tried to hang himself.  He had taken threads \nfrom his mattress and braided them together into a two-foot rope.  He tied the rope around his \nneck, and passed out, causing physical injury.  Dwain Harris, the security director at Giddings, \nresponded to the cell.  Rather than helping him, Dwain Harris told the guards and nurses Joseph \nwas \"faking\" and \"there's nothing wrong.\"  While he was taken to the infirmary, Joseph's \nsuicidal tendencies remained unaddressed. \n126.  At Giddings,  it was  also well known (by the  Superintendent and Executive \nDefendants) that TYC officials routinely and regularly encouraged children to participate in an \nevent dubbed \"Gladiator Night.\"  Likewise, similarly dangerous and improper fights routinely \nwent on at Mart.  TYC guards encourage children to tie a sock around their ankles, fight and \nphysically injure other children who try to take the sock off.  And TYC officials allowed inmates \nto assault and physically injure students who refuse to participate in Gladiator Night.  Allowing \nGladiator Night or similarly dangerous fighting events to take place is not only a gross departure \nfrom acceptable professional standards, it evidences deliberate indifference to children's rights to \nbe protected from harm and these Defendants failure to remedy and/or eliminate the event caused \n?C) \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 29 of 38\nchildren at Giddings and Mart to be needlessly harmed,  viewed as having no rights,  and \nunprotected. \n127.  In the spring of 2006, TYC transferred Joseph to Evins in Edinburg, Texas, a \nnotoriously dangerous facility hundreds of miles from Joseph's family.  TYC moved Joseph to \nEvins, far away from his family after Joseph's mother was complaining about the conditions in \nTYC facilities. \n128.  In late 2005,  Joseph's mother wrote a letter to  Texas  Governor Rick Perry \ncomplaining about the conditions in TYC facilities.  The letter was referred to Defendants Harris \nand Robinson, and Harris wrote a lengthy response to Joseph's mother saying \"Joseph could be \nconsidered for release by this coming spring.\"  Defendants Clay and Bernard were also aware of \nthese complaints and others made by Joseph's mother. \n129.  Despite the assurance from Harris, shortly after receiving the response, Joseph \nwas transferred to Evins where he remained until February 2007.  The Executives, Robinson, and \nCaldwell were aware of the complaints in this letter, and fearful of being further exposed, \napproved andlor authorized the transfer to a location far from Joseph's mother.  In fact, a guard \nat Giddings specifically told Joseph they were \"glad to get rid of him\" because he filed so many \ngrievances.  When Harris later saw Joseph at Evins, he sarcastically asked him \"what are you \nstill doing here?\" \n130.  Moreover, the Executive and Superintendent Defendants knew not only that Evins \nwould make  it more  difficult for  Joseph to  see  his  family,  they  knew,  as  did the  Board \ndefendants, that Evins would be  dangerous for Joseph.  In 2004, a major riot occurred at the \nfacility.  Officers from other facilities were called to Evins to help quell the rioting.  In early \nsummer 2006, Texas Governor Rick Perry (who appoints the Board), TYC, Harris, and Caldwell \nwere informed in writing that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating conditions at the \niO \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 30 of 38\nfacility.  Defendant Bernard was at the facility during the rioting, and also knew about the \ninvestigation as did Defendant Clay.  TYC investigators found many constitutional violations \noccurring at Evins after the riots, yet no Defendants acted to correct the problems.  As a result, \nTYC children remained in significant danger. \n131.  Because TYC retaliated against Joseph by sending him hundreds of miles away to \na dangerous facility, his family was not able to see him as frequently as when TYC housed \nJoseph at Giddings.  Moreover,  Joseph was placed in danger at Evins.  And with limited family \ninvolvement, which is critical for any rehabilitative program to be successful, Joseph's move to \nEvins, also lacked a legitimate penological purpose.  Rather, TYC, the Executives, Robinson, \nand Caldwell retaliated against Joseph because he and his family exercised their free speech and \nexpression rights by complaining about conditions in TYC. \n132.  Most of the students at Evins are members of racial minority groups.  Joseph is \nCaucasian.  However, Joseph was subsequently removed from protective custody. \n133.  Moreover, at Evins, TYC staff encouraged students to fight and told Joseph to \n\"prove you are not a bitch.\"  The United States Department of Justice issued a finding letter in \n2007 concluding, \"Conditions at Evins violate the constitutional rights of the youth residents .... \nChildren at Evins are not adequately protected from harm.\"  The Department of Justice wro,te: \n\"Our investigation revealed an unacceptably high rate of youth violence at Evins. \nThe atmosphere at Evins is chaotic and dangerous.  Youths frequently fight with \neach other without detection or intervention by staff.  Staff members and youths \nwe interviewed consistently reported that staff members are unable to manage \nyouths' behavior due to inadequate staffing.  According to information provided \nby TYC, there were 1,025 reported youth-on-youth assaults at Evins in 2005, an \naverage of 2.8 per day.  For the first six months of 2006, there were 568 reported \nyouth-on-youth assaults, an average of 3.1 per day.  This frequency of assaults is \na substantial  departure  from  generally  acceptable  professional  standards. \nNationally, facilities comparable to Evins typically report an average of .241 \nyouth on youth assaults per 100 days of confinement which, for Evins, correlates \nto 1.235 assaults per 100 days of confinement.  Thus, the average rate of assaults \nat Evins is approximately five times the national average.\" \n11 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 31 of 38\nDefendant Caldwell was the superintendent at Evins during Joseph's incarceration there, and was \naware of and deliberately indifferent to these conditions.  The Executive and Board Defendants \nwere aware of these conditions and also were deliberately indifferent to them. \n134.  In fact, the Department of Justice concluded following their investigation that \nthere was a pattern or practice of failing to ensure that the youth at Evins are adequately \nprotected from harm and that such children were at undue risk of harm from staff assault and \nyouth-on-youth assault.  Moreover, the Department of Justice further concluded that there was a \npattern or practice of failing to provide youth at Evins adequate due process and adequate \nrehabilitative treatment. \n135.  Nor did TYC contest these conclusions when the government sued TYC.  Rather, \nTYC agreed that policies needed to be instituted to correct these deficiencies, including but not \nlimited to establishing mandatory post coverage, mandatory staffing requirements, additional \ntraining and the implementation of a custodial classification system. \n136.  In  addition to  Evins, eleven other TYC facilities also had dangerously high \nnumbers of reported safety complaints - all of which was known by the Board and Executive \nDefendants, and never remedied. \n137.  While at Evins, TYC  staff searched the bunks of Joseph and another child. \nDefendant Trevino  found  a poem with  racially charged words  in  the  other child's bunk. \nShockingly, Trevino read the poem aloud to the minority students, intending to incite them to \nattack Joseph.  Then, Trevino threatened Joseph, telling him \"you're public enemy number one\" \nand \"this is campus wide.\"  Defendant Torres was also aware that Joseph and the other child \nwere in grave danger. \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 32 of 38\n138.  Despite the obvious danger facing Joseph and his friend, Defendants Trevii'io and \nTorres failed  to  place Joseph in protective custody.  Thus,  Defendants were  deliberately \nindifferent to Joseph's right to be protected from harm. \n139. As Defendants expected, and as the Department of Justice found to be all too \ncommon and TYC acknowledged, early the next morning, six unknown assailants attacked \nJoseph and the other child.  One of the assailants, an inmate who was much larger than Joseph, \nsmashed Joseph's head on the concrete and Joseph blacked out.  He woke up soon thereafter, and \nsaw the other student being assaulted.  When he tried to help him, Joseph was beaten.  He was \nkicked in the head and mouth, suffering serious physical injuries.  When the beating was over, a \nguard, Defendant Torres, told Joseph, \"That's what you get for writing racist shit.\"  Trevino and \nTorres encouraged the other students to assault Joseph, and were deliberately indifferent to \nJoseph's right to be protected from physical injury. \n140.  Joseph suffered a broken jaw, a concussion and bruised orbiter bone.  Despite the \nobvious injuries, TYC guards failed to immediately take Joseph or the other child, who also \nsuffered physical injuries, to the infirmary. \n141.  Joseph tried to eat breakfast after the attack, but could not do so because of terrible \npain in his jaw.  His friend had to call security for him, and forty-five minutes later the nurses \nresponded and took him to the infirmary.  Forty-five minutes after that, he was taken to the \nemergency room in an ambulance, where his jaw was wired shut. \n142.  Joseph's mother was terrified for her son and reported the incident to TYC officials \nand several law enforcement agencies. \n143.  A few days after this incident, Joseph. was transferred from Evins to Crockett, \nwhich is nearer his parent's home.  Defendant Caldwell asked his mother \"are you happy now?\" \nafter informing her Joseph was leaving his facility. \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 33 of 38\n144.  Because Joseph's jaw had been wired shut, wire cutters had been provided to the \nsecurity staff in Joseph's part of the Crockett facility.  As nausea is a common side effect of the \npain medication, Joseph and staff had been instructed that they may have to cut the wires if he \nneeded to vomit.  Unfortunately, Joseph became nauseous.  When Joseph told the guard he \nneeded to vomit and asked a guard to cut the wires, the guard called Defendant McDaniels in the \ninfirmary.  Defendant McDaniels refused the request and told the guard that when Joseph needed \nto vomit, Joseph did not need to have the wires cut.  McDaniels said that Joseph could just \"hang \nhis head upside down over the toilet, and let the vomit drip out. \" \n145.  Nauseous and terrified that he would suffocate on his own vomit, Joseph ripped the \nwires out himself.  All in all, Joseph pulled more than twenty wires out of his gums, and each \npull was excruciating.  TYC nurses also refused to give him his prescribed painkillers on the \nprescribed schedule even though they knew he needed them and he was in pain.  Rather than \ndiscipline the nursing staff, TYC  gave Joseph three disciplinary actions and extended his \n. incarceration without due process because of this incident. \n146.  When Joseph was transported to UTMB  in Galveston, Defendants Briggs and \nWatson tightly shackled his legs.  The shackles cut deeply into Joseph's legs, and his socks \nbecame very bloody.  Joseph told Briggs and Watson the shackles were hurting him and cutting \ninto his skin, and asked them to loosen the leg~irons.  Briggs and Watson refused, despite \nknowing Joseph was in pain.  Joseph still has scars on his ankles from these physical injuries. \n147.  Moreover, the abuse Joseph faced continued until his final days in Tye custody. \nDays before Joseph was released, Defendant McQueen, a correctional officer, struck Joseph in \nthe jaw for no reason.  Joseph had impulsively picked up a tray to eat out of tum and McQueen, \nwithout any justifications, struck Joseph in the face.  As a result, Joseph suffered further physical \ninjury to his jaw, and was taken to the hospital for testing.  Incredibly, but in keeping with \ni4 \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 34 of 38\nTYC's practice of no accountability, lack of supervision and outright condoning of abuse and \nassault  of the  children  entrusted to  its  care,  Joseph,  and  not  Defendant  McQueen,  was \ndisciplined. \n148.  After  the  assault,  Joseph  asked  to  speak with  his  mother  and  his  attorneys. \nDefendant Wilson told Joseph he would not be allowed to contact his mother or attorney.  In \nfact, Wilson threatened Joseph that he would not be released from Tye if he reported this \nincident. \n149.  When Joseph began to discuss what happened to him in Tye with his attorneys, \nDefendant Wilson refused to allow him to have a confidential attorney/client phone call with his \nlawyer.  Despite requests from  his counsel to Defendants Freeman and Wilson for Tye's \npolicies and procedures related to attorney/client visits and phone calls, these policies were not \nprovided.  The first time Joseph's attorney attempted to speak with him on the telephone, Wilson \nrefused to leave the room and would not allow Joseph to confer with his attorney in private. \n150.  Joseph's attorneys mailed him confidential legal documents.  Unknown Tye staff \nopened this mail outside Joseph's presence, and read the confidential and privileged documents \ninside.  The envelope containing the documents was clearly marked \"legal mail\" on the front and \nback, but Tye staff deliberately disregarded these labels.  Upon information and belief, the \nExecutive Defendants, and Defendants Freeman and Nicholson were aware of this practice. \n151.  When Joseph told Defendant Wilson he wanted to report this abuse to the Tye \nabuse hotline, she told him he could not call the hotline.  Again, Wilson told Joseph if he \nreported his abuse, Tye would extend his incarceration. \nC.  A.B .. \n152.  A.B. is sixteen years old and has been incarcerated in Tye facilities since he was \nfifteen.  A.B. has a six year determinate sentence, with a one year minimum sentence to Tye \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 35 of 38\ncustody.  He has served over one year in TYC custody.  He is now eligible to be released from \nTYC custody to a less restrictive setting.  If he were to violate the conditions of his parole, he \ncould return to TYC.  He is slight and thin, and has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). \n153.  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent, \nunwanted thoughts and/or repetitive behaviors.  People with OCD suffer persistent, unwanted \nthoughts or images, and need to repeat behaviors over and over.  OCD is a mental impairment \nthat substantially limits one or more major life activities. \n154.  A.B. has been incarcerated in four different TYC facilities: Marlin, Giddings, \nGainesville, and Mart. \n155.  TYC has given A.B. disciplinary actions for: \na.  Breaking up a confrontation between other students; \nb.  Uncontrollable laughing; \nc.  Having newspaper articles about abuses at TYC in his possession; \nd.  \"Failure to be observant\"; \ne.  \"Failure to correct peers\"; \nf.  \"Failure to call 'huddle-ups\"'; \ng.  Talking to his mother on the phone; \nh.  Not marching properly; \nRefusing to leave protective custody; and \n1. \nj.  Another child ripping out the tongues of his shoes. \n156.  Some of the above behaviors TYC has disciplined A.B. for are caused by his \ndisability.  For example, because of his OCD, he feels compelled to call his mother at the same \ntime every evening.  TYC has disciplined A.B. when he is unable to call his mother. \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 36 of 38\n157.  TY C staff intentionally discriminate against A.B. because of his disability, calling \nhim \"stupid\" and \"slow.\" \n158.  A.B. contends he was wrongfully convicted and did not commit the offense that \nresulted in his incarceration in TYC's facilities.  A.B.'s criminal case is currently on appeal \nbefore the Texas Fifth Court of Appeals.  Despite this, TYC will not allow him to progress \nthrough the \"c\" phase because he will not confess to a crime he did not commit and is therefore \n\"not accepting responsibility for his offense.\"  TYC staff tell A.B. he needs to \"give up the \nappeal,\" that he \"can't win\" the appeal and \"can't beat the courts.\"  Though A.B. has achieved \nPhases A-4 and B-4, he cannot progress any farther through the \"Resocialization©\" program \nbecause he, at the advise of counsel, refuses to confess to a crime he did not commit.  TYC staff \ncontinues to coerce A.B. to confess, even though they know he is represented by counsel.  If \nA.B. were to confess, it would prejudice his appeal. \n159.  Defendant Bush was A.B.'s caseworker during this period.  She administered the \nResocialization© program with him, and refused to allow him to progress through the program \nbecause he would not confess to the crime he did not commit.  Bush's actions extended A.B.'s \nincarceration because she refused to approve him for release to a less restrictive setting when he \nwould not give up his Fifth Amendment rights. \n160.  On November 1, 2007, TYC convened a panel of its staff, including Defendant \nBush, to consider releasing A.B. on parole.  On November 5, 2007, TYC and Defendant Bush \ntold A.B. he would be released to parole on November 14,2007.  TYC and Defendant Bush had \nA.B.  sign documents related to his sex offender registration, which indicated he would be \nreleased on November 14,2007.  While on parole, A.B. would be required to attend out-patient \nsex offender treatment therapy, see his parole officer regularly, obey various parole conditions, \nand register as a sex offender. \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 37 of 38\n161.  TYC, however, denied A.B. release to a less restrictive setting.  TYC and Bush \nwould not allow A.B. to participate further in its rehabilitation programs because he is asserting \nhis Fifth Amendment rights.  The fact that A.B. is unable to complete the \"C\" phase due to his \nappeal of his conviction is explicitly noted on Monthly Individual Case Plans completed by \nBush. \n162.  In failing to allow A.B. to progress in the \"Resocialization©\" program due to his \nrefusal to admit to a crime that he did not commit and in so doing prejudice his appeal, TYC has \nextended the length of A.B.'s confinement.  A.B. would otherwise have been eligible for parole \non November 6,2007. \n163.  A.B .. has been physically abused by other inmates on multiple occasions while in \nTYC custody, causing physical injuries. \n164.  A.B. \"checks and confronts\" children or refers them to \"huddle ups\" to attempt to \nadvance in TYC's \"Resocialization©\" program.  Children A.B. has \"checked and confronted\" or \nreferred to a \"huddle up\" later assault him because participation in \"checking and confronting\" \nand \"huddle ups\" transform A.B. into a \"snitch.\"  Children assaulting A.B. frequently tell him \n\"snitches get stitches.\"  As one would expect, A.B. is fearful of additional harm. A.B. now \nrefuses to \"check and confront\" other children, which could result in disciplinary action against \nhim and delay his release from TYC custody to a less restrictive setting. \n165.  On one occasion at Giddings, A.B.'s front teeth were chipped when other inmates, \nincluding S.L., savagely beat him in the head,  permanently damaging and  disfiguring his \nteeth/mouth.  S.L. had previously stolen A.B.'s pants, so A.B. called a \"huddle up\" to \"check and \nconfront\" S.L.  Defendant Lewis supervised the \"huddle up,\" and knew A.B. had \"confronted\" \nS.L. about S.L.'s misbehavior.  Afterwards, Lewis knew S.L. told A.B. \"snitches get stitches.\" \n\nCase 1:07-cv-00276-LY   Document 132   Filed 02/20/08   Page 38 of 38\n166.  Though Lewis knew S.L. considered A.B. a \"snitch,\" and knew about the specific \nthreat made against him, she did nothing to protect A.B. from S.L.  Soon after the \"huddle up,\" \nA.B. was sitting down, tying his shoes.  S.L. came up to A.B. and kicked him in the face, \nbreaking A.B.'s front teeth. \n167.  Other inmates frequently punch A.B.  at night when he is asleep, and on one \noccasion several inmates urinated on his bed.  Because of these almost daily assaults, A.B. has \nreferred himself to \"security,\" and refused to leave on multiple occasions.  Other students have \nalso refused to leave security because they fear for their safety.  In fact, A.B.'s plight is so well \nknown that Giddings' Tye staff refer to this phenomenon as \"pulling an [A.B.]\" \n168.  A.B. has been forced to participate in fights with other children in Tye, causing \nphysical injuries.  Because Tye staff does  not properly supervise the  children, employs \ninadequate staff, and does not employ a custodial classification system, A.B. is frequently forced \nto defend himself when he is alone with other children.  Tye is deliberately indifferent to these \nfights.  For example, one child punched A.B. in the groin, told him \"I'll beat your bitch ass,\" and \nboast he would rape A.B.'s mother.  Other children attack A.B. in the hallways and on the dorms \nto \"punk\" him.  This is the environment the Executive, Board, and Superintendent Defendants \ncreated, fostered, and condoned. \n169.  Defendant Eduardo Martinez was the Superintendent of Giddings State School \nduring this time.  He was aware that dangerous inmates were being housed with smaller children \nand was deliberately indifferent to these conditions.  Martinez knew A.B. and other children \nwere housed in dangerous \"open bay\" dorms.  Martinez knew there was inadequate security staff \nto protect inmates like A.B., and was specifically informed of dangers to A.B. by the principal of \nthe education programs at Giddings on the day of the assault described above yet took no steps to ",
