    "summary": "<p>On December 6, 2002, a prisoner in Florida's Okeechobee Correctional Institution (OCI), represented by counsel from the Florida Justice Institute, sued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging that his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment was being violated by the defendants' failure to provide him appropriate medical care. The lead defendant was Florida's contract medical service provider for OCI; also named as defendants were associated state and corporate individuals overseeing the contract medical provider's conduct. The plaintiff alleged that he had been treated elsewhere in the Florida prison system for his Hepatitis-C and cirrhosis but that when he was transferred to OCI, the medically-indicated treatments were halted solely for cost-saving reasons. Needing Interferon and Ribavirin treatments for his condition, he sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time he filed his complaint, the plaintiff also sought, via motion, a preliminary injunction to require the defendants arrange that a gastroenterologist consult with him and provide the requested FDA-approved treatment regimen. The defendants, in their opposition to the motion, argued that the matter arose from a difference of opinion between doctors about medical care and was not a matter of deliberate indifference to plaintiff's medical needs. The plaintiff contended in response that the medical opinions cited by the defense were unreliable and self-serving, compared to the plaintiff's medical experts' opinions.</p>\r\n<p>On January 7 and 9, 2003, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint. The motion for a preliminary injunction and motions to dismiss were referred to U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank J. Lynch, Jr. On March 4, 2003, Magistrate Judge Lynch issued two separate reports and recommendations. First, he recommended denying the motion to dismiss. One defendant, who was Secretary of the Department of Corrections, had argued that the claims against him should be dismissed because providing health care to inmates was outside of the scope of his duties, but Magistrate Judge Lynch rejected this argument. The defendants had also argued that the plaintiff failed to state a prima facie case that his Eighth Amendment rights had been violated, but Magistrate Judge Lynch disagreed, explaining that the allegation that the defendants did not provide the treatment recommended by most of the plaintiff's doctors was enough for a prima facie case. On April 28, 2003, District Judge James C. Paine adopted the report and recommendation and denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>Magistrate Judge Lynch also recommended that the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction be denied. However, on April 29, 2003, Judge Paine reversed the magistrate judge's recommendation and granted the motion. Judge Paine held that the plaintiff had sufficiently shown a substantial threat of irreparable injury and a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits of his Eighth Amendment claim. Therefore, he ordered the defendants to let the plaintiff see a gastroenterologist and to provide the treatment that the gastroenterologist recommended.</p>\r\n<p>On July 24, 2003, after an emergency motion by the plaintiff, Judge Paine entered an order making the preliminary injunction permanent, requiring the Interferon and Ribavirin treatments, and directing the parties to attempt to resolve the attorneys' fee issues within ninety days.</p>\r\n<p>On November 18, 2003, the plaintiff's counsel filed a notice with the court that a settlement had been reached with the defendant on the matter of attorney fee payment. Specifics were not provided. On January 12, 2004, Judge Paine directed the court clerk to close the case, but reserved jurisdiction to enforce the previously-entered injunction. As of June 2024, there were no further developments.</p>",

Each of the items upon \nwhich plaintiff relies is being filed simultaneously with this \nMotion. \nPlaintiff contends that absent injunctive relief he will \ncontinue to be denied a Gastroenterologist consult and will \ncontinue to be denied the medication necessary to combat Hepati-\n\ntis C, that he will suffer irreparable injury up to and including \nliver cancer and premature death, that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that he will ultimately prevail on the merits, that \nthere is a greater injustice to him if the injunction is denied \nthan harm to defendants if it is granted, and that granting the \nrequested relief will not disserve the public interest. \nA prompt hearing is requested to put an end to the defen-\ndants' unlawful conduct.  Filed with this Motion are a Request \nfor a Prompt Hearing and a proposed Writ of Habeas Corpus ad \nTestificandum requiring the Florida Department of Corrections to \nproduce the plaintiff at a prompt hearing to be scheduled by the \nCourt. \n  STATEMENT OF FACTS \nPlaintiff, Allen Brash, is a prisoner in the custody of the \nFlorida Department of Corrections, currently confined at \nOkeechobee Correctional Institution.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 6.  \nDefendant, Wexford Health Resources, Inc., (hereinafter Wexford) \nis a Florida corporation operating under color of state law under \ncontract with the Florida Department of Corrections to provide \nmedical and health care services to the inmates confined at \nOkeechobee Correctional Institution.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 7.  \nDefendant, David Rowe, is Vice President and Chief Medical \nDirector for defendant Wexford Health Sources, Inc.  Verified \nComplaint, ยถ 8.  As Chief Medical Director, defendant Rowe makes \npolicy under color of state law for defendant Wexford by deter-\nmining who is allowed to receive medical care recommended by \n \n  - 2 - \n\ndefendant Wexfordโs prison doctors.  Id.  Defendant Moore as \nSecretary of the Florida Department of Corrections is responsible \nfor the medical care of all inmates.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 9. \nMr. Brash came into the custody of the Florida Department of \nCorrections in 1987.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 10.  Mr. Brash has \nHepatitis C and is in the second stage of cirrhosis, a condition \nwhich can be caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV).  Dr. Cecilโs \nDeclaration, ยถ 3.  If Hepatitis C is left untreated, it may lead \nto cirrhosis of the liver, cancer of the liver, and death.  Id. \nUntil December 2001, Mr. Brash was housed at Union Correc-\ntional Institution under the care of Dr. Shah, a Gastroenterolo-\ngist at the North Florida Reception Center employed by the \nFlorida Department of Corrections.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 12.  \nDr. Shah treated the plaintiff with Interferon with Ribaviron.  \nId. \nA hepatitis patient is deemed cured when his viral load \nfalls to zero.  Although Mr. Brash responded favorably to treat-\nment, the treatment did not eliminate the virus completely, his \nviral counts fell to less than 600IU/ml.  Dr. Cecilโs Declara-\ntion, ยถ 4.  At the end of the 11 month treatment period, in \nAugust 2001, Dr. Shah charted that the plaintiff should be \nchecked after 6 months for a liver profile and presumably be \nrestarted on a treatment regimen for Hepatitis C.  Verified \nComplaint, ยถ 13 and Medical Records.  On October 10, 2001, Dr. \nShah charted that Mr. Brash should be scheduled to see a Gastro-\nenterologist by December 10, 2001.  Id.  Before Mr. Brash could \n \n  - 3 - \n\nsee a Gastroenterologist, Mr. Brash was transferred to Okeechobee \nCorrectional Institution.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 13. \nMr. Brash came under the care of defendant Wexford and its \nprison doctor, Dr. Bhadja, at Okeechobee Correctional Institu-\ntion.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 14.  Another Gastroenterologist \nConsult was recommended for the plaintiff on January 23, 2002, \nthis time by Dr. Bhadja.  Id.  The consult recommendation was \ndenied by defendant David Rowe in corporate headquarters in \nPittsburgh on January 28, 2002.  Dr. Cecilโs Declaration, ยถ 5.  \nOn January 30, 2002, Dr. Diaz, another Wexford prison doctor at \nOkeechobee Correctional Institution charted, โthis patient [Mr. \nBrash] is a treatment failure.  He should not be treated again.  \nFollow up yearly for Hep C.โ  Dr. Cecilโs Declaration, ยถ 5. \nMr. Brash has not seen a Gastroenterologist after his \nmedical care was assumed by defendants Wexford and Rowe from mid-\nDecember 2001 until the present despite the recommendations of \nthree doctors, two of whom are employed by defendant Wexford and \none by defendant Moore.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 15. \nMr. Brashโs condition is such that if he is not provided the \nFDA approved PEG Interferon with Ribavirin combination therapy, \nthere is a 50%-50% chance that he will not survive another 10 \nyears.  Dr. Cecilโs Declaration, ยถ 6. \nMr. Brash is a curable patient.  Dr. Cecilโs Declaration, ยถ \n7.  But since he has severe fibrosis, Mr. Brash needs treatment \nto prevent his premature death.  Id.  Cirrhosis, or a massive \nscarring of the liver, follows long-term infection from the \n \n  - 4 - \n\nvirus.  Id.  Cirrhosis leads to liver cancer or liver failure.   \nAbsent a transplant, death follows.  Id. \nLiver disease and especially end stage liver failure is a \nprolonged, and often gruesome, death.  Id.  As scar tissue \nreplaces healthy cells, liver function starts to fail and a \nperson may experience the following symptoms: exhaustion, fa-\ntigue, loss of appetite, nausea, weakness and weight loss.  Id.  \nThese are usually early signs of liver failure which can lead to \nthe complications of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.  Id. \nMr. Brashโs HCV virus will not be eradicated without treat-\nment.  Dr. Cecilโs Declaration, ยถ 9.  The acceptable treatment \nprotocol available involves the use of interferon.  Id.  The goal \nof HCV therapy is permanent eradication of the virus in the \nserum.  Id.  Sustained virologic responses, the usual standard of \nsuccessful therapy is defined as the absence of the HCV RNA in \nthe serum during therapy and six months after the completion of \ntherapy.  Id.  Sustained viral responders have a 97% chance of \ncure.  Id.  A patient who is cured will have a negative HCV-RNA \nfor the rest of his or her life.  Id.   \nIn August 2001 the FDA approved the combination of Peginter-\nferon and the nucleoside analogue Ribavirin for patients with \nchronic HCV infection.  Dr. Cecilโs Declaration, ยถ 10.  This \ncombination of Peginterferon plus Rebetol permits a sustained \nvirologic response to approximately 40% in genotype 1 with higher \nrates in genotypes 2 and 3.  Id.  Mr. Brash is genotype 1.  Id.  \nThe FDA approved Pegasys for treatment of HCV cirrhosis on \n \n  - 5 - \n\nOctober 16, 2002.  Id.  Mr. Brash should start on Pegasys immedi-\nately.  Id.  Ribavirin should be added in January when the FDA \napproves it.  Id.  He should be treated for 18-24 months to \nprevent relapse when the treatment is completed.  Id.   \nSince the approval of Pegylated interferon, its use has \nbecome the standard of care for treatment of HCV.  Dr. Cecilโs \nDeclaration, ยถ 11.  Pegylated Interferons are superior to ordi-\nnary Interferons.  Id. \nThe chance of successful treatment is greater than 40% for \nMr. Brash because he had a good response to interferon in the \npast.  Dr. Cecilโs Declaration, ยถ 12.  He has an excellent chance \nof responding to Pegylated interferon.  Id. \nUnless Mr. Brash receives immediate treatment with Pegylated \ninterferon and Ribaviron therapy, he will die a premature death \ndue to liver failure or liver cancer.  Dr. Cecilโs Declaration, ยถ \n13.  If he is successfully treated, he has a normal life expec-\ntancy.  Id. \nIn June 2002, Dr. Robert Smith, regional medical director \nfor defendant Wexford in Miami recommended that Mr. Brash be \nrestarted on PegIntron and Ribaviron therapy treatment.  Medical \nRecords.  Mr. Brash was told that he could expect treatment to \nbegin in 8 weeks.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 21.  In late June, Mr. \nBrash was informed that someone countered Dr. Smithโs recommenda-\ntion, and Mr. Brash would not be restarted on treatment as \npromised.  Id. \n \n  - 6 - \n\nDefendant David Rowe rejected Dr. Robert Smithโs recommenda-\ntion that the plaintiff receive PegIntron with Ribaviron treat-\nment for Hepatitis C.  Medical Records. \nPlaintiff has used the established inmate grievance process \nseeking treatment for Hepatitis C, albeit without success.  \nVerified Complaint, ยถ 23.  Mr. Brashโs attorneys and his sister \nhave has also written personal letters to defendants requesting \nreconsideration that treatment be restarted without success.  Id. \nDefendants Wexford, Rowe, and Moore have refused to approve \nMr. Brashโs need for a consult with a Gastroenterologist and \nappropriate medication for the treatment of Hepatitis C for non-\nmedical reasons just to save money.  Verified Complaint, ยถ 24. \nDespite the recommendations of three doctors that Mr. Brash \nhave a Gastroenterologist consult, recommendations which were \nendorsed by two of the defendant Wexfordโs own doctors, and \ndespite the recommendation of Wexfordโs own regional medical \ndirector Dr. Richard Smith of Miami that Mr. Brash be restarted \non medication, defendant Rowe, the official at Wexford charged \nwith the duty of determining whether consults and medical regi-\nmens should be approved, rejected the recommendation.  Mr. \nBrashโs prior history, as well as the opinions of Drs. Cecil and \nStone, all point to a clear indication that this court order a \nGastroenterologist consult and that the plaintiff be restarted on \nmedication. \n  ARGUMENT \n \n  - 7 - \n\nPlaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction to require the \ndefendants to approve a Gastroenterologist consult and to immedi-\nately restart him on a medication regimen for his Hepatitis C.  A \npreliminary injunction should issue if the plaintiff successfully \ndemonstrates: \n(1)  a substantial likelihood that he will ultimately pre-\nvail on the merits;  \n \n(2)  that he will suffer irreparable injury if the injunc-\ntion is not issued;  \n \n(3)  that the threatened harm to the plaintiff outweighs the \npotential harm to the opposing party; and \n \n(4)  that the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to \nthe public interest. \n \nHaitian Refugee Center, Inc. v. Nelson, 872 F.2d 1555, 1561-62 \n(11th Cir. 1989), affโd, 498 U.S. 479 (1991); Shatel Corp. v. \nMaota Lumber and Yacht Corp., 697 F.2d 1352, 1354-1355 (11th Cir. \n1983); Canal Authority v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567 (5th Cir. 1974). \n The entry or denial of a preliminary injunction is a decision \nwithin the discretion of the trial court.  Haitian Refugee \nCenter, Inc. v. Nelson, 872 F.2d at 1561. \nThere is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. \n Refusal to approve the recommended consult with a \nGastroenterologist and a medication regimen for Hepatitis C leads \nto potentially irremediable injury, namely liver failure and a \npremature death.  No remedy at law can adequately compensate \nplaintiff for the loss of his liver caused by the refusal of \ndefendants Wexford and Rowe to approve consult recommended by \nthree prison doctors, and to restart him on a mediation regimen \nrecommended by defendant Wexfordโs medical regional director.  \nOnly injunctive relief can provide a meaningful remedy for the \nplaintiff. \n \nA.  A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD EXISTS THAT \nPLAINTIFF WILL PREVAIL ON THE MERITS \n \n \n  - 8 - \n\nTo prevail, plaintiff must establish that one or more of the \ndefendants were deliberately indifferent to a serious medical \nneed.  A medical need is serious if it \"has been diagnosed by a \nphysician as mandating treatment or . . . is so obvious that even \na lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's \nattention.\"  Duran v. Anaya, 642 F. Supp. 510, 524 (D.N.M. 1986). \n See also, Johnson v. Busbee, 953 F.2d 349, 351 (8th Cir. 1991); \nGaudreault v. Municipality of Salem, Mass., 923 F.2d 203, 208 \n(1st Cir. 1990).  โThe existence of an injury that a reasonable \ndoctor or patient would find important and worthy of comment or \ntreatment\" supports a finding of seriousness.  McGuckin v. Smith, \n974 F.2d 1050, 1059-60 (9th Cir. 1992).  Twice, recommendations \nfor a Gastroenterlogist consult have been rejected, and the \nrecommendation that the plaintiff be restarted on a medication \nregimen has also been rejected. \nA medical need is serious if absent treatment there is a \nrisk of long-term or permanent injury.  Greason v. Kemp, 891 F.2d \n829, 836 (11th Cir. 1990).  The risk here is even more grievous. \nIf left untreated, plaintiffโs Hepatitis C will cause Mr. Brashโs \nliver to not function and, unless he gets a transplant, he will \ndie prematurely. \nThe hallmark of deliberate indifference is knowledge of the \nneed for care and the intentional refusal to provide that care.  \nAncata v. Prison Health Services, Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th \nCir. 1985).  In the instant matter, each defendant is fully aware \nof plaintiff's need.  Yet, with full knowledge, for a period of \n \n  - 9 - \n\nnearly a year, defendants have failed and refused to provide \nnecessary treatment.  During this period of time, plaintiffโs \ncondition has steadily worsened. \nDeliberate indifference can be evidenced in many ways.  \nWhere prison doctors and other prison officials ignore the \nrecommendations of specialists, they can be found to be guilty of \ndeliberate indifference.  Harris v. Coweta County, 21 F.3d 388 \n(11th Cir. 1994), superseding 5 F.3d 507 (11th Cir. 1993)(failure \nto follow doctorโs recommendation of a nerve conduction study);  \nWashington v. Dugger, 860 F.2d 1018, 1021 (11th Cir. 1988) \n(failure to return patient to VA hospital for treatment for Agent \nOrange exposure).  See also, Durmer v. O'Carroll, 991 F.2d 64 (3d \nCir. 1993)(failure to provide prescribed physical therapy); Ellis \nv. Butler, 890 F.2d 1001 (8th Cir. 1989)(cancellation of appoint-\nment with knee specialist); Kaminsky v. Rosenblum, 929 F.2d 922 \n(2d Cir. 1991)(failure to act on an outside doctor's recommenda-\ntion of immediate hospitalization); Miltier v. Beorn, 896 F.2d \n848 (4th Cir. 1990)(failure of prison system's chief physician to \nensure that a recommended transfer to a cardiology unit was \ncarried out); Johnson v. Bowers, 884 F.2d 1053 (8th Cir. 1989) \n(failure to provide corrective surgery recommended by a prison \ndoctor provides basis for injunctive relief even where jury finds \nno deliberate indifference on damages claim); Payne v. Lynaugh, \n843 F.2d 177 (5th Cir. 1988)(failure to transfer prisoner to \nfacility with oxygen equipment required for his emphysema); \nLafaut v. Smith, 834 F.2d 389 (4th Cir. 1987)(failure to provide \n \n  - 10 - \n\nrehabilitation therapy despite the recommendation of an orthope-\ndic specialist); Shapley v. Nevada Board of State Prison Commis-\nsioners, 766 F.2d 404 (9th Cir. 1985)(denial of knee surgery \ndespite the repeated recommendations of physicians). \nIf prison officials send prisoners with special needs to \noutside specialists, they are obliged to carry out the special-\nists' orders.  Hamilton v. Endell, 981 F.2d 1063, 1066 (9th Cir. \n1992)(disregard of ear surgeon's direction not to transfer \nprisoner by airplane could constitute deliberate indifference); \nWashington v. Dugger, 860 F.2d at 1019-21 (failure to carry out \nrecommendations of Veterans Administration hospital staff for \nprisoner exposed to Agent Orange could constitute deliberate \nindifference); Martinez v. Mancusi, 443 F.2d 921, 923-25 (2d Cir. \n1970) (removal of surgical patient from hospital against doctor's \norders could constitute deliberate indifference), cert. denied, \n401 U.S. 983 (1971). \nDefendants Wexford and Rowe have adopted the head in the \nsand approach: despite being under state contract to provide \ninmates with medical care, they are not doing so.  As the Supreme \nCourt held in Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, \n1981, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994): \nWhether a prison official had the requisite \nknowledge of a substantial risk is a question \nof fact subject to demonstration in the usual \nways, including inferences from circumstantial \nevidence . . . and a factfinder may conclude \n \n  - 11 - \n\nthat a prison official knew of a substantial \nrisk  from  the  very  fact  that  the  risk  was \nobvious. \nOne Florida Department of Corrections doctor and two of defendant \nWexfordโs own doctors have recommended that the plaintiff see a \ngastroenterologist and resume treatment for Hepatitis C. \nDelaying treatment for a known, potentially fatal problem \nprovides a foundation for a court to find deliberate indiffer-\nence.  Brown v. Hughes, 894 F.2d 1533 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. \ndenied, 496 U.S. 928, 110 S.Ct. 2624, 110 L.Ed.2d 645 (1990) (\"a \ndeliberate delay on the order of hours in providing care for a \nserious and painful broken foot is sufficient to state a consti-\ntutional claim\"); Carswell v. Bay County, 854 F.2d 454 (11th Cir. \n1988) (failure of physician's assistant to notify jail doctor of \nmedical problems). \nWhen defendant Wexfordโs Regional Medical Director in Miami, \nDr. Smith, ordered that the plaintiff resume treatment, his \nrecommendation was countermanded by defendant Wexfordโs Vice \nPresident and Chief Medical Director in Pittsburgh, defendant \nRowe, for financial, not medical reasons.  Since several of the \ndefendantsโ doctors have opined that treatment be resumed for the \nplaintiff, it is a fair inference that the only reason he has not \nbeen given the treatment is monetary.  Failing to provide neces-\nsary medical care for non-medical reasons is, as the cases hold, \ndeliberate indifference.  Ancata v. Prison Health Services, Inc., \n769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th Cir. 1985).  Moreover, cost is not a \ndefense.  Hamm v. Dekalb County, 774 F.2d 1567, 1573 (11th Cir. \n1985); Newman v. Alabama, 559 F.2d 283, 286 (5th Cir. 1977), \nrev'd on other grounds sub nom. Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 98 \nS.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978); Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d \n1291 (5th Cir. 1974).  And see, Mitchell v. Untreiner, 421 \nF.Supp. 886, 896 (N.D. Fla. 1976) (\"It can be succinctly stated \nthat `[l]ack of funds is not an acceptable excuse for unconstitu-\ntional conditions of incarceration.'\"). \n \nB.  PLAINTIFF WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER IRREPARABLE \nINJURY ABSENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n  - 12 - \n\n \nDefendants persist in refusing to approve plaintiff for \ntreatment despite numerous inmate grievances, letters to the \nofficials from the plaintiffโs sister, and formal efforts of \nundersigned counsel.  Absent intervention of the court, it is \nsure that plaintiff will continue to suffer from this progressive \ndisease which, at some point โ assuming that point has not been \nalready reached, may become irreversible.  No after-the-fact \nmonetary remedy can cure plaintiff's injury.  Money damages will \nnot make the plaintiff whole if he eventually loses his liver and \ndies prematurely. \nBy refusing to approve the necessary treatment, as recom-\nmended by qualified specialists, defendants are guilty of delib-\nerate indifference to plaintiffโs  serious medical needs.  Where \na deprivation of constitutional rights is involved, many courts \nhold that no further showing of irreparable harm is necessary. \nHere, however, plaintiff's injury is concrete and real.  Absent \ninjunctive relief, he has no way to obtain medical care that \nseveral specialists have deemed necessary.  Instead, he will \ncontinue to suffer pain and discomfort, and the risk of signifi-\ncant permanent injury and eventually death, if relief is not \nprovided by this Court. \n      C.  THE HARM TO THE PLAINTIFF FAR OUTWEIGHS \nANY HARM WHICH THE INJUNCTION MAY CAUSE \n \n     The harm to plaintiff is clear.  On the other hand, defen-\ndants can show no legally recognizable harm whatsoever to them-\nselves or others if they are required to take steps necessary to \n \n  - 13 - \n\nprovide plaintiff with treatment for Hepatitis C.  That it may \ncost money to provide treatment is not the type of harm which \nwould counsel against the granting of a preliminary injunction.  \nIndeed, to permit defendants to defend against the granting of a \npreliminary injunction by arguing the relatively minimal cost \nhere involved is to legitimatize their unconstitutional conduct. \nPlaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.  He has suffered \nand will continue to suffer irreparable injury absent injunctive \nrelief.  On the other hand, providing the necessary care will not \nharm defendants. \n  D.  HARM TO DEFENDANTS OR THE PUBLIC GENERALLY \nThere simply can be no question of any harm to the defen-\ndants or the public by insuring that the defendants comply with \nthe mandates of the Eighth Amendment.  To the contrary, it is in \nthe public's interest that our officials not believe themselves \nto be above the laws.  As the late U.S. District Court Judge \nCharles Scott stated: \nA free democratic society cannot cage inmates \nlike  animals  in  a  zoo  or  stack  them  like \nchattels  in  a  warehouse  and  expect  them  to \nemerge as decent, law abiding, contributing \nmembers of the community.  In the end, society \nbecomes the loser. \n \nCostello v. Wainwright, 397 F.Supp. 20, 38 (M.D. Fla. 1975) \n(footnotes omitted). \n  CONCLUSION \n     Overall, there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiff \nwill prevail on the merits; that he will continue to suffer \nirreparable injury if an injunction is denied; that granting the \n \n  - 14 - \n\ninjunction is unlikely to cause injury to others; and that the \npublic interest can only be advanced by granting the injunction. \nPlaintiff is without funds.  There are no financial conse-\nquences to defendants should the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction later be reversed.  Therefore, plaintiff requests that \nno bond for security be required.  Orantes-Hernandez v. Smith, \n541 F.Supp. 351, 385-86 n.42 (C.D. Cal. 1982). \nWherefore, for the foregoing reasons, plaintiff respectfully \nrequests that this Court: \n1.  Promptly schedule a hearing; \n2.  Issue a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum requiring \nthe Warden at Okeechobee Correctional Institution to produce \nplaintiff at the hearing; \n3.  Issue a Preliminary Injunction ordering defendants to \nforthwith send plaintiff to a consult with a qualified gastroen-\nterologist to reinstitute medication for his Hepatitis C; \n4.  Waive the posting of a bond for security; and \n5.  Grant such other relief as may be equitable and just. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nRandall C. Berg, Jr., Esq.   \n            Peter M.

      "text": " \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \n \n \nCase No: 02-14331 CIV-PAINE \nMagistrate Judge: Lynch \nALLEN BRASH, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nWEXFORD HEALTH SOURCES, INC., \na Florida corporation, DAVID ROWE, \nand MICHAEL MOORE, in his official \ncapacity as Secretary of the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections, \n   \nDefendants. \n_________________________________/ \n \nDEFENDANTSโ WEXFORD HEALTH SOURCES, INC. and DAVID ROWEโS  \nMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFโS MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION AND MOTION FOR A PROMPT HEARING \n \nDefendants, WEXFORD HEALTH SOURCES, INC. (โWexfordโ) and DAVID ROWE \n(โRoweโ), by and through undersigned counsel, hereby file their Memorandum in Opposition to \nPlaintiffโs Motion Preliminary Injunction and Motion for Prompt Hearing, and state the following:  \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff, Allen Brash, is currently incarcerated at Okeechobee Correctional Institution.  \nPlaintiff seeks to enjoin Defendants by ordering them to refer Plaintiff to a Gastroenterologist so that \nhe may be restarted on Interferon plus Ribavirin for the treatment of his Hepatitis C. \nIn support of his motion, Plaintiff alleges that while he was an inmate at Union Correctional \nFacility, he received Interferon and Ribaviron for an eleventh month period (July 2000 to August \n \n  1 \n\n2001), which did not eliminate the virus, but lowered his viral count to 600IU/ml.   In August of \n2001, Plaintiffโs Interferon treatment was terminated and Dr. Shah, a Board Certified Internist, stated \nthat he should be rechecked in six months, according to Plaintiff, โpresumably [to] be restarted on a \ntreatment regimen for Hepatitis C.โ  Additionally, Dr. Shah charted that Plaintiff should be seen by a \ngastroenterologist by December 10, 2001.   See Plaintiffโs Verified Complaint, ยถ13.   \nPlaintiff was transferred to Okeechobee Correctional Institution in December of 2001.  \nPlaintiff alleges that Wexford and Rowe have refused to refer him to a Gastroenterologist and restart \nhis Interferon treatment and that said refusal amounts to a deliberate indifference to Plaintiffโs \nserious  medical  needs  and  is  in  violation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  of  the  United  States \nConstitution.  Defendant submits the opinion of Dr. Robert Smith, Regional Director of Wexford, \nwho opined that Plaintiff is not a candidate for further Interferon treatment because Plaintiff has \nsubtype 1b Hepatitis C (which is very resistant to Interferon), his biopsy revealed early cirrhosis of \nthe liver (responds poorly to treatment) and eight months following treatment, Plaintiff suffered from \nrebounding viral loads to pretreatment levels. \nII.     STANDARD FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nIn order to warrant a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff bears the burden of proving four \nseparate elements: (1) a substantial likelihood of the success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm if an \ninjunction does not issue; (3) the threatened injury outweighs any harm that might result to the \nPlaintiff; and (4) that public interest will not be served.  See Cuban American Bar Association v. \nChristopher, 43 F. 3d 1412, 1424 (11th Cir.) cert. denied, 515 US 1142 (1995); Church v. City of \nHuntsville, 30 F. 3d 1332, 1341-42 (11th Cir. 1994), NNADI v. Richter, 976 F. 2d 682, 690 (11th Cir. \n1992); Northeastern Florida Chapter Association General Contractors of America v. City of \n \n  2 \n\nJacksonville, 896 F.2d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir. 1990).  If any one of these elements is not met, the \nCourt need not address the other elements and should deny injunctive relief.  See Church, 30 F. 3d at \n1342. \nAs the granting of a preliminary injunction is โan extraordinary and drastic remedyโ, plaintiff \nmust demonstrate that the irreparable harm he will suffer is actual and imminent, and not remote or \nspeculative.   See Tucker Anthony Realty Corp. v. Schesinger, 888 F2d 969, 973 (2nd Cir. 1989).  A \npreliminary injunction must be the only way of protecting a plaintiff from harm.  See Rey v. Guy \nGannett Publishing Co., 766 F.Supp. 1142 (S.D.Fla. 1991).  โThe possibility that adequate . . . \ncorrective relief will be available at a later date, in the ordinary course of litigation, weighs heavily \nagainst the claim for irreparable harm.โ   Samson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974).  \nII.       PLAINTIFF CANNOT MEET HIS BURDEN OF PROOF \n \nAn Eighth Amendment claim of denied of medical care requires a showing that the acts or \nomissions were sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs or \nthe unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.  See  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976).  See \nalso, Brown v. USA, 894 F.2d 1533 (11th Cir. 1990)(an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for denial of \nadequate medical care will be dismissed if it does not allege sufficient facts which would support a \ncharge with deliberate indifference to serious medical needs); Payne v. Monroe Company, 779 \nF.Supp. 1330 (S.D.Fla. 1991); Vaughn v. Kerley, 897 F.Supp 1413 (M.D.Fla. 1995).  It is well \nestablished that the courts are hesitant to find an Eighth Amendment violation once an inmate has \nreceived medical care.    See Hamm v. DeKalb County, supra.   Actions or inactions involving \nmedical treatment violate the Eighth Amendment only if they involve โsomething more than a \nmedical judgment call, an accident, or an inadvertent failure,โ Murrell v. Bennett, 615 F.2d 306, 310 \n \n  3 \n\nn. 4 (5th Cir. 1980).  It must be โso grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the \nconscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.โ  Rogers v. Evans, supra at 1058. \nThe courts have long recognized that a difference of opinion between an inmate and the \nprison medical staff regarding medical matters, including the diagnosis or treatment which the \ninmate receives, cannot in itself rise to the level of a cause of action for cruel and unusual \npunishment.  The propriety of a certain course of medical treatment is not a proper subject for \nreview in a civil rights action.   Estelle v. Gamble, supra, at 107 (matters of medical judgment do \nnot give rise to a ยง1983 claim).  See also, Ledoux v. Davies, 961 F.2d 1536 (10th Cir. 1992) \n(inmateโs belief that he needed additional medication other than that prescribed by treating physician \nwas insufficient to establish constitutional violation); Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. \n1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1041 (1981)(difference of opinion between inmate and prison medical \nstaff regarding treatment or diagnosis does not itself state a constitutional violation); Burns v. Head \nJailor of LaSalle County Jail, 576 F.Supp. 618, 620 (N.D. Ill., E.D. 1984) (exercise of prison \ndoctorโs professional judgment to discontinue prescription for certain drugs not actionable under \nยง1983).  See also, Christy v. Robinson, 216 F.Supp.2d 398, 416 (D.C.N.J. 2002), wherein the court \nheld that โthe Constitution does not guarantee that every prisoner will receive every type of \ntreatment he desires, or even may need.โ   \nIt cannot be disputed that the Plaintiff has received medical care.  According to Dr. Robert \nSmith, Regional Director of Wexford Health Sources, Plaintiff was diagnosed with Chronic \nHepatitis C, Grade II (Mild Periportal Inflammation) and Stage III (Early Septal Fibrosis)(See \nMemorandum from Dr. Robert Smith to T.R. Sucher, III attached hereto as Exhibit โAโ).  Testing \nalso revealed the Genotype to be 1b. (Exhibit โAโ.)  Dr. Rowe states that this type of Hepatitis is \n \n  4 \n\nvery resistant to treatment with Interferon, has a higher failure rate and requires longer periods of \ntreatment. (See Declaration of Dr. Rowe attached hereto as Exhibit โAโ.)  Further, Plaintiffโs liver \nbiopsy revealed pathologic changes indicating that he had early cirrhosis. (Exhibit โAโ.)  Patients \nwith cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis respond poorly to treatment. (Exhibit โAโ.)  Nonetheless, \nPlaintiff was treated by Dr. Shah, an internist, for eleven months September 2000 to August 2001 \nwith Interferon and Ribaviron.  Dr. Smith opined that Plaintiffโs treatment more than met the \nestablished standards of care for his condition and in fact, should have been discontinued at six \nmonths since Plaintiff had detectable serum levels in virus. (Exhibit โAโ.) \nEight months post treatment, a Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV RNA) viral load  \ntest was markedly positive. (Composite Exhibit โBโ.)  These results mean that Plaintiff was an end \nof treatment responder (ETR), but relapsed as evidenced by rebounding viral load pretreatment \nlevels. (Composite Exhibit โBโ.)  Plaintiff is not a candidate for further re-treatment in the form of \nPegylated Interferon Ribaviron therapy for his Hepatitis C condition.  (Composite Exhibit โBโ.) \nPlaintiff files the Affidavit of Dr. Richard Stone, a Board Certified Internist.   Dr Stone is not \na Board Certified Gastroenterogist and according to his Curriculum Vitae, he has no education or \ntraining relevant to treating Hepatitis.  There is nothing in the record to support Dr. Stoneโs opinion \nthat unless Plaintiff receives PEG intron and ribaviron therapy, Plaintiff will die a premature death \ndue to liver failure.   In fact, this opinion is quite different from Dr. Stoneโs letter to the Plaintiffโ \nsister dated March 27, 2002, wherein Dr. Stone states that based on a review of Plaintiffโs medical \nrecords, โI find him to be a candidate for PEG intron and ribaviron therapy.  His viral load \nresponded, albeit, transiently to intron.  Although he failed treatment on intron โ PEG intron therapy \nwould still be indicated in his case.โ  (A copy of said letter is attached hereto as Exhibit โCโ.)   This \n \n  5 \n\nis far a cry from Dr. Stoneโs plea for Plaintiffโs life.   Furthermore, there is nothing in Plaintiffโs \nmedical records to suggest Dr. Shahโs ever recommended that Plaintiff would be restarted on \nInterferon treatment as suggested by Plaintiff.   \nPlaintiff has also filed the affidavit of Dr. Bennet Cecil.  While Dr. Cecil does have \nexperience in the area of Hepatitis C, his declaration is vague in several regards.  In paragraph (3) \nthree of his declaration, Dr. cecil opines that โHepatitis C left untreated may lead to cirrhosis of the \nliver, cancer of the liver and death.โ  Dr. Cecilโs use of the term โmayโ illustrates the speculative \nnature of his opinion.  In paragraph (6) Six of the Declaration, Dr. Cecil contends that if Plaintiff is \nโnot provided the FDA approved PEG Interferon w/ Ribarvin combination therapy, there is a 50%-\n50% chance that he will not survive another 10 years.โ  In a light most favorable to Plaintiff, this \naspect of Dr. Cecilโs opinion clearly does not warrant the granting of a Preliminary Injunction.  In \nParagraphs (9) nine and (10) ten, Dr. Cecil, discusses sustained viral responses to the treatment as \nwell as the use of recent and soon to be FDA approved uses of a combination of drugs.  He \ncompletely fails to address the fact that Plaintiff relapsed following his initial treatment of ribaviron \nand interferon.  The failure to institute recently and soon to be FDA approved combination of drug \ntreatment does not come close to rising to the level of โdeliberate indifference.โ  Additionally, Dr. \nCecil never examined Plaintiff while he was in fact examined by physicians from Wexford. \nThis amounts to nothing more than a difference of opinion of how to properly treat Plaintiffโs \nHepatitis C condition.  As differences of opinion do not rise to the level of deliberate indifference to \nserious medical needs under the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, Plaintiff cannot establish \nthat there is a substantial likelihood he will prevail on the merits.   Where some medical attention has \nbeen provided, allegations of inadequate or improper treatment are insufficient to constitute โcruel \n \n  6 \n\nand unusual punishment.โ  Englerth v. Hetrick, 1988 WL 11660 (S.D. Pa.) quoting Estelle, supra at \n107.   Furthermore, as previously stated, Plaintiff is a non-responder and that further treatment is \nsimply not indicated.   There is nothing in the record to suggest that Plaintiffโs current condition may \nlead to cirrhosis of the liver, cancer of the liver, or death.  This is purely hypothetical.1 \nIV.     MOTION FOR A PROMPT HEARING \nPursuant to Local Rule 7.1B, the granting of a hearing is discretionary and any request shall \nset forth in detail the reasons why a hearing is desired.   Plaintiff has failed to allege circumstances \nthat warrant a prompt hearing or any hearing for that matter.   Plaintiff has failed to allege how a \nhearing will aid the court.  Instead, Plaintiff merely alleges that a prompt hearing is necessary \nbecause Defendants will not provide the Plaintiff with the medication regimen he desperately needs. \n Defendants respectfully submit that a hearing is not necessary as the written submissions by the \nparties have adequately addressed all of the issues in this case. \n \n \n \n \nWHEREFORE, Defendants Wexford and Rowe respectfully request this Court enter an \n                                                 \n1In that Plaintiff has failed to establish the two of the elements for a preliminary \ninjunction, it is unnecessary to address the last two requirement (i.e., that the threatened injury \noutweighs any harm that might result to the plaintiff and that the public interest will not be \nserved).   \n \n  7 \n\nOrder denying Plaintiffโs Motion for Preliminary Injunction and denying Plaintiff Motion for a \nPrompt Hearing, together with any and other relief this Court deems just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nRITTER CHUSID BIVONA & COHEN LLP \nAttorneys for Wexford and Rowe \n7000 W.

Plaintiff seeks temporary, preliminary, and permanent \ninjunctive relief arising from the defendants' deliberate indif-\nference to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  \n  Jurisdiction \n2.  Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1331 in that this is a civil action arising under the \nConstitution of the United States. \n3.  Jurisdiction of the Court is invoked pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1343(a)(3) in that this action seeks to redress the \ndeprivation, under color of state law, of rights secured to the \nplaintiff by the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America. \n\n4.  The plaintiff's claims for relief are predicated upon 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983 which authorizes actions to redress the depriva-\ntion, under color of state law, of rights, privileges, and \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates, and upon 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 which authorizes the award of \nattorney's fees and costs to prevailing plaintiffs in actions \nbrought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n5.  Plaintiff seeks temporary, preliminary and permanent \ninjunctive relief pursuant to Rule 65, Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n  Parties \n6.  Plaintiff, Allen Brash, is a prisoner in the custody of \ndefendant Moore, Secretary of the Florida Department of Correc-\ntions, currently confined at Okeechobee Correctional Institution. \n7.  Defendant, Wexford Health Resources, Inc., (hereinafter \nWexford) is a Florida corporation operating under color of state \nlaw under contract with defendant Moore to provide medical and \nhealth care services to the inmates confined at Okeechobee \nCorrectional Institution. \n8.  Defendant, David Rowe, is Vice President and Chief \nMedical Director for defendant Wexford Health Sources, Inc.  As \nChief Medical Director, defendant Rowe makes policy under color \nof state law for Wexford by determining who is allowed to receive \nmedical care recommended by defendant Wexfordโs prison doctors. \n9.  Defendant Michael Moore, is the Secretary of the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections.  He acts under color of state law.  As \n \n  - 2 - \n\nSecretary, he is the highest ranking official of the Department \nof Corrections and is responsible for the medical care of all \ninmates.  He is sued in his official capacity for injunctive \nrelief, attorneys fees and costs. \n  Factual Allegations \n10.  Plaintiff came into the custody of the Florida Depart-\nment of Corrections in 1987. \n11.  Plaintiff has an advanced stage of Hepatitis C and is \nin the early stage of cirrhosis, a condition which can be caused \nby the Hepatitis C virus (HCV).  If Hepatitis C is left un-\ntreated, it may lead to liver failure, cancer of the liver, and \ndeath. \n    12.  Until December 2001, the plaintiff was housed at Union \nCorrectional Institution under the care of Dr. Shah, a Gastroen-\nterologist at the North Florida Reception Center employed by the \nFlorida Department of Corrections.  Dr. Shah treated the plain-\ntiff with Interferon and plaintiffโs condition improved. \n13.  A hepatitis patient is deemed cured when his viral \nloads fall to zero.  Although plaintiff responded favorably to \ntreatment, the treatment did not eliminate the virus completely, \nhis viral counts fell to less than 600IU/ml.  At the end of the \n11 month treatment period, in August 2001, Dr. Shah charted that \nthe plaintiff should be checked after 6 months for a liver \nprofile and presumably be restarted on a treatment regimen for \nHepatitis C.  On October 10, 2001, Dr. Shah charted that the \nplaintiff should be scheduled to see a Gastroenterologist by \n \n  - 3 - \n\nDecember 10, 2001.  Before plaintiff could see a Gastroenterolo-\ngist, Mr. Brash was transferred to Okeechobee Correctional \nInstitution.   \n14.  Plaintiff came under the medical care of defendant \nWexford and its prison doctor, Dr. Bhadja, at Okeechobee Correc-\ntional Institution.  Another Gastroenterologist Consult was \nrecommended for the plaintiff on January 23, 2002, this time by \nDr. Bhadja.  The consult recommendation was denied by defendant \nDavid Rowe on January 28, 2002.  On January 30, 2002, Dr. Diaz, \nanother Wexford prison doctor at Okeechobee Correctional Institu-\ntion charted, โthis patient [Mr. Brash] is a treatment failure.  \nHe should not be treated again.  Follow up yearly for Hep C.โ \n15.  Plaintiff has not seen a Gastroenterologist after his \nmedical care was assumed by defendants Wexford and Rowe from mid-\nDecember 2001 until the present despite the recommendations of \nthree prison doctors, two of whom are employed by defendant \nWexford and one by defendant Moore. \n16.  Plaintiffโs condition is such that if he is not pro-\nvided the FDA approved PEG Interferon with Ribavirin combination \ntherapy, there is a 50%-50% chance that he will not survive \nanother 10 years. \n17.  Plaintiff is a curable patient.  But since he has \nsevere fibrosis, plaintiff needs treatment to prevent his prema-\nture death.  Cirrhosis, or a massive scarring of the liver, \nfollows long-term infection from the virus.  Cirrhosis leads to \n \n  - 4 - \n\nliver cancer or liver failure.  Absent a transplant, death \nfollows. \n18.  Liver disease and especially end stage liver failure is \na prolonged, and often gruesome, death.  As scar tissue replaces \nhealthy cells, liver function starts to fail and a person may \nexperience the following symptoms: exhaustion, fatigue, loss of \nappetite, nausea, weakness and weight loss.  These are usually \nearly signs of liver failure which can lead to the complications \nof cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. \n19.  Plaintiffโs HCV virus will not be eradicated without \ntreatment.  In August 2001 the FDA approved the combination of \nPeginterferon and the nucleoside analogue Ribaviron for patients \nwith chronic HCV infection.  \n20.  Unless plaintiff receives immediate treatment with \nPegylated Interferon and Ribavirin therapy, plaintiff will die a \npremature death due to liver failure or to liver cancer.  If he \nis successfully treated, he has a normal life expectancy. \n21.  In June 2002, Dr. Robert Smith, regional medical \ndirector for defendant Wexford recommended that the plaintiff be \nrestarted on Pegintron and Ribaviron therapy treatment.  Plain-\ntiff was told that he could expect treatment to begin in 8 weeks. \n In late June, plaintiff was informed that someone countered Dr. \nSmithโs recommendation, and plaintiff would not be restarted on \ntreatment as promised. \n \n  - 5 - \n\n22.  Defendant David Rowe rejected Dr. Robert Smithโs \nrecommendation that the plaintiff receive Pegintron with \nRibaviron treatment for Hepatitis C. \n23.  Defendant Moore has similarly denied plaintiffโs \nadministrative remedies for medical care using the inmate griev-\nance procedure and after requests to his regional medical direc-\ntor seeking treatment for Hepatitis C.  Plaintiff has also \nwritten personal letters to defendants requesting reconsideration \nthat treatment be restarted albeit without success. \n24.  Defendants Wexford, Rowe and Moore have refused to \napprove plaintiffโs need for a consult with a Gastroenterologist \nand appropriate medication for the treatment of Hepatitis C for \nnon-medical reasons just to save money. \n  Claim for Relief \n25.  With full knowledge of plaintiff's history of Hepatitis \nC and his need to start a retreatment regimen within 6 months \nfrom the date he ceased treatment, and with full knowledge that \nDr. Shah, plaintiffโs treating physician at North Florida Recep-\ntion Center had recommended that plaintiff see a Gastroenterolo-\ngist in mid-December, 2002, defendants Wexford and Rowe disap-\nproved Dr. Shahโs recommendation that plaintiff have a specialist \n[Gastroenterologist] consult for plaintiffโs Hepatitis C so he \nmight restart his treatment regimen. \n26.  With full knowledge of plaintiff's history of Hepatitis \nC, and with full knowledge that Dr. Bhadja had recommended that \nplaintiff see a Gastroenterologist for a consult, defendants \n \n  - 6 - \n\nWexford and Rowe disapproved Dr. Bhadjaโs recommendation that the \nplaintiff see a Gastroenterologist for plaintiffโs Hepatitis C so \nhe might restart a treatment regimen.  \n27.  With full knowledge of plaintiff's history of Hepatitis \nC, and with full knowledge that defendant Wexfordโs Regional \nMedical Director in Miami, Dr. Robert Smith, had recommended that \nplaintiff be restarted on Pegintron with Ribavirin medication for \nHepatitis C, defendants Wexford and Rowe disapproved the plain-\ntiff from restarting his treatment regimen as Dr. Smith had \nrecommended for financial, not medical, reasons.  Defendant Moore \nhas also refused to restart the plaintiff on a treatment regimen \nafter similar requests that he intervene. \n28.  Defendants Wexford, Rowe, and Moore know that Hepatitis \nC is a progressive disease and that, absent treatment, the \nplaintiffโs liver will eventually stop functioning and unless he \nhas a liver transplant, he will die. \n29.  In refusing to approve the Gastroenterologist consulta-\ntions recommended by Dr. Shah and Dr. Bhadja, defendants Wexford, \n Rowe, and Moore are being deliberately indifferent to the \nserious medical needs of plaintiff, in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment. \n30.  In refusing to approve the medication regimen for \nHepatitis C recommended by Dr. Robert Smith, defendants Wexford, \nRowe, and Moore are being deliberately indifferent to the serious \nmedical needs of plaintiff, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \n \n  - 7 - \n\n31.  As the direct result of the refusal of defendants \nWexford, Rowe, and Moore, plaintiffโs Hepatitis C has gone \nuntreated for nearly a year, his liver is being damaged, and his \nlife expectancy shortened. \n32.  Absent intervention of this Court, plaintiffโs Hepati-\ntis C will continue to worsen to the point that he will have to \nhave a liver transplant or he will die prematurely. \n33.  The acts of defendants have caused plaintiff great \ndiscomfort, pain, disfigurement, disability, and mental and \nemotional suffering. \nWHEREFORE, plaintiff requests that this Court:  \nA.  Declare that the conduct of the defendants, as alleged, \nviolates plaintiff's right to be free from cruel and unusual \npunishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution; \nB.  Enter temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive \nrelief requiring defendants Wexford, Rowe, and Moore, their \nsuccessors in office, and their servants, agents and employees, \nand those acting in concert with him, to immediately schedule the \nrecommended consultant review by a Gastroenterologist and the \nmedication regimen needed for Hepatitis C for plaintiff; \nC.  Award attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1988; and \nD.  Grant plaintiff such other and further relief as the \nCourt may deem just and equitable. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n  - 8 - \n\nRandall C. Berg, Jr., Esq.   \n            Peter M.

      "text": "  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n  SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \n  Ft. Pierce Division \n \n  Case No. 02-14331-Civ-Paine/Lynch \n \n  \nALLEN BRASH,        ) \n) \n         Plaintiff,     ) \n) \nv.            )   \n) \nWEXFORD HEALTH SOURCES, INC., ) \na Florida corporation, DAVID  ) \nROWE, and MICHAEL MOORE, in   ) \nhis official capacity as   ) \nSecretary of the Florida   ) \nDepartment of Corrections,  ) \n) \n         Defendants.    ) \n                              ) \n \n  PLAINTIFFโS REPLY MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTSโ \n  RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFFโS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nDefendants Wexford, Rowe and Moore have improperly framed \nthe issue before this Court on plaintiffโs motion for a prelimi-\nnary injunction.  All defendants would like to characterize the \nissue as whether the โpropriety of a certain courseโ or โtype of \n treatmentโ is actionable under ยง 1983 as an 8th Amendment viola-\ntion.  That mischaracterizes the facts as alleged in the verified \ncomplaint and plaintiffโs medical records, and could well lead \nthis Court into error, not to mention shorten plaintiffโs life \nspan due to defendantsโ continued intentional delay in his \nobtaining medication. \n1.  Three Doctors Employed by the Defendants Have \nRecommended Treatment; All to be Denied by Dr. \nRowe For Monetary -- Not Medical -- Reasons. \n\nThe factual record to date demonstrates -- and defendants \nhave not produced one scintilla of evidence to refute it -- that \nthree doctors, all employed by these defendants, have recommended \nthat Mr. Brash be retreated for Hepatitis C.  Thus, the argument \nis not over the โtypeโ or โpropriety of treatmentโ the plaintiff \ndesires or needs, it is over whether the plaintiff is getting the \nvery treatment that his treating physicians have recommended. \nIt bears repeating here which treating physicians have \nrecommended that Mr. Brash should be retreated, only to have \ntheir recommendations denied by Dr. Rowe.  First, Dr. Shah, a \nGastroenterologist at the North Florida Reception Center employed \nby the Florida Department of Corrections, charted that the \nplaintiff should be scheduled to see a Gastroenterologist by \nDecember 10, 2001.  Before plaintiff could see a Gastroenterolo-\ngist, Mr. Brash was transferred to Okeechobee Correctional \nInstitution.  (Comp., ยถ 13). \nPlaintiff then came under the medical care of defendant \nWexford and its prison doctor, Dr. Bhadja, at Okeechobee Correc-\ntional Institution.  Another Gastroenterologist Consult was \nrecommended for the plaintiff on January 23, 2002, this time by \nDr. Bhadja.  The consult recommendation was denied by defendant \nDavid Rowe on January 28, 2002.   \n On June 12, 2002, Dr. Robert Smith, defendant Wexfordโs \nRegional Medical Director in Miami, recommended that Mr. Brash be \nretreated with Pegasys plus Ribavirin.  Indeed, it is charted in \nMr. Brashโs medical records on June 12, 2002, that Dr. Bhadja, \n \n  - 2 - \n\nWexfordโs Medical Director at Okeechobee Correctional Institu-\ntion, that the plaintiff receive โPeginterferon and Ribavirin,โ \njust as Dr. Smith had ordered.  See, Exhibit A, attached pre-\nscription form.1  Then just 6 days later on June 18, 2002, there \nis another entry in the medication and prescription orders to \nโhold Ribavirin and Interferon until further order from Dr. \nSmith.โ  Id.  No further order to dispense Ribavirin and Inter-\nferon has been forthcoming.  This prescription order, just like \nthe order of Dr. Brash to see a Gastroenterologist, was counter-\nmanded by Dr. Rowe, Wexfordโs Corporate Vice President and \nMedical Director, purely for cost saving reasons.  In short, Mr. \nBrash has not received any medical care or treatment for his \nHepatitis C since he arrived at OCI in December 2001. \nThe Eleventh Circuit has consistently held that โknowledge \nof the need for medical and the intentional refusal to provide it \nconstitutes deliberate indifference to oneโs serious health care \nneeds.โ  Ancata v. Prison Health Services, 769 F.2d 700, 703-704 \n(11th Cir. 1985).  โA core principle of Eighth Amendment juris-\nprudence in the area of medical care is that prison officials \nwith knowledge of the need for care may not, by failing to \nprovide care, delaying care, or providing grossly inadequate \ncare, cause a prisoner to needlessly suffer the pain resulting \nfrom his or her illness.โ  McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, \n                     \n1This prescription form and all plaintiffโs medical records \nwere previously filed on December 6, 2002.  DE 5. \n \n  - 3 - \n\n1257 (11th Cir. 1999).  The failure to follow the recommendations \nof treating physicians is clearly recognized as rising to the \nlevel of a constitutional claim.  Washington v. Dugger, 860 F.2d \n1018, 1021 (11th Cir. 1988)(refusal of Department of Correctionsโ \ndoctors to follow the recommendations of treating physicians from \nthe Veterans Administration).  And failure to provide or to delay \nmedical care for non-medical reasons [costs] makes out a case for \ndeliberate indifference.  Ancata, 769 F.2d 704.  \n2.  Defendants Wexford and Rowe Fail to Counter the Actions \nof Dr. Rowe Through the Submissions of Expert Declara-\ntions and a Memo \nDefendants Wexfordโs and Roweโs submission of three experts \nfail to counter the actions of Dr. Roweโs denial of medical \ntreatment.  Each submission is fraught with glaring omissions and \nproblems. \nFirst, defendants Wexford and Rowe submitted as Exhibit A to \ntheir Response a memo of Dr. Robert Smith dated April 2, 2002.  \nIt should first be noted that this is simply a memo, not an \naffidavit or declaration.  More importantly, as set forth above \nand in the verified complaint at bar, Dr. Smith changed his \nopinion after writing this April memo.  On June 12, 2002 he \nordered the plaintiff be retreated with Peg interferon with \nRibavirin, only later to have his recommendation countered by Dr. \nRowe on June 18, 2002.  Dr. Smith could not submit an affidavit \nor declaration countering or calling into question what the \n \n  - 4 - \n\nplaintiff alleged in the verified complaint without committing \nperjury. \nSecond, defendant Rowe submits his own self-serving declara-\ntion as Exhibit B to defendantsโ Response to Plaintiffโs Motion \nfor a preliminary Injunction.  Dr. Roweโs declaration fails to \nchallenge the verified complaintโs allegations that he countered \nDr. Bhadjaโs recommendations for further treatment on not one, \nbut two occasions, and that he has refused to provide Mr. Brash \nwith Pegintron with Ribavirin solely to save money.  Instead, he \nattempts to justify his decision that Mr. Brash does not need \ntreatment for Hepatitis C.  As the Rebuttal Declaration of Dr. \nCecil being filed contemporaneously with this submission attests: \nDr. Roweโs statement that โthere is no factual evidence \nin Mr. Brashโs records to suggest that his current \ncondition may lead to cirrhosis of the liver, cancer of \nthe liver, and death.  This is purely hypothetical,โ is \nsimply incorrect.  It is indicative of Dr. Roweโs lack \nof knowledge of Hepatitis C, Mr. Brashโs condition, and \nhis immediate need for treatment.  If the progression \nof this disease were not of any concern, or โpurely \nhypotheticalโ as Dr. Rowe suggests, then one has to \nanswer the question why did Dr. Shah put Mr. Brash on \ninterferon and Ribaviron for 11 months from September \n2000 to August 2001? \n \n  - 5 - \n\nRebuttal Declaration of Dr. Bennet Cecil, February 13, 2003, ยถ \n6.2  \n                     \n2Dr. Cecil it should be noted feels so strongly that Mr. \nBrash is an excellent candidate for retreatment, he has provided \nhis services here to date pro bono and has agreed to consult pro \nbono on Mr. Brashโs retreatment if so ordered by the court. \n \n  - 6 - \n\nThird, defendants Wexford and Rowe later filed the declara-\ntion of Dr. Michael Fried.  Dr. Friedโs declaration is also \nfaulty and extremely questionable.  It contains improper conclu-\nsory statements about the NIH Consensus Panel Statementโs factors \nconcerning the โretreatment of patientsโ which should be \nstricken.  As Dr. Cecil points out in his declaration, the NIH \nStatement lists five factors which a doctor should consider in \ndetermining whether a patient needs retreatment.  See Declaration \nof Dr. Cecil, ยถ 4.  Dr. Fried notes the existence of these \nfactors in the Panel Statement and then leaps to the conclusion \nthat Mr. Brash is not deserving of retreatment.  Conclusory \nstatements are improper.  Dr. Cecil then goes through the five \nfactors, weighs the plaintiffโs status as to each factor, and \nthen concludes Mr. Brash is a curable patient who if not treated \nin the very near future will suffer an early death as the result \nof Hepatitis C and the associated medical problems, including \nliver cancer and liver failure, that it causes.  Id.  He con-\ncludes that โ[t]ime is of the essence in Mr. Brashโs instance, \nand retreatment with Pegasys with Ribavirin should be started \nright away.โ  Id.  Based on the reasons set forth in Dr. Cecilโs \ndeclaration, Dr. Friedโs declaration should be ignored if not \nstricken.3       \n3.  Plaintiff Has Satisfied the Four Prongs Required for \nthe Issuance of a Preliminary Injunction \n                     \n3Plaintiff is filing contemporaneously with this Reply a \nMotion to Strike Dr. Friedโs Declaration as being conclusory. \n \n  - 7 - \n\nPlaintiff has met the four requirements for the issuance of \na preliminary injunction.  And, if there is still any doubt, \nplaintiff would welcome an evidentiary hearing as requested on \nDecember 6thโs Motion for a Prompt Hearing. \nDefendants are really just arguing over the preliminary \ninjunction requirements of one and two -- likelihood of success \non the merits, and irreparable injury.  As to the first prong, \nlikelihood of success on the merits, there can be no doubt that \nthe plaintiff has not received the first ounce of medical treat-\nment for Hepatitis C since he arrived at OCI in December 2001.  \nThe only treatments which were recommended were (1) that he \nreceive a Gastroenterologist consult, ordered on January 23, \n2002, and (2) that he receive peg intron and Ribavirin, ordered \non June 12, 2002.  Both treatments were denied by Dr. Rowe. \nThus, all of the defendantsโ statements that this is really \njust an argument over the โproprietyโ and โtype of treatmentโ is \nsimply hot air.  The same is true for their statement that he has \nreceived โsomeโ medical treatment since arriving at OCI.  In-\nstead, this is a lawsuit about a man who will die an early death \nif he does receive the very medical treatment the defendantsโ \nthree treating physicians have recommended. \nAs to the second prong -- irreparable injury will be suf-\nfered unless the injunction issues -- there can be no doubt that \nHepatitis C is a deadly disease.  And if Mr. Brash is not treated \nin the very near future, he will suffer an early death as the \nresult of Hepatitis C and the associated medical problems, \n \n  - 8 - \n\nincluding liver cancer and liver failure, that it causes.  As Dr. \nCecil states โtime is of the essence in Mr. Brashโs instance, and \nretreatment with Pegasys with Ribavirin should be started right \naway.โ  Id.  He can not wait until the โcompletion of specific \nstudies in the field of treatment of Hepatitis Cโ as Dr. Fried \nsuggests in ยถ 12 of his Declaration.  For Mr. Brash does not have \nany alternatives.  He can not just walk out of prison and be \ntreated with Pegasys with Ribavirin.  If this Court does not \nissue a preliminary injunction, Mr. Brash will suffer an early \ndeath.          \nFor the reasons set forth above and in the other pleadings \nfiled herein, plaintiff requests the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction ordering that he receive treatment and medication for \nhis Hepatitis C. \n              Respectfully submitted, \n \nRandall C.

The Plaintiff filed Objections \non March 14, 2003, (D.E. 49), the Defendants filed a Response to the Plaintiffs Objections on \nMarch 24,2003 (D.E 52), and March 252003 (D.E. 53), and the Plaintiff replied on April 2, 2003 \n(D.E.54). \nHaving made a de novo review oft he Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation, this \nCourt concludes that it should be reversed as explained below. 28 U.S.C. ยง636(b)(l), United States \nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 673 (1980), Jeffrey S. v. State Bd. ofEduc., 896 F.2d 507, 512-13 (lIth \nCir. 1990). \n1 \n\n.J \nIn the Report and Recommendation, the Honorable Frank J. Lycnh Jr. found! : \nI.  The Plaintiff has been in the custody of the Florida Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") \nsince 1987. He currently suffers from Hepatitis C and is in the second stage of cirrhosis oft he liver. \nIfH  epatitis C is left untreated, it may lead to death from either further cirrhosis oft he liver or cancer \nof the liver. \n2.  The Plaintiff was housed at the Union Correctional Institution and received medical care \nfrom Dr. Shah, a gastroenterologist specialist employed by the DOC. Dr. Shah placed the Plaintiff \non an eleven month treatment of Interferon.  At the end the treatment period, in August 200 I, Dr. \nShah examined the Plaintiff, fmding that although he had responded favorably, the medication did \nnot completely eliminate the virus.  Dr. Shah charted the Plaintiff to have a liver profile in six \nmonths, and the Plaintiff presumes that his treatment regimen was to be restarted then. In October \n10,2001, Dr. Shah charted that the Plaintiff be scheduled to see a gastroenterologist by December \nof that year. \n3.  Before he was  able  to  see a  gastroenterologist,  the Plaintiff was  transferred to  the \nOkeechobee Correctional Institution where he is currently housed. There he came under the medical \ncare ofthe Defendant Wexford Health Sources, Inc., and its prison doctor, Dr. Bhadja. Dr. Bhadja \nalso recommended that the Plaintiff see a gastroenterologist but the recommendation was denied by \nthe Defendant Dr. David Rowe on January 28, 2002.  Dr. Rowe is the Vice President and Chief \n!Neither the Plaintiff nor the Defendants objected to the statement offa cts issued in the \nReport and Recommendation. \n2Specifically, Dr. Robert Smith, Regional Director of Wexford Health Source, states that \nthe Plaintiff was diagnosed with Chronic Hepatitis C, Grade II (Mild Periportal Inflammation) \nand Stage III (Early Septal Fibrosis). \n2 \n\n) \n.. \n'.> \nMedical Director for Wexford Health Sources, Inc., at its Pittsburgh head office, and as such, he \nmakes determinations regarding the provision of medical care.  Soon thereafter, on January 30, \n2002, another Wexford prison doctor, Dr. Diaz, charted that the Plaintiff \"is a treatment failure. He \nshould not be treated again.  Follow up yearly for Hep C.\"  In April 2002, Dr. Robert Smith, \nWexford's regional medical director, wrote a memorandum concurring with Dr. Diaz's assessment \nthat the Plaintiff is a treatment failure in light of his relapse. \n4.  However, in June 2002, Dr. Robert Smith changed his opinion and recommended that the \nPlaintiff be restarted on pegylated interferon with ribavirin, for which Dr. Bhadja charted him for \nsuch treatment.  Six days later on June 18,2002, Dr. Rowe rejected this recommended course of \ntreatment, instructing that the medication be held until further order.  The Plaintiff has not been \nexamined by a gastroenterologist since being under the care of Dr. Shah at the Union Correctional \nInstitution. \n5.  In his Declaration in support of the Plaintiffs Motion, Dr.  Bennet Cecil, a Hepatitis \nspecialist, explained this new treatment as such: \n\"in August 2001  the FDA approved the combination of Peginterferon and the \nnucleoside analogue Ribavirin for patients with  chronic HCV infection.  This \ncombination ofP  egi nterferon plus Rebetol permits a sustained virologic response of \napproximately 40% in genotype 1 with higherrates in genotypes 2 and 3. Mr. Brash \nis a genotype 1.  The FDA approved Pegasys for treatment of HCV cirrhosis on \nOctober 16, 2002 ... Ribavirin should be added in January when the FDA approves \nit ... Since the approval of pegylated interferon, they have become the standard of \ncare  for  treatment  of HCV.  Pegylated  interferon  are  superior  to  ordinary \ninterferons.\" \n6.  The Plaintiff has used the established inmate grievance process to request treatment but \nwithout success, and his attorneys and sister have also written letters to the Defendants.  The \n3 \n\n) \nPlaintiff alleges that the Defendants have denied this treatment for non-medical reasons, namely to \nsave money. \nIn the Report and Recommendation, the Honorable Frank J. Lynch Jr., found that the \nPlaintiffhad not made the requisite showing to support the issuance of a preliminary injunction. He \nfurther stated that, \"while this court is cognizant oft he Plaintiff's medical condition, this Court fmds \nno immediate urgency that carmot wait further deliberation.\" (D.E. 46).  In his objection, the \nPlaintiff argues several errors were made below, and that the Plaintiff did make the requisite \nshowing in support of the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  This Court is persuaded by the \nPlaintiff's arguments. \nThis Court finds that the Plaintiff has established a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits.  The Eleventh Circuit has held that [i]n order to state a cognizable claim, a prisoner must \nallege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical \nneeds. McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1254 (11 th Cir. 1999).  An official acts with deliberate \nindifference when he or she knows that an inmate is in serious need of medical care, but fails or \nrefuses to obtain medical treatment for the inmate. Id. at 1255.  The Defendants in the case at bar \nknow the Plaintiffhas Hepatitis C, and Cirrhosis oft he liver, yet they have not provided any medical \ntreatment or care for the Plaintiff in regard to his Hepatitis or Cirrhosis.  Furthermore, all of the \nPlaintiff's treating physicians, save Dr. Diaz, have specifically requested that he be examined by a \nspecialist and/or be placed on the FDA's new treatment for Hepatitis C. \nThis Court also finds that the Plaintiff has established a substantial threat of irreparable \ninjury if relief is not granted.  The Plaintiff has already been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. \n4 \n\n\"  ,. \nThe Court notes that the Defendants do not dispute that the Hepatitis is currently causing the \ncirrhosis (if not to the degree of death) or that the damage caused by the cirrhosis is permanent. \nUpon due consideration of said motion, the opposition thereto, and the record, the Court \nfinds that the Plaintiff has a cause of action for a violation of his Eight Amendment right to medical \n3 \ncare, and has met the four requirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction; namely: \n(1)  substantial likelihood of success on the merits; \n(2)  substantial threat of irreparable injury if relief \nis not granted; \n(3)  the threatened injury to the movant outweighs the \nharm the injunction would do to the defendant; and \n(4) the granting of the injunction is in the public \ninterest. \nTherefore, it is hereby \nORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows: \n(1) The Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation of March 4,2003, is REVERSED. \nThe Plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED. \n(2) Pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Defendants shall: \n(a) immediately send the Plaintiff to a Gastroenterologist; \n(b) should said Gastroenterologist find that future medical treatment for the Plaintiff's \nHepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver is required, such treatment shall immediately be \n3Neither Defendants address the issues, or point to any harm that would result ifthe \ninjunction were to be granted or harm to the public interest. \n5 ",
