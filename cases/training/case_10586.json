Plaintiffs alleged that the beatings and torture were afflicted primarily by members of CERT Team (\"Correctional Emergency Response Team\").

      "text": "Case 7:08-cv-00005-HL   Document 42   Filed 03/25/09   Page 1 of 4\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF GEORGIA\nVALDOSTA DIVISION\nASTANIEL JARVIS MANN, et al., :\n:\nPlaintiffs, :\n:\nv. :  Civil Action No. 7:08-cv-5 (HL)\n:\nCOMMISSIONER JAMES DONALD, :\net al., :\n:\nDefendants. :\n______________________________\nORDER\nThis matter is before the Court on the Recommendation (Doc. 33) of United\nStates  Magistrate  Judge  Richard  L.  Hodge,  entered  February  24,  2009.    The\nMagistrate Judge recommends that the claims of five of the seven named plaintiffs be\ndismissed, and that seven Defendants, along with two John Doe Defendants, be\ndismissed.  Plaintiffs and Defendants have filed objections to the Recommendation.\nBefore addressing the Recommendation on the merits, the Court must first address the\ntimeliness of the partiesโ objections.\nThe  Magistrate  Judge  entered  his  Recommendation  on  the  docket  on\nFebruary 24, 2009.  As directed in the Recommendation, and as specified in 28\nU.S.C.A. ยง 636(b)(1)(C) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), the parties had the\nright to โserve and file written objectionsโ within โten days after being served with a\ncopyโ of the Recommendation.  When timely objections are filed, the district court must\n\nCase 7:08-cv-00005-HL   Document 42   Filed 03/25/09   Page 2 of 4\nmake a de novo determination of those portions of the Recommendation as to which\nobjection is made.  28 U.S.C.A. ยง 636(b)(1)(C); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  If no timely\nobjections are filed, the Court considers the Recommendation for clear error.  Macort\nv.  Prem,  Inc.,  No.  06-12316,  2006  WL  3473734,  *2  (11th  Cir.  Nov.  30,  2006)\n(unpublished opinion) (quoting the Fourth Circuit and stating, โMost circuits agree that\nโ[i]n the absence of a timely filed objection, a district court need not conduct a de novo\nreview, but instead must only satisfy itself that there is no clear error on the face of the\nrecord in order to accept the recommendation.โโ)\nPlaintiffsโ objections were filed on March 16, 2009.1  According to the Courtโs\ncalculations the objections were due on March 13, 2009.  Plaintiffsโ time for filing\nobjections began to run when the Recommendation was entered on the docket on\nFebruary 24, 2009, at which time the parties were served with electronic notice of the\ndocketing, as authorized by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b)(2)(E).  Pursuant to\nRule 5(b)(2)(E), when service is made by electronic means, โservice is complete upon\ntransmission.โ  Service was thus complete on Plaintiffs, whose attorney was served by\nelectronic means, on February 24, 2009.  Plaintiffs were thus required to serve and file\nwritten objections within ten days after being served on February 24, 2009.\n1 The objections, which consist of 61 pages, were accompanied by a motion seeking\npermission to exceed the page limit.  Because the Court finds that the objections were not\ntimely filed, it will not address the length of the objections or the timeliness of the motion to\nexceed the page limitation.  Plaintiffsโ Motion for Permission to Exceed the Page Limitation\n(Doc. 38) is moot.\n2\n\nCase 7:08-cv-00005-HL   Document 42   Filed 03/25/09   Page 3 of 4\nThe rules for computing time set forth at Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6, direct\nthat the day of service is not included in calculating the ten days, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n6(a)(1), nor are intermediate legal holidays, Saturdays, or Sundays, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n6(a)(2).  The last day of the period is counted unless it is a legal holiday, a Saturday,\nor a Sunday.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(3).  Applying these rules, therefore, the first day of\nthe ten began on February 25, 2009, and the last day of the ten fell on March 10, 2009,\na Tuesday. Rule 6 also provides for the addition of three days after the period would\notherwise expire if service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(E), as was the case here.  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 6(d).  After adding these three days, the Court finds that Plaintiffsโ objections\nwere due on March 13, 2009, a Friday.  Having been filed on March 16, 2009, the\nobjections were not timely.\nThe Court similarly finds that Defendantsโ objections were not timely filed.\nDefendantsโ  objections  were  filed  on  March  18,  2009,  two  days  after  Plaintiffsโ\nobjections were filed.  Thus the Courtโs counting analysis as applied to Plaintiffs would\napply with even greater force to Defendantsโ objections.2  Having concluded that the\nobjections of both parties are untimely, the Court will consider the Recommendation\n2 The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow a party to respond to another partyโs\nobjections.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  A response to an objection must be filed within ten days\nof being served with a copy of the objections.  Id.  If Defendantsโ objections could be deemed\nas a response to Plaintiffsโ objections, under Rule 72(b)(2), they would be timely.  However,\nnothing in Defendantsโ objections suggests that they were intended to be a response to\nPlaintiffsโ objections.  Moreover, because the Court is not considering Plaintiffsโ objections,\nthere would be no reason for it to consider Defendantsโ response to the objections.\n3\n\nCase 7:08-cv-00005-HL   Document 42   Filed 03/25/09   Page 4 of 4\nfor clear error.  Under this standard, and after review, the Court finds no error in the\nMagistrate Judgeโs conclusions.  Accordingly, the Court accepts the Recommendation\nof the Magistrate Judge.  Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 18) is granted, in part,\nand denied, in part, as more fully set forth in the Recommendation.  Plaintiffโs Motion\nto Exceed the Page Limitation (Doc. 38) is moot, as addressed previously in this Order.\nThis matter is hereby recommitted to the Magistrate Judge for such further proceedings\nas may be appropriate, including but not limited to, Plaintiffsโ Motion to Certify Class\n(Doc. 16).\nSO ORDERED, this the 25th  day of March, 2009.\ns/   Hugh Lawson                          \nHUGH LAWSON, SENIOR JUDGE\nmls\n4",

The CERT Teams wearing special black uniforms with hard toe \nblack combat boots for kicking and black leather gloves specially padded on \nthe outside of the knuckles for hitting have a pattern and practice of beating \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 22 of 96\nand  kicking  restrained  inmates  that  serves  no  penological  purpose.  The \npattern and practice of CERT Teams administering beatings of restrained \ninmates utilizing premeditated violence as summary punishment includes, \nbut is not limited to: \n1. beating prisoners after they are restrained in handcuffs behind their \nbacks;\n2. administering beatings after there is a massive imbalance of force; \n3. wearing black leather beating gloves which are specially designed for \nbeating with thin padding only on the outside of the knuckles that are \nissued by the Department of Corrections; \n4. kicking prisoners offensively using hard toe black combat boots that \nare issued by the Department of Correction; \n5. using radios as weapons; \n6. slamming inmates on the ground and running their heads into walls \nand doors; \n7. using profanity with racial and sexual innuendos; \n8. not following Standard Operating Procedures on use of video camera; \n9. beating prisoners in surreptitious locations such as showers, alcoves, \nand empty rooms; \n10. covering up beating in use of force reports; \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 23 of 96\n11. using medical staff to cover up beatings; \n12. covering up and condoning beatings by wardens and deputy wardens \nof security; \n13. covering up of beatings by internal affairs; \n14. putting  inmates  who  have  been  beaten  in  lockdown  segregation \nfacilities to avoid observation of their injuries; \n15. not allowing inmates who have been beaten to see their families or to \nhave picture taken of their injuries; \n16. thwarting  prison  grievance  procedure  to  cover  up  beatings  and \nprevent exhaustion of grievances by inmates who have been beaten so \nthat they cannot maintain causes of action in court. \n41.\n  The  Defendant  CERT  Team  Officers  Powell,  Howell,  Brown, \nYancey, Cannon, Snake, Smith, Shane, Grainger, Radcliff, and Lt.

As Plaintiff \nwas boarding the van he placed his property bag on the front \nseat and moved to the back of the van. Then Defendant Byrd \nshouted out, โTake for mother f--king bag with you.โ Plaintiff \nthen came to retrieve his bag and told Defendant Byrd that he \ndid not want any trouble and that he just wanted to do his time \nand go home. Defendant Byrd then told the Plaintiff, โShut the \nfuck  up  and  take  your  mother  fucking  bag  with  you.โ  But \nbefore the Plaintiff could make contact with his bag Defendant \nByrd grabbed and pushed Plaintiff down and started beating \nand choking him. Plaintiff asked Defendant Byrd, โWhy are \nyou hitting me?โ Then Defendant Byrd snatched up the Plaintiff \nand threw him in another van where both Defendant Byrd and \nDefendant Osborne continued beating the Plaintiff while still in \nhandcuffs. \nDefendant Byrd then drove the van with the Plaintiff to \nRogers State Prison and on the way called on his radio a code \n10-18  meaning,  โofficer  under  attack.โ  Then  he  turned  and \nthreatened the Plaintiff, โWe are gonna beat your mother f--\nking ass.โ  Upon arrival at the back gate of Rogers State Prison \nanother officer, Defendant John Doe No. 1, came up to the van \nand asked, โWhatโs going on?โ to which Defendant Byrd told \nhim, โWe got a smart mother f--ker in here.โ Defendant John \nDoe No. 1 then stated, โLetโs show him what we do with smart \nmother f--kers.โ  \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 28 of 96\nBoth  Defendant  Byrd  and  Defendant  John  Doe  No.  1 \nthen took the Plaintiff still in handcuffs to a shakedown shack \nand both officers beat the Plaintiff with their fists and kicked \nhim repeatedly. In order to stop the beating, Plaintiff fainted a \nheart attack pulling out his nitro-quick heart pills which were \nproscribed  for  him  by  a  doctor  at  Costal  State  Prison.  The \nDefendants  Byrd  and  Doe  No.  1  then  stopped  beating  and \nkicking the Plaintiff and called medical. \nNurse Jane Doe No. 1 came to the shakedown shack with \nthree  other  nurses  with  a  golf  cart  joined  by  Defendants \nSergeant Burns and Sergeant Anderson. A nurse asked along \nwith  Defendant  Sergeant  Burns,  โWhatโs  his  problem?โ  to \nwhich Defendant Byrd replied, โThe mother f--ker claims it is \nhis heart or something.โ Then another nurse shouted, โThere is \nnothing in his chart that states he has heart problems.โ Then \nDefendant  Sergeant  Burns  asked,  โWhatโs  this  piece  of  sh-t \ndone?โ Officer Byrd replied, โThis mother f--ker is a smart ass, \nbut Iโll think of some more sh-t to put on him because we are \ngoing to beat his mother f--king ass.โ \nAt this point Defendant Deputy Warden Paul walked up \nand the Plaintiff tried to tell him that his officers were beating \nand kicking him. Defendant Deputy Warden Paul told Plaintiff, \nโShut  up,  I  donโt  want  to  hear  it.โ  And  he  walked  off. \nDefendant  Sergeant  Burns  leaned  over  and  stated  to  the \nPlaintiff, โWeโre gonna beat your ass. We canโt beat your ass \nnow because my warden is around. But weโre going to get cha.โ \nThen Defendant Sergeant Burns told John Doe No. 1, โTake \nthem cuffs from in front of him and cuff his hands behind his \nback because we gonna beat the sh-t out of him in just a little \nbit.โ\nPlaintiff was then taken to medical where Plaintiff told \nthe nurse that he hadnโt done anything to be beaten and the \nnurse replied, โWell, all I can tell you is this is how the they \n(CERT Team Officers) do you at Rogers State Prison.โ\n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 29 of 96\nWhile  in  medical  Defendant  Sergeant  Burns  in  the \npresence of the nurses announced, โWe are going to give you an \nass  cutting  you  wonโt  forget,  smart  mouth  mother  f--ker.โ \nPlaintiff replied, โSergeant, I didnโt to nothing.โ Sergeant Burns \nreplied, โThatโs what they (inmates) say before we beat their \nass.โ Plaintiff then asked Defendant Officer Byrd to say that he \ndid not do anything.

Plaintiff was severely beaten and kicked in \nevery part of his head and body until he thought he would die \nfrom the beating. The beating and kicking of the Plaintiff did \nnot  stop  until  Defendant  Sergeant  Anderson  told  Defendant \nSergeant Burns, โI think his head is bleading.โ Sergeant Burns \nleaned over and looked at the Plaintiffโs head and said, โNo, his \nhead  is  not  bleeding.  Just  make  sure  that  we  donโt  bust  his \nheadโ and then he slammed the Plaintiffโs head down on the \nshower floor. Then they all laughed at the Plaintiff. \nDefendant  Officer  Lewis  who  was  in  the  Dorm  then \ncame  up  and  said.  โDo  you  want  me  to  make  him  bleed \nSergeant?โ At this point Plaintiff made it to his feet and spitting \nup blood begged, โI am already bleeding.

Then \nDefendant Officer Lewis started punching the Plaintiff in his \nface and head repeatedly. Plaintiff lowered his head to avoid \ncontinuing to be beaten in his face and Defendant Officer Lewis \nhit him with an upper cut knocking him to the floor and out of \nthe shower. The Defendants again just laughed at the helpless \nPlaintiff.\nDefendant Officers Lewis and Byrd came over to where \nthe Plaintiff was laying on the floor and each spit in his face \nand  rubbed  the  spit  into  his  face  with  their  boots.  Then \nDefendant  Sergeant  Burns  leaned  over  and  put  his  finger  in \nPlaintiffโs face and said, โYouโre down south nigger, and we \nstill  run  sh-t  here,  boy.โ  Defendant  Sergeant  Burns  then  hit \nPlaintiff again in his nose and then asked again, โdo you hear \nme, boy.โ Plaintiff relied, โYes sir.โ  \nAt that point Officer John Doe Number Two came in the \nDorm  and  Defendant  Sergeant  Burns  told  Officer  John  Doe \nNumber  Two,  โHe  called  you  a  cracker.โ  Officer  John  Doe \nNumber One immediately came toward the Plaintiff with his \nfist clenched asking, โYou called me a cracker, boy, did you?โ \nPlaintiff tried to tell him that he did not โsay nothing.โ As soon \nas  John  Doe  Number  Two  reached  the  Plaintiff,  he  started \nkicking  and  boxing  him  in  his  face,  head  and  body.  After \nDefendant John Doe Number Two stopped beating and kicking \nthe Plaintiff, he said, โDonโt you never call me no cracker.โ \nDefendant Sergeant Burns then ordered the Plaintiff to \nget on his feet to take him back to medical, โGet up mother \nfucker. Get your sorry ass over here.โ Plaintiff struggled to his \nfeet, but because he was in a very weaken condition he fell back \ndown. Defendant again shouted, โGet up you piece of sh-t.โ \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 31 of 96\nPlaintiff  against  struggled  to  his  feet  with  his  hands  cuffed \nbehind his back.\nAs he was being led back to medical, Defendant Sergeant \nBurns stated, โDonโt worry, she (Jane Doe Number One) will \nput down what I will tell her to put down on paper.โ As the \nPlaintiff was sitting on the examination table in medical, he was \ntelling the nurse where he was hurt, but Defendant Sergeant \nBurns shouted, โShut the f--k upโ and told the nurse to, โPut \ndown time 10:15AM and write down something on his right \neyeโ which the nurse did exactly as she was told by Sergeant \nBurns.  Plaintiff  requested  some  pain  medication,  but  was \nrefused until he could see the doctor. \nPlaintiff was escorted to a solitary confinement lockdown \ncell in Dorm A-3 still in handcuffs where Defendant Sergeant \nBurns told Plaintiff before he took the handcuffs off, โWhen I \ntake  these  cuffs  off,  you  better  not  hit  me  and  if  you  say \nanything to the warden about us beating you, I promise you, \nyou  will  be  whipped  again.โ  Then  Sergeant  Burns  took  two \npictures  of  the  Plaintiff  without  cuffs  and  then  stated  to \nDefendant Byrd, โcome on Byrd, weโve gotta hook up some \npaperwork against this mother f--ker.โ \nThe next day on December 17, 2004 Plaintiff was taken \nback  to  medical  and  Defendants  used  a  video  camcorder  to \nrecord the Plaintiff coming to and leaving medical to make it \nlook like the previous day. \nOn  December  17,  2004  Defendant  Sergeant  Burns \ndemanded that Plaintiff write a statement denying the beating \nwhich  the  Plaintiff  refused.  Then  Defendant  Sergeant  Burns \nserved the Plaintiff with a Disciplinary Report (โDRโ) which \nwas totally falsified. The Plaintiff was ordered to serve thirty \ndays in solitary disciplinary confinement and 90 days store and \nphone restrictions and denied even calling a lawyer until after \nninety days. In further retaliation Plaintiff was taken to Georgia \nState Prison on January 4, 2005 and housed in the maximum \nsecurity prison. \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 32 of 96\nPlaintiff was severely beaten all over his body and his \nface was beaten and kicked extremely severely to the point that \nhis bloodied and swollen face was unrecognizable as a face and \nmultiple injuries over his body.  \n50.\nGregory B. Bryant v. Warden Glenn Rich, et al, Civil \nAction No. CV605-064- BAE. \nOn March 17, 2004, while on detail Y-5, Officer Love \ninstructed Plaintiff Bryant to cut grass with a lawnmower, and \nthe Plaintiff explained to Officer Love that he had a medical \nproblem  because  he  had  recently  been  stabbed  by  another \ninmate and could not push the lawnmower, but told her that he \ncould use the weed-eater or any of the other tools on the detail. \nBecause the Plaintiff could not push the lawnmower, Officer \nLove  took  the  Plaintiff  to  Building  A-4,  which  is  solitary \nconfinement,  and  was  overheard  by  the  Plaintiff  telling \nLieutenant Byrd, Sergeant Burns and Officer Byrd, โYaโll get \nhim.โ  \nLieutenant  Byrd  asked  the  Plaintiff,  โWhat  is  your \nproblem?โ  The  Plaintiff  responded  that  he  had  a  medical \nproblem because of recently being stabbed. When he lifted his \nshirt  to  show  his  the  wound,  at  Lieutenant  Byrdโs  request, \nLieutenant Byrd, without warning, hit him in the face. Officer \nByrd told the Plaintiff that if he bucked (fought back) that he \nwould beat the Plaintiff with the baton. Lieutenant Byrd and \nSergeant Burns then repeatedly beat and slapped him about his \nhead and body for 10 to 15 minutes while Officer Byrd held his \nbaton in his hand just waiting for the Plaintiff to fight back. \nPlaintiff fell to the floor and Defendants Lieutenant Byrd and \nSergeant Burns threatened to kick and stomp him if he didnโt \nget up. Once he got off the floor onto his feet, they continued to \nslap him a few more times, until his face was horribly swollen. \nThey told the Plaintiff to go cut the grass and instructed him to \npretend as if this never happened.\n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 33 of 96\nThat night of March 17, 2004 Plaintiff wrote a statement \nto Warden Rich stating that he was in fear of his life around the \nofficers who beat him and requested protective custody. At first \nhe was not put in protective custody. He stated that he wanted \nto call his family; then he was put in protective custody to keep \nhim  from  initially  reporting  the  beating  to  his  family.  The \nPlaintiff reported the beating to Deputy Warden Collins, who, \nalong with Lieutenant Byrd and other officers, threatened him \nstating, โIโll knock your gold teeth out, boy.โ Deputy Warden \nCollins then told Lieutenant Byrd that he โdidnโt have nothing \nto worry about.โ The Plaintiff was given a Disciplinary Report \n(โDRโ) on March 24, 2004 for initially refusing to come out of \nprotective custody because he was afraid for his life. \nOn  April  19,  2004  Plaintiff  Bryant  was  again  brutally \nbeaten, kicked, and repeatedly brutalized in his face and about \nhis  body  by  the  Defendants  Lieutenant  Byrd,  Officer  Byrd, \nOfficer Long, and Officer Register at the instigation of Officer \nLewis.\nOn April 19, 2004 while Plaintiff was in H-4 Dorm a \ncomment was made by another inmate about Officer Carswell \nwho is a female officer. About fifteen minutes later, Plaintiff \nwas called outside by unit manager Officer Lewis, who asked \nPlaintiff what he said to Officer Carswell. Plaintiff told Officer \nLewis that it wasnโt him who made the comment. Officer Lewis \ntold  Officer  Campbell  to  take  Plaintiff  to  A-3  segregation. \nPlaintiff heard Officer Lewis call Lieutenant Byrd on the radio \nto let him know the Plaintiff was coming.  \nUpon arrival at segregation, Officer Long, on the express \ninstructions of Lieutenant Byrd, locked the Plaintiff in a shower \nstall  until  Lieutenant  Byrd,  Officer  Byrd,  Officer  Long,  and \nOfficer Register came to the shower and unlocked the shower \ndoor and pulled him out. Lieutenant Byrd stated, โIโm getting \ntired  of  you  f--king  with  me  with  those  grievances.โ  The \nOfficers were wearing black gloves with padding on the outside \nof  the  knuckles,  especially  designed  for  hitting.  Then \nLieutenant Byrd hit the Plaintiff with his fist causing him to fall \nto  the  floor.  Lieutenant  Byrd,  Officer  Byrd,  and  Officer \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 34 of 96\nRegister kicked and stomped the Plaintiff in his back, side, and \nkidney  area  while  he  was  on  the  floor.  Officer  Long \ncommented, โThatโs good for his ass.โ Lieutenant Byrd, Officer \nByrd,  and  Officer  Register  continued  to  kick  and  stomp  the \nPlaintiff while he was on the floor for 5 to 10 minutes as the \nPlaintiff  begged  them  to  stop.  After  they  stopped  beating, \nkicking,  and  stomping  him,  Plaintiff  was  left  on  the  shower \nfloor crying and begging for medical attention. Officer Long \nlaughed and made fun of the Plaintiffโs crying and begging for \nmedical attention. Officer Long told Plaintiff that it he didnโt \nshut up he would call the officers who beat him to come back to \nbeat him some more. About ten minutes later Plaintiff heard \nOfficer  Long  on  the  phone  saying,  โHe  wants  some  more.โ \nLieutenant Byrd and Officer Byrd came back with Officer Long \nand said, โYou want some more.โ As Lieutenant Byrd began to \nunlock the shower door they were interrupted by two maintence \nworkers but stated, โWeโll be back.โ The Plaintiff stayed locked \nin the shower until shift change when another officer on the \nnext shift let him out and put him in a cell. \nThe Plaintiff was prevented from calling his family, but \nanother  inmate  who  was  an  orderly  was  able  to  call  the \nPlaintiffโs mother. Plaintiffโs mother was prevented from seeing \nthe  Plaintiff  because  of  his  swollen  face.  Plaintiffโs  mother \ncalled and talked to Warden Rich. Warden Rich then came to \nPlaintiffโs cell door and threatened the Plaintiff, โIf you want to \nsee Douglas, Georgia again, you better learn to keep your big \nmouth  closed.โ  The  Plaintiff  then  really  feared  for  his  life \nbecause Warden Rich had threatened doing something physical \nto him. \nAs a result of the beatings, Plaintiff has suffered severe \nphysical injury and mental injury, inability to sleep, depression, \nand even contemplated suicide because of the hopelessness of \nhis requests for help being ignored by Wardens, counselors, and \ninternal affairs. The Plaintiff has been traumatized and suffers \nfrom post traumatic syndrome. \n51.\n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 35 of 96\nRandy Thomas Hooks v. Warden Glenn Rich, et., al.,\nCivil Action No. CV605-065- BAE. \nOn October 11, 2003 following an argument with two \nother inmates in Dorm H-2 which had been settled between \nthem, Plaintiff Hooks was told by Officer McIntyre to report to \nDefendant  Lieutenant  Langston.  Plaintiff  asked  Lieutenant \nLangston  why  he  had  been  singled  out  and  the  other  two \ninmates  were  still  watching  the  football  game.  Lieutenant \nLangston became very angry and told the Plaintiff to put his \nhands behind his back, although they were already behind his \nback the whole time he was speaking to Lieutenant Langston. \nLieutenant Langston then handcuffed Plaintiffโs hands behind \nhis back and Langston pushed the Plaintiffโs face up against a \nbrick column by central control and put extreme pressure on the \nPlaintiffโs left hand, which has a metal band in it that holds his \nmiddle bone together. The Plaintiff asked Lieutenant Langston \nto change the pressure he was applying from his left hand to his \nright hand, but he did not; he continued to put extreme pressure \non the hand with the metal band in the bone. \nDefendant Lieutenant Langston shoved the Plaintiff into \na shower stall and pulled the curtain so that the other officers \ncould not see into the shower stall. He pushed the Plaintiffโs \nhead into the corner and said, โIโm pissed the f--k off.โ Then he \nhit the Plaintiff 3 or 4 four times in the back of his head and \nsaid, โNow Iโm going to put my foot in your ass.โ He then \nbrutally kicked the Plaintiff in the leg. The Plaintiff was really \nscared and repeatedly said that he did not want any trouble and \nsaid  to  Lieutenant  Langston,  โOk,  I  am  stupid.โ  Since \nLieutenant  Langston  had  said  this  earlier,  the  Plaintiff  was \ntrying  to  cooperate  so  Langston  would  stop  the  attack. \nLieutenant Langston, totally out of control, continued to attack \nthe Plaintiff while his hands were still handcuffed behind his \nback hitting him two more times on the right side of his back \njust  above  the  waist.  Lieutenant  Langston  then  ordered  the \nPlaintiff to strip off all his clothes and then Lieutenant Langston \nclosely inspected the Plaintiffโs naked body. \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 36 of 96\nAs a result of the beatings Plaintiff has suffered severe \nphysical  injury  and  mental  injury,  including  blackouts  and \nsevere  headaches,  and  suffered  nerve  damage  to  his  foot \ncausing his foot to become numb and drop requiring that he \nwear a brace on his foot. \n52.\nMichael K.

Jamison.  Defendant \nLangston grabbed the Plaintiff who was already in handcuffs \nand pulled him into the center of the room. Defendant Langston \nthen  stood  in  front  of  the  Plaintiff  and  without  warning  or \nprovocation Defendant Langston hit Plaintiff on his chin with \nhis  elbow.  Then  Defendant  Langston  hit  the  Plaintiff  again \nmoving his whole body backwards, snapping back his head, \nhitting  the  wall  so  that  he  started  to  black  out.  Defendant \nLangston slapped him back to consciousness and then told him, \nโShut the fuck up, punk or Iโm going to kill youโ and โYou \nainโt no boโhog.โ He continued hitting and slapping the Plaintiff \nin  his  face.  After  he  had  beaten  the  Plaintiff,  Defendant \nLangston then snatched the Plaintiff off the wall and took him \nby the handcuff chain  into the hallway of F-2-4 where he again \nslammed  the  Plaintiffโs  head  against  the  wall  and  held  the \nPlaintiff by the throat, just looking at the Plaintiff and told the \nPlaintiff not to say a word. \nPlaintiff  was  escorted  to  medical  where  Defendant \nLangston  continued  to  assault  him  in  a  room  adjacent  to \nmedical while he was handcuffed and pushed down in a chair \nhitting and slapping him about his head and face  while wearing  \nblack gloves with padding on the outside of the knuckles that \nare  specially  designed  for  hitting.

Defendant Langston \nthen put on his black gloves which are padded on the outside of \nthe knuckles, especially designed for hitting and stated, โYou \nthink you run my chain gang.โ He then beat the Plaintiff with \nhis  fists  with  multiple  blows  about  his  face  and  body  until \nOfficer  Cardell  came  in  and  asked,  โWhatโs  going  on.โ \nDefendant Langston then gave the Plaintiff one last kick in his \nstomach.  Defendant  Langston  threw  a  Disciplinary  Report \n(โDRโ) at the Plaintiff who was still handcuffed in the shower. \nOn November 18, 2003 at around 6:15AM as Plaintiff \nwas proceeding from his dorm building to the gym in order to \nreceive  a  clipper  shave  when  he  was  stopped  by  Defendant \nLangston who asked him where he was going. The Plaintiff \nreplied that he was going to get a clipper shave according to his \nproscribed medical profile. Defendant Langston then told the \nPlaintiff, โGet your punk ass up against the fenceโ where he \nhandcuffed the Plaintiffโs hands behind his back and dragged \nhim  to  lockdown.    Upon  arrival  at  the  lockdown  unit, \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 38 of 96\nDefendant Langston shoved the Plaintiff into a shower stall, put \non his black gloves, especially designed for hitting, and beat the \nPlaintiff  hitting  him  in  his  face  and  lower  body.  Defendant \nLangston continued kicking the Plaintiff even after the Plaintiff \nfell to the floor.

He told the Plaintiff to put his clothes back on and stated, \nโYou arenโt my type.โ  \nPlaintiff  returned  to  his  dorm  bleeding  from  his  nose, \nbruised,  and  swollen  about  his  mouth  and  face.  The  dorm \nofficer, Ms. Ryan, asked if he wanted go to medical but needed \nto  talk  to  Defendant  Lieutenant  Langston  first  who  was  in \ncharge of the shift. Defendant Langston told her to send him up \nand  while  the  Plaintiff  was  proceeding  to  medical  he  was \nstopped by Defendant Langston. Defendant Langston told him, \nโYou think you are sick donโt you?

Defendant  John  Doe  then \nfollowed the Plaintiff and got right in his face saying you donโt \nknow who I am while spitting in the Plaintiffโs face and eyes. \nPlaintiff  told  him  to  back  up  and  stop  spitting  in  his  face. \nDefendant John Doe then radioed the CERT Team, who put the \nPlaintiff in handcuffs and took him to lockdown where he was \nplaced in a shower stall still in handcuffs for quite some time.  \nThe Defendant John Doe Unit Manager then opened the shower \ndoor and without warning punched the Plaintiff in his stomach, \ncausing him to fall to the ground. Then Defendant John Doe \nstomped the Plaintiff three or four times and told him never to \ndisrespect him again. \nIn  October,  2003  Plaintiff  was  having  psychological \nproblems and the prison psychiatrist upgraded his mental level \nto level 3 so officers, along with Lieutenant McCloud, were \ncalled  to  escort  the  Plaintiff  to  A-Unit  Special  Management \nUnit where Plaintiffโs handcuffs were removed and he was left \nin  a  cell  for  a  few  minutes.  The  Officers  then  returned  and \nplaced  the  Plaintiff  back  in  handcuffs  behind  his  back. \nDefendant Sergeant Byrd pushed the Plaintiff to the ground and \nkicked the Plaintiff several times while Defendant Lieutenant \nMcCloud and other officers watched. The Plaintiff was then \ntaken to the Georgia State Prison as a sleeper where his family \nwould not be able to see the obvious results of the beating and \nto give time for his wounds to heal before anyone at Rogers \nState Prison could see his beaten face and body. \nA morning in October, 2003 Plaintiff declined to take \nproscribed medicine and was told by the officer to report to \nmedical and sign a medicine refusal.

When the \nPlaintiff voiced his displeasure with the proceedings Defendant \nLieutenant  Langston  ordered  him  to  be  taken  to  lock  down. \nPlaintiff passed Deputy Warden Collins and asked if he could \nspeak  to  him;  Defendant  Collins  just  ignored  the  Plaintiffโs \npleas.  After  a  few  hours  in  a  cell  in  lockdown,  Defendant \nLieutenant Langston came to his cell and ordered the officer to \nput  handcuffs  on  the  Plaintiff  behind  his  back.  Defendant \nLieutenant Langston then put on his black gloves with padded \nknuckles and especially designed for hitting and hit the Plaintiff \nmultiple times in his face and stomach causing him to fall back \ninto the wall where he continued to kick and punch the Plaintiff \nseveral more times.

The autopsy found that \nClarke III died of cardiac arrest when a blood clot in his leg \nmoved to block his pulmonary artery and also found that some \nbruises on Clarke III, including a roughly 10- by 4-inch bruise \non his thigh. Prior to February 17, 2005, Plaintiffโs son Clarke \nIII was severely beaten by the Defendants Capt. Goodrum, Lt. \nGoodrum,  Sgt.  Daniels,  Sgt.  Smith,  Officer  Haire,  and  John \nDoes  resulting  in  visible  bruises,  contusions,  swelling,  and \nvisible evidence of he had been beaten.    \nOn February 17, 2005, Clarke III was denied transport \nfrom Jackson for a court-ordered appearance in front of Judge \nHugh  Stone  in  the  Superior  Court  of  Union  County  for  a \nhearing. Defendant Dr. Cowart as a cover up for the beatings of \nClarke III claimed that the Clarke III was mentally unstable and \ncould not be released to attend the scheduled Court hearing for \nFebruary 22, 2005. Clarke III had been placed in the Special \nManagement Unit (SMU) and that Defendant Schofield would \nnot  allow  Clarke  III  out  of  the  his  unit  or  to  attend  the \nscheduled  hearing  as  a  cover  up  for  Defendants  beatings  of \nClarke III.\nOn March 18, 2005, Clarke III was severely beaten again \nby the Defendants Capt.

Defendants were warned by a nurse that placing \nClark  III  in  restraint  for  an  extended  length  of  time  after  a \nbeating could likely cause him to form blood clots that could be \nfatal.  Defendants  ignored  the  warning  from  the  nurse  and \ncontinued the Clark III in extended five point restrain that was a \nproximate  cause  of  his  death.

Defendant Dozier had realized that the Plaintiff has \nseen this inappropriate sexual activity with the female inmate \nand chased after the Plaintiff, ordered her to stop, and yelled at \nher if she had anything to say. Plaintiff answered โNo Sirโ to \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 75 of 96\nwhich Defendant Dozier roughly replied, โGood, keep it that \nway.โ  Approximately  a  week  later,  Defendant  Dozier  pulled \nPlaintiff out of the chow line off a sidewalk, grabbing her arm, \nand told her that she had seen too much and said, โYouโd better \nmind your own business.โ Several times thereafter Defendant \nDozier came by Plaintiffโs cell and would just stare at her for a \nlong period each time. \nOn  or  about  March  23,  2005  after  the  Plaintiff  had \nfinished  her  detail  working  in  the  Prison  Industries  building \nwhile she was sweeping up a side room in a stall separated by \ncurtains where inmates are searched, Defendant Dozier came up \nbehind her, grabbed her hair, and  snatched out her barrette \nholding  up  her  hair,  and  pulled  her  hair  down.  He  reached \naround and grabbed her blouse to unbutton it. Plaintiff pulled \naway and said. โWhat are you doing?โ He reached for her hair \nagain and said, โYou must be a whore, because only whores \nhave hair this color.โ Plaintiffโs hair color was a bleached blond \nat the time. Dozier then reached for her blouse again and put his \nhands on her breasts. Plaintiff told him to stop and pushed his \nhands away. Suddenly, Dozier punched her as hard as her could \nwith a closed fist in her right breast knocking the breath out of \nher and causing her to lose her balance. He then ripped her shirt \nall the way open and started fondling and pinching her breasts. \nHe was all over her and pulled her pants as well as her panties \ndown at the same time. He knocked her down to the floor and \npulled her pants off one leg, pulled her panties to one side, and \npulled off one of her boots.\nPlaintiff was screaming for help while resisting by trying \nto push him off and trying to fight him off. He yelled at her, \nโShut  up,  Bitchโ  and  repeatedly  kicked  her  with  his  CERT \nTeam combat boots which really hurt and severely bruising her \nin her leg, kicked her all up her right side, and kicked her in her \nribs which she heard and felt breaking from his kicks. At this \npoint Dozier unzipped his pants and pulled out his erect penis, \nstroking it, and started masturbating. Plaintiff tried to kick him \nin the groin with her left leg which still had on a boot. He \npunched her with his fist on the left side of her head causing a \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 76 of 96\nsevere bruise and knot above her left eye and kept punching \nPlaintiff all over raising multiple bruises. \nPlaintiff  continued  screaming,  crying,  and  prying  out \nloud  for  help.  Defendant  Dozier  yelled  at  her  to,  โShut  up, \nbecause nobody was going to help you.โ Then Dozier grabbed \nthe  broom  with  which  the  Plaintiff  had  been  sweeping  and \nvigorously beat her with the broom handle multiple blows all \nthe way up and down her right side. Defendant Dozier then \npushed the Plaintiff over onto her stomach and tried to get on \ntop her while she was trying to resist by squirming the best that \nshe could while he was holding her down with his body. He \nused  the  broom  handle  to  pry  her  legs  apart.  She  continued \ncrying and screaming. He said, โShut up,โ โYou deserve this,โ \nand โYouโre going to like it.โ \nDozier  took  the  broom  handle  and  tried  to  prod  her \nrectum. Finally he jammed the broom handle up in her rectum \ncausing terrific pain. She could feel it ripping her rectum and \nhurting  so  bad.  She  couldnโt  even  hear  for  a  few  seconds \nbecause of the blinding pain. Dozier then said, โHow do you \nlike that?โ She was begging him to stop but he kept pushing the \nbroom handle up in her rectum several more times. Then she \nfelt his erect penis pushing on her butt cheek. During this time \nDozier told Plaintiff, โIโll teach you to see too much.โ \nThere was a noise in an adjacent room where her yelling \nand  pleading  had  to  have  been  heard.  Dozier  called  out \nsomebodyโs name that the Plaintiff could not understand and \nsaid,  โIs  that  you?โ  Dozier  then  got  up  off  of  her.  Plaintiff \nstruggled to get up and realized there was blood between her \nlegs,  she  had  bruises  all  over  her  body,  and  her  ribs  and \nstomach were hurting real bad. As Plaintiff was getting up and \ntrying  to  get  her  clothes  back  on,  Dozier  screamed  at  her, \nโWhore, you better not try to say anything to anybody or Iโll \nthrow  you  in  lockdown  and  you  wonโt  be  able  to  talk  to \nanybody after that. Iโll make sure of it. And Iโll will get you and \nfix you again.โ Then suddenly he left. \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 77 of 96\nPlaintiff struggled to get her clothes and pulled up her \npanties dripping with blood from her rectum. Terrified she went \nback to her dorm and lay in her cell not knowing what to do, \nhurting with bruises all over her body, arms and legs with huge \nknots above her right breast and where he hit her above her left \neye,  and  in  constant  pain  in  her  ribs  and  rectum  which \ncontinued to profuse blood. \nPlaintiff  did  not  tell  anyone  and  wore  a  sweat  shirt \nunderneath her uniform to cover her bruises. Several days later \nan inmate friend, Paula Whitner, saw the bruises on her arm and \nasked her what had happened. All Plaintiff could do was to cry \nand show her the other bruises on her body. She encouraged \nPlaintiff to tell somebody about the attack, but Plaintiff was \nafraid that she would be attacked again by Defendant Rozier. \nFinally  Plaintiff  told  her  husband  who  called  the  Southern \nCenter for Human Rights who sent an attorney, Sydney Kelley, \nto interview her who saw the bruises all over her body and that \nshe  was  still  bleeding  from  her  rectum.  Plaintiff  told  the \nattorney that she was terrified that she would be attacked again \nattacked  again  if  she  told  anybody  about  the  attack  and  the \nattacker. The attorney advised her that she could not guarantee \nthat it would not happen again, so Plaintiff continued to be too \nterrified to tell the authorities. \nHer husband contracted another attorney, James Hogan, \nwho  made  some  calls  to  the  Defendant  Warden  Hickman. \nDefendant Warden Hickman then called Plaintiff to his office \nwhere Plaintiff told him that she had been beaten and sexually \nattacked and that she wanted to go to a hospital as well as to go \nsomewhere  else.  Nurse  Rogers  was  called  to  the  Wardenโs \noffice and was shown the bruises on the Plaintiffโs arms and \nthen  she  took  Plaintiff  to  the  emergency  room  at  Taylor \nRegional  Hospital.  The  emergency  room  doctor  examined \nPlaintiff, took e-rays, and gave plaintiff a rectal examination. \nThe  emergency  room  doctor  took  pictures  of  her  body  and \ndiagnosed that she had two broken ribs and tears in her rectum, \nbut  that  she  could  not  see  the  full  extent  because  of  the \ncontinual  bleeding.

Plaintiff Murphy \nhad been sent by Officer Alexander to the barber shop in order \nto continue to work in the kitchen. Plaintiff took off his plastic \napron which is worn in lieu of the outer prison shirts in the \nkitchen  and  preceded  to  the  barbershop.  Defendant  Johns \nstopped the Plaintiff on a sidewalk as he was proceeding to the \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 79 of 96\nbarbershop and asked him why he was not wearing his outer \nprison shirt. Plaintiff told Defendant Johns that he had been sent \nto the barbershop by a kitchen officer just as he was dressed in \nthe kitchen. Without warning Defendant Johns reached for his \nhandcuffs and Plaintiffโs hand and without warning proceeded \nto beat the Plaintiff to unconsciousness.  \nPlaintiff was severely beaten by Defendant Johns who \ncontinued to beat the Plaintiff even after he lost consciousness \nin his face, head, and body for a substantial period until other \nofficers had to intercede to stop Defendant Johns. The beating \nresulted in severe injuries to the Plaintiff including suffering a \nbroken  eye  socket  bone  and  fractured  shoulder  as  well  as \nlacerations and bruises to his head and face that were bleeding \nprofusely and required  multiple stitches. The injuries were so \nsevere  that  Plaintiff  had  to  be  taken  to  an  outside  hospital \nemergency room for emergency treatment for his injuries and \nthen Plaintiff had to be transferred to the prison hospital at the \nMedical College of Georgia in Augusta requiring an extended \nperiod of time in the prison hospital. He continues to complain \nof headaches and the effects of his beating because the attack \nfractured his right eye socket and fractured shoulder.

When the Plaintiff arrived the unit manager was not in \nhis  office.  Defendant  Hatcher  was  there  and  shut  the  door. \nDefendant Hatcher said to the Plaintiff, โthis is your chance to \nfight  me.โ  Plaintiff  did  not  say  or  do  anything,  but  turned \naround to wall out the door. Then Defendant Hatcher called 10-\n18 [assault on an officer] on his radio and attacked the Plaintiff \nfrom  behind  without  warning  hitting  him  in  the  back  of  his \nhead.\nImmediately  thereafter  the  Defendant  Officers  of  the \nCERT  Team  appeared  and  beat,  kicked,  and  clubbed  the \nPlaintiff  multiple  times  in  his  face  and  about  his  head  with \nmetal flashlights taking turns for over ten minutes while he was \nlying  helpless  on  the  floor.  The  immediate  entry  of  the \nDefendant  Corrections  Officers  of  the  CERT  Team  was \npreplanned  to  be  coordinated  so  that  the  CERT  Team \nCorrections Officers had already come from the main prison \nfacility  to  the  Annex  to  be  in  position  at  the  Dorm  door  to \nimmediately attack the Plaintiff within a very few seconds after \nDefendant Hatcher gave the signal of 10-18 on his radio. \nPlaintiff was severely beaten all over his body and his \nface was beaten and clubbed extremely severely to the point \nthat his bloodied and swallow face was almost unrecognizable \nas a face. The beating continued for over ten minutes to punish \nthe  Plaintiff  with  all  six  Corrections  Officers  taking  turns \nbeating, kicking and clubbing the Plaintiff with no attempt to \nput the Plaintiff in restraint. After Defendant Hatcher decided \nthat  the  Plaintiff  has  had  enough  of  punishment  from  the \nbeating the Defendant Corrections Officers of the CERT Team \nwere stopped. In violation of procedures there was no video \ncamera present to record the beating of the Plaintiff. \nPlaintiff was taken to medical for treatment of his injuries \nwhich  included  severe  head  and  facial  injuries  that  he  had \nreceived  from  the  beating  and  repeated  clubbing  with  metal \nflashlights.

Tony Henderson, et al, Civil Action \nNo. 1:07-CV-2369-TCB \nOn March 21, 2007 where Plaintiff Graham, who is a \nLevel IV mental health inmate, was being housed in the special \nhandling mental health dorm at Phillips State Prison, Officer \nSahirah Muhammad was escorting him from the shower with \nonly one officer when two escorting officers are required for \nhandling  this  level  mental  health  inmate  and  with  his  hands \nhandcuffed  in  front  when  the  Standard  Operating  Procedure \nrequires that his hands are to be handcuffed behind his back. He \nstruck Officer Muhammad with his handcuffed hands after a \nvoice from Jesus told him to do it. Office Muhammad lied and \nsaid that he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back, but \nthat he somehow got his hands in front of him while she was \nhands  on  escorting  him  which  is  impossible.  Officer \nMuhammad had been taunting him for several previous weeks. \nOfficer Muhammad should have had mental health training but \nhad not yet taken the special mental health training. \n  Officer  Muhammad  was  struck  because  of  a \nserious  breach  of  Standard  Operating  Procedure  by  a  very \nseverely  mental  ill  inmate,  but  also  because  he  suffered  an \nirresistible  impulse  and  at  the  time  was  under  involuntary \nintoxication because of the refusal of the prison to give him \nZyprexa.  The  prison  would  not  proscribe  Zyprexa  or  other \ngeneric equivalents because of its expense. The other medicines \nthat had been prescribed by the prison doctors had been tried \nand failed to stabilize him as well as having major adverse side \neffects. He finally refused the substituted medicines. Without \nthe  Zyprexa,  Plaintiff  was  powerless  to  resist  his  imagined \nvoice from Jesus and hitting the officer with the handcuffs that \nwere improperly only restraining his hands in front of him. \n  Thereafter on March 21, 2007 Plaintiff was then \nseverely  beaten  by  the  Defendant  supervisors  Lt.  Byrd,  Lt. \nBowman, and Defendant Officers Williams, Foster, MacKlin, \nMcCord, Philbert, and Carr four times over a period of hours \nwhile restrained in handcuffs including a brutal beating while in \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 82 of 96\nthe medical facility at Phillips State Prison. The beatings caused \nhim  severe  physical  and  mental  trauma  being  beaten  with \nmultiple blows, kicks, and stomping to his face head and body. \nThe  beatings  were  so  serve  that  he  had  to  be  taken  in \nemergency to Atlanta Medical Center and was in intensive care \nfor  ten  days  with  a  collapsed  lung  from  the  summary \npunishment beatings.  \nThe pattern and practice at Phillips State Prison and at \nother Georgia prisons is that if an inmate touches an officer that \nthey  will  receive  severe  physical  beatings  as  summary \npunishment which was condoned by and to which Defendants \nHenderson  and  Deputy  Warden  Nervo  were  deliberately \nindifferent  to  the  pattern  and  practice  of  beating  restrained \ninmates as summary punishment. \nHayes State Prison โ\n91.\nThomas E. Clark v. Steve Upton, et al., Civil Action No. \n4:05-CV-00210-HLM.\nOn October 20th, 2003 around 6:35 PM while Plaintiff \nClark was on kitchen duty at Hayes State Prison, Defendant \nCook called two CERT Team Officers, Defendant Thompson \nand  Defendant  Helms  to  the  kitchen.  Plaintiff  and  another \ninmate were called by Defendant Thompson to go to the office. \nDefendant Thomson said โyou two refused to turn back on the \ntray machineโ which was not true. \nAs  Plaintiff  was  talking  to  Defendant  Thompson \nexplaining that the kitchen staff went through inspection of the \nkitchen and ordered them to leave, Defendant Cook put two \ntrays in the sink. Plaintiff noticed Defendant Helms handcuffing \nanother inmate, Defendant Thompson then asked Plaintiff to \nstep outside of the office. Defendant Thompson came behind \nPlaintiff and said, โWhatโs going beโ. So Plaintiff put his hand \nbehind his back, Defendant Thompson handcuffed Plaintiff and \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 83 of 96\nviolently then threw him on the floor face down first causing \nhim  to  fall  and  hit  his  face  on  concrete  floor.  Plaintiff  was \ninjured and his face was swelling up. Defendants Thompson \nand Helms, snatched Plaintiff up and rushed him to the medical \ndepartment,  where  Plaintiff  was  thrown  on  a  bed,  twisting \nPlaintiffโs hand with great pressure to cause intense pain to the \nPlaintiff. Defendants Thompson and Helms handcuffed Plaintiff \nextremely  tightly  to  a  bed  pole,  and  Defendant  Thompson \npunched Plaintiff in his side then pressed his thumb with great \npressure behind Plaintiffโs left. Lt. Norton came in and asked \nDefendants Thompson and Helms to leave. Lt. Norton stated to \nPlaintiff โI am going to remove the handcuff from the pole and \nhandcuff  you  in  the  front.โ  Defendant  Thompson  had \nhandcuffed the Plaintiff very tightly causing Plaintiff to bleed \nand Lt. Norton called in the nurse after observing the blood \naround Plaintiffโs wrist, ribs and behind Plaintiff left ear.  \nPlaintiff was removed from the Medical Department by \nsix officers and then subjected to the torture of the โGeorgia \nMotorcycleโ  by  being  stripped  down  completely  naked  and \nstrapped down to iron bed.  Plaintiff was strapped down to iron \nbed for approximately twenty-four hours and a football helmet \nwas put on his head to prevent him from banding his unstrained \nhead. The next morning on October 21st 2003, Plaintiffโs cell \nwas unlocked. Defendant Hatcher walked in to Plaintiffโs cell \nwith two CERT. Defendants and stated โthis is the bad assโ and \nDefendant Hatcher punched Plaintiff in his chin and his right \neye.  As  the  blood  started  running  down  Plaintiffโs  face, \nDefendant Hatcher stated โWelcome to SMUโ then left. \nLIABILITY OF DEFENDANTS\n92.\n  The Defendants Warden Hart and Deputy Warden McLaughlin who \nare directly responsible for the security and well being of inmates at the \nValdosta State Prison have condoned and have been deliberately indifferent \n\nCase 7:08-tc-05000     Document 2      Filed 01/08/2008     Page 84 of 96\nand are continuing to condone and be deliberately indifferent to the beatings \nof  restrained  inmates  at  Valdosta  State  Prison  by  CERT  Team  Officers \nwhich is a past and continuing  pattern and practice of beating inmates by \nCERT  Team  Officers  and  Captain  Morris  and  Lt.

HASKELL JR.,  Civil Action 7:08-CV-5 (HL) \n   \nPlaintiffs,   \n \nv. \n \nLIEUTENANT SHERMAN MAINE,  \nOFFICER JAMIE POWERS,  \nOFFICER JESSE HOWELL,  \nOFFICER TERRY BROWN,  \nOFFICER ANDRE YANCEY,  \nOFFICER JOSEPH SCHNAKE,  \nOFFICER RODNEY SMITH,  \nOFFICER WILLIE RATLIFF, and  \nLIEUTENANT DOUGLASS RIDALL, \n \n                    Defendants. \n \n  ORDER \n  This case is before the Court on a number of motions and recommendations. \nThe Court will address each one separately below. \nI.  Defendant  Rodney  Smithโs Motion for Summary   Judgment (Doc. \n127)/Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Langstaff (Doc. 153) \n \n  Magistrate Judge Thomas Q. Langstaff has recommended that the Motion for \nSummary Judgment (Doc. 127) filed by Defendant Rodney Smith be denied. Plaintiff \nHeng contends that Defendant Smith used excessive force against him in violation of \nhis Eighth Amendment Rights. Defendant Smith has filed an objection to the \n\nRecommendation. The Court has made a de novo review of the Recommendation. \nThe only objection that merits further discussion relates to qualified immunity. \n  The Court does not read the Recommendaiton to mean that qualified immunity \nwas denied to Defendant Smith because qualified immunity is never available in an \nexcessive force case, which is what Defendant Smith argues in his objection. The \nCourt reads the Recommendation to mean that qualified immunity is not available \nunder the facts of this particular case, and the Court agrees.  \n  โQualified immunity shields federal and state officials from money damages \nunless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or \nconstitutional right, and (2) that the right was clearly established at the time of the \nchallenged conduct.โ Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, --- U.S. ---, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2080 (2011) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). The court may address these prongs in either \norder. Id.  \n  The Eighth Amendment governs prison officialsโ use of force against inmates \nand prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. Whitley v. Albers, 475 \nU.S. 312, 327, 106 S.Ct. 1078 (1986). In determining whether a prison officialโs use \nof force was excessive, the court must  examine โwhether force was applied in a \ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to \ncause harm.โ Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995 (1992). Relevant \nfactors include โthe need for the application of force, the relationship between the \n \n2 \n \n\nneed and the amount of force that was used, and the extent of injury inflicted.โ \nWhitley, 475 U.S. at 321 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  To  overcome a qualified immunity defense at summary judgment, the \nevidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, must โmake out a \nviolation of a constitutional right,โ and โthe right at issue [must have been] โclearly \nestablishedโ at the time of defendantโs alleged misconduct.โ Pearson v. Callahan, \n555  U.S. 223, 232, 129 S.Ct. 808 (2009). The use of force maliciously and \nsadistically to cause harm has been clearly  established to be a violation of the \nConstitution. See Skrtich v. Thornton, 280 F.3d 1295, 1301 (11th Cir. 2002). Thus, \nthe question is whether Plaintiff Heng showed a violation of his Eighth Amendment \nrights. As detailed in Judge Langstaffโs Recommendation, viewing the facts in the \nlight most favorable to Plaintiff Heng, t here is a question of fact as to whether \nDefendant Smith violated Plaintiffโs constitutional rights. This means that Defendant \nSmith is not entitled to qualified immuni ty on the excessive force claim at the \nsummary  judgment stage of the case. Thus, Defendant Smithโs objection is \noverruled.1 \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 While Plaintiffs included the Recommendation  filed at Document 153 in their omnibus \nobjection to the Recommendations, the Court assumes inclusion of Document 153 was in \nerror as Judge Langstaff found in favor of Plaintiff Heng in that Recommendation.   \n \n3 \n \n\nII.  Defendant  Willie Ratliffโs Motion for Summary   Judgment (Doc. \n131)/Recommendations of Magistrate Judge Langstaff (Docs. 154) \n \n  Judge Langstaff has recommended that the Motion for Summary Judgment \n(Doc. 131) filed by Defendant Willie Ratliff as to Plaintiff Walkerโs claims be granted. \nPlaintiff Walker has filed an objection to the Recommendation. The Court has made \na de novo review of the Recommendation.  \n  The question before the Court is whether Plaintiff Walkerโs excessive force \nclaim is barred by Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (1994). The \nUnited States Supreme Court held in Heck that: \n[I]n  order to recover damages for allegedly \nunconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other \nharm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render \na conviction or sentence invalid, a ยง 1983 plaintiff must \nprove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed \non direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared \ninvalid  by a state tribunal authorized to make such \ndetermination, or called into question by a federal courtโs \nissuance of a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254. A \nclaim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction \nor  sentence that has  not  been so invalidated is not \ncognizable under ยง 1983. \n \nId. at 486-87 (emphasis in original). \n  Plaintiff Walker alleges that on May 14, 2007, Defendant Ratliff and others \nassaulted him without provocation and continued to beat him after he was placed in \nhandcuffs. Defendant Ratliff contends Plaintiff Walker instigated the confrontation by \nstriking an officer in the face. Plaintiff Walker was eventually convicted of two counts \n \n4 \n \n\nof felony obstruction of a correctional o fficer arising out of the events on May 14, \n2007. \n  Plaintiff Walker was convicted under O.C.G.A. ยง 16-10-24(b), which provides: \nWhoever  knowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or \nopposes  any law enforcement officer, prison guard, \ncorrectional  officer, probation supervisor, parole \nsupervisor, or conservation ranger in the lawful discharge \nof his official duties by offering or doing violence to the \nperson of such officer or el gally authorized person is guilty \nof a felony and shall, uponc onviction thereof, be punished \nby imprisonment for not less than one nor more than five \nyears. \n \nO.C.G.A. ยง 16-10-24(b).  \n \n  Judge Langstaff was correct that Plaintfif Walkerโs claims are barred by Heck. \nAllowing Plaintiff Walker to prove his version of the events of May 14, 2007 would \ndirectly undermine his conviction for obstructing a correctional officer, and are \ntherefore Heck-barred.2 Plaintiff Walkerโs objection is overruled. \nIII.  Defendants Maine, Howell, Brown, Ridall, Yancey, and Schnakeโs Motion \n  for Summary Judgment (Doc. 133)/Recommendation of Magistrate Judge \n  Thomas Q. Langstaff (Doc. 155) \n \n  Judge Langstaff has recommended that summary judgment be granted in \nDefendants Maine, Howell, and Brownโs favor on Plaintiff Walkerโs claims against \nthem. He has also recommended that summary judgment be granted in Defendant \n                                                 \n2 The Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffsโ res judicata and collateral \nestoppel arguments contained in the objection are inapposite, as neither of those \n \n5 \n \n\nMaineโs favor on Plaintiff Hengโs and Plaintiff Askewโs claims against him. Finally, \nJudge Langstaff recommends that Defendant Ridallโs summary judgment motion as \nto Plaintiff Haskellโs claims be denied.  \n  Plaintiffs  have filed an objection to the two recommendations to grant \nsummary judgment. Defendant Ridall has filed an objection to the recommendation \nto deny his summary judgment motion. The Court has made ad e novo review of the \nRecommendation and will address each objection separately. \n  First, as discussed above, Plaintiff Walkerโs claims are barred by Heck v. \nHumphrey. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of Defendants Maine, Howell, and \nBrown is appropriate as to Plaintiff Walkerโs claims against them. \n  Second, the Court agrees with Judge Langstaff that summary judgment in \nDefendant Maineโs favor is appropriate on Plaintiff Hengโs and Plaintiff Askewโs \nclaims against him. Plaintiffs have in no way established any supervisory liability on \nthe part of Defendant Maine. \n  This leaves Judge Langstaffโs recommendation to deny summary judgment to \nDefendant Ridall. The remaining claim against Defendant Ridall is alleged by Plaintiff \nHaskell, who contends Defendant Ridall used excessive force against him on March \n5, 2008 at Valdosta State Prison. In support of his summary judgment motion, \nDefendant Ridall submitted a videotape that depicts the events immediately following \n                                                                                                                                                             \ndefenses were ever raised. The Court disagrees with Plaintiffsโ contention that Heck \n \n6 \n \n\nthe alleged use of force incident on March 5, 2008. Defendant Ridall contends that \nthe videotape contradicts Plaintiff Haskellโs version of the events, and therefore \nPlaintiff Haskellโs account of the events must be rejected.  \n  Plaintiff Haskellโs version of the events is as follows. After he reported an \nalleged theft, Defendant Ridall and two other officers came to his dorm. The officers \nwrestled Plaintiff Haskell to the ground, put handcuffs on him, and escorted him from \nthe dorm. After leaving the dorm, the officers pushed Plaintiff Haskell face down on \nthe sidewalk. The fall caused Plaintiff Haskellโs lip to burst open and bleed. He also \nsustained cuts and bruises on his arms, legs, knees, and face, all of which were \nbleeding. He had blood on his pants, and t he front, sleeves, and shoulders of his \nshirt. There were holes in his pants and shirt. Defendant Ridall then stomped on the \nback of Plaintiff Haskellโs neck with steel-toed boots for five to ten minutes straight \nwhile another officer sat on Plaintiff Haskellโs back. Plaintiff Haskell was then picked \nup off the ground, placed on his feet, and walked toward segregation. His wrists \nwere bleeding. Plaintiff Haskell could hardly walk, but was pushed forward by an \nofficer and told to hurry up. The officer then pushed Plaintiff Haskellโs head into a \ngate at the segregation unit, which causedm  ore bleeding. When the group arrived at \nthe segregation unit, Plaintiff Haskell was placed in the shower. He tapped on the \ndoor and asked to see the nurse. Defendant Ridall opened the door, told Plaintiff \n                                                                                                                                                             \ndoes not apply.  \n \n7 \n \n\nHaskell to shut up, grabbed Plaintiff Haskell by the throat, pushed him against the \nback of the shower causing Plaintiff Haskell to hit the showerhead, and choked \nPlaintiff Haskell until he blacked out. Plaintiff Haskell woke up on the shower floor \nand another officer escorted him to a cell. Plaintiff Haskell asked the officer to call \nmedical, but the officer said he would not call anyone. Plaintiff Haskell was still in \nhandcuffs. After Plaintiff Haskell was placed in a cell, he banged on the door trying to \nget someone to come to him. Defendant Ridall came to the cell and shoved Plaintiff \nHaskellโs head against the wall. Defendant Rdiall said he would not get a nurse, and \nleft Plaintiff Haskell in the cell, still handcuffed. Plaintiff Haskell was seen in medical \nthe following day, where he received stitches in his lip and knee.   \n  Defendant Ridall acknowledges that the video camera was not called for until \nafter Plaintiff Haskell was removed from the dorm and was being taken to the \nsegregation unit. Thus it is possible that  any use of force as alleged by Plaintiff \nHaskell occurred before the taping started. The Court has reviewed the videotape \nsubmitted by Defendant Ridall and agrees with Judge Langstaff that the videotape \ndoes not unequivocally contradict Plaintiff Haskellโs version of the facts and require \njudgment in Defendant Ridallโs favor. The Court agrees with Defendant Ridall that \nthere are definite discrepancies between Plani tiff Haskellโs prior testimony and what \nis shown on the videotape, but does not believe judgment in Defendant Ridallโs favor \nis appropriate at this time. Counsel for Defendant Ridall will be allowed to impeach \nPlaintiff Haskell at trial as allowed by law. Defendant Ridallโs objection is overruled. \n \n8 \n \n\nIV.  Defendants Maine, Howell, Brown, Yancey, Schnake, and Ridallโs Motion \n  to Sever or, in the Alternative, Motion for Separate Trials and Motion to \n  Bifurcate  (Doc. 116)/Defendant Ratliffโs Motion to Sever or, in the \n  Alternative, Motion for Separate Trials (Doc. 117)/Defendant Smithโs \n  Motion  to Sever or, in the Alternative, Motion for Separate Trials \n  (Doc. 118) \n \n  Defendants have moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 to sever \nPlaintiffsโ claims into separate actions. Defendants have moved in the alternative \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42 for separate trials.3  \n  Rule 21, which governs severances, provides in part that โ[t]he court may also \nsever any claim against a party.โ Fed.R.Civ.P. 21. Under Rule 42, a court may order \na separate trial of any claim or issue โ[f]o r convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to \nexpedite and economize.โ Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b). Motions for severance and motions \nfor separate trial are distinct and should be treated as such. McDaniel v. Anheuser-\nBusch, Inc., 987 F.2d 298, 304 (5th Cir. 1993). โSeparate trials of claims originally \nsued upon together usually will result in the entry of one judgment, but severed \nclaims become entirely independent actions to be tried, and judgment entered \nthereon, independently.โ 9A Charles A.W  right & Arthur R. Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE \nAND PROCEDURE ยง 2387 (3d ed. 2011).  \n  The same factors are considered when ruling on a motion for severance and a \nmotion for separate trials. The factors are:  (1) whether the claims arise out of the \n                                                 \n3 The Court rejects Plaintiffsโ argument that the motions are untimely. \n \n9 \n \n\nsame transaction or occurrence; (2) whether the claims present some common \nquestions of law or fact; (3) whether settlement of the claims or judicial economy \nwould be facilitated; (4) whether prejudice would be avoided if severance were \ngranted; and (5) whether different witnesses and documentary proof are required for \nthe  separate claims. In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litigation, 293 \nF.Supp.2d  854, 862 (C.D. Ill. 2003); Morris v. Northrop Grumman Corp., 37 \nF.Supp.2d 556, 580 (E.D.N.Y. 1999).  \n  After consideration of the summary judgment motions, the following claims \nremain pending: \nPlaintiff Hengโs excessive force claim against Defendants \nPowers, Howell, Brown, Yancey, Smith, and Ratliff \n \nPlaintiff Askewโs excessive force claim against Defendants \nPowers, Howell, Brown, Yancey, and Schnake \n   \nPlaintiff  Haskellโs March 2008 excessive force claim \nagainst Defendant Ridall \n \n  The Court finds that severance of the remaining claims is appropriate. The \nonly commonality in the claims is that the Plaintiffs were housed at Valdosta State \nPrison when the alleged excessive uses of force occurred. The alleged beatings \ninvolve different time periods, involve different factual circumstances, and involve \ndifferent evidence. While there are some common questions of law running through \nthe three claims, those questions s hould be addressed separately based on the \nunique facts presented in each case. The Court believes there is a real risk of \n \n10 \n \n\nprejudice to the Defendants if the Plaintiffsโ claims are presented in one trial, as the \njury may impute liability to a defendant based on events in which he was not \ninvolved.  \nV.  CONCLUSION \n  The Court accepts and adopts the Recommendation (Doc. 153) to deny \nDefendant Rodney Smithโs Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 127). The Court \naccepts and adopts the Recommendation (Doc. 154) to grant Defendant Willie \nRatliffโs Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 131) as to Plaintiff Walkerโs claims \nonly. The Court accepts and adopts the Recommendation (Doc. 155) to grant, in \npart, and deny, in part, Defendants Maine, Howell, Brown, Ridall, Yancey, and \nSchnakeโs Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 133). Summary judgment is granted \nin favor of Defendants Maine, Howell, and Brown on Plaintiff Walkerโs claims against \nthem. Summary judgment is granted in favor of Defendant Maine on Plaintiff Hengโs \nand Plaintiff Askewโs claims against him. Summary judgment in Defendant Ridallโs \nfavor as to Plaintiff Haskellโs claims is denied. Plaintiff Walkerโs claims are dismissed \nin their entirety without prejudice. Defendant Maine is dismissed from the case.   \n  The Motions to Sever filed by Defendants Howell, Brown, Yancey, Schnake, \nand Ridall (Doc. 116), Defendant Ratliff (Doc. 117), and Defendant Smith (Doc. 118) \nare granted. The alternative request for separate trials is moot.   \n \n11 \n \n\n  The claims asserted by Plaintiff Heng against Defendants Powers, Howell, \nBrown, Yancey, Smith, and Ratliff are seveerd from this civil action pursuant to Rule \n21. The Clerk of Court is directed to open an ew separate civil action file for the case \nof Pip Heng v. Jamie Powers, Jesse Howell, Terry Brown, Andre Yancey, Rodney \nSmith, and Willie Ratliff, which should be assigned to the undersigned. Pleadings \nthat were filed prior to this severance need not be re-filed, but all future filings must \nbe made in the new civil action. However ,because Defendant Powers is currently in \nbankruptcy, the new civil action will be stayed until he is discharged from bankruptcy. \nIt would not be in the interest of judicial economy to try the case against Defendants \nHowell, Brown, Yancey, Smith, and Ratlfif now and against Defendant Powers later. \nCounsel  for Defendant Powers is to notify the Court immediately upon the \ntermination of his bankruptcy case.  \n  The claims asserted by Plaintiff Askew against Defendants Powers, Howell, \nBrown, Yancey, and Schnake are also severed from this civil action pursuant to Rule \n21. The Clerk of Court is directed to open an ew separate civil action file for the case \nof Ronny N. Askew v. Jamie Powers, Jesse Howell, Terry Brown, Andre Yancey, \nand Joseph Schnake, which should be assigned to the undersigned. Pleadings that \nwere filed prior to this severance need not be re-filed, but all future filings must be \nmade in the new civil action. This new civil action must also be stayed because of \nDefendant Powersโ bankruptcy.   \n \n12 \n \n\n  The claims asserted by Plaintiff Haskell against Defendant Ridall will remain in \nCivil  Action 7:08-CV-5. That case will go to trial in July of 2012. Additional \ninformation about the trial and pretrial conference will be sent out in the near future. \nIn light of his previous filings, the Court believes it necessary to notify Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel now that he will not be allowed to โput the system on trial.โ The trial will be \nrestricted to the specific excessive force claim relating to Plaintiff Haskell and \nDefendant Ridall. The Court will not allows peeches or argument or testimony about \nwhat may have taken place at other prisons. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 14th day of March, 2012. \n           s/ Hugh Lawson                             \nHUGH LAWSON, SENIOR JUDGE \nmbh \n \n13 \n ",

Langstaff (Doc. 93), entered on January 25, 2011. The\nMagistrate Judge recommends that Defendants Donald, Jacobs, Draper, Lewis, Hart,\nMcLaughlin, Jones, Maine, Powers, Howell, Brown, Yancy, Cannon, Schnake, Lucas,\nProctor, Ridall, Glenn, Jackson, and Williamsโ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffsโ Second\nAmended Complaint (Doc. 71) be granted, in part, and denied, in part; that Defendant\nRatliffโs Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffsโ Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 73) be granted,\nin part, and denied, in part; and that Defendant Smithโs Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffsโ\nSecond Amended Complaint (Doc. 74) be granted, in part, and denied, in part. Plaintiffs\nhave filed an objection to the Recommendation (Doc. 94). The Court has made a de\nnovo review of the portions of the Recommendation to which objection is made. \nA.  Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies\nThe Magistrate Judge recommends that the claims of Plaintiffs Keel, Greene,\nand  Hart  be  dismissed  for  failure  to  exhaust  administrative  remedies.  He  also\n\nrecommends that Plaintiff Haskellโs December 2006 and January 2008 claims be\ndismissed for failure to exhaust.\nWhile Plaintiffs devote 12 pages of text to their argument about exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies, they make only one clear objection to the Recommendation.\nPlaintiffs contend that the Magistrate Judge ignored the case of Graham v. Henderson,\n315 Fed. Appx. 849 (11th Cir. 2009), in reaching his decision on the exhaustion issue. \nAs the other exhaustion arguments contained in the objection are nothing more than\ncut and pasted sections from Plaintiffsโ response to the motions to dismiss and contain\nno discussion about how the Magistrate Judge erred, the Court will only consider the\nargument as to the Graham case.\nIn Graham, the prisoner plaintiff filed a civil rights action alleging physical abuse.\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,\nwhich was granted by the district court. The Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded\nthe case, finding that the prisoner did exhaust the required administrative remedies.\nThe Graham plaintiff filed an informal grievance, but the defendants never responded\nand never gave the plaintiff a formal grievance form, despite the fact that the applicable\nstandard  operating  procedure  required  that  when  an  informal  grievance  alleged\nphysical  abuse,  the  counselor  was  to  forward  the  grievance  to  the  grievance\ncoordinator within two business days of receipt, and the grievance coordinator was to\nensure that the inmate was promptly issued a formal grievance form. Id. at *1. The\nEleventh Circuit determined that the plaintiff adequately exhausted his administrative\n2\n\nremedies because the defendants did not respond to the plaintiffโs informal grievance,\nthe informal grievance was not transmitted to the grievance coordinator within two\nbusiness days, and neither the counselor nor the grievance coordinator met with the\nplaintiff or provided a formal grievance form. Id.\nPlaintiffs Keel, Hart, Haskell, and Greene contend that they filed their initial\ninformal grievances but were not notified of the denial of their informal grievances or\nfurnished with formal grievances so that they could proceed to the next step in the\ngrievance process. Plaintiffs contend that since they were not notified of the denial of\ntheir informal grievances and were not provided with formal grievance forms, they have\nexhausted the grievance procedure to the extent available. The Court will review the\nevidence relating to each Plaintiff in turn.\nPlaintiff Keel contends that he was beaten on August 2, 2006. Defendants have\nfiled a copy of an informal grievance form completed and signed by Plaintiff Keel on\nAugust 10, 2006 (Doc. 71-5, p. 5), in which he alleges that he was assaulted on August\n2, 2006. Plaintiff Keel signed the bottom of the informal grievance, showing that his\ncomplaint  was  not  resolved.  Further,  Defendants  have  filed  a  formal  grievance\ncompleted and signed by Plaintiff Keel dated August 30, 2006 (Doc. 71-5, p. 3), in\nwhich he alleges he was assaulted on August 2, 2006. The contentions that Plaintiff\nKeel did not receive a response to his informal grievance and that he did not receive\nformal grievance form are directly contradicted by the evidence. The claim that Plaintiff\n3\n\nKeel has exhausted his administrative remedies as provided by Graham fails. Plaintiffsโ\nobjection as to Plaintiff Keel is overruled.1 \nPlaintiff Hart contends he was assaulted on June 26, 2007. Defendants have\nfiled a copy of an informal grievance form completed and signed by Plaintiff Hart on\nJune 27, 2007 (Doc. 71-9, p. 4), in which he alleges that he was beaten on June 26,\n2007. Plaintiff Hart signed the bottom of the informal grievance, showing that his\ncomplaint  was  not  resolved.  Further,  Defendants  have  filed  a  formal  grievance\ncompleted and signed by Plaintiff Hart dated July 18, 2007 (Doc. 71-9, p. 2), in which\nhe alleges he was assaulted on June 26, 2007. The contentions that Plaintiff Hart did\nnot receive a response to his informal grievance and that he did not receive formal\ngrievance form are directly contradicted by the evidence. Plaintiffsโ objection as to\nPlaintiff Hart is overruled.\nPlaintiff Haskell contends he was beaten in December of 2006 and January of\n2008. With regard to the January 2008 incident, Defendants have filed a copy of an\ninformal grievance form completed and signed by Plaintiff Haskell on January 14, 2008\n(Doc. 71-7, p. 4), in which he alleges that he was assaulted. Plaintiff Haskell signed the\nbottom of the informal grievance, showing that his complaint was not resolved. Further,\nDefendants have filed a formal grievance completed and signed by Plaintiff Haskell\ndated January 29, 2008 (Doc. 71-7, p. 2), in which he alleges he was assaulted on\n1The informal grievance form filed by Plaintiff Keel on September 25, 2006 does not relate\nto the August 2, 2006 incident. (Doc. 90-1, p. 22). In any event, as reflected on the bottom\nof the informal grievance form, Plaintiff Keel received a response to that grievance as well. \n4\n\nJanuary 10, 2008. The contentions that Plaintiff Haskell did not receive a response to\nhis  informal  grievance  and  that  he  did  not  receive  formal  grievance  form  are \ncontradicted by the evidence. \nAs for the December 2006 incident, Defendants have filed a copy of an informal\ngrievance form completed and signed by Plaintiff Haskell on January 5, 2007 (Doc. 71-\n8, p. 3), in which he alleges he was assaulted on December 8, 2006. The informal\ngrievance was denied as untimely (Doc. 71-8, p. 2). The evidence contradicts Plaintiff\nHaskellโs argument that he did not receive any response to his informal grievance. The\nclaim that Plaintiff Haskell has exhausted his administrative remedies as provided by\nGraham with respect to the December 2006 incident fails. Plaintiffsโ objection as to\nPlaintiff Haskell is overruled.\nFinally, Plaintiff Greene contends that he was beaten on November 14, 2007.\nDefendants have provided evidence that Plaintiff Green never filed a grievance alleging\nthat he was assaulted on that date. Plaintiffs have provided the Court with an informal\ngrievance form dated November 14, 2007, in which Plaintiff Greene states he was\nassaulted on that same date (Doc. 85-1, p. 21). Defendants contend that the form was\nnever submitted to prison officials, as if it had been submitted, the bottom portion would\nhave been completed by Plaintiff Greeneโs counselor and provided to him as a receipt.\nThe bottom portion of the form submitted to the Court by Plaintiff Greene is not\ncompleted or detached. As Defendants have established Plaintiff Greeneโs failure to\nexhaust, Plaintiff Greene must come forward with competent evidence to the contrary.\n5\n\nHowever, Plaintiff Greene has provided no evidence that he actually filed the informal\ngrievance. He has provided no explanation as to why he has no receipt for the alleged\nfiling, and in fact, he never addresses the lack of receipt issue at all. It appears to the\nCourt  that  the  informal  grievance  form  was  never  properly  submitted  to  prison\nauthorities, which means Plaintiff Greene did not exhaust his administrative remedies.\nThus, Plaintiffsโ objection as to Plaintiff Greene is also overruled.\nB. Statute of Limitations\nFor some reason unknown to the Court, Plaintiffs have objected to the Magistrate\nJudgeโs  ruling  on  Defendantsโ  statute  of  limitations  argument.  The  only  Plaintiff\naddressed in that portion of the Recommendation is Plaintiff Walker, and the Magistrate\nJudge recommended that Defendantsโ motion to dismiss Plaintiff Walkerโs claim as\ntime-barred be denied. Plaintiffsโ objection on this point is overruled.\nC. Failure to State a Claim - Supervisory Liability\nThe Magistrate Judge recommends that Defendants Hart, McLaughlin, Donald,\nJacobs, Lewis, Jones, and Draper (the โSupervisory Defendantsโ) be dismissed from\nthis case. He states that the allegations against the Supervisory Defendants are\nconclusory in nature, and that Plaintiffs have failed to plead factual content so that the\ncourt can draw the reasonable inference that the Supervisory Defendants are liable for\nthe misconduct alleged as required by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, --- U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 1937,\n1949-50 (2009). \n6\n\nIn  the  Second  Amended  Complaint,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  the  Supervisory\nDefendants have โcondoned and have been deliberately indifferent to the beatings of\nPlaintiffs  .  .  .,โ  have  โcondoned  and  have  been  deliberately  indifferent  and  are\ncontinuing to condone and be deliberately indifferent to the beatings of restrained\ninmates . . . ,โ and have โcovered up the pattern and practice of beatings by restrained\ninmates . . .โ (Doc. 64). In order to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege\nfacts that, if true, โstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at\n1949 (quotation omitted). A claim is plausible where the plaintiff alleges facts that\nโallow[ ] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the\nmisconduct alleged.โ Id. A plaintiff must allege sufficient facts โto raise a reasonable\nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidenceโ that supports the plaintiffโs claim. Bell\nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007). Conclusory\nstatements, without more, are insufficient to show a right to relief. See Iqbal, 129 S.Ct.\nat 1949.\n While Plaintiffs are correct that the allegations in the complaint must be taken\nas true for purposes of the motion to dismiss, Powell v. Lennon, 914 F.2d 1459, 1463\n(11th Cir. 1990), the allegations against the Supervisory Defendants are nothing more\nthan the sort of conclusions the Supreme Court rejected in Iqbal, where the respondent\nalleged that the petitioners โknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to\nsubject [him]โ to harsh conditions of confinement โas a matter of policy . . . .โ Iqbal, 129\nS.Ct. at 1951. The Magistrate Judge was correct in finding that the Second Amended\n7\n\nComplaint fails to state a claim against the Supervisory Defendants. Plaintiffsโ objection\non this point is overruled.\nD.  Conclusion\nThe Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge Thomas Q. Langstaff\n(Doc. 93), as modified herein, is adopted and made the order of the Court. Defendants\nDonald, et al.โs Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 71) is granted, in part, and denied, in part.\nDefendant Ratliffโs Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 73) is granted, in part, and denied, in part.\nDefendant Smithโs Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 74) is granted, in part, and denied, in part.\nThe claims made by Plaintiffs Keel, Hart, and Greene are dismissed for failure to\nexhaust.  The  December  2006  and  January  2008  claims  by  Plaintiff  Haskell  are\ndismissed for failure to exhaust. Defendants Lucas, Proctor, Glenn, Jackson, Waddell,\nWilliams, Hart, McLaughlin, Donald, Jacobs, Lewis, Jones, and Draper are dismissed. \nDefendant Cannon is also dismissed as he is deceased.\nThe remaining Plaintiffs are Heng, Askew, Walker, and Haskell (as to the March\n2008 claim only). The remaining Defendants are Maine, Powers, Howell, Smith, Ratliff,\nBrown, Ridall, Yancy, and Schnake. \nThe Court sets the following schedule for discovery and motions:\nDiscovery expires on June 6, 2011. No discovery request may be served unless\nthe response to the request can be completed within the time specified by the rules and\nwithin the discovery period. Except by written consent of the parties first filed with the\nCourt, no deposition shall be scheduled beyond the discovery period. \n8\n\nPlaintiffs must disclose the identity of any expert witnesses on or before April 7,\n2011. Defendants must disclose the identity of any expert witnesses on or before April\n22, 2011. If Defendants designate an expert where Plaintiffs have not previously\ndesignated  an  expert,  Plaintiffs  shall  have  15  days  from  the  designation  of  the\nDefendantsโ expert within which to designate a rebuttal expert witness.  \nThe designation of any expert witness must be accompanied by a written report\nprepared  and  signed  by  the  expert  in  accordance  with  Rule  26(a)(2)(B).  Any\ndesignated expert witness must be available to be deposed during the discovery\nperiod.\nAny supplemental expert reports must be provided to opposing counsel on or \nbefore May 6, 2011. No additional supplemental reports may be disclosed or provided\nafter this date without leave of Court.\nAll motions to join other parties or to otherwise amend the pleadings shall be filed\non or before June 21, 2011.\nAll dispositive motions shall be filed on or before July 6, 2011.\nAll Daubert motions must be filed on or before June 21, 2011. The parties are\ninstructed not to file Daubert motions as part of dispositive motions.\nGiven the age of this case, and the fact that it is a relatively straight\nforward excessive use of force case, the Court does not intend to grant any\nextensions of the discovery and motion deadlines, and will only do so in extreme\ncircumstances. In the event either party wants an extension of any of these\n9\n\ndeadlines, a motion outlining specific reasons why additional time is needed\nmust be filed. The Clerk of Court is not authorized to grant any extensions of\ntime for briefing. Any such requests must be made to the Court through an\nappropriate motion. \nRequests for admission that are propounded solely to authenticate documents\nas provided for under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36(a)(1)(B) are excluded from\nLocal Rule 36โs limitation on the number of requests to admit that can be propounded.\nThe parties are limited by the Local Rules to twenty-five interrogatories (L. R.\n33.1), ten requests for production (L. R. 34), and fifteen requests for admissions (L. R.\n36). The parties may not exceed these limits without filing a motion and receiving\nwritten permission from the Court.\nAll applications to the Court for orders shall be presented in the form of written\nmotions filed pursuant to the Local Rules. Letters, faxes, and telephone calls will not\nbe accepted in lieu of a properly filed motion unless requested or otherwise authorized\nby the Court.  \nAny request for leave of absence should be filed in the form of a motion. The\nCourt will not consider notices filed pursuant to Uniform Superior Court Rule 16.\nDo not send courtesy copies of letters, motions, or briefs to the Court.\nSO ORDERED, this the 14th day of March, 2011.\ns/ Hugh Lawson                             \nmbh HUGH LAWSON, SENIOR JUDGE\n10",
