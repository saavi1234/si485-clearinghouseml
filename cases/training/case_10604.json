    "summary": "<p>On May 24, 2007, the Governor of Florida signed into law the Act set forth in CS/SB 1088, Ch. 2007-62, Laws of Fla. (\"the Act\").  The Act provided for the establishment of five Offices of Criminal Conflict and Civil Regional Counsel (OCCCRCs) which would be responsible for handling a majority of criminal conflict cases as well as certain civil cases on behalf of indigent clients.  The Act further provided that the Offices were to be directed by five Criminal Conflict and Civil Regional Counsel (CCCRC) which would be appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate.  Pursuant to the Act, the Governor appointed the five CCCRC on August 21, 2007.</p><p>On September 11, 2007, the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (FACDL) wrote the State Attorney General to assert that the Act was violative of the State Constitution and to request that the Attorney General initiate a petition for writ quo warranto (a means of enforcing a public right) on FACDL's behalf in the Florida Supreme Court.  By letter dated September 17, 2007, the Attorney General denied FACDL's request.</p><p>On September 20, 2007, FACDL filed suit in the Supreme Court of Florida seeking a writ of quo warranto against the Governor, the Senate, the Secretary of State, and the five CCCRC appointed by the Governor.  FACDL alleged that the Act violated the State Constitution in that it effectively established a second-tier of public defenders without satisfying the Constitutional requirements that such defenders (a) be elected and (b) reside in the territorial jurisdiction of the circuit in which they work.  Specifically, FACDL noted that, under the Act, each CCCRC (a) would be appointed rather than elected and (b) would reside within the geographic boundaries of the District Court of Appeals rather than each circuit.  On these grounds, FACDL requested that the Supreme Court issue a writ of quo warranto (a) declaring the Act void as violative of the Florida Constitution; (b) quashing the Governor's appointments of the five CCCRC under the Act; (c) enjoining the Senate from confirming the five CCCRC; and (d) enjoining the five CCCRC from performing any duties under the Act.</p><p>On October 30, 2007, the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit in and for Leon County (Judge P. Kevin Davey) issued a writ of quo warranto and directed the Defendants to show cause as to why such relief should not be granted.  </p><p>After holding a December 19, 2007 hearing, the Circuit Court issued a December 20, 2007 order granting Plaintiff's petition for writ of quo warranto.  Concluding that the Act failed to abide by the State Constitution, the Circuit Court granted the requested relief by (a) quashing the Governor's appointments; (b) enjoining the Secretary of State from submitting certificates of appointment to the Senate; (c) enjoining the Senate from confirming the CCCRC; and (d) enjoining the CCCRC from performing their duties under the Act.</p><p>On December 20, 2007, the same day that the Circuit Court's order was issued, the Defendants filed their notice of appeal to the First District Court of Appeal.  Pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.310, an automatic stay of the December 20 order went into effect.</p><p>On January 8, 2008, Plaintiff FACDL filed a motion to dissolve the automatic stay.  The Circuit Court (Judge Davey) conducted an expedited hearing on the motion on January 9, 2008.  On January 11, 2008, the Circuit Court (Judge Davey) issued an order lifting the automatic stay.  In issuing this order, the Circuit Court noted that Defendants had not demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on their appeal and that, absent dissolution of the stay, more taxpayer money could be spent on the constitutionally infirm OCCCRC system created by the Act.  The Circuit Court also recognized, however, that immediately lifting the stay could harm the Due Process rights of indigent defendants already being represented by the OCCCRC and could also harm those lawyers and staff who left other employment in order to take positions with the OCCCRC.  In light of these competing concerns, the Circuit Court ordered that the OCCCRC be enjoined from continuing to operate with the exception that the OCCCRC could continue to represent clients in criminal appointments made through January 18, 2008 and civil appointments made through January 31, 2008.</p><p></p>",

The  court  is \nnot  concerned  with  the  wisdom  of the policy  of  legislation, \nso  long  such  legislation  squares  with  the  Constitution. \na~ \nHolley  v.  Adams,  238  So.  2d  401,·  404  (Fla.  1970). \nTherefore,  this  Court  declines  to  address  any  issues \nregarding.the  public  policy  of  establishing Offices  of \nCriminal  Cbnflict  and  Civil  Regional  Counsel. \nthis  Court  will  not  consider  the \nSirni~arly, \nconstitutionality of  the  funding  mechanism  presented  in \n.  .  . \nthis  Legislation,  which  Petitionsr  asserts  is  violative  of \nArticle  v,  §  14  of  the  Florida  Constitution.  3 \nThe  primary  issue  properly  before  this  Court .is \nwhether  Chapter  2007-62,. Laws  of  Florida  requires  th~ \nGovernor  and  the  Senate  t6 exceed their constitutional \n. authorliy  by  appointing  and  confirming,  respectively/the \n'r~gional counsel  responde~ts.  The  cburt  finds  that  it \ndoes. \nior \n3section 14  provides,  in pertinent part,  that  funding  \"pubiic \ndefender  offices\",  inter ;;lid,  \"shall  be  provided  ir.om  State revenues \nappropriated  by  general  law.\"  (emphasis  ·supplied).  The  leoislation in \nquestion  mandates  that  this  species 'of Public Defender be  funded  by  the \nvarious  county governments. \n4 \n\n12/2B/2BB7  15:51  85B922B327  2ND  CIRCUIT  CT  FL  PAGE  05/08 \nThe  court  agrees  with  Petitioner. that  the  regional \ncounsel  respondents  are  essentially public  defenders  that \nhave  not  been  subject ·to.the  qualifications  provided  by \nArticle  V,  section  18  of  the  Florida Constitution.  An \nexamination  of  Chapter  2007-62,  Laws  of  Florida,  reveals \nthat  the  Legislature  has  attempted  to  create  a  hybrid  state \n.  . \noffice  that  is  a  public  defender .for some  purposes4,  such  as \nfunding;  but ·i5  not  a  public  defender  for  purposes  of \nArticle  V,  Section  18.  Ac~ordingly, the  court  finds  that. \nChapter  2007-62,  Laws  of  Florida,  amounts  to  an  attempt  to \namend  the  Constitution  by  legislative  fiat.  The  Supreme \nCourt  of \" Florida  has  explained  that  the  Constitution \n\"cannot  b~.changed,  modified.or  amended  by  legislative or \njudicial  fiat.  It  provides  within  itself the  only method \nfor  its amendment.\"  Cook  v.  City  of Jacksonville,  823  So: \n2d86,  94·  (Fla.  2002) (citations  omitted). \nFurthermore,  our  Supreme  Court  has  stated: \nW~ere t~e Constitution· expressly prov~desthe manner \nof  doing  a  thing,  it impliedlj.forbids  its being  done \nin  a  substantially different  manner.  .  .  .  Therefore, \nwhere  the  Constitution  prescribes  the  manner  of doing \nan  act,  the  manrier  prescribed  is  ~xclusiver  and .it  is \nbeyond  the· power  of  the  Legislature  to  enact  a  statute \nthat·.would  defeat  the  purpose  of  the  constittitional \nprovision. \nBush  v.  Holmes,  919  So.  2d  392,  407  (Fla.  2006). \n4See  Section  29.009(1),  Florida Statutes,  which  includes  the  offices of \ncriminal  conflict  and  civil regional  counsel in  the  definition  of \npublic defenders. \n5 \n\n12/20/2007  16:51  85139220327  2ND  CIRCUIT  CT  FL  PAGE  El7/ B8 \nTherefore,  Chapter  2007 -62,  Laws  of  Florida,  carlnot \nalter  the  constitutional  requirements  provided  by \n~rticle \nV,  Section  18  of  the  Florida  Constitution.  Because  this \npro*ision  requires  public  defenders  to  be  elected  and \nreside  in  the  territorial  jurisdiction of  his  or  her \nrespective  circuit,  the  court  finds  that  the  Governor  acted \noutsi~e ~is constitutional  authority by  appointing  the \nregional  conflict  counsel  respondents;  and  the  Senate' would \nexceed' its  constitutional  authority by  confirming  t~~se \nappointment·s. \nBased  upon  ~his legal  analysis  of  the  clear and \nestablished precedent  in  Florida,' the  Petition  f6r ~rit of \nQuo  Warranto  should be.granted. \nAccordingly, Cit  is  ORDERED  and  ADJUDGED  that: \n1.}  Respondent  Governor  Charlie  Crist's  appointments \nofRespondent~ Jeffrey  Lewis,  Ja6kson  F~yte, \nJoseph  George,  Jr.,  Philip Ma~sa and  Jeffrey.Dean \na~ Criminal  Conflict  and  Civil  Regional  Counsel \nare  hereby  QUASHED; \n2.}  Respondent  Kurt  S.

Alternatively,  Petitioner  sought  a  declaration  from  this \nCourt  that  the  automatic  stay  provision  was  inapplicable  to  this \ncase. \nThe  Court  conducted  an  expedited  hearing  on  January  9,  2008 \nbecause  of  the  real  and  potential  judicial  upheaval  this  case  has \nengendered  statewide.  Based  upon  the  evidence  presented  at  that \nhearing,  the  arguments  of  counsel,  the  Court  makes  the  following \nlegal  conclusions  and  findings  of  fact: \n\nA.  The  automatic  stay  provision  of  Rule  9.310,  Fla.  R.  App. \nP.,  is  applicable  to  this  proceeding.  Each  of  the  Respondents  is \nacting  in  their official  capacity  to  enforce  a  public  right  for  the \npurposes  of  the  notice  of  appeal  filed  December  20,  2007. \nB.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  dissolve  the  automatic \nstay.  Mitchell  v.  State,  911  So.  2d  1211,  1216  (Fla.  2005). \nC.  In  Mitchell,  the  Florida  Supreme  Court  outlined  the  two \nprincipal  considerations  that  courts  must  take  into  account  when \ndeciding  whether  to  vacate  a  stay:  \"  the  likelihood  of \nirreparable  harm  if the  stay  is  not  granted  and  the  likelihood  of \nsuccess  on  the  merits  by  the  entity seeking  to maintain  the  stay.\" \n911  So.  2d  at  1219.  See  also  Tampa  Sports  Authority v.  Johnson, \n914  So.2d  1076,  1079  (Fla.  2d  DCA  2005) . \nD.  It has  not  been  demonstrated  that  the  Respondents  have  a \nlikelihood  of  prevailing  on  their  appeal.  As  detailed  in  the \nCourt's  earlier Order,  the  constitutional  deficiencies  of  Chapter \n2007-62,  Laws  of  Fla.  (May  24,  2007),  are  substantial,  in  the \nopinion  of  this  Court. \nE.  If the  stay  is  not  dissolved,  an  increasingly  significant \namount  of  taxpayer  money  will  continue  to  be  spent  by  the  five \nCriminal  Conflict  and  Civil  Regional  Counsel  (CCCRC)  in purchasing \noffice  equipment,  entering  into  building  leases,  paying  the \nsalaries  of  personnel,  and  miscellaneous  other  expenses,  little of \nwhich  may  be  recouped.  Additionally,  a  constitutionally  infirm, \n-2 -\n\nadministratively  confusing,  and  financially  profligate  dual  system \nwill  grow  exponentially  with  the  passage  of  time,  with  the  real \npotential  to  impair  the  due  process  rights  of  Florida's  criminal \nand  civil  litigants.  1  Thus,  dissolving  the  automatic  stay  will \npreserve  precious  state  and  county  resources,  which  Chapter  2007-\n62,  ironically was  intended  to  accomplish. \nF.  Of  paramount  concern  to  this  Court,  should  the  stay \nremain  intact  is  that  ultimately,  and  in  short  order,  the  due \nprocess  rights  of  indigent  criminal  defendants  and  civil  litigants \nwill  likely be  compromised.  There  is  no  tolerance  for  this  under \nour  Constitutions  and  there  should  be  none.  The  harm  in \nmaintaining  the  stay  in  its  present  posture  is  both  likely  and \nirreparable. \nG.  Although  lifting the  stay certainly will  create  a  degree \nof  administrative  uncertainty  and  judicial  upheaval,  the  evidence \npresented  at  the  hearing  before  this  Court  makes  clear  that  harm, \nboth  real  and  potential,  will  increase  over  time  as  these  offices \nreceive  new  appointments. \nH.  In  considering  the  wholesale  dissolution  of  the  stay  as \nPetitioner  requests,  this  Court  recognizes  other  concerns \nwhich  must  be  addressed.  In  addition  to  the  rights  of  the \n1 The  Court  takes  judicial notice that  Florida's  financial  resources  are  finite.  All \nlevels of government  are making  tremendous  cuts  in budgets  and  services.  The  evidence \ndemonstrated that  the Justice Administrative Commission budget  was  cut  for  this fiscal \nyear.  The  additional  layer of bureaucracy necessary to  implement  Chapter 2007-62 \nsignificantly reduces  the  funds  available to provide the  legal  counsel  required by our \nConstitution. \n- 3 -\n\npotential  clients  of  the  OCCCRC,  this  Court  must  safeguard  the  due \nprocess  rights  of  those  Florida  citizens  already being  represented \nby  the  OCCCRC,  as  well  as  protect  the  orderly  operation  of  the \nState's  courts  while  those  cases  proceed  to  their  conclusion. \nForcing  the  Respondents  to  immediately  withdraw  from  all  pending \ncases  would  potentially create  the  same  problems  which  this  Court \nis  attempting  to  ameliorate  by  the  relief  fashioned  in  this  Order. \nMoreover,  after  further  argument,  and  consideration by  this  Court, \n2  immediately  enj oining  the  OCCCRC  from  accepting  new  cases  as \npreviously  announced  at  the  conclusion  of  the  January  9,  2008 \nhearing,  is  impractical  from  a  court  administration  perspective. \nI.  Inasmuch,  as  private  counsel  appointed  under  the  pre-\nexisting  conflict  attorney  system  are  not  permitted  to  bill  the \nstate or  the  counties  for  costs  related to  office  space,  equipment, \nsecretarial  assistance  or  other  overhead  expenses,  governmental \nresources  which  would  be  spent  on  such  overhead  for  the  OCCCRC  if \nthe  stay  is  not  lifted,  will  be  preserved  pending  ultimate \nresolution  by  the  Florida  Supreme  Court.  3 \nJ.  Where  there  may  be  an  insufficient  number  of  registry \nattorneys  to  appoint  to  cases  that  previously  would  have  been \nhandled  by  the  OCCCCRC,  Article  V  of  the  Florida  Constitution \n2  A supplemental  hearing was  conducted by  telephone at  10:30  a.m.  on January 11, \n2008.  The  dates  set  forth  in section  (b)  of the decretal portion of this Order were \nstipulated by counsel  for  the parties \n3  It should be  noted that the vast majority of cases,  criminal and  civil,  filed since \nthe effective date of this  legislation are  currently being handled by counsel \nappointed under the pre-existing,  conflict counsel,  system. \n-4-\n\ngives  judges  the  inherent  authority  to  appoint  qualified  counsel \n(excluding  the  CCCRC  pursuant  to  this  Order)  to  protect  the  due \nprocess  rights  of  the  indigent  Floridians  affected  herein.  See \nOlive  v.  Maas,  811  So.  2d  644,  652  (Fla.  2002);  Makemson  v. \nMartin  County,  491  So.  2d  1109,  1115  (Fla.  1990). \nK.  Finally,  the  immediate  shutdown  of  the  OCCCRC  would \nunfairly  and  severely  impact  those  lawyers  and  staff who  left other \nemployment  and  took  positions  with  the  OCCCRC  with  the  good  faith \nbelief  that  such  employment  and  its  attendant  benefits  would  be \nreasonably  secure.  The  Court  has  an  obligation  to  consider  these \nstate  employees  and  their  families  when  fashioning  the  appropriate \nrelief  in  this  controversy. \nBased  upon  these  findings  and  legal  conclusions,  it is, \nORDERED  AND  ADJUDGED  as  follows: \nThe  automatic  stay  is  hereby  dissolved  and  the  Offices  of \nCriminal  Conflict  and  Civil  Regional  Counsel  are  hereby  enjoined \nfrom  continuing  to  operate  and  accept  appointments  subj ect  to \nChapter  2007-62,  Laws  of  Florida,  subject  to  the  following  limited \nexceptions: \na.  The  Offices  of  Criminal  Conflict  and  Civil  Regional \nCounsel  may  continue  to  represent  those  criminal  clients  to \nwhom  they may  be  appointed  through  January  18,  2008;  and  those \ncivil  clients  to  whom  they  may  be  appointed  through  January \n31,  2008;  and \n- 5 -\n\nb.  The  Offices  are  authorized  to  spend  those  state  or \ncounty  funds  that  are,  in  the  discretion  of  each  OCCCRC, \nnecessary  to  provide  effective  representation  to  those \nclients,  including  costs  associated  with  due  process, \nemployment,  furniture,  equipment,  and  office  supplies. \nHowever,  those  Respondents  remain  enjoined  from  hiring any  new \nemployees,  entering  into  any  new  leases,  expending  funds  for \nthe  purchase  of major  data  processing  or  computer  equipment  or \nentering  into  service  contracts  for  such  equipment  after \nJanuary  9,  2008. \nc.  This  Court  reserves  jurisdiction  to  consider  and \nresolve  any  requests  by  the  respective,  Respondents  Regional \nCounsel  for  specific  relief  from  the  injunction  as  it relates \nto  unique  circumstances. \nDONE  AND  ORDERED,  in  Chambers,  at  Tallahassee,  Leon  County, \n/I~ \nFlorida,  this  day  of  January,  2008. \nCircuit  Judge \n- 6-",

Respondents  are  Florida  state  public  officials  whom \nPeti tioner  claims  either  have  exercised  or  will  exercise  their \nrights  and  duties  in  a  manner  that  is  unconstitutional. \nII.  STATEMENT  OF  THE  FACTS \n6.  On  May  24,  2007,  Governor  Charlie  Crist  signed  into  law \nCS/SB  1088,  Ch.  2007-62,  Laws  of  Fla.  (Hereinafter  \"The  Act\") \n(Attached  hereto  in  redline  version  as  Appendix  B).  The  Act \nprovides  for  the  establishment  of  five  Offices  of  Criminal  Conflict \nand  Civil  Regional  Counsel  (hereinafter  \"OCCCRCs\")  to  handle  the \nlarge majority  of  the  criminal  conflict  cases  previously handled  by \nprivate  counsel,  as  well  as  to  represent  indigent  clients  in \ncertain  civil  proceedings.  (App.  B,  Preamble  at  1-3)  These  offices \nare  to  be  located  \"within  the  geographical  boundaries  of  each  of \nthe  five  district  courts  of  appeal.\"  (App.  B  at  6;  §  27.511(1), \nFla.  Stat.  (May  24,  2007)). \n7.  The  Act  requires  that  the  Governor  appoint  five  Criminal \nConflict  and  Civil  Regional  Counsel  (hereinafter  \"CCCRC\")  to  direct \nthe  OCCCRCs,  following  receipt  of  recommendations  for  candidates  by \nthe  Supreme  Court  Judicial  Nominating  Commission.  (App.  B  at  6;  §§ \n27.511(1),  (3),  Fla.  Stat.). \n8.  The  Act  further  requires  that  the  Florida  Senate  confirm \nthe  Governor's  appointments  for  them  to  take  effect.  (App.  B  at  7; \n§  27.511 (3),  Fla.  Stat.).  Pursuant  to  section  114.05 (b),  Florida \n3 \n\nStatutes,  the  Secretary of  State,  Respondent  Kurt  Browning,  first \nmust  submit  to  the  President  of  the  Senate,  Respondent  Ken  Pruitt, \na  certificate  of  appointment  and  completed  biographical \nquestionnaires  from  each  of  the  five  appointees.  The  Senate  must \nthen  vote  on  the  appointments  by  the  conclusion  of  the  next \nlegislative  session,  or  May  2008,  in  order  to  confirm  the \nappointments.  The  appointments  are,  however,  currently  valid \nwithout  any  further  action  by  the  Senate  until  such  vote. \n9.  Finally,  the  Act  amends  several  Florida  statutes  to \ninclude  in  the  definition  of  \"Public  Defender  Offices\"  these  new \nOCCCRCs.  See,  e.g.,  App.  B  at  29,  32;  §  29.008(1),  Fla.  Stat.  (May \n24,2007)  (\"[T]he  term  'public  defender  offices'  includes  the \noffices  of  criminal  conflict  and  civil  regional  counsel.\");  § \n29.001 (1),  Fla.  Stat.  (Ma y  24 ,  2007 )  (\"For  the  purposes  of \nimplementing  s.  14,  Art.  V  of  the  State  Constitution,  the \noffices  of  public  defenders  and  state  attorneys  are  defined  to \ninclude  the  enumerated  elements  of  the  20  state  attorneys'  offices \nand  the  enumerated  elements  of  the  20  public  defenders'  offices  and \nfive  offices  of  criminal  conflict  and  civil  regional \ncounsel.\") (emphasis  added) . \nIII.  NATURE  OF  THE  RELIEF  SOUGHT \n10.  Petitioner  Florida  Association  of  Criminal  npfpnsp \nLawyers,  Inc.,  respectfully  requests  that  this  Honorable  Court \nissue  a  writ  of  quo  warranto  to  provide  for  the  following: \n4 \n\nA.  Grant  oral  argument  on  the  issues  presented  herein \nand  expedite  these  proceedings  to  prevent  irreparable  harm  to  the \nparties;l \nB.  Declare  Ch.  2007-62,  Laws  of  Florida, \nunconstitutional  and  therefore  void  because  it violates  Article  V, \nsection  18  of  the  Florida  Constitution; \nC.  Quash  Respondent  Governor  Crist's  appointments  of \nRespondents  Jeffrey  Lewis,  Jackson  Flyte,.  Joseph  George,  Jr., \nPhilip Massa  and  Jeffrey  Dean  as  CCCRC  pursuant  to  The  Act; \nD.  Enj oin  Respondent  Kurt  S.  Browning,  Secretary  of \nState,  from  submitting  certificates  of  appointment  and  biographical \nquestionnaires  to  Respondent  Ken  Pruitt,  President  of  the  Florida \nSenate,  on  behalf  of  Respondents  Jeffrey  Lewis,  Jackson  Flyte, \nJoseph  George,  Jr.,  Philip  Massa  and  Jeffrey  Dean; \nE.  Enjoin  the  Senate,  through  Respondent  Senate \nPresident  Ken  Pruitt,  from  confirming  Respondents  Jeffrey  Lewis, \nJackson  Flyte,  Joseph  George,  Jr.,  Philip Massa  and  Jeffrey  Dean  as \nCCCRC  pursuant  to  The  Act;  and \nF.  Enj oin  Respondents  Jeffrey  Lewis,  Jackson  Flyte, \nJoseph  George,  Jr.,  Philip  Massa  and  Jeffrey  Dean  from  performing \nany  duties  under  The  Act. \nlpetitioner  has  filed  a  separate  Motion  for  Oral  Argument  and  to \nExpedite  Proceedings  simultaneously  with  this  Petition. \nS \n\nIV.  ARGUMENT  AND  CITATIONS  OF  AUTHORITY \nA.  The  CCCRCs  Are  Public  Defenders  and  Are  Therefore \nSubject  to  the  Requirements  of Article  V,  Section \n18  of  the  Florida  Constitution. \n11.  By  including  within  the  definition  of  \"public  defender \noffices\"  the  OCCCRCs,  the  legislature  has  made  clear  that  The  Act \nis  intended  to  establish  a  second  tier of  public  defender  offices \nto  handle  criminal  conflict  cases  where  a  conflict  of  interest \nwould  result  from  representation  by  the  first,  existing  tier. \n12.  This  intention  is  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  the \nlegislature  amended  section  29.001,  Florida  Statutes,  to  include \nthe  OCCCRCs  in  the  enumerated  elements  of  the  public  defender \noffices,  making  it  possible  to  require  the  counties  to  cover \nvarious  expenses  pertaining  to  the  infrastructure  of  the  new \noffices  pursuant  to  Article  V,  section  14  of  the  Florida \nConstitution.  Section  14  states,  in  pertinent  part, \n(a)  .  Funding  for  the  state  courts  system, \nstate  attorneys'  offices,  public  defenders' \noffices,  and  court-appointed  counsel,  except \nas  otherwise  provided  in  subsection  (c),  shall \nbe  provided  from  state  revenues  appropriated \nby  general  law. \n(c)  No  county  or  municipality,  except  as \nprovided  in  this  subsection,  shall  be  required \nto  provide  any  funding  for  the  state  courts \nsystem,  state  attorneys'  offices,  public \ndefenders'  offices,  court-appointed  ccun3el  or \nthe  offices  of  the  clerks  of  the  circuit  and \ncounty  courts  performing  court-related \nfunctions.  Counties  shall  be  required  to  fund \nthe  cost  of  communications  services,  existing \nradio  systems,  existing  mUlti-agency  criminal \n6 \n\njustice  information  systems,  and  the  cost  of \nconstruction  or  lease,  maintenance,  utilities, \nand  security  of  facilities  for  the  trial \ncourts,  public  defenders'  offices,  state \nattorneys'  offices,  and  the  offices  of  the \nclerks  of  the  circuit  and  county  courts \nperforming  court-related  functions. \n(Emphasis  added.) \n13.  Only  by  defining  the  OCCCRCs  as  public  defender  offices \ncould  the  legislature  save  money  on  the  new  offices  by  requiring \nthe  counties  to  pay  for  their  infrastructure.  Said  another  way, \nwere  the  OCCCRCs  not  public  defender  offices,  section  29.001(1) \nwould  violate  Article  V,  sections  14(a)  and  (c)  of  the \nConstitution. \n14.  Because  the  OCCCRCs  are  simply public  defender  offices  by \na  different  name,  they  and  their  directors  must  conform  to  the \nconstitutional  provision  addressing  such  offices,  namely Article  V, \nsection  18,  which  provides, \nIn  each  judicial  circuit  a  public  defender \nshall  be  elected  for  a  term  of  four  years,  who \nshall  perform  duties  prescribed  by  general \nlaw.  A  public  defender  shall  be  an  elector of \nthe  state  and  reside  in  the  territorial \njurisdiction  of  the  circuit  and  shall  be  and \nhave  been  a  member  of  the  Bar  of  Florida  for \nthe  preceding  five  years.  Publ ic  defenders \nshall  appoint  such  assistant  public  defenders \nas  may  be  authorized  by  law. \n(Emphasis  Because  The  P.ct  J-l _ _  CCCRC  be \nLUI::! \nappointed by  the  Governor  and  confirmed  by  the  Senate,  rather  than \nelected,  and  that  they  reside  within  the  geographic  boundaries  of \n7 \n\nthe  District  Courts  of Appeal,  rather  than  in  each  circuit,  The  Act \nis  in  violation  of  section  18. \n15.  Although  the  legislature  has  the  authority  to  require \nthat  public  defenders  \"perform  duties  prescribed  by  general  law\" \npursuant  to  Article  V,  section  18,  it  cannot  ignore  or  alter  the \naccompanying  constitutional  requirement  that  all  public  defenders \nbe  elected  and  reside  in  the  circuit  they  represent. \n16.  In  Bush  v.  Holmes,  919  So.  2d  392  (Fla.  2006),  this  Court \nheld  that  the  Constitution  is  a  limitation  upon,  not  a  grant  of, \nlegislative power.  Id.  at  406;  see  also  Chiles  v.  Phelps,  714  So. \n2d  453,  458  (Fla.  1998) (citing  Savage  v.  Board  of  Public \nInstruction,  133  So.  341,  344  (Fla.  1931)  for  the  proposition  that \n\"[t]he  Constitution  of  this  state  is  not  a  grant  of  power  to  the \nLegislature,  but  a  limitation  only  upon  legislative  power[.]\")). \nThe  Holmes  Court  further  explained  that: \nWhere  the  Constitution  expressly provides  the \nmanner  of  doing  a  thing,  it impliedly  forbids \nits  being  done  in  a  substantially  different \nmanner.  .  .. Therefore,  when  the  Constitution \nprescribes  the  manner  of  doing  an  act,  the \nmanner  prescribed  is  exclusive,  and  it  is \nbeyond  the  power  of  the  Legislature  to  enact  a \nstatute  that  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  the \nconstitutional  provision. \nId.  at  407  (citing Weinberger  v.  Board  of Public  Instruction,  112 \nSo.  253,  256  (Fla.  1927)). \n17.  The  Holmes  decision  reaffirmed  the  principle  that \nconstitutional  provisions  \"must  be  read  in  para  materia,  rather \n8 \n\nthan  as  distinct  and  unrelated obligations.\"  919  So.2d  at  406.  In \ndoing  so,  this  Court  declared  that  a  legislative  scheme  that \ngranted  educational  vouchers  for  students  to  attend  private  schools \nviolated  the  constitutional  requirement  that  free  education  be \nprovided  through  a  uniform  system of  public  schools.  While  noting \nthat  nothing  in  the  Constitution  prohibited educational  vouchers, \nthe  Court  determined  that  the  constitutional  requirement  that \npublic  education  be  provided  through  a  uniform  and  free  system was \na  constitutional mandate  with  a  restriction,  one  which  the  voucher \nprogram  violated.  Id.  at  407. \n18.  Like  the  constitutional  provision  considered  by  the \nHolmes  Court,  the  language  in  Article  V,  section  18  unambiguously \nmandates  that  public  defenders  be  elected,  and  further  requires \nthat  they  reside  in  each  judicial  circuit.  Having  prescribed  the \nterms  for  a  public  defender's  qualifications  to  hold  office,  there \nis  simply  no  manner  of  construing  the  constitutional  provision  to \nallow  for  a  second  tier of  unelected  public  defenders  in  separate \noffices  residing  not  in  the  circuits  but  within  the  jurisdictional \nboundaries  of  the  district  courts  of  appeal. \n19.  This  Court  has  consistently  invalidated  legislative \nschemes  in  derogation  of  the  principle  that  the  requirements  for \noffice  of  constitutional  officers  cannot  be  supplanted  by  the \nlegislature.  For  example,  in  Maloney  v.  Kirk,  212  So.2d  609  (Fla. \n1968),  the  Court  affirmed  a  lower  court's  decision  that  invalidated \n9 \n\na  statute  which  imposed  requirements  on  a  constitutional  officer \nbeyond  those  set  forth  in  the  Constitution.  In  a  specially \nconcurring  opinion,  Justice  Roberts  explained  that: \nWhen  the  Constitution  has  dealt  with  a  subject \nin  such  manner  as  to  clearly  indicate  that  it \nwas  the  intent  of  the  authors  that  the \ncoverage  be  complete,  the  legislature  is,  by \nimplication,  denied  the  power  to  take  from  or \nto  add  to  the  constitutional  provisions.  This \nrule  is  particularly  applicable  to  a \nspecification of  who  may  and  who  may  not  serve \nas  governor  if duly  chosen  by  the  people. \n212  So.  2d  at  611  (Roberts,  J.,  specially concurring).  See  also  In \nre  Investigation  of a  Circuit  Judge,  93  So.  2d  601,  606-08  (Fla. \n1957) (citing  Weinberger  and  finding  that  where  the  constitution \ncreates  an  office,  fixes  its  term,  and  provides  under  what \nconditions  the  officer  may  be  removed  before  expiration  of  term, \nneither  the  Legislature  nor  any  other  authority  has  the  power  to \nremove  or  suspend  such  officer  in  any  manner  other  than  that \nprovided  in  constitution) . \n20.  Similarly,  in  Askew v.  Thomas,  293  So.  2d  40  (Fla.  1974), \na  quo  warranto  proceeding,  the  Court  considered  a  constitutional \nquestion  involving  residency  requirements  to  hold  office,  and \nechoed  the  same  principles  that  Petitioner  contends  control  here: \nWe  have  consistently  held  that  statutes \nimposing  additional  qualifications  for  office \nare  unconstitutional  where  the  basic  document \nof  the  constitution  itself  has  already \nundertaken  to  set  forth  those  requirements. \nId.  at  42. \n10 \n\n21.  A  more  recent  example  is  found  in  this  Court's  decision \nin  Cook  v.  City  of Jacksonville,  823  So.  2d  86  (Fla.  2002).  In \nCook,  this  Court  invalidated  a  legislative  attempt  to  modify  the \nelection  requirements  of  constitutional  officers  by  imposing  term \nlimits.  In  doing  so,  the  Court  determined  that  the  constitutional \nprovision  that  specified which  constitutional  officers  were  subject \nto  term  limits  necessarily  preempted  the  field,  and  that  term \nlimits  imposed  on  additional  constitutional  officers  was  invalid. \n823  So.2d  at  93-94. \n22.  In  sum,  Article  V,  section  18  limits  the  field  of  public \ndefenders  to  those  who  are  elected  and  reside  in  each  judicial \ncircuit.  The  Act  therefore  violates  the  constitutional  restriction \nimposed  by  section  18  by  creating  a  second  tier  of  non-elected \npublic  defenders  within  the  jurisdiction of  each  District  Court  of \nAppeal. \nB.  The  Act  Violates  The  Policy  Considerations  that \nGave  Rise  to  the  Constitutional  Mandate  Discussed \nHerein. \n23.  In  addition  to  an  analysis  of  the  plain  language  of  the \nFlorida  Constitution  relevant  to  Petitioner's  claim,  it  is  also \nproper  for  this  Court  to  consider  the  primary  purpose  behind  the \nconstitutional  requirement  that  public  defenders  be  elected, \nHolmes,  919  So.2d  at  407-08;  namely,  to  insure  that  such  officers \nmaintain  independence  from  the  political  process  and  thereby \nprotect  the  Sixth Amendment  guarantee  to  the  effective  assistance \n11 \n\nof  counsel  in  criminal  cases  at  trial  and  on  direct  appeal. \n24.  In  State  v.  Brummer,  443  So.  2d  957,  959  (Fla.  1984), \nthis  Court  identified public  defenders  as  the  primary  guardians  of \nthis  Sixth  Amendment  right: \nThe  Office  of  the  Public  Defender  is  a \ncreature  of  the  state  constitution  and  of \nstatute,  not  of  the  common  law.  The  State  of \nFlorida,  in  order  to  meet  its  responsibility \nto  provide  the  assistance  of  counsel \nguaranteed  to  defendants  against  state  action \nby  the  sixth  amendment  of  the  United  States \nConsti tution,  made  applicable  to  states \nthrough  the  fourteenth  amendment,  has  created \nthis  office  in  article  V,  section  18  of  the \nFlorida  constitution. \n25.  Unlike  many  other  states,  Florida  has  placed  an \nexceptionally  high  premium  on  maintaining  the  independence  from \nstate  control  of  these  guardians,  as  articulated  in  Brummer: \nThe  United  States  opinion  in  Polk  County  v. \nDodson,  454  U.S.  312,  102  S.  ct.  445,  70  L. \nEd.  2d  509  (1981),  concisely  summari zes  this \nCourt's  view  concerning  the  primary  purpose  of \nthe  public  defender.  Quoting  from  Ferri  v. \nAckerman,  444  U.S.  193,  204,  100  S.  ct.  402, \n409,  62  L.  Ed.  2d  355  (1979),  the  Court  agreed \nthat  \"His  [the  public  defender's]  principal \nresponsibility  is  to  serve  the  undivided \ninterests  of  his  client.  Indeed,  an \nindispensable  element  of  the  effective \nperformance  of  his  responsibilities  is  the \nability to  act  independently  of  the  Government \nand  to  oppose  it  in  adversary  litigation.\" \n102  S.Ct.  at  450  n.8  (emphasis  supplied). \n426  So.2d  at  533. \n26.  This  premium  on  independence  is  given  voice  through  the \nFlorida  constitutional  requirement  that  public  defenders  be  elected \n12 \n\nby  the  citizens  of  the  state,  not  appointed  and  confirmed  by \nGovernment  officials.  Art.  V,  §  18,  Fla.  Const.  The  election  of \npublic  defenders  serves  to  prevent  the  inherent  conflict  that \nresul ts  when  an  attorney  charged  with  vigorously  defending  an \nindigent  person  against  the  state  in  a  criminal  prosecution  is \nnonetheless  subject  every  four  years  to  the  approval  of  that  very \ngovernment  through  the  actions  of  the  Governor  and  Senate. \n27.  To  be  sure,  where  existing  section  18  public  defenders \nhave  a  conflict  of  interest  in  representing  a  criminal  defendant, \nsome  other  person  or  entity  must  be  appointed  to  represent  that \nindividual.  That  person,  however,  must  be  able  to maintain  the  same \nlevel  of  independence  the  Constitution  requires  of  public \ndefenders.  Prior  to  the  enactment  of  The  Act,  such  conflict \nattorneys  were  appointed  by  the  independent  judiciary so  that  they \nwould  be  insulated  from  political  considerations  in  the \n2 \nrepresentation  of  their  clients.\n2Unlike  the  Executive  Branch,  the  Judiciary  has  the  inherent  power \nto  appoint  attorneys  to  represent  persons  charged  with  a  crime  to \n\"ensure  the  adequate  representation  of  the  criminally  accused.\" \nSee  Makemson  v.  Martin  County,  491  So.  2d  1109,  1112  (Fla.  1986). \nSee  also  State  v.  Ford,  626  So.  2d  1338,  1345  (Fla.  1993) ('''All \ncourts  in  Florida  possess  the  inherent  powers  to  do  all  things  that \nare  reasonable  and  necessary  for  the  administration  of  justice \nwithin  the  scope  of  their  jurisdiction,  subject  to  valid  existing \nlaws  and  constitutional  provisions.'\") (quoting  Roger  A.  Silver,  The \nInherent  PorA!er  of  the  Florida  Courts;  39  U.Miami  L.Re\".  257 ,  263 \n(1985));  State  ex  rel.  Harris  v.  McCauley,  297  So.  2d  825,  829 \n(Fla.  1974) (circuit  court  judge  was  not  constrained  by \nconstitutional  electoral  requirements  in  selecting  attorney  to \ntemporarily  fill  position  of  state  attorney  because  it possessed \nthe  inherent  power  to  do  so). \n13 \n\n28.  The  Act,  by  largely  eliminating  the  role  of  private, \ncourt-appointed  attorneys  for  criminal  conflict  cases3  and \nestablishing  second-tier  public  defender  offices  that  are  to  be \ndirected  by  appointed  officers,  wholly  undermines  the  independence \nthis  Court  has  deemed  critical  to  the  preservation  of  an  indigent \ndefendant's  Sixth Amendment  right  to  counsel.  If the  OCCCRCs  are  to \nbe  the  chosen  vehicle  for  handling  the  large  majority  of  criminal \nconflict  cases  in  Florida,  they  must  be  directed  by  elected \nofficials. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nf:l---\n~ \nslta \nRudenstine \nFlorida  Bar  No.  0711950 \n1221  N.

Because \nThe Act provides that the Regional Counsel be appointed by the Governor and \nconfirmed by the Senate, as well as that they reside within the geographic boundaries \nof the DCAs rather than in each circuit, The Act is in violation of Section 18. \nI respectfully request that you act upon this request and file the petition on an \nexpedited basis. The Act is rapidly precipitating a crisis in the delivery of competent \nlegal services to indigent Floridians who have been accused of crimes. It has become \nobvious to everyone within the criminal justice system that it simply will not work. \nBecause The Act requires that the OCCCRCs be established as early as \nOctober 1, 2007, but not later than January 1, 2008, time is of the essence. To avoid \nthe vast expenditure of limited state resources that would result if the offices were \nestablished and staff hired prior to this issue being resolved, I hope that you will \nprovide  me with  a  written  answer pertaining  to this  issue quickly,  so that our \nAssociation  may take independent action  if your office declines to pursue this \nimportant Constitutional issue.  I will contact your Chief of Staff, Mr. Joe Jacquot on \nor before Wednesday, September 19, 2007, to work with your office to establish a \nreasonable expedited deadline for your decision. \nSincere~_-7 \n/./{/ \nussell Smith, President \nFI  rida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers \n\nSTATE  OF  FLORIDA \nBILL MCCOLLUM \nATTORNBY GENBRAL \nSeptember 17, 2007 \nA.

It  is  clear, \nin  Florida  that  members  of  the  general  public  seeking \nenforcement  of  a  public  right  may  obtain  relief  through  quo \nwarranto.  Chiles  v.  Phelps,  714  So.  2d  453,  456  (Fla. \n1998) .  Peti t ioner  asserts  that  the  Respondents  have \nexercised,  or  will  exercise,  their  rights  and  duties  in  a \nmanner  which  contravenes  the  Florida  Constitution.  The \nr i ght  to  have  state officials  perform  their duties  and \nexercise  t heir  powers  in  conformity  with  the  Constitution \nmay  be  properly  enforced  in  quo  warranto  proceedings. \nMartinez  v.

Id.,  at \n1339.  Petitioner  has  legal  standing  in  this  controvercy. \nMoreover,  the  court  finds  that  quo  warranto  is  the \nproper  remedy  to  challenge  the  appointment  of  the  regional \ncounsel  respondents.  Austin  v.  State  ex  rei.  Christian, \n310  So.  2d  289  (Fla.  1975).  \"Quo  warranto  is  an \nappropriate  and  adequate  remedy  to  determine  the  right  of \nan  individual  to  hold  a  public  office. H  State  ex  reI. \nBooth  v.  Byington,  168  So.  2d  164,  175  (Fla.  1st  DCA  1964).' \nChapter  2007-62,  Laws  of  Florida,  provides  for  the \nestablishment  of  five  Offices  of  the  Criminal  Conflict  and \nCivil  Regional  Counsel  (MOCCCRCsH to  be  headed  by \n) \nappointed  counsel.  These  OCCCRCs  were  created  to  provide \ncriminal  representation  in  criminal  cases  where  the  public \ndefender  has  a  conflict  of  interest.  The  OCCCRCs  also  have \nprimary  responsibility  for  providing  representation  in \ncertain  civil proceedings.  Ch.  2007-62  §  4,  Laws  of \nFlorida.  Each  OCCCRC  is  located within  the  geograph~c \nboundaries  of  one  of  the  five  district  courts  of  appeal. \nrd .  The  five  regional  counsel  are  appointed  to  a  term  of \n, \nRespondents  urge  the  proper  remedy  is  a  Declaratory  Judgment;  and \nPetitioner mentioned  its availability during  the  hear.ing.  While \ndecl~ratory judgment  pursuant  to  Chapter  86,  Florida  Statutes may \nprovLde  an  alternative,  ~egal vehicle  tor  relief,  it wa!  not  sought  in \nthe  Petition  and  is  therefore  not  before  this  Court. \n3 \n\n12/20/2007  1G:53  8509220327  2ND  CIRCUIT  CT FL  PAGE  05/08 \nfour  years  by  the  governor  subject  to  confirmation  by  the \nFlorida  Senate.  Id. \nInitially,  it  should  be  noted  the  function  of  courts \nis  to  in\"erpret  the  law,  not  to  legislate.  The  court  is \nnot  concerned  with  the  wisdom  of  the  policy  of  legislation, \nso  long  as  such  legislation squares  with  the  constitution. \nHolley  v.  Adams,  238  So.  2d  401,  404  (Fla.  1970) . \nTherefore,  this  Cour\"  declines  to  address  any  issues \nregarding  the  public  policy  of  establishing  Offices  of \nCriminal  Conflict  and  Civil  Regional  Counsel. \nSimilarly,  this  Court  will  not  consider  the \nconstitutionality  of  the  funding  mechanism  presented  in \nthis  Legislation,  which  Petitioner  asserts  is  violative  Of \nArticle  V,  §  14  of  the  Florida  Constitution.  l \nThe  primary  issue  properly  before  this  Court  is \nwhether  Chapter  2007-62,  Laws  of  Florida  requires  the \nGovernor  and  the  Senate  to  exceed  their  constitutional \nauthority  by  appointing  and  confirming,  respectively,  the \nregional  counsel  respondents.  The  court  finds  that  it \ndoes. \n) Section  14  provide~,  in  pertinent  part,  that  funding  for.  \"public \ndefender  offices\"  inter alta,  \"shal.l  be  provided  from  State  reven\\,le\" \nf \n'ppropn .. ted by  general.  law.\"  (emphasis  supplied) .  The  legislation in \nquestion mandates  that  th15  species of  Public  Defender  be  funded  by  the \nvarious  county  government~. \n4 \n\n12/26/2667  lb:53  8569226327  2ND  CIRCUIT  CT FL  PAGE  6b/68 \nThe  cour~ agrees  with  Petitioner  ~hat ~he regional \ncounsel  respondents  are  essentially public  defenders  that \nhave  not  been  subject  to  the  qualifications  provided  by \nArticle  V,  Section  18  of  the  Florida  Constitution.  An \nexamination  of  Chapter  2007-62,  Laws  of  Florida,  reveals \nthat  the  Legislature  has  attempted  to  create  a  hybrid  state \noffice  that  is  a  public  defender  for  some  purposes',  such  as \nfunding;  but  is  not  a  public  defender  for  purposes  of \nArticle  V,  Section  18.  Accordingly,  the  court  finds  that \nChapter  2007-62,  Laws  of  Florida,  amounts  to  an  attempt  to \namend  the  Constitution  by  legislative  fiat.  The  Supreme \nCourt  of  Florida  has  explained  that  the  Constitution \n\"cannot  be  changed,  modified  or  amended  by  legislative  or \njudicial  fiat.  It  provides  within  itself the  only  method \nfor  i ts  amendment.\"  Cook  v.  City  of  Jacksonville,  823  So. \n2d  86,  94  (Fla.  2002) (citations  omitted) . \nFurthermore,  our  Supreme  Court  has  stated: \nWhere  the  Constitution  expressly  provides  the  manner \nof  doing  a  thing,  it impliedly  forbids  its  being  done \nin  a  substantially  different  manner.  Therefore, \nwhere  the  Constitution  prescribes  the  manner  of  doing \nan  act,  the  manner  prescribed  is  exclusive,  and  it  is \nbeyond  the  power  of  the  Legislature  to  enact  a  statute \nthat  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  the  constitutional \nprovision. \nBush  v.  Holmes,  919  So.  2d  392,  407  (Fla.  2006) . \n4Se£l  Section  29.008(1),  Florida  Statutes,  wh.ich  includes  the  offices of \ncriminal  conflict  and  civil  r@gional  counsel  in  the  definition  of \npublic  defenders. \n5 \n\n12/20/2087  1&:53  B509220327  2ND CIRCUIT CT FL  PAGE  07/0B \nTherefore,  Chapter  2007-62,  Laws  of  Florida,  cannot \nalter  the  constitutional  requirements  provided  by  Article \nv,  Section  19  of  the  Florida  Constitution.  Because  this \nprovision  requires  public  defenders  to  be  el ected  and \nreside  in  the  territorial  jurisdiction of  his  or.  her \nrespective  circuit,  the  court  finds  that  the  Governor  acted \noutside  his  constitutional  authority  by  appointing  the \nregional  conflict  counsel  respondents;  and  the  Senate  woul d \nexceed  its constitutional  authority by  confi rming  those \nappointments . \nBased  upon  this  legal  analysis  of  the  clear  and \nestablished  precedent  i n  Florida,  the  Petition  for  Writ  of \nQuo  Warranto  should  be  granted. \nAccordingly,  it  is  ORDERED  and  ADJUDGED  that: \n1.)
