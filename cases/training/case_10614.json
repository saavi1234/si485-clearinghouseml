Hill Correctional Facility in Thornton, Pennsylvania under a contract with Delaware County, Pennsylvania. The Plaintiffs were arrested and brought to the George W. Hill Correctional Facility where they were allegedly strip-searched without reasonable suspicion in front of other inmates pursuant to the Geo Group's blanket policy of strip-searching every pre-trial detainee that entered its facilities, regardless of the crime charged and without making a determination whether there was a reasonable suspicion that the detainee possessed weapons or contraband.  </p><p>The Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory, monetary, and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. Specifically, the Plaintiff's requested monetary damages for Fourth Amendment violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, declaratory judgment as to the Fourth Amendment violations, and preliminary and permanent injunctions as to the Fourth Amendment violations. Additionally, the Plaintiff's brought claims under state law for battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p><p>On May 2, 2008, the Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the Plaintiff's battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims. The Plaintiffs did not oppose the motion. On May 30, 2008, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Judge Jan E. Dubois) granted the Defendant's motion to dismiss. </p><p>On September 18, 2008, the Defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On March 25, 2009, the District Court (Judge Dubois) denied the Defendant's motion. Allison v. Geo Group, Inc., 611 F. Supp. 2d 433 (E.D.Pa. 2009)</p><p>On March 1, 2010 the parties reached a settlement agreement. The terms of the settlement provided that since January 31, 2008 the Defendant stopped strip-searching without reasonable suspicion, and the Defendant instituted new strip search policies that are constitutional. All officers and employees will have access and training regarding the Defendant's strip search policy. An injunction order to ensure the Defendant's compliance with the revised strip search policy will remain in force for eighteen months from the date of the final approval of the settlement. Additionally, the settlement entitled each class member to a share of the $2.999 million settlement.</p><p>The approved settlement class is described as follows: All persons who were placed into the custody of one or more of the Jails after being detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses, or other crimes that did not involve the possession or distribution of drugs, possession of weapons, crimes of violence, or felonies, who had no history of such charges, and did not behave in a manner at intake that would give intake officers reasonable suspicion that the inmate was carrying or concealing contraband, but were strip searched upon their admission into one or more of the Jails pursuant to Defendants' then existing strip search policy.  </p><p>The Class Period is from January 30, 2006 to January 30, 2008 for George W. Hill Correctional Facility, Frio County Detention Center, Dickens County Detention Center, Tri-County Detention Center, and Newton County Correctional Center, and from January 30, 2005 to January 30, 2008 for Guadalupe County Correctional Facility.</p><p>On October 22, 2010 the District Court (Judge Dubois) granted final approval regarding the settlement agreement.</p><p></p>",

Dubois \npursuant to this Court’s Order of March 2, 2010 in order for this Court to conduct a \nfinal fairness hearing to determine whether the proposed Settlement Agreement \nbetween the Parties is fair, reasonable and adequate, and to address Class \nCounsel’s application for an award of attorney’s fees and costs; and the Settlement \nClass Members being represented by Class Counsel and Defendant being \nrepresented by their attorney; AND THE COURT having read and considered the \nSettlement Agreement, the Notice Plan, and Memoranda of Law submitted by Class \nCounsel, having received evidence at the hearing, having heard arguments from \nClass Counsel and the Defendant, and having considered the submissions by Class \nMembers, now makes the following: \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 2 of 48\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1.  This action was commenced on January 30, 2008, as a putative class \naction. \n2.  After over a year of intensive litigation, including extensive discovery \nand motion practice, and as a result of intensive, arm’s length negotiations between \nClass Counsel and Defendant, including a settlement conference before former \nMagistrate Judge James K. Melinson, the Parties have reached accord with respect \nto a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class Members, in \nreturn for a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in this case against the \nDefendant (“Settlement Agreement”).  The resulting Settlement Agreement was \npreliminarily approved by the Court on March 2, 2010.  See Docket Entry No. 61. \n3.  As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court \napproved a proposed Notice Plan and Class Notice, which provided Settlement \nClass Members notice of the proposed Settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an \nopportunity for Class Members to file objections to the Settlement, and an \nopportunity to opt-out of the Settlement. \n4.  As of the July 1, 2010 deadline for the filing of objections, none were \nfiled.  Given the size of this Settlement, and the Notice Plan described above, this \nCourt finds that the non-existence of any objections is indicative of the fairness, \nreasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement with the Defendant. \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 3 of 48\n \n5.  The settling Parties have filed with the Court an affidavit from Ryanne \nCozzi of Gilardi & Co. (the Settlement Administrator), declaring that the mailing \nand publication of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan, has \nbeen completed. \n6.  The Court finds that the published radio notice, the mailed notices, the \nposted notices at the Jails GEO operates and appropriate probation and parole \noffices, and the website notice constitute the best practicable notice of the Fairness \nHearing, proposed Settlement, Class Counsel’s application for fees and expenses, \nsuch notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all members of the Class, \nand complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, the Constitution of the United States, the laws of Pennsylvania and any \nother applicable law. \n7.  Any persons who wished to be excluded from this action were provided \nan opportunity to “opt-out” pursuant to the Notice.  As of the deadline to do so, July \n1, 2010, only one person, Timothy Montgomery, has elected to opt out of the \nSettlement.   Mr. Montgomery shall not be bound by the Settlement Agreement or \nthe final judgment herein. \n8.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the:  Settlement, Settlement \nAgreement, Release contained within the Settlement Agreement, and the Final \nOrder and Judgment.  Settlement Class Members do not have a further opportunity \nto opt-out of this Action. \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 4 of 48\n \n9.  Any Class Member who did not timely file and serve an objection in \nwriting to the Settlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or \nto Class Counsel’s application for fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the \nprocedure set forth in the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting \nPreliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed to have waived any such objection \nby appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise. \n10.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of \nthe Settlement Agreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, \nreasonable and adequate compromise of the claims against the Defendant in this \ncase, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a \nnumber of factors which the Court has considered in affirming this Settlement, \nincluding: \na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nb.  This Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class Members \nnow, without further litigation, under circumstances where the liability issues are \nstill vigorously contested among the Parties to this litigation.  This Settlement \nprovides Class Members with a substantial monetary benefit and equitable relief. \nc.  This Settlement is clearly a product of hard-fought litigation between \nthe Parties, and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or Counsel \nfor the Defendant. \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 5 of 48\n \n11.  Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendant \ntheir application for reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses consistent with \nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel’s \nrequest and hereby _______________ the request. \n12.  The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is \nfair, a simplified process, and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain \njurisdiction to work out any unanticipated problems. \n13.  The parties agree that an injunction is appropriate to ensure that \nDefendant complies with its revised written strip search policies at the Jails, as set \nforth in the Settlement Agreement. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF \nFACT, THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS OF \nLAW: \n14.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Parties and the subject matter of \nthis proceeding. \n15.  Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \nfollowing Class is certified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll persons who were placed into the custody of one or more of the Jails \nafter being detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses, or other \ncrimes that did not involve the possession or distribution of drugs, \npossession of weapons, crimes of violence, or felonies, who had no \nhistory of such charges, and did not behave in a manner at intake that \nwould give intake officers reasonable suspicion that the inmate was \ncarrying or concealing contraband, but were strip searched upon their \nadmission into one or more of the Jails pursuant to Defendants’ then-\n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 6 of 48\n \nexisting strip search policy. Excluded from the class are Defendants \nand any and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, \nheirs, successors, employees or assignees.  The Class Period is from \nJanuary 30, 2006 to January 30, 2008 for George W. Hill Correctional \nFacility, Frio County Detention Center, Dickens County Detention \nCenter, Tri-County Detention Center, and Newton County Correctional \nCenter, and from January 30, 2005 to January 30, 2008 for Guadalupe \nCounty Correctional Facility. \n \n16.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the \nrequirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and \nthat a class action is an appropriate method for resolving the disputes in this \nlitigation.  All the prerequisites for class certification under Rule 23 are present.  \nThe Class Members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined.  Questions of \nlaw and fact common to all Class Members predominate over individual issues and \nshould be determined in one proceeding with respect to all Class members.  The \nClass Representatives claims are typical of those of the Class.  The Class action \nmechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating and resolving this \naction. \n17.  The Class Representatives, Penny Allison and Zoran Hocevar, are \nentitled to and are hereby awarded a payment of $2,500.00 each, in recognition of \nthe efforts they undertook in connection with this lawsuit.  All Class Members who \nhave made claims on the settlement are entitled to receive their pro rata share of \nthe Settlement fund, not to exceed $400.00, after administrative expenses, \nattorneys’ fees and expenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the fund. \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 7 of 48\n \n18.  Any unused monies will revert to The GEO Group, Inc. \n19.  Class Counsel are qualified, experienced, and have aggressively \nlitigated this case, thereby demonstrating their adequacy as counsel for the Class.  \nJoseph G. Sauder and Benjamin F. Johns of Chimicles & Tikellis LLP are hereby \nappointed as counsel for the Class. \n20.  The Court grants final approval of the Settlement Agreement, as being \nfair, reasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n21.  The Courts finds that the request for attorneys’ fees is reasonable. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF \nFACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED \nAND DECREED AS FOLLOWS: \n22.  The Parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed \nSettlement is GRANTED. \n23.  The Plaintiffs’ Motion for fees of $899,700.00 and expenses of $7,500.00 \nand the payment of incentive awards to each of the named plaintiffs in the amount \nof $2,500.00 each is _______________.   Plaintiffs’ counsel are hereby awarded $ \n__________________ in fees and $ _____________________ in expenses.   \n   23.  The Settlement Class Representatives, Penny Allison and Zoran \nHocevar, are entitled to and are hereby awarded a payment of $2,500.00 each in \nrecognition of the efforts they undertook in connection with this lawsuit, All Class \nMembers who have made claims on the Settlement are entitled to receive their pro \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 8 of 48\n \nrata share of the Settlement Fund, not to exceed $400.00, after administrative \nexpenses, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and incentive awards are deducted from the \nfund. \n24.  This Action and all claims against the settling Defendant are hereby \ndismissed with prejudice, but the Court shall retain exclusive and continuing \njurisdiction of the Action, all Parties, and Settlement Class Members, to interpret \nand enforce the terms, conditions and obligations of this Settlement Agreement. \n25.  All Class Members who have not timely filed an opt-out request are \nbarred and enjoined from commencing and/or prosecuting any claim or action \nagainst the Defendant, and any Class Member who has not timely filed a request to \nexclude themselves shall be enjoined from initiating and/or proceeding as a class \naction in any forum. \n26.  Pursuant to 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 4305(b)(10) – and upon application by \nany domestic relations agent within thirty (30) days of this Order – any monies due \nto class members under the terms of this settlement shall be offset by any \narrearages for child support obligations.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nDated:  __________________ \n   \n \n_____________________________ \nThe Honorable Jan E.

INTRODUCTION \nThe Settlement, which represents the culmination of over eighteen months of \nhighly contested litigation between the Parties, provides substantial benefits to \ncertain individuals who were strip searched upon admission to the six GEO Jails at \nissue in this case: the George W. Hill Correctional Facility; the Guadalupe County \nCorrectional Facility; the Frio County Detention Center; the Dickens County \nDetention Center; the Tri-County Detention Center; and the Newton County \nCorrectional Center (the “Jails”).3  See Amended Settlement Agreement dated \n                                                 \n[1] Plaintiffs and Defendants shall be collectively referred to herein as the “Parties.” \n \n[2] Separately, Plaintiffs’ Counsel will be filing a motion and supporting \nmemorandum of law in support of their request for attorneys’ fees, expenses, and \nincentive payments for the two named plaintiffs. The parties agreed that GEO has \nthe right to contest Plaintiffs’ counsel’s application for attorney fees and costs.  \nAmended Settlement Agreement (ECF No. 60-3) § III(D) at 11.  GEO will contest \nPlaintiffs’ counsel’s application for attorney fees. \n \n[3] Of the six Jails covered by the Settlement, GEO no longer operates the following \nfour: the George W. Hill Correctional Facility; the Dickens County Detention \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 13 of 48\n \nMarch 1, 2010 (the “Settlement”) (Docket Entry No. 60-3).  Plaintiffs allege that \nGEO violated the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and Class members by illegally \nstrip searching them in the absence of reasonable suspicion.  The Class is defined \nas: \nAll persons who were placed into the custody of one or more of the Jails \nafter being detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses, or other \ncrimes that did not involve the possession or distribution of drugs, \npossession of weapons, crimes of violence, or felonies, who had no \nhistory of such charges, and did not behave in a manner at intake that \nwould give intake officers reasonable suspicion that the inmate was \ncarrying or concealing contraband, but were strip searched upon their \nadmission into one or more of the Jails pursuant to Defendants’ then-\nexisting strip search policy. Excluded from the class are Defendants \nand any and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, \nheirs, successors, employees or assignees.  The Class Period is from \nJanuary 30, 2006 to January 30, 2008 for George W. Hill Correctional \nFacility, Frio County Detention Center, Dickens County Detention \nCenter, Tri-County Detention Center, and Newton County Correctional \nCenter, and from January 30, 2005 to January 30, 2008 for Guadalupe \nCounty Correctional Facility. \nSettlement at 2.4 \n  The Settlement creates a fund valued up to $2,999,000.00 for the benefit of \nClass members who were committed to one of the Jails during the class period.  See \nSettlement at §(I)(OO) (defining the “Settlement Amount” to be $2,999,000.00).  See \nalso, id. at § (I)(NN) (providing that the entire Settlement Amount is to be \n“earmarked for the sole purpose of this case, and will not be utilized for any other \npayments or purposes.”).  \n                                                                                                                                                             \nCenter; the Newton County Correctional Center; and the Tri-County Detention \nCenter. \n \n[4] The Class Period is longer at Guadalupe County Correction Facility because the \napplicable New Mexico Statute of limitations is longer (three years instead of two). \n  - 2 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 14 of 48\n \nThere is a tiered-structure to GEO’s obligation to pays into the Settlement \nFund.  The first $500,000 was paid into the fund to cover the costs of administration \nand claims.  Settlement at § III(B)(1).  The second contribution of $1,000,000 is to be \npaid after the close of the claims period.  Id. at § III(B)(2).1  The Third Contribution \nis isto be paid into the settlement fund if the amount of claims received exceeds the \namount of the Second Contribution; if the amount of the Second Contribution is \nexceeded by the amount of money necessary to pay the number of claims received, \nonly the amount of money necessary to pay those claims need be paid (not the entire \nThird Contribution).  Id. at § III(B)(3) (“In the event the amount of claims received: \n(a) do not exceed the amount of Second Contribution, GEO does not have to pay the \nThird Contribution into the Settlement Fund until it receives notice, if any, from \nthe Settlement Administrator that such contribution is needed to satisfy any claims; \nor (b) exceeds the amount of the Second Contribution but does not rise to the level of \nthe Third Contribution amount, GEO shall pay into the Settlement Fund an \namount of the Third Contribution identified by the Settlement Administrator as \nnecessary to satisfy the claims received.”).  However, the entire amounts of the \nSecond and Third Contributions were to be “set aside by GEO and earmarked for \n                                                 \n[1] The parties have mutually agreed to keep the Claims Period open longer than \nthe September 14, 2010 original claims date; all claims postmarked on or before \nSeptember 30, 2010 will be considered timely. \n \n  - 3 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 15 of 48\n \nthe sole purpose of funding the Settlement Fund, as needed.”  Id. at (III)(B)(2)-(3).  \nAny money that is unused reverts to GEO.  Id. at § III(C)(1).5 \n  As set forth in the Settlement, Class members who timely submitted a claim \nform will be entitled to a check in the amount of $400.00.  Id. at § (III)(C)(1).   \nHundreds of class members elected to participate in this aspect of the settlement \nand sent in timely claim forms.  Only one class member opt-ed out.  None objected.   \n  In addition to this benefit, the Settlement also provided substantial non-\nmonetary benefits to the Class.  Specifically, the settlement agreement expressly \nprovides that upon the filing of (and as a result of) this lawsuit, GEO “stopped strip \nsearching detainees admitted to the Jails without reasonable suspicion ….”  See \nSettlement at § (III)(A)(1).  This commitment to stop conducting blanket strip \nsearches remained in effect from the filing of this lawsuit in January of 2008 until \naround the time that the Third Circuit recently issued its decision in Florence, \ndiscussed infra.  \n  In short, the Parties respectfully submit that this Settlement is fair, \nadequate, and reasonable for the Class (particularly given the current state of the \nlaw after Florence), and that the requirements for final approval are satisfied.  \n \n \n                                                 \n[5] The reverter and the $400 per claim cap are material settlement terms.  \nSettlement Agreement § III(C)(1) (“Both the reverter and the $400 per claim cap are \ncritical, essential and nonnegotiable terms of the settlement, and that \nnonacceptance of theses terms makes this agreement null and void, unless both \nparties agree to any changes in a signed writing.”). \n  - 4 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 16 of 48\n \nII.   BACKGROUND \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Allegations and GEO’s Defenses. \nOn January 30, 2008, Plaintiffs filed this putative class action lawsuit \nagainst GEO challenging its alleged practice of strip searching all arrestees \nregardless of crime, and regardless of whether the officers at intake had reasonable \nsuspicion justifying a search.   Plaintiffs allege that GEO maintained an \nunconstitutional strip search policy and practice throughout the class period by \nmaintaining a strip-search policy whereby it conducted visual strip searches on all \npretrial detainees upon their admission to the Jails in the absence of reasonable \nsuspicion, including those charged with misdemeanor offenses or other minor \ncrimes (referred to as a “blanket” strip search).   \nGEO denies that it had a blanket strip search policy, and contends that \npretrial detainees were only strip searched when reasonable suspicion existed.  \nGEO further contends that it only conducted strip searches where appropriate, and \nthat to the extent that any practice of strip searching all pretrial detainees existed, \nit was a result of the decision-making of the county or governmental units for which \nGEO operated Jails, and was contrary to GEO’s own written Corporate Policy.  All \npretrial detainees who entered the jails were going to inter-mingle with the general \npopulation.  GEO’s sole purpose in strip searching any detainee was to prevent \ncontraband from entering the general population (including drugs, weapons and \nmoney).  GEO contends to have had a long history of recovering contraband in the \njails via intake strip searches. \n  - 5 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 17 of 48\n \nIn response to Plaintiffs’ lawsuit, to the extent any jail had a strip search \npractice of permitting strip searches with less than reasonable suspicion, GEO \nimmediately took steps to effectively implement all of the injunctive relief Plaintiffs \nsought in the Complaint.  Specifically, GEO, through its outside counsel Reed \nSmith, LLP, immediately launched an extensive investigation into what strip \nsearch practices were employed at each of the potentially affected Jails.  As a result \nof this investigation, GEO took steps to recommit to its Corporate Policy to ensure \nthat all Jails employed a policy that no person detained for misdemeanors, \nsummary offenses, or other crimes that did not involve the possession or \ndistribution of drugs, possession of weapons, crimes of violence, or felonies, who had \nno history of such charges, and did not behave in a manner at intake that would \ngive intake officers reasonable suspicion that the inmate was carrying or concealing \ncontraband, was strip searched upon their admission to the Jails.  GEO also \nimplemented a strip search checklist (or “log”) for use at each Jail, which is now \ncompleted by intake personnel for each detainee.  Detainees are only strip searched \nafter that checklist or log is filled out, and only if the checklist or log permits a strip \nsearch under Plaintiffs’ understanding of the law – i.e., only if the checklist or log \nprovides reasonable suspicion.  GEO ensured that all intake personnel and all \nsupervisory employees were affirmatively made aware of these requirements, and \nensured that new employees would be trained on these procedures before working \nat intake. \n \n  - 6 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 18 of 48\n \nB.  History of the Litigation. \nAfter the Amended Complaint in this action was filed on March 28, 2008, a \nnew en banc decision was issued by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Powell v. \nBarrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc), which GEO contends \nmarkedly changed the landscape of strip search litigation by calling into question \ndecades of appellate interpretation of the seminal case of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. \n520, 559 (1979).  As a result of Powell, GEO filed a Motion for Judgment on the \nPleadings, which required extensive briefing by the Parties.  See Docket Entry Nos. \n29, 35, 37, 39, and 40. \nOn March 25, 2009, this Court issued a memorandum and order that denied \nGEO’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. See Docket Entry No. 41.  Shortly \nthereafter, GEO moved for certification for immediate appellate review pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. §1292(b) (the “1292(b) Motion”), which was opposed by Plaintiffs and also \nrequired extensive and complicated briefing.   See id. at Nos. 43, 44, 48, 49.  While \nthe § 1292(b) Motion was pending, the parties entered into settlement negotiations. \nIn addition to this and other motion practice before the Court, the Parties \nhave engaged in discovery over the course of this litigation.6  This included serving \nand responding to interrogatories and document requests.  The parties also \nexchanged initial disclosures pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 26(a).  GEO gathered and \nproduced over 1,200 pages of documents to Plaintiffs, which were reviewed and \nanalyzed by their counsel.  Plaintiffs’ counsel also provided counsel for GEO with \n                                                 \n[6] On October 7, 2008, the Court issued an order that, inter alia, granted in part \nand denied in part GEO’s motion for a stay of discovery.  See Docket Entry No. 33.   \n  - 7 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 19 of 48\n \nresponsive documents.  In addition, Plaintiffs’ counsel contend that they engaged in \na substantial amount of informal discovery and fact gathering.   \nC.  Settlement Negotiations. \n  While GEO’s 1292(b) Motion was pending before this Court, the Parties \nentered into settlement negotiations in the late spring of 2009, with the help of \nretired Magistrate Judge James R. Melinson.  The Parties met for a day-long \nmediation session conducted by Judge Melinson and continued negotiations \nafterwards, conferring by telephone on an almost daily basis.  After continuing to \nnegotiate for over a month, the Parties ultimately reached a preliminary agreement \nto settle on July 17, 2009.  The Parties then spent several months memorializing \nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement, preparing for the administration of the \nSettlement, and drafting the Class Notice that is attached to the Settlement \nAgreement.   \nAlthough these lengthy and complex negotiations have been difficult and \ntime consuming, the Parties’ good-faith efforts to resolve this Litigation ultimately \nresulted in an arm’s-length Settlement representing a thoughtful compromise.  The \nSettlement takes into consideration the Plaintiffs’ concerns regarding their alleged \nconstitutional violations, the Defendant’s prison security concerns, as well as the \nParties’ respective positions regarding the viability of Plaintiffs’ claims.   \nD.  Recent Developments in the State of the Law on Blanket Strip \n  Searches. \n \n  As noted above, during the pendency of this case, the Eleventh Circuit issued \nits en banc decision in Powell, 541 F.3d at 1298. At the time of the settlement \n  - 8 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 20 of 48\n \nnegotiations, the parties were also aware that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nhad ordered en banc consideration of Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, a \nstrip search case presenting similar issues.  On February 9, 2010, the Ninth Circuit, \n7-4, upheld San Francisco’s strip search policy, permitting strip searches of all \npretrial detainees without individualized reasonable suspicion. Bull v. City & \nCounty of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010)  (en banc).   \n  On September 21, 2010, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (which had not \npreviously addressed the issue) issued a precedential opinion which held that the \nconstitution does not forbid jails from conducting blanket strip searches, in the \nabsence of reasonable suspicion, of all newly admitted pretrial detainees, including \nthose arrested only for minor offenses.  Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of \nthe County of Burlington, ___ F.3d ___, No. 09-3661, 2010 WL 3633178 at *13 (3d \nCir. Sept. 21, 2010).7  The Third Circuit “rejected Plaintiffs’ argument that blanket \nstrip searches are unreasonable because jails have little interest in strip-searching \narrestees charges with non-indictable offenses.”  Id. at *10.  Indeed, the majority \nopinion reached this conclusion notwithstanding the plaintiffs’ argument that the \njails did not put forth any evidence of a past smuggling problem or of a single new \npretrial detainee who attempted to conceal contraband.  See Florence, 2010 WL \n3633178 at 30 (“[O]ur interpretation of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bell leads \n                                                 \n[7] Even before the issuance of Florence, infra, both Judge McLoughlin and Judge \nDiamond recognized this uncertainty in the law on the state of strip searches in \nrecent decisions granting final approval to class action settlements challenging \nblanket searches.   Boone v. City of Philadelphia, 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 704-05, 710 \n(E.D. Pa. 2009) (McLaughlin, J.); Kurian v. County of Lancaster, E.D. Pa. No. 07-cv-\n03482, at 9-10, 12 (E.D. Pa Apr. 9, 2010) (unpublished) (ECF No. 68). \n  - 9 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 21 of 48\n \nus to conclude that the Jails are not required to produce such a record.”).  Judge \nPollak filed a dissenting opinion. \n  Thus, the legal landscape has changed dramatically since the settlement in \nthis case was reached.  Were litigation still proceeding, GEO would file, and this \nCourt would likely grant, a motion for judgment on the pleadings to dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ claims based on Florence.  In light of the sea change occurring in this \narea, this settlement could, then, represent for the near future one of the last strip \nsearch settlements negotiated within at least the Third, Ninth, and Eleventh \nCircuits. \n  E.  Benefits Created by the Settlement.  \n   The Settlement Agreement provides for the creation of a Settlement Fund to \ncompensate the Class for these alleged constitutional violations, and provides class \nmembers with certain non-monetary benefits.  \n1.   The Monetary Benefit Created. \nThe Settlement creates a Settlement Fund valued up to $2,999,000.00, tiered \nin three contributions.  See Settlement at §§ (I)(OO) and (III)(B).  Class members \nwere eligible to receive a pro rata share of the Settlement Fund, up to a maximum \nrecovery of $400.00 each.8   Id. at § (III)(C)(1).  These payments to Class members, \nas well as administrative expenses (including the costs of settlement \nadministration, website administration and the provision of notice to class \n                                                 \n[8] Based on the number of timely claims submitted by Class members, each eligible \nClass member will receive $400.00, the maximum amount permissible under the \nSettlement.     \n  - 10 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 22 of 48\n \nmembers), and the amount awarded by the Court for attorneys’ fees and costs and \nincentive awards to the Class Representatives, will be deducted from the \nSettlement Fund.  In the event that there is any money remaining in the \nSettlement Fund after these deductions, the unused portion of the Settlement Fund \nwill revert to GEO.  Id.  In the event that the number of claims received does not \nrequire payment of all of part of the Third Contribution, GEO does not need to \nmake the Third Contribution.9  Id. at § III(B)(3).  Both the reverter and the $400 per \nclaim cap are critical and essential terms of the settlement, and are non-negotiable \nterms by GEO.10 \n    2.   The Non-Monetary Benefits.   \nGEO agreed to all of the class injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs.  \nSpecifically – and as a result of this lawsuit – GEO agreed to ensure that all Jails \nsubject to the Settlement Agreement did not conduct blanket strip searches of \npeople detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses, or other crimes that did not \ninvolve the possession or distribution of drugs, possession of weapons, crimes of \nviolence, or felonies, who had no history of such charges, and did not behave in a \nmanner at intake that would give intake officers reasonable suspicion, be strip \nsearched upon intake at the Jails.  And while the prospective injunctive relief in the \n                                                 \n[9]  However, as noted above the Settlement provides that the entire amount of the \nThird Contribution ”shall be set aside by GEO and earmarked for the sole purpose \nof funding the Settlement Fund, as needed.”  See Settlement at § (III)(B)(3).  \n \n[10] The creation of this Settlement Fund – and extent to which its proceeds will be \ndistributed to Class members who timely submitted valid claim forms – is not \naffected by the recently issued Florence decision.  \n  - 11 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 23 of 48\n \nsettlement will not be enforceable so long as Florence remains the controlling law in \nthe Third Circuit,11 the settlement created value for a thirty-two (32) month period \nby virtue of GEO’s commitment to cease blanket strip searches during this period.   \nF.  Implementation and Administration of the Settlement.  \nPromptly after the Court’s March 2, 2010 order granting preliminary \napproval to the Settlement, the parties began providing the Class Members with \nnotice, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement.  In response, 594 class members \nsubmitted timely claim forms to the settlement administrator.  \n1.   Class Notice and Settlement Administration. \n  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Court-approved notice was \nmailed to the last known or readily ascertainable mailing addresses for the 6,551 \npotential Class Members where address information could reasonably be obtained.12  \nThe notice was also provided to the Class by posting notices at each of the Jails \nGEO currently operates, and the probation and parole offices in the relevant \ngeographic areas.  In addition, the Settlement Administrator, Gilardi & Co., LLC, \ncaused an announcement of the Settlement on the radio stations KLEY in San \n                                                 \n[11] Should the Third Circuit’s 2-1 Florence decision be reversed by an en banc panel \nand/or by the Supreme Court of the United States, the prospective injunction in the \nsettlement will be reinstated by operation of law.  Plaintiffs note that the en banc \npanels of both the Eleventh and Ninth Circuits have granted reviews of Powell and \nBull, respectively.  \n[12] Of the 6,551 addresses of potential Class Members on the Mailing List to whom \nnotice was mailed, 2,211 notices were returned as undeliverable from the initial \nmailing.  See Cozzi Declaration at ¶ 6.  Through a third party locator service, \nGilardi has performed address searches for these potential class members and was \nable to find updated addresses for 1,048 class members. Id.  A total of 4,076 Notice \nPackets that were mailed were not returned as undeliverable.

See Declaration of Ryanne Cozzi at ¶ 8 (Ex. 1).    The radio notice \nwas broadcasted a total of 454 times throughout these 11 markets.  Id.  \nThe Settlement Administrator established a website where Settlement Class \nMembers could (and still can) obtain information and Claim Forms,13  and maintain \na toll-free number for use by Class Members.  The Settlement Website made claim \nforms and notice available in both Spanish and English.  The Settlement Website \nwas visited by 3,110 unique visitors. See Cozzi Decl. at ¶ 4.  The Settlement \nAdministrator has also received 222 calls from potential Class Members inquiring \nabout the settlement.  Id. at ¶ 3.  In addition to the mass mailing that occurred on \nMay 17, 2010, the Settlement Administrator has sent 213 claim forms to class \nmembers that called to request one.  Id. at ¶ 9. \n  News of the settlement also received media coverage in several regional \nmarkets, including the greater Philadelphia, San Antonio, Southern Illinois, and \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico areas.

While this third-party \nnews coverage was not expressly contemplated in the Settlement or preliminary \napproval order, it is additional evidence that that Class members were provided \n                                                 \n[13] See http://www.multistatestripsearchsettlement.com/casedocs.html. \n  - 13 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 25 of 48\n \nwith constitutionally adequate notice of the Settlement.  See Krell v. Prudential Ins. \nCo. of Am. (In Re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions), 148 \nF.3d 283, 327 (3d Cir. 1998); Wilson v. Airborne, Inc., No. 07-770, 2008 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 110411, at *13 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2008) (“[T]hough it was not part of the \nplan for disseminating notice, initial media coverage of the settlement agreement \nprovided additional opportunities for class members to learn about the \nsettlement.”). \n  2.  Response by Class Members. \nNot a single class member has objected to the Settlement, and only one class \nmember elected to opt-out.  The correspondence received by this class member who \nopted-out does not express any displeasure about the merits, substance, or fairness \nof the Settlement.  See Exhibit B of the Cozzi Decl.  Indeed, it does not set forth any \nreason why this particular person wishes to be excluded.   \nAs of September 21, 2010, a total of 594 class members have filed timely \nclaim forms, and 4 late claim forms have been filed.1314   The participation rate of \nthe class members who received the 4,076 notices that were returned as \nundeliverable) was 14.5%.15  According to the claims administrator’s experience \nfrom work on other class action settlements, these figures are comparable to that \nseen in similar cases.  See Cozzi Decl. at ¶ 12. \n                                                 \n[14] The parties have agreed that these and any late claims received which are post \nmarked by September 30, 2010 will be included, and any claims post marked after \nthat date will not be.  \n \n[15] There were 6,551 notices in total sent to potential Class members.  Of those, \n2475 were returned as undeliverable.  \n  - 14 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 26 of 48\n \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nThe Third Circuit requires that before a class action settlement agreement is \napproved, the district court must find that the settlement is fair, reasonable and \nadequate under FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e).  See Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153 (3d Cir. \n1975).  The district court must also find that the class meets the requirements for \ncertification set forth in FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a) and 23(b).  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d \nat 705.  A district court’s determination of whether the Rule 23(a) and 23(b) \nrequirements are met is subject to its discretion.  See Sullivan v. DB Investments, \nInc., No. 08-2784, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 14375, at *18 (3d Cir. Jul. 13, 2010) (citing \nIn re Schering Plough Corp. ERISA Litig., 589 F.3d 585, 595 (3d Cir. 2009)).   \nWhere – as here – the Court has already preliminarily approved the settlement, “an \ninitial presumption of fairness” is established.1416  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., \n321 F. Supp. 2d 619, 628 (E.D.Pa. 2004) (DuBois, J.) (quoting In re Gen. Motors \nCorp., 55 F.3d at 768, 785 (3d Cir. 1995)). \nAs set forth below, the Parties’ Settlement Agreement meets the requisite \ncriteria for final approval.  It should therefore be granted, the Settlement Class \nshould be certified, and this case should be dismissed with prejudice.  \n  A.   Certification of the Proposed Settlement Class is Appropriate to  \n   Resolve All Strip-Search Claims Against Defendants. \n  \nTo certify a class under Rule 23, the Court must find that all of the \nrequirements of Rule 23(a) are met, as well as at least one part of Rule 23(b).  See \n                                                 \n[16] On March 2, 2010, the Court in this case issued an order granting preliminary \napproval to the Settlement.  See Docket Entry No. 61. \n  - 15 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 27 of 48\n \nBoone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 705 (citing Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 55 (3d Cir. \n1994)).  The Settlement Class readily satisfy these requirements.17  It consists of \nthousands of individuals, hundreds of whom have elected to receive the monetary \nbenefits of the Settlement.  The claims of the class representatives and the \nsettlement class are typical because they are based on the same challenges to the \nsame conduct by the Defendants, and both the named plaintiffs and their counsel \nare adequate representatives.  There are several factual and legal questions that \nare common to the Class, which predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual members.  Finally, a class action is the superior method for fairly and \nefficiently adjudicating this controversy.   Other courts that have addressed blanket \nstrip search policies or practices have consistently recognized the propriety of \ncertifying such cases as class actions, and granting approval to class action \nsettlements. See e.g., Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 708.  See also, Florence v. Board of \nChosen Freeholders, 05-3619, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152, at *48 (D.N.J., Mar. 20, \n2008).  \n       1.  Numerosity Under Rule 23(a)(1). \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the Class be “so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.”   FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1).  The numerosity requirement \nwill generally be satisfied if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential \n                                                 \n[17] Defendant agrees to certification of a class for settlement purposes only; if this \nsettlement is not approved, Defendant retains all rights to challenge certification of \na litigation class. \n  - 16 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 28 of 48\n \nnumber of Plaintiffs exceeds forty (40).  See Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226-\n27 (3d Cir. 2001). \nThe Class here consists of thousands of geographically dispersed Class \nmembers, hundreds of whom have submitted claim forms.   Thus, numerosity is \nreadily satisfied in this case.  See, e.g., Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 705 (numerosity \nmet in strip search class action against City of Philadelphia involving thousands of \nclass members).   \n      2.    Commonality Under Rule 23(a)(2). \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the \nClass.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(2).  The commonality requirement is met if Plaintiffs’ \ngrievances share a common question of law or of fact.  See Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56. \n“It is well-established in the Third Circuit that commonality does not require all \nclaims and facts among class members be identical, rather a single common issue of \nlaw or fact shared by the named plaintiffs and the prospective class will suffice.” \nClarke v. Lane, 267 F.R.D. 180, 196 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (citations omitted).  A party is \nentitled to certification where the Class claims arise “from a common nucleus of \noperative fact’ regardless of whether the underlying facts fluctuate over the Class \nperiod and vary as to individual claimants.” In re Asbestos Sch. Litig., 104 F.R.D. \n422, 429 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (citations omitted).   \nApplying these principles, it is clear that the commonality requirement of \nRule 23(a)(2) is easily met here.  The central issues posed by this litigation are \nwhether the GEO-run Jails had a blanket strip-search policy and/or practice during \n  - 17 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 29 of 48\n \nthe Class period, and whether such a practice or policy is constitutional. See \nKurian, E.D. Pa. No. 07-CV-03482 at 5 (ECF No. 68) (finding commonality satisfied \nbased on similar constitutional challenges to a prison’s strip search practices).  The \nPlaintiffs both assert a common claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for GEO’s \nalleged violation of the constitution.  Given these common questions central to the \nlitigation, Rule 23(a)(2)’s requirement for the existence of common questions of fact \nor law has been met here.  See id.  See also, Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 706; Florence, \n2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152, at *21.   \n     3.   Typicality Under Rule 23(a)(3). \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that a representative plaintiff’s claims be “typical” of \nthose of other Class members.  The commonality and typicality requirements of \nRule 23(a) “tend to merge.” Gen. Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 \nn.13 (1982).  The requirement of typicality, along with the adequacy of \nrepresentation requirement set forth in Rule 23(a)(4), are designed to assure that \nthe interests of unnamed Class members will be protected adequately by the named \nClass representative. Id.  The typicality requirement “is satisfied when each Class \nmember’s claim arises from the same course of events, and each Class member \nmakes similar legal arguments to prove the Defendant’s liability.” Marisol A. v. \nGiuliani, 126 F.3d 372 (2d Cir. 1997).   \nHere, the claims of named Plaintiffs Penny Alison and Zoran Hocevar are \ntypical of the claims of the Settlement Class.  Their claims arise from the same \ncourse of events, and both would have to make the same arguments as the Class in \n  - 18 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 30 of 48\n \nchallenging the constitutionality of Defendants’ strip search practices.  As such, \ntypicality as readily satisfied here.  See Florence, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152, at \n*25. \n      4.    Adequacy Under Rule 23(a)(4). \nThe final requirement of Rule 23(a) is set forth in subsection 23(a)(4), which \nrequires that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the Class.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(4).   The Third Circuit has consistently \nruled that:  \nAdequate representation depends on two factors: (a) the \nPlaintiff’s  attorney  must  be  qualified,  experienced  and \ngenerally able to conduct the proposed litigation; and (b) \nthe Plaintiff must not have interests antagonistic to those \nof the Class.  \n \nWeiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786, 811 (3d Cir. 1984) (quoting Wetzel v.Liberty \nMutual Ins. Co., 508 F.2d 239, 247 (3d Cir. 1975)). \nThese two components are designed to ensure that absentee Class members’ \ninterests are fully and adequately pursued.  The existence of the elements of \nadequate representation are presumed, and “the burden is on the Defendant to \ndemonstrate that the representation will be inadequate.” Asbestos School \nLitigation, 104 F.R.D. at 430 (citing Lewis v. Curtis, 671 F.2d 779 (3d Cir. 1982)). \nRepresentative Plaintiffs and Class Counsel have fairly and adequately \nrepresented the Settlement Class here, especially judging by the excellent \nsettlement achieved in this litigation. With respect to the issue of adequacy of \ncounsel, the Class is represented by competent and experienced counsel who are \n  - 19 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 31 of 48\n \nexperienced in civil rights and class action litigation, and who have invested time \nand resources into the prosecution of this action.  See Kurian, E.D. Pa. No. 07-cv-\n03482, at 6 (ECF No. 68) (describing class counsel in that case – many of whom are \nthe same plaintiffs’ lawyers in this case – as “especially talented lawyers” who are \n“vastly experienced in class action litigation” and “are more than capable of \nrepresenting the Class.”).   \nAs to the second issue, there is nothing to suggest that the named Plaintiffs \nhave interests antagonistic to those of the absent Class members.  See Beck v. \nMaximus, Inc., 457 F.3d 291, 296 (3d Cir. 2006) (adequacy “assures that the named \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not antagonistic to the Class”). See also, Florence, 2008 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 22152, at *31.  The named Plaintiffs sought to bring an end to allegedly \nillegal strip-searches at the Jails, and are committed to obtaining appropriate \ncompensation from Defendants for themselves and for the members of the proposed \nClass.  The named Plaintiffs have come forward to represent the Settlement Class \nunder great personal pressure – being subject to an event that some consider \nhumiliating and would be difficult to recall on a regular basis for litigation \npurposes.  Adequacy is therefore met in this case. \n5.  The Requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) Are Met. \n \nThe proposed Class also satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) of the  \n \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under this rule, a class action may be maintained  \n \nif:  \n \nthe court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the \nmembers of the Class predominate over any questions affecting only \n  - 20 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 32 of 48\n \nindividual members, and that a Class action is superior to other \navailable methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the \ncontroversy.  \n \nFED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3).  The Rule 23(b)(3) analysis is commonly broken down into a \n“predominance” part and a “superiority” part.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 707 \n(citing In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d 241 (3d Cir. 2009)).  As \ndiscussed below, both parts of the test are met here. \n      a.  Predominance.   \n \n“The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed Classes are \nsufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.” Amchem, 521 U. S. \nat 623.  Although Rule 23(b)(3) requires that common issues of law and fact \npredominate, it does not require that there be an absence of any individual issues.  \nSee In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litig., 73 F.R.D. 322, 344 (E.D. Pa. 1976). The \nCourt must find that “the group for which certification is sought seeks to remedy a \ncommon legal grievance.” Hochschuler v. G.D. Searle & Co., 82 F.R.D. 339, 348-49 \n(N.D. Ill. 1978); Dietrich, 192 F.R.D. at 119 (in determining whether common issues \nof fact predominate, “a court’s inquiry is directed primarily toward whether the \nissue of liability is common to members of the Class”).  Rule 23(b)(3) does not \nrequire that all questions of law or fact be common. See In re Telectronics Pacing \nSystems, 172 F.R.D. 271, 287-88 (S.D. Ohio 1997).  \nHere, the proposed Settlement Classes’ claims involve one central question: \nwas GEO’s alleged practice of strip-searching every pretrial detainee admitted to \nthe Jails constitutional when conducted without regard to the crime charged or the \n  - 21 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 33 of 48\n \ncircumstances of arrest?  Proof of this issue would have been the undoubted focus of \nany trial,18 and would predominate over any of the Plaintiffs’ individual issues.  See \nFlorence, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152 at *36.19  As a result, “[n]umerous courts \nhave found Rule 23(b)’s predominance requirement satisfied in actions similar to \nthe instant matter, reasoning that the issues respecting the existance and \nconstitutionality of strip searching policies or practices are common to the class and \nsubject to generalized proof.”  Kurian, E.D. Pa. No. 07-CV-03482 at 6 (ECF No. 68) \n(citations omitted).   General evidence of the Defendants’ policy and its blanket \napplication to Class members will be required to prove their claims.  See Boone, 668 \nF. Supp. 2d at 708.  Accordingly, predominance is met.   \n  b.  Superiority.  \nThe relevant inquiry for the superiority determination is whether a class \naction, rather than individual litigation, is the best method for achieving a fair and \nefficient adjudication.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 708 (citing Newton v. Merrill \nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154 (3d Cir. 2001)).   FED. R. CIV. P.  \n23(b)(3) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors to aid the Court in determining \nwhether a class action is the superior method of adjudication: \n(A) the class members’ interests in individually controlling the \nprosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of \n                                                 \n[18] Defendant agrees to certification of a class for settlement purposes only; if this \nsettlement is not approved, Defendant retains all rights to challenge certification of \na litigation class. \n \n[19] The Third Circuit recently ruled that this single question has a single answer—\nan unqualified yes, GEO’s practices (to the extent any blanket strip search practice \nexisted) were, in fact, constitutional. \n  - 22 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 34 of 48\n \nany litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against \nclass members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating \nthe litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely \ndifficulties in managing a class action.20 \n \nGiven the nature of this action and the fact that a substantial proportion of \nthe Class membership is comprised of economically disenfranchised individuals, a \nclass action is also the superior method by which to adjudicate claims of individual \nClass members.  See Florence, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152 at *41 (superiority \nfound in strip search class action).  In the absence of this class action settlement, \nClass members may not have even been aware that the Defendants allegedly \nviolated their constitutional rights, much less actually pursue those claims.  See In \nre Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 229 (2d Cir. 2006).  Indeed, \npoor and marginalized Class members are unlikely to be able to litigate their cases \nindividually, particularly given the relatively small amounts of their potential \nindividual recovery in such a case. See Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 25; D’Alauro v. GC \nServices Ltd, 168 F.R.D. 451, 458 (E.D.N.Y. 1996).  As Judge McLaughlin explained \nin finding that superiority was met with respect to the class action settlement of the \nPhiladelphia strip search case,  \n[a] class action in this case saves the time, effort and expense of \nlitigating the claims of as many as 37,000 class members individually \nand guarantees uniform treatment of individual class members within \n                                                 \n[20] Courts have recognized that, in the context of certifying a settlement-only class, \nthe “(D)” factor in Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D) is not relevant.  See Boone, 2009 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 103277, at *25.  See also, In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., \n579 F.3d at 257 (“Confronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a \ndistrict court need not inquire whether the case, if tried, would present intractable \nmanagement problems, for the proposal is that there be no trial.”) (quoting Amchem \nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 620 (1997)). \n  - 23 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 35 of 48\n \ntheir respective subclasses… Because it is generally desirable to \nconcentrate many smaller claims into a single forum, a class action is \nappropriate in this case. A class action is the superior method for \nadjudicating this particular matter. \n \nSee Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 708.  Accord, Kurian, E.D. Pa. 07-cv-03482 at 7-8 \n(ECF No. 68) (superiority satisfied in the context of a strip search class settlement).   \nSimilarly, the superiority requirement is met here.   \n   B.   The Settlement Agreement Should Be Approved By the Court. \n \nThe Parties also respectfully request that the Court grant final approval to \nthe Settlement Agreement.  “Compromises of disputed claims are favored by the \ncourts.”  Williams v. First Nat’l Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595 (1910); In re Prudential \nIns. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 317 (3d Cir. 1998) \n(“Prudential II”).  The Settlement Agreement spares the litigants the uncertainty, \ndelay and expense of a trial, while simultaneously reducing the burden on judicial \nresources.  The Court has broad discretion in deciding whether to approve a \nsettlement.  See Kurian, E.D. Pa. 07-cv-03482 at at 8 (ECF No. 68) (citing Girsh v. \nJepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d Cir. 1975)). \nRule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a district \ncourt must determine whether to grant approval to any settlement of a class action.  \nFED. R. CIV. P. 23(e).  In a class action, the “court plays the important role of \nprotector of the [absent members’] interests, in a sort of fiduciary capacity.” In re \nGen. Motors Corp. Pick-up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 785 \n(3rd Cir. 1995) (“GM Trucks”).  As discussed below, the Court should grant final \napproval to the settlement because Class members received notice in the best \n  - 24 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 36 of 48\n \nmanner practicable under the circumstances, and because the substance of the \nSettlement is more than fair, reasonable and adequate, especially in light of the \nThird Circuit’s ruling in Florence means that GEO’s practice of strip searching all \npretrial detainees entering the jail was constitutional. \n  1.  The Notice Satisfied Rule 23(c)(2)(B). \n  Members of a class that is settled pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3) must be \nprovided with “the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances.”  FED. R. \nCIV. P. 23(c)(2)(B).  This includes individual notice to all potential class members \nthat can be identified through reasonable effort.  Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 709.  \nThe substance of the notice must contain, in clear language, a description of the \nnature of the action, settlement class(es), the claims, issues and defenses, the class \nmember’s right to enter an appearance by an attorney and to be excluded from the \nclass, the time and manner of requesting exclusion, and the binding effect of the \nsettlement on class members.  Id. (citing FED. R. CIV. P. 23(c)(2)(B)).   \n  In this case, the notice of the settlement that was provided satisfied FED. R. \nCIV. P. 23(c)(2)(B).  The notice, which was preliminarily approved by the Court \nbefore its dissemination, contained all of the criteria required under Rule \n23(c)(2)(B).  It was mailed to an over-inclusive list of Settlement Class members for \nwhom mailing addresses were available, and then re-mailed to those who had \nundeliverable addresses (and for whom a forwarding address could be obtained).  \nSee §(I)(d), supra.  The notice was posted at the Jails GEO currently operates and at \nregional probation and parole offices.  The notice was publicized via frequent radio \n  - 25 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 37 of 48\n \nadvertisements.  And the notice was published on a website dedicated to the \nsettlement, and was also picked up be several news sources.  As such, the notice \nreadily meets the requirements of Rule 23(c)(2)(B).  See, e.g., Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d \nat 709. \n  2.  The Settlement Satisfies the Girsh Factors. \nThe substance of the settlement should also be approved.  A class settlement \nshould be approved when the court finds it is fair, reasonable and adequate, and is \nin the best interest of class members.  See Fry v. Hayt, Hayt & Landau, 198 F.R.D. \n461, 470 (E.D. Pa. 2000).  In Girsh, the Third Circuit adopted the following nine-\nfactor test for district courts to use in determining whether a class action settlement \nis fair, reasonable and adequate:  \n(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the \nlitigation…; (2) the reaction of the Class to the Settlement…; (3) \nthe stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery \ncompleted…; (4) the risks of establishing liability…’ (5) the risks \nof establishing damages…(6) the risks of maintaining the Class \naction through trial…; (7) the ability of the Defendants to \nwithstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of \nthe Settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery…; (9) \nthe range of reasonableness of the Settlement fund to a possible \nrecovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation. \n \nGirsh, 521 F.2d at 157.21  As set forth below, the Settlement satisfies the Girsh \nfactors.  \n \n \n                                                 \n[21] This nine factor test from Girsh was recently re-affirmed and used by the Third \nCircuit in In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d at 258. \n  - 26 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 38 of 48\n \na.  The Complexity, Expenses and Likely Duration of the \nLitigation Support Final Approval. \n \nThis Girsh factor is intended to capture ‘the probable costs, in both time and \nmoney, of continued litigation.”  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d \nat 629 (citations omitted).  In this case, the litigation began in January of 2008.  \nClass Counsel have reviewed over a thousand of pages of documents, served \ndiscovery requests, interviewed witnesses, and successfully opposed GEO’s motion \nfor judgment on the pleadings.  In all, Plaintiffs’ counsel contends that they have \nexpended in excess of 1,188 hours on this case.  Further, Class Counsel have \ncollectively incurred out of pocket costs of $8,466.51.  Plaintiffs have not \ncompensated for any of their work on the case, nor have they been reimbursed for \nany of these expenses. \nIf Plaintiffs were to continue to trial, the trial would be complex and \nexpensive. Moreover, the outcome of trial would be uncertain.  To prosecute this as \na class action, Plaintiffs would ultimately have to prove that the Defendant’s strip-\nsearch policy was unconstitutional.  Clearly, this is more difficult—indeed, \nimpossible—in light of the recent Precedential Third Circuit opinion in Florence.  \nMoreover, even if Plaintiffs were successful on the merits of their claims (and \nthat holding was not disturbed by the Third Circuit and/or Supreme Court), \nDefendants may argue that Class Members would still be required to prove \n  - 27 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 39 of 48\n \ndamages individually, or in group mini-trials.22  This may have led to unsuccessful \nresults with respect to class certification.   \nIn sum, Class Counsel in this case weighed the risks of pursuing further \nlitigation against the benefit of receiving the proposed settlement in this case, and \nconcluded it was in the Class members’ best interest to resolve this matter at this \njuncture.  Similarly, the Defendants weighed their risks in proceeding to trial, and \ndetermined that the settlement was in its best interests as well.  In light of the \ncurrent legal landscape, the Settlement is therefore more than fair, reasonable and \nadequate.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 712-713.   \nb.  The Reaction of the Class Justifies Final Approval. \nUnder the second Girsh factor, the reaction of the Class is relevant to \nassessing whether the settlement should be approved.  See Prudential II, 148 F.3d \nat 318.   This factor is “attempts to gauge whether members of the class support the \nsettlement…”  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d at 629 (citations \nomitted).   \nIn this case, the low number of exclusions (one) and objection requests (zero) \ncreate a strong presumption in favor of approving the Settlement.  See In re \nLinerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d at 629 (“No class members objected to \neither settlement.  This fact strongly militates a finding that the settlement is fair \nand reasonable.”); Boone v. City of Phila., 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 712 (E.D. Pa. 2009) \n                                                 \n[22] There is recent authority where courts have refused to certify a class in a strip \nsearch class action.  See Rattray v. Woodbury County, No. 07-4032, 2008 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 66922 (N.D. Iowa Sept. 2, 2008), aff’d., No. 09-2314, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS \n16207 (8th Cir. Aug. 5, 2010).   \n  - 28 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 40 of 48\n \n(“The fact that so few potential class members objected to or opted out of the \nsettlement supports a finding of general acceptance of the settlement in the \nclass.”).23  See also, Austin v. Pa. Dept. of Corrections, 876 F. Supp. 1437, 1458 \n(E.D.Pa. 1995) (approving class action settlement of civil rights claims brought by \nprisoners, notwithstanding the receipt of 457 written objections by class members) \n(DuBois, J.).  This is particularly true where, as here, the settlement notification \nmailed to Class members for whom addresses were ascertainable (and the notice \nposted in the prisons and parole/probation offices and on the Settlement Website) \ncontained clear instructions for the procedures to opt-out from or object to the \nSettlement.   \nIn response to the Court-approved notice, nearly 600 Class members have \nsent in claim forms to the Claims Administrator. Id.  Depending on how this \nparticipation is measured, this represents a claims rate as high as 14.5% whereby \nhundreds of Class members will be entitled to the maximum payment under the \nSettlement ($400.00 each).  This positive response rate, coupled with the fact that \nthere were no objections and only one opt-out, supports a finding that this Girsh \nfactor is met.  Indeed, courts have granted final approval to class action settlements \nwith comparable participation rates.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 702-03 \n(approving strip search class action settlement with 15% participation); \n(McLaughlin, J.);  Kurian, E.D. Pa. No. 07-cv-03482 (ECF No. 68) (approving \n                                                 \n[23] The fact that the Settlement Agreement allows dissatisfied class members to \nopt-out of the settlement further supports a finding, in and of itself, that the \nSettlement is fair and reasonable.

City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) \n(approving strip search settlement with 8.5% participation rate).  See also, Zimmer \nPaper Products Inc. v. Berger & Montague, P.C., 758 F.2d 86, 92-93 (3d Cir. 1985) \n(affirming district court’s dismissal of a challenge by a class member to the notice \nassociated with a court-approved settlement that had a 12% response rate).  \nFurthermore, the Settlement Administrator has affirmed that the response rate in \nthis case is comparable to that obtained in similar strip search class action \nsettlements.  See Cozzi Decl. at ¶ 12.   \n      c.  The Stage of the Proceeding and Amount of Discovery \nFavor Final Approval. \n \n  It has been generally recognized by the Third Circuit that settlements that \nare made after discovery reflect the true value of the claim.  See Bell Atlantic Corp. \nv. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1314 (3d Cir. 1993).  The parties in this case exchanged \n  - 30 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 42 of 48\n \ndiscovery requests and disclosures, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents \nregarding the admittance of pretrial detainees at the Jails.  This weighs heavily in \nfavor of approving the Settlement as fair, reasonable and adequate.  Boone, 2009 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 103277, at *38 (“The discovery and other investigations that the \nparties have undertaken render them sufficiently informed to make a determination \nabout the fairness of a settlement.”). \n  Moreover, as discussed above, the Settlement was a product of extensive \nnegotiations between the parties, including a mediation before Retired Judge \nMelinson.  “A presumption of correctness is said to attach to a class settlement \nreached in arms-length negotiations between experienced, capable counsel after \nmeaningful discovery.” In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d at 630 \n(quoting Hanrahan v. Britt, 174 F.R.D. 356, 366 (E.D. Pa. 1997)).  That \npresumption should likewise apply here.   \nd.  The Risks of Establishing Liability and Damages Weigh \nin Favor of Approving Settlement. \n \nThe risks of establishing liability and damages are the fourth and fifth \nfactors to be weighed when evaluating a Settlement.  See In Re Automotive \nRefinishing Paint Antitrust Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d at 343.  “Although the Court \nmust weigh the relative strengths and weaknesses of each side to determine the \nrisks of establishing liability, it should ‘not decide the merits of the case or resolve \nunsettled legal questions.’”  Austin v. Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corrections, 876 F. \nSupp. at 1471 (quoting Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 88 n.14 \n(1981)). \n  - 31 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 43 of 48\n \nThis factor in and of itself weighs heavily in favor of this Settlement being \napproved.  Clearly, the recent precedential opinion issued by the Third Circuit in \nFlorence illustrates the risks associated with establishing liability and damages in \nthis case.  Indeed, given the current state of the law in this Circuit, class members \nwould be entitled to no recovery as a matter of law were this case to be filed or \nlitigated today.   \nIn addition, this putative class action had inherent risks merely by virtue \nthat the GEO represented by the experienced and highly-skilled defense counsel at \nReed Smith LLP.  If this case were to proceed to trial, Plaintiffs would have faced a \nnumber of challenges in order to succeed before a jury.  Specifically, Defendants \nmay have argued that Plaintiffs would have been required to try the individual \nactions for damages, which may have led to unsuccessful results.  Further, there is \na real likelihood that Plaintiffs may have undergone years of litigation in the \nappellate courts.  See In Re Michael Milken & Associates Securities Litigation, 150 \nF.R.D. 57, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 1993).  And even before Florence was resolved by the Third \nCircuit, two en banc circuit court decisions had found that blanket strip-searches \nare not unconstitutional regardless whether reasonable suspicion exists.  See  § \n(II)(B)(2)(a), supra.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 713 (citing to “the risk that the \nclass members might not recover at all…”).  Thus, based on the above risks, \nPlaintiffs obtained a more than favorable result for the Class.   \n \n \n  - 32 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 44 of 48\n \ne.  The Risks of Maintaining a Class Action Through Trial \nWeigh in Favor of Approving this Settlement. \n \nThe risks of maintaining a Class through trial support approval of the \nSettlement.  See Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 321.  In light of the fact that the Third \nCircuit has found that a district court always possesses the authority to decertify an \naction, this factor in and of itself weighs in favor of settlement.  “Consistent with \nthis reality, we are satisfied that the inherent difficulties of bringing a Class action \nto trial weighs in favor of approving the Settlements.”  In Re Automotive \nRefinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation, 617 F.Supp. 2d at 344.  As discussed above, \nthe risk of establishing any liability in light of Florence supports this factor. This \nCourt should find that this factor weighs in favor of approving the Settlement. \nf.  The Ability of Defendants to Withstand Greater \nJudgment. \n \n  Under the seventh Girsh factor, it must be considered whether the defendant \ncould withstand an “amount significantly greater than the Settlement.” In re \nCendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 240 (3d Cir. 2001) (emphasis supplied).  Due to \nthe realities of the current macro-economic environment, this factor weighs heavily \nin favor of finding that a settlement valued at up to nearly $3 million is fair, \nreasonable and adequate.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 712 (taking into \nconsideration the current financial situation of the city-defendant in assessing \nfairness of settlement).  And even if it were theoretically possible that GEO could \nwithstand a “significantly” larger judgment after a trial, this Girsh factor should be \nbalanced against “the risk that the plaintiffs would not be able to achieve any \n  - 33 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 45 of 48\n \ngreater recovery at trial.”  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d at 632 \n(citing Lazy Oil Co. v. Witco Corp., 95 F. Supp. 2d 290, 318 (W.D. Pa. 1997)). \nIndeed, any further litigation on these claims at this time is entirely doomed by the \nFlorence opinion, which held strip searches similar to those employed here are \nfacially legal and constitutional.  When viewed through this spectrum under the \ncircumstances here, it is readily apparent that this Girsh factor is satisfied.  \ng.   The Reasonableness of the Settlement in Light of the \nBest Possible Recovery Weighs in Favor of Approving this \nSettlement. \n \nThe final two Girsh factors require the court to determine whether Plaintiffs \nsettled for appropriate value in light of the Class members’ damages.  See In Re \nAutomotive Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation, 617 F. Supp. 2d at 344.  This \nmatter settled for $2.99 million, and each Class member that timely submitted a \nclaim form will receive $400.  This is a fair value for the settlement, and is \ncomparable to settlement awards in other strip search cases—the large majority of \nwhich were reached prior to the recent split among the circuits.  See McBean v. City \nof New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 388 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (awarding either $750 or $1,000 \nper claimant, depending on the number of times the class member was searched);   \nKurian,  E.D. Pa. No. 07-cv-03482 at 13 (ECF No. 68) (describing the allocation of \npayments ranging from $50 to $900 to class members in a strip search class action \nsettlement as “fair, reasonable, and adequate.”).  As is demonstrated by the above \nanalysis of the Girsh factors, Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s Settlement is clearly an \n  - 34 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 46 of 48\n \nexcellent result and is fair, reasonable and adequate under Girsh.  See Boone, 668 \nF. Supp. 2d at 713. \nh.   The Recommendation of Class Counsel. \n  Finally, in addition to the Girsh factors discussed above, “several courts have \naccorded significant weight to the view of experienced counsel who have engaged in \narm’s-length negotiations.”  Austin, 876 F. Supp. at 1457 (citing In re Unisys Corp. \nRetiree Medical Benefits ERISA Litig., MDL No. 969, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17877 \n(E.D. Pa. Nov. 3, 1994)).  The recommendation of Class counsel in this case that the \nSettlement be approved should, accordingly, be considered by the Court.  See id. at \n1472-73 (citing to the experience of Mr. Rudovsky and others, and finding that their \nrecommendation that the settlement be approved “is entitled to great weight.”).    \nIV.     CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs and Defendant respectfully request that \nthis Court enter an Order that: (1) provides final approval to the Settlement as fair, \nreasonable and adequate, and (2) certifies the Class action with respect to the \nclaims against Defendant pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a) and FED. R. CIV. P. \n23(b)(3) for the purpose of effectuating a class action settlement of the claims \nagainst the Defendants.   \n \n \n \n/ \n/ \n/ \n  - 35 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 47 of 48\n \nDated: September 27,  2010 \nRespectfully submitted, \nFOR PLAINTIFFS AND THE CLASS:     FOR DEFENDANT: \n/s/ David Rudovsky           /s/ Carolyn P.

Dubois \npursuant to this Court’s Order of March 2, 2010 in order for this Court to conduct a \nfinal fairness hearing to determine whether the proposed Settlement Agreement \nbetween the Parties is fair, reasonable and adequate, and to address Class \nCounsel’s application for an award of attorney’s fees and costs; and the Settlement \nClass Members being represented by Class Counsel and Defendant being \nrepresented by their attorney; AND THE COURT having read and considered the \nSettlement Agreement, the Notice Plan, and Memoranda of Law submitted by Class \nCounsel, having received evidence at the hearing, having heard arguments from \nClass Counsel and the Defendant, and having considered the submissions by Class \nMembers, now makes the following: \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 2 of 48\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1.  This action was commenced on January 30, 2008, as a putative class \naction. \n2.  After over a year of intensive litigation, including extensive discovery \nand motion practice, and as a result of intensive, arm’s length negotiations between \nClass Counsel and Defendant, including a settlement conference before former \nMagistrate Judge James K. Melinson, the Parties have reached accord with respect \nto a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class Members, in \nreturn for a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in this case against the \nDefendant (“Settlement Agreement”).  The resulting Settlement Agreement was \npreliminarily approved by the Court on March 2, 2010.  See Docket Entry No. 61. \n3.  As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court \napproved a proposed Notice Plan and Class Notice, which provided Settlement \nClass Members notice of the proposed Settlement.  The Notice Plan provided an \nopportunity for Class Members to file objections to the Settlement, and an \nopportunity to opt-out of the Settlement. \n4.  As of the July 1, 2010 deadline for the filing of objections, none were \nfiled.  Given the size of this Settlement, and the Notice Plan described above, this \nCourt finds that the non-existence of any objections is indicative of the fairness, \nreasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement with the Defendant. \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 3 of 48\n \n5.  The settling Parties have filed with the Court an affidavit from Ryanne \nCozzi of Gilardi & Co. (the Settlement Administrator), declaring that the mailing \nand publication of the Court-approved notice, consistent with the Notice Plan, has \nbeen completed. \n6.  The Court finds that the published radio notice, the mailed notices, the \nposted notices at the Jails GEO operates and appropriate probation and parole \noffices, and the website notice constitute the best practicable notice of the Fairness \nHearing, proposed Settlement, Class Counsel’s application for fees and expenses, \nsuch notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all members of the Class, \nand complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, the Constitution of the United States, the laws of Pennsylvania and any \nother applicable law. \n7.  Any persons who wished to be excluded from this action were provided \nan opportunity to “opt-out” pursuant to the Notice.  As of the deadline to do so, July \n1, 2010, only one person, Timothy Montgomery, has elected to opt out of the \nSettlement.   Mr. Montgomery shall not be bound by the Settlement Agreement or \nthe final judgment herein. \n8.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the:  Settlement, Settlement \nAgreement, Release contained within the Settlement Agreement, and the Final \nOrder and Judgment.  Settlement Class Members do not have a further opportunity \nto opt-out of this Action. \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 4 of 48\n \n9.  Any Class Member who did not timely file and serve an objection in \nwriting to the Settlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or \nto Class Counsel’s application for fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the \nprocedure set forth in the Class Notice and mandated in the Order Granting \nPreliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed to have waived any such objection \nby appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise. \n10.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of \nthe Settlement Agreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, \nreasonable and adequate compromise of the claims against the Defendant in this \ncase, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There are a \nnumber of factors which the Court has considered in affirming this Settlement, \nincluding: \na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nb.  This Settlement has the benefit of providing relief to Class Members \nnow, without further litigation, under circumstances where the liability issues are \nstill vigorously contested among the Parties to this litigation.  This Settlement \nprovides Class Members with a substantial monetary benefit and equitable relief. \nc.  This Settlement is clearly a product of hard-fought litigation between \nthe Parties, and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counsel or Counsel \nfor the Defendant. \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 5 of 48\n \n11.  Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendant \ntheir application for reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses consistent with \nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel’s \nrequest and hereby _______________ the request. \n12.  The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is \nfair, a simplified process, and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain \njurisdiction to work out any unanticipated problems. \n13.  The parties agree that an injunction is appropriate to ensure that \nDefendant complies with its revised written strip search policies at the Jails, as set \nforth in the Settlement Agreement. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF \nFACT, THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS OF \nLAW: \n14.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Parties and the subject matter of \nthis proceeding. \n15.  Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \nfollowing Class is certified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll persons who were placed into the custody of one or more of the Jails \nafter being detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses, or other \ncrimes that did not involve the possession or distribution of drugs, \npossession of weapons, crimes of violence, or felonies, who had no \nhistory of such charges, and did not behave in a manner at intake that \nwould give intake officers reasonable suspicion that the inmate was \ncarrying or concealing contraband, but were strip searched upon their \nadmission into one or more of the Jails pursuant to Defendants’ then-\n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 6 of 48\n \nexisting strip search policy. Excluded from the class are Defendants \nand any and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, \nheirs, successors, employees or assignees.  The Class Period is from \nJanuary 30, 2006 to January 30, 2008 for George W. Hill Correctional \nFacility, Frio County Detention Center, Dickens County Detention \nCenter, Tri-County Detention Center, and Newton County Correctional \nCenter, and from January 30, 2005 to January 30, 2008 for Guadalupe \nCounty Correctional Facility. \n \n16.  The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the \nrequirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and \nthat a class action is an appropriate method for resolving the disputes in this \nlitigation.  All the prerequisites for class certification under Rule 23 are present.  \nThe Class Members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined.  Questions of \nlaw and fact common to all Class Members predominate over individual issues and \nshould be determined in one proceeding with respect to all Class members.  The \nClass Representatives claims are typical of those of the Class.  The Class action \nmechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating and resolving this \naction. \n17.  The Class Representatives, Penny Allison and Zoran Hocevar, are \nentitled to and are hereby awarded a payment of $2,500.00 each, in recognition of \nthe efforts they undertook in connection with this lawsuit.

INTRODUCTION \nThe Settlement, which represents the culmination of over eighteen months of \nhighly contested litigation between the Parties, provides substantial benefits to \ncertain individuals who were strip searched upon admission to the six GEO Jails at \nissue in this case: the George W. Hill Correctional Facility; the Guadalupe County \nCorrectional Facility; the Frio County Detention Center; the Dickens County \nDetention Center; the Tri-County Detention Center; and the Newton County \nCorrectional Center (the “Jails”).3  See Amended Settlement Agreement dated \n                                                 \n[1] Plaintiffs and Defendants shall be collectively referred to herein as the “Parties.” \n \n[2] Separately, Plaintiffs’ Counsel will be filing a motion and supporting \nmemorandum of law in support of their request for attorneys’ fees, expenses, and \nincentive payments for the two named plaintiffs. The parties agreed that GEO has \nthe right to contest Plaintiffs’ counsel’s application for attorney fees and costs.  \nAmended Settlement Agreement (ECF No. 60-3) § III(D) at 11.  GEO will contest \nPlaintiffs’ counsel’s application for attorney fees. \n \n[3] Of the six Jails covered by the Settlement, GEO no longer operates the following \nfour: the George W. Hill Correctional Facility; the Dickens County Detention \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 13 of 48\n \nMarch 1, 2010 (the “Settlement”) (Docket Entry No. 60-3).  Plaintiffs allege that \nGEO violated the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and Class members by illegally \nstrip searching them in the absence of reasonable suspicion.  The Class is defined \nas: \nAll persons who were placed into the custody of one or more of the Jails \nafter being detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses, or other \ncrimes that did not involve the possession or distribution of drugs, \npossession of weapons, crimes of violence, or felonies, who had no \nhistory of such charges, and did not behave in a manner at intake that \nwould give intake officers reasonable suspicion that the inmate was \ncarrying or concealing contraband, but were strip searched upon their \nadmission into one or more of the Jails pursuant to Defendants’ then-\nexisting strip search policy. Excluded from the class are Defendants \nand any and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, \nheirs, successors, employees or assignees.  The Class Period is from \nJanuary 30, 2006 to January 30, 2008 for George W. Hill Correctional \nFacility, Frio County Detention Center, Dickens County Detention \nCenter, Tri-County Detention Center, and Newton County Correctional \nCenter, and from January 30, 2005 to January 30, 2008 for Guadalupe \nCounty Correctional Facility. \nSettlement at 2.4 \n  The Settlement creates a fund valued up to $2,999,000.00 for the benefit of \nClass members who were committed to one of the Jails during the class period.  See \nSettlement at §(I)(OO) (defining the “Settlement Amount” to be $2,999,000.00).  See \nalso, id. at § (I)(NN) (providing that the entire Settlement Amount is to be \n“earmarked for the sole purpose of this case, and will not be utilized for any other \npayments or purposes.”).  \n                                                                                                                                                             \nCenter; the Newton County Correctional Center; and the Tri-County Detention \nCenter. \n \n[4] The Class Period is longer at Guadalupe County Correction Facility because the \napplicable New Mexico Statute of limitations is longer (three years instead of two). \n  - 2 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 14 of 48\n \nThere is a tiered-structure to GEO’s obligation to pays into the Settlement \nFund.  The first $500,000 was paid into the fund to cover the costs of administration \nand claims.  Settlement at § III(B)(1).  The second contribution of $1,000,000 is to be \npaid after the close of the claims period.  Id. at § III(B)(2).1  The Third Contribution \nis isto be paid into the settlement fund if the amount of claims received exceeds the \namount of the Second Contribution; if the amount of the Second Contribution is \nexceeded by the amount of money necessary to pay the number of claims received, \nonly the amount of money necessary to pay those claims need be paid (not the entire \nThird Contribution).  Id. at § III(B)(3) (“In the event the amount of claims received: \n(a) do not exceed the amount of Second Contribution, GEO does not have to pay the \nThird Contribution into the Settlement Fund until it receives notice, if any, from \nthe Settlement Administrator that such contribution is needed to satisfy any claims; \nor (b) exceeds the amount of the Second Contribution but does not rise to the level of \nthe Third Contribution amount, GEO shall pay into the Settlement Fund an \namount of the Third Contribution identified by the Settlement Administrator as \nnecessary to satisfy the claims received.”).  However, the entire amounts of the \nSecond and Third Contributions were to be “set aside by GEO and earmarked for \n                                                 \n[1] The parties have mutually agreed to keep the Claims Period open longer than \nthe September 14, 2010 original claims date; all claims postmarked on or before \nSeptember 30, 2010 will be considered timely. \n \n  - 3 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 15 of 48\n \nthe sole purpose of funding the Settlement Fund, as needed.”  Id. at (III)(B)(2)-(3).  \nAny money that is unused reverts to GEO.  Id. at § III(C)(1).5 \n  As set forth in the Settlement, Class members who timely submitted a claim \nform will be entitled to a check in the amount of $400.00.  Id. at § (III)(C)(1).   \nHundreds of class members elected to participate in this aspect of the settlement \nand sent in timely claim forms.  Only one class member opt-ed out.  None objected.   \n  In addition to this benefit, the Settlement also provided substantial non-\nmonetary benefits to the Class.  Specifically, the settlement agreement expressly \nprovides that upon the filing of (and as a result of) this lawsuit, GEO “stopped strip \nsearching detainees admitted to the Jails without reasonable suspicion ….”  See \nSettlement at § (III)(A)(1).  This commitment to stop conducting blanket strip \nsearches remained in effect from the filing of this lawsuit in January of 2008 until \naround the time that the Third Circuit recently issued its decision in Florence, \ndiscussed infra.  \n  In short, the Parties respectfully submit that this Settlement is fair, \nadequate, and reasonable for the Class (particularly given the current state of the \nlaw after Florence), and that the requirements for final approval are satisfied.  \n \n \n                                                 \n[5] The reverter and the $400 per claim cap are material settlement terms.  \nSettlement Agreement § III(C)(1) (“Both the reverter and the $400 per claim cap are \ncritical, essential and nonnegotiable terms of the settlement, and that \nnonacceptance of theses terms makes this agreement null and void, unless both \nparties agree to any changes in a signed writing.”). \n  - 4 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 16 of 48\n \nII.   BACKGROUND \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Allegations and GEO’s Defenses. \nOn January 30, 2008, Plaintiffs filed this putative class action lawsuit \nagainst GEO challenging its alleged practice of strip searching all arrestees \nregardless of crime, and regardless of whether the officers at intake had reasonable \nsuspicion justifying a search.   Plaintiffs allege that GEO maintained an \nunconstitutional strip search policy and practice throughout the class period by \nmaintaining a strip-search policy whereby it conducted visual strip searches on all \npretrial detainees upon their admission to the Jails in the absence of reasonable \nsuspicion, including those charged with misdemeanor offenses or other minor \ncrimes (referred to as a “blanket” strip search).   \nGEO denies that it had a blanket strip search policy, and contends that \npretrial detainees were only strip searched when reasonable suspicion existed.  \nGEO further contends that it only conducted strip searches where appropriate, and \nthat to the extent that any practice of strip searching all pretrial detainees existed, \nit was a result of the decision-making of the county or governmental units for which \nGEO operated Jails, and was contrary to GEO’s own written Corporate Policy.  All \npretrial detainees who entered the jails were going to inter-mingle with the general \npopulation.  GEO’s sole purpose in strip searching any detainee was to prevent \ncontraband from entering the general population (including drugs, weapons and \nmoney).  GEO contends to have had a long history of recovering contraband in the \njails via intake strip searches. \n  - 5 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 17 of 48\n \nIn response to Plaintiffs’ lawsuit, to the extent any jail had a strip search \npractice of permitting strip searches with less than reasonable suspicion, GEO \nimmediately took steps to effectively implement all of the injunctive relief Plaintiffs \nsought in the Complaint.  Specifically, GEO, through its outside counsel Reed \nSmith, LLP, immediately launched an extensive investigation into what strip \nsearch practices were employed at each of the potentially affected Jails.  As a result \nof this investigation, GEO took steps to recommit to its Corporate Policy to ensure \nthat all Jails employed a policy that no person detained for misdemeanors, \nsummary offenses, or other crimes that did not involve the possession or \ndistribution of drugs, possession of weapons, crimes of violence, or felonies, who had \nno history of such charges, and did not behave in a manner at intake that would \ngive intake officers reasonable suspicion that the inmate was carrying or concealing \ncontraband, was strip searched upon their admission to the Jails.  GEO also \nimplemented a strip search checklist (or “log”) for use at each Jail, which is now \ncompleted by intake personnel for each detainee.  Detainees are only strip searched \nafter that checklist or log is filled out, and only if the checklist or log permits a strip \nsearch under Plaintiffs’ understanding of the law – i.e., only if the checklist or log \nprovides reasonable suspicion.  GEO ensured that all intake personnel and all \nsupervisory employees were affirmatively made aware of these requirements, and \nensured that new employees would be trained on these procedures before working \nat intake. \n \n  - 6 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 18 of 48\n \nB.  History of the Litigation. \nAfter the Amended Complaint in this action was filed on March 28, 2008, a \nnew en banc decision was issued by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Powell v. \nBarrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc), which GEO contends \nmarkedly changed the landscape of strip search litigation by calling into question \ndecades of appellate interpretation of the seminal case of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. \n520, 559 (1979).  As a result of Powell, GEO filed a Motion for Judgment on the \nPleadings, which required extensive briefing by the Parties.  See Docket Entry Nos. \n29, 35, 37, 39, and 40. \nOn March 25, 2009, this Court issued a memorandum and order that denied \nGEO’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. See Docket Entry No. 41.  Shortly \nthereafter, GEO moved for certification for immediate appellate review pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. §1292(b) (the “1292(b) Motion”), which was opposed by Plaintiffs and also \nrequired extensive and complicated briefing.   See id. at Nos. 43, 44, 48, 49.  While \nthe § 1292(b) Motion was pending, the parties entered into settlement negotiations. \nIn addition to this and other motion practice before the Court, the Parties \nhave engaged in discovery over the course of this litigation.6  This included serving \nand responding to interrogatories and document requests.  The parties also \nexchanged initial disclosures pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 26(a).  GEO gathered and \nproduced over 1,200 pages of documents to Plaintiffs, which were reviewed and \nanalyzed by their counsel.  Plaintiffs’ counsel also provided counsel for GEO with \n                                                 \n[6] On October 7, 2008, the Court issued an order that, inter alia, granted in part \nand denied in part GEO’s motion for a stay of discovery.  See Docket Entry No. 33.   \n  - 7 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 19 of 48\n \nresponsive documents.  In addition, Plaintiffs’ counsel contend that they engaged in \na substantial amount of informal discovery and fact gathering.   \nC.  Settlement Negotiations. \n  While GEO’s 1292(b) Motion was pending before this Court, the Parties \nentered into settlement negotiations in the late spring of 2009, with the help of \nretired Magistrate Judge James R. Melinson.  The Parties met for a day-long \nmediation session conducted by Judge Melinson and continued negotiations \nafterwards, conferring by telephone on an almost daily basis.  After continuing to \nnegotiate for over a month, the Parties ultimately reached a preliminary agreement \nto settle on July 17, 2009.  The Parties then spent several months memorializing \nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement, preparing for the administration of the \nSettlement, and drafting the Class Notice that is attached to the Settlement \nAgreement.   \nAlthough these lengthy and complex negotiations have been difficult and \ntime consuming, the Parties’ good-faith efforts to resolve this Litigation ultimately \nresulted in an arm’s-length Settlement representing a thoughtful compromise.  The \nSettlement takes into consideration the Plaintiffs’ concerns regarding their alleged \nconstitutional violations, the Defendant’s prison security concerns, as well as the \nParties’ respective positions regarding the viability of Plaintiffs’ claims.   \nD.  Recent Developments in the State of the Law on Blanket Strip \n  Searches. \n \n  As noted above, during the pendency of this case, the Eleventh Circuit issued \nits en banc decision in Powell, 541 F.3d at 1298. At the time of the settlement \n  - 8 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 20 of 48\n \nnegotiations, the parties were also aware that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nhad ordered en banc consideration of Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, a \nstrip search case presenting similar issues.  On February 9, 2010, the Ninth Circuit, \n7-4, upheld San Francisco’s strip search policy, permitting strip searches of all \npretrial detainees without individualized reasonable suspicion. Bull v. City & \nCounty of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010)  (en banc).   \n  On September 21, 2010, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (which had not \npreviously addressed the issue) issued a precedential opinion which held that the \nconstitution does not forbid jails from conducting blanket strip searches, in the \nabsence of reasonable suspicion, of all newly admitted pretrial detainees, including \nthose arrested only for minor offenses.  Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of \nthe County of Burlington, ___ F.3d ___, No. 09-3661, 2010 WL 3633178 at *13 (3d \nCir. Sept. 21, 2010).7  The Third Circuit “rejected Plaintiffs’ argument that blanket \nstrip searches are unreasonable because jails have little interest in strip-searching \narrestees charges with non-indictable offenses.”  Id. at *10.  Indeed, the majority \nopinion reached this conclusion notwithstanding the plaintiffs’ argument that the \njails did not put forth any evidence of a past smuggling problem or of a single new \npretrial detainee who attempted to conceal contraband.  See Florence, 2010 WL \n3633178 at 30 (“[O]ur interpretation of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bell leads \n                                                 \n[7] Even before the issuance of Florence, infra, both Judge McLoughlin and Judge \nDiamond recognized this uncertainty in the law on the state of strip searches in \nrecent decisions granting final approval to class action settlements challenging \nblanket searches.   Boone v. City of Philadelphia, 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 704-05, 710 \n(E.D. Pa. 2009) (McLaughlin, J.); Kurian v. County of Lancaster, E.D. Pa. No. 07-cv-\n03482, at 9-10, 12 (E.D. Pa Apr. 9, 2010) (unpublished) (ECF No. 68). \n  - 9 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 21 of 48\n \nus to conclude that the Jails are not required to produce such a record.”).  Judge \nPollak filed a dissenting opinion. \n  Thus, the legal landscape has changed dramatically since the settlement in \nthis case was reached.  Were litigation still proceeding, GEO would file, and this \nCourt would likely grant, a motion for judgment on the pleadings to dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ claims based on Florence.  In light of the sea change occurring in this \narea, this settlement could, then, represent for the near future one of the last strip \nsearch settlements negotiated within at least the Third, Ninth, and Eleventh \nCircuits. \n  E.  Benefits Created by the Settlement.  \n   The Settlement Agreement provides for the creation of a Settlement Fund to \ncompensate the Class for these alleged constitutional violations, and provides class \nmembers with certain non-monetary benefits.  \n1.   The Monetary Benefit Created. \nThe Settlement creates a Settlement Fund valued up to $2,999,000.00, tiered \nin three contributions.  See Settlement at §§ (I)(OO) and (III)(B).  Class members \nwere eligible to receive a pro rata share of the Settlement Fund, up to a maximum \nrecovery of $400.00 each.8   Id. at § (III)(C)(1).  These payments to Class members, \nas well as administrative expenses (including the costs of settlement \nadministration, website administration and the provision of notice to class \n                                                 \n[8] Based on the number of timely claims submitted by Class members, each eligible \nClass member will receive $400.00, the maximum amount permissible under the \nSettlement.     \n  - 10 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 22 of 48\n \nmembers), and the amount awarded by the Court for attorneys’ fees and costs and \nincentive awards to the Class Representatives, will be deducted from the \nSettlement Fund.  In the event that there is any money remaining in the \nSettlement Fund after these deductions, the unused portion of the Settlement Fund \nwill revert to GEO.  Id.  In the event that the number of claims received does not \nrequire payment of all of part of the Third Contribution, GEO does not need to \nmake the Third Contribution.9  Id. at § III(B)(3).  Both the reverter and the $400 per \nclaim cap are critical and essential terms of the settlement, and are non-negotiable \nterms by GEO.10 \n    2.   The Non-Monetary Benefits.   \nGEO agreed to all of the class injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs.  \nSpecifically – and as a result of this lawsuit – GEO agreed to ensure that all Jails \nsubject to the Settlement Agreement did not conduct blanket strip searches of \npeople detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses, or other crimes that did not \ninvolve the possession or distribution of drugs, possession of weapons, crimes of \nviolence, or felonies, who had no history of such charges, and did not behave in a \nmanner at intake that would give intake officers reasonable suspicion, be strip \nsearched upon intake at the Jails.  And while the prospective injunctive relief in the \n                                                 \n[9]  However, as noted above the Settlement provides that the entire amount of the \nThird Contribution ”shall be set aside by GEO and earmarked for the sole purpose \nof funding the Settlement Fund, as needed.”  See Settlement at § (III)(B)(3).  \n \n[10] The creation of this Settlement Fund – and extent to which its proceeds will be \ndistributed to Class members who timely submitted valid claim forms – is not \naffected by the recently issued Florence decision.  \n  - 11 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 23 of 48\n \nsettlement will not be enforceable so long as Florence remains the controlling law in \nthe Third Circuit,11 the settlement created value for a thirty-two (32) month period \nby virtue of GEO’s commitment to cease blanket strip searches during this period.   \nF.  Implementation and Administration of the Settlement.  \nPromptly after the Court’s March 2, 2010 order granting preliminary \napproval to the Settlement, the parties began providing the Class Members with \nnotice, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement.  In response, 594 class members \nsubmitted timely claim forms to the settlement administrator.  \n1.   Class Notice and Settlement Administration. \n  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Court-approved notice was \nmailed to the last known or readily ascertainable mailing addresses for the 6,551 \npotential Class Members where address information could reasonably be obtained.12  \nThe notice was also provided to the Class by posting notices at each of the Jails \nGEO currently operates, and the probation and parole offices in the relevant \ngeographic areas.  In addition, the Settlement Administrator, Gilardi & Co., LLC, \ncaused an announcement of the Settlement on the radio stations KLEY in San \n                                                 \n[11] Should the Third Circuit’s 2-1 Florence decision be reversed by an en banc panel \nand/or by the Supreme Court of the United States, the prospective injunction in the \nsettlement will be reinstated by operation of law.  Plaintiffs note that the en banc \npanels of both the Eleventh and Ninth Circuits have granted reviews of Powell and \nBull, respectively.  \n[12] Of the 6,551 addresses of potential Class Members on the Mailing List to whom \nnotice was mailed, 2,211 notices were returned as undeliverable from the initial \nmailing.  See Cozzi Declaration at ¶ 6.  Through a third party locator service, \nGilardi has performed address searches for these potential class members and was \nable to find updated addresses for 1,048 class members. Id.  A total of 4,076 Notice \nPackets that were mailed were not returned as undeliverable.  Id. at ¶ 7.   \n  - 12 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 24 of 48\n \nAntonio Texas, KISS in San Antonio Texas, KTCX in Beaumont Texas, KIKR in \nBeaumont Texas, KAIQ in Lubbock Texas, KFMX in Lubbock Texas, KSSR in \nSanta Rosa New Mexico, WPHI in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, ESPN 950.in \nPhiladelphia Pennsylvania, ESPN 97.50 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, and KGMO \nin Ullin Illinois.  See Declaration of Ryanne Cozzi at ¶ 8 (Ex. 1).    The radio notice \nwas broadcasted a total of 454 times throughout these 11 markets.  Id.  \nThe Settlement Administrator established a website where Settlement Class \nMembers could (and still can) obtain information and Claim Forms,13  and maintain \na toll-free number for use by Class Members.  The Settlement Website made claim \nforms and notice available in both Spanish and English.  The Settlement Website \nwas visited by 3,110 unique visitors. See Cozzi Decl. at ¶ 4.  The Settlement \nAdministrator has also received 222 calls from potential Class Members inquiring \nabout the settlement.  Id. at ¶ 3.  In addition to the mass mailing that occurred on \nMay 17, 2010, the Settlement Administrator has sent 213 claim forms to class \nmembers that called to request one.  Id. at ¶ 9. \n  News of the settlement also received media coverage in several regional \nmarkets, including the greater Philadelphia, San Antonio, Southern Illinois, and \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico areas.  See Exhibits A-F of the Declaration of Benjamin \nF. Johns in Support of Final Approval of Settlement (Ex. 2).  While this third-party \nnews coverage was not expressly contemplated in the Settlement or preliminary \napproval order, it is additional evidence that that Class members were provided \n                                                 \n[13] See http://www.multistatestripsearchsettlement.com/casedocs.html. \n  - 13 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 25 of 48\n \nwith constitutionally adequate notice of the Settlement.  See Krell v. Prudential Ins. \nCo. of Am. (In Re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions), 148 \nF.3d 283, 327 (3d Cir. 1998); Wilson v. Airborne, Inc., No. 07-770, 2008 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 110411, at *13 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2008) (“[T]hough it was not part of the \nplan for disseminating notice, initial media coverage of the settlement agreement \nprovided additional opportunities for class members to learn about the \nsettlement.”). \n  2.  Response by Class Members. \nNot a single class member has objected to the Settlement, and only one class \nmember elected to opt-out.  The correspondence received by this class member who \nopted-out does not express any displeasure about the merits, substance, or fairness \nof the Settlement.  See Exhibit B of the Cozzi Decl.  Indeed, it does not set forth any \nreason why this particular person wishes to be excluded.   \nAs of September 21, 2010, a total of 594 class members have filed timely \nclaim forms, and 4 late claim forms have been filed.1314   The participation rate of \nthe class members who received the 4,076 notices that were returned as \nundeliverable) was 14.5%.15  According to the claims administrator’s experience \nfrom work on other class action settlements, these figures are comparable to that \nseen in similar cases.  See Cozzi Decl. at ¶ 12. \n                                                 \n[14] The parties have agreed that these and any late claims received which are post \nmarked by September 30, 2010 will be included, and any claims post marked after \nthat date will not be.  \n \n[15] There were 6,551 notices in total sent to potential Class members.  Of those, \n2475 were returned as undeliverable.  \n  - 14 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 26 of 48\n \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nThe Third Circuit requires that before a class action settlement agreement is \napproved, the district court must find that the settlement is fair, reasonable and \nadequate under FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e).  See Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153 (3d Cir. \n1975).  The district court must also find that the class meets the requirements for \ncertification set forth in FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a) and 23(b).  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d \nat 705.  A district court’s determination of whether the Rule 23(a) and 23(b) \nrequirements are met is subject to its discretion.  See Sullivan v. DB Investments, \nInc., No. 08-2784, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 14375, at *18 (3d Cir. Jul. 13, 2010) (citing \nIn re Schering Plough Corp. ERISA Litig., 589 F.3d 585, 595 (3d Cir. 2009)).   \nWhere – as here – the Court has already preliminarily approved the settlement, “an \ninitial presumption of fairness” is established.1416  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., \n321 F. Supp. 2d 619, 628 (E.D.Pa. 2004) (DuBois, J.) (quoting In re Gen. Motors \nCorp., 55 F.3d at 768, 785 (3d Cir. 1995)). \nAs set forth below, the Parties’ Settlement Agreement meets the requisite \ncriteria for final approval.  It should therefore be granted, the Settlement Class \nshould be certified, and this case should be dismissed with prejudice.  \n  A.   Certification of the Proposed Settlement Class is Appropriate to  \n   Resolve All Strip-Search Claims Against Defendants. \n  \nTo certify a class under Rule 23, the Court must find that all of the \nrequirements of Rule 23(a) are met, as well as at least one part of Rule 23(b).  See \n                                                 \n[16] On March 2, 2010, the Court in this case issued an order granting preliminary \napproval to the Settlement.  See Docket Entry No. 61. \n  - 15 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 27 of 48\n \nBoone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 705 (citing Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 55 (3d Cir. \n1994)).  The Settlement Class readily satisfy these requirements.17  It consists of \nthousands of individuals, hundreds of whom have elected to receive the monetary \nbenefits of the Settlement.  The claims of the class representatives and the \nsettlement class are typical because they are based on the same challenges to the \nsame conduct by the Defendants, and both the named plaintiffs and their counsel \nare adequate representatives.  There are several factual and legal questions that \nare common to the Class, which predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual members.  Finally, a class action is the superior method for fairly and \nefficiently adjudicating this controversy.   Other courts that have addressed blanket \nstrip search policies or practices have consistently recognized the propriety of \ncertifying such cases as class actions, and granting approval to class action \nsettlements. See e.g., Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 708.  See also, Florence v. Board of \nChosen Freeholders, 05-3619, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152, at *48 (D.N.J., Mar. 20, \n2008).  \n       1.  Numerosity Under Rule 23(a)(1). \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the Class be “so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.”   FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1).  The numerosity requirement \nwill generally be satisfied if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential \n                                                 \n[17] Defendant agrees to certification of a class for settlement purposes only; if this \nsettlement is not approved, Defendant retains all rights to challenge certification of \na litigation class. \n  - 16 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 28 of 48\n \nnumber of Plaintiffs exceeds forty (40).  See Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226-\n27 (3d Cir. 2001). \nThe Class here consists of thousands of geographically dispersed Class \nmembers, hundreds of whom have submitted claim forms.   Thus, numerosity is \nreadily satisfied in this case.  See, e.g., Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 705 (numerosity \nmet in strip search class action against City of Philadelphia involving thousands of \nclass members).   \n      2.    Commonality Under Rule 23(a)(2). \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the \nClass.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(2).  The commonality requirement is met if Plaintiffs’ \ngrievances share a common question of law or of fact.  See Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56. \n“It is well-established in the Third Circuit that commonality does not require all \nclaims and facts among class members be identical, rather a single common issue of \nlaw or fact shared by the named plaintiffs and the prospective class will suffice.” \nClarke v. Lane, 267 F.R.D. 180, 196 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (citations omitted).  A party is \nentitled to certification where the Class claims arise “from a common nucleus of \noperative fact’ regardless of whether the underlying facts fluctuate over the Class \nperiod and vary as to individual claimants.” In re Asbestos Sch. Litig., 104 F.R.D. \n422, 429 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (citations omitted).   \nApplying these principles, it is clear that the commonality requirement of \nRule 23(a)(2) is easily met here.  The central issues posed by this litigation are \nwhether the GEO-run Jails had a blanket strip-search policy and/or practice during \n  - 17 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 29 of 48\n \nthe Class period, and whether such a practice or policy is constitutional. See \nKurian, E.D. Pa. No. 07-CV-03482 at 5 (ECF No. 68) (finding commonality satisfied \nbased on similar constitutional challenges to a prison’s strip search practices).  The \nPlaintiffs both assert a common claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for GEO’s \nalleged violation of the constitution.  Given these common questions central to the \nlitigation, Rule 23(a)(2)’s requirement for the existence of common questions of fact \nor law has been met here.  See id.  See also, Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 706; Florence, \n2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152, at *21.   \n     3.   Typicality Under Rule 23(a)(3). \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that a representative plaintiff’s claims be “typical” of \nthose of other Class members.  The commonality and typicality requirements of \nRule 23(a) “tend to merge.” Gen. Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 \nn.13 (1982).  The requirement of typicality, along with the adequacy of \nrepresentation requirement set forth in Rule 23(a)(4), are designed to assure that \nthe interests of unnamed Class members will be protected adequately by the named \nClass representative. Id.  The typicality requirement “is satisfied when each Class \nmember’s claim arises from the same course of events, and each Class member \nmakes similar legal arguments to prove the Defendant’s liability.” Marisol A. v. \nGiuliani, 126 F.3d 372 (2d Cir. 1997).   \nHere, the claims of named Plaintiffs Penny Alison and Zoran Hocevar are \ntypical of the claims of the Settlement Class.  Their claims arise from the same \ncourse of events, and both would have to make the same arguments as the Class in \n  - 18 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 30 of 48\n \nchallenging the constitutionality of Defendants’ strip search practices.  As such, \ntypicality as readily satisfied here.  See Florence, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152, at \n*25. \n      4.    Adequacy Under Rule 23(a)(4). \nThe final requirement of Rule 23(a) is set forth in subsection 23(a)(4), which \nrequires that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the Class.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(4).   The Third Circuit has consistently \nruled that:  \nAdequate representation depends on two factors: (a) the \nPlaintiff’s  attorney  must  be  qualified,  experienced  and \ngenerally able to conduct the proposed litigation; and (b) \nthe Plaintiff must not have interests antagonistic to those \nof the Class.  \n \nWeiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786, 811 (3d Cir. 1984) (quoting Wetzel v.Liberty \nMutual Ins. Co., 508 F.2d 239, 247 (3d Cir. 1975)). \nThese two components are designed to ensure that absentee Class members’ \ninterests are fully and adequately pursued.  The existence of the elements of \nadequate representation are presumed, and “the burden is on the Defendant to \ndemonstrate that the representation will be inadequate.” Asbestos School \nLitigation, 104 F.R.D. at 430 (citing Lewis v. Curtis, 671 F.2d 779 (3d Cir. 1982)). \nRepresentative Plaintiffs and Class Counsel have fairly and adequately \nrepresented the Settlement Class here, especially judging by the excellent \nsettlement achieved in this litigation. With respect to the issue of adequacy of \ncounsel, the Class is represented by competent and experienced counsel who are \n  - 19 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 31 of 48\n \nexperienced in civil rights and class action litigation, and who have invested time \nand resources into the prosecution of this action.  See Kurian, E.D. Pa. No. 07-cv-\n03482, at 6 (ECF No. 68) (describing class counsel in that case – many of whom are \nthe same plaintiffs’ lawyers in this case – as “especially talented lawyers” who are \n“vastly experienced in class action litigation” and “are more than capable of \nrepresenting the Class.”).   \nAs to the second issue, there is nothing to suggest that the named Plaintiffs \nhave interests antagonistic to those of the absent Class members.  See Beck v. \nMaximus, Inc., 457 F.3d 291, 296 (3d Cir. 2006) (adequacy “assures that the named \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not antagonistic to the Class”). See also, Florence, 2008 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 22152, at *31.  The named Plaintiffs sought to bring an end to allegedly \nillegal strip-searches at the Jails, and are committed to obtaining appropriate \ncompensation from Defendants for themselves and for the members of the proposed \nClass.  The named Plaintiffs have come forward to represent the Settlement Class \nunder great personal pressure – being subject to an event that some consider \nhumiliating and would be difficult to recall on a regular basis for litigation \npurposes.  Adequacy is therefore met in this case. \n5.  The Requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) Are Met. \n \nThe proposed Class also satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) of the  \n \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under this rule, a class action may be maintained  \n \nif:  \n \nthe court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the \nmembers of the Class predominate over any questions affecting only \n  - 20 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 32 of 48\n \nindividual members, and that a Class action is superior to other \navailable methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the \ncontroversy.  \n \nFED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3).  The Rule 23(b)(3) analysis is commonly broken down into a \n“predominance” part and a “superiority” part.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 707 \n(citing In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d 241 (3d Cir. 2009)).  As \ndiscussed below, both parts of the test are met here. \n      a.  Predominance.   \n \n“The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed Classes are \nsufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.” Amchem, 521 U. S. \nat 623.  Although Rule 23(b)(3) requires that common issues of law and fact \npredominate, it does not require that there be an absence of any individual issues.  \nSee In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litig., 73 F.R.D. 322, 344 (E.D. Pa. 1976). The \nCourt must find that “the group for which certification is sought seeks to remedy a \ncommon legal grievance.” Hochschuler v. G.D. Searle & Co., 82 F.R.D. 339, 348-49 \n(N.D. Ill. 1978); Dietrich, 192 F.R.D. at 119 (in determining whether common issues \nof fact predominate, “a court’s inquiry is directed primarily toward whether the \nissue of liability is common to members of the Class”).  Rule 23(b)(3) does not \nrequire that all questions of law or fact be common. See In re Telectronics Pacing \nSystems, 172 F.R.D. 271, 287-88 (S.D. Ohio 1997).  \nHere, the proposed Settlement Classes’ claims involve one central question: \nwas GEO’s alleged practice of strip-searching every pretrial detainee admitted to \nthe Jails constitutional when conducted without regard to the crime charged or the \n  - 21 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 33 of 48\n \ncircumstances of arrest?  Proof of this issue would have been the undoubted focus of \nany trial,18 and would predominate over any of the Plaintiffs’ individual issues.  See \nFlorence, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152 at *36.19  As a result, “[n]umerous courts \nhave found Rule 23(b)’s predominance requirement satisfied in actions similar to \nthe instant matter, reasoning that the issues respecting the existance and \nconstitutionality of strip searching policies or practices are common to the class and \nsubject to generalized proof.”  Kurian, E.D. Pa. No. 07-CV-03482 at 6 (ECF No. 68) \n(citations omitted).   General evidence of the Defendants’ policy and its blanket \napplication to Class members will be required to prove their claims.  See Boone, 668 \nF. Supp. 2d at 708.  Accordingly, predominance is met.   \n  b.  Superiority.  \nThe relevant inquiry for the superiority determination is whether a class \naction, rather than individual litigation, is the best method for achieving a fair and \nefficient adjudication.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 708 (citing Newton v. Merrill \nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154 (3d Cir. 2001)).   FED. R. CIV. P.  \n23(b)(3) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors to aid the Court in determining \nwhether a class action is the superior method of adjudication: \n(A) the class members’ interests in individually controlling the \nprosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of \n                                                 \n[18] Defendant agrees to certification of a class for settlement purposes only; if this \nsettlement is not approved, Defendant retains all rights to challenge certification of \na litigation class. \n \n[19] The Third Circuit recently ruled that this single question has a single answer—\nan unqualified yes, GEO’s practices (to the extent any blanket strip search practice \nexisted) were, in fact, constitutional. \n  - 22 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 34 of 48\n \nany litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against \nclass members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating \nthe litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely \ndifficulties in managing a class action.20 \n \nGiven the nature of this action and the fact that a substantial proportion of \nthe Class membership is comprised of economically disenfranchised individuals, a \nclass action is also the superior method by which to adjudicate claims of individual \nClass members.  See Florence, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152 at *41 (superiority \nfound in strip search class action).  In the absence of this class action settlement, \nClass members may not have even been aware that the Defendants allegedly \nviolated their constitutional rights, much less actually pursue those claims.  See In \nre Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 229 (2d Cir. 2006).  Indeed, \npoor and marginalized Class members are unlikely to be able to litigate their cases \nindividually, particularly given the relatively small amounts of their potential \nindividual recovery in such a case. See Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 25; D’Alauro v. GC \nServices Ltd, 168 F.R.D. 451, 458 (E.D.N.Y. 1996).  As Judge McLaughlin explained \nin finding that superiority was met with respect to the class action settlement of the \nPhiladelphia strip search case,  \n[a] class action in this case saves the time, effort and expense of \nlitigating the claims of as many as 37,000 class members individually \nand guarantees uniform treatment of individual class members within \n                                                 \n[20] Courts have recognized that, in the context of certifying a settlement-only class, \nthe “(D)” factor in Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D) is not relevant.  See Boone, 2009 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 103277, at *25.  See also, In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., \n579 F.3d at 257 (“Confronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a \ndistrict court need not inquire whether the case, if tried, would present intractable \nmanagement problems, for the proposal is that there be no trial.”) (quoting Amchem \nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 620 (1997)). \n  - 23 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 35 of 48\n \ntheir respective subclasses… Because it is generally desirable to \nconcentrate many smaller claims into a single forum, a class action is \nappropriate in this case. A class action is the superior method for \nadjudicating this particular matter. \n \nSee Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 708.  Accord, Kurian, E.D. Pa. 07-cv-03482 at 7-8 \n(ECF No. 68) (superiority satisfied in the context of a strip search class settlement).   \nSimilarly, the superiority requirement is met here.   \n   B.   The Settlement Agreement Should Be Approved By the Court. \n \nThe Parties also respectfully request that the Court grant final approval to \nthe Settlement Agreement.  “Compromises of disputed claims are favored by the \ncourts.”  Williams v. First Nat’l Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595 (1910); In re Prudential \nIns. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 317 (3d Cir. 1998) \n(“Prudential II”).  The Settlement Agreement spares the litigants the uncertainty, \ndelay and expense of a trial, while simultaneously reducing the burden on judicial \nresources.  The Court has broad discretion in deciding whether to approve a \nsettlement.  See Kurian, E.D. Pa. 07-cv-03482 at at 8 (ECF No. 68) (citing Girsh v. \nJepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d Cir. 1975)). \nRule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a district \ncourt must determine whether to grant approval to any settlement of a class action.  \nFED. R. CIV. P. 23(e).  In a class action, the “court plays the important role of \nprotector of the [absent members’] interests, in a sort of fiduciary capacity.” In re \nGen. Motors Corp. Pick-up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 785 \n(3rd Cir. 1995) (“GM Trucks”).  As discussed below, the Court should grant final \napproval to the settlement because Class members received notice in the best \n  - 24 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 36 of 48\n \nmanner practicable under the circumstances, and because the substance of the \nSettlement is more than fair, reasonable and adequate, especially in light of the \nThird Circuit’s ruling in Florence means that GEO’s practice of strip searching all \npretrial detainees entering the jail was constitutional. \n  1.  The Notice Satisfied Rule 23(c)(2)(B). \n  Members of a class that is settled pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3) must be \nprovided with “the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances.”  FED. R. \nCIV. P. 23(c)(2)(B).  This includes individual notice to all potential class members \nthat can be identified through reasonable effort.  Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 709.  \nThe substance of the notice must contain, in clear language, a description of the \nnature of the action, settlement class(es), the claims, issues and defenses, the class \nmember’s right to enter an appearance by an attorney and to be excluded from the \nclass, the time and manner of requesting exclusion, and the binding effect of the \nsettlement on class members.  Id. (citing FED. R. CIV. P. 23(c)(2)(B)).   \n  In this case, the notice of the settlement that was provided satisfied FED. R. \nCIV. P. 23(c)(2)(B).  The notice, which was preliminarily approved by the Court \nbefore its dissemination, contained all of the criteria required under Rule \n23(c)(2)(B).  It was mailed to an over-inclusive list of Settlement Class members for \nwhom mailing addresses were available, and then re-mailed to those who had \nundeliverable addresses (and for whom a forwarding address could be obtained).  \nSee §(I)(d), supra.  The notice was posted at the Jails GEO currently operates and at \nregional probation and parole offices.  The notice was publicized via frequent radio \n  - 25 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 37 of 48\n \nadvertisements.  And the notice was published on a website dedicated to the \nsettlement, and was also picked up be several news sources.  As such, the notice \nreadily meets the requirements of Rule 23(c)(2)(B).  See, e.g., Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d \nat 709. \n  2.  The Settlement Satisfies the Girsh Factors. \nThe substance of the settlement should also be approved.  A class settlement \nshould be approved when the court finds it is fair, reasonable and adequate, and is \nin the best interest of class members.  See Fry v. Hayt, Hayt & Landau, 198 F.R.D. \n461, 470 (E.D. Pa. 2000).  In Girsh, the Third Circuit adopted the following nine-\nfactor test for district courts to use in determining whether a class action settlement \nis fair, reasonable and adequate:  \n(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the \nlitigation…; (2) the reaction of the Class to the Settlement…; (3) \nthe stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery \ncompleted…; (4) the risks of establishing liability…’ (5) the risks \nof establishing damages…(6) the risks of maintaining the Class \naction through trial…; (7) the ability of the Defendants to \nwithstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of \nthe Settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery…; (9) \nthe range of reasonableness of the Settlement fund to a possible \nrecovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation. \n \nGirsh, 521 F.2d at 157.21  As set forth below, the Settlement satisfies the Girsh \nfactors.  \n \n \n                                                 \n[21] This nine factor test from Girsh was recently re-affirmed and used by the Third \nCircuit in In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d at 258. \n  - 26 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 38 of 48\n \na.  The Complexity, Expenses and Likely Duration of the \nLitigation Support Final Approval. \n \nThis Girsh factor is intended to capture ‘the probable costs, in both time and \nmoney, of continued litigation.”  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d \nat 629 (citations omitted).  In this case, the litigation began in January of 2008.  \nClass Counsel have reviewed over a thousand of pages of documents, served \ndiscovery requests, interviewed witnesses, and successfully opposed GEO’s motion \nfor judgment on the pleadings.  In all, Plaintiffs’ counsel contends that they have \nexpended in excess of 1,188 hours on this case.  Further, Class Counsel have \ncollectively incurred out of pocket costs of $8,466.51.  Plaintiffs have not \ncompensated for any of their work on the case, nor have they been reimbursed for \nany of these expenses. \nIf Plaintiffs were to continue to trial, the trial would be complex and \nexpensive. Moreover, the outcome of trial would be uncertain.  To prosecute this as \na class action, Plaintiffs would ultimately have to prove that the Defendant’s strip-\nsearch policy was unconstitutional.  Clearly, this is more difficult—indeed, \nimpossible—in light of the recent Precedential Third Circuit opinion in Florence.  \nMoreover, even if Plaintiffs were successful on the merits of their claims (and \nthat holding was not disturbed by the Third Circuit and/or Supreme Court), \nDefendants may argue that Class Members would still be required to prove \n  - 27 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 39 of 48\n \ndamages individually, or in group mini-trials.22  This may have led to unsuccessful \nresults with respect to class certification.   \nIn sum, Class Counsel in this case weighed the risks of pursuing further \nlitigation against the benefit of receiving the proposed settlement in this case, and \nconcluded it was in the Class members’ best interest to resolve this matter at this \njuncture.  Similarly, the Defendants weighed their risks in proceeding to trial, and \ndetermined that the settlement was in its best interests as well.  In light of the \ncurrent legal landscape, the Settlement is therefore more than fair, reasonable and \nadequate.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 712-713.   \nb.  The Reaction of the Class Justifies Final Approval. \nUnder the second Girsh factor, the reaction of the Class is relevant to \nassessing whether the settlement should be approved.  See Prudential II, 148 F.3d \nat 318.   This factor is “attempts to gauge whether members of the class support the \nsettlement…”  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d at 629 (citations \nomitted).   \nIn this case, the low number of exclusions (one) and objection requests (zero) \ncreate a strong presumption in favor of approving the Settlement.  See In re \nLinerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d at 629 (“No class members objected to \neither settlement.  This fact strongly militates a finding that the settlement is fair \nand reasonable.”); Boone v. City of Phila., 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 712 (E.D. Pa. 2009) \n                                                 \n[22] There is recent authority where courts have refused to certify a class in a strip \nsearch class action.  See Rattray v. Woodbury County, No. 07-4032, 2008 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 66922 (N.D. Iowa Sept. 2, 2008), aff’d., No. 09-2314, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS \n16207 (8th Cir. Aug. 5, 2010).   \n  - 28 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 40 of 48\n \n(“The fact that so few potential class members objected to or opted out of the \nsettlement supports a finding of general acceptance of the settlement in the \nclass.”).23  See also, Austin v. Pa. Dept. of Corrections, 876 F. Supp. 1437, 1458 \n(E.D.Pa. 1995) (approving class action settlement of civil rights claims brought by \nprisoners, notwithstanding the receipt of 457 written objections by class members) \n(DuBois, J.).  This is particularly true where, as here, the settlement notification \nmailed to Class members for whom addresses were ascertainable (and the notice \nposted in the prisons and parole/probation offices and on the Settlement Website) \ncontained clear instructions for the procedures to opt-out from or object to the \nSettlement.   \nIn response to the Court-approved notice, nearly 600 Class members have \nsent in claim forms to the Claims Administrator. Id.  Depending on how this \nparticipation is measured, this represents a claims rate as high as 14.5% whereby \nhundreds of Class members will be entitled to the maximum payment under the \nSettlement ($400.00 each).  This positive response rate, coupled with the fact that \nthere were no objections and only one opt-out, supports a finding that this Girsh \nfactor is met.  Indeed, courts have granted final approval to class action settlements \nwith comparable participation rates.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 702-03 \n(approving strip search class action settlement with 15% participation); \n(McLaughlin, J.);  Kurian, E.D. Pa. No. 07-cv-03482 (ECF No. 68) (approving \n                                                 \n[23] The fact that the Settlement Agreement allows dissatisfied class members to \nopt-out of the settlement further supports a finding, in and of itself, that the \nSettlement is fair and reasonable.

See Cozzi Decl. at ¶ 12.   \n      c.  The Stage of the Proceeding and Amount of Discovery \nFavor Final Approval. \n \n  It has been generally recognized by the Third Circuit that settlements that \nare made after discovery reflect the true value of the claim.  See Bell Atlantic Corp. \nv. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1314 (3d Cir. 1993).  The parties in this case exchanged \n  - 30 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 42 of 48\n \ndiscovery requests and disclosures, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents \nregarding the admittance of pretrial detainees at the Jails.  This weighs heavily in \nfavor of approving the Settlement as fair, reasonable and adequate.  Boone, 2009 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 103277, at *38 (“The discovery and other investigations that the \nparties have undertaken render them sufficiently informed to make a determination \nabout the fairness of a settlement.”). \n  Moreover, as discussed above, the Settlement was a product of extensive \nnegotiations between the parties, including a mediation before Retired Judge \nMelinson.  “A presumption of correctness is said to attach to a class settlement \nreached in arms-length negotiations between experienced, capable counsel after \nmeaningful discovery.” In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d at 630 \n(quoting Hanrahan v. Britt, 174 F.R.D. 356, 366 (E.D. Pa. 1997)).  That \npresumption should likewise apply here.   \nd.  The Risks of Establishing Liability and Damages Weigh \nin Favor of Approving Settlement. \n \nThe risks of establishing liability and damages are the fourth and fifth \nfactors to be weighed when evaluating a Settlement.  See In Re Automotive \nRefinishing Paint Antitrust Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d at 343.  “Although the Court \nmust weigh the relative strengths and weaknesses of each side to determine the \nrisks of establishing liability, it should ‘not decide the merits of the case or resolve \nunsettled legal questions.’”  Austin v. Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corrections, 876 F. \nSupp. at 1471 (quoting Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 88 n.14 \n(1981)). \n  - 31 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 43 of 48\n \nThis factor in and of itself weighs heavily in favor of this Settlement being \napproved.  Clearly, the recent precedential opinion issued by the Third Circuit in \nFlorence illustrates the risks associated with establishing liability and damages in \nthis case.  Indeed, given the current state of the law in this Circuit, class members \nwould be entitled to no recovery as a matter of law were this case to be filed or \nlitigated today.   \nIn addition, this putative class action had inherent risks merely by virtue \nthat the GEO represented by the experienced and highly-skilled defense counsel at \nReed Smith LLP.  If this case were to proceed to trial, Plaintiffs would have faced a \nnumber of challenges in order to succeed before a jury.  Specifically, Defendants \nmay have argued that Plaintiffs would have been required to try the individual \nactions for damages, which may have led to unsuccessful results.  Further, there is \na real likelihood that Plaintiffs may have undergone years of litigation in the \nappellate courts.  See In Re Michael Milken & Associates Securities Litigation, 150 \nF.R.D. 57, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 1993).  And even before Florence was resolved by the Third \nCircuit, two en banc circuit court decisions had found that blanket strip-searches \nare not unconstitutional regardless whether reasonable suspicion exists.  See  § \n(II)(B)(2)(a), supra.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 713 (citing to “the risk that the \nclass members might not recover at all…”).  Thus, based on the above risks, \nPlaintiffs obtained a more than favorable result for the Class.   \n \n \n  - 32 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 44 of 48\n \ne.  The Risks of Maintaining a Class Action Through Trial \nWeigh in Favor of Approving this Settlement. \n \nThe risks of maintaining a Class through trial support approval of the \nSettlement.  See Prudential II, 148 F.3d at 321.  In light of the fact that the Third \nCircuit has found that a district court always possesses the authority to decertify an \naction, this factor in and of itself weighs in favor of settlement.  “Consistent with \nthis reality, we are satisfied that the inherent difficulties of bringing a Class action \nto trial weighs in favor of approving the Settlements.”  In Re Automotive \nRefinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation, 617 F.Supp. 2d at 344.  As discussed above, \nthe risk of establishing any liability in light of Florence supports this factor. This \nCourt should find that this factor weighs in favor of approving the Settlement. \nf.  The Ability of Defendants to Withstand Greater \nJudgment. \n \n  Under the seventh Girsh factor, it must be considered whether the defendant \ncould withstand an “amount significantly greater than the Settlement.” In re \nCendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 240 (3d Cir. 2001) (emphasis supplied).  Due to \nthe realities of the current macro-economic environment, this factor weighs heavily \nin favor of finding that a settlement valued at up to nearly $3 million is fair, \nreasonable and adequate.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 712 (taking into \nconsideration the current financial situation of the city-defendant in assessing \nfairness of settlement).  And even if it were theoretically possible that GEO could \nwithstand a “significantly” larger judgment after a trial, this Girsh factor should be \nbalanced against “the risk that the plaintiffs would not be able to achieve any \n  - 33 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 45 of 48\n \ngreater recovery at trial.”  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d at 632 \n(citing Lazy Oil Co. v. Witco Corp., 95 F. Supp. 2d 290, 318 (W.D. Pa. 1997)). \nIndeed, any further litigation on these claims at this time is entirely doomed by the \nFlorence opinion, which held strip searches similar to those employed here are \nfacially legal and constitutional.  When viewed through this spectrum under the \ncircumstances here, it is readily apparent that this Girsh factor is satisfied.  \ng.   The Reasonableness of the Settlement in Light of the \nBest Possible Recovery Weighs in Favor of Approving this \nSettlement. \n \nThe final two Girsh factors require the court to determine whether Plaintiffs \nsettled for appropriate value in light of the Class members’ damages.  See In Re \nAutomotive Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation, 617 F. Supp. 2d at 344.  This \nmatter settled for $2.99 million, and each Class member that timely submitted a \nclaim form will receive $400.  This is a fair value for the settlement, and is \ncomparable to settlement awards in other strip search cases—the large majority of \nwhich were reached prior to the recent split among the circuits.  See McBean v. City \nof New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 388 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (awarding either $750 or $1,000 \nper claimant, depending on the number of times the class member was searched);   \nKurian,  E.D. Pa. No. 07-cv-03482 at 13 (ECF No. 68) (describing the allocation of \npayments ranging from $50 to $900 to class members in a strip search class action \nsettlement as “fair, reasonable, and adequate.”).  As is demonstrated by the above \nanalysis of the Girsh factors, Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s Settlement is clearly an \n  - 34 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 46 of 48\n \nexcellent result and is fair, reasonable and adequate under Girsh.  See Boone, 668 \nF. Supp. 2d at 713. \nh.   The Recommendation of Class Counsel. \n  Finally, in addition to the Girsh factors discussed above, “several courts have \naccorded significant weight to the view of experienced counsel who have engaged in \narm’s-length negotiations.”  Austin, 876 F. Supp. at 1457 (citing In re Unisys Corp. \nRetiree Medical Benefits ERISA Litig., MDL No. 969, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17877 \n(E.D. Pa. Nov. 3, 1994)).  The recommendation of Class counsel in this case that the \nSettlement be approved should, accordingly, be considered by the Court.  See id. at \n1472-73 (citing to the experience of Mr. Rudovsky and others, and finding that their \nrecommendation that the settlement be approved “is entitled to great weight.”).    \nIV.     CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs and Defendant respectfully request that \nthis Court enter an Order that: (1) provides final approval to the Settlement as fair, \nreasonable and adequate, and (2) certifies the Class action with respect to the \nclaims against Defendant pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a) and FED. R. CIV. P. \n23(b)(3) for the purpose of effectuating a class action settlement of the claims \nagainst the Defendants.   \n \n \n \n/ \n/ \n/ \n  - 35 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 66    Filed 09/27/10   Page 47 of 48\n \nDated: September 27,  2010 \nRespectfully submitted, \nFOR PLAINTIFFS AND THE CLASS:     FOR DEFENDANT: \n/s/ David Rudovsky           /s/ Carolyn P.

INTRODUCTION \n \n  Defendant, The GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”), moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s \nAmended Complaint for failing to state any claims upon which relief may be granted for the \nreasons set forth in the recent Eleventh Circuit en banc decision of Powell v. Barrett, No. 05-\n16734, __ F.3d __, 2008 WL 4072800 (11th Cir. Sept. 4, 2008) (en banc). \n  Plaintiffs Penny Allison and Zoran Hocevar (collectively “Plaintiffs”) in their Complaint \nallege that GEO had a “blanket” search policy, whereby all pre-trial detainees arriving at various \njails across the country were strip searched without regard to the nature of the offense with which \nthey were charged, and without any individualized suspicion that the detainee was secreting \ncontraband.  Many United States Circuit Courts have incorrectly interpreted the United States \nSupreme Court’s decision in Bell v. Wolfish, finding that Bell requires a particularized showing \nof reasonable suspicion to justify any strip search of a detainee by a correctional officer.1  Under \nthis reasoning, a blanket policy of strip searching all arriving pre-trial detainees would be \nunconstitutional. \n  This individualized suspicion “rule” developed in the lower courts, however, directly \ncontravenes the Bell Court’s holding.  In Bell, the Supreme Court upheld a “blanket” strip-search \npolicy that did not require any individualized showing of reasonable suspicion.  The analysis \ndictated by Bell focuses on the reasonableness of strip search policies in the correctional setting, \nnot on the individual circumstances of each search.  Under Bell, GEO’s policy is constitutional. \n                                                 \n1 The Third Circuit has never ruled on the constitutionality of a blanket strip search policy for incoming pretrial \ndetainees.  District courts within the Third Cicuit have held that blanket strip search policies were unconstitutional.  \nSee, e.g., Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F. Supp. 772, 778 (E.D. Pa. 1993).   \n   \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 5 of 18\n  Since Bell, other Supreme Court decisions set forth a less stringent standard than Bell, \nmandating that correctional policies affecting pretrial detainees’ constitutionally protected \ninterests may be upheld if found “reasonably related to a legitimate penological goal.”   \n  Plaintiffs’ entire Complaint is wholly derived from the lower courts’ incorrect \ninterpretation of Bell.  As the GEO policy is constitutional under the correct interpretation of \nBell, as expressed in Powell, all of Plaintiffs’ claims must be dismissed. \nII.  ALLEGATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT \n \nA.  Factual Allegations of the Named Plaintiffs. \n1.  Penny Allison \n  Plaintiff  Allison  (“Allison”)  contends  that  she  was  arrested  for  driving  under  the \ninfluence (“DUI”) in November 2005.  Amended Complaint ¶ 25.  She contends that she was \nplaced into Pennsylvania’s Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program (“ARD”).  Amended \nComplaint ¶ 25.  Allison paid court costs in July 2006, but contends that she failed to appear for \nthe required ARD hearing.  Amended Complaint ¶ 25; Pa. R. Crim. P. 312, 313.  The missed \ncourt hearing resulted in a bench warrant being issued for Allison’s arrest.  Amended Complaint \n¶ 26. \n  During a traffic stop for expired registration by Springfield Township Police on July 25, \n2006,  Allison  was  arrested  for  the  failure-to-appear  outstanding  bench  warrant.    Amended \nComplaint ¶ 26.  Upon her arrest, she was ultimately brought to George W. Hill Correctional \nFacility  in  Delaware  County  (“GWH”).    Amended  Complaint  ¶  26.    Alison  was  released \napproximately eight days later.  Amended Complaint ¶ 28. \n  Allison further contends that she was later arrested again for another unrelated DUI, to \nwhich she pled guilty.  Amended Complaint ¶ 29.  She entered into a DUI weekend program at \n  - 2 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 6 of 18\nGWH  in  November  2007,  serving  her  conviction  over  approximately  fifteen  weekends.  \nAmended Complaint ¶ 29.   \n2.  Zoran Hocevar \n  Zoran Hocevar (“Hocevar”) was arrested in March 2005 after a domestic dispute with his \nwife.  Amended Complaint ¶ 32.  In August 2007, he contends that all of his charges were \ndismissed except the charge for harassment.  Amended Complaint ¶ 32.  On June 26, 2006, a \nbench warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to appear for a required court hearing.  \nAmended Complaint ¶ 33.  In July 2007, Hocevar was stopped “in his car” – apparently for a \nroutine traffic violation – and was arrested pursuant to the outstanding bench warrant.  Amended \nComplaint ¶ 34.  \nB.  Allegations Regarding GEO’s Strip Search Policy. \n \nPlaintiffs contend that GEO has employed a “uniform practice and procedure of strip \nsearching all pre-trial detainees who enter the Facilities, regardless of the crime or violation for \nwhich they are detained, and without making the legally required determination of whether \nreasonable suspicion exists to justify a strip search (‘the Illegal Strip Search Practice or \nPolicy’).”  Amended Complaint (“Am. Compl.”) ¶ 1.  Plaintiffs contend that the Fourth \nAmendment prohibits such strip searches, and that “reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip \nsearch can only emanate from the particular circumstances attendant to the search.”  Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 20-21.  Plaintiffs contend that GEO had a “company-wide” policy, practice or custom of \n“uniformly strip searching  all individuals placed into the custody of the Facilities without any \ndemonstration or finding of reasonable suspicion.”  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 22, 42.  \nNamed Plaintiff Penny Allison contends that as a part of the intake process, she answered \nquestions for about 30 minutes, and was then taken into another room by a female corrections \n  - 3 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 7 of 18\nofficer.  Am. Compl. ¶ 27.  She was instructed to remove all of her clothes, and squat and cough.  \nAm. Compl. ¶ 27.2  Hocevar alleges that he was “subject to a strip search” in a room with other \nmen.  Am. Compl. ¶ 34.  The Amended Complaint provides no more detail on the manner of the \nstrip searches. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \n \nA.  Federal  Rule  Of  Civil  Procedure  12(c)  Mandates  Dismissal  if  Plaintiffs \nCannot Succeed on Their Claims.               \n \nRule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “after the pleadings are \nclosed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the \npleadings.”  Fed. R. C. P. 12(c).  This motion is timely since the pleadings are closed, and trial is \nnot scheduled. \nA motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) is \ntreated under the identical standard for motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6).  Stocktrans, Inc. v. Rostolder, No. 07-1339, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57323, at *7 (E.D. \nPa. Aug. 7, 2007) (citing Shelly v. Johns-Manville Corp., 798 F.2d 93, 97, n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); \nRegalbuto v. City of Philadelphia, 937 F. Supp. 374, 376 (E.D. Pa. 1995)).  A 12(c) motion may \nbe granted where the moving party establishes that no material issue of fact remains to be \nresolved, and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Id. at *7-8 (citing \nInstitute for Scientific Info., Inc. v. Gordon and Breach, Science Publishers, Inc., 931 F.2d 1002, \n1005 (3d Cir. 1991)).

Id. at *8 (citing Janney \nMontgomery Scott, Inc. v. Shepard Niles, Inc., 11 F.3d 399, 406 (3d Cir. 1993)). \nB.  The Supreme Court’s Bell v. Wolfish Decision Approved Routine, Blanket \nStrip Searches For Pretrial Detainees, Regardless Of The Inmate’s Charges \nAnd Without Any Particular Suspicion That The Detainees Were Harboring \nContraband.                     \n \n  Many lower courts have misinterpreted the Supreme Court case of Bell v. Wolfish as \n“requiring … reasonable suspicion as a condition for detention facility strip searches, especially \nthose that involve body cavity inspections.”   Powell v. Barrett, __ F.3d __, 2008 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 18907, at *21-22 (11th Cir. Sept. 4, 2008) (en banc).  At least eight courts of appeals, \nrelying on Bell, have disapproved “blanket,” uniform strip search policies, holding that “in order \nto strip search such detainees, the arresting officers must have reasonable individualized \nsuspicion that a detainee is carrying or concealing contraband.”  Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F. Supp. \n772, 778 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (relying on other circuit court cases discussing Bell). \n  As recently succinctly stated by the Eleventh Circuit, all of “[t]hose decisions misread \nBell,” and “the Bell decision, correctly read, is inconsistent with the conclusion that the Fourth \nAmendment requires reasonable suspicion before an inmate entering … a detention facility may \nbe subjected to a strip search that includes a body cavity inspection.”  Powell, 2008 U.S. App. \nLEXIS at *23.  Because Bell plays such a vital role in GEO’s demonstration that its blanket strip \nsearch policy is constitutional, the case is summarized here in some detail.3 \n  Bell was a putative class action filed on behalf of all persons detained in the Metropolitan \nCorrectional Center (“MCC”), a federal detention facility located next to the United States \n                                                 \n3 As this is a 12(c) motion, the Court must assume that the facts stated in Plaintiffs’ Complaint are true.  Thus, GEO \nhas so assumed for the purposes of this motion.  Nothing in this motion or memorandum should be construed as \nadmitting, in fact, that a blanket strip search policy or practice exists at any of the facilities involved in this suit; the \nfacts are admitted for the purposes of this procedural context only. \n  - 5 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 9 of 18\nCourthouse for the Southern District of New York.  United States of America ex rel. Louis \nWolfish v. Levi, 439 F. Supp. 114, 119 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (note that when this case eventually \nreached the Supreme Court, it was captioned Bell v. Wolfish).  Plaintiffs included all pre-trial \ndetainees, as well as witnesses in protective custody, prisoners transferred to MCC for trial, \npersons incarcerated for contempt of court, and sentenced prisoners awaiting permanent prison \nassignment or serving terms at MCC.  Id.  The Plaintiffs challenged a wide array of prison \nconditions, among them the fact that strip searches of MCC inmates were routine following \nvisits, contending that this violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  Id. at 146.  \n  Plaintiffs alleged that MCC searched every inmate upon returning to his or her quarters \nafter a visit.  During the visits, “the inmates and their visitors [we]re in full view [of guards] \nduring the visits and fully clad.  The secreting of objects in rectal or genital areas [would have \nbeen] an imposing challenge to nerves and agility.”  Id. at 147.   \n  Nevertheless, all inmates, regardless of their charges (and even witnesses in protective \ncustody who were not charged with any crime), were searched after every visit.  “In the presence \nof a corrections officer, the male inmate must remove his clothes, display his armpits, open his \nmouth, raise his genitals, display the bottoms of his feet, and spread his buttocks for visual anal \ninspection. Female inmates must follow a similar procedure, including a visual vaginal \ninspection.”  Id. at 146.  The district court ordered the prison officials to “cease the routine \nrequirements of anal and genital inspections after visits,” but “left [open] the possibility of \nvisually inspecting anal or genital areas upon a specific and particular demonstration of probable \ncause for doing so.”  Id. at 148.  The court held that there were other means of satisfying the \nMCC’s security concerns, stating that “[i]n all the circumstances, the demands of security are \namply satisfied if inmates [as a routine matter] are required to disrobe, to have their clothing \n  - 6 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 10 of 18\nsubjected to inspection, and to present open hands and arms to demonstrate the absence of \nconcealed objects.” Id.  \n  Noting that the United States had “proved only one instance . . . in the several years of \n[MCC’s] existence when contraband was found during a body cavity inspection,” the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s order halting the routine use of visual body \ncavity searches.  Wolfish v. Levi, 573 F.3d 118, 131 (2nd Cir. 1978).  Relying on Circuit \nprecedent imposing a heightened “compelling necessity” standard to conditions of confinement \nimposed upon pretrial detainees, the Second Circuit found that this standard could not be \nsatisfied by reference to the “fiscal necessity . . . [or] administrative convenience” of the \ncorrectional institution.  Id. at 124. \n  The United States Supreme Court reversed, upholding the routine post-visit anal and \ngenital inspections under both the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.  The Bell \nCourt assumed “for present purposes” that the Fourth Amendment applied to the strip searches, \nmeaning that a “reasonableness test” governed.  Id. at 558.  This reasonableness test “requires a \nbalancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.” Id. at 559.  In applying the test, courts “must consider the scope of the particular \nintrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \nwhich it is conducted.  Id. \n  The Court recognized the scope of the intrusion, finding the searches involved exposing \nbody cavities for visual inspection, including lifting genitalia, spreading buttocks, and inspection \nof vaginal and anal cavities.  Id. at 558 & n.39.  It noted that the Second Circuit had found that \nthe searches amounted to a “‘gross violation of personal privacy.’”  Id. at 558 (quoting Levi, 573 \nF.3d at 131).  As for the manner, the Court “did not doubt” that the visual body cavity searches \n  - 7 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 11 of 18\nhad, on occasion, been conducted in an abusive manner, but found that the MCC general manner \n– absent abuse – was reasonable.  Id. at 560; see also Powell, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18907, at \n*18-21 (explaining the Supreme Court’s analysis as justifying uniform visual body cavity \ninspections of pretrial detainees without cause or suspicion). \n  Nevertheless, and despite stating that the strip search practice “gives us the most pause,” \nthe Court found that the intrusiveness of the search was justified in light of the third and fourth \nfactors – the justification for the searches and the place they were conducted.  Bell, 441 U.S. at \n558-59.  Finding that “[a] detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security \ndangers,” the Court noted that the “[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons and contraband is all \nto common an occurrence.”  Id. at 559.  Such body cavity searches were necessary to discover \nand deter smuggling of weapons, drugs, and contraband.  Id. at 558.  That only one instance \nexisted in the record where any strip search yielded contraband – an MCC inmate was found to \nbe secreting a balloon of heroin in her vaginal cavity after a visit – “may be more a testament to \nthe effectiveness of the search technique as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of \ninmates to secrete and import such items.”  Id. at 559.4 \n  Viewing the ultimate issue as “whether visual body-cavity inspections as conducted by \nthe MCC rules can ever be conducted on less than probable cause,” the court answered in the \naffirmative:  “Balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against \nthe privacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.”  Id. at 560 (emphasis added).  \nThus, MCC could continue to conduct body cavity inspections on all inmates after each visit, \nwithout any cause to suspect contraband.  Id. at 558.   \n                                                 \n4 The Court rejected the district court’s position that less intrusive alternatives existed (such as metal detectors), \nnoting first that the existence of less intrusive alternatives was not a part of the applicable test, and second that the \nmetal detectors would not address the problem of non-metallic contraband.  Id. at 559 n.40. \n  - 8 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 12 of 18\n  Justice Powell took issue with the Court’s holding that such searches could be conducted \nwithout any individualized showing of cause whatsoever, issuing a three-sentence dissent: \nI join in the opinion of the Court except the discussion and holding with respect to \nbody-cavity searches.  In view of the serious intrusion on one’s privacy \noccasioned by such a search, I think at least some level of cause, such as a \nreasonable suspicion, should be required to justify the anal and genital searches \ndescribed in this case.  I therefore dissent on this issue. \n \n441 U.S. at 563 (Powell, J., dissenting) (emphasis added); see also Powell, 2008 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 18907, at *25-27 (discussing Justice Powell’s dissent).  Thus, it is clear that Justice \nPowell understood that the Bell Court’s majority had just authorized routine, uniform strip \nsearches – without any showing of cause.  Justice Marshall understood that too, as evidenced by \nhis dissenting opinion, which stated that “[h]ere, the searches are employed absent any suspicion \nof wrongdoing,” and disagreeing with the majority’s decision to “uphold these indiscriminate \nsearches.”  Id. at 578-78 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).5 \n  Bell therefore establishes that the Fourth Amendment does not require an individualized \nshowing of cause prior to application of a security-related strip-search policy in a correctional \nfacility. Because Plaintiffs’ entire theory of constitutional injury is wholly dependent upon such a \nFourth Amendment requirement, Plaintiffs’ strip-search claims must fail as a matter of law on \ntheir face. \n                                                 \n5 The Powell en banc court also noted that in the thirty years since Bell, the federal Bureau of Prisons continued to \nemploy a blanket visual body cavity inspection policy for pretrial detainees, and no court had attempted to enjoin it.  \n2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18907, at *27-30.  The Powell court called on “[a]ll other courts” to recognize that Bell does \nnot require reasonable suspicion to justify visual body cavity searches.  Id. at *29. \n  - 9 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 13 of 18\nC.  An  En  Banc  Eleventh  Circuit  Recently  Applied  Bell  At  The  Motion  to \nDismiss  Stage,  Finding  that  Bell  Compelled  Dismissal  Of  A  Fourth \nAmendment Claim Challenging A Blanket Strip Search Policy.      \n \nAs a recent Eleventh Circuit en banc opinion clearly demonstrates, a uniform policy of \nstrip searching all pretrial detainees as a part of the booking process does not offend the \nconstitution, and claims alleging so are subject to dismissal at the Rule 12 stage.  In Powell, \neleven former pretrial detainees challenged a blanket strip search policy maintained by a county \njail in Georgia.  2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18907, at *2-3.  Eight of those detainees were strip \nsearched as a part of the intake process, and five of those eight were arrested on charges that \nwould not provide reasonable suspicion for such a search.  Id. at *3.  The district court denied a \nmotion to dismiss, finding that the Plaintiffs’ allegations of a blanket strip search policy were \nsufficient to state a claim.  Id. at *4.  Defendants filed a petition for review under 28 U.S.C. § \n1292(b), which the district court approved and the Eleventh Circuit accepted.  Order (N.D. Ga. \nAug. 15, 2005) (attached as Exhibit 1); Order (11th Cir. Dec. 8, 2005) (attached as Exhibit 2).  \nThe 3-judge Eleventh Circuit panel affirmed the district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss.  \n496 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2007).  The entire Eleventh Circuit voted for rehearing en banc sua \nsponte, vacating the panel opinion.  Powell v. Barrett, 05-16734-EE Docket at 11 (11th Cir.) \n(attached as Exhibit 3). \nThe en banc court reversed, finding that a policy or practice of strip searching all \nincoming pretrial detainees – without cause or suspicion – was constitutional under Bell v. \nWolfish, requiring dismissal of plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims.  2008 U.S. App. LEXIS \n18907, at *1.  In reversing, the en banc court overruled its own precedent, finding that it was \nbased on a misinterpretation of Bell.  Id. at *6-7.  After extensively reviewing the Bell decision’s \nbackground and its language, the en banc panel came to the inescapable conclusion that Bell, \n  - 10 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 14 of 18\n“correctly read, is inconsistent with the conclusion that the Fourth Amendment requires \nreasonable suspicion before an inmate entering or reeentering a detention facility may be subject \nto a strip search that includes a body cavity inspection.”  Id. at *23.  In holding that the courts \n(including itself) had been misinterpreting Bell, the Powell court (1) relied on the fact that the \nBell Court had “categorically upheld” a visual body cavity inspection policy under the Fourth \nAmendment, rejecting a case-by-case analysis, id. at *23-24; (2) found that Justice Powell’s terse \ndissent would have been addressed by the majority if the dissent had incorrectly summarized the \nmajority’s holding, id. at *25-27; and (3) noted that the Bureau of Prisons still to this day \nmaintains a blanket strip search policy, id. at *27-28.   \nThe Powell court focused on Bell’s consideration of the third and fourth factors in the \nanalysis – the justification for the searches and the place they were conducted.  Id. at *19.  \nFinding that “[t]hose two factors merged into one heavy consideration because the searches took \nplace in a detention facility, and the justification for them was the critically important security \nneeds of the facility,” the Eleventh Circuit was convinced that Bell approved blanket strip search \npolicies, provided they were no more intrusive than those in Bell.  Id. at *1, *19.   \nIn reaching its conclusion, the en banc court noted that “[t]he need for strip searches at all \ndetention facilities, including county jails, is not exaggerated.  Employees, visitors, and (not least \nof all) the detained inmates themselves face a real threat of violence, and administrators must be \nconcerned on a daily basis with the smuggling of contraband by inmates accused of \nmisdemeanors as well as those accused of felonies.”  Id. at *34.  The court noted that county jails \nfaced serious gang violence problems, and that where reasonable suspicion has been required, \nthere are instances of contraband being smuggled into jails by those facing less serious charges.  \nId. at *35.  Following the Supreme Court’s mandate that “jailers and corrections officials ‘should \n  - 11 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 15 of 18\nbe accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that \nin their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain \ninstructional security,” the Powell court “recognize[d] Bell as authoritative precedent and \nreach[ed] the result it dictates in this case.”  Id. at *39. \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Should Be Dismissed, As They Are Wholly Based On The \nSame Misinterpretation Of Bell That Was Rejected In Powell By The En \nBanc Eleventh Circuit’s Compelling Decision.           \n \n  Here, Plaintiffs assert that they were subject to an “unconstitutional” blanket strip search \npolicy, made unconstitutional by the sole fact that it was conducted without a reasonable \nsuspicion that they were harboring contraband.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 21-22.  Plaintiff Allison \ncontends that she had to “squat and cough,” and Plaintiff Hocevar alleges that he was “subject to \na strip search.”  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 27, 34.  At most, the searches here are no more intrusive than \nthose in Bell – indeed, it appears the searches here may have been less intrusive.  Levi, 439 F. \nSupp. at 146 (district court decision in Bell) (“In the presence of a corrections officer, the male \ninmate must remove his clothes, display his armpits, open his mouth, raise his genitals, display \nthe bottoms of his feet, and spread his buttocks for visual anal inspection. Female inmates must \nfollow a similar procedure, including a visual vaginal inspection.”).  Moreover, the searches here \nare conducted upon the pretrial detainees’ initial entry into the facility, as opposed to the \nsearches in Bell which were post-visit.  Incoming inmates have not been under any supervision \nwhatsoever, and obviously presents a greater security hazard than someone who has just come \nfrom an observed visit within the institution, as the MCC inmates in Levi had done.  Id. at 146.  \nThe well-known dangers of all detention facilities, combined with due deference to correctional \nofficials, dictate that a strip-search is a reasonable security measure upon placement of inmates \nin the general jail population.  Evans, 407 F.3d at 1288-90. \n  - 12 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 16 of 18\n  Because Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same fundamental misinterpretation of Bell \nas has pervaded the lower courts for years, they must be dismissed.  The en banc Eleventh \nCircuit’s compelling decision corrects the lower courts’ repeated misinterpretation of Bell, and \nthis Court should follow its lead.   \nE.  Subsequent  Supreme  Court  Decisions  Make  Clear  That  An  Even  More \nDeferential Standard Applies To Plaintiffs’ Claims Here, Further Supporting \nDismissal.                     \n \n  In Bell, the Supreme Court assumed, without deciding, that the Fourth Amendment \napplied to pretrial detainee claims based on correctional-setting strip searches.  Bell, 441 U.S. at \n558-60.  Since Bell, however, the Court has decided that the Fourth Amendment does not apply \nin the correctional setting.  Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 527-28 (1984) (“A right of privacy \nin traditional Fourth Amendment terms is fundamentally incompatible with the close and \ncontinual surveillance of inmates and their cells required to ensure institutional security and \ninternal order.”); Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 862 (2006) (Stevens, J., dissenting) \n(admitting that “Hudson v. Palmer does stand for the proposition that ‘[a] right of privacy in \ntraditional Fourth Amendment terms’ is denied individuals who are incarcerated”); see also \nJohnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 146 (7th Cir. 1995) (“Wolfish assumed without deciding that \nprisoners retain some right of privacy under the fourth amendment.  Five years later [in Hudson] \nthe Court held that they do not.”). \n  Because the Fourth Amendment does not apply, Plaintiffs’ claims must be adjudicated \nunder the general standard applicable to regulatory measures in correctional institutions, where \nthe court asks whether the restriction or condition is “reasonably related to legitimate penological \n  - 13 -   \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 29    Filed 09/18/08   Page 17 of 18\ninterests.”  Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 223 (1990);6 see also Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. \n78, 89 (1987); O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 349 (1987).  This test applies “even \nwhen the constitutional right claimed to have been infringed is fundamental, and the State under \nother circumstances would have been required to satisfy a more rigorous standard of review.”  \nHarper, 494 U.S. at 223. \n  Here, as the blanket strip search policy satisfies the more rigorous Bell test, it clearly also \nsatisfies the less stringent test articulated in Harper.  This precedent further supports dismissal of \nPlaintiffs’ claims here. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n \n  This Court should grant The GEO Group, Inc.’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, \ndismiss Plaintiffs’ claims as failing to state any claim upon which relief can be granted, and \ndismiss this action in its entirety with prejudice. \n          Respectfully Submitted, \n          “s”/Carolyn P.

INTRODUCTION\nIn this litigation, plaintiffs, detained arrestees at custodial facilities operated by defendant\nThe GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”), challenge the legality of strip searches conducted by defendants,\nGEO and John Does 1 – 100.1 Plaintiffs allege that the searches were performed pursuant to a\nblanket policy of strip searching all arrestees and that such a policy violates the Fourth\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States. This Memorandum addresses the issues\npresented by defendant GEO’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings which seeks to dismiss\nCounts I, II, and III of plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, those that allege Fourth Amendment\nviolations, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.2 \nPlaintiffs’ cause of action is based on Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Supreme\n1 The Court will use the singular term “defendant” when discussing the alleged strip\nsearch policy promulgated by defendant GEO or the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings filed\nby defendant GEO. The Court will use the plural term “defendants” when discussing individual\nstrip searches conducted by John Doe defendants pursuant to GEO’s alleged strip search policy.\n2 Defendant’s motion does not address Count V of plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint which\nasserts a state law negligence claim. Counts IV, VI, and VII of the Amended Complaint were\npreviously dismissed by agreement of the parties. (Order of May 30, 2008.)\n2\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 3 of 49\nCourt’s seminal case on the rights of pretrial detainees. Among other rulings, Bell established the\nFourth Amendment standard for determining the constitutionality of strip search policies in\ncustodial facilities.3 Applying that standard to a blanket policy which mandated strip searches for\nall inmates returning from contact visits, the Supreme Court upheld the policy as reasonable\nunder the Fourth Amendment. Following Bell, other courts have used the Bell standard to assess\nthe constitutionality of custodial strip search policies in various contexts. Plaintiffs’ claims rely\non those cases which, in assessing custodial strip searches in the arrestee context, strike down\nblanket polices and the suspicionless searches conducted under those blanket polices as\nunreasonable and, therefore, unconstitutional. \nDefendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings advances three alternative grounds for\ndismissal. First, defendant argues that plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims must fail because,\nunder Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984), inmates in custodial facilities do not possess\nFourth Amendment rights. Second, in the event that the Court rejects defendant’s Hudson\nargument, defendant argues that the Court should adjudicate and dismiss plaintiffs’ claims\naccording to the standard of review articulated in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), for prison\nregulations which impinge on inmates’ constitutional rights, and not according to Bell’s Fourth\nAmendment standard. Finally, defendant asserts that, even if the Court rejects both of the\nforegoing arguments and, instead, applies the Bell standard, the outcome in this case is governed\nby the outcome in Bell, in which the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a blanket strip\nsearch policy. In arguing for this application of Bell, defendant relies almost exclusively on\n3 For purposes of this Memorandum, the Court uses the term “custodial facility” to refer\ncollectively to jails, prisons, and other detention facilities. The Court uses the term “custodial\nstrip search” to mean a strip search conducted in a custodial facility for non-investigatory\npurposes. \n3\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 4 of 49\nPowell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc), a recently issued en banc opinion by\nthe Eleventh Circuit which runs directly counter to the holdings of nine other circuits on this\nissue. \nAlthough the issues before the court have been addressed by many circuit courts, the\nThird Circuit has never ruled on the constitutionality of strip searches in detention facilities. This\nCourt must, therefore, look to other circuits for persuasive authority. For the reasons stated in this\nMemorandum, the Court rejects defendant’s Hudson and Turner arguments and declines to adopt\nthe Eleventh Circuit’s holding in Powell. This Court concludes that under the persuasive\nauthority of nine courts of appeals, plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief. Accordingly,\ndefendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings must be denied. \nII. BACKGROUND\nA.   Procedural History\nPlaintiffs commenced this action by filing a Complaint against GEO and John Does 1 –\n100 in their official and individual capacities on January 30, 2008. On March 28, 2008, plaintiffs\nfiled an Amended Complaint against the same defendants. The Amended Complaint asserts the\nfollowing causes of action against all defendants:\nCount I: Monetary damages for Fourth Amendment violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 \nCount II:  Demand for declaratory judgment as to Fourth Amendment violations\nCount III:  Demand for preliminary and permanent injunction as to Fourth Amendment\nviolations\nCount IV: Battery\nCount V:  Negligence \nCount VI: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\nCount VII: Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress\nOn May 2, 2008, GEO filed an unopposed Motion to Dismiss Counts IV, VI, and VII of\n4\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 5 of 49\nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint. By Order dated May 30, 2008, the Court dismissed those Counts\nwith prejudice. Defendant’s motion to dismiss did not challenge any of plaintiffs’ federal claims\n(Counts I-III) or plaintiffs’ state law negligence claim (Count V). On June 19, 2008, GEO filed\nan Answer to the remaining Counts of plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, and the parties proceeded\nto conduct discovery.\nOn September 18, 2008, soon after the issuance of Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th\nCir. 2008) (en banc) on September 4, 2008, GEO filed the instant motion for judgment on the\npleadings. In conjunction with the motion for judgment on the pleadings, defendant filed a\nMotion for a Protective Order and Stay of Discovery. By Order dated October 10, 2008, the\nCourt granted in part and denied in part defendant’s Motion for a Protective Order and Stay of\nDiscovery, partially staying discovery pending the Court’s ruling on the Motion for Judgment on\nthe Pleadings.\nB.   Factual Background4\nGEO, a Florida corporation, manages numerous correctional, detention, mental health,\nand residential treatment facilities in the United States (“Facilities”), including the George W.\nHill Correctional Facility in Thornton, Pennsylvania (“Hill Facility”). (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 15-16, 26,\n36.) Plaintiffs aver that in operating its Facilities, defendant has a written or de facto policy of\nstrip searching “all individuals placed into the custody of the Facilities” including recently\narrested individuals and pretrial detainees. (Id. ¶ 22.) The searches are allegedly conducted\nregardless of the existence of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that any particular\nindividual is carrying weapons or contraband on his person. (Id. ¶¶ 22-23.) \n4 This Memorandum recites only those factual allegations contained in the Amended\nComplaint that are necessary for the determination of the instant motion. All facts are presented\nin the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the non-moving party.\n5\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 6 of 49\nPlaintiffs Penny Allison (“Allison”) and Zoran Hocevar (“Hocevar”) each allege that they\nwere subjected to strip searches that were not based on reasonable suspicion. Plaintiffs further\nallege that a class of similarly situated individuals were subjected to strip searches under similar\ncircumstances, in accordance with the blanket policy and without reasonable suspicion. (Id. ¶¶\n23, 45.) The facts, as they pertain to each named plaintiff and the putative plaintiff class, are as\nfollows.\n1.   Penny Allison\nPlaintiff Allison was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (“DUI”) in\nNovember 2005. (Am. Compl. ¶ 25.) In lieu of formal prosecution, Allison was placed in a\npretrial diversion program known as Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (“ARD”). (Id.) In or\naround July 2006, Allison failed to appear for one of her ARD-related court dates, and a bench\nwarrant issued. (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.) \nOn July 25, 2006, police officers in Springfield, Pennsylvania stopped Allison for driving\nwith an expired registration sticker and arrested her on the outstanding bench warrant. (Id. ¶ 26.)\nFollowing arrest, Allison was transferred to the Hill Facility. (Id.) As part of the intake process, a\nfemale officer escorted Allison to a private room and instructed her to remove her clothing,\nsquat, and cough. (Id. ¶ 27.) Allison remained in custody for eight days. (Id. ¶¶ 27-28.) At\nAllison’s next court date, her attorney explained her failure to appear at the earlier court date, and\nthe court ordered that she be released from detention at the Hill Facility. (Id. ¶ 28.)\nIn or around December 2007, Allison pled guilty to a second DUI charge and was\nsentenced to fifteen weekends of incarceration. At the time the Amended Complaint was filed,\nAllison had begun serving her sentence by reporting each weekend to the Hill Facility. On each\noccasion, Allison was ushered into a room along with all of the other female weekend inmates.\n6\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 7 of 49\nOne by one, a corrections officer strip searched each inmate in front of the others. (Id. ¶ 29.)  \n2.   Zoran Hocevar\nIn or around March 2005, Plaintiff Hocevar was arrested on charges arising out of a\ndomestic dispute. All but one of the related charges were dismissed some time between March\n2005 and June 2006.5 Thinking that all of the charges had been resolved, Hocevar mistakenly\nfailed to appear for a scheduled court date in June 2006. A bench warrant issued. (Am. Compl. ¶\n33.)\nPolice officers in Montgomery County stopped Hocevar’s vehicle in July 2007. (Id. ¶ 34.)\nUpon discovering the outstanding bench warrant, the officers took Hocevar into custody and\ntransported him to the Hill Facility. (Id.) During his admission to the Hill Facility, Hocevar was\nstrip searched in the presence of other individuals. (Id.)\n3.   Plaintiff Class\nPlaintiffs define the proposed class as:\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of one or more of\nthe Facilities after being detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses, or other\ncrimes that do not involve the possession or distribution of drugs, possession of\nweapons, or violent felonies, and who were or will be strip searched upon their\nadmission into one or more of the Facilities pursuant to Defendants’ . . . uniform\npractice and procedure of strip searching all pre-trial detainees who enter the\nFacilities, regardless of the crime or violation for which they are detained, and\nwithout making the legally required determination of whether reasonable\nsuspicion exists to justify a strip search. \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 45.) The salient features of the putative class, for the purposes of ruling on the\ninstant motion are as follows. First, class plaintiffs are minor offenders and/or non-violent, non-\ndrug offenders. Second, class plaintiffs are detained arrestees or pretrial detainees. Finally, class\n5 The Amended Complaint states that the charges were dropped in “August of 2007,” but\nthis date appears to be erroneous in that it does not match Hocevar’s chronology of events.   \n7\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 8 of 49\nplaintiffs are subjected to strip searches which are conducted pursuant to a blanket policy and\nlack individualized reasonable suspicion. (Id. ¶¶ 22-23.) The Court also notes that plaintiffs do\nnot describe the nature of the strip searches mandated by the blanket policy or specify whether\nthe policy requires the inspection of body cavities.\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nA motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) is\nanalyzed under the same standard as a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6).  See Shelly v. Johns-Manville Corp., 798 F.2d 93, 97 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); Regalbuto v.\nCity of Phila., 937 F. Supp. 374, 376 (E.D. Pa. 1995). A motion for judgment on the pleadings\nwill only be granted where “the plaintiffs would not be entitled to relief under any set of facts\nthat could be proved.” Green v. Fund Asset Mgmt., L.P., 245 F.3d 214, 220 (3d Cir. 2001).  In\ndetermining whether a plaintiff has stated a claim for relief, the court must view the facts and\ninferences to be drawn from the pleadings in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. \nInst. for Scientific Info., Inc. v. Gordon & Breach, Sci. Publishers, Inc., 931 F.2d 1002, 1005 (3d\nCir. 1991).\nA motion for judgment on the pleadings, like a motion to dismiss, tests the legal\nsufficiency of a claim in light of the facts pled in the complaint. To survive such a motion, “a\ncivil plaintiff must allege facts that ‘raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . .’”\nVictaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,\n127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007)).  In other words, a claim must contain “‘enough factual matter\n(taken as true) to suggest’” the elements of the claims asserted. Phillips v. County of Allegheny,\n515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir. 2008) (quoting Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965); accord 5 Wright &\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1216, at 236 (3d ed. 2004) (“[T]he pleading must\n8\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 9 of 49\ncontain something more [than] a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion [of] a legally\ncognizable right of action.”), quoted in Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965. \nIV. DISCUSSION\nDefendant’s three grounds for dismissal implicate the legal standard to be applied to\nplaintiffs’ claims and the application of that standard. The Court begins by providing a brief\nsummary of relevant Fourth Amendment principles and then addresses each of defendant’s\narguments in turn.\nA. Legal Standard for Assessing the Constitutionality of Custodial Strip\nSearches Under the Fourth Amendment\n1.  Fourth Amendment Rights Generally\nThe fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to “safeguard the privacy and\nsecurity of individuals against arbitrary invasions” at the hands of the government. Camara v.\nMun. Ct. of S.F., 387 U.S. 523, 528 (1967). To differentiate between unconstitutional invasions\nand constitutionally permissible searches, the Fourth Amendment “impose[s] a standard of\n‘reasonableness’ upon the exercise of discretion by government officials.” Delaware v. Prouse,\n440 U.S. 648, 653-54 (1979). Reasonableness, an inherently flexible standard, generally requires\nbalancing the “intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests” against the “promotion\nof legitimate government interests.” Id. at 654. The standard “is not capable of precise definition\nor mechanical application.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. In each case, the court must determine whether\nthe challenged search is reasonable under the particular facts and circumstances before the court.\nId.; Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968).\nIn broad terms, the Fourth Amendment has two areas of application. The first, and more\ncommon, context involves the individualized search of a person or his belongings, typically in\nrelation to a criminal investigation. In such cases, “the reasonableness standard usually requires,\n9\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 10 of 49\nat a minimum, that the facts upon which an intrusion is based be capable of measurement against\n‘an objective standard,’ whether this be probable cause or a less stringent test.” Prouse, 440 U.S.\nat 654; accord City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 37 (2000). In a later opinion, the\nCourt ruled that there are only two objective standards for the purposes of the Fourth\nAmendment—probable cause and reasonable suspicion. United States v. Montoya de Hernandez,\n473 U.S. 523, 540-41 (1985).\nThe second context involves suspicionless searches conducted pursuant to search\npolicies. “In [some] situations . . . the balance of interests precludes insistence upon ‘some\nquantum of individualized suspicion.’” Prouse, 440 U.S. at 654-55; accord Hudson v. Palmer,\n468 U.S. 517, 537-38 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“In some contexts, . . . the Court has rejected\nthe case-by-case approach to the ‘reasonableness’ inquiry in favor of an approach that determines\nthe reasonableness of contested practices in a categorical fashion.”). These searches are often\nreferred to as “special needs” searches because they serve interests “other than the ordinary needs\nof law enforcement.” Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 313 (1997); Skinner v. Ry. Labor\nExecutives’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 619 (1989). The instant case requires this Court to rule on\nwhether the strip searches alleged by plaintiffs belong to “the closely guarded category of\nconstitutionally permissible suspicionless searches.” Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 309\n(1997).\nBy virtue of plaintiffs’ status as detained arrestees, there are two categories under which\nthe challenged strip searches might fall—searches incident to arrest or searches in detention\nfacilities. The parties, by pleading and motion, have only disputed the law governing the latter\ncategory. The scope of searches incident to arrest remains relevant, however, for determining\nwhat is reasonable in the arrestee context.    \n10\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 11 of 49\nIn a quartet of cases, the Supreme Court discussed the extent of searches incident to\nlawful arrest. In United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973), the Court held that a search\nincident to arrest would not be limited to a frisk for weapons but could include a “full search” of\nthe person for both weapons and evidence. Id. at 227-30. The Robinson Court described the full\nsearch as a “relatively extensive exploration of the person.” Id. at 227 (quoting Terry v. Ohio,\n392 U.S. 1, 25-26 (1968)); see also id. at 221-23 (describing the search at issue in Robinson). In\ntwo subsequent cases, the Court clarified that clothing and possessions could also be searched\nincident to arrest. Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 646-47 (1983) (upholding an inventory\nsearch of an arrestee’s personal property at the stationhouse); United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S.\n800, 802-04 (1974) (upholding the confiscation of an arrestee’s clothing as evidence at the\nstationhouse). In Lafayette, the Court clarified Edwards, stating “[w]e were not addressing in\nEdwards, and do not discuss here, the circumstances in which a strip search of an arrestee may or\nmay not be appropriate.” Lafayette, 462 U.S. at 645-46 & n.2. Finally, in Schmerber v.\nCalifornia, 384 U.S. 853 (1966), a case decided several years before Robinson, the Court ruled\nthat the Fourth Amendment does not permit searches incident to arrest which involve “intrusions\nbeyond the body’s surface,” such as the drawing of blood. Id. at 769. Instead, such searches must\nbe based on probable cause and, absent exigent circumstances, a warrant. Id. at 770-71; see also\nMontoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. at 540-41. \nNo Supreme Court case discusses the constitutionality of strip searches incident to arrest,\nwhich appear to fall between the “full searches” considered by Robinson and the “intrusions\nbeyond the body’s surface” considered by Schmerber. Nevertheless, several circuit courts have\nruled that strip searches are not included in the category of permissible searches incident to\narrest. Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1447-50 (9th Cir. 1991); Mary Beth G. v. City of\n11\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 12 of 49\nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1268-71 (7th Cir. 1984); cf Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 236 (1st\nCir. 1990). As this precedent demonstrates, plaintiffs’ status as arrestees, standing alone, did not\nprovide a constitutional basis for the suspicionless strip searches alleged in the Amended\nComplaint. Defendants argue, however, that plaintiffs’ status as arrestees who were detained in a\ncustodial facility did provide such a basis.   \n2. Fourth Amendment Rights in Custodial Facilities\nDetention and incarceration necessarily require certain limitations on otherwise protected\ncivil liberties. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 524 (1984); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 545-\n46 (1979). In custodial facilities, “[t]he curtailment of certain rights is necessary, as a practical\nmatter, to accommodate a myriad of ‘institutional needs and objectives.’” Hudson, 468 U.S. at\n524. For this reason, the Fourth Amendment rights of inmates are measured differently from\nthose enjoyed by persons who have not been lawfully detained or incarcerated. In fact, because\ncustodial facilities necessarily provide little in the way of personal privacy, Fourth Amendment\nrights, which only exist where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is\nwilling to recognize, are significantly diminished in custodial settings. See Hudson, 468 U.S. at\n525-28; Bell, 441 U.S. at 557.   \nCourts necessarily play a “limited role” in the administration of detention facilities. Block\nv. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 584-85 (1984). As the Bell Court recognized, a “detention facility is\na unique place fraught with serious security dangers.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. Crafting policies\nwhich both address the complex issues of a secure residential institution and resolve the day-to-\nday problems of a high-risk population is a difficult managerial task and one to which courts are\nill-suited. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 387 n.8 (1996); Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401,\n407-08 (1989) (“[T]he judiciary is ‘ill equipped’ to deal with the difficult and delicate problems\n12\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 13 of 49\nof prison management . . . .”). For this reason, “[p]rison administrators . . . should be accorded\nwide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their\njudgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional\nsecurity.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 547-48 (noting not only that prison administrators have “a better\ngrasp of [this] domain” than reviewing judges but also that “the operation of our correctional\nfacilities is peculiarly the province of the Legislative and Executive Branches”). \nIn affording due deference to prison administrators, courts must not, however, abdicate\ntheir duty to protect individuals from government overreaching. “[P]risons are not beyond the\nreach of the Constitution,” Hudson, 468 U.S. at 523, and courts must ensure that the actions and\npolicies of prison officials do not deprive inmates of those constitutional rights that have been\nrecognized to exist in custodial facilities. One such right is the Fourth Amendment protection\nfrom unreasonable custodial strip searches.\n3. Bell Standard for Custodial Strip Searches\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Supreme Court addressed the\nconstitutionality of two types of searches conducted in custodial facilities: cell searches which\ninmates were not permitted to observe and strip searches following contact visits. For both\nsearches, the Court assumed without deciding that “inmates, both convicted prisoners and pretrial\ndetainees, retain some Fourth Amendment rights upon commitment to a corrections facility.” Id.\nat 557, 558. The Court upheld both searches as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id. In\nreviewing the strip search policy, the Court provided the following Fourth Amendment standard.\nNoting that the Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable searches” and that the “test of\nreasonableness . . . requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion\nof personal rights that the search entails,” the Court proceeded to state four factors which courts\n13\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 14 of 49\nmust consider: “[1] the scope of the particular intrusion, [2] the manner in which it is conducted,\n[3] the justification for initiating it, and [4] the place in which it is conducted.” Id. at 559. \nThe Fourth Amendment standard that Bell articulated for custodial strip searches is not\nunique to Bell. The Court affirmed the same balancing approach that it had applied in other\nFourth Amendment contexts. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654 (1979). Further, the Court\nidentified the relevant factors by reference to other cases which questioned the validity of routine,\nnon-investigatory searches and seizures. See, e.g., Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (striking down random,\nsuspicionless car stops); United States v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606 (1977) (upholding suspicionless\nborder searches generally and for international mail); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S.\n543 (1976) (upholding suspicionless car stops made at reasonably located, permanent\ncheckpoints near the border); United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873 (1975) (striking\ndown suspicionless car stops made by roving patrols near the border); Camara v. Mun. Ct. of\nS.F., 387 U.S. 523 (1967) (requiring “area” warrants for building code inspections, but upholding\nsuspicionless searches of individual residences located within the area covered by warrant); Terry\nv. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968) (upholding limited “stop and frisk” procedure on less than probable\ncause, but requiring reasonable suspicion).\nB.  Defendant’s Arguments that Bell No Longer Applies\nSince Bell, most courts faced with challenges to the constitutionality of custodial strip\nsearches have relied on the standard articulated in Bell. See, e.g., Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d\n1298, 1302-03 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997);\nMasters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 (6th Cir. 1989); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 740\n(8th Cir. 1985); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156 (5th Cir. 1985); Hill v. Bogans,\n735 F.2d 391, 393 (10th Cir. 1984); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1271 (7th\n14\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 15 of 49\nCir. 1983); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981). Nevertheless, defendant now\nargues that two Supreme Court cases following Bell, Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984),\nand Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), have so undermined Bell’s Fourth Amendment\napproach to custodial strip searches that Bell no longer controls the adjudication of plaintiffs’\nclaims. For the reasons that follow, this Court rejects both of defendant’s arguments.\n1. Inmates’ Fourth Amendment Rights in Custodial Facilities Under\nHudson v. Palmer\nThe first question before the Court is whether persons who are detained or incarcerated in\ncustodial facilities enjoy the protection of the Fourth Amendment at all. For the contact visit strip\nsearches of pretrial detainees in Bell, the Supreme Court “assume[d without deciding] that\ninmates, both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees, retain some Fourth Amendment rights\nupon commitment to a corrections facility.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 558. Five years later, in Hudson v.\nPalmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526 (1984), the Court revisited the issue of inmates’ Fourth Amendment\nrights in the context of a cell search challenged by a convicted prisoner. The Hudson Court held\nthat “society is not prepared to recognize as legitimate any subjective expectation of privacy that\na prisoner might have in his prison cell and that, accordingly, the Fourth Amendment\nproscription against unreasonable searches does not apply within the confines of the prison cell.”\nHudson, 468 U.S. at 526. Defendant relies on Hudson’s broadest language to argue that the\nHudson holding effectively overrules Bell by rendering all Fourth Amendment claims by inmates\nnon-cognizable. Plaintiffs argue that Hudson is limited to cell searches and does not, therefore,\ndisturb Bell. The parties’ arguments bring into focus the distinction between cell searches and\nstrip searches in custodial facilities.\nIn Hudson, the Court considered a cell search challenged by a convicted inmate and\nquestioned whether the inmate had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his cell which would\n15\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 16 of 49\nentitle him to Fourth Amendment rights. Hudson, 468 U.S. at 522. The Court concluded that the\n“recognition of privacy rights for prisoners in their individual cells simply cannot be reconciled\nwith the concept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of penal institutions.” Id. at 526\n(emphasis added). In reaching this conclusion, the Hudson Court cited Bell with approval and at\nno point overruled Bell’s holding or analysis. Moreover, Hudson does not stand alone. It is one\nof a pair of opinions issued the same day on the constitutionality of cell searches. In the other\ncase, Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984), the Court considered a cell search challenged by\na pretrial detainee. While Hudson does not mention Bell’s Fourth Amendment assumption,\nBlock specifically affirms it with regard to pretrial detainee cell searches. Block, 468 U.S. at 586\n(upholding Bell’s conclusion that prison cell searches do not violate pretrial detainees’ presumed\nFourth Amendment rights).\nThe majority of circuit courts that have considered the relationship between Hudson and\nBell have limited Hudson to cell searches and have held, either explicitly or implicitly, that\nHudson did not disturb Bell’s Fourth Amendment approach to analyzing the constitutionality of\nstrip searches conducted in custodial settings. See Elliot v. Lynn, 38 F.3d 188, 191 n.3 (5th Cir.\n1994) (holding that inmates’ Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable strip searches\nsurvives Hudson); Watsy v. Ames, No. 87-1660, 1988 WL 24978, at *2 (6th Cir. 1988) (ruling\nHudson inapplicable in a strip search case because it “dealt with the search of a cell as opposed\nto the search of an individual”); Forbes v. Trigg, 976 F.2d 308, 312 (7th Cir. 1992) (stating that\n“prison inmates retain protected privacy rights in their bodies, although these rights do not extend\nto their surroundings” and citing Hudson and Bell); Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694, 699 (9th\nCir. 1997) (holding that incarcerated prisoners have Fourth Amendment-protected privacy\ninterests after Hudson and despite Hudson’s broad language); Dunn v. White, 880 F.2d 1188,\n16\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 17 of 49\n1191 (10th Cir. 1989) (holding that even after Hudson, “the prisoner’s privacy interest in the\nintegrity of his own person is still preserved under [Bell]”); Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73, 78\n(2d Cir. 1992) (“While we acknowledge the clear teaching of the Supreme Court’s holding in\nHudson with respect to prison spaces, we believe that maintenance of prison security is not\nburdened unduly by the recognition that inmates do retain a limited right to bodily privacy.”); see\nalso Kent v. Johnson, 821 F.2d 1220, 1226 (6th Cir. 1987) (limiting the Hudson holding to\nprison cells and assessing whether plaintiff prisoner had a reasonable expectation of privacy with\nregard to her person entitling her to Fourth Amendment protection); Bonitz v. Fair, 804 F.2d 164,\n170 & n.6 (1st Cir. 1986), overruled on other grounds by Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F.2d 124 (1st\nCir. 1988) (applying Bell’s Fourth Amendment analysis to a strip search but denying plaintiff’s\ncell search claim under Hudson); Nicholas v. Goord, 430 F.3d 652, 675-76 (2d Cir. 2005)\n(recognizing the distinction between Hudson which denied the availability of Fourth Amendment\nrights as applied to cell searches and Bell which held that the strip searches after contact visits in\nthat case did not violate the Fourth Amendment). But see Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 146\n(7th Cir. 1995) (holding that Hudson overruled Bell’s assumption and abrogated convicted\nprisoners’ Fourth Amendment rights);6 Jones v. Murray, 962 F.2d 302, 306 (4th Cir. 1992)\n(erroneously attributing to Bell the holding that “persons lawfully arrested on probable cause and\ndetained lose a right of privacy from routine searches of the cavities of their bodies”).7 \n6 Eight years after Phelan, the Seventh Circuit applied Bell’s Fourth Amendment analysis\nto a custodial search during which an arrestee was required to strip down to her undergarments\nwhile under the observation of an officer. Stanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961, 964-67 (7th Cir.\n2003). Stanley cited Phelan for the principle that “[o]bservation is a form of search,” but did not\nreference Phelan’s Hudson-Bell holding. Stanley, 337 F.3d at 694 (citing Phelan, 69 F.3d at 145). \n7 The Eighth, Third, and D.C. Circuits have not addressed the relationship between Bell\nand Hudson. \n17\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 18 of 49\nAlthough none of the cases cited above explain the Bell-Hudson relationship in much\ndetail, the vast majority clearly distinguish Hudson from Bell and support the continuing validity\nof Bell with regard to the constitutionality of custodial strip searches. This Court agrees with that\ndistinction. Strip searches of the body, such as those at issue in Bell, inflict a much greater\ninvasion of privacy than searches of prison cells. This fact suggests that the Hudson Court would\nnot overrule, sub silentio, Bell’s implied assumption that pretrial detainees have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy with regard to their own bodies. Although the Supreme Court’s Bell\nholding is based on an assumption that the Fourth Amendment governs strip searches in custodial\nfacilities, that assumption survives Hudson and controls the Court’s review of plaintiffs’ claims.  \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court is particularly mindful of the Supreme Court’s\ncaution in approaching claims that the Fourth Amendment is inapplicable in a given context,\nHudson, 468 U.S. at 525, and of the Supreme Court’s admonition that “[i]f a precedent of this\nCourt has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of\ndecisions, [lower courts] should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the\nprerogative of overruling its own decisions.” Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson / Am. Express,\nInc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989); accord Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236, 252-53 (1998);\nAgostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997). In light of the foregoing, this Court rejects\ndefendant’s argument that plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed on the ground that Hudson\ndeprives inmates of Fourth Amendment rights.\n2.  The Turner v. Safley Standard of Review for Prison Regulations\nDefendant next argues that this Court should employ the standard articulated in Turner v.\nSafely, 482 U.S. 78, 89-91 (1987), for assessing the constitutionality of prison regulations\ngenerally, instead of the more specific Fourth Amendment test that Bell applied to strip searches.\n18\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 19 of 49\nAccording to the Turner standard, defendant’s strip search policy would be constitutional as long\nas “it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 89. The\nSupreme Court elaborated on the standard by enumerating four relevant factors: “whether the\nregulation has a valid, rational connection to a legitimate governmental interest; whether\nalternative means are open to inmates to exercise the asserted right; what impact an\naccommodation of the right would have on guards and inmates and prison resources; and\nwhether there are ready alternatives to the regulation.” Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132\n(2003) (citing Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-91) (internal quotations omitted).\nThe Turner plaintiffs, inmates of a correctional institution in Missouri, challenged certain\nprison regulations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 81. The district court and the court of appeals applied a strict scrutiny\nstandard to plaintiffs’ claims and held the regulations unconstitutional. Id. at 83. The “task”\nfacing the Supreme Court was “to formulate a standard of review for prisoners’ constitutional\nclaims.” Id. at 85. The Supreme Court, rejecting the appropriateness of strict scrutiny for\nreviewing the constitutionality of prison regulations, reversed the lower court holdings and\nsubstituted the modified rational basis standard quoted above. Id. at 81, 89-91. \nTurner, and the Supreme Court cases which apply Turner, concern First and Fourteenth\nAmendment challenges to prison regulations, not Fourth Amendment challenges. Overton v.\nBazzetta, 539 U.S. 126 (2003); O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342 (1987); Washington\nv. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Turner, 482 U.S. 78. Indeed, the standards of review discussed\nin Turner have never had any application in the Fourth Amendment context because the Fourth\n19\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 20 of 49\nAmendment mandates a different standard—reasonableness.8\nAlthough a number of courts, including most courts of appeals, have ruled on the\nconstitutionality of strip searches in custodial facilities, defendant has cited no case which applies\nthe Turner test instead of the Bell test in circumstances similar to those at bar involving arrestees.\nIn fact, only two courts of appeals, the Second and Ninth Circuits, have even addressed Turner’s\napplicability to custodial strip search cases. This Court is not persuaded by the analysis of those\ncircuits.\nThe Ninth Circuit, in Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. 1988), stated that\nTurner “set forth the standard for reviewing alleged infringements of prisoners’ constitutional\nrights,” id. at 331, and purportedly applied that standard to the plaintiff’s claim that he was\nunconstitutionally strip searched at the Nevada state prison. The Michenfelder court’s analysis,\nhowever, relied almost exclusively on the balancing test set forth in Bell. Id. at 331-33. After\nevaluating the reasonableness of the prison’s strip search policy with regard to each of Bell’s four\nfactors, the court concluded by invoking the language of the Turner test. Id. at 333 (affirming the\ndistrict court’s finding that the prison’s “strip search policy was reasonably related to legitimate\npenological interests”). Subsequent Ninth Circuit cases have continued Michenfelder’s practice\nof applying Bell through Turner to strip searches in prisons. See Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d\n694 (9th Cir. 1997);  Cuffle v. Agnos, No. 93-16842, 1994 WL 245935 (9th Cir. 1994);\nThompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1989). The Michenfelder approach\nhas not been adopted by other courts of appeals and, in any case, does not support the more\ndeferential review that defendant seeks by arguing for the application of Turner in this case. \n8 This Court is not aware of any Supreme Court opinions which even mention standards\nof review, such as strict scrutiny or rational basis, when ruling on Fourth Amendment challenges,\nmuch less any cases which actually apply such a standard to a Fourth Amendment challenge.\n20\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 21 of 49\nThe Second Circuit applies both Bell and Turner to claims involving custodial strip\nsearches but differentiates based on the type of facility. It restricts Turner to cases involving\nprison regulations, Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 171-72 (2d Cir. 2007), and analyzes strip search\npolicies in jails using the Bell balancing test, Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 65-66 (2d Cir.\n2001).9 The Second Circuit developed the distinction between “prisons” and “jails” to reconcile\nits own prior treatment of custodial strip search cases, and it provides little support for\ndefendant’s argument that this Court should apply Turner in the instant case. See Iqbal, 490 F.3d\nat 172; Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d at 65-66. Indeed, other Second Circuit cases express doubt as\nto the appropriateness of the Turner test for evaluating Fourth Amendment claims and claims by\npretrial detainees, regardless of the type of facility. N.G. v. Connecticut, 382 F3d 225, 235 (2d\nCir. 2004) (“[T]here is some basis for doubting that the Turner standard applies to a claim of\nconstitutional protection from state action such as a strip search. Turner concerned prisoners’\nassertion of affirmative rights [under the First and Fourteenth Amendments].”); Benjamin v.\nFrazer, 264 F.3d 175, 187 n.10 (2d Cir. 2001) (questioning whether Turner’s focus on\n“penological interests” provides an “appropriate guide” for assessing constitutional claims by\npretrial detainees). The Second Circuit decisions on this issue do not persuade this Court to apply\nTurner to the facts at bar.\nUltimately, defendant’s Turner argument fails for the same reason that defendant’s\nHudson argument failed. Like Hudson, Turner cited Bell with approval and did not at any point\n9 The Second Circuit uses Black’s Law Dictionary to define “prisons” and “jails”: “A\nprison is ‘[a] state or federal facility of confinement for convicted criminals, esp[ecially] felons.’\nA jail, on the other hand, is ‘[a] place where persons awaiting trial or those convicted of\nmisdemeanors are confined.’” Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d at 65 (internal citations omitted); see\nalso Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d at 172 (concluding that the Metropolitan Detention Center in\nBrooklyn, NY was “most like a prison” because the plaintiff “was confined for an extended\nperiod of time in a prison-like environment” and was apparently “charged with felonies”).\n21\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 22 of 49\nsuggest that Bell’s approach to Fourth Amendment claims should no longer be controlling law.\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 87 (citing to the portions of Bell which discussed petitioners’ First\nAmendment claims). This Court will not disregard controlling Supreme Court precedent that has\nnot been specifically overruled by subsequent Supreme Court cases. See Powell, 541 F.3d at\n1302 (declining to apply the Turner test to custodial strip searches on this ground); cf Johnson v.\nCalifornia, 543 U.S. 499, 509-10 (2005) (holding that Turner did not “cast doubt on” the Court’s\nprevious holding that strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications in prisons). Like the many\ncourts that have addressed the constitutionality of custodial strip searches, this Court is guided by\nBell and its progeny. \nC. The Constitutionality of Suspicionless Arrestee Strip Searches in Custodial\nFacilities\nHaving determined that Bell’s Fourth Amendment standard is the appropriate test by\nwhich to measure the viability of plaintiffs’ claims, the Court now turns to the constitutionality of\nsuspicionless arrestee strip searches under that standard. Prior to the issuance of Powell v.\nBarrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc), the numerous opinions of nine other circuit\ncourts clearly established that the Fourth Amendment prohibits suspicionless arrestee strip\nsearches. See, e.g., Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 397-99 (10th Cir. 1993) (rejecting\ndefendant’s qualified immunity claim); Masters v. Couch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1257 (6th Cir. 1989)\n(same); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 803-04 (2d Cir. 1986) (same); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d\n739, 742 n.4 (8th Cir. 1985) (same). The consensus was that arrestee strip searches in custodial\nfacilities must be based on reasonable suspicion. See, e.g., Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d\nCir. 1986); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam), overruled on\nother grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 1999). Dismissing the\nvirtually unanimous circuit precedent on this issue, the Eleventh Circuit, in Powell, ruled that\n22\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 23 of 49\nsuspicionless arrestee strip searches do not violate the Fourth Amendment and that all opinions\nto the contrary misread Bell. Powell, 541 F.3d at 1302, 1306-1307. Defendant now argues that\nthis Court should “join Powell in standing against [the] litany of incorrectly[ ]decided cases.”\n(Def. Reply at 10.) \nAfter conducting a thorough review of Bell, the circuit court cases following Bell, and\nPowell, this Court is unconvinced by the reasoning of the Eleventh Circuit and rejects\ndefendant’s argument that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under Bell and its progeny. To\nfully explain its rejection of the Powell opinion, this Court must describe, at some length, the\nSupreme Court’s holding in Bell and the reasoning of the circuit opinions which followed Bell.   \n1.  The Constitutionality of Contact Visit Strip Searches Under Bell v.\nWolfish\nThe Bell opinion primarily concerns the Due Process right “to be free from punishment”\nduring pretrial detention and the Supreme Court’s assessment of whether particular prison\npractices constitute punishment. Bell, 441 U.S. at 534. In addition, however, the Supreme Court\nruled on practices that were alleged to violate various express guarantees of the Constitution,\nincluding the practice of strip searching all pretrial detainees after contact visits which was\nalleged to violate the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court’s analysis of the challenged strip\nsearch policy, a subject of significant controversy after Powell, is outlined below. The important\nquestions, for present purposes, are (1) whether the Court approved suspicionless searches or\nrequired some level of individualized suspicion and (2) whether the Court’s holding applies to all\ncustodial strip search policies and not just the contact visit strip search policy at issue in Bell. \nBell began as a class action petition10 which challenged certain conditions of confinement\n10 The petitioners filed a petition for a writ for habeas corpus that was later certified as a\nclass action. Despite this unusual procedural posture, the Supreme Court addressed petitioners’\n23\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 24 of 49\nat the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), a custodial facility in New York City. Bell, 441\nU.S. at 523. The Bell petitioners were federal pretrial detainees who had been detained pursuant\nto a determination by a federal judge that no less drastic means could reasonably ensure their\npresence at trial. Id. at 524 (citing the Bail Reform Act of 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-465, § 3, 80 Stat.\n214, 214). The MCC also housed convicted prisoners, persons in protective custody, and persons\nincarcerated for contempt, but they were not parties to the Supreme Court proceeding. Id. at 524,\n529-30.  The petition “served up a veritable potpourri of complaints that implicated virtually\nevery facet of the institution’s conditions and practices,” including the MCC’s policy and\npractice of strip searching inmates after each contact visit. Id. at 527-28, 558. These searches\ninvolved both the removal of all clothing and the visual inspection of body cavities. Id. at 558 &\nn.39 \nAt trial on the constitutionality of the MCC’s contact visit strip searches, the district court\napproved the blanket policy with regard to the observation of inmates’ naked bodies but held that\nit was unconstitutional to the extent that it authorized visual body cavity searches absent probable\ncause to believe that the inmate was concealing contraband. United States ex rel. Wolfish v. Levi,\n439 F. Supp. 114, 148 (S.D.N.Y. 1977). The Second Circuit affirmed. Wolfish v. Levi, 573 F.2d\n118, 131 (2d Cir. 1978). Consequently, the question before the Supreme Court was “whether\nvisual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by the MCC rules [for contact visit strip\nsearches] can ever be conducted on less than probable cause.” Bell, 441 at 560 (emphasis in\noriginal). The Court answered that question in the affirmative, holding that the MCC’s blanket\npolicy of searching all inmates after contact visits was reasonable.\nclaims on the merits. Bell, 441 U.S. at 526 & nn.5-6 (“[W]e leave to another day the question of\nthe propriety of using a writ of habeas corpus to obtain review of the conditions of\nconfinement . . . .”).\n24\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 25 of 49\nThe Court began its analysis of the strip search issue by admitting that “this practice\ninstinctively gives us the most pause.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 558. The Court then proceeded to assess\nthe reasonableness of the challenged search policy by balancing “the need for the particular\nsearch against the invasion of personal rights that the search entail[ed].” Id. at 559. The Court\nconsidered “the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.” Id. As discussed in Part IV.A\nof this Memorandum, the above standard is a version of the test that the Supreme Court has\ndeveloped for assessing the reasonableness of “special needs” searches—those which can be\nconducted without the Fourth Amendment’s default requirement of individualized suspicion. \nWith regard to the scope of the intrusion, the Bell Court described the searches as\nfollows: “If the inmate is a male, he must lift his genitals and bend over to spread his buttocks for\nvisual inspection. The vaginal and anal cavities of female inmates also are visually inspected.\nThe inmate is not touched by security personnel at any time during the visual search procedure.”\nBell, 441 U.S. at 558 n.39 (emphasis in original). The Court stated that it did “not underestimate\nthe degree to which these searches may invade the personal privacy of inmates” and quoted the\nSecond Circuit’s view that such searches represent a “‘gross violation of personal privacy.’” Id.\nat 558, 560 (quoting Wolfish v. Levi, 573 F.2d 118, 131 (2d Cir. 1978)). With regard to the\nmanner of the searches, the Court observed that the district court had found some evidence of\nabuse. Id. at 560. Declaring that “[s]uch an abuse cannot be condoned,” the Court restricted its\nreview to searches conducted in an appropriate manner pursuant to the MCC policy. Id.  \nOn the other side of the equation were the needs of the institution. The Court\ncharacterized detention facilities as “unique place[s] fraught with serious security dangers” and\ndescribed the risks posed by the smuggling of money, drugs, and weapons. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.\n25\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 26 of 49\nCorrections officials justified the searches by stating that they were necessary both to detect\ncontraband exchanged and concealed during contact visits and to deter the smuggling of\ncontraband during contact visits. Id. at 558. At trial, the evidence showed that the MCC strip\nsearches had successfully detected contraband only once, but the Court found this evidence\ninconclusive because it could “be more a testament to the effectiveness of this search technique\nas a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and import such\nitems when the opportunity arises.” Id. at 559.\nDespite the highly intrusive nature of the searches, the Court found that the inmates’\nprivacy interests were outweighed by the “significant and legitimate security interests of the\ninstitution” and upheld the MCC’s contact visit strip search policy as reasonable. Bell, 441 U.S.\nat 558, 560. In upholding a blanket policy, the Court concluded that custodial strip searches\ncould “be conducted on less than probable cause” and, indeed, that they could be conducted\nwithout any individualized assessment of cause. Id. at 560. Essentially, the Court placed the\nMCC’s contact visit strip searches in the “closely guarded category of constitutionally\npermissible suspicionless searches,” Chandler, 520 U.S. at 309, which are reasonable based on\nthe government needs at stake and not because the government has cause for each individual\nsearch. Because the Court determined that the blanket policy was reasonable on the facts before\nit, it had no occasion to rule on what factual circumstances might make a custodial strip search\npolicy unreasonable. It also had no reason to require a particular level of individualized\nsuspicion—reasonable suspicion or probable cause—in order to uphold custodial strip searches\nthat would be unreasonable if suspicionless. \n2.  Circuit Court Rulings on Arrestee Strip Searches in Custodial\nFacilities\nBy the time the Eleventh Circuit decided Powell, nine other circuits had applied the Bell\n26\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 27 of 49\nstandard in cases involving recently arrested persons who were subjected to suspicionless strip\nsearches upon admission to a custodial facility and ruled that such searches were\nunconstitutional. Powell correctly notes that while these decisions “vary in detail around the\nedges, the picture they paint is essentially the same.” Powell, 541 F.3d at 1309. In each case, a\nperson is arrested on charges which do not involve narcotics or violence. In some cases, the\ncharges were relatively minor. See, e.g., Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 67 (2d Cir. 1988) (failure\nto pay parking tickets); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 154 n.1 (5th Cir. 1985)\n(public intoxication and issuance of a bad check); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 740 (8th Cir.\n1985) (leash law violation). In other cases, the charges were more serious. See, e.g., Logan v.\nShealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1009 (4th Cir. 1981) (DUI); Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep’t, 901\nF.2d 702, 704 (9th Cir. 1990), overruled on other grounds by Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224\n(1991) (grand theft). After arrest, the person is taken to a police station, jail, or other detention\nfacility. At that facility, the person is strip searched as part of the intake or admission process.\nThe scope of the strip searches varied. See, e.g., Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 393 (10th Cir.\n1984) (arrestee instructed to drop pants and shorts); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 615 (9th\nCir. 1984) (per curiam), overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d\n1037 (9th Cir. 1999) (visual observation of arrestee’s naked body); Mary Beth G. v. City of\nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1266-67 (7th Cir. 1984) (visual body cavity inspection). Soon\nthereafter, the person is released.\nAlthough it is difficult to precisely characterize the collective holdings of these cases,\nespecially considering the fact-sensitive nature of reasonableness analysis, suffice it to say that all\nnine circuits found suspicionless strip searches of recently arrested persons unreasonable and\ntherefore unconstitutional. Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997); Masters v. Crouch,\n27\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 28 of 49\n872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986); Jones v.\nEdwards, 770 F.2d at 741-42; Stewart, 767 F.2d at 156-57; Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d at 617;\nHill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d at 394-95; Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273; Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d\nat 1013.11 These courts held that, to be reasonable, custodial strip searches of detained arrestees\nmust be predicated on reasonable suspicion. The “[r]easonable suspicion may be based on such\nfactors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest\nrecord.” Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d at 617. \nIn none of the cases cited above did the court determine that Bell’s reasonableness ruling\nwith regard to the MCC’s contact visit strip searches controlled the reasonableness of custodial\nstrip searches in other contexts. Rather, each court recited Bell’s Fourth Amendment standard\nand then proceeded to apply that standard to the facts before it. In balancing “the need for the\nparticular search against the invasion of rights that the search entails,” courts considered the\nfactors identified by Bell (“the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is\nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted”) and\nconsidered the Bell Court’s analysis of those factors. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. From the ample\n11 Most circuits have also affirmed the holdings of the above-cited cases in subsequent\nopinions. As the Court noted in the Introduction, the Third Circuit has not ruled on the\nconstitutionality of custodial arrestee strip searches. Several district courts in the Third Circuit\nhave ruled on this issue, however. Those opinions also hold that suspicionless custodial strip\nsearches of detained arrestees violate the Fourth Amendment. Florence v. Bd. of Chosen\nFreeholders of Burlington, No. 05-3619, 2009 WL 252174, at *16 (D.N.J. Feb. 4, 2009);\nMartinez v. Warner, No. 07-3213, 2008 WL 2331957, at *14-15 (E.D. Pa. June 5, 2008);\nNewkirk v. Sheers, 834 F. Supp. 772, 789-90 (E.D. Pa. 1993); Ernst v. Borough of Fort Lee, 739\nF. Supp. 220, 224 (D.N.J. 1990); O’Brien v. Borough of Woodbury Heights, 679 F. Supp. 429,\n434 (D.N.J. 1988); Davis v. City of Camden, 657 F. Supp. 396, 401 (D.N.J. 1987). In addition,\nthis Court has previously ruled, based on then-prevailing precedent, that blanket strip search\npolicies violate detained arrestees’ Fourth Amendment rights. Flythe v. Darby Borough, No. 05-\n5715, 2006 WL 2504023, at *9 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 25, 2006) (citing Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796,\n803 (2d Cir. 1986), Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir. 1986); Mary\nBeth G. v. Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983)).   \n28\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 29 of 49\nauthority provided by numerous circuit courts, this Court draws the following conclusions.\na.  The Invasion of Rights that the Search Entails\nIn Bell, the contact visit strip searches involved visual body cavity inspection. Subsequent\ncases have noted that strip searches, regardless of the particular procedures used,12 constitute\nextremely invasive government action. Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d at 617 (stating that a skin\nsearch invaded plaintiff’s privacy “in a frightening and humiliating manner”); Logan v. Shealy,\n660 F.2d at 1013 (describing a visual strip search as “the ultimate invasion of personal rights”);\nThompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1446 (9th Cir. 1989) (“The feelings of\nhumiliation and degradation associated with forcibly exposing one’s nude body to strangers for\nvisual inspection is beyond dispute.”). Because a more invasive strip search can be “demeaning,\ndehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, [and] repulsive,” it constitutes “one of the most grievous\noffenses against personal dignity and common decency.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 576-77 (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting); accord Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983). \nStrip searches are more intrusive than searches of arrestees incident to arrest. See Mary\nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1268-71; Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1997); Giles v.\nAckerman, 746 F.2d at 616. Strip searches are also considerably more intrusive than “the limited\n12 The term “strip search” generically refers to a variety of searches and search techniques\nwhich vary in scope. See N.G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225, 228 n.4 (2d Cir. 2004) (“‘Strip\nsearch’ is often used as an umbrella term that applies to all inspections of naked individuals.”);\nsee, e.g., Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d at 615-16 (describing a “skin search” which involved the\nremoval of clothes and visual inspection of the naked body); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1267\n(describing a “visual body cavity inspection” similar to the one at issue in Bell); Spear v.\nSowders, 71 F.3d 626, 629 (6th Cir. 1995) (describing a “manual body cavity search,” during\nwhich officers probed the subject’s vagina and anus). Some practices, such as observing a subject\nduring a clothing exchange procedure, instructing a subject to squat and cough while naked, or\ninstructing a subject to insert his or her own fingers into a body cavity, do not fit neatly into one\ncategory or another. In general, however, the precise category of the search is less important than\nthe invasiveness of the techniques employed during the search. Stanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961,\n964 & n.2 (7th Cir. 2003).\n29\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 30 of 49\nsearch of the outer clothing for weapons” authorized by Terry v. Ohio on an officer’s reasonable\nsuspicion, which the Supreme Court described as “a severe, though brief, intrusion upon\ncherished personal security, [which] must surely be an annoying, frightening, and perhaps\nhumiliating experience.” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1968).\nStrip searches differ qualitatively from other intake procedures which entail some\nincidental nudity but do not involve visual inspection of the naked body. Cf Stanley v. Henson,\n337 F.3d 961, 967 (7th Cir. 2003) (upholding a clothing exchange procedure and distinguishing\nthe “relatively narrow intrusion” of the procedure from the more intrusive strip searches\ndescribed in the cases following Bell); Wood v. Hancock County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 354 F.3d 57,\n62-64 (1st Cir. 2003) (defining a strip search as involving “visual inspection” of the naked body\nfor the purpose of determining whether the jail’s clothing exchange and shower procedure\namounted to a strip search). The exposure of the naked body to scrutiny by government officers\nis what makes strip searches more invasive than other admission procedures at a custodial\nfacility.\nThe intrusiveness of the search must also be considered in light of the circumstances and\ncontext of the search. For offenses that are relatively minor, a strip search represents a grossly\ndisproportionate consequence of arrest. Few people would think that their right of privacy in their\nown body, a “cherished value of our society,” Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 772, could be jeopardized\nby the failure to pay parking tickets, shoplifting, or driving without a license. Police officers\narrest and temporarily detain individuals for offenses that carry minimal statutory penalties. See,\ne.g., Stewart, 767 F.2d at 154-55; Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 392-93 (10th Cir. 1984). Under a\nblanket policy, custodial facilities search all of these arrestees without regard to the severity of\n30\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 31 of 49\ntheir offenses or likelihood of conviction.13 For minor offenders unfamiliar with the incidents of\ndetention, strip searches add shock and unexpected humiliation to the already frightening\nexperience of arrest.\nb. The Need for the Particular Search\nIn Bell, the Court identified two reasons why the contact visit strip search policy at issue\nin that case which involved visual body cavity inspection advanced the defendants’ institutional\nsecurity interests. First, the policy enabled prison officers to discover contraband smuggled\nduring contact visits, and second, the blanket policy deterred the smuggling of contraband during\ncontact visits. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. Courts that strike down blanket strip search policies for\ndetained arrestees conclude that the two justifications which supported the constitutionality of the\nMCC policy for contact visit strip searches are lacking in the arrestee context. See Giles v.\nAckerman, 746 F.2d at 617 (“In contrast [to Bell], the County has not demonstrated that its\nsecurity interests warrant the serious invasion of privacy inflicted by its policy.”).\nBecause arrest and detention are generally “unplanned events,” most arrestees have little\nopportunity to plan or carry out smuggling activities. See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d at 617;\naccord Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2001). Moreover, any possession of contraband\n13 This concept of disproportionality is not foreign to Fourth Amendment analysis. “The\nlogic of distinguishing between minor and serious offenses in evaluating the reasonableness of\n. . . searches is almost too clear for argument.” New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 380 (1985)\n(Stevens, J., concurring & dissenting) (discussing the scope of school searches); cf Welsh v.\nWisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 750 (1984) (“[A] finding of exigent circumstances to justify a\nwarantless home entry should be severely restricted when only a minor offense has been\ncommitted . . . .”); McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 459 (1948) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring) (“It is to me a shocking proposition that private homes . . . may be indiscriminately\ninvaded at the discretion of any suspicious police officer engaged in following up offenses that\ninvolve no violence or threats of it.”); but cf. United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 234-35\n(1973) (finding an arrestee’s charges to be irrelevant to the blanket constitutionality of searches\nincident to arrest).\n31\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 32 of 49\nwould, in all likelihood, be discovered during a valid search incident to arrest or a less intrusive\ncustodial search. See Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2001) (“[L]ess\ninvasive (and less constitutionally problematic) searches would have been equally effective in\nrevealing contraband [possessed by detained arrestees].”); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393,\n397 (10th Cir. 1993) (“[J]ails can meet the minimal security concerns they may have with minor\noffenders by means of a less intrusive pat-down search.” (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)). \nFor offenses that are not commonly associated with the possession of weapons, drugs, or\nother contraband, the risk that an arrestee has secreted contraband in such a way that it could only\nbe detected by a strip search shrinks further. Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d at 64 (“Bell authorized\nstrip searches after contact visits, where contraband is often passed. It is far less obvious that\nmisdemeanor arrestees frequently or even occasionally hide contraband in their bodily orifices.”\n(internal citation omitted)); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d at 741. For this reason, conducting\nroutine strip searches on persons who are not arrested for offenses associated with contraband,\nhave never been arrested on any such charges, and who are not carrying any contraband at the\ntime of the arrest bears “no . . . discernible relationship to security needs” of custodial facilities.\nLogan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d at 1013; accord Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273 (“While the need to\nassure jail security is a legitimate and substantial concern, we believe that, [in the absence of\nevidence that the plaintiffs posed a security risk], the strip searches bore an insubstantial\nrelationship to security needs . . . .”). Strip searching arrestees who are unlikely to possess, much\nless conceal, contraband does not serve the institutional security needs of a custodial facility.\nThe second Bell justification—deterrence—figured prominently in the Supreme Court’s\ndetermination that the MCC’s blanket policy was reasonable. The district court struck down the\n32\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 33 of 49\nMCC policy with regard to visual body cavity searches because it concluded that “giving full\nweight to [the deterrence] factor, . . . it cannot justify the more extreme and offensive aspects of\nthe strip search.” United States ex rel. Wolfish v. Levi, 439 F. Supp. 114, 147 (S.D.N.Y. 1977).\nThe circuit court upheld the district court’s decision because “only one instance in the MCC’s\nseveral years of existence when contraband was found during a body cavity inspection.” Wolfish\nv. Levi, 573 F.2d 118, 131 (2d Cir. 1978). The validity of deterrence as a justification for the\nstrip search policy was, therefore, squarely before the Supreme Court. In upholding the MCC\npolicy in its entirety, the Supreme Court relied on the government’s claim that the policy served\nas a deterrent and used that argument to explain the fact that the MCC strip searches after contact\nvisits had uncovered only one incident of attempted smuggling. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.       \nIn the arrestee context, a blanket strip search policy serves little deterrent function. “[T]he\ndeterrent rationale for the Bell [contact visit] search is simply less relevant given the essentially\nunplanned nature of an arrest and subsequent incarceration.” Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111. The\ninmates in Bell planned their contact visits and were aware that under the MCC’s policy they\nwould be strip searched after their contact visits. Arrest and detention, on the other hand,\ngenerally offer little opportunity for the kind of advance planning that might be influenced by\ndeterrent measures. Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d at 617. Further, for those arrestees who have no\nadvance notice of a custodial facility’s strip search policy, the deterrent effect shrinks to zero.\nMary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272 n.8 (“No deterrence effect could have resulted from the strip\nsearch policy . . . because none of the [arrestees] were aware that such a policy even existed.”).\nThese considerations significantly weaken the effectiveness of a blanket arrestee strip search\npolicy and, therefore, a custodial facility’s justification for enforcing it. \n33\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 34 of 49\nc. Reasonableness and Reasonable Suspicion Standard\nBalancing the justifications advanced by custodial facilities against the intrusion on\nprivacy interests inherent in strip searches, the courts cited above concluded that suspicionless\narrestee strip searches, either pursuant to a blanket policy or conducted individually, violate the\nFourth Amendment. In reaching this conclusion, these courts did not underestimate the\nsignificant institutional security concerns of custodial facilities or overstep the deference owed to\nprison officials. Even with those weighty considerations, the courts found that blanket policies\nwhich allow indiscriminate searches of arrestees simply do not satisfy the basic Fourth\nAmendment requirement of reasonableness because they subject too many people to highly\ninvasive, humiliating searches that do not actually promote the institutional security interests of\nthe custodial facility.\nThe individualized standard that courts have imposed after striking down blanket policies\nor suspicionless searches—reasonable suspicion which can be based on “the crime charged, the\nparticular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest”—is a relatively\nlow burden in the Fourth Amendment context. Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d at 802; see Kennedy v.\nLos Angeles Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 702, 714-15 (9th Cir. 1990), overruled on other grounds by\nHunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224 (1991). Because custodial facilities do face serious security risks\nand officials’ efforts to manage such facilities deserve deference, courts have not required that\ncustodial strip searches of detained arrestees be based on probable cause. The standard developed\nin this context thus represents a “‘mutual accommodation between institutional needs and\nobjectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are of general application.’” Bell, 441 U.S.\nat 546 (quoting Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 556 (1974)). \nBecause a search may be justified by an arrestee’s current or prior charges, the reasonable\n34\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 35 of 49\nsuspicion standard developed in this context allows officials to take a more categorical approach\nto custodial strip searches. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112 (“[C]ourts have given prisons latitude to\npremise searches on the type of crime for which an inmate is convicted or arrested.”); see\nDobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 958-58 (6th Cir. 1987) (upholding custodial\nstrip search for person arrested on menacing charge); but see Watt v. Richardson Police Dep’t,\n849 F.2d 195, 198-99 (5th Cir. 1988) (concluding that even a charge-specific strip search policy\ncannot be applied mechanically). And, in reviewing custodial strip searches of detained arrestees\non a case-by-case basis, courts continue to give officials the deference that Bell requires.\nThompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir. 1989) (“[O]n balance, [grand\ntheft auto] is sufficiently associated with violence to justify a visual strip search.”); Wachtler v.\nCounty of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir. 1994) (granting qualified immunity because “we\ncannot say on the somewhat unique facts before us[—arrest based on plaintiff’s failure to\nproduce ID when stopped for speeding—]that it is clearly established that no ‘reasonable\nsuspicion’ justified a strip-search in this case”). \nDefendant does not argue that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under this precedent.\nInstead, defendant argues that the Court should follow Powell and disregard the foregoing\nauthority in its entirety. On this front, defendant’s arguments fail. \n3. Powell v. Barrett and Defendant’s Powell-Based Arguments      \nPowell began as a putative class action by eleven former inmates of the Fulton County\nJail in Georgia (“FCJ”), all of whom were strip searched pursuant to the FCJ’s blanket policy of\nstrip searching inmates entering or reentering the general prison population. Powell v. Barrett,\n35\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 36 of 49\n541 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc).14 The proposed class was divided into three\ngroups, only one of which was before the en banc court. This group consisted of recent arrestees\nwho were strip searched upon admission to the FCJ and before placement in the FCJ’s general\npopulation.15 Id. At the motion to dismiss stage, the district court ruled that defendants were\nentitled to qualified immunity. Powell v. Barrett, 376 F. Supp. 2d 1340, 1350 (N.D. Ga. 2005).\nAssuming that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged a Fourth Amendment cause of action, the\ndistrict court nevertheless found that the unconstitutionality of the blanket strip search policy was\nnot clearly established. Id. at 1346 n.3, 1349-50. Noting that “defendants’ motions [to dismiss]\ninvolve[d] several controlling questions of law with respect to which there is substantial ground\nfor difference of opinion,” the district court certified the issues raised in defendants’ motions for\nimmediate interlocutory appeal. Order, Powell v. Barrett, No. 04-cv-1100 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 15,\n2005). \nOn interlocutory appeal, the Eleventh Circuit panel reversed the district court’s qualified\nimmunity ruling. Following the binding precedent of earlier Eleventh Circuit opinions, the panel\nconcluded both that “the Jail’s alleged policy of conducting blanket strip searches on all arrestees\nat booking, on the single ground that they are to be placed in the Jail’s general population, must\nbe deemed unconstitutional” and that the unconstitutionality of the policy was clearly\n14 Citations to “Powell” in this Part of the Memorandum, as in other Parts, refer to the\nEleventh Circuit’s en banc opinion, and not to the lower court opinion or the Eleventh Circuit’s\npanel opinion. \n15 The other two groups included detainees who were strip searched before being released\nfrom the FCJ, either after initial bail hearings or after court appearances. After ruling on the\nconstitutionality of the point-of-entry strip searches conducted on arrestees being placed in the\ngeneral population, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case to the panel to apply the principles\ndiscussed in the en banc opinion to the other two groups. Powell, 541 F.3d at 1314. The panel\nremanded the case to the district court for further factual development. Powell v. Barrett, No. 05-\n16734, 2009 WL 117586, at *2 (11th Cir. Jan. 20, 2009).\n36\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 37 of 49\nestablished. Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1310-13, 1315-17 (11th Cir. 2007). Before so\nruling, however, the panel pointed out “that a majority of our Court has expressed uncertainty\nabout our precedent holding that strip searches of arrestees to be placed in the jail’s general\npopulation, absent reasonable suspicion, violate the Fourth Amendment.” Id. at 1312 (citing\nEvans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272, 1278 (11th Cir. 2005) (en banc)). Sua sponte, the Eleventh\nCircuit granted rehearing en banc to resolve this uncertainty. Order, Powell v. Barrett, No. 05-\n16734 (11th Cir. Feb. 1, 2008). \nSitting en banc, the Eleventh Circuit overruled its own precedent with regard to the\nconstitutionality of blanket arrestee strip search policies and affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs’\nclaims. Powell, 541 F.3d at 1306-07, 1314. The Powell opinion now stands alone for the holding\nthat arrestees’ Fourth Amendment rights “are not violated by a policy or practice of strip\nsearching each one of them as part of the booking process, provided that the searches are no more\nintrusive on privacy interests than those upheld in the Bell case.” Id. at 1314. In reaching this\nholding, the Eleventh Circuit departed from the twenty-five years of contrary circuit precedent\ndiscussed in Part IV.C.2 of this Memorandum.\nThe Eleventh Circuit forcefully criticizes that precedent as “thinly disguised defiance” of\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Bell. Powell, 541 F.3d 1312. Focusing on two main issues—(1)\nthe validity of the reasonable suspicion standard in the custodial strip search context and (2) the\nappropriateness of differentiating between minor offenders and serious offenders in the arrestee\ncontext—Powell refutes the line that other circuits have drawn between contact visit strip\nsearches and arrestee strip searches in custodial facilities. Contrary to those courts’ rulings,\nPowell holds that “the security needs that the Court in Bell found to justify strip searching an\ninmate re-entering the jail population after a contact visit are no greater than those that justify\n37\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 38 of 49\nsearching an arrestee when he is being booked into the general population for the first time.” Id.\nat 1302. For the reasons that follow, this Court disagrees with both the reasoning and holding of\nthe Eleventh Circuit in Powell.   \na. The Source of the Reasonable Suspicion Standard Identified\nby Powell\nThe Eleventh Circuit summarized circuit precedent on the constitutionality of arrestee\nstrip searches by stating “[w]e are aware that some courts have interpreted the Bell decision as\nrequiring, or at least permitting lower courts to require, reasonable suspicion as a condition for\ndetention facility searches, especially those that involve visual body cavity inspections. . . . Those\ndecisions misread Bell as requiring reasonable suspicion.” Powell, 541 F.3d at 1306-07 (internal\ncitations omitted). This Court disagrees with the Eleventh Circuit’s premise and conclusion.\nPowell attributes the reasonable suspicion standard to the following sentence in Bell: “We\ndeal here with the question whether visual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by the MCC\nrules can ever be conducted on less than probable cause.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 560 (emphasis in\noriginal); Powell, 541 F.3d at 1309. The Eleventh Circuit assumes that this sentence is the source\nof the circuit court holdings requiring reasonable suspicion and then states that “neither the\nquestion nor the answer compels the conclusion that ‘less than probable cause’ means\n‘reasonable suspicion.’” Powell, 541 F.3d at 1309. This Court agrees with Powell’s interpretation\nof that sentence in Bell but disagrees with Powell’s reading of the cases requiring reasonable\nsuspicion. Those courts, even the courts cited in Powell, did not rely on the untenable premise\nthat, by holding that the contact visit strip searches could be conducted on less than probable\ncause, Bell affirmatively required reasonable suspicion. See, e.g., Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1,\n6 (1st Cir. 1997); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 800 (2d Cir. 1986); Mary Beth G. v. City of\n38\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 39 of 49\nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1984).16 \nCircuits other than the Eleventh Circuit relied on the Fourth Amendment’s\nreasonableness requirement and the balancing test articulated in Bell to strike down suspicionless\ncustodial strip searches of detained arrestees. Applying that test, circuit courts have ruled that\npolicies requiring strip searches for all arrestees, regardless of the charges or circumstances, are\nunreasonable and therefore unconstitutional. See Part IV.C.2 supra. In the wake of such rulings,\ncourts had to determine under what circumstances officials would be constitutionally permitted\nto search a detained arrestee in accordance with the Fourth Amendment. The reasonable\nsuspicion standard resulted from that inquiry and not because it was required by Bell. See, e.g.,\nMary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273; see also Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 702,\n714-15 (9th Cir. 1990), overruled on other grounds by Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224 (1991)\n(describing the provenance of the reasonable suspicion standard in the arrestee strip search\ncontext).\nIn contesting the premise that Bell requires custodial strip searches to be predicated on\nreasonable suspicion, Powell focuses on three features of the Bell opinion. First, Bell, in\napproving a blanket policy, upheld suspicionless strip searches and rejected a case-by-case\napproach to the reasonableness inquiry.17 Second, the Eleventh Circuit points to Justice Powell’s\n16 The only cases which state that Bell, itself, “requires” an objective standard, such as\nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion, are the Eleventh Circuit decisions which preceded\nPowell. Justice v. City of Peachtree, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (11th Cir. 1992) (“The Bell balancing test\nfor reasonableness requires at ‘a minimum, that the facts upon which the intrusion is based be\ncapable of measurement against an objective standard, whether this be probable cause or a less\nstringent test.’”(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Wilson v. Jones, 251\nF.3d 1340, 1342-43 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Justice); Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678, 682\n(11th Cir. 2000) (reiterating, without quoting, the same statement in Justice).\n17 At least one court questions this conclusion. “[J]ust because the searches in Bell were\nconducted pursuant to a blanket policy does not mean that reasonable suspicion was lacking. . . .\n39\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 40 of 49\ndissenting opinion in Bell which reads, in its entirety:\nI join the opinion of the Court except the discussion and holding with respect to\nbody-cavity searches. In view of the serious intrusion on one’s privacy occasioned\nby such a search, I think at least some level of cause, such as a reasonable\nsuspicion, should be required to justify the anal and genital searches described in\nthis case. I therefore dissent on this issue.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 563 (Powell, J., dissenting); Powell, 541 F.3d at 1308. Although the Eleventh\nCircuit acknowledges the risks inherent in using dissenting opinions to interpret majority\nholdings, Powell, 541 F.3d at 1308, the court nevertheless relies on Justice Powell’s statement as\nconvincing evidence that the majority opinion approved suspicionless strip searches. Id. Finally,\nthe Eleventh Circuit unveils what it considers to be “one momentous fact of Franciscan\nsimplicity”: the Bureau of Prisons continues to enforce a blanket policy of strip searching all\ninmates after contact visits, a policy that has not been challenged since Bell. Id.  \nAt most, these three considerations prove that the Supreme Court, on the facts before it,\napproved a blanket policy requiring strip searches for all inmates following contact visits as\nreasonable and did not require searches conducted pursuant to that policy to be based on\nindividualized reasonable suspicion. The Court did not have occasion to rule on the\nreasonableness of custodial strip searches in other circumstances or under what circumstances\nreasonable suspicion might be required. See Powell, 541 F.3d at 1316 (Barkett, J., dissenting)\n(pointing out that “Bell did not validate strip searches in detention settings per se”). The Bell\nCourt did hold that, assuming the Fourth Amendment applies, the Fourth Amendment requires\nall strip searches or strip search policies in custodial settings to be reasonable. Bell, 441 U.S. at\n[Contact] visits, by their very nature, may . . . provide the requisite reasonable suspicion for jail\nofficers to justify the blanket search policy.” Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of\nBurlington, No. 05-3619, 2009 WL 252174, at *13 (D.N.J. Feb. 4, 2009); accord Powell, 541\nF.3d at 1316-17 (Barkett, J., dissenting).\n40\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 41 of 49\n558-59.\nThis is one of many situations where linguistic precision matters a great deal. Other\ncourts did not hold that Bell “requires” reasonable suspicion; they held that Bell requires\nreasonableness and that reasonableness, in certain circumstances, requires that searches be based\non individualized suspicion of wrongdoing measured against some objective standard such as\nreasonable suspicion. For this reason, this Court concludes that the Powell opinion does not, in\nfact, demonstrate that other circuit opinions were wrongly decided or that they misapplied Bell.\nb.  Powell’s Rejection of the Misdemeanor-Felony Distinction and\nthe Distinction between Contact Visit Strip Searches and\nArrestee Strip Searches\nAlthough the Eleventh Circuit describes the misdemeanor-felony distinction as simply\n“[o]ne other point . . . worth discussing,” it is one of the reasons for the Eleventh Circuit’s\nrejection of circuit precedent and subsequent conclusion that blanket policies are equally justified\nfor contact visit strip searches and arrestee strip searches. Powell, 541 F.3d 1309-14. For this\nreason, the Court combines its discussion of these issues.\nPowell states that “[t]he difference between felonies and misdemeanors or other lesser\noffenses is without constitutional significance when it comes to detention facility strip searches”\nbecause it “finds no basis in the Bell decision, in the reasoning of that decision, or in the real\nworld of detention facilities.” Powell, 541 F.3d at 1310. The Eleventh Circuit is correct that the\nBell Court did not discuss the distinction between misdemeanors and felonies or, for that matter,\nthe distinction between minor offenders and serious offenders, in relation to the reasonableness\nof the MCC’s contact visit strip search policy.18 The fact that these distinctions were not\n18 To demonstrate that the Supreme Court had occasion to consider this issue, the\nEleventh Circuit points out that the MCC housed “detainees facing only lesser charges, people\nincarcerated for contempt of court, and witnesses in protective custody.” Powell, 541 F.3d at\n41\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 42 of 49\ndiscussed in the contact visit context does not mean, however, that they are never relevant to\nFourth Amendment reasonableness balancing.\nThe distinction between felonies and misdemeanors is relevant in the arrest context\nbecause it serves as a rough proxy for whether or not an arrestee will be detained pending trial.\nFor persons arrested on misdemeanors or other minor offenses, detention is usually temporary.\nThe strip searches at issue in this case and in the cases discussed in this Memorandum generally\noccurred during the intermediary period after arrest and before arraignment, before a bench\nwarrant hearing, or before the posting of bail. For serious offenders who will be detained pending\ntrial and subject to the regular and constitutional incidents of detention, such as contact visit strip\nsearches, an intake strip search represents one of several strip searches to which such pretrial\ndetainees will be subjected. The same cannot be said for minor offenders who will not be\ndetained pending trial. Further, the distinction between minor offenders and serious offenders,\nwhich tracks the misdemeanor-felony distinction, impacts the balance between the need for the\nsearch and the invasion of rights that the search entails, as discussed in Part IV.C.2.\nPowell states that plaintiffs’ “best hope for distinguishing Bell lies in the fact that they\nwere strip searched as part of the booking process instead of after contact visits.” Powell, 541\nF.3d at 1313. The Eleventh Circuit denies the validity of this distinction because “an inmate’s\ninitial entry into a detention facility might be viewed as coming after one big and prolonged\ncontact visit with the outside world.” Id. Defendant agrees and further argues that “[i]ncoming\n1310. However, of these three categories of inmates, only the pretrial detainees were before the\nSupreme Court. Bell, 441 U.S. at 523-24, 528-30. Further, the Supreme Court did not mention\nwhat charges the MCC’s pretrial detainees faced. It did, however, note that “[u]nder the Bail\nReform Act, a person in the federal system is committed to a detention facility only because no\nother less drastic means can reasonably ensure his presence at trial.” Id. at 524 (internal citation\nomitted). \n42\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 43 of 49\ninmates have not been under any supervision whatsoever, and obviously present[] a greater\nsecurity hazard than someone who has just come from an observed visit within the institution.”\n(Def. Mot. at 12.)  This Court is not persuaded by these attempts to place arrestee strip searches\nunder the umbrella of the Bell holding with regard to contact visits. Although recent arrestees\nmight have more opportunity to possess contraband than inmates, opportunity alone does not\nchange the likelihood that a person arrested on non-violent, non-drug offenses actually possesses\ncontraband. It also does not increase the chance that the contraband will be secreted in such a\nway that it will not be discovered by less invasive searches. \nSimilarly, in ruling on the pending motion, the Court is not influenced by the fact that\nsome persons do anticipate their own arrests and might have the opportunity to conceal\ncontraband. See Powell, 541 F.3d at 1313 (“Some people surrender when they are notified that a\nwarrant for them is outstanding. . . . [Others] deliberately get themselves arrested.”) Such\ncircumstances do not justify an otherwise unreasonable blanket policy. See Newkirk v. Sheers,\n834 F. Supp. 772, 789-90 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (rejecting defendants’ argument that the strip searches\nof non-violent protestors pursuant to a blanket policy was reasonable because persons “‘who\ncommit actions intending or expecting to go to prison’” threaten institutional security). In cases\nwhere arrestees self surrender or deliberately subject themselves to arrest, officials may well have\nreasonable suspicion to conduct an intake strip search. Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir.\n2001).\nThis Court disagrees with Powell’s conclusion that the holding in Bell invalidates the\nanalysis of other courts with respect to the reasonableness of blanket strip search policies in the\narrestee context. Reasonableness is a flexible standard which allows for consideration of\ndifferent factors in different contexts. In the arrestee context, a person’s charges and the\n43\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 44 of 49\ncircumstances of his arrest are relevant for the determination of whether a blanket intake strip\nsearch policy is reasonable. The fact that Bell did not discuss those factors in the contact visit\ncontext, where they were less relevant, is of no moment.          \nc.  Fourth Amendment Analysis Absent a Factual Record\nThe Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the Powell plaintiffs’ complaint because\n“the security needs that the Court in Bell found to justify strip searching an inmate re-entering the\njail population after a contact visit are no greater than those that justify searching an arrestee\nwhen he is being booked into the general population for the first time.” Powell, 541 F.3d at 1302.\nDefendant strongly supports this conclusion, arguing that Bell bars plaintiffs’ claims because\nGEO’s need for the search policy is “no different” from the need for the policy in Bell. (Def.\nReply at 5-6, 8.) This Court disagrees with this position two reasons. First, it oversimplifies the\n“need for the particular search” prong of Bell. Second, it ignores the fact-intensive nature of\nFourth Amendment inquiry. \nMaintaining institutional security within custodial facilities obviously qualifies as a\nlegitimate governmental interest. Bell recognized that “[a] detention facility is a unique place\nfraught with serious security dangers.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. Hudson described “the paramount\ninterest in institutional security” as “‘central to all other corrections goals.’” Hudson v. Palmer,\n468 U.S. 517, 527 (1984) (quoting Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823 (1974)). The Supreme\nCourt’s decision to uphold the strip search policy at issue in Bell was strongly influenced by such\nconsiderations. Bell, 441 U.S. at 560; Powell, 541 F.3d at 1306 (describing the weight the\nSupreme Court placed on the security interests of the institution). Nevertheless, the invocation of\n“institutional security concerns” does not give defendant carte blanche to implement\nconstitutionally suspect policies. See Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 593 (1984) (Blackmun,\n44\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 45 of 49\nJ., concurring) (“The fact that particular measures advance prison security . . . does not make\nthem ipso facto constitutional.”) Sufficient justification only exists when the search policy is\nreasonably calculated to achieve the government’s stated goals.\nAs summarized above in Part IV.C.2.b, courts have consistently concluded that the\ninterests which justified the implementation of a blanket policy in the contact visit context in\nBell—discovery and deterrence—did not justify the implementation of a blanket policy in the\narrestee context. Powell does not address this reasoning. Instead, Powell relies on generalizations\nand the factual findings in other cases to demonstrate that arrestee strip searches might be\nwarranted under certain circumstances. Powell, 541 F.3d at 1310-11, 1313-14. The hypothetical\nexistence of reasonable arrestee strip searches does not, however, automatically justify an\noverinclusive blanket policy. Further, the fact that a blanket policy might be reasonable in one\nfacility does not mean that a blanket policy will be reasonable in all facilities. Where, as with\nstrip searches, the government action intrudes on an individual’s constitutionally protected right\nto bodily privacy, the search policy must be based on the actual, not hypothetical, needs of the\ninstitution. Defendant’s claim that institutional security concerns justify all search policies in\ncustodial facilities will not suffice. \nThe Eleventh Circuit’s decision to uphold a blanket strip search policy on appeal from a\nmotion to dismiss does not take into consideration the fact-intensive nature of Fourth\nAmendment analysis generally and under Bell. Powell, 541 F.3d at 1302. In Bell, the Supreme\nCourt observed that “[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of\nprecise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for\nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.” Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559 (emphasis added). “Absent precedent that is clearly controlling, it is incumbent on\n45\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 46 of 49\n[courts] to examine independently [the facts of the challenged searches] in light of the\nrequirement of the [F]ourth [A]mendment that they not be ‘unreasonable.’” Mary Beth G. v. City\nof Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1271 (7th Cir. 1983). The courts of appeals that have assessed the\nconstitutionality of custodial strip searches have all evaluated the reasonableness of those\nsearches in light of the facts of each case and by reference to the Fourth Amendment standard\nlaid out in Bell. This Court is aware of no circuit court other than the Eleventh Circuit in Powell\nwhich has upheld the constitutionality of an arrestee strip search without a factual record. Accord\nPowell, 541 F.3d at 1316 (Barkett, J., dissenting).\nBecause this Court concludes that the Supreme Court ruling in Bell with regard to contact\nvisit strip searches does not control the constitutionality of custodial strip search policies\ninvolving detained arrestees, such as the one alleged by plaintiffs, the Court must independently\nrule on the reasonableness of such a policy. Without a factual record, however, this Court is\nunable to balance “the need for the particular search [policy] against the invasion of personal\nrights that the search [policy] entails” as Bell requires. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. At this stage in the\nlitigation, the Court can only evaluate whether the allegations in plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint\nstate claims upon which relief can be granted. \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment Claims\nHaving found Powell’s criticisms of circuit precedent unpersuasive, this Court will\ncontinue to follow the authority of other circuits, as described in Part IV.C.2 of this\nMemorandum. That authority holds that suspicionless strip searches of detained arrestees upon\nadmission to a custodial facility violate the Fourth Amendment and requires that custodial strip\nsearches of detained arrestees be based on reasonable suspicion that the arrestee has concealed\nweapons or contraband. In this case, plaintiffs allege that defendant has a policy or practice of\n46\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 47 of 49\nstrip searching all arrestees without any individualized suspicion that those arrestees have\nsecreted contraband. The named plaintiffs further allege that they were strip searched upon\nadmission to defendant’s Hill Facility and that their strip searches were not based on reasonable\nsuspicion.\nThe strip searches described in plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint involved the visual\ninspection of the named plaintiffs’ naked bodies. Plaintiff Allison was required to squat and\ncough while naked. Plaintiff Hocevar was required to remove his clothes in the presence of other\ndetainees. While not as invasive as the strip searches in Bell, which involved visual body cavity\ninspection, plaintiffs’ searches were similar to, or more invasive than, the strip searches that have\nbeen scrutinized and struck down by other courts. Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253, 1255\n(6th Cir. 1989) (skin search in the presence of other people); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 393,\n394-95 (10th Cir. 1984) (same); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 615, 617-18 (9th Cir. 1984)\n(per curiam), overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th\nCir. 1999) (skin search). \nAlso, at least two cases suggest that the named plaintiffs’ charges, DUI and domestic\ndispute charges, do not give rise to reasonable suspicion for the purposes of conducting a\ncustodial strip search on an arrestee. Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981)\n(“[DUI], though not a minor traffic offense, [is] nevertheless [an offense] not commonly\nassociated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband.”); Shain v. Ellison,\n273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding that the custodial strip search of plaintiff, who had been\narrested for first degree harassment arising from a domestic dispute, was unconstitutional). \nMore importantly, however, all courts confronted with the issue have ruled that blanket\narrestee strip search policies, such as the one alleged by plaintiffs, are unreasonable and therefore\n47\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 48 of 49\nunconstitutional. See, e.g., Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 803 (2d Cir. 1986); Stewart v. Lubbock\nCounty, 767 F.2d 153, 156-157 (5th Cir. 1985); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263,\n1273 (7th Cir. 1983). Under these cases and the other authority cited in this Memorandum,\nplaintiffs have pled viable Fourth Amendment claims.  \nVI. CONCLUSION\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Motion of Defendant The GEO\nGroup, Inc. for Judgment on the Pleadings. Plaintiffs’ claims for relief will be judged against the\nFourth Amendment standards summarized in this Memorandum and not the Eleventh Circuit\ndecision in Powell. This ruling is without prejudice to defendant’s right to argue the\nconstitutionality of its actions at the summary judgment stage and/or at trial. \nAn appropriate Order follows.\n48\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 41    Filed 03/25/09   Page 49 of 49\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nPENNY ALLISON and ZORAN HOCEVAR, : CIVIL ACTION\nindividually and on behalf of a class of others :\nsimilarly situated, :\n          Plaintiffs,        :\n       : NO. 08-467\nv.        :\n       :\nTHE GEO GROUP, INC., in its official and : \nindividual capacities, and JOHN DOES    :\n1 – 100, in their official and individual :\ncapacities, :\nDefendants.        :\nO R D E R\nAND NOW, this 24th day of March, 2009, upon consideration of the Motion of Defendant\nThe GEO Group, Inc. for Judgment on the Pleadings (Document No. 29, filed September 18, 2008),\nPlaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant The GEO Group, Inc.’s Motion for\nJudgment on the Pleadings (Document No. 35, filed October 21, 2008), the Reply Memorandum of\nLaw in Support of the Motion of Defendant The GEO Group, Inc. for Judgment on the Pleadings\n(Document No. 37, filed November 5, 2008), and the related submissions of the parties, for the\nreasons set forth in the attached Memorandum, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion of Defendant\nThe GEO Group, Inc. for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant’s request for oral argument is DENIED AS\nMOOT.   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the partial stay on discovery imposed by Order dated\nOctober 10, 2008 is VACATED.

This is a class action brought against Defendants The GEO Group, Inc. \n(“GEO”) and John Doe Defendants 1 — 100 (collectively with GEO, “Defendants”) in \ntheir individual capacities and in their official capacities as administrators, \nmanagers, and/or operators of the “Facilities,” as that phrase is defined herein. \nDefendant GEO has been hired by various governmental entities across the country \nto manage, oversee, and operate their prisons, jails, correctional facilities, \nresidential, detention, treatment, and medical facilities. This action seeks to redress \nand prevent the deprivation of rights secured to Plaintiffs Penny Allison and Zoran \nHocevar (collectively, “Plaintiffs’) and the proposed Class under the United States \nConstitution, the laws of the United States and of various states. The Defendants, \nwhile serving as government actors, have employed a uniform practice and \n1 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 2 of 27\nprocedure of strip searching all pre-trial detainees who enter the Facilities, \nregardless of the crime or violation for which they are detained, and without \nmaking the legally required determination of whether reasonable suspicion exists to \njustify a strip search (the “Illegal Strip Search Practice or Policy”). Upon \ninformation and belief, this uniform practice and procedure is, in part, derived from \nthe written policies and procedures of the Defendants, and is implemented, \nemployed and/or overseen by Defendants at numerous jails across the United \nStates.  \n  2.  Individuals charged with non-violent, non-weapon, and non-drug \nrelated offenses cannot be lawfully strip searched upon entry or transfer to jail \nabsent particularized suspicion that those detainees possess or are concealing \nweapons, drugs or other contraband. Thus, a blanket policy of conducting strip \nsearches on all arrestees, including pre-trial detainees, on the ground that they are \nto be placed into the jail’s general population is a violation of the detainee’s \nconstitutional rights.  \n  3.  The Illegal Strip Search Practice or Policy implemented, overseen, \nand/or employed by Defendants compels and/or compelled all new inmates, \nincluding pre-trial detainees, regardless of the charges or circumstances, to undergo \nthe indignities, humiliation and embarrassment of a strip search upon admission to \nthe Facilities.  \n  4.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and a Class of \nthousands of others who were unconstitutionally strip searched pursuant to \n2 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 3 of 27\nDefendants’ Illegal Strip Search Practice of Policy in various Facilities across the \nUnited States to vindicate their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments and under state law.  \n  5.  GEO is a government actor and operates under color of state law in \ncarrying out the function of operating a jail under contracts with various counties. \nThe operation of jails is traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the government. \nWhen private organizations, such as Defendant GEO, contract to perform such \ngovernmental functions, those entities and its agents are liable for violations of \nfederal and state created rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the United States \nConstitution, and under state tort law. For the purposes of this action, Defendant \nGEO stands in the shoes of the counties on whose behalf it has been hired to \noperate, manage, and oversee the Facilities.  \nJURISDICTION \n  6.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331, 1341 and 1343 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs seek to obtain \ncompensatory damages, punitive damages, and declaratory relief for the \ndeprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States \nsecured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and 1983. \nThis Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § \n2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the \npolicies of local government entities.  \n3 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 4 of 27\n  7.  Jurisdiction is also conferred upon this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1332(d)(2) because: (i) there are 100 or more class members, (ii) there is an \naggregate amount in controversy of at least $5,000,000, exclusive of interest and \ncosts, and (iii) there is minimal diversity because at least one plaintiff and one \ndefendant are citizens of different states. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction \nover the state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  \n  8.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving \nrise to Plaintiffs’ claims and those of many of the proposed Class members occurred \nin substantial part in this judicial district. Defendant GEO operates at least one \nJail facility that employs the Illegal Strip Search Practice or Policy that is located \nwithin the geographic region covered by this Court.  \nDEFINITIONS \n  9.  As used herein, the phrase “Facilities” shall refer to any and all jail(s), \nprison(s), correctional, detention facility, residential, detention, treatment, and/or \nmedical facilities: (i) where arrestees and/or pre-trial detainees are held, (ii) which \nDefendant GEO manages, administers, runs, and/or oversees, and (iii) that employs \nthe Illegal Strip Search Practice of Policy. The phrase “Facilities” is limited to \njail(s), prison(s), correctional, detention facility, residential, detention, treatment, \nand/or medical facilities that Defendant GEO manages, administers, and/or \noversees – in whole or in part – on behalf of any local government, municipality, or \ncounty in the United States.  \n4 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 5 of 27\n  10.  The “Illegal Strip Search Practice or Policy” refers to the Defendants’ \nwritten, unwritten, and/or de facto policy or practice of strip searching all \nindividuals detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses, violations of probation \nor parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments and/or other similar non-violent, \nnon-drug, and non-weapons related possession offenses upon their commitment to \none or more of the Facilities.  \n11.  For purposes of this Amended Complaint, strip and visual cavity \nsearches are collectively referred to as “Strip Searches.”  \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff Allison is an adult female who lives at 412 West Jefferson \nStreet in Media, Pennsylvania.  After being placed into the custody of Defendants, \nand as described in more detail infra, Allison was subjected to an unconstitutional \nstrip search at one of the Facilities. \n13.  Plaintiff Hocevar is an adult male who resides in Upper Darby, \nPennsylvania.  Hocevar was arrested in or around March of 2005, and was detained \nat one of Defendant’s Facilities in or around August 2007.  After being placed into \nthe custody of Defendants, and as described in more detail infra, Hocevar was \nsubjected to an unconstitutional strip search at one of the Facilities. \n14.  Defendant GEO is a Florida corporation whose common stock is \npublicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:GEO). According to its \nmost recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), \nGEO recorded revenues in excess of $860 million in 2006. As of December 31, 2006, \n5 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 6 of 27\nDefendant GEO had over 10,000 full-time employees. GEO can be served at its \nheadquarters at One Park Place, Suite 700, 621 Northwest 53 Street in Boca Raton, \nFlorida. GEO has previously operated under the name “Wackenhut Corrections \nCorp.”  \n15.  In its SEC filings, Defendant GEO describes itself as “a leading \nprovider of government-outsourced services specializing in the management of \ncorrectional, detention and mental health and residential treatment facilities in the \nUnited States, Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Canada. We \noperate a broad range of correctional and detention facilities including maximum, \nmedium and minimum security prisons, immigration detention centers, minimum \nsecurity detention centers and mental health and residential treatment facilities. \nOur correctional and detention management services involve the provision of \nsecurity, administrative, rehabilitation, education, health and food services, \nprimarily at adult male correctional and detention facilities.”  \n16.  As of December 31, 2006, Defendant GEO operated a total of sixty-two \n(62) correctional, detention, and mental health residential treatment facilities. \nUpon information and belief, GEO operates and/or manages jails, prisons, and \ncorrectional facilities in sixteen (16) different states. \n17.  Various other individual persons (including without limitation, law \nenforcement and corrections officers), the identities of whom are presently unknown \nto Plaintiff and his counsel, have participated as co-conspirators with GEO and \nother actors in the violations alleged herein, and have performed acts in furtherance \n6 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 7 of 27\nthereof. Collectively, these defendants shall be referred to herein as the “John Doe \nDefendants,” and they include, without limitation, the various local government, \nmunicipal, and county entities with which Defendant GEO contracted regarding the \nmaintenance and management of their prisons. The acts charged in this Complaint \nhave been done by Defendants and their co-conspirators, and/or were authorized, \nordered or done by their respective officers, agents, employees or representatives.  \n18.  At all times relevant hereto, Defendant GEO has acted as the agent of \nthe respective local government, municipal, and county entities with which GEO \ncontracted to manage/oversee the Facilities.  \n19.  This Amended Complaint seeks monetary damages and other relief \nfrom the Defendants in their respective individual, official, and personal capacities.  \nFACTS \nFACTS APPLICABLE TO THE CLASS GENERALLY \n20.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made \napplicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits local government \nand county officials, including the Defendants in this action, from performing strip \nsearches of arrestees who have been detained for non-violent, non-drug and non-\nweapons possession offenses unless the corrections officer has reasonable suspicion \nto believe that the detainee is concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband.  \n21.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from \nthe particular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the \nviolation or crime charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the \ncircumstances of the arrest.  \n7 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 8 of 27\n22.  Upon information and belief, the Defendants have promulgated, \nimplemented, enforced, carried out, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto \npolicy, practice or custom of uniformly strip searching all individuals placed into the \ncustody of the Facilities without any demonstration or finding of reasonable \nsuspicion. This written and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of arrestees \nand pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the \ncharacteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were \nrelevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip \nsearches.  \n23.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the \nClass, including the named Plaintiffs, was the victim of a routine strip search upon \ntheir transfer and/or entry into one or more of the Facilities. These strip searches \nwere conducted without any inquiry into or establishment of reasonable suspicion, \nand in fact were not supported by any suspicion at all. Strip searches are conducted \nfor offenses which are non-violent and non-drug related in nature, and, taken alone, \ndo not objectively give rise to a particularized reasonable suspicion that the \ndetainee is concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband.  \n24.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches \nconducted pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the \nunlawful strip searches have suffered and in the future will suffer psychological \npain, humiliation, and mental anguish.  \n \n8 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 9 of 27\nFACTS APPLICABLE TO THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nAND TO DEFENDANT GEO’S HILL FACILITY \n \nA.  NAMED PLAINTIFF ALLISON. \n25.  In or around November of 2005, Plaintiff Allison was arrested for DUI, \nand was ultimately placed on the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program \n(“ARD”).  As a condition of her ARD, Allison was required to pay fines and court \ncosts.  In or around July of 2006, Allison paid a fine at the courthouse, but \ninadvertently failed to appear for a court hearing to finalize her ARD.   \n26.  On July 25, 2006, Allison was stopped by the Springfield Township \nPolice for having an expired registration.  The police ran her name through the \nsystem and determined that Allison had an outstanding bench warrant for her \nfailure to appear at the court hearing in connection with her ARD proceedings.  \nAllison was arrested, transferred to the Springfield Police Department, and was \nsubsequently transferred to the George W. Hill Correctional Facility (the “Hill \nFacility”) located at 500 Cheyney Road in Thornton, Pennsylvania. \n27.  Upon arrival at the Hill Facility, Allison was placed in a holding cell \nfor a few hours, and was then placed in a booking room.  Allison then spent \napproximately 30 minutes answering questions, and was subsequently escorted to \nanother room by a female corrections officer.  The female corrections officer \ninstructed Allison to remove all of her clothes, squat and cough.  The female \ncorrection officer looked at Allison’s bra and remarked that it was a “nice bra.”  \nWhen Ms. Allison was ultimately released from the Hill Facility eight days later her \nbra was not returned.   \n9 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 10 of 27\n  28.  When she later appeared in court, Allison’s attorney explained the \nmisunderstanding, and Allison was released from the Hill Facility.  Due to a clerical \nerror at the prison, however, Allison was not released from the Hill Facility until \nthe following day.  \n29.  In or around December of 2007 Allison was arrested for and plead \nguilty to a second DUI.  As part of her sentence, Allison has been and continues to \ngo to the Delaware County Prison for a total of 15 weekends.  Allison has been strip \nsearched every time that she enters the Hill Facility.  During these strip searches, \nthe corrections officer brings all of the weekend females into a classroom size room \nand strip searches them one by one in front of all the other females.   \n30.  On one occasion while Allison was being strip searched, a male \ncorrections officer entered the room.   \n31.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-searches \nconducted pursuant to Defendants’ policy, practice and custom, Plaintiff Allison has \nsuffered injuries.  \nB.  NAMED PLAINTIFF ZORAN HOCEVAR. \n32.    Plaintiff Hocevar was arrested in or around March of 2005 for charges \nstemming from a domestic dispute involving his wife.  In August of 2007, all of \nthese charges – with the exception of harassment – were dismissed.  \n33.  Plaintiff Hocevar mistakenly believed that these charges had been \nresolved, and inadvertently failed to appear at a scheduled court date.  A bench \nwarrant was issued for his arrest in or around June of 2006.  \n10 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 11 of 27\n34.  In July 2007, Hocevar was stopped in his car in Montgomery County.  \nAfter police discovered the outstanding warrant, Hocevar was taken to the Hill \nFacility.  Upon entry to the Hill Facility, Hocevar was subject to a strip search in a \nroom with a number of other individuals.   \n35.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-searches \nconducted pursuant to Defendants’ policy, practice and custom, Hocevar has \nsuffered injuries.  \nC.  THE HILL FACILITY. \n36.  The Hill Facility is managed by Defendant GEO pursuant to a contract \nwith Delaware County. Upon information and belief, Defendant GEO has operated \nthe Hill Facility since 1995. In November of 2007, it was reported that Delaware \nCounty and Defendant GEO agreed to a contract extension that calls for Defendant \nGEO to continue to operate the Hill Facility through 2009 under for $80 million. \nAccording to an article published in the November 28, 2007 edition of the \nPhiladelphia Daily News, the annual cost of outsourcing the Hill Facility is the \nsingle largest expenditure of Delaware County tax dollars. Indeed, it has been \nreported that the County pays in excess of $3 million per month to Defendant GEO \nin exchange for operating the Hill Facility.  \n37.  According to Delaware County’s website, the Hill Facility is \n“responsible for the incarceration of pretrial detainees and persons serving a county \nsentence of two years less one day or a state sentence of five years less one day.” \nThe County’s website further provides that “[un 2005, the [Hill Facility] maintained \n11 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 12 of 27\na daily average population of 1817 residents.” According to GEO’s most recent Form \n10-K, the “Design Capacity” for the Hill Facility provides for 1,883 inmates.  \n38.  Defendants had no valid reason for conducting a strip search of \nPlaintiffs. Rather, Defendants’ strip search of Plaintiffs — and of all members of the \nClass — was conducted pursuant to a blanket and indiscriminate policy of strip \nsearching each and every detainee processed at the Hill Facility and at the \nFacilities.  \nTHE DEFENDANTS’ WIDESPREAD ILLEGAL STRIP \nSEARCH PRACTICE OR POLICY AT THE FACILITIES \n \n39.  Upon information and belief, GEO and the John Doe Defendants \noperate the Facilities pursuant to a contract entered into with a state or local \ngovernment.  According to its SEC filings, GEO claims that it “operate[s] each \nfacility in accordance with our company-wide policies and procedures and with the \nstandards and guidelines required under the relevant management contract.”  \n40.  In carrying out its contractual arrangements with various government \nentities to maintain, supervise, manage and oversee the Facilities, Defendant GEO \nhas served as a governmental actor for purposes of, among other things, liability \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the United States Constitution. The administration of a \njail is an activity that is traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the government. \nThe Facilities that are operated by Defendant GEO have all of the attributes of \nother jails that are publicly run by the government. Furthermore, by entering into \nagreements that call for Defendant GEO to operate and manage the Facilities \n(which has resulted in the imposition of the Illegal Strip Search Practice or Policy \n12 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 13 of 27\nby Defendants), the various governmental entities with which GEO has contracted \nhave affirmatively facilitated, encouraged, or authorized unlawful acts against its \ncitizens. For purposes of this action, Defendants are governmental actors who stand \nin the shoes of the government(s) on whose behalf it was operating the Facilities. \nIndeed, Defendant GEO’s most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC provides that \n“we are required under our contracts to indemnify the contracting governmental \nagency for all claims and costs arising out of our management of facilities and, in \nsome instances, we are required to maintain performance bonds relating to the \nconstruction, development, and operation of the facilities.”  \n41.  The named Plaintiffs’ experiences at the Hill Facility were not isolated \nevents. As part of their pre-suit investigation, Plaintiffs Counsel has interviewed \nother pretrial detainees who were charged with relatively minor offenses, and who \nwere also indiscriminately strip searched at the Hill Facility. Furthermore, in an \narticle published in the Philadelphia Inquirer on December 17, 2007, three current \nand former guards at the Hill Facility acknowledged that Defendant GEO Group \nemploys a blanket strip search policy that calls for the strip search of all detainees \nregardless of the crime with which they were charged, and without any showing of \nreasonable suspicion:  \nThe Delaware County jail, now run by a private firm, strip- \nsearches thousands of inmates annually, regardless of charge, \naccording to three current and former guards. County officials \nwould not talk about the strip searches; neither would \nexecutives from the company, the Geo Group of Boca Raton, Fla.  \n \n13 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 14 of 27\n42.  Upon information and belief, Defendant’s Illegal Strip Search Practice \nor Policy is implemented not only at the Hill Facility, but at all jails that \nDefendants are responsible for overseeing and managing all across the United \nStates. Upon information and belief, for example, Defendants’ have employed a \nbroad strip search policy in its Lawrenceville Correctional Center in Lawrenceville, \nVirginia. The fact that the Illegal Strip Search Practice or Policy is part of a \nuniform, company-wide policy at GEO is further demonstrated by GEO’s Form 10-K \nfor the year ended 2006, where it claimed that it “operate[s] each facility in \naccordance with our company-wide policies and procedures and with the standards \nand guidelines required under the relevant management contract.”  \n43.  Upon information and belief, Defendants are responsible for the \nscreening, hiring, training, monitoring, and supervision of its corrections officers \nand other employees at the Facilities. Defendants were directly responsible for the \npolicy making activities at the Facilities, and implemented, enforced, and carried \nout the Illegal Strip Search Practice of Policy.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n44.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(a), 23(b)(2) and \n23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class \nof similarly situated individuals who were strip searched upon admission into one \nor more of the Facilities (the “Class”).  \n45.  Specifically, the Class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as \n \nfollows:  \n14 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 15 of 27\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of one or \nmore of the Facilities after being detained for misdemeanors, summary \noffenses, or other crimes that do not involve the possession or \ndistribution of drugs, possession of weapons, or violent felonies, and \nwho were or will be strip searched upon their admission into one or \nmore of the Facilities pursuant to Defendants’ Illegal Strip Search \nPolicy. Excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their \nrespective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees \nor assignees.  \n \n46.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a \nclass action pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as Plaintiffs and the \nClass satisfy the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy requirements \nfor maintaining a class action under FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a).  \n47.   The number of members in the Class is so numerous as to render \njoinder impracticable. Upon information and belief, there are hundreds of persons \nwho are placed into the Facilities every month - all of whom are members of the \nproposed Class. Indeed, in Defendant’s Hill Facility alone the average daily inmate \npopulation was in excess of 1,800 detainees. In GEO’s 2006 Form 10-K, it claimed \nthat it has “over 54,000 beds under management or for which we had been awarded \ncontracts.” Upon information and belief, the precise size of the Class can be readily \ndetermined from documents and records maintained by Defendants.  \n48.  Joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable because of the large \nnumber of Class members and the fact that Class members are likely dispersed over \na large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of the \ngeographic area served by this Judicial District. Furthermore, upon information \nand belief, many members of the Class are low-income persons, may not speak \n15 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 16 of 27\nEnglish, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights on an \nindividual basis.  \n49.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, \nin that they each possessed the right to be free from unreasonable searches, and \neach were victims of the blanket policy of Defendants that calls for strip searches \nabsent individualized particularized suspicion, as required by law. All members of \nthe Class were detained for non-violent and non-drug related offenses when placed \ninto the custody of the Facilities, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of \nclearly established law.  \n50.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class. \nPlaintiffs, like all members of the Class, possess (and, at all relevant times, \npossessed) a constitutional right to be free from strip searches conducted without \nreasonable suspicion. Plaintiffs and all Class members had their constitutional \nrights violated as a result of being subjected to the blanket strip search policy of \nDefendants. As a result, Plaintiffs and all members of the Class were injured due to \nDefendants’ illegal conduct.  \n51.  Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this \naction and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. Plaintiffs \nhave no interests that are adverse to, or in conflict with, the interests of the \nmembers of the Class.  \n52.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and \nsuccess in the prosecution of class actions and in civil rights litigation. In short, \n16 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 17 of 27\nPlaintiffs’ counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to successfully \nprosecute this action against Defendants, and intends to prosecute this action \nvigorously. Counsel for the Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among members of the \nClass or between counsel and members of the Class.  \n53.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, \nPlaintiffs seek class certification under FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Class \nmembers were subject to the same policy which required the illegal strip search of \nall individuals who are detained and placed into the Facilities. Defendants acted on \ngrounds generally applicable to all class members, thereby making final equitable \nrelief with respect to the Class as a whole appropriate with respect to the \nDefendants.  \n54.  In addition to certification under FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs \nseek certification under FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3).  \n55.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, \nand predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the \nClass. These common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the \ncommon and predominate question of whether the Defendants’ written and/or de \nfacto policy of strip searching all individuals who were committed to the Facilities \nconstitutes a violation of, inter alia, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution; whether Plaintiffs and members of the Class are \nentitled to damages and/or equitable relief and, if so, the measure and nature of this \nrelief.  \n17 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 18 of 27\n56.  A class action is the superior method for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nClass is impracticable given the large number of Class members and the fact that \nthey are dispersed over a large geographical area. Furthermore, the expense and \nburden of individual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual \nmembers of the class to redress the wrongs done to them. The cost to the federal \ncourt system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous. \nIndividualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties \nand the court system. By contrast, the maintenance of this action as a class action \nin this Court presents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of \nthe parties and the court system, and protects the rights of each member of the \nClass.  \n57.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to \naddress the Defendants’ flagrant violations of the civil rights of members of the \nClass.  \n58.  In the alternative to certification under FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3), \nPlaintiffs also seek partial certification under FED. R. CIV. P. 23(c)(4), if appropriate.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nMONETARY DAMAGES FOR VIOLATIONS OF 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nAgainst All Defendants \n \n59.   Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and re-allege each and every \nallegation stated in the preceding paragraphs.  \n18 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 19 of 27\n60.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made \napplicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals detained for non-violent, non drug, and \nnon-weapons possession related offenses absent particularized reasonable suspicion \nthat the individual in question has weapons, drugs, or other contraband.  \n61.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs and Class members.  \n62.  The Defendants’ administration and enforcement of the Illegal Strip \nSearch Policy was the direct causal link between Defendants and the constitutional \ninjuries complained of herein. As such, the Defendants are directly liable for the \ndamages of Plaintiffs and members of the Class.  \n63.  Upon information and belief, Defendants are responsible for \nestablishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the County \nFacilities, and are responsible for the implementation of the strip search policy \nquestioned in this lawsuit. As such, Defendants are responsible for the damages of \nthe Plaintiffs and members of the Class.  \n64.  Upon information and belief, Defendants knew of the strip search \npolicies of the Facilities, and acquiesced in strip searches conducted pursuant to \nthese policies. Defendants’ failure to take action with respect to these policies was \nthe moving force behind the violations of the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Class. By maintaining and/or acquiescing in the Illegal Strip Search \n19 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 20 of 27\nPractice or Policy, Defendants were deliberately indifferent to the risk of \nconstitutional injury to the Plaintiffs and member of the Class.  \n65.  This conduct on the part of the Defendants represents a violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, given that their unlawful actions were undertaken under color of \nstate law.  \nCOUNT II \nDEMAND FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT \nAgainst All Defendants \n \n66.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and re-allege each and every \nallegation stated in the preceding paragraphs.  \n67.  The policy, custom and practice of the Defendants is clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the \nstrip searches of all individuals placed into the Facilities based solely on \nDefendants’ blanket strip search policy and without any particularized reasonable \nsuspicion that the individuals in question have either weapons, drugs, or other \ncontraband.  \n68.  There exists a present case or controversy between Defendants on the \none hand, and Plaintiffs and Class members on the other. Without limitation, these \nlive issues include whether Defendants’ strip search policy, custom and practice is \nunconstitutional, and whether Plaintiffs and members of the Class have been \ninjured as a result of this policy, custom and practice.  \n20 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 21 of 27\n69.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class respectfully request that this \nCourt issue a declaratory judgment against Defendants that declares the Illegal \nStrip Search Practice or Policy of Defendants to be unconstitutional.  \n70.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs and members of the Class would be \nirreparably injured absent an order from this Court declaring these practices \nunlawful and unconstitutional, as Plaintiffs and Class members lack an adequate \nremedy at law to stop and remedy this illegal conduct.  \nCOUNT III \nDEMAND FOR PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION \nAgainst All Defendants \n \n71.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and re-allege each and every \nallegation stated in the preceding paragraphs. \n72.  The policy, custom and practice of the Defendants is unconstitutional, \nin that it authorizes the strip searches of all individuals placed into the Facilities \nwithout any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons.  \n73.  Upon information and belief, this policy was, until shortly after the \nfiling of this complaint, in place at the Facilities, with new and/or prospective \nmembers of the Class being subjected to the harms that have already been inflicted \nupon the Plaintiffs.   An injunction is necessary to ensure that, inter alia, any new \npolicies are lawful, to ensure that the practices at all of the Facilities are in \ncompliance with the law, and to prevent Defendants from reverting to the prior \nunconstitutional blanket strip search policy. \n21 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 22 of 27\n74.  The continuing pattern of unconstitutionally strip searching \nindividuals has caused and will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or \nprospective members of the Class, an adequate remedy for which does not exist at \nlaw.  \n75.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class would be irreparably injured \nabsent an order from this Court declaring these practices unlawful and \nunconstitutional.  \n76.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class are reasonably likely to succeed \nthe on merits of their underlying claim, thereby making the issuance of a \npreliminary injunction appropriate.  \nCOUNT IV \nBATTERY \nAgainst All Defendants \n \n77.  This count is being plead in the alternative to Counts I through III, \nand only to the extent that Defendant GEO and/or its agents are considered to be \nafforded any sovereign immunity defenses.  \n78.  Defendants acted intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact \nwith Plaintiff and members of the Class.  \n79.  A harmful contact with the Plaintiffs and Class members directly or \nindirectly resulted.  \n80.  Plaintiffs have suffered injuries as a result of Defendants’ conduct.  \n \n \n22 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 23 of 27\nCOUNT V \nNEGLIGENCE \nAgainst All Defendants \n \n81.  This count is being plead in the alternative to Counts I through III, \nand only to the extent that Defendant GEO and/or its agents are considered to be \nafforded any sovereign immunity defenses.  \n82.  Defendants had a duty to act reasonably under the circumstances.  \n83.  Defendants breached this duty by, inter alia, subjecting Plaintiffs and \nClass members to its Illegal Strip Search Practice or Policy.  \n84.  Plaintiffs and Class members were injured as a direct and proximate \ncause of Defendants’ negligence, and as a result of being subjected to Defendants’ \nIllegal Strip Search Practice or Policy.  \n85.  The injuries suffered by Plaintiffs and Class members were reasonably \nforeseeable.  \nCOUNT VI \nINTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS \nAgainst All Defendants \n \n86.  This count is being plead in the alternative to Counts I through III, \nand only to the extent that Defendant GEO and/or its agents are considered to be \nafforded any sovereign immunity defenses.  \n87.  Defendants’ conduct as described herein is extreme and outrageous.  \n88.  Defendants’ extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or \nrecklessly caused severe emotional distress to Plaintiff and Class members.  \n \n23 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 24 of 27\nCOUNT VII \nNEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS \nAgainst All Defendants \n \n89.  This count is being plead in the alternative to Counts I through III, \nand only to the extent that Defendant GEO and/or its agents are considered to be \nafforded any sovereign immunity defenses.  \n90.  While in their custody and control, Defendant had a contractual or \nfiduciary duty toward Plaintiff and Class members.  \n91.  Plaintiff suffered a physical impact as a result of Defendants’ conduct \ndescribed herein.  \n92.  Plaintiffs were in a “zone of danger” and at risk of an immediate \nphysical injury as a result of Defendants’ conduct described herein.  \n93.  Defendants owed a duty of care to the Plaintiffs and Class members.  \n94.  Defendant breached that duty.  \n95.  The breach resulted in injury to Plaintiffs and Class members.  \n96.  Plaintiffs and Class members have suffered an actual loss or damage  \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n97.  The actions of the Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that \nthey constitute an illegal strip search policy in the face of numerous court decisions \ndeclaring such practices unlawful. The actions of the Defendants were undertaken \nwith reckless disregard and callous indifference to the Fourth and Fourteenth \nrights of Plaintiffs and Class members.  \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n24 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 25 of 27\n98.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class hereby demand a trial by jury.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and on behalf of a Class of \nothers similarly situated, respectfully request that this Court grant them the \nfollowing relief:  \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to FED. R. \nCIV. P. 23(a), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3);  \nB.  An order against Defendants on Plaintiffs causes of action detailed \nherein, awarding compensatory damages to Plaintiffs and each member of the \nproposed class in an amount to be determined at trial;  \nC.  A declaratory judgment against Defendants declaring Defendants’ \npolicy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity searching all pretrial detainees \nentering the Facilities, regardless of the crime charged or suspicion of weapons, \ndrugs, or other contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. Further, Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that this Court issue a declaratory judgment declaring that \nPlaintiff and Class members have been injured as a result of the unconstitutional \nactions of Defendants  \nD.  The issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent \nDefendants from continuing to violate the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and \nClass members.  An injunction is necessary in order to ensure that, inter alia, any \nchanges to the Defendants’ policies are lawful, to ensure that the actual practices at \nthe Facilities are in compliance with the law and the policies, and to prevent \n25 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 16    Filed 03/28/08   Page 26 of 27\nDefendants from reverting back to the prior unconstitutional blanket strip search \npolicy.; and  \nE.

(“GEO”), moves this Court to examine the lack of \nfactual foundation for several counts of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, and, under the recent \nclarification in the standard required for withstanding a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6), dismiss Counts IV, VI, and VII of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint.  Plaintiffs Penny \nAllison  and  Zoran  Hocevar  (collectively,  “Plaintiffs”)  purport  to  bring  this  lawsuit  against \nDefendant GEO and as yet unnamed other defendants on behalf of himself as an individual, and \nthose similarly situated to him, as alleged in the Complaint.   \n  As shown below, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint fails to allege the necessary facts to \nstate claims under three counts of their Complaint:  Battery (Count IV), Intentional Infliction of \nEmotional Distress (Count VI), and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (Count VII).  \nBecause Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint fails to allege these essential elements, these counts \nshould be dismissed. \nII.  FACTS AS ALLEGED BY PLAINTIFF \nA.  The Allegations Regarding GEO’s Conduct \n1.  Penny Allison \n  Plaintiff  Allison  (“Allison”)  contends  that  she  was  arrested  for  driving  under  the \ninfluence (“DUI”) in November 2005.  Amended Complaint ¶ 25.  She contends that she was \nplaced into Pennsylvania’s Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program (“ARD”).  Amended \nComplaint ¶ 25.  Allison paid court costs in July 2006, but contends that she failed to appear for \nthe required ARD hearing.  Amended Complaint ¶ 25; Pa. R. Crim. P. 312, 313.  The missed \ncourt hearing resulted in a bench warrant being issued for Allison’s arrest.  Amended Complaint \n¶ 26. \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 24-1    Filed 05/02/08   Page 3 of 11\n \n  During a traffic stop for expired registration by Springfield Township Police on July 25, \n2006,  Allison  was  arrested  for  the  failure-to-appear  outstanding  bench  warrant.    Amended \nComplaint ¶ 26.  Upon her arrest, she was ultimately brought to George W. Hill Correctional \nFacility in Delaware County (“GWH”).  Amended Complaint ¶ 26.  Allison contends that she \nwas strip-searched visually by a female corrections officer, despite the lack of a reasonable \nsuspicion that she was carrying any contraband.  Amended Complaint ¶ 27.  Alison was released \napproximately eight days later.  Amended Complaint ¶ 28. \n  Allison further contends that she was later arrested again for another unrelated DUI, to \nwhich she pled guilty.  Amended Complaint ¶ 29.  She entered into a DUI weekend program at \nGWH  in  November  2007,  serving  her  conviction  over  approximately  fifteen  weekends.  \nAmended Complaint ¶ 29.  She contends that upon each entry into the weekend facility, she was \nstrip searched visually.  Amended Complaint ¶ 29. \n2.  Zoran Hocevar \nZoran Hocevar (“Hocevar”) was arrested in March 2005 after a domestic dispute with his \nwife.  Amended Complaint ¶ 32.  In August 2007, he contends that all of his charges were \ndismissed except the charge for harassment.  Amended Complaint ¶ 32.  On June 26, 2006, a \nbench warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to appear for a required court hearing.  \nAmended Complaint ¶ 33. \n In  July  2007,  Hocevar  was  stopped  “in  his  car”  –  apparently  for  a  routine  traffic \nviolation – and was arrested pursuant to the outstanding bench warrant.  Amended Complaint ¶ \n34.  He was brought to GWH, where he contends that he was visually strip searched.  Amended \nComplaint ¶ 34. \n  - 2 - \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 24-1    Filed 05/02/08   Page 4 of 11\n \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Against GEO \n  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint  purports  to  assert  seven  counts  against  GEO:  1) \nMonetary  Damages  for  Violation  of  §  1983;  2)  Declaratory  Judgment  [under  §  1983];  3) \nPreliminary and Permanent Injunction [under § 1983]; 4) battery; 5) negligence; 6) intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress; and 7) negligent infliction of emotional distress.  The first three \ncounts are essentially all a single § 1983 count, broken out by the type of relief sought.  Plaintiffs \ndemand compensatory and punitive damages, as well as a judgment declaring the strip search \npolicy unconstitutional and an injunction against enforcement of the policy.  Plaintiffs also seek \nattorneys’  fees  and  costs.    Plaintiffs  demand  monetary  damages  from  Defendants  in  their \nindividual, official, and personal capacities – although to date, only GEO has been named as a \ndefendant in this case.   \nC.  Lack of Factual Allegations Regarding Multiple Counts of Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint                   \n  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint lacks the essential factual allegations to properly state \nclaims  for  battery  (Count  IV),  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  (Count  VI),  and \nnegligent infliction of emotional distress (Count VII) under Pennsylvania law.  Plaintiffs allege, \nat most, that they were subjected to visual strip searches.  Allison contends that after disrobing in \nfront  of  a  female  corrections  officer,  she  was  instructed  to  squat  and  cough.    Amended \nComplaint ¶ 27.  Hocevar contends he was “subject to a strip search in a room with a number of \nother individuals.”  Amended Complaint ¶ 34.   \n  Nowhere  in  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint  do  they  allege  that  they,  or  any  other \npotential plaintiff, were ever subject to more invasive searching than that described above.  \nFurthermore, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint fails to allege that either named Plaintiff, or any \nother potential plaintiff here, suffered any physical injury, harm or illness caused by any alleged \n  - 3 - \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 24-1    Filed 05/02/08   Page 5 of 11\n \nact by Defendant GEO.  Nor does Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint allege that either named \nPlaintiff, or any other potential plaintiff here, witnessed any family member subjected to any \nwrongful and/or traumatizing act by Defendant GEO.  \n  As set forth below, the dearth of factual allegations in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint \nnecessitates that, under Pennsylvania law, this Court dismiss their purported claims for Battery \n(Count IV), Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (Count VI), and Negligent Infliction of \nEmotional Distress (Count VII).   \nIII.  ARGUMENT \n \n  The factual allegations in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint are insufficient to state claims \nfor the torts of battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of \nemotional distress under Pennsylvania law.  The legal sufficiency of a complaint is tested by a \nmotion to dismiss. Whitehead v. Craftmatic Organization, No. Civ. A. 94-7770, 1995 WL \n327987, at *3 (E.D. Pa. May 30, 1995) (citing Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. \nIndus., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1042 (1994)); see also ALA, \nInc. v. CCAIR, Inc., 29 F.3d 855, 859 (3d Cir. 1994); Lee v. Maleski, Civ. A. No. 94-6331, 1995 \nWL 3669, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 4, 1995) (citing Pennsylvania ex. rel. Zimmerman v. PepsiCo, \nInc., 836 F.2d 173, 179 (3d Cir. 1988)). \nA.  A Complaint Must Allege “More Than Labels And Conclusions” But  \n  Must Plead Enough Facts To Raise A Right To Relief Above “Speculative” \n \nIn Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. ---, 127 S. Ct. 1955 (May 21, 2007), the \nSupreme Court expressly “retired” the 50-year old statement in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, \n45-46 (1957), that “a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it \nappears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which \nwould entitle him to relief.”  As stated by the Supreme Court, “after puzzling the profession for \n  - 4 - \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 24-1    Filed 05/02/08   Page 6 of 11\n \n50 years, this famous observation has earned its retirement. The phrase is best forgotten as an \nincomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading standard: once a claim has been stated \nadequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the \ncomplaint.”  Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at  1969.   \nInstead, “Rule 8(a)(2) . . . requires a ‘showing,’ rather than a blanket assertion, of \nentitlement to relief.  Without some factual allegation in the complaint, it is hard to see how a \nclaimant could satisfy the requirement of providing not only ‘fair notice’ of the nature of the \nclaim, but also ‘grounds’ on which the claim rests.”  Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965 n.3.  “Rule 8(a) \n‘contemplate[s] the statement of circumstances, occurrences, and events in support of the claim \npresented’ and does not authorize a pleader’s ‘bare averment that he wants relief and is entitled \nto it.’”  Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965 n.3 (quoting 5 WRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND \nPROCEDURE § 1202, at 94, 95 (3d ed. 2004)).  “While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations . . . a plaintiff’s obligation to provide \nthe ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a \nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at \n1964-65 (citations omitted).  “Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above \nthe speculative level,” and “‘the pleading must contain something more . . . than . . . a statement \nof facts that merely creates a suspicion [of] a legally cognizable right of action.’”  Twombly, 127 \nS. Ct. at 1965 (quoting 5 C. WRIGHT & A. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1216, \nat. 235-236).   \n“Labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action” \nare insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss; rather, the factual allegations in the complaint \n“must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at \n  - 5 - \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 24-1    Filed 05/02/08   Page 7 of 11\n \n1964-65; see Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 232 (3d Cir. 2008) (§ 1983 suit) \n(“After Twombly, it is no longer sufficient to allege mere elements of a cause of action; instead, \n‘a complaint must allege facts suggestive of [the proscribed] conduct.’”) (quoting Twombly, 127 \nS. Ct. at 1969 n.8).  As the Third Circuit has recently held, “without some factual allegation[s] in \nthe complaint, a claimant cannot satisfy the requirement that he or she provide not only ‘fair \nnotice,’ but also the ‘grounds’ on which the claim rests.”  Phillips, 515 F.3d at 232 (emphasis \nadded) (construing 12(b)(6) standard pursuant to Twombly). \nFurther, on a motion to dismiss, courts “are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion \ncouched as a factual allegation.”  Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986).  In deciding \nwhether a claim for relief is supported, a court must consider only the facts that are alleged, and \nnot un-alleged facts that a plaintiff might later prove.  Assoc. Contractors of California, Inc. v. \nCalifornia State Counsel of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526, 103 S. Ct. 897, 902, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 \n(1983); see also Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (on a \nmotion to dismiss, a court need not assume that the plaintiff can prove facts that were not alleged \nin the complaint or credit a complaint’s “bald assertions” or “legal conclusions”). A complaint \nmust be dismissed where a plaintiff fails to make “some showing sufficient to justify moving the \ncase beyond the pleadings to the next stage of litigation.”  Phillips, 515 F.3d at 235. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Battery Claim Must Be Dismissed \n \n  Under Pennsylvania law, to state a claim for the tort of battery, a plaintiff must allege in \nthe Amended Complaint “a harmful or offensive contact with a person, resulting from an act \nintended to cause the plaintiff or a third person to suffer such a contact, or apprehension that such \na contact is imminent.”  Levenson v. Souser, 557 A.2d 1081, 1088 (Pa. Super. 1989) (quoting \nProsser and Keeton, Law of Torts, at 39 (5th ed. 1984)).   \n  - 6 - \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 24-1    Filed 05/02/08   Page 8 of 11\n \n  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint contains only bald assertions that recite these familiar \nlegal elements – but in no way specifies any factual allegations that support these legal elements.  \nSee Amended Compl. ¶¶ 78-80.  As noted above, there is no allegation that any person touched \nPlaintiffs Allison or Hocevar during the alleged strip searches, and there is no allegation that \nPlaintiffs Allison or Hocevar ever had an apprehension that any physical contact was imminent.  \nFurthermore, there are no allegations that any other potential plaintiffs here were touched or had \napprehension that physical contact was imminent.  \n  Accordingly,  under  the  standard  testing  the  sufficiency  of  allegations  as  stated  in \nTwombly, and in consideration of the essential elements in a claim of battery, Defendant GEO \nrespectfully requests that this Court dismiss Plaintiffs’ purported claim for Battery in Count IV \nof their Amended Complaint. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Intentional Infliction of  \n  Emotional Distress Claim Must Be Dismissed \n \n  Intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  arises  when  “one  who  by  extreme  and \noutrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another.”  \nCorbett v. Morgenstern, 934 F. Supp. 680 (E.D. Pa. 1996) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \n§  46(1)).    Even  if  the  allegations  in  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint  rise  to  the  level  of \n“outrageous”  conduct  as  required  under  Pennsylvania  law,  to  state  a  claim  for  intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must allege some physical injury, harm or illness \ncaused by the defendant’s conduct.  Corbett, 934 F. Supp. at 684.   \n  Here, Plaintiffs do not allege any facts sufficient to establish the requisite physical injury, \nharm or illness necessary to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under \nPennsylvania law.  Rather, Plaintiffs at most aver empty recitations of the legal requirements as \nfollows: \n  - 7 - \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 24-1    Filed 05/02/08   Page 9 of 11\n \n¶ 24:  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful \nstrip searches have suffered and in the future will suffer psychological \npain, humiliation, and mental anguish. \n¶ 31:  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-searches conducted \npursuant to Defendants’ policy, practice and custom, Plaintiff Allison has \nsuffered injuries. \n¶ 35:  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-searches conducted \npursuant to Defendants’ policy, practice and custom, Hocevar has suffered \ninjuries. \n¶ 88:  Defendants’ extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly \ncaused severe emotional distress to Plaintiff and Class members. \nUnder the Twombly standard of pleading discussed supra, Plaintiffs have failed to plead factual \nassertions sufficient to establish the injury element of this purported claim.  Because Plaintiffs’ \nAmended Complaint fails to plead this essential element of intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress,  Count  IV  purporting  to  allege  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  must  be \ndismissed. \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Negligent Infliction of  \n  Emotional Distress Claim Must Be Dismissed  \n \n  Under Pennsylvania law, negligent infliction of emotional distress is a narrow tort, which \ngenerally requires the plaintiff to have witnessed an accident or traumatic injury to a close \nrelative, caused by the defendant.  See, e.g., Love v. Cramer, 606 A.2d 1175 (Pa. Super. 1992).  \nIf a person “does not experience a sensory and contemporaneous observance of the injury,” then \nthey cannot state a claim.  Id.  The person seeking the damages must suffer physical injury as a \nresult of actually witnessing the harm to a close relative.  Id. (citing Mazzagatti v. Everingham by \nEveringham, 512 Pa. 266, 516 A.2d 672 (1986). \n  Plaintiffs’ Complaint clearly lacks the essential elements to state a claim of negligent \ninfliction of emotional distress.  See Amended Compl., Count VII.  Plaintiffs merely allege that \n  - 8 - \n \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00467-JD   Document 24-1    Filed 05/02/08   Page 10 of 11\n \nthey himself were subject to an unconstitutional visual strip search, and that others similarly \nsituated to him were subject to the same alleged searches.  They do not even allege that they \nwitnessed any strip searches of any close relative.  See id.  Nor does Plaintiffs’ Amended \nComplaint that they, or any potential plaintiff, witnessed a close relative come to harm by any act \nof Defendant GEO.  See id.   \n  Thus, once again, Plaintiffs’ bald assertions that merely recite the requisite elements of \nthe purported claim are insufficient to survive Defendant’s motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. \nP.  12(b)(6).    Accordingly,  this  Court  should  dismiss  Count  VII  of  Plaintiffs’  Amended \nComplaint. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendant GEO respectfully requests that this Court dismiss \nCount IV (Battery), Count VI (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress), and Count VII \n(Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress) of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, with prejudice. \n            Respectfully submitted, \n             \n  “s”/ Carolyn P.
