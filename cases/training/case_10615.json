    "summary": "<p>On August 22, 2007, a prisoner filed suit against the County of Lancaster and the Lancaster County Prison Board in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  He alleged that his constitutional rights were violated when he was strip searched in front of other inmates upon arrival at the Lancaster County Prison after being arrested for a parole violation. He claimed that the blanket policy of strip searching all newly-arrived detainees regardless of the offense and without judgment as to whether or not such a search was reasonable violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  His cause of action was 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and he was represented by private counsel.  He sought class action certification, declaratory judgment, a preliminary and permanent injunction, and punitive damages. </p><p>The parties proceeded into discovery and also pursued a settlement.  In a one sentence opinion on June 13, 2008, the court (Judge Paul S. Diamond) denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification without prejudice.  The parties continued negotiations and submitted a settlement agreement with the court on July 29, 2009.   The settlement specified a class of those stripped searched upon admittance to Lancaster County Prison for minor offense not involving drugs, weapons, or violence between August 22, 2005 and July 28, 2009.  It affirmed the new policy of the defendants not to strip search such detainees, specified that the defendant would train all of its employees to comply with the new policy, and allowed class counsel to monitor compliance.  It also created a fund of $2,507,200.00 to be used to compensate class members.  Provisional class certification and preliminary approval of the settlement was granted by the court (Judge Diamond) on September 1, 2009.  The case came to a close on April 9, 2010 when the court (Judge Diamond) certified the class and granted final approval to the settlement. Two years later, documents under seal were unsealed pursuant to local rules. There has been no further activity, and the case now appears to be closed. </p>",

The Lancaster\nCounty Prison Board, an agency of the County of Lancaster, has a uniform\npractice and procedure of strip-searching all individuals who enter the\nLancaster County Prison and are placed in prison clothing, regardless of the\ncrime or violation for which they are detained. Upon information and belief,\nthis uniform practice and procedure is, in part, derived from the written\nprocedures of the Lancaster County Prison Board, and was promulgated by\nsenior Board members.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 2 of 21\nIt is well established that individuals charged with misdemeanors,\nsummary violations, or other similar charges and/or crimes cannot be strip\nsearched upon entry or transfer to the Lancaster County Prison absent\nparticularized suspicion that those detainees possess weapons or contraband.\nIn short, the uniform practice and procedure of Lancaster County and the\nLancaster County Prison Board to force those charged with such crimes to\nundergo the indignities of a strip search upon transfer and/or entry into the\nLancaster County Prison is not only clearly ifiegal, but is insensitive,\nunnecessary, and offensive. What is particularly troubling is that Defendants\nhave continued to engage in this misconduct notwithstanding an overwhelming\nnumber of cases, within this Circuit and others, that have squarely declared\nthese practices to be unlawful and unconstitutional.\nPlaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and a class of thousands\nof others who were unconstitutionally strip searched to vindicate the clear and\nunnecessary violations of their civil rights. Plaintiff was charged with a non-\nfelony offense and was subjected to a strip search in violation of his rights\nagainst unreasonable searches guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution, which is made applicable to the states by the\nFourteenth Amendment. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for himself and on\nbehalf of the proposed class, a declaration that the Prison Board's uniform\npractices and procedures are unconstitutional, and an injunction preventing\nLancaster County and the Lancaster County Prison Board from continuing to\n-2-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 3 of 21\nviolate the rights of those placed into their custody. With this as a background,\nPlaintiff complains as follows:\nJURISDICTION\n1. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of\n28 U.S.C. ยง 1331, 1341 and 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory\ndamages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under\ncolor of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured by the\nConstitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 and 1983. This Court\nalso has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ยง\n2201,\nas it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the\npolicies of a local government.\n2. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง because the events\n1391(e)(2)\ngiving rise to Plaintiff's claims and those of proposed class members occurred\nin this judicial district.\nPARTIES\n3. Plaintiff Sajan Kurian (\"Kurian\" or \"Plaintiff\") is an adult male\nindividual who resides in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. On or about Tuesday, April\n11th, 2006, Kurian was arrested and placed in the Lancaster County Prison for a\ntechnical violation of parole for a driving while intoxicated arrest in York\nCounty.\n-3-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 4 of 21\n4. Defendant County of Lancaster (the \"County\") is a county\ngovernment organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania. The County can be served at 50 North Duke Street in Lancaster,\nPennsylvania. At all times relevant hereto, the County, acting through its Prison\nBoard, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation\nand conduct of all matters pertaining to the Lancaster County Prison and was\nresponsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Prison\nBoard personnel, including those working in the Lancaster County Prison. In\naddition, at all relevant times, the County was responsible for enforcing the\nrules of the Lancaster County Prison, and for ensuring that Prison Board\npersonnel employed in the Prison obey the Constitution and laws of the United\nStates and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n5. The Lancaster County Prison Board (the \"Prison Board\") is an entity\norganized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\nand can be served at the Lancaster County Courthouse, 50 North Duke Street,\nRoom 502, Lancaster, Pennsylvania PA 17602. At all times relevant hereto, the\nPrison Board was responsible for operating, organizing, overseeing and\nadministering the Lancaster County Prison (the \"Prison\"). At all times relevant\nhereto, Defendant Prison Board, together with the County of Lancaster, was\nresponsible for the polices, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct\nof all matters pertaining to the Prison, and was responsible for the\nappointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Prison Board personnel,\nincluding those working in the Prison. In addition, at all times relevant hereto,\n-4-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 5 of 21\nDefendant Prison Board, together with the County of Lancaster, was responsible\nfor enforcing the rules of the Prison, and for ensuring that Prison Board\npersonnel employed in the Prison obeyed the Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n6. Various other persons (including without limitation, Corrections\nOfficers) and govermnental agencies or entities (collectively the \"John Doe\nDefendants\"), the identities of which are presently unknown, have participated\nas co-conspirators with Defendants in the violations alleged herein and have\nperformed acts in furtherance thereof. The acts charged in this Complaint have\nbeen done by Defendants and their co-conspirators, or were authorized,\nordered or done by their respective officers, agents, employees or\nrepresentatives.\n7. Collectively, the County of Lancaster, the Lancaster County Prison\nBoard, and the John Doe Defendants shall be referred to herein as\n\"Defendants.\"\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n8. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 2 3(a), 23(b)(2) and\n23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of himself and a class\nof similarly situated individuals who were detained for misdemeanors,\nsummary offenses, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil\ncommitments, or other similar charges and/or crimes and were strip searched\nupon their transfer and/or entry into the Lancaster County Prison (the \"Class\").\n9. The Class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows:\n-5-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 6 of 21\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the\ncustody of the Lancaster County Prison after being\ndetained for misdemeanors, summary offenses,\nviolations of probation or parole, traffic infractions,\ncivil conmiitments, or other similar charges and/or\ncrimes and were or will be strip searched upon their\ntransfer and/or entry into the Lancaster County Prison\npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the\nLancaster County Prison Board and the County of\nLancaster. Specifically excluded from the class are\nDefendants and any and all of their respective\naffiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors,\nemployees or assignees.\n10. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a\nclass action pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as Plaintiff and\nthe Class satisfy the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy\nrequirements for maintaining a class action under FED. R. Civ. P. 2 3(a).\n11. The number of members in the Class is so numerous as to render\njoinder impracticable. Upon information and belief, there are hundreds of\npeople detained for misdemeanors and other violations who are placed into the\ncustody of the Prison every month - all of whom are members of the proposed\nClass. Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed Class totals at\nleast 5,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on\nmultiple occasions. Upon information and belief, the precise size of the Class\ncan be readily determined from documents and records maintained by\nDefendants.\n12. Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is\nimpracticable because of the large number of Class members and the fact that\nClass members are likely dispersed over a large geographical area, with some\n-6-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 7 of 21\nmembers presently residing outside of Lancaster County and the geographic\narea served by this Judicial District. Furthermore, upon information and belief,\nmany members of the Class are low-income persons, may not speak English,\nand likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights on an individual\nbasis.\n13. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the\nClass, in that they each possessed the right to be free from unreasonable\nsearches, and each were victims of Defendants' blanket policy of conducting\nstrip searches absent individualized particularized suspicion, as required by\nlaw. All members of the Class were detained for misdemeanors, summary\noffenses, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil\ncommitments, or other similar charges and/or crimes when placed into the\ncustody of the Prison, and all were ifiegally strip searched in violation of well\nestablished law.\n14. Plaintiff's claims are typical of the claims of the members of the\nClass. Plaintiff and all members of the Class were injured as a result of\nDefendants' ifiegal conduct. The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of\nthe harms suffered by the Class members.\n15. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in\nthe outcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests\nof the Class. Plaintiff has no interests that are adverse to, or in conflict with,\nthe interests of the members of the Class.\n-7-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 8 of 21\n16. Plaintiff has retained counsel who have substantial experience and\nsuccess in the prosecution of class actions and in civil rights litigation. In short,\nPlaintiff's counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to successfully\nprosecute this action against Lancaster County and the Lancaster County Prison\nBoard, and intends to prosecute this action vigorously. Counsel for the Plaintiff\nknows of no conflicts among members of the Class or between counsel and\nmembers of the Class.\n17. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As\nsuch, the Plaintiff seeks class certification under FED. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2),in that\nall Class members were subject to the same policy which required the ifiegal\nstrip searches of individuals detained for misdemeanors, summary offenses,\nviolations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments, or\nother similar charges and/or crimes and placed into the custody of the Prison.\nThe County of Lancaster and the Lancaster County Prison Board acted on\ngrounds generally applicable to all class members, thereby making appropriate\nfinal equitable relief with respect to the Class as a whole.\n18. In addition to certification under FED. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), Plaintiff\nseeks certification under FED. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\n19. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the\nClass, and predominate over any questions that affect only individual members\nof the Class. These common questions of law and fact include, without\nlimitation, the common and predominate question of whether the Defendants'\nwritten and/or de facto policy of strip searching all individuals detained for\n-8-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 9 of 21\nmisdemeanors, summary offenses, violations of probation or parole, traffic\ninfractions, civil commitments, or other similar charges and/or crimes and\ncommitted to the Prison is a violation of, inter alia, the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, whether such a written and/or\ndefacto policy existed during the class period, whether Plaintiff and members of\nthe Class are entitled to damages and/or equitable relief and, if so, the nature\nof this relief.\n20. A class action is the superior method for the fair and efficient\nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individuall members\nof the Class is impracticable given the large number of Class members and the\nfact that they are dispersed over a large geographical area. Furthermore, the\nexpense and burden of individual litigation would make it difficult or\nimpossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to\nthem. The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of\nindividual cases would be enormous. Individualized litigation would also\nmagnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system. By contrast,\nthe maintenance of this action as a class action in this Court presents far fewer\nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court\nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class.\n21. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to\naddress the Defendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of members of the\nClass.\n-9-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 10 of 21\n22. In the alternative to certification under FED. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3),\nPlaintiff also seeks partial certification under FED. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4), if\nappropriate.\nFACTS\nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally\n23. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made\napplicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits state officials,\nsuch as the Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they\nsupervise, from performing strip searches of arrestees who have been detained\nfor misdemeanors, summary offenses, violations of probation or parole, traffic\ninfractions, civil commitments, or other similar charges and/or crimes unless\nthe corrections officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the detainee is\nconcealing a weapon or contraband.\n24. Upon information and belief, the Defendants have instituted a\nwritten and/or de factopolicy, custom or practice of strip searching all\nindividuals who enter the custody of the Lancaster County Prison and are\nplaced into Prison clothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime or\nviolation and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the\nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband.\n25. Upon information and belief, the Defendants have instituted a\nwritten and/or de factopolicy, custom or practice of conducting visual body\ncavity searches (visual inspection of the vaginal and rectal cavities) on all\nindividuals who enter the custody of the Lancaster County Prison, regardless of\n-10-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 11 of 21\nthe individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime or violation.\nFor purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively\nreferred to as (\"strip searches\").\n26. The Defendants know - orshould know - that they may not\ninstitute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy or practice of conducting\nstrip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion. Upon information\nand belief, the Lancaster Prison's written policy was based on the policy\npromulgated by the Lancaster County Prison Board.\n27. The Defendants' written and/or defactopolicy,practice and custom\nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation detainees\nhas been promulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to\nclearly established law and to the United States Constitution.\n28. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate\nfrom the particular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature\nof the crime charged or violation, the particular characteristics of the arrestees,\nand/or the circumstances of the arrest.\n29. Upon information and belief, the Defendants have promulgated,\nimplemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or defacto policy,\npractice or custom of uniformly strip searching all individuals placed into the\ncustody of the Lancaster Prison and placed into Prison clothing without any\nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort. This\nwritten and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees\nroutine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the\n-11-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 12 of 21\narrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the\nenforcement of the policy, practice andcustomof routine strip searches.\n30. Pursuant to this written and/or defacto policy, each member of the\nClass, including the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search\nupon their transfer and/or entry into the Lancaster County Prison. These\nsearches were conducted without any inquiry into or establishment of\nreasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by any reasonable\nsuspicion. Strip searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among\nother offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment, Trespassing, Failure to\nPay Child Support, and violations of probation and parole for misdemeanor\noffenses; none of which signal the particularized reasonable suspicion that the\ndetainee is concealing a weapon or contraband.\n31. As a direct and proximate result of the unllawful strip searches\nconducted pursuant to this written and/or defacto policy, the victims of the\nunlawful strip searches --eachmember of the class, including the named\nPlaintiff -- has suffered or will suffer psychological pain, humiliation, and\nmental anguish.\n32. Upon information and belief, Defendants often -ifnot always -\nconductthe strip searches in the presence of other detainees, prison officials,\nand other personnel, thereby adding to the humiliation suffered by members of\nthe Class.\n42-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 13 of 21\nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff\n33. Plaintiff Sajan Kurian is an adult male. On or about Tuesday, April\n11th, 2006, at approximately 4:30 p.m., he was detained at the offices of the\nLancaster County Adult Probation & Parole Services on a technical violation for\nan arrest for the non-felony charge of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.\n34. At the time of his arrest, Kurian was on parole for Driving Under\nthe Influence of Alcohol.\n35. Kurian's technical violation of parole was void of any reasonable\nsuspicion that he harbored any weapons or contraband.\n36. Kurian was patted down by a sheriff at the offices of the Lancaster\nCounty Adult Probation & Parole Services before being transported on a bus to\nthe Prison with additional males.\n37. When Kurian arrived at the prison with the other detainees, and\nbefore being seen by a judge, he was patted down once again by correctional\nofficers. Kurian was then sent through a metal detector. Again, there was no\nindication that Kurian was in possession of contraband or weapons.\n38. Kurian and the other detainees were then instructed to enter a cell,\none by one, where they were strip searched in clear view of the other\nindividuals. Kurian was able to observe other individuals being strip searched\nwhile he was waiting for his iurn to be searched.\n39. In connection with the strip search, Kurian was required to\ncompletely disrobe, lift up his testicles, bend over and cough, all so that he\n-13-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 14 of 21\ncould be visually inspected by a correctional officer who used a flashlight to\ninspect Kurian's anal cavity.\n40. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search\nconducted pursuant to County and Prison Board's policy, practice and custom,\nKurian has suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation,\nsuffering and mental anguish.\nCAUSES OF ACTION\nCOUNT I\nViolations of 42 U.S.C. 1983\nAGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\n41. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every\nallegation stated in paragraphs 1 through 40.\n42. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made\napplicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, protects citizens from\nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from\nconducting strip searches of individuals detained for misdemeanors, summary\noffenses, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil\ncommitments, or other similar charges and/or crimes absent some\nparticularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband\nor weapons.\n43. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiff's rights\nunder the United States Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively\nreasonable for Prison Officers to strip search Plaintiff and Class members based\n-14-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 15 of 21\non their arrests. It was also not objectively reasonable for the Defendants to\norder/direct Lancaster County Corrections Officers to conduct such strip\nsearches.\n44. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy,\ncustom or practice of the County of Lancaster and the Lancaster County Prison\nBoard. As such, the County of Lancaster is directly liable for the damages of\nPlaintiff and members of the Class.\n45. Upon information and belief, the Defendants are responsible for\nestablishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the\nPrison, and are responsible for the implementation of the strip search policy\nquestioned in this lawsuit. As such, the Defendants are each responsible for the\ndamages of the Plaintiff and members of the Class.\n46. The Defendants knew that the Prison's strip search policy was\nifiegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive\nPlaintiff and members of the Class of their Constilutional rights.\n47. Thisconduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of\n42 U.S.C. 1983, given that their unlawfull actions were undertaken under color\nof state law.\n48. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts\ndescribed above, Plaintiff and the members of the Class have suffered damages.\n-15-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 16 of 21\nCOUNT H\nDemand for Declaratory Judgment\nAGAINST ALL DEFENDNATS\n49. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every\nallegation stated in paragraphs 1 through 48.\n50. The policy, custom and practice of the Lancaster County Prison\nBoard and the County of Lancaster is clearly unconstitutional, in that these\nentities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all\nindividuals placed into the Prison without any particularized suspicion that the\nindividuals in question have either contraband or weapons.\n51. Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a\ndeclaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County\nof Lancaster and the Lancaster County Prison Board to be unconstitutional.\n52. Alternatively, Plaintiff and members of the Class lack an adequate\nremedy at law.\n53. Plaintiff and members of the Class would be irreparably injured\nabsent an order from this Court declaring these practices unlawful and\nunconstitutional.\n-16-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 17 of 21\nCOUNT Ill\nDemand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction\nAGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\n54. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every\nallegation stated in paragraphs 1 through 53.\n55. The policy, custom and practice of the Lancaster County Prison\nBoard and the County of Lancaster is clearly unconstitutional, in that these\nentities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all\nindividuals placed into the Prison without any particularized suspicion that the\nindividuals in question have either contraband or weapons.\n56. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the\nPrison, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to\nthe hanns that have already been inificted upon the Plaintiff.\n57. The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals detained for\nmisdemeanors, summary offenses, violations of probation or parole, traffic\ninfractions, civil commitments, or other similar charges and/or crimes will\ncause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, an\nadequate remedy for which does not exist at law.\n58. Plaintiff demands that the County of Lancaster and the Lancaster\nCounty Prison Board immediately desist from uniformly strip searching all\nindividuals placed into the custody of the Prison absent any particularized\nsuspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband or weapons,\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD     Document 1      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 18 of 21\nand seeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court\nordering as much.\n59. Alternatively, Plaintiff and members of the Class lack an adequate\nremedy at law.\n60. Plaintiff and members of the Class would be irreparably injured\nabsent an order from this Court declaring these practices unlawful and\nunconstitutional.\n61. Plaintiff and members of the Class are reasonably likely to succeed\nthe on merits of their underlying claim, thereby making the issuance of a\npreliminary injunction appropriate.\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n62. The actions of the Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in\nthat they continue to propagate an ifiegal strip search policy in the face of\nnumerous court decisions declaring such practices unlawful.\n63. It is clear that the Defendants have no respect for the civil rights of\nindividual citizens or for the rule of law. Consequently, an award of punitive\ndamages is necessary to punish the Defendants, and to send a message to them\nthat the requirements of the United States Constitution indeed apply to\ngovernment officials in Lancaster County.\nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY .IURY\n64.

I grant their Motion.  \nBACKGROUND\nThe Supreme Court has held that in determining the Fourth Amendment reasonableness\nof pretrial detainee strip searches, courts must consider โthe scope of the particular intrusion, the\nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.โ  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979) (upholding prisonโs policy of strip\nsearching all pretrial detainees that had contact visits with outsiders).  Applying Bell, the First,\nSecond, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have held that a pretrial\n1\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 2 of 25\ndetainee charged with a misdemeanor or lesser offense may not be strip searched upon\ncommitment without reasonable suspicion to believe that he or she is concealing a weapon or\ncontraband.  See Allison v. GEO Group, Inc., 611 F. Supp. 2d 433, 451-52 (E.D. Pa. 2009)\n(collecting cases); see also Young v. County of Cook, 616 F. Supp. 2d 834, 846 (N.D. Ill. 2009)\n(โThe crux of these cases is that given the extreme intrusion into personal privacy that a strip\nsearch or body cavity search entails, people charged with minor offenses that do not involve\ndrugs or weapons are not subject to such searches absent individualized reasonable suspicion.  Of\nall the circuits to consider this issue, only the Eleventh Circuit has reached a contrary result.โ);\nbut see Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir. 2008) (โThe difference between\nfelonies and misdemeanors or other lesser offenses is without constitutional significance when it\ncomes to detention facility strip searches.โ).  The Third Circuit has not yet addressed this issue. \nSee Allison, 611 F. Supp. 2d at 437.        \nPlaintiffs filed the instant action on August 22, 2007, alleging that Defendants have\nโinstituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals\nwho enter the custody of the Lancaster County Prison and are placed into Prison clothing,\nregardless of the nature of their charged crime or violation and without the presence of\nreasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband.โ \nCompl. ยถ 24 (Doc. No. 1).  Plaintiffs sought money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and asked me to certify a hybrid Rule 23(b)(2)/(b)(3) class of\nsimilarly situated persons: (1) who, commencing on August 22, 2005, have been or will be\nadmitted to LCP after being detained for misdemeanors or similar offenses โthat do not involve\nthe possession or distribution of drugs, possession of weapons, or are violent feloniesโ; and (2)\n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 3 of 25\nโwho were or will be strip searched upon their entry into [LCP] pursuant to the practice, policy,\nor custom of Defendants.โ  Am. Compl. ยถ 11; Doc. No. 33 at 1. \n  Plaintiffs moved for class certification on November 11, 2007.  (Doc. No. 17.)  On\nNovember 21, 2007, I issued a Scheduling Order and allowed Plaintiffs to submit a renewed\nMotion for Class Certification following class discovery.  (Doc. No. 21.)  Plaintiffs filed an\nAmended Complaint on May 15, 2008, and renewed their Motion for Class Certification on\nOctober 14, 2008.  (Doc. Nos. 28, 32.)  Defendants filed an Opposition on November 4, 2008;\nPlaintiffs filed a Reply on November 14, 2008.  (Doc. Nos. 35, 38, 39.)  Oral argument on\nPlaintiffsโ Motion was scheduled for November 24, 2008.  (Doc. No. 31.)  During a Chambers\nConference before oral argument, however, the Parties agreed to suspend litigation while they\nengaged in settlement discussions.  (Doc. Nos. 42, 43.)  \nThe Parties agreed to settle this matter on March 23, 2009.  (Doc. Nos. 45, 48 at 2.)  Their\nSettlement Agreement (executed on July 28, 2009) provides for a $2,507,200 Settlement Fund,\nwith an initial contribution of $1,946,860.  See Settlement Agreement ยง III.B.1.  The amount\ndistributed to each Class Member -- ranging from $50 to $900 -- will be determined by his or her\nclassification into one of five categories.  Id. ยง III.C.1(i).  These categories are based on various\ncriteria, including: whether the Class Member was on probation or on parole at the time of\nadmission to LCP, and the information disclosed on the individualโs Strip Search Checklist\npertaining to the nature of the charge, whether the detainee has a known history of violence or\ndrug use, and whether the detainee was disruptive or threatening when he or she was admitted. \nId.; see also id., Ex. D.           \nThe Parties jointly filed the instant Motion on July 31, 2009, asking me to: (1) certify\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 4 of 25\nconditionally a Rule 23(b)(3) class for settlement purposes; (2) approve preliminarily the\nSettlement; (3) direct notice of the Settlement to the Class; and (4) schedule a Final Approval\nHearing.  (Doc. No. 48.)  On August 20, 2009, I held a hearing on the Motion.  Doc. No. 52; see\nGates v. Rohm and Haas Co., 248 F.R.D. 434, 438 (E.D. Pa. 2008) (โJudicial review of a\nproposed class settlement generally requires two hearings: one preliminary approval hearing and\none final โfairnessโ hearing.โ).       \nLEGAL STANDARDS\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) provides that โ[t]he claims, issues, or defenses of a\ncertified class may be settled . . . only with the courtโs approval.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).  At the\npreliminary approval stage, I must determine whether the โsettlement falls within the range of\nreason.โ  Gates, 248 F.R.D. at 438 (quotations omitted); see also Manual for Complex Litigation,\nยง 21.632 (4th ed. 2009).  Where a class has not already been certified, I must also independently\ndetermine that the proposed settlement class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.  See Amchem\nv. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 620 (1997); In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Amer. Sales Practices Litig.,\n148 F.3d 283, 308 (3d Cir. 1998) (โ[A] district court must first find [that] a class satisfies the\nrequirements of Rule 23, regardless of whether it certifies the class for trial or settlement.โ); see\nalso Manual for Complex Litigation, ยง 21.632 (4th ed. 2009) (โThe judge should make a\npreliminary determination that the proposed class satisfies the criteria set out in Rule 23(a) and at\nleast one of the subsections of Rule 23(b).โ).  As the Supreme Court has explained:\nConfronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a district court\nneed not inquire whether the case, if tried, would present intractable management\nproblems, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3)(D), for the proposal is that there be\n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 5 of 25\nno trial.  But other specifications of the Rule -- those designed to protect absentees\nby blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions -- demand undiluted, even\nheightened, attention in the settlement context.  Such attention is of vital\nimportance, for a court asked to certify a settlement class will lack the\nopportunity, present when a case is litigated, to adjust the class, informed by the\nproceedings as they unfold.\nAmchem, 521 U.S. at 620.\nIn determining whether to certify, I must accept as true all substantive allegations in the\nAmended Complaint.  See Chiang v. Veneman, 385 F.3d 256, 262 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing Eisen v.\nCarlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1974)).  Although I may not consider whether\nPlaintiffs will prevail on the merits, I must โmake whatever factual and legal inquiries are\nnecessary and must consider all relevant evidence and arguments presented by the parties.โ  In re\nHydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 307 (3d Cir. 2008).        \n   \nDISCUSSION\nIn deciding whether to certify the Settlement Class conditionally and in evaluating the\nproposed Settlement, I have considered, inter alia, those arguments made by the Parties before\nthey agreed to settle.  That review convinces me that conditional certification is warranted, that\nthe Settlement appears reasonable, and that the Class Notice passes legal muster.\nI.

Rule 23(a) Prerequisites\nNumerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the Class be so numerous that joinder of its members is\n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 6 of 25\nimpracticable.  โGenerally, if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of\nplaintiffs exceed 40, the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) has been met.โ  Ketchum v.\nSunoco, Inc., 217 F.R.D. 354, 357 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (citing Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220,\n227-28 (3d Cir. 2001)).  The proposed Class consists of thousands of persons.  (Doc. No. 48 at\n21.)  It is thus apparent that Plaintiffs meet Rule 23โs numerosity requirement.\nCommonality\nPlaintiffs must also demonstrate that there are questions of law or fact common to the\nClass.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  A single such issue will suffice.  Johnston v. HBO Film Mgmt.,\nInc., 265 F.3d 178, 184 (3d Cir. 2001).  Here, the Parties have identified at least two such\ncommon questions: (1) whether Defendants employ a practice or policy of strip searching all new\ndetainees admitted for misdemeanors or lessor charges without individualized reasonable\nsuspicion; and (2) whether that practice or policy is constitutional.  These issues satisfy the\ncommonality requirement.  See, e.g., In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 229-\n230 (2d Cir. 2006); Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, No. 05-\n3619, 2008 WL 800970, at *7 (D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2008) (commonality requirement satisfied where\nthe named Plaintiffs and the proposed class membersโ claims involved โthe same factual and\nlegal theoriesโ: (1) โthat they were all subjected to the same intake procedures, which they claim\ninvolve suspicionless strip searchingโ; and (2) โthat these procedures violate the Fourth\nAmendmentโ); Dodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177, 180 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (shared,\nโcentralโ issue of โthe existence or non-existence of a policy at the [defendant prison] of strip\nsearching each and every new pre-trial detainee upon arrival at the jail, regardless of the\nexistence of individualized reasonable suspicion that the new arrival was carrying contraband,\n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 7 of 25\nbased on the nature of the crime charged, the circumstances of the arrest, and the particular\ncharacteristics of the arresteeโ satisfied commonality requirement).      \nTypicality\nI must determine whether โthe named plaintiff[sโ] individual circumstances are markedly\ndifferent or . . . the legal theory upon which the claims are based differs from that upon which the\nclaims of other class members will perforce be based.โ  Johnston, 265 F.3d at 184 (quotations\nomitted).  Here, the named Plaintiffs allege that they -- along with each member of the proposed\nClass -- were strip searched pursuant to Defendantsโ blanket policy or practice.  See Baby Neal v.\nCasey, 43 F.3d 48, 58 (3d Cir. 1994) (โ[C]ases challenging the same unlawful conduct which\naffects both the named plaintiffs and the putative class usually satisfy the typicality requirement\nirrespective of the fact patterns underlying the individual claims.โ).  In these circumstances, I\nagree that the typicality requirement is met.  See, e.g., Florence, 2008 WL 800970, at *9;\nMarriott v. County of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159, 172 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (โThe claims of the\nrepresentative parties in this case, while involving a more detailed search than every member of\nthe class, still are based upon a strip search conducted pursuant [to] the Jail change-out policy.\nTherefore, the typicality requirement is met.โ), affโd, 2005 WL 3117194 (2d Cir. 2005); Sutton v.\nHopkins County, No. 03-003, 2007 WL 119892, at *4 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, 2007) (โBecause each\nnamed Plaintiff alleges an unconstitutional strip search after arrest for a minor violation or before\nrelease from Prison, the claims of the representatives are typical of the class as a whole.โ).      \nIn their Opposition to Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification, Defendants argued that\nPlaintiff Sajan Kurianโs โindividual circumstancesโ are not typical of those of the Class because:\n(1) under Pennsylvania law, reasonable suspicion was not required to strip search him because he\n7\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 8 of 25\nwas a parolee; and (2) Kurian consented to the search when, as required by Pennsylvania law, he\nsigned a document consenting to warrantless searches while on parole.  Cf. Beck v. Maximus,\nInc., 457 F.3d 291, 296 (3d Cir. 2006) (โ[U]nique defenses bear on both the typicality . . . of a\nclass representative.โ).  \nI do not believe these defenses would have been viable had this litigation continued. \nAlthough Pennsylvania law authorizes parole and probation officers to conduct a โpersonal\nsearchโ of a parolee when he or she enters or leaves a โcorrectional institution, jail, or detention\nfacility,โ Defendants have offered no authority suggesting: (1) that this law applies to intake\nofficers; or (2) that a strip search is subsumed within a โpersonal search.โ  See 61 Pa. Con. Stat.\nยงยง 331.27a(g), 331.27b(g) (defining a โpersonal searchโ as โ[a] warrantless search of an\noffenderโs person, including, but not limited to, the offenderโs clothing and any personal property\nwhich is . . . within the reach or under the control of the offenderโ); id. ยงยง 331.27a(d)(1),\n331.27b(d)(1).    \nMoreover, I do not agree that Kurian consented to being strip searched.  The Supreme\nCourt authority Defendants had relied upon related to a California statute requiring parolees to\nagree to be searched โwith or without a search warrant and with or without cause.โ  Samson v.\nCalifornia, 547 U.S. 843, 846 (2006) (citing Cal. Penal Code ยง 3067(a)); Doc. No. 35 at 29-30. \nKurianโs parole agreement included only his consent to be โsearch[ed] at any time by my\nprobation officer based upon reasonable suspicion that I am in possession of contraband.โ  Doc.\nNo. 38, Ex. 1 (emphasis supplied); see Commonwealth v. Williams, 457 Pa. 577, 588-89 (1997)\n(โ[T]he paroleeโs signing of a parole agreement . . . does not mean either that the parole officer\ncan conduct a search at any time and for any reason or that the parolee relinquishes his Fourth\n8\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 9 of 25\nAmendment Right to be free from unreasonable searches.โ). \nIn these circumstances, I believe that even though Kurian is a parolee, his claims are\ntypical of those of the Class.  Accordingly, I conclude that the typicality requirement is satisfied. \nAdequacy of Representation\nFinally, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the Class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  In evaluating this requirement, I must determine\nโwhether the representativesโ interests conflict with those of the class and whether the class\nattorney is capable of representing the class.โ  Johnston, 265 F.3d at 185; see also In re\nCommunity Bank of N. Va., 418 F.3d 277, 303 (3d Cir. 2005) (โThis requirement encompasses\ntwo distinct inquiries designed to protect the interests of absentee class members: it considers\nwhether the named plaintiffsโ interests are sufficiently aligned with the absenteesโ, and it tests the\nqualifications of the counsel to represent the class.โ) (quotations omitted).    \nNeither Party has suggested any conflict of interest between the named Plaintiffs and the\nother Class Members.  Moreover, Class Counsel -- led by David Rudovsky, the preeminent civil\nrights lawyer in this District -- are more than capable of representing the Class.  Accordingly, I\nconclude that the adequacy requirement is satisfied.      \nB. Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements \nPredominance\nIn determining predominance, I must consider \nwhether [the] proposed class[ is] sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by\nrepresentation, a standard far more demanding than the commonality requirement of\nRule 23(a), requiring more than a common claim.  Issues common to the class must\npredominate over individual issues.  Because the nature of the evidence that will\nsuffice to resolve a question determines whether the question is common or\n9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 10 of 25\nindividual, a district court must formulate some prediction as to how specific issues\nwill play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate\nin a given case.  If proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires\nindividual treatment, then class certification is unsuitable.\nIn re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d at 310-11.\nNumerous courts have found the predominance requirement satisfied in actions similar to\nthe instant matter, reasoning that the existence and constitutionality of a policy or practice of strip\nsearching all new detainees without reasonable suspicion are common issues subject to\ngeneralized proof.  See, e.g., Florence, 2008 WL 800970, at *12 (โPlaintiff challenges whether\nDefendants have a policy or practice of using intake procedures for non-indictable arrestees that\nare tantamount to suspicionless strip searches.  This issue is at the heart of each putative class\nmembersโ claim and turns on generalized, not individualized, proof.โ); Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at\n173 (โ[T]he common question is whether the change-out, strip search procedure applicable to all\nadmittees, regardless of whether reasonable suspicion exists that contraband or weapons are\npossessed, violates the Fourth Amendment.  This question does not vary among class\nmembers.โ).  \nDefendants had disputed predominance, pointing to evidence contradicting the allegation\nthat they employ a blanket strip search policy, including: (1) LCPโs Strip Search Checklists,\nwhich include questions to help the intake officer determine whether reasonable suspicion exists;\n(2) the deposition testimony of several former and current corrections officers that all new\ndetainees are not strip searched; and (3) a video demonstration of how new detainees are\nprocessed.  See Doc. No. 35, Exs. 1-10, 12-13, 19.  Defendants thus argued that whether each\nClass Member was illegally strip searched would require individualized determinations of\n10\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 11 of 25\nreasonable suspicion.  \nOther courts have rejected similar arguments, reasoning that whether a prison follows its\nown strip search policies -- or instead, employs a de facto practice of strip searching all new\ndetainees -- is a factual question that does not defeat predominance.  See, e.g., Sutton, 2007 WL\n119892, at *7 (rejecting argument that prisonโs written policy refuted the existence of a blanket\nstrip search practice and so defeated predominance; โUltimately, a reasonable jury could find that\nthe . . . Jail failed to follow its written policy, and instead followed a custom or practice to strip\nsearch all persons . . . without regard to . . . reasonable suspicion[.]โ).  Moreover, Plaintiffs have\noffered considerable evidence demonstrating the existence of a blanket practice, including: (1)\nthe deposition testimony of current and former correctional officers who could not recall โa\nsingle instanceโ where a new detainee was not strip searched; (2) new detainee Strip Search\nChecklists created during a 77 day period indicating that 32% were strip searched even though\nthe Checklists provided no basis for such action; and (3) LCPโs โContraband Trainingโ video --\ncreated in 1978 and purportedly still in use -- directing that all new detainees are to be strip\nsearched.  See Doc. No. 33 at 3-11.  \nFurther, Defendants have admitted that all new detainees must submit to a โclothing\nexchangeโ: i.e., completely undress and change into prison clothes in the presence of a\ncorrections officer.  (Doc. No. 35 at 16-17.)  At least one court has held that this practice does not\ndiffer materially from a strip search.  See Marriott, 227 F.R.D. at 169 (certifying a Rule 23(b)(3)\nclass challenging the constitutionality of a prisonโs clothing โchange-outโ policy; โThe\ndifferences . . . in the extent and purpose of the [clothing exchange] procedure do not change the\nfact that the admittees are required to strip naked in front of a [corrections officer] and submit to\n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 12 of 25\nthe observation of their body . . . .  This procedure squarely fits both the common and legal\ndefinitions of strip search.โ), affโd, 2005 WL 3117194 (2d Cir. 2005).  Accordingly, whether a\nโclothing exchangeโ is the equivalent of a โstrip search,โ and whether Defendantsโ โclothing\nexchangeโ policy comports with the Fourth Amendment are also predominant, common issues.   \nDefendants further argued that individual issues would predominate because, the\nexistence of a blanket strip search practice notwithstanding, some Class Members: (1) may have\nbeen strip searched as a result of reasonable suspicion; or (2) could have been searched as a result\nof reasonable suspicion.  See Doc. No. 35 at 39-44.  Several courts have rejected similar\nchallenges to predominance in strip search class actions.  See, e.g., In re Nassau County Strip\nSearch Cases, 461 F.3d at 229-230 (โThe class definition also implicated two broad common\nliability issues: whether the blanket policy existed and whether defendants are liable for its\nimplementation.  The only countervailing, individualized liability issue was whether, regardless\nof the policy, some plaintiffs were strip searched based upon โreasonable and contemporaneously\nheld suspicion.โ  The existence of this defense does โnot . . . foreclose class certification.โโ)\n(quoting In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 138 (2d Cir. 2001)).  The\nFirst Circuit has reasoned that\n[i]f there [is] in fact a rule, custom or policy of strip searching every arrestee or a\nsubstantially overlarge category, then it is a fair guess that most arrestees so classed\nwere strip searched on this basis.  There might yet be some number as to whom\ndefensible individual judgments to strip search were actually made or could have\nbeen made -- two different situations with different legal implications; but whoever\nhas the burden of identifying such persons, they may well not be numerous.\nTardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004).  Other courts have ruled that once\nplaintiffs establish a blanket practice of strip searching all new detainees: (1) the burden shifts to\n12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 13 of 25\nthe defendant to prove that particular class members were legally strip searched based on\nreasonable suspicion; and (2) the existence of such a defense to certain class membersโ claims\ndoes not defeat predominance.  See Sutton, 2007 WL 119892, at *4 (โCourts generally recognize\nthat if plaintiffs can establish that defendants had an unconstitutional strip search policy or\ncustom, defendants will have the burden to show that a particular search was reasonable.โ)\n(quotations omitted); Dodge, 226 F.R.D. at 182 (โ[T]he fact that a particular class member could\nhave been lawfully strip searched if [the prison] had made the constitutionally required\nassessment is a defense to a particular class memberโs claim for damages, not a defense to the\nclass-wide claim that the County searched everyone without making any assessment at all.โ);\nMack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 24 (D. Mass. 2000) (โ[T]o require Plaintiff to prove that\neach individual search was unsupportable, as well as indiscriminate, would be unnecessary and\nunfair.  Given that these [plaintiffs] were routinely strip-searched, the burden rests on Defendants\nto demonstrate that particular searches were reasonable.โ).  \nIn sum, I conclude that the predominance requirement is satisfied.\n     Superiority\nI must also consider whether a class action is superior to other forms of adjudication. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  โThe superiority requirement asks the court to balance, in terms of\nfairness and efficiency, the merits of a class action against those of alternative available methods\nof adjudication.โ  In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 316 (quotations omitted).\nIt is apparent that a class action is the superior form of adjudication.  Indeed, because\neach Class Memberโs โprovable[,] actual damagesโ are likely low, a class action is โnot only the\nsuperior means, but probably the only feasible one . . . to establish liability and perhaps\n13\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 14 of 25\ndamages.โ  Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 7 (โ[O]nly the limited number of cases where serious damage\nensued would ever be brought without class status and . . . the vast majority of claims would\nnever be brought unless aggregated because provable actual damages are too small.โ) (citations\nomitted); see also In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 229 (โAbsent class\ncertification and its attendant class-wide notice procedures, most of these individuals -- who\npotentially number in the thousands -- likely never will know that defendants violated their\nclearly established constitutional rights, and thus never will be able to vindicate those rights.  As\na practical matter, then, without use of the class action mechanism, individuals harmed by\ndefendantsโ policy and practice may lack an effective remedy altogether.โ).  \nIn sum, I conclude that Plaintiffs satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one\nrequirement of Rule 23(b).  Accordingly, I will conditionally certify a Rule 23(b)(3) class for\nsettlement purposes. \nII. Preliminary Approval of Settlement\nโThe preliminary approval decision is not a commitment to approve the final settlement;\nrather, it is a determination that there are no obvious deficiencies and the settlement falls within\nthe range of reason.โ  Gates, 248 F.R.D. at 438 (quotations omitted); see also In re Diet Drugs\nProds. Liab. Litig., No. 99-20593, 1999 WL 33644489, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 3, 1999) (โ[A]\ndistrict courtโs first step in reviewing a class action settlement proposal is . . . to determine\nwhether the proposed settlement is within the range of possible approval.โ) (quoting Armstrong\nv. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of the City of Milwaukee, 616 F.2d 305, 314 (7th Cir. 1980)); Manual for\nComplex Litigation, ยง 21.632 (4th ed. 2009).  In determining whether to approve preliminarily\n14\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 15 of 25\nthe Settlement, I must consider whether: โ(1) the negotiations occurred at armโs length; (2) there\nwas sufficient discovery; (3) the proponents of the settlement are experienced in similar\nlitigation; and (4) only a small fraction of the class objected.โ  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig.,\n292 F. Supp. 2d 631, 638 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (quoting In re Gen. Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel\nTank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 785-86 (3d Cir. 1995)).\nIt is apparent that the proposed Settlement is the result of good faith, arms-length\nnegotiations between the Parties.  Before settlement negotiations began, Class Counsel took\nextensive class discovery, including numerous interrogatories, voluminous document production,\nand many depositions and interviews.  (Doc. No. 48 at 4).  The Parties also vigorously litigated\nclass certification.  The settlement negotiations involved the mediation services of former Chief\nMagistrate Judge James R. Melinson and took several months.  Moreover, Class Counsel and\nDefense Counsel are familiar with the issues presented, having previously litigated the\nconstitutionality of prison strip search policies.  See, e.g., Martinez v. Warner, No. 07-3213 (E.D.\nPa. 2007) (David MacMain, counsel for Defendants); Boone v. City of Phil., No. 05-1851 (E.D.\nPa. 2005) (Daniel C. Levin and Christopher G. Hayes, counsel for Plaintiffs).  Finally, I am not\naware of any objectors to the proposed Settlement at this stage.  \nSignificantly, the Settlement Agreement will provide prospective relief that the named\nPlaintiffs sought in this action, but likely lacked standing to pursue.  In their Amended\nComplaint, Plaintiffs brought claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to change\npractices at LCP.  Courts have repeatedly concluded in similar circumstances that the plaintiffs\nlacked standing to seek such equitable relief because the threat that they would suffer future harm\n-- i.e., that they would again be arrested, detained at the same facility, and strip searched -- was\n15\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 16 of 25\ntoo speculative.  See, e.g., Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1308 n.27 (11th Cir. 2007); Smook\nv. Minnehaha County, 457 F.3d 806, 815-16 (8th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1317 (2007);\nShain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211, 214-216 (2004); Campbell v. Miller, 373 F.3d 834, 836 (7th Cir.\n2004); Ducharme v. R.I., 30 F.3d 126, 1994 WL 390144, at *3-4 (1st Cir. July 15, 1994)\n(unpublished); see also OโShea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974) (โ[I]f none of the named\nplaintiffs . . . establishes the requisite of a case or controversy with the defendants, none may\nseek [injunctive] relief on behalf of himself or any other member of the class.โ).       \nIn the proposed Settlement, however, Defendants have agreed to revise their strip search\npolicy and employ a new Strip Search Checklist approved by Class Counsel.  See Settlement\nAgreement ยง III.A.1.  The Parties agree that the revised policy comports with the Fourth\nAmendment; Defendants have agreed to re-train their Corrections Officers to ensure compliance. \nId. ยงยง III.A.2-3.  In addition, the Parties have agreed that Class Counsel will monitor compliance\nwith the new policy: every 90 days, Defendants will provide Class Counsel with copies of the\nintake files for all new detainees during a specified 5 day period.  Id. ยง III.A.4.  I will retain\njurisdiction during this monitoring, which will terminate 18 months after Final Approval of the\nSettlement.  Id.  If Class Counsel believes that Defendants have violated the new policy, and the\nParties cannot resolve the dispute, Class Counsel may seek relief from the Court, including\ncontempt sanctions.  Id.  The providing of significant prospective relief along with monitoring\nand sanctions again confirms that the proposed Settlement is the product of vigorous litigation\nand arms-length negotiations.\n16\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 17 of 25\nIII. Class Notice\nRule 23(e) requires that I โdirect notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who\nwould be bound by the proposal.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1).  This requirement is โdesigned to\nsummarize the litigation and the settlement and to apprise class members of the right and\nopportunity to inspect the complete settlement documents, papers, and pleadings filed in the\nlitigation.โ  In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 326-27 (quotations omitted).  \nI conclude that the plan for notifying the Class of the proposed Settlement is reasonable. \nThe Parties have agreed that Class Counsel will obtain from Defendants a last known address,\ndate of birth, and social security number (if possible) for each Class Member.  See Settlement\nAgreement ยงยง IV.B.1-4.  The Notice will be mailed to each identified individual.  Class Counsel\nwill also use print media (the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Intelligencer Journal/Lancaster New\nEra), a website, and a toll-free number to provide notice.  See id. ยง IV.B.1; Zimmer Paper Prods.,\nInc. v. Berger & Montague, P.C., 758 F.2d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 1985) (โIt is well-settled that in the\nusual situation first class mail and publication fully satisfy the notice requirements of Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23 and the due process clause.โ).  Moreover, the Class Notice and Claim Form will be\nposted in prominent locations in LCP and the Lancaster County Office of Probation and Parole. \nSee Settlement Agreement ยงยง IV.B.1; cf. Harris v. Reeves, 761 F. Supp. 383, 393 (E.D. Pa.\n1991) (approving similar notice in class action challenging prison overcrowding; โposting in the\nprisons remain[s] the best way to provide whatever notice is requiredโ).\nCONCLUSION\nIn sum, I preliminarily conclude that: (1) the requirements for maintaining a Rule\n17\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 18 of 25\n23(b)(3) class action are met; (2) the Partiesโ proposed Settlement โfalls within the range of\nreasonโ; and (3) the Class Notice is reasonable.  Gates, 248 F.R.D. at 438.  Accordingly, I will\ngrant the Partiesโ Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement and Provisional Class\nCertification, direct notice of the Settlement to the Class, and schedule a Final Approval Hearing.\n  \n18\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 53    Filed 09/01/09   Page 19 of 25\nAND NOW, this 1st day of September, 2009, it is ORDERED that the Partiesโ Joint\nโMotion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement and Provisional Class Certificationโ (Doc. No.\n46) is GRANTED as follows:\n1.        Capitalized terms used in this Order have the meanings assigned to them in the\nSettlement Agreement and this Order.\n2.        The terms of the Partiesโ Settlement Agreement are hereby conditionally approved,\nsubject to further consideration thereof at the Final Approval Hearing provided for below.  The\nCourt finds that said Settlement is sufficiently within the range of reasonableness and that notice\nof the proposed Settlement should be given as provided in this Order.\n3.

On July 28, 2009, the Parties submitted a Settlement Agreement\nfor my approval.  (Doc. No. 47.)  On September 1, 2009, I granted the Partiesโ Motion for\nPreliminary Approval of the Settlement Agreement and conditionally certified the Class.  (Doc.\nNo. 53.)  I held a hearing on March 31, 2010 to determine whether finally to approve the\nSettlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate.  For the reasons that follow, I will certify the\nSettlement Class and grant the Partiesโ Motion for Approval of Settlement and Class\nCertification (Doc. No. 61). \nI. BACKGROUND\nThe Supreme Court has held that in determining the Fourth Amendment reasonableness\nof pretrial detainee strip searches, courts must consider โthe scope of the particular intrusion, the\n1\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 2 of 20\nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.โ  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979) (upholding prisonโs policy of strip\nsearching all pretrial detainees that had contact visits with outsiders).  Applying Bell, a majority\nof Circuits have held that a pretrial detainee charged with a misdemeanor or lesser offense may\nnot be strip searched upon commitment without reasonable suspicion to believe that he or she is\nconcealing a weapon or contraband.  See Allison v. GEO Group, Inc., 611 F. Supp. 2d 433, 451-\n52 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (collecting cases); Young v. County of Cook, 616 F. Supp. 2d 834, 846 (N.D.\nIll. 2009) (โThe crux of these cases is that given the extreme intrusion into personal privacy that a\nstrip search or body cavity search entails, people charged with minor offenses that do not involve\ndrugs or weapons are not subject to such searches absent individualized reasonable suspicion.โ);\nbut see Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir. 2008) (โThe difference between\nfelonies and misdemeanors or other lesser offenses is without constitutional significance when it\ncomes to detention facility strip searches.โ).  The Third Circuit has not yet addressed this issue,\nbut has agreed to hear an interlocutory appeal involving prison strip searches of misdemeanor\noffenders.  See Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, No. 05-3619,\n2008 WL 800970 (D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2008), appeal docketed, No. 09-3603 (3d Cir. Sept. 21, 2009).\nPlaintiffs filed the instant action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1983 on August 22, 2007,\nalleging that Defendants have โinstituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of\nstrip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Lancaster County Prison and are\nplaced into Prison clothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime or violation and\nwithout the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a\nweapon or contraband.โ  (Doc. No. 1, Compl. ยถ 24.)  Plaintiffs sought money damages and\n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 3 of 20\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and asked me to certify a hybrid Rule 23(b)(2)/(b)(3) class of\nsimilarly situated persons: (1) who, commencing on August 22, 2005, have been or will be\nadmitted to LCP after being detained for misdemeanors or similar offenses โthat do not involve\nthe possession or distribution of drugs, possession of weapons, or are violent feloniesโ; and (2)\nโwho were or will be strip searched upon their entry into [LCP] pursuant to the practice, policy,\nor custom of Defendants.โ  (Doc. No. 33, Am. Compl. ยถ 11.) \n  Plaintiffs moved for Class Certification on November 11, 2007.  (Doc. No. 17.)  On\nNovember 21, 2007, I issued a Scheduling Order and allowed Plaintiffs to submit a renewed\nMotion for Class Certification following discovery.  (Doc. No. 21.)  Plaintiffs filed an Amended\nComplaint on May 15, 2008, and renewed their Motion for Class Certification on October 14,\n2008.  (Doc. Nos. 28, 32.)  Defendants filed a Response in Opposition on November 4, 2008;\nPlaintiffs filed a Reply on November 14, 2008.  (Doc. Nos. 35, 38, 39.)  Oral argument on\nPlaintiffsโ Motion was scheduled for November 24, 2008.  (Doc. No. 31.)  During a Chambers\nConference before oral argument, however, the Parties asked to suspend litigation while they\nengaged in settlement discussions.  (Doc. Nos. 42, 43.)  \nThe Parties agreed to settle this matter on March 23, 2009.  (Doc. Nos. 45, 48 at 2.)  Their\nSettlement Agreement, executed on July 28, 2009, provides for a $2,507,200 Settlement Fund,\nwith an initial contribution of $1,946,860.  See Settlement Agreement ยง III.B.1.  The amount\ndistributed to each Class Member -- ranging from $50 to $900 -- will be determined by his or her\nclassification into one of five Categories.  Id. ยง III.C.1(i).  These Categories are based on criteria\nthat include: whether the Class Member was on probation or on parole at the time of admission\nto LCP, the information disclosed on the individualโs Strip Search Checklist pertaining to the\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 4 of 20\nnature of the charge, whether the detainee has a known history of violence or drug use, and\nwhether the detainee was disruptive or threatening when he or she was admitted.  Id.; see also id.,\nEx. D.           \nII. CERTIFICATION OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS\nI preliminarily certified a Rule 23(b)(3) Class for settlement purposes in my September\n1st Order.  (Doc. No. 53.)  See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23; In re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up\nTruck Fuel Tank Prods. Liability Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 786 (3d Cir. 1995) (a settlement class is โa\ndevice whereby the court postpones the formal certification procedure until the parties have\nsuccessfully negotiated a settlement, thus allowing a defendant to explore settlement without\nconceding any of its arguments against certificationโ). \nTo be certified, a class must satisfy the four threshold requirements of Rule 23(a): (1)\nnumerosity (a โclass [so large] that joinder of all members is impracticableโ); (2) commonality\n(โquestions of law or fact common to the classโ); (3) typicality (named partiesโ claims or\ndefenses โare typical . . . of the classโ); and (4) adequacy of representation (representatives must\nโfairly and adequately protect the interests of the classโ).  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Amchem\nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997).  Where, as here, a settlement class is sought to\nbe certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the class must show that: (1) common questions โpredominate\nover any questions affecting only individual members,โ and (2) class resolution is โsuperior to\nother available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.โ  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 23(b); Amchem, 521 U.S. at 615. \nWith more than 19,000 potential members of the Settlement Class, Rule 23(a)(1)โs\nnumerosity requirement is obviously satisfied, and has never been disputed.  See Ketchum v.\n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 5 of 20\nSunoco, Inc., 217 F.R.D. 354, 357 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (citing Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220,\n227-28 (3d Cir. 2001)) (โGenerally, if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number\nof plaintiffs exceed 40, the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) has been met.โ). \nThe commonality requirement is met because the Parties have identified two questions of\nlaw or fact common to the Class: (1) whether Defendants employed a practice or policy of strip\nsearching all new detainees admitted for misdemeanors or lesser charges without individualized\nreasonable suspicion; and (2) whether that practice or policy was constitutional.  See, e.g., In re\nNassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 229-230 (2d Cir. 2006); Florence, 2008 WL\n800970 at *7 (D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2008) (commonality requirement satisfied where the named\nplaintiffs and the proposed class membersโ claims involved โthe same factual and legal theoriesโ:\n(1) โthat they were all subjected to the same intake procedures, which they claim involve\nsuspicionless strip searchingโ; and (2) โthat these procedures violate the Fourth Amendmentโ).  \nSimilarly, the Ruleโs typicality requirement is satisfied because Plaintiffs allege that they -- along\nwith each member of the proposed Class -- were strip searched pursuant to Defendantsโ blanket\npolicy or practice.  See Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 58 (3d Cir. 1994) (โ[C]ases challenging\nthe same unlawful conduct which affects both the named plaintiffs and the putative class usually\nsatisfy the typicality requirement irrespective of the fact patterns underlying the individual\nclaims.โ). \nFinally, Rule 23(a) requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate that they will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the Class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  In evaluating this requirement, I must\ndetermine โwhether the representativesโ interests conflict with those of the class and whether the\nclass attorney is capable of representing the class.โ  Johnston v. HBO Film Mgmt., Inc., 265 F.3d\n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 6 of 20\n178, 185 (3d Cir. 2001).  There is no suggestion of any conflict of interest between the named\nPlaintiffs and the other Class Members.  Class Counsel are especially talented lawyers, who are\nmore than capable of representing the Class.  Lead counsel is David Rudovsky, the preeminent\ncivil rights lawyer in this District.  Also representing the Class are lawyers who are vastly\nexperienced in class action litigation: Joseph Sauder of Chimicles & Tikellis LLP, Christopher\nG. Hayes of the Law Office of Christopher G. Hayes, and Daniel C. Levin of Levin, Fishbein,\nSedran & Berman.  Accordingly, I conclude that the adequacy requirement is satisfied. \nNumerous courts have found Rule 23(b)โs predominance requirement satisfied in actions\nsimilar to the instant matter, reasoning that the issues respecting the existence and\nconstitutionality of strip searching policies or practices are common to the class and subject to\ngeneralized proof.  See, e.g., Florence, 2008 WL 800970, at *12 (โPlaintiff challenges whether\nDefendants have a policy or practice of using intake procedures for non-indictable arrestees that\nare tantamount to suspicionless strip searches.  This issue is at the heart of each putative class\nmembersโ claim and turns on generalized, not individualized, proof.โ); Marriott v. County of\nMontgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159, 173 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (โ[T]he common question is whether the\nchange-out, strip search procedure applicable to all admittees, regardless of whether reasonable\nsuspicion exists that contraband or weapons are possessed, violates the Fourth Amendment.  This\nquestion does not vary among class members.โ).  \nDefendants had contested predominance, however, before agreeing to settle.  They\noffered evidence contradicting the suggestion that LCP employs a blanket strip search policy, and\nargued that individualized determinations of reasonable suspicion to strip search each Class\nMember would predominate.  See Doc. No. 35, Exs. 1-10, 12-13, 19.  Other courts have rejected\n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 7 of 20\nsimilar arguments, concluding that whether a prison follows its own strip search policies -- or\ninstead, employs a de facto practice of strip searching all new detainees -- is a factual question\nthat does not defeat predominance.  See, e.g., Sutton v. Hopkins County, No. 03-003, 2007 WL\n119892, at *7 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 11, 2007) (rejecting argument that prisonโs written policy refuted\nthe existence of a blanket strip search practice and so defeated predominance: โUltimately, a\nreasonable jury could find that the . . . Jail failed to follow its written policy, and instead\nfollowed a custom or practice to strip search all persons . . . without regard to . . . reasonable\nsuspicion[.]โ).  Moreover, Plaintiffs offered considerable evidence establishing the existence of a\nblanket practice, including the deposition testimony of current and former correctional officers\nwho could not recall โa single instanceโ where a new detainee was not strip searched.  See Doc.\nNo. 33 at 3-11.  Courts have also ruled that once plaintiffs offer evidence of a blanket practice of\nstrip searching all new detainees: (1) the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that particular\nclass members were legally strip searched based on reasonable suspicion; and (2) the existence of\nsuch a defense to certain class membersโ claims does not defeat predominance.   See, e.g., Mack\nv. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 24 (D. Mass. 2000) (โ[T]o require Plaintiff to prove that each\nindividual search was unsupportable, as well as indiscriminate, would be unnecessary and unfair. \nGiven that these [plaintiffs] were routinely strip searched, the burden rests on Defendants to\ndemonstrate that particular searches were reasonable.โ).  In sum, I conclude that the\npredominance requirement is satisfied.\nIt is also apparent that a class action is the superior form of adjudication.  In fact, because\neach Class Memberโs โprovable[,] actual damagesโ are not likely to be substantial, a class action\nis โnot only the superior means, but probably the only feasible one . . . to establish liability and\n7\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 8 of 20\nperhaps damages.โ  Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (โ[O]nly the limited\nnumber of cases where serious damage ensued would ever be brought without class status and . .\n. the vast majority of claims would never be brought unless aggregated because provable actual\ndamages are too small.โ) (citations omitted); see also In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases,\n461 F.3d at 229 (โAbsent class certification and its attendant class-wide notice procedures, most\nof these individuals -- who potentially number in the thousands -- likely never will know that\ndefendants violated their clearly established constitutional rights, and thus never will be able to\nvindicate those rights.  As a practical matter, then, without use of the class action mechanism,\nindividuals harmed by defendantsโ policy and practice may lack an effective remedy\naltogether.โ).  Accordingly, because Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a) and\n(b), I will certify a Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class. \nIII. APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT\nI may approve a class action settlement under Rule 23 where, as here, it is โfair,\nreasonable and adequate.โ  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1)(c); In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales\nPractices Litig., 148 F.3d 283, 316 (3d Cir. 1998); Stoetzner v. U.S. Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115,\n118 (3d Cir. 1990); Walsh v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., Inc., 726 F.2d 956, 965 (3d Cir.\n1983).  I have broad discretion in making this decision.  Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d\nCir. 1975).\nCourts in this Circuit give considerable weight and deference to the views of experienced\ncounsel as to the merits of an arms-length settlement.  In re Automotive Refinishing Paint\nAntitrust Litig., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29161, at *6 (E.D. Pa. September 27, 2004); see also\nPetruzziโs, Inc. v. Darling-Delaware Co., 880 F. Supp. 292, 301 (M.D. Pa. 1995) (โ[T]he\n8\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 9 of 20\nopinions and recommendations of โฆ experienced counsel are โฆ entitled to considerable\nweight.โ); Lake v. First Nationwide Bank, 156 F.R.D. 615, 628 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (giving โdue\nregard to the recommendations of the experienced counsel in this case, who have negotiated this\nsettlement at arms-length and in good faithโ).  โA presumption of correctness is said to attach to\na class settlement reached in arms-length negotiations between experienced, capable counsel\nafter meaningful discovery.โ  In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 292 F. Supp. 2d 631, 640 (E.D.\nPa. 2003).\nIn Girsh v. Jepson, the Third Circuit Court identified nine factors to assist courts in\ndetermining whether a class action settlement should be approved as โfair, adequate and\nreasonable.โ  521 F.2d at 157.  These โGirsh factorsโ are:\n(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation;\n(2) the reaction of the class to the settlement;\n(3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed;\n(4) the risks of establishing liability;\n(5) the risks of establishing damages;\n(6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial;\n(7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment;\n(8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible\nrecovery; and\n(9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of all the attendant\nrisks of litigation.\nIn re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 232 (3d Cir. 2001).  Applying these factors here, I\nconclude that the proposed Settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.\nThe complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation support final approval of\nthe Settlement.  This matter has been pending since August 2007, and Class Counsel have\nalready recorded 2,381 hours working on the case and incurred out-of-pocket costs of\n$40,867.87.  (Doc. No. 59 at 19.)  Moreover, the outcome of trial or dispositive motions is by no\n9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 10 of 20\nmeans certain, particularly because the Third Circuit could at any time issue a ruling on the\nconstitutional questions presented here.  See Florence, No. 05-3619 (D.N.J), appeal docketed,\nNo. 09-3603, (3d Cir. Sept. 21, 2009).  Although the weight of authority suggests that a blanket\npolicy of strip searches is unconstitutional, the Eleventh Circuit, and more recently, the Ninth\nCircuit, have held that pretrial detainees could be strip searched even in the absence of\nreasonable suspicion.  See Powell, 541 F.3d at 1310; Bull v. City & County of San Francisco,\n595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc).  In these circumstances, Settlement at this time is in the\nClassโ best interest because it affords certain relief.\nThe reaction of the Class to the Settlement also weighs in favor of final approval. \nPursuant to my September 1st Order, the Parties mailed individual notices to more than 19,000\npotential Class Members and posted notices in newspapers, on the Internet, and at Lancaster\nCounty Prison.  (Doc. No. 59 at 21-22.)  In response, 2,047 Class Members have submitted claim\nforms, and nine Class Members have opted out of the Settlement.  Only one person objected,\nalthough he did not claim to be a Class Member, nor did he raise any concerns respecting the\nfairness of the Settlement or the allocation of the Settlement funds.  (Id.)  Accordingly, the Classโ\nreaction to the Settlement has been overwhelmingly favorable.\nThe stage of proceedings and the amount of discovery completed also supports approval\nof the Settlement.  It is apparent that the Settlement is the result of good faith, arms-length\nnegotiations.  Before negotiations began, Class Counsel took extensive discovery, propounding\ninterrogatories and document requests, and conducting depositions and interviews.  (Doc. No. 48\nat 4.)  The Third Circuit has held that settlements made after discovery typically reflect the true\nvalue of the claim.  See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1314 (3d Cir. 1993).  \n10\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 11 of 20\nThe Parties also vigorously litigated class certification.  The settlement negotiations\ninvolved the mediation services of former Chief Magistrate Judge James R. Melinson and took\nseveral months.  Moreover, Class Counsel and Defense Counsel are familiar with the issues\npresented, having previously litigated the constitutionality of prison strip search policies.  See,\ne.g., Martinez v. Warner, No. 07-3213 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (David MacMain, counsel for\nDefendants); Boone v. City of Phila., 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 712 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (Daniel C. Levin\nand Christopher G. Hayes, counsel for Plaintiffs).  \nThe risks of being unable to establish liability and damages and maintain the class action\nthrough trial โ the fourth, fifth, and sixth Girsh factors โ appear to support approval of the\nSettlement.  As discussed earlier, a Third Circuit ruling could dramatically affect the liability\nquestions presented.  Moreover, the Third Circuit has held that a district court has the authority to\ndecertify a class action.  See In re Automotive Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation, 617 F.\nSupp. 2d 336, 344 (E.D. Pa. 2007).  In any event, the case could proceed to trial, followed by\nyears of appellate litigation.  These factors thus weigh in favor of the Settlement.\n Although Lancaster County could likely withstand a greater judgment, this is not certain. \nSee, e.g., Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 712 (โTaking into consideration the current financial\nsituation of the City, however, the plaintiffs do have cause to be genuinely concerned about the\nability of the defendant to allocate its resources to a greater judgment.โ)  In any event, courts in\nthis Circuit have held that this Girsh factor is not especially significant in assessing a proposed\nsettlement.  See Meijer, Inc. v. 3M, 2006 WL 2382718, at *16 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 14, 2006) (the\ndetermination, standing alone, that a defendant could withstand a greater judgment โdoes not\ncarry much weight in evaluating the fairness of the Settlementโ) (citing Perry v. FleetBoston Fin.\n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 12 of 20\nCorp., 229 F.R.D. 105, 116 (E.D. Pa. 2005)). \nThe value of the Settlement in light of the Class Membersโ damages and the risks of\nlitigation also weighs in favor of the Settlement.  Each Class Member will receive between $50\nand $900, an amount comparable to the awards in other strip search cases.  See McBean v. City\nof New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 388 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).  Significantly, the Settlement Agreement\nwill also provide the prospective relief that named Plaintiffs sought here, but likely lacked\nstanding to pursue.  See, e.g., Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288, 1308 n.27 (11th Cir. 2007). \nDefendants have agreed to revise their Strip Search Policy and employ a new Strip Search\nChecklist approved by Class Counsel.  See Settlement Agreement ยง III.A.1.  The Parties agree\nthat the revised policy comports with the Fourth Amendment, and Defendants have agreed to re-\ntrain their Corrections Officers to ensure compliance.  Id. ยงยง III.A.2-3.  This significant\nprospective relief, coupled with damages for the individual Class Members, confirms that the\nproposed Settlement is the product of vigorous litigation and arms-length negotiations.\nConsidering all the benefits obtained for the Class and the difficulties litigation would\npresent, I conclude that the Settlement is reasonable.  Accordingly, the Girsh factors support the\nsettlement.\nI must also determine the reasonableness of the Settlementโs allocation plan.  See In re\nIkon Office Solutions, Inc., 194 F.R.D. 166, 184 (E.D. Pa. 2000).  โApproval of a plan of\nallocation of a settlement fund in a class action is โgoverned by the same standards of review\napplicable to approval of the settlement as a whole: the distribution plan must be fair, reasonable\nand adequate.โโ  Id. (quoting In re Computron Software, Inc., 6 F. Supp. 2d 313, 321 (D.N.J.\n1998))  โAs with other aspects of settlement, the opinion of experienced and informed counsel is\n12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 13 of 20\nentitled to considerable weight.โ  In re American Bank Note Holographics, Inc., 127 F. Supp. 2d\n418, 430 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, Class Members are divided into five Categories.  See\nSettlement Agreement ยง III.C.1.i.  Category I includes Class Members who were not on parole or\nprobation at the time of their admission to Lancaster County Prison and whose Strip Search\nChecklists are checked or signed on the line next to โThis Prisoner has been Searched by Me.โ \nThese Class Members will receive no more than $900.  Category II includes Class Members who\nwere not on parole or probation, but whose Strip Search Checklists are checked or signed on the\nline next to โThis Prisoner has Not been Searched by Me.โ  These Class Members will receive no\nmore than $500.  Category III includes Class Members who were on probation or parole whose\nChecklists indicate they were searched.  They will receive nor more than $400.  Category IV\nincludes Class Members who were on probation or parole whose Settlements indicate they were\nnot searched.  They will receive no more than $200.  Category V includes Class Members who\ndo not fit into any other Category, but contend they were strip searched upon admission to the\nprison.  They will receive no more than $50.  \nThese Categories appear to correspond to Defendantsโ potential defenses against\nindividual claims.  Defendants had argued in their Opposition to Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class\nCertification that Pennsylvania law did not require reasonable suspicion to strip search prisoners\non parole.  (Doc. No. 35.)  Accordingly, because the Parties propose to pay the most to those\nClass Members with the strongest claims, the allocation plan โ like the rest of the Settlement โ\nappears to be fair, reasonable, and adequate.\n13\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 14 of 20\nIV. ATTORNEYSโ FEES AND OTHER COSTS\nClass Counsel have requested attorneysโ fees of $750,000 โ 29.91 percent of the $2.5\nmillion Settlement Fund.  (Doc. No. 61 at 1.)  Counsel also requests reimbursement of $35,000\nfor out-of-pocket expenses, and $22,500 in incentive awards to the named Plaintiffs.  (Id.)  The\nSettlement Agreement explicitly allows Class Counsel to petition for these sums.  See Settlement\nAgreement ยง III.B.3.\n  Class Counsel who recover a common fund are entitled to a fair and reasonable award of\nattorneysโ fees from the fund.  Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U.S. 472, 478 (1980).  Here,\nClass Counsel calculate their fee award using the percentage-of-recovery method which is\nfavored in common fund cases.  See In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 819.  They also use the the\nlodestar method as a cross-check to ensure that the proposed fee is reasonable.  See, e.g., In re\nInsurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d 241 (3d Cir. 2009).\nWhere, as here, the percentage-of-recovery method is used to determine attorneysโ fees in\na common fund case, the Third Circuit requires district courts to consider seven factors for\ndetermining the reasonableness of the fee.  Gunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp., 223 F.3d 190 (3d\nCir. 2000). These are: \n(1) the size of the fund created and the number of persons benefitted;\n(2) the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the\nsettlement terms and/or fees requested by counsel;\n(3) the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved;\n(4) the complexity and duration of the litigation;\n(5) the risk of nonpayment;\n(6) the amount of time devoted to the case by Plaintiffsโ counsel; and\n(7) the awards in similar cases.\nGunter, 223 F.3d at 195 n.1.  All factors weigh in favor of approving the attorneysโ fee petition in\n14\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 15 of 20\nthis case.\nThe size of the fund created and number of persons benefitted favors the fee amount, as\nClass Counsel were able to obtain $2.5 million for a potential Class of some 19,000 individuals.\nThe number of substantial objections also weighs in Class Counselsโ favor.  Only one\nperson objected, and he did not raise any concerns respecting the proposed attorneysโ fees or the\nincentive payments to the named Plaintiffs.  (Doc. No. 59 at 22.)\nThe third factor โ the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved โ  supports approval of\nthe attorneysโ fee request.  As I have discussed,  Class Counsel are highly skilled and have\nobtained significant prospective relief in addition to cash awards.\nThe fourth and fifth factors โ the complexity and duration of the litigation and the risk of\nnonpayment โ also support approval of Class Counselsโ request.  As I have discussed, this case\ninvolves complicated โ and increasingly uncertain โ  issues of constitutional law.  Given the\nnearly three years Counsel have spent litigating this matter, the fee requested is entirely\nreasonable.\nThe sixth factor โ the amount of time devoted by counsel โ supports the fee amount.\nClass Counsel document 2,381 hours of contingent work on this litigation, justifying the amount\nrequested in their petition.  (Doc. No. 61 at 11.)\nThe last Gunter factor โ the awards granted in similar cases โ supports the fee request as\nwell.  The nearly 30 percent fee requested by Class Counsel is within the range of requests\ngranted in other strip search cases.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 714.  Accordingly, under the\nGunter factors, attorneysโ fees of slightly less than 30 percent are reasonable. \nThe Third Circuit instructs district courts to conduct a โcross-checkโ of a fee award using\n15\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 16 of 20\nthe lodestar method โto insure that plaintiffsโ lawyers are not receiving an excessive fee at their\nclientsโ expense.โ  Gunter, 223 F.3d at 199.  A court determines the lodestar by multiplying the\nnumber of hours counsel reasonably worked on a clientโs case by a reasonable hourly billing rate\nfor such services in a given geographical area provided by a lawyer of comparable experience. \nId.  Class Counsel worked 2,381 hours at rates ranging from $407 to $550 an hour.  (Doc. No. 61\nat 12-13, Ex. 1-4.)  Thus, their total lodestar is $1.11 million, significantly higher than the\n$750,000 they have requested.  \nCourts overseeing complex class actions have found that a multiplier of one to four of a\ncounselโs lodestar is fair and reasonable.  In re Prudential, 148 F.3d 283, 341 (3d Cir. 1998). \nHere, Class Counselโs request is less than a multiplier of one of their lodestar, and therefore\nconfirms the reasonableness of their request.  See In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579\nF.3d at 284-85 (โThe lodestar multiplier that the District Court calculated was less than one and\nthus reveals the Class Counselโs fee request constitutes only a fraction of the work they billed . . .\nwe are satisfied that in the present case the District Courtโs lodestar cross-check confirmed the\nreasonableness of the fee request.โ)    \nClass Counsel have also requested reimbursement of $35,000 in costs, out of a total of\n$40,867.87 in out-of-pocket litigation expenses.  A district court may exercise its equity power to\naward reimbursement of litigation costs from a common fund.  Sprague v. Ticonic, 307 U.S. 161,\n166-67 (1939).  Class Counsel explain that these expenses were incurred for photocopying,\ndeposition transcripts, experts, filing fees, postage, and computer research.  (Doc. No. 61, Ex. 1-\n4.)   Because these totals are reasonable for a large, complex case spanning several years, Class\nCounselโs request is granted.   \n16\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 17 of 20\nFinally, Class Counsel requests $22,500 in incentive awards for the Class\nRepresentatives: $15,000 to named Plaintiff Sajan Kurian and $7,500 to Michael Rhodes.  A\ndistrict court may award named plaintiffs a modest sum in recognition of their services.  See,\ne.g., Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 715 (approving $15,000 payment to each Class Representative in\na strip search case, and noting that โthese awards, though high, are justified by the benefit\nprovided to the absent Class Members.  The class representatives have accepted the public\nexposure of the fact that they have been placed into custody and charged with a crime.โ).  Kurian\nand Rhodes initiated the litigation, were deposed, and participated in conferences and meetings\nwith Class Counsel.  (Doc. No. 61 at 15.)  Accordingly, these payments are approved.\nIn these circumstances, Class Counselโs requests for fees, costs, and incentive awards โ\nlike the Settlement Agreement as a whole โ is approved as reasonable. \nAND NOW, this 9th day of April, 2010, upon consideration of the Partiesโ Joint Motion\nfor Approval of Settlement and Class Certification (Doc. No. 59), their Motion for Attorney Fees\nand Expenses (Doc. No. 61), and all related filings, it is hereby ORDERED as folows:  \n1. A Class is CERTIFIED pursuant to Rule 23(e) consisting of:\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the\nLancaster County Prison after being detained for misdemeanors,\nsummary offenses, traffic infractions, civil commitments, bench\nwarrants, violations of probation, parol or Accelerated\nRehabilitative Disposition, and/or for other similar charges and/or\ncrimes that do not involve the possession or distribution of drugs,\npossession of weapons, or are violent felonies, and who were or\nwill be strip searched upon their entry into the Lancaster County\nPrison pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the\nDefendants.  The Class Period commences on August 22, 2005 and\nextends to July 28, 2009.  Specifically excluded from the Class are\nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal\nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.\n17\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 18 of 20\nThe Class is certified solely for purposes of this settlement.\n2. I find that Class Representatives Sajan Kurian and Michael Rhodes will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the Class.  Class Counselโs request for $22,500 in\nincentive awards (Doc. No. 61) for these Class Members is APPROVED.\n3. Pursuant to Rule 23(g), the following attorneys are appointed as Class Counsel:\nDavid Rudovsky (I.D. No. 15168)\nJonathan H. Feinberg (I.D.

No. 61) is GRANTED. \n4. The Class has received notice in the manner approved by the Court in its Order of\nSeptember 1, 2009. (Doc. No. 53.)  The Court finds that such notices: (1) constitute\nreasonable and the best practicable notice; (2) constitute notice that is reasonably\ncalculated, under the circumstances, to apprise Class Members of the terms of the\nSettlement, Class Membersโ right to object to the Settlement, and Class Membersโ right\nto appear at the Settlement fairness hearing; (3) constitute due, adequate, and sufficient\nnotice to all persons entitled to receive notice; and (4) meet the requirements of due\nprocess and Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n5. I find that arms-length negotiations have taken place in good faith between Class Counsel\ncounsel for Defendants, resulting in the Settlement Agreement filed on July 28, 2009.\nThat Agreement is adopted and made a part of this Order.  (Doc.  No. 47.)\n6. Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and after a duly-noticed final\nfairness hearing held on March 31, 2009,  I will GRANT the Parties Motion for Final\nApproval of the Proposed Settlement (Doc. No. 59).  I find that the Settlement and the\nSettlement Agreement are, in all respects, fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the best\ninterests of the Class.  The Parties are directed to implement the Settlement according to\nthe terms and provisions of the Settlement Agreement. \n7. This action and all claims against Defendants are hereby dismissed with prejudice, but I\nwill retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction of this matter, all Parties, and Settlement\nClass Members, to interpret and enforce the terms, conditions, and obligations of the\nSettlement Agreement.  I will also retain jurisdiction to ensure that Defendants comply\n19\n\nCase 2:07-cv-03482-PD   Document 68    Filed 04/09/10   Page 20 of 20\nwith their revised Strip Search Policy, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement.\n8. All Class Members who have not timely filed an opt-out request are barred and enjoined\nfrom prosecuting any claim or action related to strip searches against Defendants in any\nforum, as provided in the Settlement Agreement.\n9. The Clerk of Court shall mark this case closed.\nAND IT IS SO ORDERED.\n/s/ Paul S. Diamond\n_________________________\nPaul S. Diamond, J.\n20",
