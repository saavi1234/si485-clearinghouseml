    "summary": "<p>On November 28, 2007, five arrestees, proceeding through private counsel, filed a 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey in order to challenge the blanket strip search policy of the Ocean County Correctional Facility. The named plaintiffs alleged that they were all arrested for misdemeanor or petty crimes and, upon their admission to the jail, were strip searched pursuant to the unconstitutional blanket policy of strip searching every pre-trial detainee that entered the Jail, regardless of the crime charged and without making a determination whether there was a reasonable suspicion that the detainee possessed weapons or contraband. Plaintiffs alleged that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and sought monetary and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. Defendants answered Plaintiffs' complaint by generally denying the charges.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Court Judge Freda L. Wolfson and Magistrate Judge Tonianne J. Bongiovanni.</p>\r\n<p>On October 18, 2008, Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify class, and the court certified the class on June 9, 2009. In the order certifying the class, the court narrowed the class period to November 28, 2005 through December 28, 2007 because Defendants have adopted a new policy requiring the Ocean County Jail to install the curtain in the clothing exchange room in November 2007. For the same reason, Plaintiff had agreed before this order that they no longer seek injunctive relief and filed the third amended complaint reflecting it on June 29, 2009.</p>\r\n<p>On August 18, 2009, Defendants filed a motion to stay pending a decision from the Third Circuit in the unrelated matter of <a href=\"../../../../case/11854/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, et al</a>., Civ. Action No. 05-3619 (&ldquo;Florence case&rdquo;), another case regarding strip searches in New Jersey. This motion was granted on November 16, 2009.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 7, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay and amend the complaint, which was granted on March 13, 2014. Plaintiffs then filed the fourth amended complaint on March 25, 2014. In the fourth amended complaint, Plaintiffs pointed out that despite the Florence case, which allowed correctional officials to conduct strip searches, it remains unconstitutional to strip search minor offenders yet to be seen by a judge to determine their continuing detention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 15, 2015, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On May 16, 2017, the court granted the Defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment. The court dismissed the Plaintiffs&rsquo; Fourth Amendment claim, stating that the facts here are &ldquo;strikingly similar to the facts&rdquo; in the Florence case, which upheld the constitutionality of strip searches for individuals entering a jail's general population, regardless of the reason of detention or the existence of reasonable suspicion. The court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs&rsquo; state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice.</p>\r\n<p>The case was closed.</p>",

Plaintiffs assert that such routine, suspicionless strip searches violated their rights under \nthe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as the New Jersey Constitution \nand the New Jersey Strip Search Statute.  The defendants named are the Ocean County, the \nOcean County Department of Corrections, Theodore J. Hutler, Jr. (“Hutler”), the Warden of the \n  1 \n\nOcean County Jail, and Sandra Mueller (“Mueller”), the Chief of Corrections of the Ocean \nCounty Jail (collectively “Defendants”).   \nPresently before the Court is Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56, and Plaintiffs’ cross-motion to appoint Carol Poplar, Esq. as co-class counsel.  \nFor the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs’ unopposed cross-motion to appoint co-counsel is \nGRANTED, and Carl Poplar is hereby approved as co-class counsel nunc pro tunc to November \n6, 2013, the date on which Mr. Poplar entered his appearance on behalf of Plaintiffs.  \nAdditionally, Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, and Plaintiffs’ Fourth \nAmendment claim in Count One is hereby dismissed.  This Court declines to exercise \nsupplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ remaining state law claims in Counts One and Two.  \nTherefore, those claims are dismissed without prejudice and the applicable statutes of limitations \nare tolled, and Plaintiffs may re-file their state law claims in State court within thirty (30) days \nfrom the date of the Order accompanying this Opinion.  See 28 U.S.C.S. § 1367(c)-(d). \nI.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  A.  Testimony of Plaintiff Wedding   \nIn August 2007, a police officer pulled Wedding over for a moving violation.  See \nDeclaration of William A. Riback, Esq. (“Riback Decl.”), Ex. A, Deposition of April Wedding \n(“Wedding Dep.”) at 5:21-22, 6:14-18.  During the traffic stop, the police officer informed \nWedding that she had an outstanding warrant for failure to pay a traffic fine of $431.  Id. at 8:4-\n20, 12:18-23.  Based on that warrant, the officer proceeded to arrest Wedding and transport her \nto the Ocean County Jail.  Id. at 5:14-6:13, 14:23-15:25.  After arriving at the detection center, \nWedding was escorted to the booking desk where she provided an officer with her personal \n  2 \n\ninformation.  Id. at 14:23-15:25.  When she informed the booking officer that she could not make \nbail, Wedding testified that she was detained and strip searched.  Id. at 22:12-14.   \nWith respect to that search, a female officer escorted Wedding to the shower room, \nlocated adjacent to the booking desk, and partially closed the curtain separating the two rooms.  \nId. at 16:25-17:16, 18:9-10.  The officer directed Wedding to remove her jewelry, including her \nlip ring and tongue ring, and all of her clothes.  Id. at 18:17-19:6-23.  From about three feet \naway, the officer inspected Wedding’s clothes, and then instructed Wedding to lift her breast and \nturn around, bend over, squat and cough.  Id. at 19:17-20:19, 21:1-2.  In addition, the officer also \nvisually inspected Wedding’s mouth.  Id. at 19:15-19.  During the search, which lasted about five \nminutes, Wedding testified that she was never physically touched by the officer.  Id. at 21:3-12, \n23:12-16.  After the search, the officer gave Wedding back her own underwear and a prison \nuniform to wear.  Id. at 23:17-24:1.  Wedding was held at the Ocean Jail for two days.  Id. at \n27:21-28:9.  Although she was initially placed in a holding cell, Wedding was transferred to \ngeneral population before her mother posted bail.  Id. at 29:2-22, 30:5-31:23.   \n  B.  Testimony of Plaintiff Wright \nIn October 2007, Wright turned himself into the Toms River Police Department on a \nwarrant for failure to pay child support in the amount of $5,129.58.  See Riback Decl., Ex. B, \nDeposition of Richard Wright (“Wright Dep.”) at 6:18-19, 7:8-11, 8:4-10.  Wright was taken to \nthe Ocean County Jail, where he was escorted through the basement entrance to the booking \narea.  Id. at 8:21-23, 9:23-10:12.  There, Wright provided his personal information to the booking \nofficer, and allegedly told the officer that he was planning on posting bail.  Id. at 10:24-11:14.  \nNevertheless, Wright testified that he was not permitted to make a phone call until after he was \n“changed.”  Id. at 12:20-25.  A male officer brought Wright to “the changing room,” which was \n  3 \n\nadjacent to the booking area and contained a shower and a sink area.  Id. at 13:3-20, 16:12-14.  \nAlthough the doorway to the changing room had a curtain on it, Wright testified that the curtain \nremained open during his entire changing and search process.  Id. at 13:21-14:3.   \nDuring the strip search, the officer directed Wright to remove all of his clothes, including \nhis underwear, and the officer proceeded to visually inspect Wright’s clothes.  Id. at 14:6-18.  As \ndirected, Wright opened his mouth, and lifted his tongue.  Id. at 15:17-22.  Wright testified that \nthe officer then instructed him to “lift [his] scrotum sacs” and “turn around, put [his] hands on \nthe wall and then [he] was told to lift [his] feet in the air, one at a time and then [he] was told to \nspread [his] buttocks.”  Id. at 16:2-20.  While it does not appear that the officer ever touched \nWright, he remained in close proximity to Wright throughout the inspection.  Id. at 15:21-16:1.  \nWhen the search was completed, Wright was permitted to put on a prison uniform and slippers.  \nId. at 17:14-22.  Wright then called his girlfriend, who brought the money to the child support \ncollection office in Toms River the same day.   Id. at 11:15-12:10, 19:18-20:4.  Approximately \ntwelve hours after Wright was arrested, he made bail and was released.  Id. at 20:22-21:8.  \nWright was never transferred to the general population.  \nC.  Testimony of Plaintiff Bizzarro \nIn September 2007, pursuant to a warrant, several Ocean County sheriff’s officers \narrested Bizzarro at his home for failure to pay child support.  See Riback Decl., Ex. E, \nDeposition of Edward Bizzarro (“Bizzarro Dep.”) at 10:20-11:7, 29:2-12, 30:8-10.  After \narriving at the Ocean County Jail, Bizzarro was taken to the booking area where he waited for \nabout thirty minutes.  Id. at 16:13-17:6, 18:11-23.  Bizzarro testified that, before he provided his \npersonal information to the booking officer, he was taken to the changing room.  Id. at 18:24-\n19:11.  According to Bizzarro, the changing room was separated from the booking area with a \n  4 \n\ncurtain.  Id. at 20:2-17.  An officer directed Bizzarro to stand against the wall and remove all of \nhis clothes.  Id. at 20:21-21:11.   \nThe officer allegedly instructed Bizzarro to lift his genitals, and then to bend down, \nspread his butt cheeks and cough so the officer could check his “anal area” and “look up his \nrectum.”  Id. at 20:21-21:11, 22:6-10, 23:9-12.  Next, the officer instructed Bizzarro to lift his \nfeet and open his mouth.  Id. at 22:11-19, 23:6-7.  Throughout the strip search, the officer stood \napproximately four feet away from Bizzarro.  Id. at 21:25-22:5.  After the officer completed his \ninspection, he gave Bizzarro back his underwear and provided him with a prison uniform and a \npair of flip-flops to wear.  Id. at 24:2-12.  Bizzarro again waited on the bench to be photographed \nbefore he was taken to a crowded holding cell.  Id. at 26:18-28:2.  Ultimately, Bizzarro was \nmoved to general population where he was held for a week before he was released on bail.  Id. at \n26:32:7-16, 28:3-8. \n  D.  Ocean County Jail Policies and Procedures \nSection 9.03 of the Ocean County Department of Corrections Policies and Procedures \n(the “Policy”), effective from November 2005 through December 2007, contained the Ocean \nCounty Jail’s inmate searching procedures.1  See Riback Decl., Ex. F, the Policy at § 9.03.  \nSpecifically, the purpose of the Policy “[was] to establish the guidelines and procedure used to \nsearch inmates conscientiously, efficiently, and as often as deemed necessary to ensure the safety \nand security of the facility.”  Id.  The Policy stated that strip searches are necessary to prevent \ncontraband from entering the facility, and “[a]ll inmates admitted… shall be thoroughly \nsearched.”  Id. at § 9.03.01.   \n                                                 \n1 It is undisputed that the Policy was subsequently amended in 2008.  \n  5 \n\nUnder the section for strip searches, the Policy stated that “[t]he human body can serve as \na potential hiding place for contraband,” and “it may become necessary to strip search an inmate \nat various times.”  Id. at § 9.03.03(A).  However, the Policy distinguished between persons \ndetained for indictable and non-indictable offenses.  Id.  With respect to persons detained for \nnon-indictable offenses, the Policy provided that “[a] person who has been detained or arrested \nfor [the] commission of an offense other than a crime and who is confined in this facility shall \nnot be subject to a strip search unless there is reasonable suspicion that a weapon, controlled \ndangerous substance, or contraband will be found.”2  Id. at § 9.03.04(A).  Although the Policy \ndistinguished between persons detained for indictable and non-indictable offenses, it further \nstated that strip searches may be conducted “[p]rior to admitting a person lawfully confined to \nthe facility by court order or pursuant to an arrest authorized by law.”  Id. at § 9.03.05(B)(1).   \nLieutenant Anthony Spina (“Lt. Spina”),3 who supervised the booking and classification \nof inmates entering the Ocean County Jail, testified that there was no description or instruction \non how to perform a strip search in the Policy, and that there had been no formal training, nor \noutlines or programs in place to train the officers about the requirements of these searches.  See \nRiback Decl., Ex. G, Deposition of Lt. Spina (“Lt. Spina Dep.”) at 100:6-23, 235:7-236:16.  \nRather, the officers were taught to perform strip searches at the “corrections academy.”  Id. at \n100:20-101:15.  According to Lt. Spina, a strip search was considered “[a] thorough search of an \n                                                 \n2 The Policy expressly referenced the New Jersey Administrative Code, which provides that “[a] \nperson who has been detained or arrested for [the] commission of an offense other than a crime \nand who is confined in an adult correctional facility shall not be subject to a strip search unless” \nthere is “a reasonable suspicion that a weapon, controlled dangerous substance or contraband \nwill be found.”  N.J.A.C. § 10A:31-8.4(a). \n \n3 Lt. Spina testified, in this case, as a representative of Ocean County in accordance with Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 30(b)(6).   \n  6 \n\nunclothed person including an inspection of the genitals and anal areas and really a systematic \nsearch.”  Id. at 98:24-99:6.   \nIn regard to the intake procedure during the class period, Lt. Spina testified that a newly \nadmitted inmate was “escorted up to the booking desk by a police officer and their paperwork \n[was] presented to one of the booking officers….”  Id. at 76:15-18.  That officer first determined \nwhether the inmate was mentally fit for incarceration.  Id. at 76:20-77:2.  If so, the officer would \npat down the inmate, remove any physical restraints and begin to process that person.  Id.  \nAccording to Lt. Spina, the inmate was then asked whether he or she can post bail.  Id. at 77:3-\n17.  “[I]f the person was not going to bail out then they would be brought back to our changing \narea where their clothing would be taken and they would be issued a jail jump suit and then \nissued bedding.  Their property would be checked in and inventoried… and then they would be \nput in our… holding cell in that area where the prisoners that are waiting to be housed \nupstairs….”  Id.   \nRelevant here is the process known as “changing the inmate.”  Id. at 150:24-151:17.  Lt. \nSpina described the place where the inmates were searched as a changing area with a bench seat \non the wall to the left and two showers on the right.  Id. at 97:2-21.  This area was separated from \nthe property room and the booking desk by a curtain.  Id.  Lt. Spina acknowledged that all \npretrial detainees were required to completely remove all of their clothing, including underwear, \nwhile an officer had an opportunity to visually observe them.  Id. at 152:1-153:1.  Specifically, \nan inmate was instructed to manipulate their genitals, bend down and spread their butt cheeks \nand cough.  Id. at 99:7-100:5, 123:12-24.  Lt. Spina testified that these searches were performed \nwithout consideration of the inmate’s charge, prior institutional or criminal history or whether \n  7 \n\nthere was any reason to believe that the inmate was concealing contraband.  Id. at 150:24-151:17, \n152:1-153:1. \nAccording to Sergeant Lori Ann Martin (“Sgt. Martin”),4 an officer at the Ocean County \nJail during the class period, the inmate changing and searches were performed before the inmate \nwas “medically screened, [as well as] interviewed by classification personnel.”  Riback Decl., \nEx. H, Deposition of Sgt. Martin (“Sgt. Martin Dep.”) at 42:22-43:3.  After the medical \nexamination was completed, Sgt. Martin testified that the officers would assess the potential risk \nof an inmate to the security of the facility based on several factors, including the severity of the \noffense committed and prior criminal history.  Id. at 65:7-15, 78:21-79:1.  While classification \nwas generally done in the morning, that process often continued into the late afternoon.  Id. at \n62:12-20.  Once the classification determination was made, the inmate was introduced into the \ngeneral population of the Ocean County Jail.  Id. at 78:21-79:1.  According to Lt. Spina, it could \ntake approximately one day before an inmate was finally admitted into the general population.  \nSee Lt. Spina Dep. at 111:13-114:4.   \nIn late 2007, Lt. Spina recommended that the Ocean County Jail install an opaque \n“privacy” curtain in one of the shower stalls in the changing area.  Id. at 121:10-124:23, 126:17-\n24.  This “privacy” curtain replaced the full curtain with a shorter curtain that enabled officers to \nsee an inmate’s head and everything from their thighs down.  Id. at 127:3-12.  Lt. Spina testified \nthat the decision to install the curtain was to “get away from the perception that the [non-\nindictable] inmates were being strip searched….”  Id. at 122:19-123:11.  However, he explained \nthat he was not aware of any detainees who had ever made complaints to corrections officers that \n                                                 \n4 Sgt. Martin testified, in this case, as a representative of Ocean County in accordance with Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 30(b)(6).   \n  8 \n\nthey were strip searched.  Id. at 123:12-24.  After the curtain was installed in 2008, pretrial \ndetainees charged with non-indictable offenses were no longer required to completely disrobe in \nfront of a corrections officer for visual observation or inspection.  Rather, the inmate would be \nafforded privacy behind the curtain while the officer could still monitor the inmate during the \nclothing change.  \nE.  Procedural History \nOn November 28, 2007, Plaintiffs Jose Garcia (“Garcia”), Wesley K. Bell (“Bell”), \nBizzarro and Wright filed this action against Defendants.  On January 11, 2008, those Plaintiffs \nfiled an Amended Complaint.  Three days later, Wedding was added as a plaintiff in this matter.  \nBy an Order dated June 5, 2008, Plaintiffs Garcia and Bell, who is now deceased, were \nvoluntarily dismissed from this action by stipulation.  Thus, the remaining Plaintiffs are Bizzarro, \nWright and Wedding.  These Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint against \nDefendants on September 15, 2008.  On October 18, 2008, Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the \nclass.  In a written Opinion, dated June 9, 2009, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion and \napproved the following attorneys as class counsel: Elmer R. Keach, III, Esq., Seth Lesser, Esq., \nFran L. Rudich, Esq., Charles LaDuca, Esq., Alexandra C. Warren, Esq. and William A. Riback, \nEsq.5  In accordance with the dictates of that Opinion, Plaintiffs then filed their Third Amended \nComplaint on June 29, 2009.   \n                                                 \n5 As discussed infra, after being approved by this Court, the following attorneys withdrew their \nappearance as counsel for Plaintiffs and the class: Mr. Lesser, Ms. Rudich, Mr. LaDuca and Ms. \nWarren.  In addition, Mr. Keach submitted a letter to the Magistrate Judge seeking “guidance \nregarding the procedure [he] should use to end [his] involvement in this case.”  Dkt. No. 57.  The \nMagistrate Judge instructed Mr. Keach to file an application to withdraw, but it appears that he \nnever did so.   Thus, the remaining class counsel are Messrs. Keach and Riback.  In November \n2013, Carl D. Poplar, Esq. filed his notice of appearance on behalf of Plaintiffs in this case, but \nhe has not been approved by this Court as co-class counsel. \n  9 \n\nOn August 18, 2009, Defendants filed a motion to stay the proceeding pending a decision \nfrom the Third Circuit in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, \n621 F.3d 296 (3d Cir. 2010), which this Court granted on November 16, 2009, and the case was \nadministratively terminated.  After the Third Circuit decided the case in Florence, on March 3, \n2011, Plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay of proceedings, even though the plaintiff in \nFlorence filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the United States Supreme Court on \nJanuary 19, 2011.  The Supreme Court granted the petition in Florence on April 4, 2011.  On \nApril 12, 2011, this Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion and concluded that this case would remain \nadministratively terminated pending a decision by the Supreme Court in Florence.  On April 2, \n2012, the Supreme Court decided Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of \nBurlington, 566 U.S. 318 (2012).6   \nMore than one year later, Plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay of proceedings and for \nleave to file an amended complaint.  On March 13, 2014, the Magistrate Judge granted Plaintiffs’ \nmotion, and Plaintiffs filed their Fourth Amended Complaint on March 25, 2014.7  In their \nFourth Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs define the class as follows: \nAll persons who have been (1) detained at and/or placed into the custody of the \nOcean County Jail or any facility under the authority of Ocean County (2) as a \nresult of being arrested and/or charged with non-indictable offenses such as: civil \n                                                 \n6 In Florence, the Court addressed “whether every detainee who will be admitted to the general \npopulation may be required to undergo a close visual inspection while undressed.”  Florence, 566 \nU.S. at 322.  Reasoning that correctional officers at jails have a “significant interest in \nconducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake process,” id. at 330, the Court \nconcluded that a policy and practice of routine, suspicionless strip searches of all detainees, \nincluding minor offenders, that will be housed in the general population does not violate the \nFourth Amendment, id. at 339.  \n \n7 Although Mr. Riback signed and filed the Fourth Amended Complaint, both Messrs. Riback \nand Poplar are listed on the docket as counsel for Plaintiffs and the class.  Mr. Keach is not listed \non that complaint. \n  10 \n\nenforcement offenses, i.e., child support enforcement arrears, traffic offenses, \npetty disorderly offenses, disorderly persons offenses, misdemeanors, contempt \nproceedings, failure to pay financial fines, penalties and/or costs in like matters as \nset forth above, and/or failure to appear at any court proceedings on like matters \nabove; (3) were strip searched upon their entry into detainment and/or custody at \nthe Ocean County Jail or were strip searched prior to an appearance before a \njudge or judicial officer who had the authority to release the person as referred to \nabove from detainment and/or custody and were strip searched as set forth above, \nor were strip searched and placed into general population; and (4) the strip search \nwas conducted and/or performed according to Ocean County’s blanket strip \nsearch policy, that is, without reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause based \non objective and articulable facts that the aforesaid person or persons possessed \ncontrolled dangerous substances, weapons and/or contraband. The class period \ncommences on November 28, 2005 and ends on December 28, 2007. \nFourth Am. Compl., ¶ 17.  According to Plaintiffs, the size of the class totals at least 4,000 \npersons.  Id. at ¶ 19.  In Count One, Plaintiffs assert a claim for violations of the Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as well as Article I, \nParagraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution, pursuant to the New Jersey Civil Rights Act \n(“NJCRA”), N.J.S.A. § 10:6-1, et seq.  In Count Two, Plaintiffs assert a claim for violation of \nthe New Jersey Strip Search Statute under the NJCRA.  \nOn January 15, 2015, Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment, which \nPlaintiffs opposed, and Plaintiffs cross-moved to appoint Carol Poplar, Esq. as co-class counsel. \nWhile the motions were pending, on July 1, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file \nsupplemental briefing addressing several recent opinions.  On August 3, 2015, the Magistrate \nJudge granted Plaintiffs’ motion and administratively terminated the pending motion for \nsummary judgment.  On August 10, 2015, Plaintiffs filed their supplemental brief and \nDefendants responded on August 24, 2015.  Upon the request of Plaintiffs, this Court granted \nPlaintiffs’ request to file a three-page reply to Defendants’ response, which Plaintiffs \nsubsequently filed on August 31, 2015.  On September 22, 2015, this Court administratively \nterminated Plaintiffs’ cross-motion to appoint Carl D. Poplar.   \n  11 \n\nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nSummary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a \nmatter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  A factual dispute is genuine only if there is “a sufficient \nevidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party,” and it is \nmaterial only if it has the ability to “affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.”  \nKaucher v. County of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir. 2006); see also Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  Disputes over irrelevant or unnecessary facts will not \npreclude a grant of summary judgment.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  “In considering a motion \nfor summary judgment, a district court may not make credibility determinations or engage in any \nweighing of the evidence; instead, the non-moving party’s evidence ‘is to be believed and all \njustifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.’”  Marino v. Indus. Crating Co., 358 F.3d 241, \n247 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255); see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. \nZenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Curley v. Klem, 298 F.3d 271, 276-77 (3d Cir. \n2002). \nThe party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of showing the basis for \nits motion.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  “If the moving party will bear \nthe burden of persuasion at trial, that party must support its motion with credible evidence . . . \nthat would entitle it to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial.”  Id. at 331.  On the other \nhand, if the burden of persuasion at trial would be on the nonmoving party, the party moving for \nsummary judgment may satisfy Rule 56’s burden of production by either (1) “submit[ting] \naffirmative evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving party’s claim”  or (2) \n  12 \n\ndemonstrating “that the nonmoving party’s evidence is insufficient to establish an essential \nelement of the nonmoving party’s claim.”  Id.  Once the movant adequately supports its motion \npursuant to Rule 56(c), the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to “go beyond the pleadings and \nby her own affidavits, or by the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \ndesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Id. at 324; see also \nMatsushita, 475 U.S. at 586; Ridgewood Bd. of Ed. v. Stokley, 172 F.3d 238, 252 (3d Cir. 1999).  \nIn deciding the merits of a party’s motion for summary judgment, the court’s role is not to \nevaluate the evidence and decide the truth of the matter, but to determine whether there is a \ngenuine issue for trial. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.  Credibility determinations are the province of \nthe factfinder.  Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. \n1992). \nThere can be “no genuine issue as to any material fact,” however, if a party fails “to make \na showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on \nwhich that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.”  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.  “[A] \ncomplete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party’s case \nnecessarily renders all other facts immaterial.”  Id. at 323; see Katz v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., \n972 F.2d 53, 55 (3d Cir. 1992). \nIII.   DISCUSSION \nA.  Appointment of Class Counsel  \nIn an Opinion, dated June 9, 2009, this Court appointed Plaintiffs’ attorneys as class \ncounsel, but several attorneys subsequently withdrew their appearances in this case.8  On \n                                                 \n8 While Mr. Keach expressed a desire to withdraw as counsel, he never actually filed such an \napplication and, consequently, he is still listed as co-class counsel in this matter.  Nevertheless, it \nappears that Mr. Keach is no longer an active participant in this litigation, since he was not \n  13 \n\nNovember 6, 2013, Mr. Poplar filed his appearance on behalf of Plaintiffs, but he has not been \napproved as a co-class counsel.  In their cross-motion, Plaintiffs specifically submit that “Carl \nPoplar, Esquire is qualified and should be appointed as co-Class Counsel.”  Pl.’s Br. in Opp. at p. \n34.  In support of that motion, Mr. Poplar has supplied a supplemental certification concerning \nhis qualifications.  Defendants do not oppose Plaintiffs’ cross-motion to appoint to Mr. Poplar.   \n  The Third Circuit has adopted a two-prong test for determining the adequacy of \nrepresentation by the named Plaintiffs and their counsel: “(a) the plaintiff’s attorney must be \nqualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation, and (b) the plaintiff \nmust not have interests antagonistic to those of the class.”   Wetzel v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 508 \nF.2d 239, 247 (3d Cir. 1975).  The burden of proving that the representation is not adequate rests \nwith the party challenging the class’ representation.  Wilson v. County of Gloucester, 256 F.R.D. \n479, 487-88 (D.N.J. 2009); see Schwartz v. Avis Rent a Car Sys., LLC, No. 11-4052, 2014 WL \n4272018, at *16 (D.N.J. Aug. 28, 2014).  Because this Court has previously determined that \nPlaintiffs are representative of the class, the only question is whether Mr. Poplar is capable of \nadequately represent the class.  \n  In his certification, dated September 29, 2015, Mr. Poplar states that he graduated from \nRutgers School of Law – Camden, and that he is certified as both a criminal and civil trial \nattorney by the New Jersey Board on Trial Attorney Certification.  See Dkt. No. 116, Ex. A.  Mr. \nPoplar is also a member of several professional organizations, including the American College of \nTrial Lawyers, and he has “lectured in numerous Continuing Legal Education programs and \n[has] been an Adjunct Professor of Trial Advocacy at Rutgers School of Law – Camden.”  Id. at \n                                                 \ninvolved in filing the Fourth Amended Complaint, nor the opposition to Defendants’ instant \nmotion and Plaintiffs’ cross-motion to appoint Mr. Poplar as co-class counsel.  \n  14 \n\n¶ 4.  Mr. Poplar explains that he has substantial experience conducting class action litigation.  \nSee Id. at ¶ 5.  Relevant here, Mr. Poplar certifies that he is “co-lead counsel with William \nRiback in [five] class action strip search litigation[s].”  Id.  Mr. Poplar also certifies that he is \npresently involved in six other class litigations in both federal and state courts.  Id. at ¶ 6.  \nAccordingly, based on his certification and Defendants’ non-objection to his appointment, the \nCourt finds that Mr. Poplar is “qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the \nproposed litigation,” and as such, approves Mr. Poplar as co-class counsel nunc pro tunc to \nNovember 6, 2013, the date that Mr. Poplar filed his notice of appearance here.  See Wetzel, 508 \nF.2d at 247. \nB.  § 1983 Claim for Violation of the Fourth Amendment \nIn Count One, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants, specifically Hunter and Mueller, \nimplemented a policy and practice of strip searching all detainees, including detainees charged \nwith non-indictable offenses, as part of the intake procedure at the Ocean County Jail from \nNovember 28, 2005 through December 28, 2007.  Plaintiffs assert that these strip searches \noccurred before detainees appeared before a judge, and that the Ocean County Jail should have \nsegregated detainees charged with non-indictable offenses from the general population because \nthey are frequently not dangerous and are often released shortly after being placed in custody.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs assert that correctional officers at the Ocean County Jail performed these strip \nsearches regardless of the nature of the crime charged or the existence of reasonable suspicion \nthat the detainee was concealing a weapon or some other contraband. \nWith respect to Plaintiffs’ claim for violation of the Fourth Amendment, Defendants \nargue that the Supreme Court in Florence held that correctional officials are allowed to conduct a \nstrip search of all detainees, including detainees charged with non-indictable offenses, who are \n  15 \n\nassigned to the general population of a detention center.  Thus, Defendants contend that Ocean \nCounty Jail’s policy and practice, in 2005 through 2007, of performing strip searches before \ndetainees were committed to the general population is constitutional under the Fourth \nAmendment.  In response, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ written policy and practice of strip \nsearching detainees charged with non-indictable offenses is unconstitutional, since the \ncircumstances of this case fall within Justice Alito’s exception to the majority’s holding in \nFlorence.  Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that it is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to strip \nsearch a detainee charged with a non-indictable offense who has not appeared before a judge and \nwho could have been held separately from the general population.9 \nThe Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons… \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures.”10  U.S. Const. amend. IV.  Nevertheless, pretrial \ndetainees and convicted prisoners only have limited rights under the Fourth Amendment.  See \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558 (1979) (inmates “retain some Fourth Amendment rights upon \n                                                 \n9 Plaintiffs seek to invoke the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, specifically arguing that this \nCourt should only address Plaintiffs’ New Jersey State law claims and avoid deciding their claim \nfor violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Under the avoidance doctrine, the Supreme Court has \nstated that “normally the Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other \nground upon which to dispose of the case.”  Escambia County v. McMillan, 466 U.S. 48, 51 \n(1984); see Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., \nconcurring).  However, the doctrine has “little utility once a question has already been raised and \nanswered.”  Chavez-Rivas v. Olsen, 207 F. Supp. 2d 326, 331 (D.N.J. 2002).  Indeed, “common \nsense suggests that a question already recently settled need no longer be avoided, even if it \nremains somewhat controversial.”  Id.  As discussed infra, courts in this circuit have already \naddressed whether, in light of Florence, a blanket policy of strip searching detainees charged \nwith non-indictable offenses as part of the intake procedure is constitutional.  Thus, this Court \nwill not analyze Plaintiffs’ state law claims first.  \n \n10 “The Fourteenth Amendment extends Fourth Amendment protections to searches and seizures \nby state officials.”  Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 324 n.6 (3d Cir. 2016). \n  16 \n\ncommitment to a corrections facility….”); see also Parkell, 833 F.3d at 324 (stating “the contours \nof prisoners’ Fourth Amendment rights… are very narrow.”).  In determining whether a \nparticular policy is reasonable, courts must balance between an inmate’s constitutional right to \nprivacy and the needs of the institution to maintain safety and security.  See Florence, 566 U.S. \nat 326-27; see also Parkell, 833 F.3d at 326.  Specifically, “[c]ourts must consider the scope of \nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and \nthe place in which it is conducted.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. \nIn implementing strip search policies, correctional officers are afforded considerable \ndeference, because “[t]he task of determining whether a policy is reasonably related to legitimate \nsecurity interests is ‘peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of corrections \nofficials.’”  Florence, 566 U.S. at 328 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 548).  Indeed, “courts must \ndefer to the judgment of correctional officials unless the record contains substantial evidence \nshowing their policies are an unnecessary or unjustified response to problems of jail security.”  \nId. at 322-23.  A policy or “regulation impinging on an inmate’s constitutional rights must be \nupheld if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”  Id. at 326 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).   \nIn Florence, the petitioner was arrested after a traffic stop for an outstanding bench \nwarrant.  Id. at 323.  Seven years before that incident, the petitioner was arrested for fleeing from \nthe police, and was charged with obstruction of justice and use of a deadly weapon.  Id.  The \npetitioner subsequently “entered a plea of guilty to two lesser offenses and was sentenced to pay \na fine in monthly installments.”  Id.  At some point, the petitioner “fell behind on his payments \nand failed to appear at an enforcement hearing, [so] a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.”  \n  17 \n\nId.  Although he paid the balance of the fine before his arrest, “for some unexplained reason, the \nwarrant remained in a statewide computer database.”  Id.   \nAfter his arrest for an outstanding bench warrant, the petitioner was brought to the \nBurlington County Detention Center (“BCDC”) where he was subjected to a strip search upon \nadmission to jail.11  Id.  In particular, the petitioner claimed that he was required to lift his \ngenitals, turn around, and cough while squatting.  Id.  After six days, the petitioner was moved to \nthe Essex County Detention Center (“ECDC”), where “an officer looked at [his] ears, nose, \nmouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits, and other body openings,” including his \ngenitals, upon entering the detention facility.  Id. at 324.  However, only one day after the \ntransfer, the charges against the petitioner were dropped and he was released.  Id.  After his \nrelease, the petitioner filed suit against the governmental entities that operated the jail. \nBefore the Supreme Court, the petitioner argued that “there is little benefit to conducting \nthese more invasive steps [such as requiring a detainee to lift their genitals or cough in a \nsquatting position] on a new detainee who has not been arrested for a serious crime or for any \noffense involving a weapon or drugs.”  Id. at 334.  Instead, the petitioner maintained that “these \ndetainees should be exempt from this process unless they give officers a particular reason to \nsuspect them of hiding contraband.”  Id.  The Supreme Court disagreed and declared that \n                                                 \n11 The Supreme Court noted that term “strip search” is often inexact: \nIt may refer simply to the instruction to remove clothing while an officer observes \nfrom a distance of, say, five feet or more; it may mean a visual inspection from a \ncloser, more uncomfortable distance; it may include directing detainees to shake \ntheir heads or to run their hands through their hair to dislodge what might be \nhidden there; or it may involve instructions to raise arms, to display foot insteps, \nto expose the back of the ears, to move or spread the buttocks or genital areas, or \nto cough in a squatting position. \nId. at 325. \n  18 \n\n“[c]orrectional officials have a legitimate interest, indeed a responsibility, to ensure that jails are \nnot made less secure by reason of what new detainees may carry in [to the jail] on their bodies.  \nFacility personnel, other inmates, and the new detainee himself or herself may be in danger if \nthese threats are introduced into the jail population.”  Id. at 322.   \nIn maintaining safety in jail facilities, which often “can be even more dangerous than \nprisons because officials there know so little about the people they admit at the outset,” the \nSupreme Court articulated three types of threats justifying a blanket strip search policy: (i) the \ndanger of introducing health risks; (ii) increased gang activities within jails; and (iii) the \nprevention of contraband from entering the general population.  Id. at 330-334, 336; see J.B. ex \nrel. Benjamin v. Fassnacht, 801 F.3d 336, 339 (3d Cir. 2015).  Based on these threats, the Court \ndeclared that “[t]here is a substantial interest in preventing any new inmate… from putting all \nwho live or work at these institutions at even greater risk when he is admitted to the general \npopulation.”  Florence, 566 U.S. at 333-34. \nAfter deferring to the expertise of correctional officers, the Supreme Court concluded \njails are not required to adopt a policy of exempting detainees charged with minor offenses from \na routine, suspicionless strip search conducted during the intake procedure so long as the \ndetainee is assigned to be housed in the general population at some point.  Id. at 334-35.  The \nCourt concluded that the petitioner’s view that detainees should be exempt from a strip search \nunless there is a reason to suspect the detainee of hiding contraband is “unworkable,” since “[t]he \nrecord provides evidence that the seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who has \ncontraband and that it would be difficult in practice to determine whether individual detainees \nfall within the proposed exemption.”  Id. at 334. \n  19 \n\nIn light of the decision in Florence, the Third Circuit has reaffirmed that strip searches are \nreasonable when an inmate is assigned to be moved to the general population of a detention \ncenter.  See Fassnacht, 801 F.3d at 341 (“Relying on the importance of deference to correctional \nofficials, Florence permitted strip searches of all detainees admitted to the general population of \na detention facility.”); see also Small v. Wetzel, 528 Fed. Appx. 202, 207 (3d Cir. 2013) (stating \nthat the “Court in Florence held that it is constitutional to conduct a full strip search of an \nindividual detained in the general population of a jail, regardless of the reason for detention or \nthe existence of reasonable suspicion that the individual is concealing something.”).  Indeed, so \nlong as the search is done as a precaution before placing an inmate in the general population, the \nThird Circuit has held that “[r]outine, suspicionless inmate search policies may sweep quite \nbroadly and still be reasonable.”  Parkell, 833 F.3d at 329 (citing Florence, 566 U.S. at 334). \nIn the instant matter, the facts are strikingly similar to the facts in Florence.12  It is \nundisputed that, between November 2005 and December 2007, the Ocean County Jail \nimplemented a policy and practice of conducting a strip search on all detainees charged with \n                                                 \n12 In their briefing, Plaintiffs contend that the petitioner in Florence was arrested pursuant to a \nwarrant for an indictable offense, as opposed to a warrant for a non-indictable offense.  Plaintiffs \nare mistaken.  The petitioner’s warrant in Florence was issued based on his failure to pay a fine \nimposed as part of a plea deal in a criminal action and his failure to appear at an enforcement \nhearing.  Florence, 566 U.S. at 323-34.  In that regard, the Supreme Court noted that “[t]he \nDistrict Court certified a class of individuals who were charged with a nonindictable offense \nunder New Jersey law, processed at either the [BCDC] or [ECDC], and directed to strip naked \neven though an officer had not articulated any reasonable suspicion they were concealing \ncontraband.”  Id. at 324-25 (emphasis added).  Finally, in Florence, the petitioner specifically \nargued that persons arrested for a minor offense should not be subjected to a strip search as a \nroutine part of the intake process, id. at 334, but the Court disagreed and held that all detainees – \neven for a minor offense – may be required to undergo a strip search upon entry to a detention \ncenter, id. at 339.  Therefore, the petitioner in Florence was not arrested pursuant to a warrant for \na more serious crime, but rather, he was arrested for minor offenses. \n \n  20 \n\nnon-indictable offenses upon their entry to the Ocean County Jail.  All of the Plaintiffs have \ntestified that that they were required to remove their clothing, including their underwear, in front \nof a correctional officer for a close visual inspection during the intake process.  Like the \npetitioner in Florence, Plaintiffs testified that they were required to manipulate their genitals \nwhile correctional officers inspected for any contraband or other threats to the safety and security \nof the facility.  Once the strip search was completed, the officers provided prison uniforms and \nshoes to wear in the jail.   \nCritically, the parties do not dispute that all inmates that entered the Ocean County Jail, \nincluding Plaintiffs, were assigned to be moved to the general population, and that both Wedding \nand Bizzarro were actually placed in the general population at the Ocean County Jail.  See \nWedding Dep. at 29:2-22, 30:5-31:23; Bizzarro Dep. at 26:32:7-16, 28:3-8.  Wedding was \nhoused in the general population for two days, and Bizzarro spent approximately one week in the \ngeneral population before he was released.  See id.  Although Wright made bail approximately \ntwelve hours after his arrest, he was also waiting to be housed in the general population.  See \nWright Dep. at 20:22-21:8.  Accordingly, based on the Supreme Court’s holding in Florence, \nDefendants’ policy and practice, in 2005 through 2007, of performing blanket, suspicionless strip \nsearches of minor offenders that were assigned to the general population of the Ocean County \nJail was constitutional, since the Supreme Court has previously found a legitimate penological \ninterest in preventing contraband and other risks from infiltrating the general population, which \noutweighs Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to privacy under the Fourth Amendment.  \nNevertheless, Plaintiffs contend that Justice Alito’s concurrence in Florence establishes \nan exception that “precludes strip searches of all non-indictable detainees prior to their \nintroduction in the general population,” regardless of whether that individual was arrested \n  21 \n\npursuant to a warrant.  Pls.’ Br. in Opp. at p. 11 (emphasis in original).  While this argument \nappears to be directly at odds with the Court’s holding in Florence, Plaintiffs clarify that \nDefendants’ policy and practice of conducting a strip search as part of the intake procedure is a \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment because, under Justice Alito’s rationale, a detainee charged \nwith non-indictable offenses cannot be strip searched until he or she is actually moved into the \ngeneral population, which could take approximately 24 hours at the Ocean County Jail.  Indeed, \nPlaintiffs contend that it makes sense to delay the strip searches of detainees who are not \ndangerous13 and likely to be released prior to their introduction into the general population.  \nBefore discussing Justice Alito’s concurrence, the Court finds it helpful to examine \nJustice Kennedy’s reservation of issues in the majority opinion, as well as Chief Justice Robert’s \nconcurrence emphasizing the narrowness of the majority’s holding.  Justice Kennedy, writing on \nbehalf of the majority, stated that “[t]his case does not require [us] to rule on the types of \nsearches that would be reasonable in instances where… a detainee will be held without \nassignment to the general population and without substantial contact with other detainees.”14 \n                                                 \n13 To the extent that Plaintiffs argue that correctional officers must have reasonable suspicion to \nstrip search a detainee charged with a non-indictable offense, the Supreme Court clearly \ndisagrees.  In fact, the Court directly addressed that issue in Florence, holding that correctional \nofficers have a significant interest in conducting routine, suspicionless searches of all detainees, \nincluding minor offenders.  See Florence, 566 U.S. at 330, 334-35; see also Parkell, 833 F.3d at \n329.  Correctional officers are not required to consider the individual characteristics of a detainee \nbefore performing a strip search, nor are the officials required to articulate a particular suspicion \nthat a detainee was attempting to smuggle contraband into the facility.  Id.  To be clear, under the \nFourth Amendment, correctional officers at the Ocean County Jail were not required to establish \nreasonable suspicion before they performed strip searches on Plaintiffs.  \n \n14 As an example, Justice Kennedy cited Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318 (2001).  See \nFlorence, 566 U.S. at 338-39.  In that case, the detainee was arrested for a misdemeanor seatbelt \nviolation punishable only by a fine and, upon arriving at the local police station, the “[o]fficers \ntook [the detainee’s] ‘mug shot’ and placed her, alone, in a jail cell for about one hour, after \n  22 \n\nFlorence, 566 U.S. at 338-39.  According to Justice Kennedy, when a detainee is not assigned to \nbe placed in the general population, but is held separately from other detainees, “[t]he \naccommodations provided in these situations may diminish the need to conduct some aspects of \nthe searches at issue.”  Id. at 339.   \nIn his concurrence, Chief Justice Roberts declared that “it is important for me that the \nCourt does not foreclose the possibility of an exception to the rule it announces.”  Id. at 340 \n(Roberts, C.J., concurring).  Because “[f]actual nuances have not played a significant role as this \ncase has been presented,” Chief Justice Roberts cautioned that “[t]he Court is nonetheless wise to \nleave open the possibility of exceptions, to ensure that we not embarrass the future.”  Id. (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  Similar to Justice Kennedy, Chief Justice Roberts pointed \nout that the lack of factual nuances “include the facts that Florence was detained not for a minor \ntraffic offense but instead pursuant to a warrant for his arrest, and that there was apparently no \nalternative, if Florence were to be detained, to holding him in the general population.”  Id.   \nIn a separate concurrence, Justice Alito also emphasized the narrowness the majority’s \nholding when he explained that “it is important to note… that the Court does not hold that it is \nalways reasonable to conduct a full strip search of an arrestee whose detention has not been \nreviewed by a judicial officer and who could be held in available facilities apart from the general \npopulation.”  Id. at 341 (Alito, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).  Justice Alito reasoned that \n“[m]ost of those arrested for minor offenses are not dangerous, and most are released from \ncustody prior to or at the time of their initial appearance before a magistrate….  For these \n                                                 \nwhich she was taken before a magistrate and released on $310 bond.”  Atwater, 532 U.S. at 323-\n24.  That scenario is starkly different from the circumstances in this case, because Plaintiffs, \nhere, were detained pursuant to warrants and they were assigned to be housed in the general \npopulation of the Ocean County Jail. \n  23 \n\npersons, admission to the general jail population, with the concomitant humiliation of a strip \nsearch, may not be reasonable, particularly if an alternative procedure is feasible.”  Id. at 341-42.  \nJustice Alito suggested, for example, that “some local jails appear to segregate temporary \ndetainees who are minor offenders from the general population.”  Id. at 342.   \nCourts have struggled to decipher Justice Alito’s concurrence and its impact on the \nmajority’s holding that correctional officers may require all detainees who are assigned to the \ngeneral population to undergo a strip search.  In line with Plaintiffs’ argument, some courts in \nthis circuit “have [] interpreted Florence as embracing an exception – albeit one whose precise \ncontours are undefined at this point and time.”  Haas v. Burlington County, 955 F. Supp. 2d 334, \n342-43 (D.N.J. 2013).  However, other courts have expressed doubts whether Justice Alito \nactually created an exception.  See Crump v. Passaic County, 147 F. Supp. 3d 249, 255-56 \n(D.N.J. 2015) (“Concurring, Justice Alito emphasized the limits of the Court’s holding”); Moore \nv. Atlantic County, No. 07-5444, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33160, at *26 (D.N.J. Mar. 18, 2015) \n(referring to Justice Alito’s concurrence as the “so-called Florence ‘exception’”); Conner v. \nMastronardy, No. 13-3034, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66854, at *9-10 (D.N.J. May 15, 2014) \n(“Justice Alito noted in his concurrence that the holding in Florence was limited” and was simply \na “reservation of issues”).  Indeed, Justice Alito stated that his concurrence only “emphasize[s] \nthe limits of today’s holding.”  Florence, 566 U.S. at 340 (Alito, J., concurring).  While the Third \nCircuit has not directly addressed whether Justice Alito’s concurrence created an exception to the \nmajority’s holding, the court advised that Justice Alito “emphasized the narrowness of the \nCourt’s holding” and left open the possibility that a blanket strip search policy may not always \nbe constitutional.  Parkell, 833 F.3d at 330 n.11; see Fassnacht, 801 F.3d at 341.   \n  24 \n\nBased on the guidance provided by the Third Circuit and other courts in this district, as \nwell as the plain language of Justice Alito’s concurrence, it does not appear that Justice Alito \ncreated an exception to the majority’s holding, but rather, he only highlighted the narrowness of \nthe Court’s decision in Florence and provided guidance on what may be considered an \nunconstitutional strip search procedure in the future.  Nevertheless, even assuming that Justice \nAlito established an exception that includes persons arrested pursuant to a warrant, this Court \nconcludes that each of the Plaintiffs’ circumstances do not fall within such an exception, since \nPlaintiffs have failed to establish that the Ocean County Jail had an alternative housing solution \nfor detainees with non-indictable offenses between November 28, 2005 and December 28, \n2007.15 \nJustice Alito set forth a two-prong inquiry requiring a plaintiff to show: (i) that the \ndetainee’s detention was not reviewed by a judicial officer; and (ii) that the detainee could be \nheld in available facilities apart from the general population.  Florence, 566 U.S. at 341-42 \n(Alito, J., concurring); see Moore, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33160, at *26.   \n                                                 \n15 Both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy state that the limitation of the Court’s holding \nis reserved for detainees who were arrested without a warrant, as opposed to the petitioner in \nFlorence, who was arrested pursuant to an outstanding bench warrant.  See Florence, 566 U.S. at \n338-39; id. at 340 (Roberts, C.J., concurring).  With respect to the first prong of his concurrence, \nJustice Alito did not expressly address whether his analysis was limited to warrantless arrests, or \nwhether he intended to include persons arrested pursuant to a warrant for a non-indictable \noffense.  See Haas, 955 F. Supp. 2d at 344.  Instead, “[h]e simply and ambiguously (intentionally \nor not) refers to ‘an arrestee whose detention has not been reviewed by a judicial officer.’”  Id. \n(quoting Florence, 566 U.S. at 341).  Based on that ambiguity, Plaintiffs argue that Justice Alito \nintended to include detainees charged with non-indictable offenses, and that he also required that \nthese detainees be strip searched only after they were subject to post-arrest review by a judicial \nofficer, such as an initial appearance or hearing.  However, the Court need not address those \nissues, because Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the second prong of Justice Alito’s “exception,” i.e., that \nthe detainee could be held in available facilities separate from the general population.   \n \n  25 \n\nWith respect to the second prong, I find the decision in Moore to be instructive.16  In that \ncase, the plaintiffs initiated a putative class action lawsuit against the Atlantic County \nCorrectional Facility (the “ACCF”) for violation of their Fourth Amendment rights based on the \nACCF’s policy and practice of subjecting detainees charged with non-indictable offenses, such \nas the failure to make child support payments, to strip searches as part of the intake process.  \nMoore, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33160, at *2-4.  There, the plaintiffs testified that, after arriving \nat the ACCF, correctional officers instructed each of the plaintiffs to remove their clothes, lift \ntheir genitals and spread their butt cheeks while an officer used a flashlight to search for \ncontraband.  Id. at *3-4.  Like the Plaintiffs in this case, the plaintiffs in Moore argued that “the \ncircumstances of [their] case fall under an exception to the Florence holding,” and that the ACCF \nviolated their constitutional rights by performing the strip search before their actual introduction \ninto the general population.  Id. at *18-20.  \n                                                 \n16 Plaintiffs argue that Moore is factually inapposite and incorrectly decided.  Specifically, \nPlaintiffs contend that the plaintiffs in Moore were subjected to “cavity searches,” not strip \nsearches like the petitioner in Florence.  In Moore, the plaintiffs similarly argued that it was the \ndefendant’s policy to conduct “cavity searches,” as defined by the New Jersey Strip Search \nStatute, but the court concluded that, “[w]hile the type of search at issue may be considered a \n‘cavity search’ under the New Jersey Strip Search Statute, it is virtually identical to the type of \nsearch considered by the Supreme Court in Florence.”  Moore, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33160, at \n*20 n.9.  Here, both the searches in Florence and Moore are nearly identical to the searches in \nthis matter, and as such, I am not persuaded by Plaintiffs’ argument.  \n  Next, Plaintiffs contend that Moore is distinguishable because the plaintiffs, and almost \nall other detainees at the Atlantic County Correctional Facility, consented to being strip searched.  \nHowever, the plaintiffs in Moore specifically argued that the detention center’s policy was a \n“pretext” for a blanket policy of searching all detainees “regardless of whether consent was \nobtained.”  Id. at *23-24.  As a result, one of the issues before the court was whether a de facto \nblanket policy allowing all detainees charged with non-indictable offenses to undergo strip \nsearches, absent reasonable suspicion that the detainee had weapons or other contraband, is \nconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at *25-26.  The court in Moore found that such \na policy was, in fact, constitutional.  Id. \n  26 \n\nIn granting the ACCF’s motion for summary judgment, and denying the plaintiffs’ cross-\nmotion for summary judgment, the court reasoned that Florence “held that an institution’s policy \nof subjecting every incoming detainee who would enter into the general population to a strip \nsearch, regardless of whether there was reasonable suspicion that the detainee may be in \npossession of contraband, drugs, or weapons, did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.”  Id. at *19-20.  Because the record did not contain any evidence that \nthe ACCF’s strip search policies were an unnecessary or unjustified response to the problem of \ncontraband and other threats being introduced to the general population, the court concluded that \n“the holding in Florence clearly allows for such policies under the circumstances as they exist in \nthis case.”  Id. at *25-26.   \nIn addition, the court held that “the so-called Florence ‘exception’ cannot save Plaintiffs’ \nclaim.”  Id. at 26.  The court reasoned that “[t]he exception may exist if two circumstances are \ntrue: the arrestee’s detention has not yet been reviewed by a judicial officer, and the arrestee can \nbe held apart from the general population.”  Id. (emphasis in original).  Solely addressing \nwhether the plaintiffs could have been held separately from the general population, the court \nfound that all non-indictable detainees, including the plaintiffs, were assigned to the general \npopulation, and that the parties did not dispute that the ACCF lacked the capacity to hold non-\nindictable detainees in facilities removed from the general populations.  Id. at *26-28; see \nCollazo v. Cnty. of Lancaster, No. 10-7010, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124586, at *20-21 (E.D. Pa. \nAug. 31, 2012) (concluding that “the possible exception” alluded to by Justice Alito did not \napply because the plaintiff provided “no evidence regarding the availability of alternative \nfacilities removed from Lancaster County Prison’s general population.”).  \n  27 \n\nIn the instant matter, it is undisputed that Plaintiffs were all assigned to be housed in the \ngeneral population at the Ocean County Jail, and Defendants have established that, between \nNovember 2005 and December 2007, Plaintiffs and other detainees charged with non-indictable \noffenses could not have been held in facilities apart from the general population based on \novercrowding.  See Declaration of Mary J. Lidaka, Esq. (“Lidaka Decl.”), Ex. A, Certification of \nSandra Miller (“Miller Cert.”) at ¶¶ 1-4.  In her certification, Miller stated that she served as the \nChief of Administrative Services at the Ocean County Jail for 31 years, and that, “during the \nrelevant time period... the inmate population at the jail routinely exceeded its maximum \ncapacity.”  Id. at ¶¶ 2-3.  Miller further stated that, based on overcrowding issues, the Ocean \nCounty Jail “did not have the facilities to segregate indictable from non-indictable detainees or \ninmates.”  Id. at ¶ 4.  Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence to the contrary.  Indeed, \nPlaintiffs have not presented any evidence that Defendants had the ability to segregate Plaintiffs, \nwho were held on non-indictable offenses, in an alternative facility removed from the general \npopulation at the Ocean County Jail.  Rather, the evidence in the record reflects that all detainees \nthat entered the Ocean County Jail were assigned to be placed in the general population, and that, \nonce the correctional officers medically examined and classified the detainee, he or she was then \nmoved into the general population. \nMoreover, with respect to the timing of the strip searches, Plaintiffs contend that Justice \nAlito cited the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d \n964 (9th Cir. 2010) for the proposition that detainees charged with minor offense should not be \nstrip searched until they are actually introduced into the general population, which, in this case, \ncould take up to 24 hours.  According to Plaintiffs, any detainee that was strip searched before he \nor she was actually introduced into the general population, or was strip searched and then \n  28 \n\nreleased, has a viable claim under the Fourth Amendment.17  However, Plaintiffs’ argument is \nmisplaced, because it is clear that Justice Alito simply cites to Bull as an example of a local jail \nthat “segregate[s] temporary detainees who are minor offenders from the general population.”  \nFlorence, 566 U.S. at 342 (Alito, J., concurring).  Furthermore, Bull does not stand for the \nproposition that correctional officers are specifically prohibited from strip searching detainees \ncharged with minor offenses until immediately before they enter the general population.   \nIn Bull, the Ninth Circuit held that the implementation of a policy requiring the strip \nsearch of all detainees who are to be introduced into the general population did not violate the \nplaintiffs’ constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment.  Bull, 595 F.3d at 966.  Pursuant to \nSan Francisco’s policy, detainees were initially brought to a temporary intake and release facility \nand, if the detainee could not make bail or otherwise be released, he or she was transferred to a \ncustodial housing facility where the general population was located.  Id. at 968.  Once the \ndetainee arrived at that facility, they “were strip searched prior to admission into the general \npopulation in order to prevent the smuggling of contraband into the facilities.”  Id.  Contrary to \nPlaintiffs’ argument, the Ninth Circuit in Bull only addressed the strip search policy at issue \nthere, i.e., a policy of strip searching detainees after they were transferred from San Francisco’s \ntemporary intake and release facility to the custodial housing facility.  The court in Bull was not \n                                                 \n17 Plaintiffs even suggest that a strip search of a detainee charged with non-indictable offenses \ncannot be performed until after that person is transferred into the general population. This \ninterpretation of Justice Alito’s concurrence is completely at odds with the Supreme Court’s \nconclusion that correctional officers have a legitimate interest in detecting and preventing \ncontraband from entering the general population and “putting all who live or work at these \ninstitutions at even greater risk” of harm.  Florence, 566 U.S. at 333-34.  Indeed, common sense \ndictates that, in order to prevent weapons and other contraband from entering the general \npopulation of a detention center, strip searches must be conducted before the detainee actually \nenters the general population.   \n  29 \n\nconfronted with the issue whether it would be constitutional (or, unconstitutional) for a detention \ncenter, which is incapable of segregating temporary detainees who are minor offenders from the \ngeneral population, to adopt a policy that allows for strip searches to be performed as part of the \ninitial intake procedure.  Because the circumstances in Bull are different than the circumstances \nin Florence and the instant matter, Bull is not helpful to Plaintiffs’ position. \nMoreover, neither Justice Kennedy in the majority opinion, nor Justice Alito in his \nconcurrence, suggest that correctional officers must perform strip searches immediately before \nan inmate is admitted to the general population.  To the contrary, the petitioner in Florence was \nstrip searched upon admission to the BCDC and ECDC, and the Court specifically held that \ncorrectional officers are allowed to conduct a thorough strip search as part of the intake process.  \nFlorence, 566 U.S. at 330, 339.  Additionally, the focus of Justice Alito’s concurrence is not on \nthe constitutionally of a strip search that was performed immediately before a detainee entered \nthe general population, but rather, Justice Alito was concerned with whether a strip search was \nnecessary when a detention center, for example, has the capacity to house detainees charged with \nnon-indictable offenses separate and apart from the general population.  In that regard, it is clear \nthat the fact that some detainees, including Wright, may have been released before they entered \ninto the general population does not place Plaintiffs within the so-called Florence exception, \nbecause, even if they never actually made it into the general population, the Ocean County Jail \ncould not have housed them separately.  See Moore, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33160, at *26-28.   \nFinally, although Plaintiffs contend that detainees charged with non-indictable offenses \nare often not dangerous and should not be strip searched before they actually enter the general \npopulation, the Court in Florence disposes of Plaintiffs’ argument, stating that “[p]eople detained \nfor minor offenses can turn out to be the most devious and dangerous criminals.”  Florence, 566 \n  30 \n\nU.S. at 334.  Indeed, “[t]hese inmates, who might be thought to pose the least risk, have been \ncaught smuggling prohibited items into jail,” and that contraband can easily be concealed “as an \nofficer approaches a suspect’s car or during a brief commotion in a group holding cell.”  Id. at \n333.  Indeed, as explained by the court in Moore, “[t]he entire reason for conducting a search is \nto do so before a detainee would be admitted to his or her final housing location... otherwise the \nrisks necessitating the strip search in the first place cannot be abated.”  Moore, 2015 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 33160, at *27 (emphasis in original)   \nAccordingly, based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Florence, this Court concludes \nthat Defendants’ policy and practice of performing strip searches on all detainees, who were \ndetained pursuant to warrants, including detainees charged with non-indictable offenses, is \nconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment and, assuming that Justice Alito created an \nexception to the majority’s holding, Plaintiffs’ claims still fail because they have not presented \nany evidence that the Ocean County Jail could have held Plaintiffs, and all other detainees \ncharged with minor offenses, in a facility separate and apart from the general population.  \nB.  State Law Claims \n  Plaintiffs assert two state law claims.  In Count One, Plaintiffs assert a NJCRA claim for \nviolation of the New Jersey Constitution, which is identical to Plaintiffs’ claim for violation of \nthe Fourth Amendment.  In Count Two, Plaintiffs assert a NJCRA claim for violation of the New \nJersey Strip Search Statute.  According to Plaintiffs, the New Jersey Legislature delegated \nauthority to the New Jersey Attorney General to establish guidelines for strip searches in \ndetention centers, and the Attorney General required that, in order to strip search detainees \ncharged with non-indictable offenses, a correctional officer must possess either: (i) a search \nwarrant; (ii) voluntary consent; or (iii) reasonable suspicion that the detainee is concealing a \n  31 \n\nweapon or other contraband.  Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants did not satisfy any of those \nprocedural safeguards before strip searching Plaintiffs.  \n  Under 28 U.S.C.S. § 1367, a district court may decline to exercise supplemental \njurisdiction over a claim if the court “has dismissed all claims over which it has original \njurisdiction.”  28 U.S.C.S. § 1367(c)(3).  The Third Circuit has recognized that, when all federal \nclaims are disposed of on a motion for summary judgment, “the district court must decline to \ndecide the pendent state claims” unless extraordinary circumstances exist.  Borough of West \nMifflin v. Lancaster, 45 F.3d 780, 788 (3d Cir. 1995); see Tully v. Mott Supermarkets, Inc., 540 \nF.2d 187, 196 (3d Cir. 1976) (stating that “court[s] should ordinarily refrain from exercising \njurisdiction in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.”); Simmerman v. Corino, 804 F. \nSupp. 644, 658 (D.N.J. 1992) (“[W]here a party’s federal claims are disposed of on a summary \njudgment motion, the court should generally refrain from exercising supplemental jurisdiction \nover the remaining state claims.”), aff’d, 16 F.3d 405 (3d Cir. 1993).  \n  In the instant matter, the Court is cognizant that this matter was stayed for several years \nduring the appeals process in Florence, but the Court declines to exercise its discretion to retain \nsupplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state law claims.18  See Moore, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n33160, at *28-29 (declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ state law claims \nfor violations of the New Jersey constitution and the New Jersey Strip Search Act).  Because the \nparties have already engaged in discovery, they will not be required to expend additional time \n                                                 \n18 Plaintiffs do not argue, nor do they plead in their Fourth Amended Complaint, that this Court \nhas independent jurisdiction over their state law claims under the Class Action Fairness Act \n(“CAFA”), see 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2) (stating that, to establish jurisdiction under CAFA, \nplaintiffs must satisfy the minimal diversity requirements and allege damages that exceed \n$5,000,000).  Instead, Plaintiffs only assert that this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over \ntheir state law claims, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n  32 \n\nand resources in that regard.  In addition, although the parties will have to argue the state law \nclaims before the state court, the Court finds that it is best left to the state court to decide the \nremaining state law claims.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ state law claims in Counts One and Two are \ndismissed without prejudice, the appropriate statutes of limitations are tolled, and Plaintiffs are \ndirected to file their state law claims in the New Jersey state court within thirty (30) days, \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.     \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs’ cross-motion to appoint is GRANTED, and \nCarl Poplar is hereby approved as co-class counsel nunc pro tunc to November 6, 2013.  \nFurthermore, Defendants’ motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim in Count \nOne is hereby dismissed, and this Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over \nPlaintiffs’ remaining state law claims in Counts One and Two.  Thus, those claims are dismissed \nwithout prejudice and the applicable statutes of limitations are tolled; Plaintiffs may re-file their \nstate law claims in State court within thirty (30) days from the date of the Order accompanying \nthis Opinion.  See 28 U.S.C.S. § 1367(c)-(d). \n \n \n \n \nDATE: May 16, 2017           /s/ Freda L. Wolfson \nThe Honorable Freda L. Wolfson \nUnited States District Judge \n \n  33 ",

This is a class action lawsuit brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of \nrights secured to the Plaintiff s and proposed Class by the United States Constitution, the laws of \nthe United States of America and the laws of the State of New Jersey.  From November 28, 2005 \nthrough December 28, 2007, the Ocean County Sheriff's Department and Ocean County \nDepartment of Corrections through its agents, servants, and employees, had an illegal, unlawful \n 1 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 2 of 20 PageID:\n \n1324\npolicy violating the Federal Constitution, the New Jersey Constitution, and/or State laws, and the \nAttorney General Guidelines (hereinafter referred to as “policy” “practice” “violation of law” \n“Constitutional violation” etc.) through its pattern or practice of strip-searching all individuals who \nenter the Ocean County Jail, regardless of the purpose of their detention including but not limited to \nalleged minor offenders. Upon information and belief, this pattern/practice or policy is, in part, \nderived from the written procedures of the Ocean County Sheriff's Department and Ocean County \nDepartment of Corrections, and was promulgated by senior Department officials, including, but not \nlimited to, Theodore J. Hutler, Jr., Warden of the Ocean County Correctional Facility, and Sandra \nMueller, Chief of Corrections of the Ocean County Correctional Facility. \n2.  As a result of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Florence v. Board of \nChosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, 132 S. Ct. 1510 (2012), it remains unconstitutional to \nstrip search minor offenders yet to be seen by a judge to determine their continuing detention. \n3.  Consequently, Edward Bizzarro, Richard Wright, and April Wedding (together, \n“Plaintiffs”) bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class all persons as more \nparticularly defined below in Paragraph 18, who were strip searched at the Ocean County Jail \n(“OCJ”), after being held on minor offenses such as child support warrants or being charged with \nor detained on non-indictable offenses or traffic violations or the matters referred to below in the \nclass definition, prior to being seen by a judge to review their continuing detention in contravention \nof their rights against unreasonable searches under the United States Constitution, the New Jersey \nConstitution, and New Jersey’s applicable Statutes and laws. \n \n4.  Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for themselves and each member of the Class who \nhave suffered from the wrongful actions of the Defendants as described herein, and a declaration \nthat the Sheriff's Department’s and Correction’s Department policies and practices were \n 2 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 3 of 20 PageID:\n \n1325\nunconstitutional and/or unlawful. With the foregoing as background, Plaintiffs Edward Bizzarro, \nRichard Wright, and April Wedding complaint.\n \nJURISDICTION \n \n5.

This Court also hasjurisdiction over this action under \n \nthe provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, inasmuch as it is filed toobtain declaratory relief relative to the \n \nunconstitutionality of the policies of a local government.Supplemental jurisdiction exists over Plaintiffs’ \n \npendent state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1367(a) because Plaintiffs’ state law claims that are so \nrelated to the federal claims within such original jurisdiction that it forms part of the same case or \ncontroversy as do the federal claims. \n6.

Collectively, Warden Hutler, Chief Mueller, and/or others (Policy Making \nDefendants and actors) will be referred to as the “Policy Making Defendants.” \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n16.  Plaintiffs brings this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b), and pursuant to New Jersey Rules of \nCourt, R. 4:32-1 as relates to the pendant state law claims on behalf of themselves and a class of \nsimilarly situated individuals who were arrested for misdemeanors or other minor violations and \nthe matters referred to herein in the Class definition and who were unlawfully and \nunconstitutionally strip searched upon their entry into the Ocean County Jail.1 \n17.  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been (1) detained at and/or placed into the custody of the \nOcean County Jail or any facility under the authority of Ocean County (2) as a result \nof being arrested and/or charged with non-indictable offenses such as: civil \nenforcement offenses i.e., child support enforcement arrears, traffic offenses, petty \ndisorderly offenses, disorderly persons offenses, misdemeanors, contempt \nproceedings, failure to pay financial fines, penalties and/or costs in like matters as set \nforth above, and/or failure to appear at any court proceedings on like matters above; \n                                                 \n1 Strip searches include but are not limited to naked visual searches, or body searches, or cavity searches, or squatting, or \nsquatting and spreading.  \n 6 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 7 of 20 PageID:\n \n1329\n(3)  were strip searched upon their entry into detainment and/or custody at the Ocean \nCounty Jail or were strip searched prior to an appearance before a judge or judicial \nofficer who had the authority to release the person as referred to above from \ndetainment and/or custody and were strip searched as set forth above, or were strip \nsearched and placed into general population; and (4) the strip search was conducted \nand/or performed according to Ocean County’s blanket strip search policy, that is, \nwithout reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause based on objective and \narticulable facts that the aforesaid person or persons possessed controlled dangerous \nsubstances, weapons and/or contraband. The class period commences on November \n28, 2005 and ends on December 28, 2007. \n \n18.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action and \nsatisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy requirements for maintaining a \nclass action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n19.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. There \nare hundreds of people arrested for the aforesaid matters referred to in Paragraph 18 above, who \nwere strip searched under the circumstances described herein. Upon information and belief,; the \nsize of the class totals at least 4,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated \non more than one occasion. \n20.  Joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable because of the large number of \nclass members and the fact that class members are likely dispersed over a large geographical area, \nwith some members presently residing outside of Ocean County and this Judicial District. \nFurthermore, many members of the class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and \nlikely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n21.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, in that they \nall had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants conducting strip \nsearches absent reasonable and particularized suspicion. All members of the class were charged \nwith minor offenses and civil matters as defined at Paragraph 18 when placed into the custody of \nthe Ocean County Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the established law in \n 7 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 8 of 20 PageID:\n \n1330\nthis judicial circuit.  \n22.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the class. Plaintiffs and \nall members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants' course of conduct. The \nharms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n23.  The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the class. \n24.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and success in the \nprosecution of class action and civil rights litigation. Plaintiffs are represented by Carl D. Poplar, \nEsquire of Carl D. Poplar, P.A. and William A. Riback, Esquire, of William Riback, LLC. Counsel \nfor Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members \nof the class. \n25.  Plaintiffs seek to continue certification under Rule 23(b)(3) of this new class \ndefinition. \n26.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the class. These common \nquestions of law and fact include, without limitation, the question of whether the Defendants' \nwritten and/or de facto policies and/or practices of strip searching all individuals charged with non-\nindictable charges or violations or civil matters as defined in Paragraph 18 when transferred to \nand/or placed into detention and/or the custody of the Ocean County Jail is a violation of the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the New Jersey Constitution, the \nNew Jersey law, specifically, N.J.S.A. 10:6-2 and N.J.S.A. 2A:161A-1, and of other applicable law, \n 8 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 9 of 20 PageID:\n \n1331\nand whether such a written and/or de facto policy, and practices existed during the class period \nincluding but not limited to the assertions as set forth herein, the members of the class include but \nare not limited to those individuals detained for matters as set forth in Paragraph 18 that were strip \nsearched prior to judicial review and absent a find of reasonable suspicion. \n27.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudicationof this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the class is \n \nimpracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed \nover a largegeographical area. Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation \n \nwould make itdifficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs \n \ndone to them.The cost to the federal and state court system of adjudicating thousands of \n \nindividual cases would be enormous. Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay \nand expense to all parties andthe court system. By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class \n \naction in this District presentsfar fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the \n \nparties and the court system,and protects the rights of each member of the class.\n   \n28.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though the\n \nDefendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the class period.\n \n29.  Plaintiffs specifically reserve the right to maintain or seek certification of any \nincluded issues or matters under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).\n \nFACTS\n \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n \n30.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \n 9 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 10 of 20 PageID:\n \n1332\nsuch asthe Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they \n \nsupervise, fromperforming strip searches of pre-trial detainees who have been charged with \n \nnon-indictable offenses and civil commitments and/or who can be segregated from the general \npopulation as set forth above at Paragraph 18, unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that the arrestee isconcealing a weapon, drugs, or other contraband.\n   \n31.  The New Jersey Constitution and/or the New Jersey Strip Search Statute, N.J.S.A. \n2A:161A-1, preclude minor offenders from being strip searched. In turn, the New Jersey Civil \nRights Act (“NJCRA”), specifically N.J.S.A. 10:6-2 et seq. (c) protects New Jersey residents from \nany deprivation of constitutional rights. N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(b).,  Under the NJCRA, any person who is \ndeprived of substantive due process or equal protection rights, privileges or immunities secured by \nthe Constitution or laws of the State of New Jersey has a claim under State law. \n32.  Ocean County Jail is a facility whereby the County had and has the ability to create new \nand/or designate existing housing pods, and/or holding cells to segregate detainees, prior to being seen \nby a judge as described in Paragraph 18 above and/or to segregate detainees held on non-indictable \noffenses even after being seen by a judge. The County cannot be heard to say that it could not have \nobtained or designated such facilities to segregate and establish procedures such as wanding these \npersons for metal detection, and B.O.S.S. chair for invasive detection as part of the booking process for \nminor and civil detainees because the County had/has a duty to protect minor offenders and civil matter \ndetainees and as submitted infra at Count Two is prohibited from strip searching non-indictable \ndetainees even after being seen by a judge. \n33.  Under New Jersey Statutory law, specifically, N.J.S.A. 10:6-2 and N.J.S.A. \n2A:161A-1, and other applicable law, persons held on non-indictable offenses as set forth above in \nParagraph 18 cannot have been strip searched.  \n 10 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 11 of 20 PageID:\n \n1333\n34.  As such, the United States Constitution, the New Jersey Constitution, and New Jersey \napplicable statutes and laws, prohibit state officials, such as the Policy Making Defendants in this action \nand the employees they supervise, from performing strip searches of pre-trial detainees who have been \ncharged with non-indictable offenses and civil commitments as set forth above in Paragraph  18 unless \nthere is reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon, \ncontraband, or drugs.  \n35.  Upon information and belief, the County of Ocean, the Ocean County Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the Ocean County Department of Corrections, and the Policy Making Defendants, \nincluding but not limited to agents, servants, and employees, have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the \nOcean County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime \nand without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a \nweapon or contraband. \n36.  Upon information and belief, the County of Ocean, the Ocean County Sheriff's \nDepartment, the Ocean County Department of Corrections, and the Policy Making Defendants, \nincluding but not limited to agents, servants, and employees, have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the \nvaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Ocean County Jail, \nregardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged crime. For purposes of this \nComplaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as “strip searches.” \n37.  The County of Ocean, the Ocean County Sheriff's Department, the Ocean County \nDepartment of Corrections, and the Policy Making Defendants, including but not limited to agents, \nservants, and employees, know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a \n 11 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 12 of 20 PageID:\n \n1334\npolicy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion. Upon \ninformation and belief, the Ocean County's written policy was based on the policy promulgated by \nthe Ocean County Sheriff’s Department and/or the Ocean County Department of Corrections. \n38.  The Defendants' written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nblanket strip searches of all pre-trial non-indictable detainees and civil commitments has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n39.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the particular \ncircumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the particular \ncharacteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n40.  Upon information and belief, the County of Ocean, the Ocean County Sheriff's \nDepartment, the Ocean County Department of Corrections, and Policy Making Defendants, \nincluding agents, servants, and employees, have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed \nto rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all individuals \nplaced into the custody of the Ocean County Jail without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, \nor indeed suspicion of any sort in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, the New Jersey Constitution, and/or applicable Statutes or laws. This written and/or \nde facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trialdetainees routine; neither the nature of the \n \noffense charged or civil matter, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a \nparticular arrest or detainment were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom \nof routine strip searches. \n41.  Pursuant to this written and/or defacto policy and/or practice, each member of the \nclass, including every named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into \nthe Ocean County Jail. These searches were conducted without inquiry into or observation of or \n 12 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 13 of 20 PageID:\n \n1335\nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause. Strip searches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among other innocuous \noffenses such as, unpaid parking tickets, traffic violations, outstanding traffic fines, civil matters \nand other non-indictable offenses as set forth in Paragraph 18 above. \n42.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to \nthis written and/or de facto policy and/or practice, the victims of the unlawful strip searches, each \nmember of the Class including every named Plaintiff, has suffered or will suffer psychological \npain,humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\n   \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs\n \n43.  Plaintiffs’ experiences are representative and corroborative of what the members of \nthe Class were subjected to.\n \n44.  Plaintiff Edward Bizzarro is, and at all times relevant thereto has been, a resident of \nthe State of New Jersey, domiciled in Manahawkin, New Jersey. In September 2007, Plaintiff was \narrested for failing to pay child support. He wastransported to the Ocean County Jail where he \n \nwas strip searched. Plaintiff was humiliated and degraded by these illegal, unconstitutional \nacts. The strip search occurred prior to Mr. Bizzarro being seen by a judge. Mr. Bizzarro’s \nrelease amount was $300.00.

Ms. Wedding \nwas humiliated and degraded by these illegal, unconstitutional acts. The strip search occurred \nprior to Ms. Wedding being seen by a judge. Ms. Wedding was released within two days when \nher bail in the amount of $431 was paid. \n \n47.  Bizzarro, Wright and Wedding were strip searched according to the policy and \npractice of the Ocean County Jail, without reasonable suspicion that they were carrying \ncontraband, drugs and/or weapons or any illicit items. \n48.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff's Department policy, practice and custom, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION  \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\n \nViolation of the United States and New Jersey Constitutions  \nUnder the Color of State Law\n \n—Unreasonable Searches and Failure to Implement Policies and Practices to Avoid\n \nConstitutional Deprivation under Color of State Law— \n49.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated \nin thepreceding paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein. \n \n50.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as enforced under 42 \n 14 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 15 of 20 PageID:\n \n1337\nU.S.C. §1983, and the New Jersey Constitution, Article I, ¶7, as enforced by the NJCRA, \nN.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c), as well as the New Jersey Strip Search Statute, N.J.S.A. 2A:161A-1, \nprotects citizens from unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits \nofficers from conducting stripsearches of individuals arrested for non-indictable offenses or \n \nviolations as set forth above in Paragraph 18, prior to these detainees being seen by a judge, absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons.\n \n51.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ and the Class’s rights \nunder the United States Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively or subjectively reasonable \nfor Ocean County Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiffs and class members based on their \narrests and detainments for non-indictable/violation charges as set forth above in Paragraph 18. It \nwas also not objectively or subjectively reasonable for Warden Hutler, Chief Mueller, and the \nPolicy Making Defendants to order/direct Ocean County Corrections Officers/personnel to conduct \nsuch searches or to have a policy or practice permitting such searches and/or the agents or \nemployees of the Ocean County Jail to conduct said strip searches. \n52.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of the \nCounty of Ocean, Ocean County Sheriff's Department, and the Ocean County Department of \nCorrections. As such, the Defendants are directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the class. \n53.  Upon information and belief, Warden Hutler, Chief Mueller, and the Policy Making \nDefendants, and/or others including but not limited to agents, servants, and employees, are \nresponsible for establishing the policies, practices, and procedures to be utilized in the operation of \nthe Ocean County Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of the strip search policy and/or \n 15 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 16 of 20 PageID:\n \n1338\npractices questioned in this lawsuit. As such, Warden Hutler, Chief Mueller, and the Policy Making \nDefendants and/or others including but not limited to agents, servants, and employees, are each \nindividually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of the class. \n54.  Warden Hutler, Chief Mueller, and the Policy Making Defendants and/or others \nknew and/or should have known that the Ocean County Jail’s strip search policy and practices were \nillegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and members \nof the class of their constitutional rights as well as acted in a grossly negligent or negligent manner. \n55.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nand N.J.S.A. 10:6-2, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n56.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs and the c Class have been irreparably injured and are entitled to the relief set forth below. \nWHEREFORE Plaintiffs state a cause of action under the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution, as enforced under 42 U.S.C. §1983, and the New Jersey Constitution, \nArticle I, ¶7, as enforced by the NJCRA, N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c), as well as the New Jersey Strip \nSearch Statute, N.J.S.A. 2A:161A-1. \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \nViolation of Statutory Rights under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act \n57.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nthe preceding paragraphs, as though fully set forth herein. \n58.  The NJCRA, particularly, N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c), provides a right of action for any \ncitizen who is deprived of any substantive due process or equal protection rights, privileges or \n 16 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 17 of 20 PageID:\n \n1339\nimmunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States or by the Constitution or laws \nof the State of New Jersey, or whose exercise or enjoyment of those substantive rights, privileges or \nimmunities has been interfered with or attempted to be interfered with, by threats, intimidation or \ncoercion by a person acting under color of law. \n59.  The actions of the Defendants as detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ and the class’s \nrights under the New Jersey Strip Search Statute, N.J.S.A. 2A:161A-1 et seq and the Attorney \nGeneral Guidelines. It was not objectively or subjectively reasonable for the Corrections \nDivision/OCJ’s personnel to strip-search Plaintiffs and all the members of the class based on their \narrests and detainments for non-indictable offenses as set forth above at Paragraph 18. The Strip \nSearch Statute delegates to the New Jersey Attorney General authority to issue strip search \nguidelines. N.J.S.A. 2A:161A-8b.  \n60.  The guidelines for strip searching detainees are directed at persons not arrested for \ncrimes, and so includes all persons as identified in the Class Definition above at Paragraph 18, all \npersons arrested/detained on non-indictable matters and civil matters who were strip searched both \nprior to and after being seen by a judge. Under New Jersey State law, including the Attorney General \nGuidelines an Officer in Charge must authorize the strip search and there must be a search warrant \nand/or voluntary consent or reasonable suspicion the person is concealing a weapon, contraband, or \nCDS. \n61.  Therefore, it was not objectively or subjectively reasonable for the Policy Making \nDefendants to have a blanket policy ordering/directing/training Correctional Department personnel to \nconduct such searches on detainees held on non-indictable matters absent a commanding officer’s \nauthorization upon a warrant, consent, or reasonable suspicion. \n 17 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 18 of 20 PageID:\n \n1340\n62.  The Plaintiffs and the Class were strip-searched pursuant to a policy, custom or \npractice of Ocean County and the Policy Making Defendants including but not limited to agents, \nservants, employees. As such, these Defendants are directly liable for the damages of the Plaintiffs \nand the Class. \n63.  Upon information and belief, Ocean County and its agents or employees, Warden \nHutler, Chief Mueller, and the Policy Making Defendants are responsible for establishing the \npolicies, practices, and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Corrections Division/OCJ \nand are responsible for the implementation of the strip-search policy questioned in this lawsuit. \n64.  Ocean County and its agents or employees, Warden Hutler, Chief Mueller, and the \nPolicy Making Defendants knew that the above described strip-search policy was illegal and \nunconstitutional, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and \nthe members of the c Class of their Statutory rights as well as acted in a grossly negligent or \nnegligent manner. \n65.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs and the class have been irreparably injured and seek damages, as well as the declaratory \nrelief set out immediately below in the Prayer for Relief. \nWHEREFORE Plaintiffs state a cause of action under NJCRA, N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 et seq., for \nstatutory violations and other applicable laws.  \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n66.  The actions of the Defendants and Policy Making Defendants detailed herein are \nwillful and wanton, for past and continued propagations of illegal strip searches and an illegal strip \nsearch policy.  \n 18 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 19 of 20 PageID:\n \n1341\n67.  It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Ocean, the Ocean \nCounty Sheriff's Department, and the Ocean County Department of Corrections have little or no \nrespect for the civil rights of individual citizens or for the rule of law. Consequently, an award of \npunitive damages is necessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to \nthem that the requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government officials in \nOcean County. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n68.  The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff s Edward Bizzarro, Richard Wright, and April Wedding, on behalf \nof themselves and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court \nand/or jury, where appropriate, grant the following relief: \nA.  An order continuing to certify this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs’ claims \ndetailed herein, awarding compensatory damages and punitive damages to Plaintiffs \nand each member of the Class in an amount to be determined by a jury and/or this \nCourt on an individual and/or a class wide basis pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983 and \nN.J.S.A. 10:6-1 et seq. and other applicable federal and state law. \nC.  A judgment against each named Defendant, individually, awarding \ncompensatory damages and punitive damages to Plaintiffs and each member of the \n 19 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 87     Filed 03/27/14     Page 20 of 20 PageID:\n \n1342\nClass in amount to be determined by a jury and/or this court on an individual and/or a \nclass wide basis pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983 and N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 et seq. and other \napplicable federal and state law. \nD.  A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the County of Ocean \nand the Ocean County Sheriff’s Department's policy, practice and custom of strip and \nvisual cavity searching all detainees entering the Ocean County Jail, regardless of the \ncrime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nE.  A monetary award for attorney's fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988, N.J.S.A. 10:6-2, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, and N.J. Rule 4:32-1 et seq. \nwhere applicable. \nF.

The Defendants are Ocean County\nSheriff’s Department, Ocean County Department of Corrections, Theodore J. Hutler, Jr., both\nindividually and in his official capacity as the Warden of the Ocean County Correctional Facility,\nand Sandra Mueller, Chief of Corrections of the Ocean County Jail (collectively “Defendants”). \nEssentially, Plaintiffs allege that the members of the proposed class, arrested for non-indictable\noffenses, such as failure to pay child support and traffic fines, were illegally and\nunconstitutionally required to undress for inspection in violation of their right to privacy under\nthe United States and New Jersey Constitutions.  Presently before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion\nto Certify the Class pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3), or alternatively, 23(b)(2).  The parties\n\nappeared before the Court on June 2, 2009 for oral argument and in a conference in chambers\nreached agreement on several issues.  Further, the parties participated in a conference call with\nthe Court on June 9, 2009.  Based on the representations and agreements of the parties and for\nthe reasons stated herein, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion, as modified herein.\nI.   Procedural History\nOn November 28, 2007, Plaintiffs Jose Garcia, Wesley K. Bell, Edward Bizzarro, and\nRichard Wright (collectively “Original Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendants.  On\nJanuary 11, 2008, Original Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint against Defendants.  On\nJanuary 14, 2008, April Wedding was added as a plaintiff.  By Order, dated June 5, 2008,\nPlaintiffs Jose Garcia and Wesley Bell (deceased) were dismissed from the action.  Plaintiffs\nfiled their Second Amended Complaint (“Complaint”) against Defendants on September 15,\n2008.  On October 18, 2008, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to Certify Class.  This Court has\nfederal question subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and supplemental\njurisdiction over the state law claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  For the reasons stated herein,\nthe Court grants the motion and certifies the class, as limited by the parties, under 23(b)(3); the\nPlaintiffs concede that their request for injunctive relief is moot, as Defendants have adopted a\nwritten policy with respect to the changing of inmates, that they no longer seek injunctive relief\nat this juncture, and have agreed to narrow the class period, to beginning on November 28, 2005\nand extending to December 28, 2007.  The Court directs Plaintiffs to file a Third Amended\nComplaint consistent with the Court’s ruling, i.e. the class as defined within the time period and\nreflecting the modified request for relief, within twenty (20) days.  \n2\n\nII.   Background\nA.  Facts Relating to Plaintiffs’ Arrests, Detentions, and Alleged Strip Searches\n1.   April Wedding’s Testimony\nIn August 2007, while driving her car, April Wedding was pulled over for a moving\nviolation by a Little Egg Harbor police officer.  Elmer Robert Keach, III, Aff. (Keach Aff.), Ex.\nE, April Wedding Dep. (“Wedding Dep.”), July 25, 2008, 5:21-22, 6:14-18.  Although Ms.\nWedding did not recall why the officer pulled her over, after she provided her licence,\nregistration and insurance card, the officer told her that she had an outstanding warrant for failure\nto pay a traffic fine of $431.  Id. 8:4-20, 12:18-23.  The officer arrested Ms. Wedding because she\nwas delinquent in paying a ticket she received for careless driving, N.J.S.A. 39:4-97, which is not\nan indictable offense.  Id. 5:14-6:13.  When Ms. Wedding was transported to the Ocean County\nJail, she was escorted to the booking desk and gave personal information to the booking officer. \nAfter she told the officer that she could not make bail, she was allegedly strip searched.1  Compl.\n¶ 8; Wedding Dep. 22:12-14.\nA female officer took Ms. Wedding to the shower room located adjacent to the booking\ndesk and semi-closed the curtain – separating this room from the booking area – behind the two\nof them.  Wedding Dep. 16:25-17:11, 18:9-10.  The officer directed Ms. Wedding to take off her\njewelry, including her earrings, lip ring, and tongue ring.  Id. 18:17-19:10.  Then, the officer\n1New Jersey law defines a strip search as “the removal or rearrangement of clothing for\nthe purpose of visual inspection of the person's undergarments, buttocks, anus, genitals or\nbreasts.” N.J.S.A. § 2A:161A-3.  However, this definition is not binding on the Court for the\npurpose of determining the constitutionality of an alleged strip search.  See Florence v. Bd. of\nChosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, No. 05-3619, 2008 WL 800970, at *1, n. 2\n(D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2008).\n3\n\ninstructed Ms. Wedding to take off all of her clothes, including her undergarments.  Id. 19:6-16. \nFrom about three feet away, the officer inspected Ms. Wedding’s clothes and gave her back her\nunderwear, but not her bra, which had a wire in it, and thus, was not permitted inside the facility. \nId. 19:17-14.  While nude, the officer told Ms. Wedding to turn around, bend over, then squat\nand cough, and she was also asked to lift her breasts.  Id. 19:15-18, 21:1-2.  At some point during\nthis search, the officer also checked Ms. Wedding’s mouth.  Id. 19:19-25.  After Plaintiff\ncomplied with all of the officer’s requests, she was permitted to put on her underwear and the\nprison uniform.  Id. 23:17-24:1.  The officer never physically touched Ms. Wedding during this\nchanging process, which lasted about five minutes.  Id. 21:3-12, 23:12-16.2  Ms. Wedding was\nheld at the Ocean Jail for two days and was released when her mother posted bail for her.  Id.\n27:21-28:9, 29:9-22, 30:13-31:2.  Ms. Wedding also testified that although she had never\npreviously been in a jail cell, she thought she had been detained in a holding room in Little Egg\nHarbor, Tuckerton, Stafford, and Barnegat based on other traffic violations.  Id. 34:7-36:10. \n2.   Richard Wright’s Testimony\nOn October 1, 2007, Richard Wright (“Mr. Wright”) turned himself in to “detectives” in\nToms River for failure to pay child support.  Keach Aff., Ex. F, Richard Wright Dep. (“Wright\nDep.”), July 25, 2008, 6:18-19, 7:8-11.  Mr. Wright testified that the warrant for his arrest, issued\non September 12, 2007, stated that he owed $5,129.58.  Id. 8:4-10.  Mr. Wright was taken to the\nOcean County Jail, where he was escorted through the basement sally-port entrance to the\nbooking area.  Id.  8:21-23, 9:23-10:12.  There he provided information to the booking officer\n2Ms. Wedding testified that she was not given or does not remember receiving a\ndelousing agent; it is unclear if she understood the question, but she did state that she “didn’t get\nany lice stuff or anything else.”  Id. 21:7-12, 22:20-23:11.\n4\n\nand told him that he was planning on posting the $100 bail.  Id. 10:24-11:14.  Mr. Wright\ntestified that he was not permitted to make a phone call until after he was changed.  Id. 12:20-25. \nA male officer brought Mr. Wright to “the changing room,” which was adjacent to the\nbooking area and consisted of a shower and a sink area.  Id. 13:3-20, 16:12-14.  Mr. Wright\ntestified that although the doorway to the changing room had a curtain on it, the curtain remained\nopen during his entire changing process.  Id. 13:21-14:3.  The officer directed Mr. Wright to\nremove all of his clothes, including his underwear, id. 14:6-15, and the officer checked his\nclothes.  As directed, Mr. Wright opened his mouth, and lifted his tongue.  Id. 14:16-18, 15:17-\n20.  The officer instructed Mr. Wright to “lift [his] scrotum sacs,” then “turn around, put [his]\nhands on the wall and then [he] was told to lift [his] feet in the air, one at a time and then [he]\nwas told to spread his buttocks.”  Id. 16:2-3, 15-20.  As Mr. Wright complied with all of the\nofficer’s instructions, the officer remained in close proximity, observing him.  Id. 15:21-16:1. \nThereafter, Mr. Wright was permitted to put on the prison uniform and slippers.  Id. 17:14-22. \nThen, Mr. Wright was permitted to call his girlfriend, who brought the money to the child\nsupport collection office in Toms River the same day.  Id. 11:15-12:10, 19:18-20:4. \nApproximately twelve hours after Mr. Wright’s arrest, he made bail and was released.  Id. 20:22-\n21:8.  Prior to this arrest, Mr. Wright estimated that he had been in the Ocean County Jail\ntimes for offenses, such as failure to pay child support and resisting arrest.  Id. 23:21-24:18.  Mr.\nWright served eleven months in jail in 2005 or 2006 for resisting arrest.  Id.  25:17-22, 26:5-6.  \n3.  Edward Bizzarro’s Testimony\nAfter work on September 6, 2007, Edward Bizzarro (“Mr. Bizzarro”) was arrested at his\nhome by several Ocean County sheriffs for failure to pay child support.  Affirmation of Elmer\n5\n\nRobert Keach, III, Ex. G, Edward Bizzarro Dep. (“Bizzarro Dep.”), September 23, 2008, 10:20-\n11:7, 29:2-12, 30:8-10.  Mr. Bizzarro was taken to the booking area at the Ocean County Jail , id.\n16:13-17:6, where he waited on a bench for about a half hour before he was taken to the\nchanging room.  Id. 18:11-23.  Mr. Bizzarro testified that he was taken to change before he\nprovided his personal information to the booking officer.  Id. 18:24-19:11.  \nMr. Bizzarro described the changing room as an area separate from the booking area with\na shower stall and a curtain.  Id. 18:24-19:17.  Mr. Bizzarro was directed to stand against the\nwall, remove all of his clothes, including his underwear, lift his genitals so his “private area”\ncould be checked, then bend over, spread his cheeks, and cough so the officer could check his\n“anal area” and look up his rectum.  Id. 20:21-21:11, 22:6-10, 23:9-12.  As Mr. Bizzarro\ncomplied with the all of the officer’s requests, the officer inspected him from about four feet\naway.  Id. 21:25-22:5.  The officer also instructed Mr. Bizzarro to lift his feet, id. 23:6-7, and\nopen his mouth and the officer stepped closer to look inside.  Id. 22:11-19.  After the officer\nchecked his clothes, id.  21:12-19, and finished the visual inspection, the officer gave Mr.\nBizzarro back his underwear and provided him with a prison uniform to put on as well as a pair\nof flip-flops.  Id. 24:2-12.  After he put on the uniform, Mr. Bizzarro was given a property sheet\nto record the list of items the Ocean County Jail retained.  Id. 25:11-15.  \nMr. Bizzarro again waited on the bench to be photographed before he was taken to a\ncrowded holding cell.  Id.  26:18-28:2.  Mr. Bizzarro testified that he was held for a week on that\noffense before he was released, id. 32:7-16,3 and may have been incarcerated in the Ocean\n3Although there is some indication that Judge Francis R. Hodgson signed an Ocean\nCounty Superior Court, Probation Division, Child Support, Release Amount Order for Mr.\nBizzarro on September 7, 2007 stating the Mr. Bizzarro needed to pay $300 to probation by\n6\n\nCounty Jail 100 times for failure to pay child support.  Id. 8:5-13.  \nB.  Evidence in the Record: Ocean County Jail’s Procedures\nThe parties attached several documents and deposition transcripts relating to Defendants’\nintake policies and procedures to their moving papers.  The Court will briefly summarize some of\nthis evidence as it relates directly to Plaintiffs’ class action allegations.\nThe Ocean County Department of Corrections Policy 9.03 titled “Physical Searches”\ncontains Ocean County’s inmate searching procedures.  Affirmation of Elmer Robert Keach, III,\nEx. D.  Section 9.03-.04 states that “[a] person who has been detained or arrested for commission\nof an offense other than a crime and who is confined in this facility shall not be subject to a strip\nsearch unless there is reasonable suspicion that a weapon, controlled dangerous substance, or\ncontraband will be found.”  Further, this section states that “[i]f there is reasonable suspicion,\nthis suspicion must be documented prior to the strip search taking place.”  Policy Searches,\nSection 9.03A.  In addition, before the search is conducted, it must be “approved by the Officer-\nin-Charge.”  Id.  If these criteria are not met, the prisoner should only be visually observed in\ntheir undergarments.  Id.\nSimilarly, the New Jersey Administrative Code 10A:31-8.4 states that “[a] person who\nhas been detained or arrested for commission of an offense other than a crime and who is\nconfined in an adult correctional facility shall not be subject to a strip search unless there is\nreasonable suspicion that a weapon, controlled dangerous substance or contraband will be\nMonday, September 10, 2007, Bizzarro Dep. 32:19-25, 37:1-10, 38:6-10, there is no such\nevidence in the current record before the Court.  Moreover, even if true, it is not relevant on this\nmotion.\n7\n\nfound.”  In addition, N.J.A.C. 10A:31-8.5(b)(6) states that strip searches may be conducted\n“whenever the person admitted for a minor offense(s) is known to have a history of violent or\nassaultive conduct or a previous conviction(s) for a crime.”4  \nLieutenant Anthony Spina (“Lt. Spina”), who oversees booking and classification of\ninmates entering the Ocean County Jail, testified as a representative of Ocean County in\naccordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) in this case.  At the time he testified to the Ocean\nCounty Jail’s procedures for newly admitted inmates, Lt. Spina had worked for Ocean County in\nthe Department of Corrections for 23 years and 11 months.  Lieutenant Anthony Spina Dep. (“Lt.\nSpina Dep.”), July 18, 2008, 101:16-19.  Lt. Spina explained that a newly admitted “prisoner is\nescorted up to the booking desk by a police officer and their paperwork is presented to one of the\nbooking officers.”  Id. 76:15-18.  The booking officer makes sure that the prisoner is mentally fit\nfor incarceration, pats down the inmate, removes the restraints, and begins to process that person. \nId.  76:20-77:2.  According to Lt. Spina, at that point, the prisoner is asked if he or she can post\nbail and are given an opportunity to do so before the inmate is required to change into the prison\nuniform, a process known as “changing the inmate”.  Id. 77:3-17, 150:24-151:17. \nLt. Spina described the place where inmates change or strip as a changing area with a\nbench seat on the wall to the left and two showers on the right.  Id. 97:2-21.  This area is\nseparated from the property room and the booking desk by a curtain.  Id.  Lt. Spina\nacknowledged that all pretrial detainees, irrespective of whether the arrestee was charged with an\nindictable or non-indictable offense, who are changed into the prison uniform, were required to\n4According to Defendants, the Ocean County Jail policies mirror the New Jersey\nAdministrative Code.\n8\n\ncompletely remove all of their clothing, including undergarments, while an officer had an\nopportunity to visually observe them.  Id. 152:1-153:1.  These inmates, regardless of whether\nreasonable suspicion existed, were brought into the changing area and instructed to remove all of\ntheir clothing for inspection.  Id. 136:1-12, 139:24-140:20.  According to Lt. Spina, an officer\ndirects the inmate to first strip down to his or her undergarments, and then remove his underwear\nso that the officer may inspect the waistband for concealed objects.  Id. 139:7-141:1.  Similarly, a\nfemale inmate’s brassiere is also inspected.  Id.  This disrobing procedure was conducted on all\ndetainees without regard to any individual factors, id. 149:20-150:23, such as the inmate’s\ncharge, prior institutional history or criminal history, or whether there was any reason to believe\nthat the inmate was concealing contraband.  Id. 152:11-153:1.  \nLt. Spina drew a distinction between this visual observation conducted while changing\nthe inmate, which is used for inmates arrested for non-indictable offenses, and more thorough\nstrip searches, which are used when the charge is an indictable offense.  Lt. Spina stated that\nwhen changing the inmate, the officers were “not instructed to observe them or do an inspection\nof them, they are instructed to remove their clothing and issue them jail garb.  They are not\ninstructed to do any kind of search of their naked body or anything like that.”  Id. 144:1-17.5  On\nthe other hand, inmates who are charged with indictable offenses are subjected to a full strip\nsearch, including a thorough search and visual inspection of body cavities, namely detainees must\nopen their mouths, lift their arms, and manipulate their genitalia, bend down, squat, and cough\nfor inspection of the genital and anal areas.  Id. 98:16-100:5.  Some inmates are even asked “to\n5Defendants concede that “the corrections officer stays in the room and makes visual\nobservations of the inmate’s body, looking for scars, tattoos, signs of infection or infestation,\netc.” while the prisoner stands in his or her undergarments.  Df. Opp. at 9.  \n9\n\nlift the penis separate from the testicles in order to inspect that area” during a thorough strip\nsearch.  Id. 99:15-100:5.  \nLt. Spina admitted that there is no description of a strip search in Ocean County Jail’s\npolicy, that its written policy on strip searches is confusing, and that there has been no formal\ntraining, nor outlines or programs in place to train the officers about the requirements of these\nsearches.  Id. 100:6-23, 235:7-236:16; Ex. D.  Further, the Physical Search policy requires that\n“any person received from any jurisdiction to be remanded to this institution . . . shall be strip\nsearched before being sent to the housing floor or any designated housing.”  Ex. D at 21-22; Lt.\nSpina Dep. 244:9-17.  Interestingly, Lt. Spina confirmed that both the strip searches and\n“clothing exchanges” occur in the same shower area, which is commonly referred to as the “strip\nsearch area or strip search room.”  Lt. Spina Dep. 136:14-137:24.\nToward the end of 2007, after hearing that class action lawsuits were filed against other\ncounties in New Jersey, id. 130:16-131:4, Lt. Spina recommended that Ocean County Jail install\nan opaque “privacy” curtain in one of the shower stalls in the changing area.  Id. 121:10-124:23,\n126:17-24.  This curtain was added to one of the shower stalls by removing the full curtain used\nfor showers and replacing it with a shorter curtain that enabled officers to see prisoners’ heads\nand everything from their thighs down.  Id. 127:3-12.  Lt. Spina decided to install the curtain to\n“get away from the perception that the [non-indictable] inmates were being strip searched,” id.\n122:19-123:14, when they were not subject to the full strip search process, such as manipulating\ntheir genitals, lifting their breasts, bending down, spreading the cheeks of their butt and\n10\n\ncoughing.  Id. 121:11-123:11.6  However, he said that he was not aware of any detainees who had\never made complaints to corrections officers that they were strip searched.  Id. 123:12-24.  After\nthe curtain was installed, pretrial detainees, who were arrested for non-indictable offenses, were\nno longer required to completely disrobe in front of a corrections officer of the same sex for\nvisual observation or inspection of his or her undergarments.  Rather, the inmate would be\nafforded privacy behind the curtain while the officer could still monitor the inmate during the\nclothing change.\nIn their Opposition, Defendants also included partial testimony from Officers Christopher\nLarney, Jessica Clayton, and William Thompson to support their position that inmates arrested\nfor non-indictable offenses were not subjected to full strip searches.7  Moreover, Defendants\ncontend that the Ocean County Jail did not have a policy that officers direct inmates to remove\ntheir undergarments during the changing process prior to the privacy curtain’s installation in\nNovember of 2007.  First, Defendants offer the testimony of Officer Chistopher Larney (“Ofc.\nLarney”).8  Ofc. Larney testified that inmates entering Ocean County Jail are classified based on\n6Even though Lt. Spina testified that he was not sure exactly when the curtain was\ninstalled, Id. 121:10-122:15, both parties use November 2007 as the time when the curtain was\ninstalled.  Thus, for the purposes of this motion, the Court does the same.  In an effort to include\nall potential class members, the parties agree that the class should close on December 28, 2007,\napproximately one month after the curtain was installed.\n7At this stage of the litigation, these factual inconsistencies with Plaintiffs’ and Lt.\nSpina’s testimony need not be addressed; although Defendants appear to dispute how the\nchanging process was carried out through the testimony from these three officers, on the record\nbefore the Court, there is evidence of disrobing.  See Part III, infra.\n8Mr. Bizzarro was unable to name the changing officer in his deposition; Defendants\nassert that the name of the changing officer – Officer Christopher Larney – is contained on the\ninmate’s personal property record.  Df. Opp. at 6 n. 5.  This issue of whether Officer Larney was\nMr. Bizzarro’s changing officer need not be addressed on this motion and will not be further\n11\n\ntheir charge as temporarily confined (“TC”) or non-indictable offenses, and lawfully confined or\nindictable offenses.  R. Scott Clayton Cert., Ex. A, Officer Christopher Larney Dep. (“Ofc.\nLarney Dep.”), Sept. 23, 2008, 23:25-25:9.  Ofc. Larney testified that when he changes a TC\ninmate, he does not require the inmate to remove all of his clothing; instead, he has the inmate\nstrip down to his underwear, and provides the inmate with a prison uniform.  Id. 48:3-49:24,\n57:5-24.  He also testified that the TC inmates were afforded privacy in November 2007 when a\npartial curtain was installed and these inmates were permitted to stand behind the curtain when\nthey changed into the prison uniforms.  Id. 70:3-9.\nSecond, Defendants offer the testimony from Officer Jessica Clayton (“Ofc. Clayton”). \nOfc. Clayton described the changing area as a room – separated from the booking area by a full-\nlength curtain in a doorway – that consists of two shower stalls, one used for showers and the\nother used for changing TC inmates.  R. Scott Clayton Cert., Ex. B, Officer Jessica Clayton Dep.\n(“Ofc. Clayton Dep.”), Sept. 23, 2008, 47:2-48:16.  According to Officer Clayton, prior to the\ninstallation of the privacy curtain, a female prisoner went behind the main curtain with the\nchanging officer and she had the choice to face the wall (away from the changing officer) and\ncould keep her bra and underwear on, so her private areas were not exposed.  Id. 48:25-49:25. \nHowever, Ofc. Clayton stated that if the brassiere contained an underwire, it would be withheld\nor the wire would be removed prior to returning it to the inmate.  Id. 16:20-17:13.9  Since the\ncurtain was added, the inmates “go behind a curtain, which is next to the one shower stall, and\naddressed by the Court here.\n9The Court notes that if the female inmate’s bra had an underwire, then according to Ofc.\nClayton’s testimony, prior to the installation of the privacy curtain, the inmate would have to\nremove at least some of her undergarments.\n12\n\nthey’re instructed to hand out each piece of clothing.  It’s inspected.  Whatever they are allowed\nto keep is given back to them along with a uniform and a pair of shower shoes.”  Id. 47:2-10.\nLast, Defendants offer excerpts from the testimony of Officer William Thompson (“Ofc.\nThompson”).  Ofc. Thompson testified that prior to the installation of the curtain in November\n2007, he would direct a TC inmate to stand in the middle of the changing room and strip down to\nhis underwear.  R. Scott Clayton Cert., Ex. C, Officer William Thompson Dep. (“Ofc. Thompson\nDep.”), Sept. 23, 2008, 30:4-14.  Since the curtain was installed, Ofc. Thompson directs TC\ninmates to stand behind the curtain when changing into the prison uniform.  Id. 38:3-22. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Class Action Allegations\nPlaintiffs claim that the procedures described in the preceding paragraphs, before the\ninstallation of the partial curtain in November 2007, amount to strip searches even if the\nprocedures involve a so-called “visual observation” or even if the written policy facially\ncomplied with New Jersey’s strip searching rules.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants “have\ninstituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom, or practice of strip searching all individuals\nwho enter the custody of the Ocean County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the\nnature of their charged crime and absent reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was\nconcealing a weapon or contraband.”  Compl. ¶ 32.  Thus, according to Plaintiffs, each member\nof the class was the “victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the Ocean County Jail.” \nId. ¶ 38.  Moreover, Plaintiffs assert that these searches were conducted on individuals arrested\nfor non-indictable offenses without any inquiry into or establishment of reasonable suspicion.  Id. \nThus, Plaintiffs allege that the intake procedures violate the Fourth Amendment of the United\n13\n\nStates Constitution, which is made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,\nand New Jersey law, N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c).  Id. ¶¶ 25, 30, 55\nPlaintiffs now move to certify their class action claim.  They define their proposed class\nas follows:\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the Ocean County Jail\nafter being charged with non-indictable offenses such as disorderly persons offenses,\ntraffic infractions, and/or civil commitments and were strip searched upon their entry into\nthe Ocean County Jail.  The class period commences on November 28, 2005 and extends\nto the date on which the Ocean County Sheriff’s Department and/or the County of Ocean\nare enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice\nand custom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically\nexcluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal\nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.\nCompl. ¶ 16.  Plaintiffs allege that there are hundreds of people – approximately 4,000 in the\nproposed class – arrested for misdemeanors, traffic warrants, failure to pay child support, and\nother violations, who were all unconstitutionally strip searched due to Defendants’ policies and\nprocedures.  Id. ¶¶ 18, 20.  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants conducted these strip searches\nabsent reasonable suspicion.  Id. ¶ 20.  Thus, Plaintiffs claim that “Defendants’ written and/or de\nfacto policy of strip searching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and\ncommitted to the Ocean County Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution” and the Constitution of New Jersey.  Id. ¶¶ 26, 55.  In their\nComplaint, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief as well as money damages, Id. ¶¶ 24,\n59; however, by way of a conference call with the Court on June 9, 2009, Plaintiffs conceded that\ntheir request for injunctive relief is moot on this motion due to Defendants’ written policy with\n14\n\nrespect to the changing of inmates and no longer seek such relief.10\nDefendants oppose the class certification because: “(1) there is a predominance of\nindividual issues that precludes class certification; (2) the claims of the class representatives are\nnot necessarily typical of the class, generally; (3) due to their atypical claims, the proposed class\nrepresentatives cannot adequately represent the interests of the class; (4) the proposed class does\nnot satisfy the requirements under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b), and (5) the class definition is overly\nbroad under the circumstances presented in this case.”  Df. Opp. at 2.  Defendants do not oppose\nthe numerosity or commonality requirements.  For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants\nPlaintiffs’ motion and certifies the class under Rule 23(b)(3). \nIII.  DISCUSSION\n“To obtain class action certification, plaintiffs must establish that all four requisites of\nRule 23(a) and at least one part of Rule 23(b) are met.”  Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 55 (3d\nCir. 1994).  In considering whether certification is proper, courts refrain from inquiring into the\nmerits of the action and accept the substantive allegations in the complaint as true.  See Eisen v.\nCarlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1973).  However,\ncourts may need “to analyze the elements of the parties’ substantive claims and review facts\nrevealed in discovery in order to evaluate whether the requirements of Rule 23 have been\nsatisfied,” Wilson v. County of Gloucester, — F. Supp. 2d —, 2009 WL 805179, at *3 (D.N.J.\nMar. 30, 2009) (citations omitted), because “the class determination generally involves\n10The parties, however, agree to continue to work on the language of Defendants’ newly\nadopted policy going forward, and the necessity, if any, of a consent order being entered.\n15\n\nconsiderations that are ‘enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's cause\nof action.’”  Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351\n(1977) (citation omitted).  When certifying a class, a Court must make factual determinations\nsupporting Rule 23 findings by a preponderance of the evidence and resolve all factual or legal\ndisputes relevant to class certification, even if they overlap with the merits – including disputes\ntouching on elements of the cause of action.  In re: Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d\n305, 307 (3d Cir. 2008).  “The interests of justice require that in a doubtful case . . . any error, if\nthere is to be one, should be committed in favor of allowing class certification.”  Eisenberg v.\nGagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 785 (3d Cir. 1985).\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) provides a two-step requirement to certify a class\naction.  First, Rule 23(a) provides:\nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of\nall members only if: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or\ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class;\nand (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\nclass. \nIf the Plaintiffs satisfy Rule 23(a)’s prerequisites referred to as numerosity, commonality,\ntypicality, and adequacy of representation, see Gen. Telephone Co. Of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457\nU.S. 147, 156 (1982), then the Court must determine if the class action is maintainable under any\nof the three provisions in Rule 23(b).  As previously discussed, Plaintiffs seek certification under\nRule 23(b)(3) or, in the alternative, Rule 23(b)(2).  \nA class may be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) if “the court finds that the questions of law\nor fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only\n16\n\nindividual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and\nefficient adjudication of the controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In In re: Hydrogen Peroxide\nAntitrust Litig., the Third Circuit emphasized that “[t]he twin requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) are\nknown as predominance and superiority.”  552 F.3d at 310.  A class may be certified under\n23(b)(2) if “[t]he party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply\ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate\nrespecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  In In re: Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust\nLitig., the Third Circuit also stated that “[t]he trial court, well-positioned to decide which facts\nand legal arguments are most important to each Rule 23 requirement, possesses broad discretion\nto control proceedings and frame issues for consideration under Rule 23.”  552 F.3d at 310.\nThe Court will first discuss Defendants’ objections to the proposed class as overly broad,\nit will next consider each of Rule 23(a)’s elements in turn, and then determine whether a class\ncan be maintained under Rule 23(b).\nA.   Propriety of the Proposed Class\nAs an initial matter, the Court addresses Defendants' three objections to the proposed\nclass definition as overly broad.  First, Defendants argue that the proposed class includes\nmembers who were lawfully searched pursuant to a finding of reasonable suspicion and/ or\npursuant to 10A:31-8.5(b)(6) because the individual had a history of violent criminal behavior,\nand/or multiple incarcerations.  Df. Opp. at 24.  This argument mirrors Defendants’ argument\nagainst certification under Rule 23(a) because Plaintiffs claims are not typical of the proposed\nclass, and thus, the Court addresses them herein.  See Part II.B.3., infra.\n17\n\nSecond, Defendants contend that although the proposed class commences on November\n28, 2005 and extends to the date on which the County of Ocean is enjoined from or otherwise\nceases enforcing its allegedly unconstitutional policy and practice of conducting unlawful strip\nsearches, the Ocean County Jail “ceased the alleged unconstitutional conduct in November 2007\nwhen it installed the curtain in the clothing exchange room.”  Df. Opp. at 24.  Based on the\nparties’ representations, the Court finds that the installation of this curtain narrows the class\nperiod to those Plaintiffs, detained for non-indictable offenses, who were allegedly subjected to\nsuspicionless searches pre-curtain installation.  Plaintiffs agree to narrow the class definition to:\nAll persons who had been placed into the custody of the Ocean County Jail after being\ncharged with non-indictable offenses such as disorderly persons offenses, traffic\ninfractions, and/or civil commitments and were strip searched upon their entry into the\nOcean County Jail.  The class period commences on November 28, 2005 and extends to\nDecember 28, 2007.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all\nof their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or\nassignees.\nIn addition, Plaintiffs concede that they do not seek injunctive relief at this time.  The Court\ndirects Plaintiffs to file their Third Amended Complaint consistent with these stipulations within\ntwenty (20) days.  Further, as discussed herein, see Part II.B. & C., infra., based on the parties’\npapers and these representations, Plaintiffs satisfy the requirements of Rule 23, which is the\ninquiry on this motion. \nThird, Defendants assert that the proposed class includes individuals who may not have\nbeen subjected to a strip search.  To support their position that at least some of the inmates\narrested for non-indictable offenses were not subjected to full strip searches, Defendants offer the\ntestimony of Ofcs. Larney, Clayton, and Thompson who claim that prior to the installation of the\ncurtain, they did not require all of the non-indictable inmates to remove all of their clothing and\n18\n\nonly instructed them to strip down to their undergarments.  Thus, Defendants argue that the Court\nshould not have to go through the “grueling process of [determining the manner in which each\nindividual claimant under the proposed class was booked,] deposing each individual, looking up\nthat individual’s records to determine whom the changing officer was, and taking the sworn\ntestimony of that changing officer as a means of checking the veracity of the plaintiff[s’] claims.” \nDf. Opp. at 25.\nWhen certifying a class, a Court must make factual determinations supporting Rule 23\nfindings by a preponderance of the evidence and resolve all factual or legal disputes relevant to\nclass certification, even if they overlap with the merits-including disputes touching on elements\nof the cause of action.  In re: Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 307 (3d Cir.\n2008).  Further, “[t[he interests of justice require that in a doubtful case . . . any error, if there is\nto be one, should be committed in favor of allowing class certification.”  Eisenberg, 766 F.2d at\n785.  In this case, notwithstanding the testimony of the named officers, the testimony of\nDefendants’ Rule 30(b)(6) deponent Lt. Spina states that newly admitted inmates charged with\nnon-indictable offenses were directed to remove all of their clothing during the clothing\nexchange.  Lt. Spina acknowledged that all pretrial detainees, irrespective of whether the arrestee\nwas charged with an indictable or non-indictable offense, were required to completely disrobe\nwhile the officer had an opportunity to visually observe them.  Lt. Spina Dep. 152:1-153:1.  Even\nthough Lt. Spina drew a distinction between this visual observation conducted when changing\ninmates who were arrested for non-indictable offenses and the more thorough strip searches for\ninmates charged with an indictable offense, he admitted there is no description of a strip search in\nOcean County Jails’s policy, that its written policy on strip searches was confusing, and that there\n19\n\nwas no formal training, nor were there outlines or programs in place to train the officers about\nthe requirements of the searches.  Id. 100:6-23, 235:7-236:16; Ex. D.  \nFurthermore, Defendants admit that Lt. Spina testified that during this changing process,\nthe corrections officer stays in the room and makes visual observations of the inmate’s body,\nlooking for scars, tattoos, signs of infection or infestation, etc.  Df. Opp. at 9.  In addition, the\nPhysical Search policy requires that “any person received from any jurisdiction to be remanded to\nthis institution . . . shall be strip searched before being sent to the housing floor or any designated\nhousing.”  Ex. D at 21-22; Lt. Spina Dep. 244:9-17.  Thus, the Court concludes that by a\npreponderance of the evidence, Plaintiffs have presented evidence that Defendants had a policy\nor practice of requiring inmates to fully disrobe before receiving their jail garb prior to the\ninstallation of the curtain at the end of 2007.  Therefore, the Court is not persuaded by\nDefendants’ objections to the proposed class as overly broad.\nB.  Rule 23(a) Requirements\n1. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be “so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable[.]”  Although no single magic number exists satisfying the numerosity\nrequirement, Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, No. 05-3619,\n2008 WL 800970, at *6 (Mar. 20, 2008), the Third Circuit has previously held that the\nnumerosity requirement will generally be satisfied “if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the\npotential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40.”  Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226-27 (3d Cir.\n2001).  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that there are approximately 4,000 people in the\n20\n\nproposed class.  Id. ¶¶ 18, 20.  Defendants concede that the number of the potential plaintiffs\nexceeds forty.  Df. Opp. at 11.  Even though the size of the class not known at this time,\nDefendants do not contest the numerosity requirement.  Id.  Since all non-indictable arrestees are\nsubjected to the same intake processes, which Plaintiffs claim amount to suspicionless strip\nsearches, the proposed class likely includes several hundred if not thousands of individuals.  See\nFlorence, 2008 WL 800970, at *7.  Because joinder of such a large number of plaintiffs is\nimpracticable, Plaintiffs satisfy the numerosity requirement.\n2.  Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the class[.]”  To\nsatisfy this requirement, the named plaintiffs must show that they “share at least one question of\nfact or law with the grievances of the prospective class.”  Stewart, 275 F.3d at 227 (citation\nomitted); see also Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56 (citation omitted).  Commonality does not require\nthat members of the class share identical claims, rather the named plaintiffs’ interests need only\nbe representative of the absent class members.  In re Community Bank of N. Va., 418 F.3d 277,\n303 (3d Cir. 2005).  Further, “an allegation that the defendants’ overall policy injured the\nplaintiffs satisfies the commonality requirement.”  Florence, 2008 WL 800970, at *7 (citation\nomitted).\nIn this case, Plaintiffs have set forth a legitimate issue involving the same legal questions\nfor all plaintiffs in the proposed class:  whether requiring all pretrial detainees to completely\ndisrobe before a same sex corrections officer absent reasonable suspicion upon admittance to the\njail constitutes a blanket strip search policy that violates the Fourth Amendment and/or the New\nJersey law.  Plaintiffs allege that the proposed class members were all subjected to the uniform\n21\n\npolicy of “clothing exchanges,” which they claim involves suspicionless strip searching. \nPlaintiffs also contend that a common question of law exists as to whether there must be\nmanipulation of the genitals, a spreading fo the buttocks and (for females) nude squatting and\ncoughing for a strip search to be unconstitutional and whether these “clothing exchanges”\noccurred in lieu of a more intrusive strip search.  Defendants do not dispute that the proposed\nclass meets the commonality requirement.  All of the proposed class members challenge the\nconstitutionality of these procedures under the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. \nThus, all plaintiffs claim that they were injured in substantially the same way by the execution of\nDefendants’ allegedly unconstitutional policies or practices.  Accordingly, commonality is\nsatisfied in this case.\n3.  Typicality\nRule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical\nof the claims or defenses of the class[.]”  “The typicality inquiry centers on whether the interests\nof the named plaintiffs align with the interests of the absent members.”  Stewart, 275 F.3d at 227.\n It does not mandate that all putative class members share identical claims.  See Baby Neal, 43\nF.3d at 56.  Although the proposed class representative must “possess the same interest and\nsuffer the same injury as the class members,” Falcon, 457 U.S. at 156, “factual differences will\nnot render a claim atypical if the claim arises from the same event or practice or course of\nconduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members, and if it is based on the same legal\ntheory.”  Barnes v. The Am. Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 141 (3d Cir. 1998).\nHere, Plaintiffs allege that they were each subjected to the same changing procedures\nupon admission into the Ocean County Jail, which amounted to an unconstitutional suspicionless\n22\n\nstrip search.  This claim is precisely the same as those of the absent putative class members\nbecause all non-indictable arrestees admitted to the facility are subjected to the same intake\nprocedures, which allegedly require arrestees to completely disrobe while Defendants’ officers\nview their nude bodies – at least prior to the end of 2007.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ incentives in relation\nto this claim therefore seem to align perfectly with those of the rest of the newly defined class\nbeginning November 28, 2005 and extending to December 28, 2007.  Accordingly, the Court\nconcludes that the named Plaintiffs satisfy the typicality requirement.\nDefendants, however, argue typicality is not satisfied in this case.  Defendants do not\ncontend that the named Plaintiffs were not strip searched.  Instead, Defendants assert that their\ndefenses against the individual Plaintiffs’ claims are distinct.  Defendants note Mr. Wright and\nMr. Bizzarro had been incarcerated on several occasions prior to the one that formed the basis of\nthe instant action.11  In addition, Defendants point the Court to N.J.A.C. 10A:31-8.5(b)(6), which\nstates that strip searches may be conducted “whenever the person admitted for a minor offense(s)\nis known to have a history of violent or assaultive conduct or a previous conviction(s) for a\ncrime.”  Thus, Defendants argue that because Mr. Wright and Mr. Bizzarro had both been\narrested before, and Mr. Wright testified that he had pled guilty to a resisting arrest charge for\nwhich he had been incarcerated for eleven months, their defenses against these defenses may\ndiffer from those against Ms. Wedding or other members of the class.12 . \n11Mr. Wright had been incarcerated approximately 10 times for misdemeanor offenses,\nWright Dep. 23:21-24:4, and Mr. Bizzarro had been incarcerated about 100 times for failure to\npay child support.  Bizzarro Dep. 8:5-13.\n12Although the statute does permit officers to conduct strip searches when the person\nadmitted for a minor offense has previous conviction(s) for a crime, there is no evidence that\nDefendants knew whether or not either Mr. Wright or Mr. Bizzarro had previous convictions. \n23\n\nMs. Wedding, on the other hand, had not been incarcerated in Ocean County Jail prior to\nthe incarceration set forth in this case.  Defendants, however, argue that because Ms. Wedding\ntestified that she had lip and tongue piercings when she arrived at the jail, these piercings “may\nhave provided reason to believe that she had other piercings that were hidden by clothing, thus\nproviding reasonable suspicion to perform a strip search.”  Df. Opp. at 13 (emphasis added). \nDefendants also assert that “the issue of whether or not such circumstances provide reasonable\nsuspicion for a search does not affect the issue that the defense to Ms. Wedding’s claims vary\n[sic] significantly from those of purported class.”  Id.  The Court disagrees with Defendants’\narguments.  \nHere, Plaintiffs’ claims clearly arise out of the same practice as the other proposed class\nmembers’ claims, specifically, Defendants’ procedures that require non-indictable arrestees to\nremove all of their clothing in front of an officer.  Based upon the totality of the circumstances,\nthe officer must have reasonable suspicion to conduct such searches at the time the search was\nconducted.  See United States v. Whitted, 541 F.3d 480, 489 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing to United\nStates v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002)).  Defendants failed\nto present any evidence that the officers who conducted each of the named plaintiffs’ searches\nhad reasonable suspicion at the time of the search to conduct a strip search upon changing the\ninmate.13  Moreover, Defendants cannot create post-hoc rationales to manufacture justifications\nNor has any evidence been presented that either Mr. Wright or Mr. Bizzarro is known to have or\nhave a history of violent or assaultive conduct.  These potential defenses are not appropriate to\naddress at this stage of litigation. \n13The Court discusses the parties’ arguments regarding whether reasonable suspicion\nissues predominate over the common issues of law and fact herein.  See Part III.C.1., infra.\n24\n\nfor conducting strip searches.  The Ocean County Department of Corrections Policy Searches\nSection 9.03A specifically requires that if there is reasonable suspicion, this suspicion must be\ndocumented and approved by the Officer-in-Charge prior to the strip search taking place.  In this\ncase, there is no documentation of reasonable suspicion or approval for the strip searches\nallegedly conducted on the named Plaintiffs, and thus, Defendants’ arguments that Plaintiffs’\nclaims are not typical of the putative class are unavailing.  \nMr. Wright’s, Mr. Bizzarro’s, and Ms. Wedding’s claims are typical of the class as a\nwhole, insofar as each was instructed to completely disrobe and when completely nude was\nobserved by a corrections officer pursuant to the policies and practices pertaining to all newly\nadmitted pretrial detainees at Ocean County Jail.  Plaintiffs, and the proposed class members, all\nsuffered the same alleged invasions of privacy, which Plaintiffs claim violate federal and state\nlaw.  See Wilson, 2009 WL 805179, at *5.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the\nclass.\n4.  Adequacy\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class.”  The Third Circuit had adopted a two-pronged test for determining the\nadequacy of representation by the named Plaintiffs and their counsel:  “(a) the plaintiff's attorney\nmust be qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation, and (b) the\nplaintiff must not have interests antagonistic to those of the class.”  Wetzel v. Liberty Mut. Ins.\nCo., 508 F.2d 239, 247 (3d Cir. 1975).  The burden to prove that the representation is not\nadequate rests with the party challenging the class’ representation.  See Wilson, 2009 WL\n805179, at *6 (citations omitted).\n25\n\nIn this case, Defendants do not challenge the adequacy of class counsel.  Moreover, after\nconsidering the submissions in support of the instant motion, the Court determines that the\nproposed class counsel is “qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed\nlitigation.”  Wetzel, 508 F.2d at 247.  Defendants, however, do challenge the second-prong:\nPlaintiffs’ ability to adequately represent the putative class as the named plaintiffs.  Defendants\nargue that “the interests of the class representatives are not necessarily the same as the interests\nof the class, generally, and may be considered antagonistic to those of the class.”  Df. Opp. at 15. \nDefendants contend that the class representatives’ claims are not typical of the defined class as a\nwhole.  Most of Defendants’ arguments are merely recapitulations of those they previously\noffered in the context of typicality, which the Court previously rejected.  For example,\nDefendants argue that two of the three named Plaintiffs had previously been incarcerated and the\nremaining named Plaintiff had visible body piercings that were not permitted in the jail.  The\nCourt has already determined that these reasons do not warrant denial of class certification. \nDefendants, however, contest Plaintiffs’ representation of the putative class with respect\nto when the class should close.  Even though the County denies that any such unconstitutional\npolicy, practice, and custom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion was ever in\neffect, Defendants assert that “there is certainly no question today that since November 2007,\ninmates incarcerated for non-indictable offenses are instructed to stand behind a curtain while\nchanging into the prison uniform.”  Df. Mot. at 16.  Essentially, Defendants argue the named\nPlaintiffs do not adequately represent the putative class as defined in the Complaint because at\nthe end of 2007 the jail installed a second curtain behind which the arrestees for non-indictable\noffenses were directed to change search, and thus, any pretrial detainees after that time were\n26\n\nsubjected to a different search.  Plaintiffs concur; the parties now agree that the class should close\non December 28, 2007 and that they will continue to work on the language of the policy now in\neffect.  Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs will adequately represent the class within the\ndefined limited class period.\nC.  Rule 23(b) Requirements\n1.  Predominance\nIn In re: Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., The Third Circuit recently discussed\npredominance:\nPredominance tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant\nadjudication by representation, a standard far more demanding than the commonality\nrequirement of Rule 23(a), requiring more than a common claim.  Issues common to the\nclass must predominate over individual issues.  Because the nature of the evidence that\nwill suffice to resolve a question determines whether the question is common or\nindividual, a district court must formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will\nplay out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a\ngiven case.  If proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires individual\ntreatment, then class certification is unsuitable. \n552 F.3d at 310-11 (internal citations and quotations omitted).  The Court must “examine the\nelements of Plaintiffs’ claim through the prism of Rule 23” to determine whether Plaintiffs\nsatisfy the predominance requirement.  Id. at 311.\nPlaintiffs bear the burden of showing that the elements of their claim are “capable of\nproof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than individual to its members.” \nId. at 311-12.  “The Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches.”  Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.S. 520, 558 (1979).  If this case goes to trial, Plaintiffs will have to prove that they were\n27\n\nsearched and that search was unreasonable.  See Wilson, 2009 WL 805179, at *7.14  In this case,\nPlaintiffs assert that the putative class members’ claims involve the same legal question of\nwhether Defendants’ “policy of strip searching every pretrial detainee admitted to [Ocean County\nJail is] constitutional where these detainees are made to disrobe in the presence of a correctional\nofficer, without considering the crime charged or the circumstances of arrest.”  Pl. Mot. at 15-16. \nPlaintiffs also state that the proposed class members share the same factual question of whether\n“such practices exist[ed] during the class period.”  This Court, like many others, finds that\nPlaintiffs’ challenge to Defendants’ alleged policy or practice of using intake procedures for\nnon-indictable arrestees, which are tantamount to suspicionless strip searches, turns on\ngeneralized, not individualized, proof and thus, common issues predominate.  See, e.g., Wilson,\n2009 WL 805179, at *7; Florence, 2008 WL 800970, at *12; Johnson v. District of Columbia,\nNo. 02-2364, 2008 WL 344739, at *25-27 (D.D.C. Feb. 8, 2008).\nHere, Defendants admit that the named class representatives were all arrested and charged\nwith non-indictable offenses.  At issue in this lawsuit is whether Defendants’ blanket policies and\npractices of requiring inmates to strip their clothing in front of an officer violate federal and/ or\nstate law.  The manner in which the inmates were changed is basically the same in each instance\nbecause the observation is done pursuant to the blanket policy and practices implements by\nDefendants.  Thus, “[w]hether those policies and practices violated class members’ state or\nfederal rights is also subject to common determination insofar as the asserted invasion of privacy\nis the same: the class members’ privacy interest in keeping private their nude body and\n14Plaintiffs must also prove that Defendants are state actors for purposes of § 1983 and\nthe New Jersey Civil Rights Act, however, this does not appear to be disputed in this case.\n28\n\nmaintaining their personal dignity.”  Wilson, 2009 WL 805179, at *8 (citations omitted).  \nDefendants, however, argue that individual issues predominate, here because there are\nsignificant differences between each of Plaintiffs’ cases and those of the proposed class.  First, as\npreviously addressed by the Court, Defendants claim that there was reason to strip search both\nMr. Wright and Mr. Bizzarro pursuant to N.J.A.C. 10A:31-8.5(b)(6), and there was reasonable\nsuspicion to strip search Ms. Wedding based on her piercings.  See Part III.B.3., supra. \nDefendants argue that the Court would have to investigate the criminal records of each class\nmember to determine whether or not the search was proper under N.J.A.C. 10A:31-8.5(b)(6),15\nand also conduct separate inquiries to determine whether reasonable suspicion existed in each\ncase.  These arguments are similar to the ones raised by the defendants and previously rejected by\nthe courts in Wilson and Florence.  Essentially, Defendants, here, argue that liability will turn on\nwhether particular searches of individual arrestees were constitutionally justified. \nPlaintiffs argue that even if reasonable suspicion existed, and Plaintiffs do not concede it\ndid, these issues do not predominate over the common issues of law and fact.  Plaintiffs argue\nthat if such issues did predominate, then strip search cases could never be certified as class\nactions.  As discussed herein, based on the record, it appears that all non-indictable arrestees at\nthe Ocean County Jail are subjected to the same policies and procedures upon admittance to the\n15Plaintiffs argue that the New Jersey Administrative Code procedure could itself be\nunconstitutional.  Pl. Reply at 10 n. 6.  For support that the statute and code provisions could be\nunconstitutional, Plaintiffs cite to Ernst v. Fort Lee, 739 F. Supp. 220, 225 (D.N.J. 1990), finding\nthat the “provisions of the Fort Lee operations manual, and those sections of the Strip Search Act\nupon which it is based, do not pass muster under the Constitution to the extent that they permit\nthe indiscriminate strip search of an arrestee on a minor offense without requiring reasonable\nsuspicion that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or harboring contraband or drugs.”  Id. \nHowever, although Plaintiffs challenge Ocean County Jail’s generalized policies, they correctly\nassert that this issue is not before the Court on this motion.\n29\n\nfacility.  Like in Florence, the Court “disagrees with the notion that liability will turn on\nindividual questions relating to the justification for strip searches of particular arrestees.  Rather,\nliability will seemingly boil down to whether the intake procedures, which require Defendants’\nofficers to view the nude bodies of non-indictable arrestees, are tantamount to strip searches.” \n2008 WL 800970, at *13.  This Court, like others, must reject Defendants’ arguments – that\nliability turns on whether particular searches of particular arrestees where constitutionally\njustified – and certify this class action lawsuit involving blanket strip search policies.  See Id. at\n*12; Johnson v. District of Columbia, No. 02-2364, 2008 WL 344739, at *25-27 (D.D.C. Feb. 8,\n2008).  Only generalized proofs are required to prove Plaintiffs’ claims here.  See Florence, 2008\nWL 800970, at *13; Johnson, 2008 WL 344739, at *25-27. \n“It is not at all clear that individualized reasonable suspicion has any significant role to\nplay in this case, at least with respect to liability, because . . . the policies and practices at issue\napply without regard to individualized reasonable suspicion . . . [and] [m]ore importantly . . .\nPlaintiffs assert a facial attack on the [Defendants’] policies and practices” of blanket strip\nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.”  Wilson, 2009 WL 805179, at *8.  “Thus, if the policy is\nunconstitutional as to any member of the class, Plaintiffs will be entitled to at least some form of\nrelief, even if the policies and practices, as applied, are determined not to violate the\nconstitutional rights of some of the class members.”  Id.16  Therefore, the Court finds Defendants’\narguments that individual determinations of reasonable suspicion predominate the common\nissues to be litigated on a class-wide basis unpersuasive.  See Id.\n16Indeed, it can be determined if any class members were strip searched pursuant to the\nreasonable suspicion exception by reviewing documentation which must be filed in these\ncircumstances.  See Policy Searches, Section 9.03A.  \n30\n\nSecond, Defendants assert that individual damage issues predominate because the alleged\nindividual damages sustained by the named Plaintiffs differ.  Defendants argue that the Court\nwould need to conduct separate inquiries (or mini-trials) regarding damages for each named\nPlaintiff and each putative class member because each will have to present his own proof of\ndamages depending on the scope of the illegal search he allegedly suffered, the number of\nprevious incarcerations, and the number of times he has been incarcerated during the class\nperiod.17  While some members of the putative class may have suffered more invasive searches,\nand would therefore be entitled to greater damages than others, the Court does not find this\nargument persuasive.  The Third Circuit has held that courts have “commonly recognized that the\nnecessity for calculation of damages on an individual basis should not preclude class\ndetermination when the common issues which determine liability predominate.”  Bogosian v.\nGulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 456 (3d Cir. 1977).  Moreover, “[c]ourts routinely find\npredominance satisfied in class action strip search cases notwithstanding the possibility that an\nindividualized calculation of damages may be necessary.”  Wilson, 2009 WL 805179, at *8\n(quoting Florence, 2008 WL 800970, at *13 (citing cases)).  Thus, individual damage issues do\n17Defendants cite to Barabin v. Aramark Corp., No. 02-8057, 2003 WL 355417 (3d Cir.\nJan. 24, 2003) for support that this Court should find that individual damage claims would\npredominate over the commons issues.  In Barabin, however, the district court found and the\nThird Circuit affirmed that predominance was not satisfied because “it is clear from the\ncomplaint that while all of the plaintiffs aver that they were ‘subjected to frequent harassment\nand unjustified disciplinary sanctions by Caucasian supervisors not imposed on similarly situated\nCaucasian employees,’ the circumstances under which those acts of discrimination were\ncommitted and the resultant injuries are unique to each individual plaintiff. The plaintiffs'\nindividual claims for damages  would therefore require individualized evaluations and findings\nof the facts and defenses.”  Id. at *7-8.  Barabin differs from the instant case, where Plaintiffs\ncomplain of Defendants’ uniform or de facto policy of strip searching inmates, which does\nprovide for common issue predominance.  See, e.g., Wilson, 2009 WL 805179, at *8 (citing\nFlorence, 2008 WL 800970, at *13).\n31\n\nnot predominate here.  Accordingly, the Court finds that common issues predominate in this case.\n2.  Superiority\nHere, Defendants do not argue that a class action would not be the superior method of\nadjudicating Plaintiffs’ claims.  Rule 23(b)(3) provides a non-exhaustive list of several factors to\nhelp determine whether a class action is the superior method of adjudication:\n(A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or\ndefense of separate actions;\n(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already\nbegun by or against class members;\n(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in\nthe particular forum; and\n(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In this case, all four factors favor class certification.  For the\nfollowing reasons, the Court concludes that a class action is superior than litigation by\nindividual class members. \nPlaintiffs focus on the first factor to support their position that a class action is the\nsuperior method of proceeding with their claims.  “It is generally recognized that class\ncertification is preferred where the recovery being sought by each of the plaintiffs is not\nsufficiently large to render individualized litigation a realistic possibility.’”  Florence,\n2008 WL 800970, at *14 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Because recovery\nby each putative class member would likely be small, they have little incentive to pursue\ntheir individual claims against Defendants for their alleged unconstitutional practices. \nTwo other courts in this district have reached the same conclusion in similar “strip\n32\n\nsearch” cases.  See Wilson, 2009 WL 805179, at *9 (“Given the relatively small\neconomic stake that any one class member has in this case, the Court concludes that the\nfirst (23(b)(3)) factor favors class treatment.”) (quoting Florence, 2008 WL 800970, at\n*14).  Similarly, the Court finds that due to the nature of Plaintiffs’ claims, most of the\nproposed class members would not independently assert their claims.\nSecond, the parties have not identified, nor is the Court aware of, any other strip\nsearch litigation involving the Ocean County Jail policies and procedures at issue here. \nThus, the second factor also favors class certification.  The third factor favors class\ncertification because it is generally “desirable to litigate similar, related claims in one\nforum.”  Florence, 2008 WL 800970, at *14 (citation omitted).  Here, the Court has\ndetermined that common issues of law and fact predominate this litigation, and therefore,\njudicial interests of economy and efficiency also weigh in favor of a class action. \nMoreover, “the class action vehicle is particularly suitable when, as here, Plaintiffs seek\ninstitutional reform.”  Wilson, 2009 WL 805179, at *10.  Lastly, with respect to the\nfourth superiority factor, the Court determines that there do not appear to be any\ndifficulties in managing this case.  However, to the extent that any do exist, the Court has\nadequately remedied them by certifying the liability and damages issues separately.  See\nPart III.D., infra.  Therefore, the fourth factor also supports Plaintiffs’ contention that the\nclass action is the superior method of litigation here.  Accordingly, the Court finds that\nsuperiority is met in this case, and for the foregoing reasons, the Court will certify the\n33\n\ndamages portion of Plaintiffs’ suit under Rule 23(b)(3).18\nD.  Appointment of Class Counsel\nThe Court must appoint class counsel pursuant to Rule 23(g)(1).  As discussed\nherein, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ counsel is “qualified, experienced, and generally\nable to conduct the proposed litigation.”  Wetzel, 508 F.2d at 247.  Accordingly, the\nCourt will therefore appoint them as class counsel.\nIV.  Conclusion\nFor the reasons stated herein, the Court grants the motion and certify the class\nnow defined as between November 28, 2005 through December 28, 2007 in which\nPlaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages under Rule 23(b)(3).  The Court\ndirects Plaintiffs to file a Third Amended Complaint consistent with the Court’s ruling,\ni.e. reflecting the modified time period of the class and requested relief, within twenty\n(20) days.  The Court will issue an appropriate Order in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(c) and (g). \n18In the alternative, Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which is usually\nsatisfied in actions where Plaintiffs primarily seek injunctive relief.  Although Plaintiffs sought\ninjunctive relief in their Complaint, Plaintiffs concede that this request is not being pursued at\nthis time because Defendants have adopted a written policy with respect to the changing of\ninmates and they only pursue monetary damages here.  Because Plaintiffs no longer seek\ninjunctive relief, the Court need not address the parties’ arguments further in this connection.\n34\n\n/s/   Freda L.

Bell, Edward Bizzarro and \nRichard Wright individually and on behalf of a \nClass of others similarly situated \nPlaintiffs,  Civil Action \nv. \nOCEAN COUNTY, THEODORE J. HUTLER JR.  CLASS ACTION \nboth individually and in his official capacity as the  COMPLAINT \nWarden of the Ocean County Correctional Facility \nSANDRA MUELLER both individually and in her /':  JURY TRIAL \nofficial capacity as Chief of Corrections of the  DEMANDED \nOcean County Correctional Facility, \nDefendants. \nPlaintiffs, for their Complaint herein, allege the following on information and \nbelief except as to the allegations concerning individual claims, which are asserted upon \npersonal knowledge. \nNATURE OF ACTION \n1. Plaintiffs Jose Garcia, Wesley K. Bell, Edward Bizzarro and Richard Wright \nbring this class action individually, and on behalf of, as more particularly defined in \nparagraph 13 below, a class of all persons who were strip-searched at the Ocean County \nCorrectional Facility (hereinafter OCCF) after being held on child support warrants or \ncharged with non indictable offenses or traffic violations in contravention of their rights \nagainst unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution. \n2.  Plaintiffs seek monetary damages individually and for each member of the \nproposed class who have suffered from the wrongful actions of the Defendants described \nherein; a declaration that the Defendants' policies are unconstitutional; and, an injunction \n1 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 2 of 14\nprecluding the Defendants from continuing to violate the rights of those placed in their \ncustody or detention. \nPARTIES \n1.  Plaintiff, Jose Garcia (\"Garcia\" or \"Plaintiff') is, and at all times relevant \nhereto has been, a resident of the State of New Jersey domiciled in Toms River New \nJersey. On or about August 2007 Mr. Garcia was frisked and hand cuffed in his home for \na child support warrant.  Plaintiff was transported to the Ocean County Correctional \nFacility.  Plaintiff was illegally strip searched upon his admission to OCCF. \n2.  Plaintiff, Wesley K. Bell (\"Bell\" or \"Plaintiff') is, and at all times relevant \nhereto has been, a resident of the State of New Jersey domiciled in Manahawkin New \nJersey. On or about August 10, 2007 Mr. Bell was arrested in court for failing to execute \nan environmental protection agreement.  Plaintiff was illegally strip searched upon his \nadmission to OCCF. \n3.  Plaintiff, Edward Bizzarro (\"Bizzarro\" or \"Plaintiff') is, and at all times \nrelevant hereto has been, a resident of the State of New Jersey domiciled in Manahawkin \nNew Jersey. In or about September 2007 Mr. Bizzarro was arrested for failing to pay \nchild support.  Plaintiff was transported to the Ocean County Correctional Facility. \nPlaintiff was illegally strip searched upon his admission to OCCF. \n4.  Plaintiff, Richard Wright (\"Wright\" or \"Plaintiff') is, and at all times relevant \nhereto has been, a resident of the State of New Jersey domiciled in Toms River New \nJersey. On or about October 1, 2007 Mr. Wright turned himself in on a warrant for child \nsupport.  Plaintiff was illegally strip searched upon his admission to OCCF. \n5.  Defendant Ocean County (the \"County\") is a county government organized \nand existing under the laws of New Jersey. At all times relevant hereto, the County, \n2 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 3 of 14\nacting through its Correctional Department, was responsible for the policies, practices, \nsupervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Ocean County \nCorrectional Department and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision \nand conduct of all Ocean County Correctional Department's personnel, including those \nworking in the Ocean County Correctional Facility. In addition, at all relevant times, the \nCounty was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Ocean County Correctional \nDepartment and for ensuring that Ocean County Correctional Department's employees \nobey the Constitution and the laws of the United States and New Jersey. \n6.  Defendant Theodore J. Hutler Jr. (\"Warden Hutler\") is the Warden of the \nCorrectional Department and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of \npretrial and other detainees over which the Correctional Department exercises custodial \nor other control. Warden Hutler is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual \nand official capacities. \n7.  Defendant Sandra Mueller (\"Chief Mueller\") is the Chief of Corrections of \nOcean County and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pretrial and \nother detainees over which the Correctional Department exercises custodial or other \ncontrol. Chief Mueller is made a Defendant in this action in both her individual and \nofficial capacities. \n8.  Ocean County will be referred to as the \"County Defendant\". \n9.  Both Warden Hutler and Chief Mueller will be referred to as the \"Policy \nMaking Defendants\". \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \n3 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 4 of 14\nU .S.C. §§ 1331, 1341 and 1343 because it was filed to obtain compensatory damages, \npunitive damages and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the \nrights of citizens of the United States secured by the United States Constitution and by \nfederal law pursuant to 42 U.S .C. §§  1981 and 1983. This Court also has jurisdiction over \nthis action under the provisions of28 U.S.C. §220I, as it was filed to obtain declaratory \nrelief relative to the Constitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n11.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §1391(e)(2) because the events \ngiving rise to the Plaintiffs' claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this \njudicial district. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n12.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(I), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of Plaintiffs and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who were arrested for misdemeanors or other petty crimes or minor \nviolations and who were unlawfully strip-searched upon their entry into the Correctional \nDepartment. \n13.  The Class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as: \nAll persons who have been be placed into custody of the Ocean County \nCorrectional Facility after being charged with non-indictable offenses (such as \ndisorderly persons offenses, traffic infractions and/or civil commitments) and \nwere strip-searched upon their transfer and entry into the Ocean County \nCorrectional Department. The Class period commences on or about November 28, \n2005 and extends to the date on which the County Defendant is enjoined from, or \notherwise ceases from, enforcing its unconstitutional policy, practice and custom \nof conducting strip-searches absent reasonable suspicion. Specifically excluded \nfrom the Class are Defendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n14.  This action may be brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n4 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 5 of 14\n15.  The members ofthe Class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nThere are, and have been, hundreds and probably thousands of people who have been \narrested for misdemeanors, violations, traffic infractions, failing to make payment on \noutstanding traffic violations, failing to make payment on outstanding fines or other \nminor non-indictable crimes who were strip-searched under the circumstances described \nherein. \n16.  Joinder of all these individuals is impracticable because of the large number \nof Class members and the fact that Class members are likely dispersed over a large \ngeographic area, with some members, residing outside of Ocean County and this Judicial \nDistrict. Furthermore, many members of the Class are low-income persons, may not \nspeak English, may not know of their rights and likely would have great difficulty in \npursuing their rights individually. \n17.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class that \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  The \npredominant common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common \nand predominate question of whether the Defendants' written and/or de facto policies of \nstrip-searching individuals who were charged with non-indictable charges or violations \nwhen transferred to and placed into the custody of the Correctional Department violate \nthe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and whether \nsuch a written and/or de facto policy existed during the Class period. \n18.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical ofthe claims of the members of the Class. \nPlaintiffs and all members of the Class have sustained damages arising out of \nDefendants' course of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the \nharms suffered by the Class. \n5 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 6 of 14\n19.  The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the \noutcome ofthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n20.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nClass is impracticable given the large number of Class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed over a large geographic area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nClass to redress these constitutional violations.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjUdicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n21.  The named Plaintiffs have retained counsel with substantial experience and \nsuccess in the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  Plaintiffs are being \nrepresented by Jonathan W. Cuneo, Charles J. LaDuca and Alexandra Warren of Cuneo \nGilbert & LaDuca, LLP; Elmer Robert Keach, III, Esquire; Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich \nof the Locks Law Firm, PLLC and William Riback, Esquire.  Plaintiffs counsel have the \nresources, expertise and experience to successfully prosecute this action against the \nDefendants.  No conflict exists between the Plaintiffs and members of the Class, or \nbetween counsel and members of the Class. \n22.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \n6 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 7 of 14\nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of detainees, even though the Defendants \nhave maintained their illegal strip-search regimen for at least the past several years. \n23.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, \nPlaintiffs seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip-searches of individuals charged \nwith non-indictable offenses that were transported to and placed into the custody of the \nCorrectional Department.  In short, the County Defendant and the Policy Making \nDefendant acted on grounds generally applicable to all Class members. \n24.  In addition to, and in the alternative, Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule \n23(b)(3) or seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n25.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials, such as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the employees they \nsupervise, from performing strip searches of pre-trial detainees who have been charged \nwith non-indictable offenses and civil commitments unless there is reasonable suspicion \nto believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n26.  Ocean County and the Policy Making Defendants have, nonetheless, \ninstituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip-searching all \nindividuals who enter the custody of the Correctional Facility regardless of the nature of \ntheir charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the \nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n27.  Further, Ocean County, and the Policy Making Defendants have also \ninstituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of conducting visual \n7 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 8 of 14\ninspection of detainees in a state of undress on all individuals who enter the custody of \nthe Correctional Facility, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their \ncharged crime.  For purposes of this Complaint, this practice is collectively referred to as \n\"strip-searches. \" \n28.  Ocean County and the Policy Making Defendants know or should know, that \nthey may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy or practice of \nconducting strip-searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion \n29.  The Defendants' written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom \nmandating blanket strip-searches of pre-trial non-indictable detainees and civil \ncommitment has been promulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary \nto clearly established law. \n30.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip-search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances incident to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \nOcean County and the Policy Making Defendant have promulgated, implemented, \nenforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or defacto policy, practice or custom of \nstrip-searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Ocean County Correction \nDepartment without any requirement of reasonable suspicion in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  This written and/or de facto policy made \nthe strip-searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, \nthe characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were \nrelevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip-searches. \n31.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \n8 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 9 of 14\nincluding the named Plaintiffs were the victim of a routine strip-search upon their entry \ninto the OCCF.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of \nreasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion.  Strip \nsearches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among other innocuous offenses such \nas, unpaid parking tickets, traffic violations, outstanding traffic fines and other non \nindictable offenses. \n32.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip-searches \n- each member of the Class, including the named Plaintiff - has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \n33.  Plaintiffs' experiences are representative of the Class. \n34.  Plaintiff, Jose Garcia (\"Garcia\" or \"Plaintiff\") is, and at all times relevant \nhereto has been, a resident ofthe State of New Jersey domiciled in Toms River New \nJersey. On or about August 2007 Mr. Garcia was frisked and hand cuffed in his home for \na child support warrant.  Plaintiff was transported to the Ocean County Correctional \nFacility through the Sally Port elevator.  Plaintiff was then patted down by another officer \nand taken to a shower room accompanied by a correctional officer.  Mr. Garcia was \ndirected to take his clothes off and turn his socks inside out.  The correctional office \nturned his clothes inside out and directed Plaintiff to lift his testicles.  Mr. Garcia was \nmade to turn around, bend over and spread his buttocks. \n35.  Plaintiff, Wesley K. Bell (\"Bell\" or \"Plaintiff') is, and at all times relevant \nhereto has been, a resident of the State of New Jersey domiciled in Manahawkin New \nJersey. On or about August 10,2007 Mr. Bell was brought to the correctional facility for \n9 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 10 of 14\ncivil contempt.  Plaintiff was similarly illegally strip searched upon his admission to \nOCCF. \n36. Plaintiff, Edward Bizzarro (\"Bizzarro\" or \"Plaintiff') is, and at all times \nrelevant hereto has been, a resident of the State of New Jersey domiciled in Manahawkin \nNew Jersey. In or about September 2007 Mr. Bizzarro was arrested for failing to pay \nchild support.  Plaintiff was transported to the Ocean County Correctional Facility. \nPlaintiff was similarly illegally strip searched upon his admission to OCCF. \n37. Plaintiff, Richard Wright (\"Wright\" or \"Plaintiff') is, and at all times relevant \nhereto has been, a resident of the State of New Jersey domiciled in Toms River New \nJersey. On or about October 1,2007 Mr. Wright turned himself in on a warrant for child \nsupport.  Plaintiff was similarly illegally strip searched upon his admission to OCCF. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n--Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies \nTo Avoid Constitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law--\n38.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 37. \n39.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip-searches of pre-trial detainees arrested for non-indictable offenses or \nviolations absent some particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either \ncontraband or weapons. \n10 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 11 of 14\n40.  The actions of all Defendants as detailed above, violated Plaintiffs' and the \nClass' rights under the United States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively \nreasonable for Correctional Facility personnel to strip-search Plaintiffs and the members \nof the Class based on their arrests for non-indictable offenses.  It was also not objectively \nreasonable for the Policy Making Defendants to order/direct Correctional Department \npersonnel to conduct such searches or to have a policy or practice permitting such \nsearches. \n41.  These strip-searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of Ocean County and the Policy Making Defendant.  As such, these Defendants \nare directly liable for the damages of the Class. \n42.  Upon information and belief, Ocean County and the Policy Making \nDefendants are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in \nthe operation of the Correctional Department and are responsible for the implementation \nof the strip-search policy questioned in this lawsuit. \n43.  Ocean County and the Policy Making Defendants knew that the above \ndescribed strip-search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with \nspecific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and the members of the Class oftheir Constitutional \nrights. \n44. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n45.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs and the Class have been irreparably injured and seek damages, as well as the \ndeclaratory and injunctive and relief set out immediately below in the Prayer for Relief. \n11 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 12 of 14\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n46.  The actions of the Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that they \ncontinue to propagate an illegal strip-search policy even though they know for a fact that \ntheir actions are unconstitutional. \n47.  It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants have no, or little, respect for the \ncivil rights of individual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of \npunitive damages is necessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a \nmessage to them that the requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to \ngovernment officials in Ocean County. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n48.  The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs individually and on behalf of a Class of others similarly \nsituated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23 with Plaintiff as Class representative. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiff s \nCause of Action detailed herein, awarding Compensatory Damages to named \nPlaintiffs and each member of the proposed Class in an amount to be \ndetermined by a Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide \nbasis. \nC.  A judgment against the Policy Making Defendants, Theodore J. Hutler Jr. \nand Sandra Mueller on Plaintiffs' Cause of Action for punitive damages in an \namount to be determined by a properly charged jury. \n12 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB     Document 1      Filed 11/28/2007     Page 13 of 14\nD.  A declaratory judgment against Ocean County and the policy making \nDefendants declaring their policy, practice and custom of strip searching all \ndetainees entering the Correctional Department, regardless of the offense \ncharged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nE.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendant Ocean \nCounty and the Corrections Officers they supervise from continuing to strip \nsearch individuals charged with pre-trial non-indictable offenses absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the search is \nconcealing weapons or other contraband. \nF.  A monetary award for attorney's fees and the costs of this action, pursuant \nto 42 U.S.c. § 1988, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and the Court's inherent powers. \nG.  Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted by: \nDated: November 28, 2007 \nCamden, New Jersey  /s/ William Riback \nWilliam Riback, Esquire \n527 Cooper Street, 2nd Floor \nCamden, N.J. 08102 \n856/342-9700 \nJonathan W.

This is a class action lawsuit brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights \nsecured to the Plaintiffs and proposed Class by the United States Constitution, the laws of the \nUnited States of America and the laws of the State of New Jersey. For at least the past two years \nprior to the date of the commencement of this litigation, the Ocean County Sheriff's Department \nand Ocean County Department of Corrections have had a policy of strip-searching all individuals \nwho enter the Ocean County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon \nwhich they are charged. Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from the \nwritten procedures of the Ocean County Sheriff's Department and Ocean County Department of \nCorrections, and was promulgated by senior Department officials, specifically Theodore J. \n.\n  1 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 2 of 16 PageID: 683\nHutler, Jr., Warden of the Ocean County Correctional Facility, and Sandra Mueller, Chief of \nCorrections of the Ocean County Correctional Facility  \n2.  It has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or minor violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized suspicion \nthat they possess weapons or contraband. In short, the policy of Ocean County and the Ocean \nCounty Sheriff's Department to force those charged with minor crimes to undergo the indignities \nof a strip search upon entry into the Ocean County Jail was clearly illegal.  \n3.  Edward Bizzarro, Richard Wright, and April Wedding (together, “Plaintiffs”) bring this \naction on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class of thousands of others who were strip \nsearched after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation \nof their civil rights and those of the class members they propose to represent. Plaintiffs were \ncharged with misdemeanor and violation offenses, and subjected to strip searches, in violation of \ntheir rights against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for themselves and each member of the proposed \nclass, and a declaration that the Sheriff's Department’s and Correction’s Department policies \nwere unconstitutional. With the foregoing as background, Plaintiffs Edward Bizzarro, Richard \nWright, and April Wedding complain as follows:1 \n \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs file this Third Amended Complaint pursuant to the Court’s direction contained in its \nJune 9, 2009 opinion certifying and ordering the certification of the Class in this action under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and ordering the filing of this complaint deleting claims for \ninjunctive relief.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are also not setting forth a claim for certification under \nRule 23(b)(2) but reserve the right to re-amend or seek leave to re-amend to do so should, \nsubsequently, the Court’s June 9, 2009 opinion be reversed or superseded or the factual \npredicates for that opinion be altered. \n  2 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 3 of 16 PageID: 684\nJURISDICTION  \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \n1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages and punitive damages, for the \ndeprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured by the \nConstitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983. This Court also has \njurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, inasmuch as it is filed to \nobtain declaratory relief relative to the Constitutionality of the policies of a local government.  \nSupplemental jurisdiction exists over Plaintiffs’ pendent state law claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1367(a) because Plaintiffs’ state law claim is so related to the federal claims within such original \njurisdiction that it forms part of the same case or controversy as do the federal claims.  \n5.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to Plaintiffs’ \nclaims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district.  \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff Edward Bizzarro (“Bizzarro”) resides in Manahawkin, New Jersey.  In or about \nSeptember of 2007, Bizzarro was arrested for failing to pay child support and transported to the \nOcean County Jail where he was strip searched upon admission. \n7.  Plaintiff Richard Wright (“Wright”) resides in Toms River, New Jersey.  On or about \nOctober 1, 2007, Wright turned himself in on a warrant for child support.  Wright was strip \nsearched upon his admission to the Ocean County Jail. \n8.  Plaintiff April Wedding (“Wedding”) resides in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey.  In or \nabout August of 2007, Wedding was arrested for late payment of a traffic fine and was strip \nsearched upon her admission to the Ocean County Jail. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 4 of 16 PageID: 685\n9.  Defendant County of Ocean (the “County”) is a county governmental entity organized \nand existing under the laws of the State of New. Jersey. At all times relevant hereto, the County, \nacting through its Sheriffs Department and Department of Corrections, was responsible for the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the \nOcean County Jail and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of \nall Sheriff’s Department personnel, including those working in the Ocean County Jail. In \naddition, at all relevant times, the County was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Ocean \nCounty Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriff’s Department and Department of Corrections’ \npersonnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the \nState of New Jersey.  \n10. The Ocean County Sheriff’s Department (the “Sheriff’s Department”) is a County \nSheriff's Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of New Jersey. Although \nnot a legal entity for the purposes of this litigation, the Department is listed as a party for the \npurposes of identification. At all times relevant hereto, the Sheriff's Department was responsible \nfor operating, organizing, overseeing and administering the Ocean County Jail (“OCJ”). At all \ntimes relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriff's Department, together with the County of Ocean, was \nresponsible for the polices, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters \npertaining to the OCJ, and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and \nconduct of all Sheriff's Department personnel, including those working in the OCJ. In addition, \nat all times relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriff's Department, together with the County of Ocean, \nwas responsible for enforcing the rules of the Ocean County Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriff's \nDepartment personnel employed in the OCJ obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates and of the State of New Jersey.  \n  4 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 5 of 16 PageID: 686\n11. Defendant Ocean County Department of Corrections (the \"Jail\" or \"OCDOC\") is a county \ngovernmental organization and exists under the laws of the State of New Jersey.  Although not a \ndefendant for purposes of this litigation, the Department is listed as a party for the purposes of \nidentification. At all times relevant hereto, the County, acting through its Warden and the \nOCDOC, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of \nall matters pertaining to the Ocean County Jail and was responsible for the appointment, training, \nsupervision and conduct of all Sheriff's Department personnel, including those working in the \nOcean County Jail. In addition, at all relevant times, the County was responsible for enforcing \nthe rules of the Ocean County Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriffs Department and OCDOC \npersonnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the \nState of New Jersey.  \n12. Defendant Theodore J. Hutler, Jr. (\"Warden Hutler\") is the duly appointed Warden of the \nOcean County Department of Corrections, and, as such, was a policy maker with respect to the \ntreatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the OCDOC exercises custodial or other \ncontrol. Warden Tyler is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official \ncapacities. \n13. Defendant Sandra Mueller (\" Chief Mueller\") is the Chief of Corrections of Ocean \nCounty and, as such, was a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other \ndetainees over which the OCDOC exercises custodial or other control. Chief Mueller is made a \nDefendant in this action in both her individual and official capacities.  \n14. Collectively, Warden Hutler and Chief Mueller will be referred to as the “Policy Making \nDefendants.” \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  \n  5 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 6 of 16 PageID: 687\n15. Plaintiffs brings this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals who were charged with misdemeanors (disorderly persons offenses) or other non-\nindictable offenses and were strip searched upon their entry into the Ocean County Jail. \n16. The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the Ocean County \nJail after being charged with non-indictable offenses such as disorderly persons \noffenses, traffic infractions, and/or civil commitments and were strip searched \nupon their entry into the Ocean County Jail. The class period commences on \nNovember 28, 2005 and ends on December 28, 2007.. Specifically excluded from \nthe class are Defendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.  \n17.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under \nFederal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy requirements for \nmaintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n18. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.   There are \nhundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors, traffic warrants, child support and other \nviolations which do not support probable cause to search, who are placed into the custody of the \nOcean County Jail every month — all of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon \ninformation and belief; the size of the proposed class totals at least 4,000 individuals, some of \nwhom have had their civil rights violated on more than one occasion.  \n19.  Joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable because of the large number of class \nmembers and the fact that class members are likely dispersed over a large geographical area, \nwith some members presently residing outside of Ocean County and this Judicial District. \nFurthermore, many members of the class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and \nlikely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually.  \n  6 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 7 of 16 PageID: 688\n20. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, in that they all \nhad their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants conducting strip \nsearches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were charged with \nmisdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Ocean County Jail, and all were \nillegally strip searched in violation of the established law in this judicial circuit.  \n21. Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the class. Plaintiffs and all \nmembers of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants' course of conduct.  The \nharms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the class members.  \n22. The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this \naction and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  Plaintiffs have no interests \nthat are adverse to the interests of the members of the class.  \n23. Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and success in the \nprosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  Counsel for Plaintiffs know of no conflicts \namong members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class.  \n24. Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).  \n25. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, and predominate \nover any questions that affect only individual members of the class. These common questions of \nlaw and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate question of whether the \nDefendants' written and/or de facto policy of strip searching all individuals charged with \nmisdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Ocean County Jail is a violation of the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a \nwritten and/or de facto policy existed during the class period.  \n  7 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 8 of 16 PageID: 689\n26. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication \nof this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the class is impracticable \ngiven the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a large \ngeographical area. Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would make it \ndifficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to them. \nThe cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would be \nenormous. Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and \nthe court system. By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents \nfar fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, \nand protects the rights of each member of the class.  \n27. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though the \nDefendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the class period.  \n28. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also seek \npartial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally  \n29. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, such as \nthe Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they supervise, from \nperforming strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors (disorderly \npersons offenses) other minor crimes, traffic offenses, warrants for child support, or other non-\nindictable offenses, unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is \nconcealing a weapon or contraband.  \n  8 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 9 of 16 PageID: 690\n30. In turn, under New Jersey law, specifically N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c), any person who is \ndeprived of substantive due process or equal protection rights, privileges or immunities secured \nby the Constitution or laws of the United States or by the Constitution or laws of the State of \nNew Jersey has a claim under State law. \n31. Upon information and belief, the County of Ocean, the Ocean County Sheriffs \nDepartment, the Ocean County Department of Corrections, and the Policy Making Defendants \nhave instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all \nindividuals who enter the custody of the Ocean County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, \nregardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion \nto believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband.  \n32. Upon information and belief, the County of Ocean, the Ocean County Sheriff's \nDepartment, the Ocean County Department of Corrections, and the Policy Making Defendants \nhave instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of conducting visual body \ncavity searches (visual inspection of the vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter \nthe custody of the Ocean County Jail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of \ntheir charged crime. For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are \ncollectively referred to as “strip searches.”  \n33. The County of Ocean, the Ocean County Sheriff's Department, the Ocean County \nDepartment of Corrections, and the Policy Making Defendants know that they may not institute, \nenforce or permit enforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion. Upon information and belief, the Ocean County's written \npolicy was based on the policy promulgated by the Ocean County Sheriffs Department and/or the \nOcean County Department of Corrections.  \n  9 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 10 of 16 PageID: 691\n34. The Defendants' written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating wholesale \nstrip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been promulgated, effectuated \nand/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law.  \n35. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the particular \ncircumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the particular \ncharacteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.  \n36. Upon information and belief, the County of Ocean, the Ocean County Sheriff's \nDepartment, the Ocean County Department of Corrections, and Policy Making Defendants have \npromulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, \npractice or custom of strip searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Ocean County \nJail and placed into jail clothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed \nsuspicion of any sort. This written and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial \ndetainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor \nthe circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice \nand custom of routine strip searches.  \n37. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the class, including every \nnamed Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the Ocean County \nJail. These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of reasonable \nsuspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion. Strip searches are conducted \nfor individuals arrested for, among other offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and \nTrespassing.  \n38. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to this \nwritten and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches, each member of the \n  10 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 11 of 16 PageID: 692\nclass including every named Plaintiff — has suffered or will suffer psychological pain, \nhumiliation, suffering and mental anguish.  \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \n39.  Plaintiff Edward Bizzarro was arrested for failing to pay child support.  He was \ntransported to the Ocean County Jail and was strip searched upon admission. \n40. Plaintiff Richard Wright turned himself in on a warrant for child support and was \nsimilarly strip searched upon his admission to the Ocean County Jail. \n41. Plaintiff April Wedding was arrested for late payment of a traffic fine and was similarly \nstrip searched upon her admission to the Ocean County Jail. \n42. Bizzarro, Wright and Wedding were strip searched according to the policy and practice of \nthe Ocean County Jail, without reasonable suspicion that they were carrying contraband.  \n43. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted pursuant to \nCounty and Sheriff's Department policy, practice and custom, Plaintiffs have suffered and \ncontinues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n—Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivation Under Color of State Law— \n44. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in the \npreceding paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein.  \n45. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \n  11 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 12 of 16 PageID: 693\nsearches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent some particularized \nsuspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons.  \n46. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the United \nStates Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Ocean County Corrections \nOfficers to strip search Plaintiffs and class members based on their arrests for non-\nindictable/violation charges. It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making \nDefendants to order/direct Ocean County Corrections Officers to conduct such searches.  \n47. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of the \nCounty of Ocean, Ocean County Sheriff's Department, and the Ocean County Department of \nCorrections. As such, the County of Ocean is directly liable for the damages of the named \nPlaintiffs and members of the class.  \n48. Upon information and belief, the Policy Making Defendants are responsible for \nestablishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Ocean County Jail, \nand are responsible for the implementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit. \nAs such, the Policy Making Defendants are each individually responsible for the damages of the \nnamed Plaintiffs and members of the class.  \n49. The Policy Making Defendants knew that the Ocean County Jail’s strip search policy was \nillegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and members \nof the class of their Constitutional rights.  \n50. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \ngiven that their actions were undertaken under color of state law.  \n51. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiffs \nand the class have been injured and are entitled to the relief set forth below. \n  12 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 13 of 16 PageID: 694\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Statutory Rights Under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act \n \n—Deprivation of Substantive Due Process Rights, Immunities, or Privileges under the New \nJersey Constitution— \n52. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in the \npreceding paragraphs, as though fully set forth herein.  \n53. N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c) provides a right of action for any citizen who is deprived of any \nsubstantive due process or equal protection rights, privileges or immunities secured by the \nConstitution or laws of the United States or by the Constitution or laws of the State of New \nJersey, or whose exercise or enjoyment of those substantive rights, privileges or immunities has \nbeen interfered with or attempted to be interfered with, by threats, intimidation or coercion by a \nperson acting under color of law.  \n54. The actions of the Defendants as detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ and the class’s rights \nunder the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. It was neither objectively reasonable nor \nconstitutional for the Corrections Division personnel to strip-search Plaintiffs and all the \nmembers of the class based on their arrests for non-indictable offenses. It was neither objectively \nreasonable nor constitutional for the Sheriff’s Department personnel to conduct such search or to \nhave a policy or practice permitting such searches.  \n55. These strip-searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of Ocean \nCounty. As such, the Defendants are directly liable for the damages of the class.  \n56. Upon information and belief, Ocean County is responsible for establishing the policies \nand procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Corrections Division and are responsible for \nthe implementation of the strip-search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  \n  13 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 14 of 16 PageID: 695\n57. Ocean County knew that the above described strip-search policy was illegal, and acted \nwillfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and the members of the class \nof their Statutory rights. \n58. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiffs \nand the class have been irreparably injured and seek damages, as well as the declaratory relief set \nout immediately below in the Prayer for Relief.  \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES  \n59. The actions of the Policy Making Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that they \ncontinue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a fact that their \nactions are unconstitutional.  \n60. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Ocean, the Ocean County \nSheriff's Department, and the Ocean County Department of Corrections have little or no respect \nfor the civil rights of individual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of \npunitive damages is necessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to \nthem that the requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government officials in \nOcean County.  \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n61. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury.  \n \n \n  14 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-05665-FLW-TJB   Document 44   Filed 06/29/09   Page 15 of 16 PageID: 696\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Edward Bizzarro, Richard Wright, and April Wedding, on \nbehalf of themselves and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated, request that this \nHonorable Court grant the following relief: \nA. An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  \nB.

A judgment against each named Defendant, individually, awarding compensatory \ndamages and punitive damages to Plaintiffs and each member of the proposed class in \namount to be determined by a jury and/or this court on an individual and/or a class wide \nbasis. \nD. A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the County of Ocean and the \nOcean County Sheriffs Department's policy, practice and custom of strip and visual \ncavity searching all detainees entering the Ocean County Jail, regardless of the crime \ncharged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nE.  A monetary award for attorney's fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1988, N.J.S.A. 10:6-2, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nF.

The\ninstant motion arises out of a class action initiated by Plaintiffs to seek redress after allegedly\nbeing subjected to unlawful strip searches as pretrial detainees charged with non-indictable\noffenses while in the custody of the Ocean County Correctional Facility (“Ocean County Jail”).  \nIn this motion, Plaintiffs argue that the stay entered by this Court pending the Third Circuit’s\ndecision in the unrelated matter of  Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of\nBurlington, et al., Civ. A. No. 05-3619, should be lifted because: (1) the Third Circuit’s decision\nin Florence only addressed the constitutionality of strip searches and did not address the\nconstitutionality of visual body cavity searches; and (2) Plaintiffs additionally set forth a claim\n1\n\nunder the New Jersey Civil Rights Act.  For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff’s Motion is\nDENIED.1\nI. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nBecause this matter has a significant procedural history, the Court will only recount facts\nrelevant to the instant motion.  As discussed above, Plaintiffs initiated a class action alleging that\nafter being arrested for non-indictable offenses, such as failure to pay child support and traffic\nfines, the members of the class  were illegally and unconstitutionally required to undress for\ninspection by Defendants in violation of their right to privacy under the United States and New\nJersey Constitutions.   Specifically and in relevant part, Plaintiffs allege that while being held in\nOcean County Jail, they were subjected to the facility’s strip search policy, including being\nforced to undergo “visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the vaginal and rectal\ncavities).”   Third Amended Complaint ¶ 32.  By Order dated June 9, 2009, this Court certified\nthe Class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \nThereafter, in November 2009, this Court granted a motion by Defendants to Stay the\nProceedings pending the outcome of the Third Circuit’s decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen\nFreeholders of the County of Burlington.  Like this case, the Florence case is a class action in\nwhich the plaintiffs allege that members of the class were arrested for non-indictable offenses\nand were subject to strip searches in violation of their federal and State constitutional rights. On\nSeptember 21, 2010, the Third Circuit issued a decision in Florence upholding, as constitutional, \nblanket strip searches of non-indictable pretrial detainees. 621 F.3d 296 (3d Cir. 2010).  The\n1The Court notes that it reaches the same conclusion in Takacs v. Middlesex County, et.\nal., Civ. No. 08-694, and that a separate opinion is being entered in that case. \n2\n\nFlorence decision reversed the District Court and controverted decisions in seven sister Circuit\nCourts.  \nFollowing the Third Circuit’s decision, on January 19, 2011, the plaintiff in Florence filed a\nPetition for A Writ of Certiorari with the United States Supreme Court (“Petition”).  The\nSupreme Court granted the Petition on April 4, 2011.  Despite the Supreme Court’s acceptance\nof the Petition, Plaintiffs ask this Court to lift the stay entered in this matter in 2009. \nII. DISCUSSION\nIt is well-established that a District Court maintains “broad power to stay proceedings.” \nBechtel Corp., v. Local 215 Laborers’ International Union of North America, 544 F.2d 1207,\n1215 (3d Cir. 1976).   The Third Circuit has explained that “ the power to stay proceedings is\nincidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its\ndocket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants. How this can best\nbe done calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh competing interests and maintain\nan even balance.”  Id. (quoting Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1936)). \nMoreover, “in the exercise of its sound discretion, a court may hold one lawsuit in abeyance to\nabide the outcome of another which may substantially affect it or be dispositive of the issues.” \nBechtel, 544 F.2d at 1215.  \nAs discussed above, in the instant matter, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should lift the stay\nentered in these proceedings.  Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that: (1) in Florence, the Third\nCircuit did not address the constitutionality of a blanket body-cavity search policy on pre-trail\nnon-indictable detainees as is asserted in this matter; and (2) in addition to the federal claims,\n3\n\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint here sets forth a statutory claim under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act\nwhich this Court should consider on the basis of this Court’s Supplemental Jurisdiction.   Pls’\nReply Br. At 2-3.  The Court does not agree. 2\nA review of the Florence Petition demonstrates that a stay in the above-captioned matter\ncontinues to be warranted and will remain in effect pending the Supreme Court’s decision in\nFlorence.   \nInitially, the Court notes that the facts set forth in the Florence Petition provide that while\nbeing  held in Burlington County Jail, Mr. Florence was required “to strip naked for inspection\nby an officer. . . the officer directed Florence to open his mouth, lift his tongue, and lift his arms. \nThe officer required Florence to turn around so that he could examine Florence’s backside.  The\nofficer finally ordered Florence to turn back around and lift his genitals for inspection.”  Petition\nat 5.  Similarly, after being transferred to Essex County Correctional Facility, Mr. Florence was\nstrip searched pursuant to the policy of that facility and was required to “open [his] mouth, lift\n[his] genitals, and then turn around, squat and cough.”  Id. at 7.3  Based on these facts, the\nFlorence Petition specifically asks the Supreme Court to resolve the split amongst the Circuit\nCourts as to: “[w]hether the Fourth Amendment permits a jail to conduct a suspicionless strip\n2In addition, Defendants incorrectly assert that the class definition governing this action\nonly refers to strip searches and does not explicitly include body cavity searches.  But the Court\nnotes that Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint provides that “strip and visual cavity searches\nare collectively referred to as ‘strip searches.’”  Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ pleadings\nrefer to both strip searches and body cavity searches. \n3As in Florence, the Complaint in this matter alleges that while being held in Ocean\nCounty Correctional Facility, Plaintiffs were subjected to the facility’s strip search policy\nsearches including “visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the vaginal and rectal\ncavities).”   Third Amended Complaint ¶ 32. \n4\n\nsearch of every individual arrested for any minor offense, whatever the circumstances.”  Id. at\n13.4  Importantly, the Petition cites to the contradictory decisions arising in the Circuit Courts and\ndemonstrates, based on the various courts’ holdings, that some of the courts that have considered\nthe issues have, in fact, ruled on the constitutionality of visual body cavity searches, as well as\nstrip searches.  See Petition at 14 n.1 (citing to Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.\n1986)(“We hold that the Fourth Amendment precludes prision officials from performing\nstrip/body cavity searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor\noffenses...”)(emphasis added); Petition at 16 n. 2 (citing to Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 12989,\n1307 (11th Cir. 2008)(en banc)(“The Bell decision . . . [i]s inconsistent with the conclusion that\nthe Fourth Amendment requries reasonable suspicion before an inmate entering or re-entering a\ndetention facility may be subjected to a strip search that includes a body cavity\ninspection.”)(emphasis added)).   Moreover, the Petition explains that the Florence “case which\ninvolves two different jails, which apply different policies and conducted somewhat different\nsearches in distinct circumstances, makes this case particularly well-suited as an opportunity to\nthoroughly explore the Fourth Amendment’s application to searches of non-indictable arrestees.” \nPetition at 31(emphasis added).   Thus, the Court finds that the Florence Petition can be read as\nasking the Supreme Court to review the entirety of the issues concerning the constitutionality of\n4Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Florence “abandoned” his visual body cavity search claims,\nPls’ Br. at 6; a review of  the Third Circuit’s opinion in Florence demonstrates that “Florence\nsought class certification only on his strip search claims; he did not seek certification on his\nclaim that he was subjected to a visual body cavity search.”  621 F.3d at 300 n.1.  The Court\nfinds that although Mr. Florence may not have sought class certification on his visual body cavity\nsearch claims, the facts alleged in the Petition, discussed supra, make clear that Mr. Florence\ncontinues to argue that he was subject to both a strip search and a visual body cavity search in\nviolation of his Fourth Amendment rights and that the Supreme Court may ultimately consider\nboth types of searches. \n5\n\nstrip searches on pretrial detainees charged with non-indictable offenses which may include the\nconstitutionality of visual body cavity searches.   \nHowever, even if the Supreme Court considers only strip searches and not body cavity\nsearches, this Court would reach the same conclusion on this motion.  As pointed out in the Third\nCircuit’s decision in Bechtel, a court “may hold one lawsuit in abeyance to abide the outcome of\nanother which may substantially affect it or be dispositive of the issues.” 544 F.2d at 1215\n(emphasis added).   Here, there is no doubt that even if the Supreme Court limits its review and\ndiscussion to strip searches, the Court’s analysis would substantively impact the claims asserted\nin this matter.  To proceed piecemeal with claims in this case in light of the potential for the\nSupreme Court to resolve either all or some of the strip search issues would not be a good use of\nthis Court’s or the litigants’ time and resources.  As a result,  this Court will exercise its\ndiscretion and will refrain from entering a debate that is currently pending before the Supreme\nCourt.    \nMoreover, to the extent that Plaintiffs ask  this Court to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction\nand rule on their claims under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act, the Court has already indicated\nthat if no federal issues remain, it will not exercise supplemental jurisdiction to resolve purely\nstate law issues.  Thus, for the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs’ motion is DENIED.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs motion is DENIED and the case will remain\nadministratively terminated pending a decision by the Supreme Court in Florence.  An\nappropriate order will issue. \n6\n\nDated: April 12, 2011 /s/ Freda L. Wolfson             \nFreda L. Wolfson, U.S.D.J. \n7",
