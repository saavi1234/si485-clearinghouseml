    "summary": "<p>On April 3, 2000, the New York County Lawyers' Association (NYCLA) filed a 42 U.S.C. §1983 action in the Supreme Court for New York County against the city and state of New York and Governor George E. Pataki.  Plaintiff alleged that Defendants' failure to increase compensation rates from 1986 levels for assigned indigent defense counsel in New York City criminal and family court proceedings violated indigent clients' constitutional and statutory right to counsel. </p><p>Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy the alleged deficiency.  Specifically, Plaintiff requested that the court issue an order requiring Defendants (1) to increase hourly compensation rates from $25 per hour of in-court work and $40 per hour of out-of-court work to $100 per hour with no distinction between rates paid for in-court and out-of-court work, (2) to remove ceilings on total compensation allowable per case, and (3) to comply with the forgoing until Defendants reformed the indigent defense system to enable it to carry out its constitutional obligations.  Plaintiff further requested that the court issue a second injunctive order scheduled to take effect two months after the first order.  Plaintiff requested that this second order require Defendants to (1) provide sufficient numbers of indigent defense attorneys, (2) limit caseloads, and (3) enforce existing standards and guidelines relating to assigned counsel.</p><p>On January 16, 2001, the Supreme Court for New York County (Judge Lucindo Suarez) dismissed all claims against the Governor, but held that Plaintiff had standing and stated a justiciable claim against city and state Defendants.  New York County Lawyers' Association v. Pataki, 727 N.Y.S.2d 851 (Sup.Ct.N.Y.Co.2001).  On May 9, 2002, the Appellate Division (Judges David B. Saxe, Ernst H. Rosenberger, Richard W. Wallach, George D. Marlow, and Louis A. Gonzalez) affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court.  New York County Lawyers' Association v. State of New York, 742 N.Y.S.2d 16 (1st Dep't 2002).</p><p>On May 3, 2002, the Supreme Court for New York County (Judge Lucindo Suarez) issued a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to increase the compensation rate to $90 per hour for both in-court and out-of-court work.  The court refused, however, to issue the second requested injunctive order requiring defendants to limit caseloads and abide by performance standards on the ground that such an order would constitute judicial usurpation of the legislative function.  The court also declined to declare the compensation statute unconstitutional on grounds that a trial was necessary to decide the matter.  New York County Lawyers' Association v. State of New York, 745 N.Y.S.2d 376 (N.Y. Sup., 2002).</p><p>On February 5, 2003, after a bench trial, the Supreme Court for New York County (Judge Lucindo Suarez) found that inadequate statutory compensation rates generated assigned counsel shortages and denied indigent clients effective assistance of counsel in criminal and family court proceedings.  The court thereby declared the statutory caps unconstitutional as applied and issued a permanent injunction requiring a rate increase to $90 per hour without distinction between in-court and out-of-court work, and without ceilings on total per case compensation, until such time as the Legislature acted to increase rates.  New York County Lawyers' Association v. State of New York, 763 N.Y.S.2d 397 (N.Y.Sup., 2003).</p><p>The city and state filed an appeal of the Supreme Court decision but on December 2, 2003, agreed to stipulate to the withdrawal of this appeal.  Following the enactment of state legislation reforming the assigned counsel compensation system, the parties agreed, in November 2003, to settle the suit.  The 2003 state legislation (a) increased compensation rates to $60 per hour for misdemeanors and $75 per hour for all other cases, (b) increased per-case maximums, and (c) provided that per-case maximums could be waived upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances.</p><p>We have no further information on this case.</p><p></p>",

Did the lower Court err in granting preliminary\ninjunctive rel£ef, given that plaintiff did not demonstrate\n\nactual irrepa]:'able harm and given that the preliminary\ninjunctive relief compels appropriation of public funds without\ngiving the legislature the opportunity to remedy any statutory\ndeficiencies?\n2. Assuming, arg_u_ndo, that plaintiff is entitled to\nsome sort of preliminary injunctive relief, did the !ower Court\noverstep its authority by setting a rate of $90 per hour; by\nmaking its order, including the $90 per hour rate, equa].ly\napplicable to all cases to which the Court applied it; and by\nmaking the preliminary injunctive relief appliuable to cases in\nwhich there is no constitutional right to the assistance of\ncounsel?\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS, PROCEDURAL HISTORY, AND ORDER APPEALED FROM\nFor a statement of the facts relevant to t_is appeal,\nthe procedural history that led to this appeal, and a summary of\nthe order appealed frcn,, the City respectfully refers the Court\nto the Statement of the Case section of the Brief for Defendant-\nAppellant the State of New York.\nPOI}_ I\nTHE LOWER COURT RRRED IN GRANTI_\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,\nGIVEN THAT PLAINTIFF FAILED TO\nDEMONSTRATE ACTUAL IRREPARABLE\nHARM AND GIVEN THAT THE\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\nCOMPELS APPROPRIATION OF PUBLIC\nFUNDS WITHOUT GIVING THE\nLEGISLATURE THE OPPORTUNITY TO\nREMEDY ANY STATUTORY DEFICIENCIES.\nAs the City joins ful_Ly in the arguments urged by the\nState defendant, both (i) that plaintiff did not make the\nrequisite factual showing to support preliminary injunctive\n2\n\nrelief helein and (2) that the lower Court should not have\nassumed the legislature's role of amending a statute where an\nexisting statute is declared unconstitutional, the City\nrespectfully refers the Court to Point I of the Brief for\nDefendant-Appellant the State of NewYork.\nPOINT II\nASSUMING, ARGUENDO, THAT PLAINTIFF\nIS ENTITLED TO SOME SORT OF\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, THE\nLOWER COURT OVERSTEPPED ITS\nAUTHORITY BY SETTING A RATE OF $90\nPER HOUR, BY MAKING THE\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\nEQUALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL CASES TO\n_ICH THE COURT APPLIED IT, AND BY\nMAKING ITS O_DER APPLICABLE TO\nCASES IN WHICH THERE IS NO\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO THE\nASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\nAs the City joins fully in the arguments urged by the\nState defendant, (l) that the lower Court did not have the\nauthority to set a new rate of payment of statutorily-authorized\ncounsel for the indigent, as such function is one of the\nlegislature, (2) that even if t e lower Court had authority to\nset a new rate of payment, the _:vidence herein does not support\nthe Court's determination that _he new rate will be $90 per\nhour, and (3) that there is no basis for raising the rates in\ncertain classes of cases, and (4) that the lower Court lacked\nthe authority to make any order applicable :_o cases in which\nthere is no constitutional right to the assistance of counsel,\nthe City respectfully refers the Court to Point II of the Brief\nfor Defendant-Appellant the State of New York.\n\nCONCLUSION\nTHE ORDER SHOULD BE REVERSED OR\nTHE INJUNCTION SHOULD BE MODIFIED.\nDated: August 5, 2002\nRespectfully submitted,\nMICHAEL A.

A Notice of Motion for Preliminary\nInjunction with Supporting Affirmations and Affidavits was\nserved on or about May 31, 2001. Several Opposing\nAffidavits and Affirmations were served.\nAI\n\nThe action seeks:\no\n(a) a declaratory judgment that the State Defendant has a\nconstitutional and statutory obligation to ensure that\nqualified assigned private counsel are available and\nable to provide meaningful and effective representation\nto children and indigent adults in New York City;\n(b) a declaratory judgment that the State Defendant's\nfailure to increase the rates paid to assigned private\ncounsel, to abolish the arbitrary distinction between\nthe rates paid for in-court and out-of-court work, and\nto remove the caps on total compensation per case has\ncreated a severe and unacceptably high risk that\nchildren and indigent adults are receiving inadequate\nlegal representation in New York City in violation of\nthe New York and United States Constitutions;\n(c) a declaratory judgment that those portions of S 722-b\nof the County Law, § 245 of the Family Court Act, and\n§ 35 of the Judiciary Law fixing these rates and limits\nare unconstitutional as applied to the representation\nof children and indigent adults in New York City;\n\n(d) an injunction setting new rates, abolishing the\ndistinction between the rates paid for in-court and\nout-of-court work, and removing the current limits on\ncompensation for private counsel who participate in the\nassigned counsel program. The new rates shall be set\nboth preliminarzly and permanently at a level\nsufficient to ensure that qualified private counsel\nare available and able to provide children and indigent\nadults in New York City with constitutionally adequate\nrepresentation in family and criminal court proceedings\nat the trial and appellate levels. NYCLA requests that\nthe Court issue such an injunction settinq new rates\naqainst the State Defendant, order the State Defendant\nto fund the expenses incurred as a result of the new\nrates and, to the extent necessary, .declare the\nprovisions of § 722-e of the County Law\nunconstitutional as applied to the expenses incurred\n!\nas a result of the new rates. In the alternative, .\nNYCLA reauests that the Court issue such an injunction\nsettinq new rates aqainst both the State and the City\nDefendants;\nA3\n\n(e) an award of attorney's fees, costs and disbursements\naccrued in pursuit of this action under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1988 and CPLR Article 86; and\n(f) such other and further relief as £he Court may deem\njust and proper.\nThe L_otice of Appeal on behalf of Defendant State of New\no\nYork is from the Orders dated May 3, 2002 and entered in\nNew York County on May 6, 2002 and the Decision and Order\ndated May 3, 2002 and entered in the office of the Clerk\nof New York County on May 6, 2002 (Hon.

Wainwright, the \nAmerican Bar Association’s Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants (ABA SCLAID) \nin 2003 held a series of public hearings to examine the implementation of the right to counsel in \nstate court proceedings for poor persons accused of crimes.  In January 2005, ABA SCLAID \npublished its final report based on the testimony provided at the hearings, entitled “Gideon’s Broken \nPromise:  America’s Continuing Quest for Equal Justice.”  This information sheet contains a short \nsummary of the “Problems in Indigent Defense” and “Model Approaches to Providing Services” in \nNew York that were reported by one of the hearing witnesses, as well as “Recent Reform Efforts” \nthat have occurred in the state.  For the complete information regarding each of the statements \nlisted below (including references to hearing transcripts, reports, and other supporting materials), \nplease see “Gideon’s Broken Promise:  America’s Continuing Quest for Equal Justice,” available at \nhttp://www.indigentdefense.org/brokenpromise.   \n \n \nProblems in Indigent Defense \n \nThe following problems were reported by the hearing witness: \n \n•  Although New York enacted legislation in 2003 to fund an increase in the rates of \ncompensation paid to private assigned counsel, according to the witness, “that money is \nclassically too little, too late; it is about half of what counties will need to implement the \nchange, and the money is not forthcoming until 2005.”  To avoid paying the higher rates out \nof their own budgets, the witness said that counties are engaged in a rapid “rush to the \nbottom” by either eliminating services entirely or replacing assigned counsel programs with \nlower-cost options, such as contract defender offices, without any guidance or concern for \nthe provision of quality representation.   \n \n•  Despite the guidance contained in national standards, there is no provision for formal, \nsystematic training of indigent defense attorneys or support staff at either the state or local \nlevels in New York.    \n     \n•  Eligibility for defense services often is restricted unconstitutionally in New York for the sole \npurpose of containing the costs of local systems. \n  1\nCopyright © 2005 American Bar Association \n\n       \n•  According to the witness, indigent defendants in New York “are mined for their money \nthrough partial payment scenarios, illegal co-pay scenarios, and all kinds of intrusive \nmechanisms that interfere with the right to counsel.” \n \n•  In New York, prosecution services receive funds from both the state and federal \ngovernments, yet primarily New York’s counties fund indigent defense services. \n \n•  Caseloads for indigent defense attorneys far exceed national standards; as the witness \nremarked, “Caseloads are radically out of whack in some places in New York.  There are \ncaseloads per year in which a lawyer handles 1,000, 1,200, 1,600 cases.” \n   \n•  Contrary to the recommendations contained in national standards, there is no statewide \noversight of indigent defense services to ensure uniformity in the quality of representation \nprovided.  Since each of the state’s counties are authorized by statute to establish methods \nfor providing indigent defense services within their communities, the result is more than 95 \ndifferent plans for providing representation.  Moreover, the plans differ in almost every \nrespect, including scope of service, staffing procedures, support services, investigation \ncapacity, training requirements, appointment practices, attorney skill level, and eligibility \nstandards. \n   \n \nRecent Reform Efforts \n \n•  In 2003, New York enacted legislation that increased the rates of compensation for assigned \ncounsel to $60 per hour for misdemeanors (with a per-case maximum of $2,400) and $75 \nper hour for all other cases (with a per-case maximum of $4,400).  All per-case maximums \nare waiveable, however, upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances.  Prior to the \nlegislation, the New York statutory rates of compensation were $25 per hour for out-of-court \nwork and $40 per hour for in-court work, with per-case maximums of $800 for \nmisdemeanors and $1,200 for felonies.  While the fee increase is effective January 2004, \nstate funding for the increase is uncertain and may not be available until 2005.  The \nlegislation also created a task force to review the adequacy of the new rates.  \n \n•  The statutory fee increases stemmed from a lawsuit instituted by the New York County \nLawyers Association (NYCLA) against New York State and New York City, challenging the \nconstitutionality of the statutory rates of compensation paid to private attorneys appointed to \nrepresent indigents in criminal and family court.  NYCLA was represented pro bono in this \nlitigation by the law firm of Davis, Polk & Wardwell.  In February 2003, a New York State \nSupreme Court judge ruled in favor of NYCLA and ordered the state and city to pay assigned \ncounsel $90 per hour until the state legislature modified the rates.  Although the decision \nwas appealed by the state and city, NYCLA settled the lawsuit in November 2003 after \nenactment of New York’s legislation increasing the assigned counsel fee rates.  \n \n•  In 2004, New York Chief Judge Judith Kaye established the Commission on the Future of \nIndigent Defense Services to examine the effectiveness of the state’s system and to develop \na blueprint for reform.  The commission is comprised of members from the bench and bar, \nlaw enforcement, criminal justice agencies, and academia.  In addition, efforts are underway \nin New York to establish a permanent statewide indigent defense agency to promulgate \nuniform performance standards for county indigent defense programs and to provide \n  2\nCopyright © 2005 American Bar Association \n\nsupplemental state funds to programs that comply with those standards.  A bill to create \nsuch an agency has been introduced in the state legislature during each of the last few years \nand has been endorsed by a wide range of groups.  The proposal also has been endorsed \npublicly by several state and local newspapers, including the The New York Times.    \n \n \nModel Approaches to Providing Services \n \nThe following model approach to providing services was reported by the hearing witness: \n \n•  The New York State Defenders Association, a non-profit membership organization of criminal \ndefense lawyers, has administered its Public Defense Backup Center with state funding since \n1981.  The Center provides technical assistance to indigent defense attorneys throughout \nthe state in the form of legal research, publications, training, and consultation.
