    "summary": "<p>On February 22, 2007, eight indigent felony defendants filed a 42 U.S.C. §1983 lawsuit against the State of Michigan and its governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, in a Michigan state court, specifically, the Circuit Court for Ingham County, Michigan.  The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and private counsel, requested class certification to represent a proposed class of all indigent adults who had been charged or would be charged with felonies in the District and Circuit Courts of Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon Counties and who relied or would rely on the Counties to provide them with counsel for their defense. </p><p>The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the State abdicated its constitutional and statutory responsibility by delegating responsibility for indigent defense to individual counties and failing to fund or provide oversight for such services.  Plaintiffs complained of a number of resulting deficiencies including: underfunding, inadequate training, overwhelming caseloads, and the lack of standards for performance and workload.  Plaintiffs claimed that the resulting system failed to provide indigent defendants with constitutionally adequate representation.  The plaintiffs requested that the court declare the current public defense system unconstitutional and order (via injunctive relief) that the State provide representation consistent with the requirements of the U.S. and Michigan constitutions.</p><p>On May 16, 2007, Judge Laura Baird of the Ingram County Circuit Court denied the state's motion to dismiss based on governmental immunity, and granted class certification. The state appealed.  On June 11, 2009, the Michigan Court of Appeals, in consolidated appeals of the trial court's decisions, affirmed the trial court on all counts, holding that the state is not shielded by governmental immunity and that the trial court properly certified the class.</p><p>Again, the State appealed, and on December 18, 2009, the Michigan Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, putting it on the April 2010 session calendar. Briefs of amici curiae were submitted  to the Michigan Supreme Court by the Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Brennan Center for Justice, the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, the Constitution Project and the University of Michigan Innocence Clinic.</p><p>On April 30, 2010, the Michigan Supreme Court, after hearing oral arguments, vacated the trial court's order granting the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and remanded the case to the Ingham Circuit Court for consideration of the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Also, the Michigan Supreme Court affirmed the result only of the Court of Appeals majority claiming that the defendants were not entitled to summary judgment as it was premature to make a decision on the substantive issues in the case. 780 N.W.2d 843. </p><p>In a surprising development, on July 16, 2010, the Michigan Supreme Court granted reconsideration and vacated its April 30, 2010 order thereby reversing the June 11, 2009 Court of Appeals decision for the reasons stated in that dissenting opinion including the plaintiffs' lack of standing. The order remanded the case to the Ingham Circuit Court, ordering entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. 784 N.W.2d 51.</p><p>On November 30, 2010, the Court again granted reconsideration, and reinstated the April 30 ruling, holding that first reconsideration was improperly granted. 790 N.W.2d 695. Two additional requests for reconsideration were denied.  791 N.W.2d 721 and 795 N.W.2d 820.</p><p>We have no further information about the progression of this case at the moment. However, on October 13, 2011, at least partly in response to this case and to campaigning by the ACLU of Michigan and other groups, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder issued an Executive Order establishing an 14-member Indigent Defense Advisory Commission charged with compiling a report on the status of indigent defense in the State and making recommendations on its improvement.</p><p>On June 22, 2012, the Commission released its report, finding that Michigan's history of delegating its responsibility to provide counsel to indigent defendants to the counties, as political-subdivisions of the State, had resulted in an uncoordinated, 83-county \"patchwork quilt\" with no standards as to the adequate of counsel or the level of funding. There was no State-level regulatory guidance as to what level of service would be constitutionally adequate. Most legal practitioners involved in the Michigan criminal justice system (judges, prosecutors, and indigent defense attorneys) who testified before the Commission acknowledged that the American Bar Association's recommendations for a minimally constitutionally adequate indigent defense system were not being met in Michigan. The report acknowledged Michigan ranked 44th in per capita indigent defense spending, spending 38% less than the national average. Only three of the State's 57 circuit courts funded indigent defense at or above the national average, and if it were to meet the national average the State would have to increase its total annual spending for indigent defense by nearly $50,000,000. The Commission recognized that the widespread inadequacy of indigent defense had led to higher than necessary levels of wrongful convictions, sentencing errors, and appeals resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel. It found that these avoidable errors cost the State millions of dollars.</p><p>Other recommendations included mandatory relevant continuing legal education for defense counsel, that defense counsel workloads be controlled and economic incentives encouraging the overburdening of attorneys be eliminated, and that defense counsel be provided with sufficient time and confidential space in order to consult with defendants.</p><p>The Commission recommended the State create a system that would ensure state-wide implementation of the ABA's minimum standards, and which would provide adequate funding. The Commission found that the creation of a new independent State agency, in the judicial branch, would be necessary to enforce these standards.</p><p>In June 2013, Michigan passed legislation establishing a permanent Michigan Indigent Defense Commission, largely following the recommendations of the earlier Commission's report. The commission will develop statewide standards, and the State will be obligated to provide funding to local county systems in order to maintain these standards if local funding is insufficient.</p><p></p>",

      "text": " \nMichigan Supreme Court to Hear Case on Public Defense System \nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: \nDecember 21, 2009 \n \nLANSING – In an order entered Friday, the Michigan Supreme Court agreed to hear the state’s \nappeal in a class action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union seeking to fix \nMichigan’s system for providing lawyers to poor people in criminal cases. In June 2009, a \nMichigan Court of Appeals rejected the state’s attempts to dismiss the lawsuit and allowed the \nlawsuit to proceed. \n \n“In a state where we spend more on prisons than on education, it is imperative that this broken \nsystem be fixed and that all those accused of a crime receive the same quality of justice no matter \nhow rich or poor,” said Kary L. Moss, ACLU of Michigan Executive Director. “We look \nforward to the opportunity to explain to the Michigan Supreme Court the need for our case to \nproceed so that justice is not delayed for poor people in the state.” \n \nEarlier this year, the state asked the Court of Appeals to dismiss the case for technical reasons, \narguing that the state was immune, that a class action is inappropriate and that the plaintiffs \ncould not sue until after they are convicted. The Court of Appeals rejected the state’s arguments \nrecognizing the plaintiffs must be given the opportunity to prove that the state has violated the \nConstitution.  \n \n“We cannot accept the proposition that the constitutional rights of our citizens, even those \naccused of crimes and too poor to afford counsel, are not deserving and worthy of any protection \nby the judiciary in a situation where the executive and legislative branches fail to comply with \nconstitutional mandates and abdicate their constitutional responsibilities,” wrote Michigan \nAppeals Court Judge William Murphy. \n \nIn February 2007, the ACLU filed a class action against the state on behalf of all indigent \ncriminal defendants in Berrien, Muskegon and Genesee Counties. The lawsuit was filed in \nIngham County Circuit Court and called on the court to declare the current public defense \nsystems of the three counties unconstitutional and compel the state to assure representation \nconsistent with national standards and constitutional norms.  \n \nIn May 2007, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Laura Baird rejected the state’s calls to \ndismiss the lawsuit, but the state appealed.  \n \nCurrently, Michigan provides no administrative oversight or funding for public defense at the \ntrial level, but delegates all responsibility to the counties. There is no state training for public \ndefense attorneys, no performance standards to govern their practice, and no review of their \n\nperformance. Moreover, many of the counties have been dramatically under-funding indigent \ndefense for years. The result is that in each of the three counties at issue in the suit - and indeed \nin many parts of Michigan - the public defense provided does not meet national standards or the \nconstitutional minimum requirements for effective assistance of counsel.  \n \nIn addition, many experts believe the state’s broken system is costly. Michigan spends almost $2 \nbillion dollars a year on prisons. Experts estimate that this amount is 40 percent higher than other \nstates due to unwarranted, inappropriately long sentences. In addition, the broken system leads to \nthe incarceration of innocent people. For instance, the case of Eddie Joe Lloyd, a man who \nserved 17 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, cost the state $4 million to settle a \nlawsuit upon his release. This figure doesn’t include the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent \nto incarcerate him or the amount the state spent prosecuting the case and defending the appeal. \n \nAttorneys for the class of indigent defendants include Moss, Mark Granzotto, Michael J. \nSteinberg, Mark Fancher and Jessie Rossman of the ACLU of Michigan, Frank Eaman of \nDetroit, Robin Dahlberg of the National ACLU, and Julie North, Misty Archambault and Sarita \nPrabhu of New York law firm of Cravath Moore & Swain. \n \nTo read the Michigan Supreme Court’s order granting the state’s application for leave to appeal, \ngo to: http://coa.courts.mi.gov/documents/SCT/PUBLIC/ORDERS/20091218_S139345_83... \n \nTo read the opinion, go to: \nhttp://coa.courts.mi.gov/documents/opinions/final/coa/20090611_c278652_7... \n \nTo read the ACLU brief on appeal, click here. \n \nTo read the complaint, click here.  \n ",

This is a civil rights class action brought pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution and Article 1, §§ 17 and 20 of the Michigan \nConstitution, on behalf of all indigent adults who have been charged or will be charged with \nfelonies in the District and Circuit Courts of Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon Counties1 and who \nrely or will rely on the State to provide them with counsel for their defense.  Plaintiffs seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants the State of Michigan and Jennifer M. \nGranholm, Governor of the State of Michigan, to prevent violations of Plaintiffs’ legal rights and \nto remedy Defendants’ continuing failure to ensure that Plaintiffs receive constitutionally \nadequate legal representation. \n2.  The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that in all \ncriminal prosecutions the accused shall have “the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.”  In the \nlandmark case of Gideon v Wainwright, 372 US 335 (1963), the Supreme Court established that \nthe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments require states to provide counsel for all those who have \nbeen charged with criminal wrongdoing by the state and are unable to afford private counsel.  \nThe Michigan Constitution similarly guarantees each criminal defendant the right to “have the \nassistance of counsel for his or her defense.”  Const 1963, art 1, § 20. \n3.  The right to assistance of counsel is the right to effective assistance of competent \ncounsel.  As the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear, “inadequate assistance \ndoes not satisfy the Sixth Amendment right to counsel made applicable to the States through the \n                                                 \n1 Berrien County encompasses the Second Circuit and Fifth District Courts, Genesee \nCounty encompasses the Seventh Circuit and Sixty-Seventh and Sixty-Eight District Courts, and \nMuskegon County encompasses the Fourteenth Circuit and Sixtieth District Courts.  The three \nCounties and the Courts that operate within them are collectively referred to in this Complaint as \nthe “Counties”. \n  2 \n \n \n\n \nFourteenth Amendment.”  Cuyler v Sullivan, 446 US 335, 344 (1980); see also McMann v \nRichardson, 397 US 759 (1970).  Constitutionally adequate counsel is counsel that is capable of \nputting the prosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  United States v \nCronic, 466 US 648, 656 (1984).  Where, as is the case in Michigan, defense counsel for indigent \npersons do not have the tools to engage actively and meaningfully in the adversarial process, \ncourts cannot ensure that their decisions, judgments, and punishments are rendered fairly and \naccurately. \n4.  This constitutional obligation to provide indigent defendants with adequate \ncounsel rests with the State.  Gideon v Wainwright, 372 US 335 (1963).  Michigan has abdicated \nits obligation under the United States and Michigan Constitutions by continuing a centuries-old \npractice of delegating to each of Michigan’s 83 counties the responsibility for funding and \nadministering trial-level indigent defense services within their borders, with little or no funding \nor fiscal or administrative oversight from the State. \n5.  Defendants do nothing to ensure that any county has the funding or the policies, \nprograms, guidelines, and other essential resources in place to enable the attorneys it hires to \nprovide constitutionally adequate legal representation.  Without any oversight from Defendants, \nmost county indigent defense services are seriously under-funded, poorly administered, and do \nnot ensure that indigent defense providers have the tools necessary to do their jobs. \n6.  The indigent defense services in Berrien, Muskegon and Genesee Counties have \nthe following deficiencies, among others: \na.  No written client eligibility standards; \nb.  No merit-based attorney hiring and retention programs; \nc.  No written attorney performance standards or meaningful systems of \nattorney supervision and monitoring; \n  3 \n \n \n\n \nd.  No guidelines on how to identify conflicts of interest; \ne.  No attorney workload standards; \nf.  No adequate attorney training; and \ng.  No independence from the judiciary or the prosecutorial function. \n7.  As a result of these deficiencies, many indigent defense providers in Berrien, \nMuskegon and Genesee Counties have too many cases; have insufficient support staff; have \neither no or insufficient resources to hire outside investigators and experts; and lack the skills \nand experience to handle the cases assigned to them. \n8.  The absence of manageable caseloads, necessary support, appropriate training, \nsupervision and monitoring, and written standards and guidelines creates severe obstacles to the \nability of indigent defense counsel to put the prosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful \nadversarial testing.  As a result of these systemic deficiencies, indigent defense counsel do not \nmeet with clients prior to critical stages in their criminal proceedings; investigate adequately the \ncharges against their clients or hire investigators who can assist with case preparation and testify \nat trial; file necessary pre-trial motions; prepare properly for court appearances; provide \nmeaningful representation at sentencings; or employ and consult with experts when necessary.  \nIn addition, the systemic deficiencies provide no method for ensuring that attorneys are \nrepresenting clients free from conflicts of interest. \n9.  The inability of indigent defense counsel to put the case against their clients to the \ncrucible of meaningful adversarial testing causes members of the Plaintiff Class to suffer \nnumerous harms, including but not limited to: \na.  Wrongful denial of representation; \nb.  Wrongful conviction of crimes; \nc.  Unnecessary or prolonged pre-trial detention; \n  4 \n \n \n\n \nd.  Guilty pleas to inappropriate charges and denial of the right to trial when \nmeritorious defenses are available; and \ne.  Harsher sentences than the facts of the case warrant and few alternatives to \nincarceration. \n10.  Defendants’ failure to take any steps to ensure that the indigent defense services \nin the Counties are adequately funded and administered, and that as a result, indigent defense \nproviders have the resources and tools necessary to do their jobs, is an abdication of Defendants’ \nconstitutional obligations, and the result is the denial of constitutionally adequate defense to \nindigent criminal defendants. \n11.  This Complaint focuses on how the Defendants’ failures to provide funding and \nfiscal and administrative oversight have created a broken indigent defense system in Berrien, \nGenesee, and Muskegon Counties; but the failings in those counties, and the types of harms \nsuffered by these Plaintiffs, are by no means limited or unique to the three Counties.  \nDefendants’ failure to provide funding or oversight to any of the State’s counties have caused \nsimilar problems throughout the State. \n12.  Pursuant to 42 USC 1983; the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution; Article 1, §§ 17 and 20 of the Michigan Constitution; and MCR 2.605 and \n3.310, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy the present and future \nconstitutional deficiencies in indigent defense services provided to adults charged with felonies \nat the trial court level in Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon Counties.  \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n13.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief pursuant to MCL 600.605, MCR 2.605, and MCR 3.310. \n  5 \n \n \n\n \n14.  This court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because Defendant \nGranholm is a public official of the State of Michigan who is sued in her official capacity in \norder to enforce the performance of her official duties, MCR 2.201, and the State has consented \nto be sued for violations of its own Constitution. \n15.  Venue is proper in this Court because some of the wrongs giving rise to this \naction occurred in Ingham County and each Defendant is located in Ingham County.  \n \nPARTIES \n \n  A.  Plaintiffs \n    1.  Christopher Lee Duncan (Berrien County) \n16.  Plaintiff CHRISTOPHER LEE DUNCAN is and at all times pertinent herein has \nbeen a resident of Benton Harbor, Michigan.  Mr. Duncan has a pending criminal case in the \nSecond Circuit Court in Berrien County.  Mr. Duncan is represented by an attorney who has \ncontracted with Berrien County to provide indigent defense services in that county. \n17.  Mr. Duncan was arrested on January 10, 2007, and charged with breaking and \nentering with intent to commit larceny, a felony.  The maximum sentence he faces is 10 years in \nprison.  Mr. Duncan met his indigent defense counsel for the first time on January 19, 2007, the \ndate scheduled for his preliminary examination.  Mr. Duncan spoke with his attorney for less \nthan five minutes in a holding cell below the courtroom, in the full hearing of numerous other \ninmates.   \n18.  At that meeting, Mr. Duncan’s attorney advised him to waive his preliminary \nexamination and plead guilty as charged, having entered into plea negotiations without first \ndiscussing with his client whether his client wished him to pursue a plea. \n  6 \n \n \n\n \n19.  Mr. Duncan is illiterate, and was neither provided with a copy of the police report \nnor informed of the contents of that report.  Mr. Duncan’s lawyer did not discuss with Mr. \nDuncan the police report, the accuracy or the charge against Mr. Duncan or possible defenses to \nthat charge.  Had he done so, the attorney may have recognized that Mr. Duncan had a valid \ndefense that required investigation.  \n20.  Without any further meaningful conversations with his attorney and without fully \nunderstanding the nature of his plea agreement, Mr. Duncan waived his preliminary examination \nand pleaded guilty to the charged offense of breaking and entering with intent, which is a more \nserious charge than the facts of his case warranted.  At the hearing, Mr. Duncan’s attorney urged \nMr. Duncan to admit to facts that Mr. Duncan at first refused to plead to, in order to support the \nplea of guilty that the attorney recommended.     \n21.  Mr. Duncan’s sentencing is scheduled for March 12, 2007.  Mr. Duncan’s \nattorney has yet to prepare Mr. Duncan for the sentencing hearing or to discuss with Mr. Duncan \nstrategies to minimize his sentence.   \n22.  Mr. Duncan has not been provided with the legal representation to which he is \nconstitutionally entitled, insofar as he had no opportunity to discuss with his attorney the factual \nbasis for the charge against him before pleading guilty, to participate in building a defense to that \ncharge, to make an informed decision about whether to plead guilty to the charge, and to discuss \nwith his lawyer mitigating factors that could reduce his sentence.  On information and belief, Mr. \nDuncan’s attorney will fail to prepare for Mr. Duncan’s sentencing and will fail to advocate \nmeaningfully for a reduced sentence for Mr. Duncan. \n \n \n  7 \n \n \n\n \n    2.  Billy Joe Burr, Jr. (Berrien County) \n23.  Plaintiff BILLY JOE BURR, JR. is and at all times pertinent herein has been a \nresident of Niles, Michigan.  Mr. Burr has a pending criminal case in the Second Circuit Court in \nBerrien County and is incarcerated at the Berrien County Jail.  Mr. Burr is represented by an \nattorney who has contracted with Berrien County to provide indigent defense services in that \ncounty. \n24.  Mr. Burr was arrested on January 15, 2007, and charged with unlawfully driving \naway in an automobile, a felony.  Mr. Burr was charged as a second habitual offender, and the \nmaximum sentence Mr. Burr faced for this charge was 3 years in prison.  Mr. Burr met his \nindigent defense counsel for the first time at his pre-examination conference.  Mr. Burr spoke \nwith his attorney for approximately five minutes. \n25.  At that meeting, Mr. Burr’s attorney presented him with a plea offer, having \nentered into plea negotiations without first discussing with his client whether his client wished \nhim to pursue a plea.  That plea offer required Mr. Burr to plead guilty as charged, despite the \nfact that the attorney had not conducted any investigation into the charge against Mr. Burr and \nhad not discussed with Mr. Burr the accuracy of the charge or possible defenses to that charge.   \nHad he done either, or held the preliminary examination, the attorney may have recognized that \nMr. Burr had a valid defense that required investigation.  Mr. Burr’s attorney terminated the \nmeeting when Mr. Burr refused to plead guilty to a felony. \n26.  On January 23, 2007, the date scheduled for Mr. Burr’s preliminary examination, \nMr. Burr’s attorney again presented Mr. Burr with the same plea offer.  Only on Mr. Burr’s \ninsistence did his attorney speak with the prosecutor, who then offered to reduce the charge.  Mr. \n  8 \n \n \n\n \nBurr then waived his preliminary examination and pleaded guilty to unlawful use of an \nautomobile, a two-year misdemeanor.   \n27.  Mr. Burr’s sentencing is scheduled for March 5, 2007.  Mr. Burr’s attorney has \nyet to prepare Mr. Burr for the sentencing hearing or to discuss with Mr. Burr strategies to \nminimize his sentence.   \n28.  As a result of Defendants’ failures, Mr. Burr’s attorney is unable to put the \nprosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  Mr. Burr had no opportunity \nto discuss with his attorney the factual basis for the charge against him, to participate in building \na defense to that charge, to make an informed decision about whether to plead guilty to the \ncharge, and to discuss with his lawyer mitigating factors that could reduce his sentence.  On \ninformation and belief, Mr. Burr’s attorney will fail to prepare for Mr. Burr’s sentencing and will \nfail to advocate meaningfully for a reduced sentence for Mr. Burr. \n \n    3.  Steven Connor (Berrien County) \n29.  Plaintiff STEVEN CONNOR is and at all times pertinent herein has been a \nresident of Benton Harbor, Michigan.  Mr. Connor has a pending criminal case in the Second \nCircuit Court in Berrien County and is incarcerated at the Berrien County Jail.  Mr. Connor is \nrepresented by an attorney who has contracted with Berrien County to provide indigent defense \nservices in that county. \n30.  Mr. Connor was arrested on January 20, 2007, and charged with manufacturing \nmethamphetamines and manufacturing methamphetamines within 500 feet of a residence, \nfelonies which subject him to a potential maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.   \n  9 \n \n \n\n \n31.  Mr. Connor’s arrest occurred after police officers entered his hotel room.  Upon \nentry, the officers conducted a warrantless search of the hotel room, discovering drug \nparaphernalia that was not in plain view. \n32.  Mr. Connor met his indigent defense counsel for the first time at his pre-\nexamination conference.  Mr. Connor spoke with his attorney in a holding cell below the \ncourtroom, in the full hearing of numerous other inmates, including one of Mr. Connor’s co-\ndefendants.  Mr. Connor was not comfortable discussing the details of his case in the presence of \nthat co-defendant. \n33.  At that meeting, Mr. Connor’s attorney advised him that he faced a minimum of \n51 to 73 months in prison and a maximum of 40 years.  Mr. Connor asked his attorney whether \nhe had received a copy of the police report, and his attorney informed him that he had not.  Mr. \nConnor’s lawyer did not attempt to discuss with Mr. Connor the circumstances of his arrest, the \naccuracy of the charges against Mr. Connor or possible defenses to those charges.  Had he done \nso, the attorney may have recognized that Mr. Connor had a valid defense that required \ninvestigation.  \n34.  Mr. Connor’s trial is scheduled for March 22 and 23, 2007.  Mr. Connor’s \nattorney has failed to file a motion to suppress evidence of the alleged offense.  Mr. Connor’s \nattorney has not met with him to discuss preparation for trial and potential defenses or to inform \nhim about developments in his case.  Notwithstanding the fact that one of Mr. Connor’s co-\ndefendants received a plea offer from the prosecutor, Mr. Connor’s attorney has failed to \nnegotiate a plea offer.  On information and belief Mr. Connor’s attorney has done nothing to \nprepare for Mr. Connor’s trial. \n  10 \n \n \n\n \n35.  As a result of Defendants’ failures, Mr. Connor’s attorney is unable to put the \nprosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  Mr. Connor has had \ninsufficient opportunity to discuss with his attorney the circumstances of his arrest and the \nfactual basis for the charges against him and to participate in building a defense to those charges.  \nMr. Connor has also been deprived of the ability to negotiate a favorable plea. \n \n    4.  Antonio Taylor (Berrien County) \n36.  Plaintiff ANTONIO TAYLOR is and at all times pertinent herein has been a \nresident of Benton Harbor, Michigan.  Mr. Taylor has a pending criminal case in the Second \nCircuit Court in Berrien County and is incarcerated at the Berrien County Jail.  Mr. Taylor is \nrepresented by an attorney who has contracted with Berrien County to provide indigent defense \nservices in that county. \n37.  Mr. Taylor was arrested on December 16, 2006, and charged with carrying a \nconcealed weapon in an automobile, a felony.  Mr. Taylor was also charged with two related \nmisdemeanors: reckless use of a firearm and failure to present a pistol for inspection.  Mr. Taylor \nwas charged as a third habitual offender, and faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. \n38.  At the time of his arrest, there were five others in the car with Mr. Taylor and the \ngun was on the floor of the car under a passenger seat.  Mr. Taylor was the only occupant of the \ncar known to the arresting officer, and the only occupant arrested. \n39.  Mr. Taylor met his indigent defense counsel on December 27, 2007, and spoke \nwith him for approximately five minutes in a holding cell below the courthouse, in the full \nhearing of numerous other inmates.   \n  11 \n \n \n\n \n40.  At that meeting, Mr. Taylor’s attorney advised him to waive his preliminary \nexamination and plead to the original felony charge, having entered into plea negotiations \nwithout first discussing with his client whether his client wished him to pursue a plea.  Mr. \nTaylor’s attorney had not conducted any investigation into the charges against Mr. Taylor and \nhad not discussed with Mr. Taylor the accuracy of the charges or possible defenses to those \ncharges.  Had he done either, the attorney might have recognized that Mr. Taylor had a valid \ndefense that required investigation, and that the case involved forensic evidence that required \nscientific testing, as well as numerous witness statements that also required investigation. \n41.  On December 28, 2007, Mr. Taylor’s preliminary examination was held.  At the \nconclusion of his preliminary examination, Mr. Taylor was bound over to the circuit court on the \ncharged offenses.   \n42.   Since his preliminary examination Mr. Taylor’s attorney has met with him once, \non January 12, 2007, in a holding cell in full hearing of other inmates, to convey a plea offer that \nwould involve Mr. Taylor pleading to a reduced charge of attempted carrying and concealing a \nweapon in an automobile in exchange for dropping the two misdemeanor charges.  Mr. Taylor \nrejected the plea offer. \n43.  Mr. Taylor’s case is scheduled for trial on March 2, 2007.  Mr. Taylor’s attorney \nhas not met with him to discuss preparation for trial and potential defenses or to inform him \nabout developments in his case.  On information and belief, Mr. Taylor’s attorney has failed to \nfile motions to suppress evidence of the alleged offense and for necessary discovery, and has \nfailed to demand independent scientific examination of the prosecution’s evidence.  On \ninformation and belief Mr. Taylor’s attorney has not conducted any investigation into the \n  12 \n \n \n\n \nprosecutor’s allegations underlying the charges and has done nothing to prepare for Mr. Taylor’s \ntrial. \n44.  As a result of Defendants’ failures, Mr. Taylor’s attorney is unable to put the \nprosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  Mr. Taylor has had \ninsufficient opportunity to discuss with his attorney the factual basis for the charges against him \nand to participate in building a defense to those charges, and has been deprived of investigative \nand expert assistance that may contribute to his exoneration of the charged offenses. \n \n    5.  Jose Davila (Genesee County) \n45.  Plaintiff JOSE DAVILA is and at all times pertinent herein has been a resident of \nFlint, Michigan.  Mr. Davila has a pending criminal case in the Seventh Circuit Court in Genesee \nCounty and is incarcerated at the Genesee County Jail.  Mr. Davila is represented by a member \nof the private bar who has been appointed by the Defender Administrator for the Seventh Circuit \nCourt to provide indigent defense representation to Mr. Davila. \n46.  Mr. Davila was arrested on December 10, 2006, when he attempted to enter his \nniece’s home and was attacked by a group of people from a neighboring house, one of whom \nwas wielding a baseball bat.  As a result of this incident, Mr. Davila was charged with first-\ndegree home invasion, a felony, and assault and battery, a misdemeanor.   \n47.  Mr. Davila met his indigent defense counsel for the first time five minutes before \nhis arraignment.  While Mr. Davila requested an opportunity to confer with his attorney at that \ntime, his attorney left immediately after the arraignment without speaking with Mr. Davila. \n48.  On December 22, 2006, Mr. Davila’s preliminary examination was held and he \nwas bound over to the circuit court on a charge of third-degree home invasion, a felony, and \n  13 \n \n \n\n \nthree related misdemeanors: malicious destruction of a building, trespassing, and jostling.  These \ncharges expose Mr. Davila to a maximum of 5 years in prison.  Mr. Davila’s attorney failed to \nprepare for the preliminary investigation, made no arguments to the court as the charges against \nMr. Davila were revised, and failed to explain to Mr. Davila the significance of those revisions.  \nMr. Davila’s attorney also informed the court that he had discussed the charges with Mr. Davila, \nalthough he had not.  The court proceeded to read to Mr. Davila the contents of the felony \ninformation.  Mr. Davila’s attorney again left court without speaking with his client. \n49.  Another court hearing was held in Mr. Davila’s case on February 5.  Again, Mr. \nDavila was afforded no opportunity to speak with his attorney in advance.  At that hearing, the \ncourt ordered Mr. Davila’s attorney to meet with Mr. Davila to discuss the charges.  On \ninformation and belief, Mr. Davila’s attorney has still not met with him. \n50.  Mr. Davila’s case is scheduled for trial on March 16.  Mr. Davila’s attorney has \nnot spoken with Mr. Davila about the accuracy of the charges against him or possible defenses to \nthose charges, and on information and belief has failed to perform any factual investigation of \nMr. Davila’s case or interview numerous witnesses to the alleged offense.  Had he done any of \nthese things, the attorney might have recognized that Mr. Davila has a valid defense that required \ninvestigation. \n51.  As a result of Defendants’ failures, Mr. Davila’s attorney is unable to put the \nprosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  Mr. Davila has had no \nopportunity to discuss with his attorney the factual basis for the charges against him and to \nparticipate in building a defense to those charges and has been deprived of investigative \nassistance that may contribute to his exoneration of the charged offenses.  On information and \nbelief, Mr. Davila’s attorney will fail to prepare for Mr. Davila’s trial. \n  14 \n \n \n\n \n    6.  Jennifer O’Sullivan (Genesee County) \n52.  Plaintiff JENNIFER O’SULLIVAN is and at all times pertinent herein has been a \nresident of Flint, Michigan.  Mrs. O’Sullivan has a pending criminal case in the Sixty-Seventh \nDistrict Court in Genesee County and is incarcerated at the Genesee County Jail.  Mrs. \nO’Sullivan is represented by a member of the private bar who has been appointed by the \nDefender Administrator for the Seventh Circuit Court to provide indigent defense representation \nto Mrs. O’Sullivan. \n53.  Mrs. O’Sullivan was arrested on August 15, 2006, and charged with two counts of \nsolicitation of murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder, all of which are felonies \nthat carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.  Mrs. O’Sullivan has no prior criminal record—\nthese charges stem from threats made against her and her young daughter by a neighbor’s \nboyfriend.  She met her indigent defense counsel for the first time on August 24, 2006, the day \nbefore her pre-trial hearing.  They spoke for approximately ten minutes.  Mrs. O’Sullivan’s \nattorney asked her no questions about the facts of her case, potential witnesses, or potential \navenues of investigation or defense.   \n54.  Mrs. O’Sullivan saw her attorney again on September 5, when he requested that \nshe waive her right to have a preliminary examination within fourteen days of arraignment, even \nthough twenty-one days had already passed since her arraignment.  Mrs. O’Sullivan \nsubsequently signed the waiver form. \n55.  Mrs. O’Sullivan met with her attorney again on September 8.  Mrs. O’Sullivan \nhas not spoken to or heard from her attorney since September 8.  She has not yet had a \npreliminary examination and has not been bound over to the circuit court.  Mrs. O’Sullivan’s \nfamily members have repeatedly sought to contact her attorney on her behalf, but he has not \n  15 \n \n \n\n \nreturned any of their calls.  Mrs. O’Sullivan wishes to replace her attorney but is unable to \nbecause she cannot afford to retain an attorney. \n56.  As a result of Defendants’ failures, Mrs. O’Sullivan’s attorney is unable to put the \nprosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  Mrs. O’Sullivan has not \nheard from her attorney in over five months, has had insufficient opportunity to discuss with her \nattorney the factual basis for the charges against her, has had no opportunity to participate in \nbuilding a defense to those charges, and does not understand where her case stands or the status \nof the charges against her.   \n \n    7.  Christopher Manies (Muskegon County) \n57.  Plaintiff CHRISTOPHER MANIES is and at all times pertinent herein has been a \nresident of Muskegon, Michigan.  Mr. Manies has a pending criminal case in the Fourteenth \nCircuit Court in Muskegon County.  Mr. Manies is represented by an attorney who has \ncontracted with Muskegon County to provide indigent defense services in that county. \n58.  Mr. Manies was arrested on January 10, 2007, and charged with second-degree \nhome invasion, attempting to disarm a peace officer, and resisting and obstructing and assaulting \na police officer, all of which are felonies.  Mr. Manies was charged as a second habitual \noffender, and is subject to a potential maximum sentence of 22 1/2 years in prison.   \n59.  The charges against Mr. Manies stem from allegations that Mr. Manies shoved a \npolice officer who had drawn a gun on him during an alleged home invasion, and that Mr. \nManies then led the police officer on a chase that allegedly ended in Mr. Manies successfully \nfleeing.  Mr. Manies was arrested the following day when he learned the police were looking for \nhim and voluntarily turned himself in. \n  16 \n \n \n\n \n60.  Mr. Manies met his indigent defense counsel for the first time at a pre-preliminary \nexamination conference.  Mr. Manies spoke with his attorney for approximately two minutes.  \nMr. Manies’ lawyer did not attempt to discuss with Mr. Manies the facts of his case, the accuracy \nof the charges against Mr. Manies or possible defenses to those charges.  Had he done so, the \nattorney may have recognized that Mr. Manies had a valid defense that required investigation.  \n61.  On January 25, 2007, the date scheduled for Mr. Manies’ preliminary \nexamination, he met his lawyer for the second time, for approximately five minutes.  Again, Mr. \nManies lawyer made no effort to discuss the case or possible defenses, despite Mr. Manies’ \neagerness to do so.  Mr. Manies subsequently waived his preliminary examination and was \nbound over to the circuit court on the charged offenses. \n62.  Mr. Manies has not heard from his lawyer since January 25, despite having \nwritten to him several times.  Mr. Manies has learned that he has been assigned new counsel, but \nhas not heard from that attorney.  Mr. Manies’ attorney has not met with him to discuss \npreparation for trial and potential defenses or to inform him about developments in his case, \nincluding when he is next scheduled to appear in court and whether his case is scheduled for \ntrial.  On information and belief Mr. Manies’ attorney has not conducted any investigation into \nthe prosecutor’s allegations underlying the charges and has done nothing to prepare for Mr. \nManies’ trial.   \n63.  As a result of Defendants’ failures, Mr. Manies’ attorney is unable to put the \nprosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  Mr. Manies has had \ninsufficient opportunity to discuss with his attorney the factual basis for the charges against him \nand to participate in building a defense to those charges.  Mr. Manies also does not understand \nwhere his case stands or the status of the charges against him. \n  17 \n \n \n\n \n    8.  Brian Secrest (Muskegon County) \n64.  Plaintiff BRIAN SECREST is and at all times pertinent herein has been a resident \nof Wyoming, Michigan.  Mr. Secrest has a pending criminal case in the Fourteenth Circuit Court \nin Muskegon County and is incarcerated at the Muskegon County Jail.  Mr. Secrest is \nrepresented by an attorney hired pursuant to a contract with Muskegon County to provide \nindigent defense services in that county. \n65.  Mr. Secrest was arrested on November 28, 2006, and charged with armed robbery \nas a second habitual offender, which exposes him to a maximum sentence of life in prison.  Mr. \nSecrest met his indigent defense counsel for the first time on the date scheduled for his \npreliminary examination, and spoke with him for approximately two minutes.  Mr. Secrest’s \nattorney did not discuss with Mr. Secrest the accuracy of the charges or possible defenses to \nthose charges.   \n66.  Mr. Secrest waived his preliminary examination on December 21, 2006.  Mr. \nSecrest had a pretrial conference scheduled for January 23, 2007, but did not see his lawyer on \nthat date, or at any time since.  Mr. Secrest subsequently wrote to his lawyer asking for \ninformation about his case, and has received no response.   \n67.  As a result of Defendants’ failures, Mr. Secrest’s attorney is unable to put the \nprosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  Mr. Secrest has had \ninsufficient opportunity to discuss with his attorney the factual basis for the charges against him \nand has had no opportunity to participate in building a defense to those charges. \n \n  B.  Defendants \n68.  Defendant STATE OF MICHIGAN is sued for violations of the State \nConstitution.  See MCR 2.201(C)(5); see also Gaertner v State, 24 Mich App 503, aff’d 385 \n  18 \n \n \n\n \nMich 49 (1971); and Burdette v State, 166 Mich App 406 (1988).  The State Capitol and center \nof State government is in Ingham County. \n69.  Defendant JENNIFER M. GRANHOLM (“Defendant Governor”) is Governor of \nMichigan and is sued in her official capacity as to all claims.  Pursuant to Article V, § 1 of the \nConstitution of Michigan of 1963, the executive power of the State is vested in the Governor. \nThe Michigan Constitution further provides that the Governor shall take care that applicable \nfederal and state laws are faithfully executed.  Const 1963, art 5, § 8.  The Michigan Constitution \nalso provides that the Governor shall submit to the legislature a budget that sets forth proposed \nState expenditures for each fiscal period.  Const 1963, art 5, § 18.  Governor Granholm maintains \nher principal office at the Office of the Governor, 111 S. Capitol Avenue, George W. Romney \nBuilding, Lansing, Michigan 48933, which is in Ingham County. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n70.  This action is properly brought as a class action pursuant to MCR 3.501. \n71.  The Class is defined as all indigent adult persons who have been charged with or \nwill be charged with felonies in the District and Circuit Courts of Berrien, Genesee, and \nMuskegon Counties and who rely or will rely on the Counties to provide them with defense \nservices.  The Class includes all indigent adults against whom felony criminal charges will be \nbrought in Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon Counties during the pendency of this action. \n72.  The Class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impractical.  At any point in \ntime, hundreds of indigent adults with criminal cases pending in each of the three Counties rely \non appointed indigent defense counsel for legal representation. \n73.  The questions of law and fact raised by the named Plaintiffs’ claims are common \nto, and typical of, those raised by the Class they seek to represent.  Each Plaintiff relies on the \n  19 \n \n \n\n \nState for legal representation during the course of his or her felony proceedings, and is harmed \nby the Defendants’ failure to provide funding and fiscal and administrative oversight to \nMichigan’s indigent criminal defense system.  \n74.  Questions of fact common to the Class include: \na.  whether Defendants have failed to take the steps necessary to ensure that \nthe three Counties provide the attorneys they hire to represent indigent \nadults accused of felony wrongdoing with the tools necessary to enable \nthose attorneys to put the prosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful \nadversarial testing; \nb.  whether Defendants’ failure to take such steps has resulted in the inability \nof indigent defense counsel in the three Counties to provide \nconstitutionally adequate legal representation to members of the Plaintiff \nClass; and \nc.  whether, as a result of such failures by Defendants, members of the \nPlaintiff Class are harmed by the inability of indigent defense counsel to \nprovide them with constitutionally adequate legal representation. \n75.  Questions of law common to the Class include: \na.  whether Michigan is violating its obligation under the Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to ensure that \nindigent defense providers have the tools necessary to provide indigent \nadults accused of felonies in state court proceedings in the three Counties \nwith constitutionally adequate representation; and \nb.  whether Michigan is violating its obligation under the Michigan \nConstitution to ensure that indigent defense providers have the tools \nnecessary to provide indigent adults accused of felonies in state court \nproceedings in the three Counties with constitutionally adequate legal \nrepresentation.  \n76.  The violations of law and resulting harms alleged by the named Plaintiffs are \ntypical of the legal violations and harms suffered by all Class members. \n77.  Plaintiff Class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs’ counsel know of no conflicts of interest between the class \nrepresentatives and absent class members with respect to the matters at issue in this litigation; the \n  20 \n \n \n\n \nclass representatives will vigorously prosecute the suit on behalf of the Class; and the class \nrepresentatives are represented by experienced counsel.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys \nemployed by the American Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”) and the ACLU of Michigan, \nnonprofit legal organizations whose attorneys have substantial experience and expertise in \nindigent criminal defense matters; and Frank D. Eaman PLLC, a private law firm with extensive \nexperience in criminal litigation.  Plaintiffs will also be represented by Cravath, Swaine & Moore \nLLP, a law firm with extensive complex civil litigation experience, if pro hac vice motions are \ngranted.  Plaintiffs’ attorneys have identified and thoroughly investigated all claims in this \naction, and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class. \n78.  The maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available \nmethods of adjudication and will promote the convenient administration of justice.  Moreover, \nthe prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class could result in \ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the Class and/or one \nor more of the Defendants. \n79.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to all \nPlaintiffs, necessitating declaratory and injunctive relief for the Class. \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES \nIN THE CRIMINAL INDIGENT DEFENSE SYSTEM \nTHAT HARM PLAINTIFFS \nI.  National and Michigan-Based Legal Organizations Have Long Recognized the \nPrerequisites for Constitutionally Adequate Indigent Defense Services. \n80.  There is a national consensus on both the requirements of adequate indigent \ndefense delivery systems and the task indigent defense providers must undertake to provide \nconstitutionally adequate legal representation. \n  21 \n \n \n\n \n81.  In the 1970s, the American Bar Association (“ABA”) and the National Legal Aid \nand Defender Association (“NLADA”) promulgated performance standards for indigent defense \ncounsel.  Those standards, which are periodically updated, require, among other things, that \nindigent defense counsel:  (a) have adequate knowledge of the relevant areas of the law; (b) act \nwith reasonable diligence and promptness, avoiding unnecessary delay in the disposition of \ncases; (c) provide representation at every critical stage of their clients’ proceedings; (d) conduct \nreasonable factual and legal pre-trial investigations into the charges against their clients, pursue \navailable formal and informal discovery procedures, and use appropriate and necessary experts; \nand (e) consult with their clients in order to elicit relevant information about the case, to inform \nclients of their rights, and to enable clients to make informed decisions about the direction of \ntheir cases. \n82.  In 2002, the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association (“ABA”) \napproved the Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System (the “Ten Principles”), \nestablishing the fundamental criteria necessary for an indigent defense system to provide \neffective, efficient, ethical, and conflict-free legal representation to its clients.  Based upon the \nwork of the Director of the Michigan State Appellate Defender Office and earlier standards \npertaining to the administration of indigent defense programs promulgated by the ABA and the \nNLADA, the Ten Principles reflect a national consensus regarding the prerequisites for \nconstitutionally adequate indigent defense, reached by representatives from each of the fifty \nstates, the civil bar, and all segments of the criminal justice system—including judges, \nprosecutors, private defense counsel, public defenders, court personnel, and academics active in \ncriminal justice. \n  22 \n \n \n\n \n83.  Among other things, the Ten Principles state that: (a) defense counsel should be \nan equal partner in the justice system, with the same resources as prosecuting attorneys; (b) only \nqualified counsel should represent indigent defendants; (c) clients should be appropriately \nscreened for eligibility for public defense services; (d) defense counsel should receive the \ntraining necessary to perform competently; (e) there should be attorney performance standards \nand adequate supervision and oversight to ensure compliance with those standards; (f) workloads \nshould be monitored; and (g) indigent defense systems should be independent from undue \npolitical influence, to ensure that counsel are free to make the decisions necessary to advocate \nmeaningfully for their clients. \n84.  In 2002, the State Bar of Michigan adopted the Eleven Principles of a Public \nDefense Delivery System (the “Eleven Principles”).  The Eleven Principles, which were modeled \non the ABA’s Ten Principles, add as an Eleventh Principle that one of the functions of indigent \ndefense should be to explore and advocate for programs that improve the indigent defense \nsystem and reduce recidivism. \n \nII.  Defendants Have Long Known of the Urgent Need for Systemic Reform of \nMichigan’s Indigent Defense System. \n85.  Although the constitutional obligation to provide indigent persons with effective \nassistance of competent counsel rests with the State, Defendants have repeatedly abdicated that \nresponsibility.  Report after report has called attention to the fact that Michigan’s delegation of \nits constitutional obligation to its Counties without appropriate funding or fiscal and \nadministrative oversight has resulted in serious deficiencies. \n86.  In 1978, 1986, 1992, 2002 and again in 2003, various statewide and local \ncommittees and task forces—including a task force appointed by the Defendant Governor \n  23 \n \n \n\n \nherself—have condemned the same deficiencies in Michigan’s indigent defense system as those \nupon which Plaintiffs base this Complaint.  Each has recommended the adoption of statewide \nstandards and/or the creation of a statewide indigent defense commission.  National and state-\nlevel studies and news reports have similarly decried the state of the system in Michigan.  \nDefendants have disregarded each report and set of recommendations.  For example: \na.  In 1986, Michigan State Bar President George T. Roumell, Jr., established \nMichigan’s Special State Bar Task Force on Assigned Counsel Standards.  \nThe recommendations of the 1986 Task Force were published in the \nMichigan Bar Journal in September 1986, under the title “Minimum \nStandards for Court-Appointed Criminal Trial Counsel.”  These minimum \nstandards were subsequently approved by the Michigan State Bar’s Board \nof Commissioners and representative Assembly.  The Task Force noted \nthe lack of statewide standards in contrast to other states throughout the \ncountry and recommended specific standards, including ones governing \ncaseloads, conflicts of interest, the preservation of attorney-client \nprivilege, practice standards, access to experts and investigators, the \nattorney client working relationship, pretrial motions, plea negotiations, \nand sentencing.  The Task Force also recommended state funding for \nindigent defense services. \nb.  The Michigan Bar Journal dedicated its February 1992 issue to the state \nof indigent defense services in Michigan.  The first article, by Thomas E. \nDaniels, a former prosecuting attorney, was entitled “Gideon’s Hollow \nPromise—How Appointed Counsel Are Prevented From Fulfilling Their \nRole in the Criminal Justice System,” and observed, among other things, \nthat “the methods we use to appoint, pay, train and supervise appointed \ncounsel virtually guarantee that many will not perform their role \neffectively, to the detriment of their clients and the criminal justice system \nitself.” \nc.  In December 2004, the American Bar Association Committee on Legal \nAid and Indigent Defendants published Gideon’s Broken Promise:  \nAmerica’s Quest for Equal Justice.  This report singled out Michigan as \nthe only state for which funding information could not be gathered. \nd.  On February 28, 2005, Michigan Lawyers Weekly published an article \ntitled “Indigent Criminal Services Strained by ‘Underfunding.’”  The \narticle noted that prosecutors, judges, criminal defense practitioners, \nlegislators and citizens acknowledge that the underfunding of indigent \ncriminal defense services in Michigan is a serious and growing problem.  \n  24 \n \n \n\n \n87.  As Michigan State Bar President Thomas W. Cranmer noted in a 2006 Michigan \nBar Journal article, despite the State’s highly publicized deficiencies and the above-mentioned \nrecommendations, “little has changed . . . .  Currently Michigan has no statewide standards or \nfunding structure to assure adequate representation.  In recent national reviews of indigent \ndefense systems, Michigan has ranked among the lowest in terms of providing adequate support \nand structure to its defense system.”  \n \nIII.  Defendants Provide Inadequate Funding and No Fiscal Oversight to Michigan’s \nIndigent Defense System. \n88.  Michigan provides no funding specifically for the provision of indigent defense \nservices in felony criminal actions at the trial stage in the three Counties or any other county in \nthe State.  To the extent that state funding is used by the Counties to pay for indigent defense \nservices, Defendants do not ensure that such funding is spent appropriately.  And to the extent \nthat the Counties provide funding of their own, Defendants do not provide the Counties with any \noversight or guidance to ensure that such funding produces an indigent defense system capable \nof providing constitutionally adequate indigent defense services. \n89.  On an annual basis, Michigan allocates monies to a Court Equity Fund, \nadministered by the State Court Administrative Office (“SCAO”), to help the Counties, and the \nother counties in Michigan, pay for trial court operations expenses (which include indigent \ndefense expenses).  The amount allocated is grossly insufficient.  For example, the monies \nallocated to Muskegon County in 2006 and to Berrien County in 2004 barely covered one-\nseventh of the Counties’ actual expenses. \n  25 \n \n \n\n \n90.  Counties are permitted to allocate those funds within their court systems any way \nthey choose.  Defendants do not ensure that any of those funds are spent on indigent defense and \ndo not maintain records as to whether in fact any of those funds are spent on indigent defense. \n91.  In direct contrast to its fiscal approach to indigent criminal defense, Michigan \ndesignates funding and provides fiscal oversight for the prosecutorial function at the trial level.  \nMichigan has provided the Prosecuting Attorneys Coordinating Council with millions of dollars \nover the last ten years (and $2.2 million in 2007 alone) to help ensure that prosecutors \ncompetently perform their prosecutorial function.  For example, funding has been provided and \ndesignated for professional training of all prosecutors’ staff; to publish newsletters to keep \nprosecutors informed of the most recent legislative, judicial, and technical changes affecting their \nduties; to provide legal research assistance for prosecutors; and to install and upgrade automated \nwork management systems in prosecutors’ offices to help manage tasks such as issuing \nsubpoenas, keeping track of court schedules, and running statistics and managerial reports.  No \nsuch state resources or state funding for such resources exist for indigent defense counsel. \n92.  Michigan also provides $28 million per year to the Michigan State Police \nForensic Science Division, which provides free investigative and expert witness services to \nprosecutors.  The Division, which has seventeen offices across the State, provides crime scene \ninvestigations, drug analysis, document examination, polygraph testing, latent print examination, \nDNA analysis, toxicology analyses, blood/alcohol analyses, firearms and tool mark examination, \narson evidence analyses, serology, and trace evidence analyses.  The Division employs over 200 \nworkers who also serve as experts for the prosecution in court cases.  In 2005, the Division \nprocessed over 100,000 cases and offered expert testimony in nearly 1,000 court cases on behalf \nof the prosecution.  Indigent defense counsel have no access to the Forensic Sciences Division, \n  26 \n \n \n\n \nand there are no comparable state resources or state funding for such resources for indigent \ndefense counsel. \n \nIV.  Defendants Exercise No Administrative Oversight Over Michigan’s Indigent \nDefense System. \n93.  There is effectively no state supervision over the provision of indigent defense \nservices in felony criminal actions at the trial level in any of the three Counties or anywhere else \nin Michigan. \n94.  Defendants do not require that the manner in which indigent defense services are \nprovided in the three Counties complies with the Ten Principles or the Eleven Principles.  Nor do \nDefendants require that indigent defense counsel providing representation at the trial level in the \nthree Counties comply with any of the nationally recognized performance standards.  There are \nno statewide standards regarding eligibility for indigent defense counsel, and few if any \nresources provided for attorney training.  There is no statewide supervision, attorney \nperformance evaluation, workload limitations, or access to resources for the defense function.  \nThe result is a broken system that does not meet the constitutional standard for providing \nadequate legal representation to Plaintiffs in the three Counties. \n95.  While Michigan has promulgated court rules through which, in theory, \nDefendants could exercise some oversight over the indigent defense system, Defendants neither \nenforce the rules nor make effective use of the information provided to them pursuant to those \nrules.  Michigan Court Rule 8.123(B) requires that each trial court submit to the SCAO for \napproval an “administrative order that describes the court’s procedures for selecting, appointing, \nand compensating counsel who represent indigent parties in that court.”  Michigan Court Rule \n8.123(C) requires the SCAO to approve only those orders whose “provisions will protect the \n  27 \n \n \n\n \nintegrity of the judiciary.”  The SCAO has routinely approved the administrative orders sent by \neach of the three Counties, even when they provide for procedures that deprive indigent \ndefendants—including Plaintiffs—of constitutionally adequate legal representation.  The SCAO \nthus fails to protect the integrity of the judiciary, and Defendants do nothing to ensure that the \nSCAO fulfills this duty. \n96.  Michigan Court Rule 8.123(D) requires that each trial court submit to the SCAO \nan electronic report of the total public funds paid to each attorney and/or contracting entity \nproviding legal services to indigent persons.  The Fourteenth Circuit Court in Muskegon County \nhas never provided this information and Defendants have never taken steps to compel its \nproduction.  The data produced by the other two Counties is not used to analyze or evaluate \nindigent defense services or to ensure their adequacy. \n97.  Pursuant to Article VI of the Michigan State Constitution, the SCAO is authorized \nto issue best practices guidelines for courts within its jurisdiction.  The SCAO has issued \nguidelines on such topics as jail overcrowding and conservatorship, but never on the provision of \ncompetent criminal defense services to indigent defendants.  Defendants have taken no steps to \nrequire the SCAO to issue best practices guidelines concerning indigent defense services. \n98.  In contrast, Michigan engages in administrative oversight of prosecuting \nattorneys.  MCL 14.30 directs the Attorney General to “supervise the work of, consult and advise \nthe prosecuting attorneys, in all matters pertaining to the duties of their offices” and to make \nbiennial reports to the Legislature.  Prosecuting Attorneys in the three Counties must also submit \nannual reports to the Attorney General.  MCL 14.32.  The state-created and funded Prosecuting \nAttorneys Coordinating Council provides state-wide direction as to the “system of conduct” to be \n  28 \n \n \n\n \nfollowed by all prosecuting attorneys.  1972 PA 203; MCL 49.109.  On information and belief, \nthese statutory provisions are followed. \n \nV.  Because of Defendants’ Failures To Fund and To Exercise Oversight, the Counties \nDeny Indigent Defense Counsel Fiscal and Administrative Support Necessary To \nProvide Constitutionally Adequate Legal Representation. \n99.  As a direct result of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense providers \nhave the tools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense in the three \nCounties, indigent defense services in the Counties, and elsewhere in the State, are operated at \nthe lowest cost possible and without regard to the constitutional adequacy of the services \nprovided.  The result is that the indigent defense provided in each of the three Counties does not \nmeet—and does not attempt to meet—the ABA’s Ten Principles, Michigan’s Eleven Principles, \nor commensurate safeguards; and does not meet or even attempt to meet the constitutional \nminimums required by the United States and Michigan Constitutions. \n100.  Berrien and Muskegon Counties, as is the case with approximately 39 other \nMichigan counties, enter into contracts with a law firm or group of lawyers pursuant to which the \ncounty pays the attorneys a flat fee or flat rate to staff all trial-level felony indigent defense cases \nfor a set period of time.  Berrien County has entered into contracts with roughly 12 local \nattorneys to provide defender services to indigent adults in criminal courts located in the cities of \nSt. Joseph and Niles, and in the drug court in St. Joseph.  The contracts provide the attorneys \nwith a fixed amount per year to cover all cases arising during the contract period.  Because the \nfixed amount is intended to cover training, legal research tools, and investigative work, there is a \nfinancial disincentive for indigent defense counsel to allocate funds to these necessary items.  \nAttorneys must also pay for conflict counsel from the flat rate, providing a financial disincentive \nfor identifying conflicts.  \n  29 \n \n \n\n \n101.  Muskegon County contracts with a single law firm to handle all adult felony cases \nat the trial level.  That firm, in turn, sub-contracts with other attorneys with no supervision by or \ninvolvement from the County.  As in Berrien County, the contract provides the law firm with a \nfixed amount to cover all cases arising during the contract period.  Also as in Berrien County, the \ncontract provides no additional funds for training, legal research tools, experts, investigators, or \noffice overhead, and therefore provides the same disincentives to the provision of \nconstitutionally adequate indigent defense as exist in Berrien County. \n102.  Genesee County and approximately 36 other Michigan counties, use assigned \ncounsel systems, in which a court administrator or judges appoints individual lawyers to \nrepresent indigent clients on a case-by-case basis.  Genesee County uses an “attorney for the \nday” program, in which one or two attorneys handle all cases on a given day and are \ncompensated based on an event-based fee schedule.  As of July 2006, there were approximately \n100 attorneys accepting appointments.  The assigned counsel program is administered by a single \nDefender Administrator, who also serves as Circuit Court Administrator.  The Defender \nAdministrator is supposed to oversee the assigned counsel list and is responsible for processing \nattorney vouchers and reviewing all eligibility determinations.  The event-based fee schedule and \nmethod of attorney reimbursement used in Genesee County undercompensates attorneys for their \nwork and provides financial disincentives to the provision of constitutionally adequate indigent \ndefense.  \n103.  As described in greater detail below, as a result of Defendants’ failure to provide \nfunding and to exercise fiscal and administrative oversight, the provision of indigent defense \nservices at the trial court level in the three Counties is inadequately funded, fails to provide \ncounsel to all eligible indigent defendants, fails to ensure that defense counsel are qualified, fails \n  30 \n \n \n\n \nto protect the independence of the defense function, fails to train attorneys adequately, fails to \nmonitor attorney workloads, fails to monitor and supervise attorney performance, and fails to \nidentify and handle conflicts of interest properly. \nA.  Indigent Defense Services in the Counties Are Inadequately Funded. \n104.  Because of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense providers have the \ntools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense, defense services in each of \nthe three Counties are not adequately financed.  Contrary to the ABA Ten Principles and \nMichigan’s Eleven Principles, indigent defense efforts in the Counties are not equal partners in \nthe criminal justice system. \n105.  In Berrien and Genesee Counties, the budget of the prosecuting attorney’s office \nis nearly three and a half times greater than each County’s indigent defense budget.  In \nMuskegon County, the prosecuting attorney’s budget is nearly double the County’s indigent \ndefense budget.  \n106.  In 1999, a survey by the U.S. Department of Justice of 100 largest counties in the \ncountry found that $1.205 billion was spent on defending some 4.2 million criminal cases; or \nsome $287 per case.  See http://www.ojp.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/idslc99.txt.  Recently, the Muskegon \nCounty finance director issued a letter to the county commissioners stating that the average cost \nper case should be kept to $130 to $140.  In 2004, some Berrien County contract holders \nreceived an average of $94 per case. \n107.  Although assigned counsel in Genesee County appear to receive more money per \ncase than indigent defense counsel in Berrien and Muskegon, they do so pursuant to a fee \nschedule that provides incentives to attorneys to encourage indigent defendants to plead guilty \nearly and to high charges.  The fee schedule also bears no relation to the amount of time \nattorneys actually spend working on assigned cases.  It provides a flat base fee for each assigned \n  31 \n \n \n\n \nfelony case and “extra” fees for additional specific services.  For example, attorneys receiving \nfive felony cases on the day they are scheduled for assignments receive a base rate of $400 for all \nfive cases, while attorneys receiving two felony cases are paid $175 total.  Attorneys can receive \nan additional $200 for pre-trial preparation of non-capital felonies; $400 for pre-trial preparation \nof capital felonies; $30 for visiting a client in jail prior to the preliminary examination (additional \nvisits prior to disposition are not compensated); $200 if the client pleads guilty in Circuit Court \nbefore the first day of trial; and only $50 if the client pleads guilty on the day of trial.  Although \nthe fee schedule provides that attorneys can petition for extraordinary expenses, few do, and \nthose who do typically receive only a fraction of what they request. \n108.  Because of Defendants’ failings, as set forth above, the Counties take \nextraordinary measures that defy constitutional requirements in order to keep costs low.  For \nexample, they limit access to experts and investigators.  In all three Counties, indigent defense \ncounsel must petition judges and/or trial court administrators for permission to retain experts and \ninvestigators.  Most requests are either denied or not granted in full.  As a result, many indigent \ndefense counsel simply do not bother to make such motions.  In 2004, the trial court \nadministrator in Berrien County did not receive a single request for an expert or an investigator. \nB.  Indigent Defense Services in the Counties Fail To Provide Counsel To All \nEligible Indigent Defendants. \n109.  Because of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense providers have the \ntools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense, none of the Counties has \nwritten guidelines defining which defendants qualify for indigent defense counsel.  In most \ncases, the judges make the decision, but not all judges consider the same factors.  As a result, \neligibility requirements vary widely from county to county and from case to case, and indigent \ndefendants who are constitutionally eligible for state-appointed counsel are denied counsel.   \n  32 \n \n \n\n \n110.  One Berrien County judge, for example, routinely refuses to appoint counsel to \ndefendants who have made bail, while other Berrien County judges do not view having made \nbail as determinative. \n111.  Indigent defense counsel in Muskegon and Genesee Counties frequently second-\nguess judicial eligibility determinations, and resist being appointed to represent individuals they \nview as ineligible.  The Muskegon law firm holding the indigent defense contract advises its \nlawyers to move to be discharged from representing clients who have full-time jobs, regardless \nof how little those jobs pay. \n112.  One attorney in Genesee County refuses to represent indigent defendants assigned \nto him if he considers them to be financially ineligible.  Instead, he offers to represent them as a \nprivate attorney, at a discount from his normal rate.  \nC.  Indigent Defense Services in the Counties Fail To Ensure That Indigent \nDefense Counsel Are Qualified. \n113.  Because of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense providers have the \ntools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense, none of the Counties takes \nsteps to ensure that only qualified counsel represent indigent persons charged with criminal \noffenses.  Neither the Berrien nor Muskegon County programs have written job descriptions or \nqualifications.  Although the administrative order promulgated by Muskegon County pursuant to \nMCR 8.123 requires attorneys to “have the requisite skill and experience to provide \nconstitutionally satisfactory representation,” it does not define “requisite skill or experience.”  In \npractice, indigent defense counsel need no more than bar admission and residence in the County \nto be appointed. \n114.  The Genesee County Defender Administrator never has rejected an application to \njoin the assignment list for anything other than failure to pass the bar examination or lack of \n  33 \n \n \n\n \nresidency.  In fact, when the Administrator adds attorneys to the list, she prefers recent law \nschool graduates.  She has stated that she is suspicious of more experienced attorneys who wish \nto join, because the rate of compensation is so low. \n115.  Neither Berrien nor Muskegon Counties have written guidelines establishing the \ndegree of experience an attorney must have to handle complex felonies or capital cases.  \nAttorneys right out of law school with no background in criminal practice are permitted to \nhandle serious felony cases.  In Berrien County, at least one contractor routinely subcontracts his \nwork to younger and inexperienced associates with no training.  Attorneys are rehired year after \nyear despite the fact that they lack the skills and knowledge necessary to provide constitutionally \nadequate services.  \n116.  Genesee County maintains “A” and “B” lists of attorneys, with A-list attorneys \nsupposedly having the experience necessary to handle more complex cases than B-list attorneys.  \nHowever, there are no guidelines as to what type of experience is needed to get on the “A list.” \n117.  In contrast, the Berrien and Genesee County prosecutor’s offices have written job \ndescriptions that list minimum job qualifications and years of experience; required knowledge, \nskill and abilities; and tasks to be performed by prosecuting attorneys. \nD.  Indigent Defense Services in the Counties Fail To Protect the Independence \nof the Defense Function. \n118.  Because of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense providers have the \ntools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense, none of the Counties’ \nprograms ensures the independence of the defense function.  Although contracting and hiring \ndecisions are supposed to be made by County Commissioners or, in the case of Genesee County, \nthe Defender Administrator, judges routinely involve themselves in the solicitation of contract \nbids and the selection and retention of indigent defense counsel. \n  34 \n \n \n\n \n119.  For example, approximately 10 years ago the Chief Judge of Berrien County \nattempted to lower the indigent defense counsel contract rates and to eliminate some specific \npeople from the group then holding the contract by encouraging junior attorneys to bid for the \ncontracts.  The lower bids from more junior attorneys reduced the bids from the more \nexperienced attorneys, some of whom ultimately kept the contracts, but for much less money. \nE.  Indigent Defense Services in the Counties Fail To Train Indigent Defense \nCounsel Adequately. \n120.  Because of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense providers have the \ntools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense, indigent defendants in the \nCounties are represented by counsel who have not received adequate training.  The Berrien and \nMuskegon County programs provide no continuing legal education and training requirements, \nand the Genesee County program does not provide continuing legal education and training \nadequate to ensure that new attorneys learn how to perform their jobs competently and that more \nexperienced attorneys keep their skills up to date.  Michigan does not have a continuing legal \neducation requirement. \n121.  As a result, many indigent defense counsel are unable adequately to advise their \nclients because they are unaware of key aspects of criminal law and procedure, such as the notice \nrequirement for the use of an alibi defense or appropriate objections. \n122.  By comparison, the prosecutor’s office in Berrien County sets aside funds for \nregular training, the prosecutor’s office in Muskegon County holds week-long training sessions, \nand prosecutors in Genesee County attend quarterly state training conferences and receive on-\nthe-job training. \n  35 \n \n \n\n \nF.  Indigent Defense Services in the Counties Fail To Monitor Attorney \nWorkloads. \n123.  Because of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense providers have the \ntools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense, the Counties’ indigent \ndefense programs do not have workload limits, do not monitor workloads, and tolerate excessive \nworkloads.  The National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, \nestablished to advise the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, states that a single \nfull-time indigent defense counsel can reasonably be expected to handle no more than: (a) 150 \nfelonies per year; or (b) 400 misdemeanors per year; or (c) 200 juvenile delinquency cases per \nyear.  The ABA Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility recently issued a \nformal opinion describing the ethical obligation of indigent defense counsel to refuse \nappointments and/or withdraw from representation when excessive caseloads interfere with \ncompetent and diligent representation.  ABA Formal Opinion 06-441.  \n124.  Many indigent defense counsel in the Counties have excessive caseloads.  For \nexample, in Berrien County, 6 of the 12 contract holders in 2004 received a collective total of \n4,479 felony and misdemeanor cases, for an average of over 746 cases per attorney.  One \nattorney doing contract work regularly had a caseload of 1,000 cases a year (700 misdemeanors \nand 300 felonies) in addition to 200 private cases.  One attorney in Muskegon County  handled \nover 700 felony cases per year; another routinely handled 15 felonies per week. \nG.  Indigent Defense Services in the Counties Fail to Provide Meaningful \nMonitoring and Supervision of Attorney Performance. \n125.  Because of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense providers have the \ntools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense, there are no written \nperformance standards and no formal system of monitoring and supervision to guide indigent \ndefense counsel in their representation of indigent defendants in the three Counties.  Neither the \n  36 \n \n \n\n \ncontracts in Berrien and Muskegon nor the Administrative Order promulgated by Genesee \nCounty pursuant to MCR 8.123 contains performance standards.  There is no structured or \nmeaningful feedback on attorney representation.  In contrast, prosecutors in Berrien and \nGenesee, for example, are regularly evaluated on their work. \nH.  Indigent Defense Services in the Counties Fail To Identify and Handle \nConflicts Properly. \n126.  Because of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense providers have the \ntools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense, the Counties’ programs do \nnot have written standards that define conflicts of interest.  As a result, attorneys routinely \nrepresent clients in situations in which conflicts of interest exist.  \n127.  Many indigent defense counsel also serve as prosecutors, often in the same \ncourtrooms before the same judges.  Some are assigned to defend individuals they previously \nprosecuted. \n128.  For example, a Berrien County attorney does both felony defense work and abuse \nand neglect work.  He has no system for screening conflicts despite the possibility of defending a \nparent under the felony contract who is also the subject of an abuse and neglect proceeding under \nthe other contract. \n129.  To the extent conflicts are identified, they are identified late in the judicial \nprocess, depriving indigent defendants of their constitutional right to conflict-free representation. \n \nVI.  Defendants’ Failures To Fund and To Exercise Necessary Oversight Prevent \nIndigent Defense Counsel from Putting the Prosecution’s Case To the Crucible of \nMeaningful Adversarial Testing. \n130.  Plaintiffs are entitled to constitutionally adequate legal representation, that is, \nrepresentation that puts the prosecution’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  \n  37 \n \n \n\n \nBy failing to provide sufficient funding and fiscal and administrative oversight, Defendants have \nfailed to ensure that indigent defense counsel possess the tools necessary to provide \nconstitutionally adequate legal representation, and have thus deprived Plaintiff Class members of \ntheir constitutional rights.  To the extent that the ABA and NLADA performance standards set \nforth tasks that defense counsel should undertake to provide such representation, indigent \ndefense counsel in the Counties are prevented from performing them.  As a result, the Plaintiff \nClass is constructively denied, or threatened with the constructive denial of counsel.  Following \nare some examples of the deficiencies in representation caused by Defendants’ abdication of \nMichigan’s obligation to provide indigent defendants with constitutionally adequate legal \ndefense: \n131.  Indigent defense counsel do not confer with their clients prior to critical stages in \ntheir criminal proceedings.  Pursuant to Michigan state law, all persons accused of criminal \nwrongdoing must be arraigned before a magistrate within 72 hours of their arrest.  At \narraignment, the magistrate informs the individual of the charges against him or her and appoints \ncounsel if the person is indigent.  Within 14 days of arraignment, the defendant is entitled to a \nprobable cause hearing (also known as a preliminary examination) at which a magistrate or judge \ndecides whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the case. \n132.  Most indigent defense counsel do not speak with their clients before they arrive at \nthe courthouse for the probable cause hearing.  Attorneys in the Counties routinely enter into \nplea negotiations without clients’ permission and before initial client interviews.  One Genesee \nCounty attorney has stated that he only meets with incarcerated clients prior to a preliminary \nexamination if they are charged with felonies punishable by more than five to ten years of \nimprisonment. \n  38 \n \n \n\n \n133.  When the initial interviews finally take place, these privileged and confidential \ndiscussions between the attorney and client are often held in public, damaging the attorney client \nrelationship, preventing open and candid discussion, and making it possible for parties with \nadverse interests (such as victims, prosecutors and co-defendants) to overhear conversations.  \nAlthough courthouses are equipped with private rooms, few defenders use them.  In Genesee \nCounty, interviews often take place via a video link to the jail that is neither secure nor \nconfidential, and is often unavailable because it is in use by judges conducting video \narraignments or by other attorneys. \n134.  Defendants do not ensure, or even encourage, communications between Plaintiffs \nand their defense counsel.  All three Counties have collect-call-only policies in the county \ndetention facilities.  Because the Counties do not reimburse indigent defense counsel for these \ncalls, the attorneys have a strong financial disincentive to accept them.  At least one attorney in \nBerrien County actually asked a client to stop attempting to communicate with him. \n135.  Indigent defense counsel are unable adequately to investigate the charges against \ntheir clients or to hire investigators who can assist with case preparation and testify at trial.  \nMany Plaintiffs are represented at each new court hearing by a different attorney, none of whom \nhas had the time to become familiar with their cases, to review any prior work carried out by any \nof the previous attorneys, or to discuss their defense to the charges.  The attorneys generally do \nnot meet with or subpoena witnesses, follow up on potential alibis, visit the scenes of the crimes, \nexamine evidence, or use independent investigative resources.  To the extent clients provide lists \nof witnesses and avenues of investigation, counsel rarely pursue them. \n  39 \n \n \n\n \n136.  The ability of clients to participate in the development of their defense to the \ncharges is further hampered by the fact that some attorneys refuse to provide their clients with \ncopies of court files and police records. \n137.  Counsel are unable to file necessary motions for pre-trial suppression, discovery, \nspeedy trial, motions to quash circuit court bind-over, or motions in limine.  They often fail to \nchallenge illegal identifications, illegal searches and seizures, or illegally obtained confessions. \n138.  Counsel cannot prepare adequately for court hearings and trial.  Many do not call \nwitnesses to testify on their clients’ behalf, do not call experts to challenge the prosecution, and \ndo not perform meaningful cross-examinations.  Others do not make opening or closing \nstatements at trial.  In fact, many do not put on any meaningful defense case at all. \n139.  Counsel also often fail to provide meaningful representation at sentencings.  Some \nattorneys offer information during sentencing proceedings that is detrimental to their clients’ \ncases.  Others often fail to catch sentencing errors and do not read the pre-sentencing reports \nprior to the sentencing hearings. \n140.  Attorneys in Berrien County frequently sit at counsel’s table before a court \nproceeding is over, leaving Plaintiffs to be sentenced without any counsel standing by their side, \nmuch less advocating on their behalf.  Other attorneys actively engage in discussions with other \nclients or with the prosecutor while their clients are speaking to the judge.  Those attorneys who \nremain standing do not introduce information outside of the pre-sentence report. \n \n \n \n \n  40 \n \n \n\n \nVII.  As a Result Of the Failures and Deficiencies Described Herein, Members of the \nPlaintiff Class Are Harmed. \n141.  Plaintiffs suffer irreparable harm or are at imminent and serious risk of suffering \nsuch harm because of Defendants’ failure to adequately fund and oversee the Michigan’s \nindigent defense system. \n142.  Some members of the Plaintiff Class must represent themselves because they are \nwrongfully denied defender services. \n143.  Other Class members are detained unnecessarily or for prolonged periods of time \nbefore trial.  Contract defenders in Berrien and Muskegon Counties, for example, rarely seek \nreductions in bail, even for clients whose charges have been reduced by the prosecutor, or for \nclients who pose no flight risk.  Many indigent defense counsel fail to appear at court \nproceedings, resulting in frequent rescheduling and postponements.  One client in Muskegon \nCounty, for example, was forced to sit in the county jail for months because an attorney he never \nmet missed several consecutive court dates, including three scheduled circuit court hearings. \n144.  Many Class members are compelled to take inappropriate pleas, often to the \nhighest charge, even when they have meritorious defenses.  Indigent defense counsel routinely \nencourage their clients to plead guilty without a proper factual basis for guilt, without even a \ncursory investigation into potentially meritorious defenses, in the absence of any physical \nevidence, and without the presence of a complaining witness.  On advice of counsel, some \nPlaintiffs take “open” pleas, i.e., pleas that are taken without promise of a particular sentence, \nthat often result in punishment that is disproportionate to the facts of the case. \n145.  An attorney in Berrien County advised a client who claimed to have acted in self-\ndefense to plead guilty to a domestic violence charge.  An attorney in Genesee County permitted \na client to plead guilty to failure to pay restitution to his ex-wife even though he had already paid \n  41 \n \n \n\n \nher the money owed.  Other attorneys in Berrien County routinely fail to ensure that non-\nEnglish-speaking clients understand what rights they waive by pleading guilty. \n146.  Fearful that their attorneys will not adequately prepare for trial, Plaintiffs forgo \ntheir right to trial, pleading guilty to crimes they did not commit or to charges more severe than \nthe facts of their cases warrant.   \n147.  Those who insist on their right to trial may be subjected to punitive charges or \nlengthy pre-trial delays.  For example, an individual defendant in Muskegon County sat in jail \nfor ten months awaiting trial before he finally pled no contest to, among other charges, attempted \nlarceny.  His indigent defense counsel refused to enforce his right to a speedy trial and instead \ntold the client that if he did not plead, the prosecutor would drop the charges against him before \nthe speedy trial time period ran and re-arraign him on the same charges.  There was no evidence \nconnecting the client to the crime and the client had three alibi witnesses who would have \ntestified that he was nowhere near the crime scene. \n148.  Many Class members who plead guilty or are found guilty at trial face harsher \nsentences than the facts of their cases warrant.  A client in Berrien County received a sentence of \n12 to 24 months even though the plea agreement had recommended no incarceration.  When the \nsentence was imposed, her attorney said nothing.  Instead, it was the prosecutor who reminded \nthe court of its obligation to allow the client to withdraw her plea if the court did not intend to \nfollow the plea agreement. \n149.  An attorney in Genesee County told a client trying to decide whether to plead \nguilty to tampering with a parking meter that if he were convicted at trial, he would face a \nsentence of 15 years.  According to Michigan’s sentencing guidelines, however, the sentencing \nrange for the crime with which the client was charged was 0 to 34 months. \n  42 \n \n \n\n \n150.  A client in Berrien County was sentenced to 37 days for contempt even though \nthe maximum sentence permitted under state law was 30 days.  Again, when the sentence was \nimposed, defense counsel said nothing.  The court clerk noticed the error.  \n151.  Plaintiffs—including those who receive public assistance—are assessed fees in \nthe hundreds of dollars that they cannot possibly pay without substantial hardship, including \ncharges for attorneys who have provided little advocacy.  Attorneys in Berrien and Muskegon \nCounties, for example, do not advocate for Plaintiffs at proceedings to assess fees and attorney \ncharges despite clear Supreme Court case law condemning automatic fee assessments and \nprohibiting the assessment of counsel costs that do not involve a determination of the client’s \nability to pay.  Clients in Berrien County are not advised of the costs they will be charged, such \nas for probationary supervision, before they plead guilty.  Clients in Muskegon County are \nroutinely assessed fees of $120 without regard for their ability to pay. \n152.  Plaintiffs do not have access to alternatives to incarceration.  Plaintiffs who \nshould be enrolled in drug treatment programs, for example, are instead sentenced to lengthy \nprison terms that cannot address underlying issues.  Medical records that can indicate effective \nsolutions are rarely, if ever, requested.  Clients who wish to have alternative sentencing must \nexplore the alternatives and request them themselves. \n153.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n \n  43 \n \n \n\n \nCOUNT I \nSIXTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION  \nAND 42 USC §1983 \n \n(Against Defendant Granholm) \n(Asserted by All Named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class) \n154.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth herein the \nallegations of paragraphs 1 through 153. \n155.  Michigan is obligated to provide tools to indigent defense counsel that will enable \ncounsel to provide constitutionally adequate defense services to Plaintiff Class members. \n156.  As set forth herein, Defendant Granholm fails to provide funding and oversight to \nthe County programs, and therefore does nothing to ensure that the State provides the necessary \ntools to indigent defense counsel in the Counties. \n157.  As a result of Defendant’s failures to provide funding and exercise guidance, \nMichigan’s indigent defense system is under funded, poorly administered, and does not provide \nmandated constitutional protections. \n158.  As a result of Michigan’s deficient indigent defense system, indigent defense \ncounsel in the Counties are unable to provide constitutionally adequate legal representation. \n159.  As a result of the inability of indigent defense counsel to provide constitutionally \nadequate legal representation, Plaintiffs are harmed. \n160.  Defendant’s failure to provide the funding and to exercise the oversight necessary \nfor constitutionally adequate indigent defense during trial court felony criminal proceedings \nviolates Plaintiffs’ rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nincluding, but not limited to, their right to effective assistance of counsel.

Recently, an American Bar Association (ABA) report on the state of public \ndefense across the country repeatedly cited Michigan for failing to meet the ABA Ten \nPrinciples, which are considered the fundamental criteria a system must meet to provide \n \neffective public defense. \"Government officials have long been on notice of these \nproblems,\" added Steinberg. \"Despite the deepening crisis, the state has refused to take \naction.\"\n \n \nThe result is unfair, not just for defendants, but for all Michigan residents, said the \ncoalition. \"The broken public defense system puts all of Michigan's citizens at risk,\" said \n \nMalia Brink, Indigent Defense Counsel for the National Association of Criminal Defense \n  Lawyers. \"When the defense cannot function, fair trials are impossible; innocent people \ngo to jail and guilty people remain free to commit other crimes.\"\nThe broken system is also costly.

The counties \nhave been dramatically underfunding public defense for years, without any state \nintervention. In Berrien County, the prosecution receives almost four times more funding \nthan the public defense system.\nBecause of these and other inequities, public defenders are crippled by overwhelming \ncaseloads that impede them from meeting with their clients, investigating cases, filing \nappropriate pre-trial motions, and preparing properly for court appearances, said the \ncoalition.\n\"Quite simply, the public defense available in these counties does not meet the minimal \nconstitutional requirements, no less national standards,\" said Julie North, an attorney with \nCravath, Swaine & Moore. \"The system is so broken that attorneys operating within it \ncannot adequately defend their clients.\"\nThe lawsuit was filed in Ingham County Circuit Court and calls on the court to compel the \nstate to provide representation consistent with national standards and constitutional \nnorms. The lawsuit does not seek monetary damages.\nThe plaintiffs in the case are individuals facing felony charges in Berrien, Muskegon and \nGenesee Counties who cannot afford private counsel. They represent all defendants in \nthe counties who are charged or will be charged with felony crimes and who cannot afford \nprivate counsel.\nThe Michigan Coalition for Justice is a diverse group of organizations and individuals \ncommitted to reform of Michigan's public defense system.

      "text": " \nMichigan Supreme Court to Hear Case on Public Defense System \nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: \nDecember 21, 2009 \n \nLANSING – In an order entered Friday, the Michigan Supreme Court agreed to hear the state’s \nappeal in a class action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union seeking to fix \nMichigan’s system for providing lawyers to poor people in criminal cases. In June 2009, a \nMichigan Court of Appeals rejected the state’s attempts to dismiss the lawsuit and allowed the \nlawsuit to proceed. \n \n“In a state where we spend more on prisons than on education, it is imperative that this broken \nsystem be fixed and that all those accused of a crime receive the same quality of justice no matter \nhow rich or poor,” said Kary L. Moss, ACLU of Michigan Executive Director. “We look \nforward to the opportunity to explain to the Michigan Supreme Court the need for our case to \nproceed so that justice is not delayed for poor people in the state.” \n \nEarlier this year, the state asked the Court of Appeals to dismiss the case for technical reasons, \narguing that the state was immune, that a class action is inappropriate and that the plaintiffs \ncould not sue until after they are convicted. The Court of Appeals rejected the state’s arguments \nrecognizing the plaintiffs must be given the opportunity to prove that the state has violated the \nConstitution.  \n \n“We cannot accept the proposition that the constitutional rights of our citizens, even those \naccused of crimes and too poor to afford counsel, are not deserving and worthy of any protection \nby the judiciary in a situation where the executive and legislative branches fail to comply with \nconstitutional mandates and abdicate their constitutional responsibilities,” wrote Michigan \nAppeals Court Judge William Murphy. \n \nIn February 2007, the ACLU filed a class action against the state on behalf of all indigent \ncriminal defendants in Berrien, Muskegon and Genesee Counties. The lawsuit was filed in \nIngham County Circuit Court and called on the court to declare the current public defense \nsystems of the three counties unconstitutional and compel the state to assure representation \nconsistent with national standards and constitutional norms.  \n \nIn May 2007, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Laura Baird rejected the state’s calls to \ndismiss the lawsuit, but the state appealed.  \n \nCurrently, Michigan provides no administrative oversight or funding for public defense at the \ntrial level, but delegates all responsibility to the counties. There is no state training for public \ndefense attorneys, no performance standards to govern their practice, and no review of their \n\nperformance. Moreover, many of the counties have been dramatically under-funding indigent \ndefense for years. The result is that in each of the three counties at issue in the suit - and indeed \nin many parts of Michigan - the public defense provided does not meet national standards or the \nconstitutional minimum requirements for effective assistance of counsel.  \n \nIn addition, many experts believe the state’s broken system is costly. Michigan spends almost $2 \nbillion dollars a year on prisons. Experts estimate that this amount is 40 percent higher than other \nstates due to unwarranted, inappropriately long sentences. In addition, the broken system leads to \nthe incarceration of innocent people. For instance, the case of Eddie Joe Lloyd, a man who \nserved 17 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, cost the state $4 million to settle a \nlawsuit upon his release. This figure doesn’t include the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent \nto incarcerate him or the amount the state spent prosecuting the case and defending the appeal. \n \nAttorneys for the class of indigent defendants include Moss, Mark Granzotto, Michael J. \nSteinberg, Mark Fancher and Jessie Rossman of the ACLU of Michigan, Frank Eaman of \nDetroit, Robin Dahlberg of the National ACLU, and Julie North, Misty Archambault and Sarita \nPrabhu of New York law firm of Cravath Moore & Swain. \n \nTo read the Michigan Supreme Court’s order granting the state’s application for leave to appeal, \ngo to: http://coa.courts.mi.gov/documents/SCT/PUBLIC/ORDERS/20091218_S139345_83... \n \nTo read the opinion, go to: \nhttp://coa.courts.mi.gov/documents/opinions/final/coa/20090611_c278652_7... \n \nTo read the ACLU brief on appeal, click here. \n \nTo read the complaint, click here.  \n ",

DID  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  PROPERLY  EXERCISE  ITS \nDISCRETION IN CONCLUDING THAT THIS CASE MET ALL OF \nTHE REQUIREMENTS FOR A CLASS ACTION AS SET OUT IN \nMCR 3.501(A)(l)? \nPlaintiffs-Appellants say \"Yes\". \nDefendants-Appellants say \"No\". \nx \n\nCOUNTERSTAIEMENT OF MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS AND FACTS \nIn 1963, the Supreme Courtofthe United States recognized in Gideon v Wainwright, 372 \nUS 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed2d 799 (1963), that \"in our adversary system of criminal justice, any \nperson hailed into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless \ncounsel is provided for him.\"  Id. at 344.  The Court in Gideon further  held that the right to \ncounsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution represented a right \nso \"fundamental and essential\" to a fair trial that it was imposed on the states under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  !d. at 342. \nThree months after the Gideon case was decided, the citizens of Michigan voted to \napprove a new constitution. That constitution contains a provision guaranteeing that \"[i]n every \ncriminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his \nor her defense.\"  Const 1963, art I, §20.  Article  J, § 17 of the Michigan Constitution further \nprovides that no person shall be denied life, liberty or property without due process of law. \nThis suit for declaratory and injunctive reliefwas instituted against the State of Michigan \nand Governor Jennifer M.  Granholm  because the State of Michigan has  failed to meet its \nobligations under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and \narticle I, §20 and article I, § 17 of the Michigan Constitution. This case was filed in the Ingham \nCounty Circuit Cow1 on February 22, 2007, on behalf of eight plaintiffs who were charged with \nfelonies in Berrien, Genesee or Muskegon County and who required a public defender. The case \nwas also brought on behalf of a class of all adults who have been or will be charged with felonies \nin these three counties, and who require a public defense.  Complaint (App. pp. 1b  · 49b). \nPlaintiffs  allege  in  their complaint that,  because of the  acts and  omissions of the \n\ndefendants, the indigent defense system in  place in the three counties does not comply with \nconstitutional mandates.  The complaint alleges that assigned defense counsel in these counties \ndo not have the  resources necessary to  provide their clients with constitutionally adequate \nrepresentation, because they lack manageable caseloads, necessary support, as well as appropriate \ntraining, supervision and monitoring.  Complaint, '~98-1 08, 120-125 (App. pp. 29b -32b; 35b-\n37b). Assigned counsel have too many cases, with felony caseloads in one county averaging 746 \na year.  [d. • ~1r123-124 (App. p. 36b). They have either no resources or insufficient resources to \nhire outside investigators or experts. Jd.,  88-92 (App. pp. 25b -27b).  And they often lack the \nskills, experience and training to handle the cases assigned to them. Jd.,  ~1 13-117 (App. pp. 33b \n-34b).  As a consequence, plaintiffs allege that the assigned counsel system in the three counties \nfails to meet the constitutional requirement because counsel cannot put the prosecution's case to \n«the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\"  United States v Cronic, 466 US 648, 656; 104 \nS Ct 2039; 80 L Ed 2d 657 (1984).  Plaintiffs further allege that counsel assigned to represent \ndefendants in felony cases in the three counties do not provide representation at critical stages in \nthe criminal proceeding, particularly: they do not meet with clients prior to critical stages in their \ncriminal proceedings; they do not adequately investigate the charges against their clients; they do \nnot file necessary pre-trial motions, prepare properly for court appearances or provide meaningful \nrepresentation at sentencings; they do not employ and consult with experts when necessary; and \nthey do not ensure that they are representing clients free from conflicts of interest.  Complaint, \n8, 126-129, 131-140 (App. pp. 4b; 37b - 40b). \nAs a direct result of defendants' failure to ensure that indigent defense providers have the \ntools  necessary  to  provide  constitutionally  adequate  counsel,  plaintiffs  allege  that  their \n2 \n\nconstitutional rights are violated continuously.  Because of these violations, plaintiffs have \nsuffered, will continue to suffer, and are at imminent risk of suffering, an array of concrete, \nirreparable harms.  These harms include the wrongful denial of counsel at critical stages of their \ncases, wmecessarily prolonged detention before trial, the WTongful denial of the right to trial \ndespite meritorious defenses, and the imposition of sentences that are harsher than the facts of the \ncases warrant.  Complaint,  ' 141-153, (App. pp. 41b -43b). Plaintiffs also allege that they are \ncompelled to take guilty pleas even when there is no evidence to support the charges against them. \nComplaint, , 144 (App. p. 4Ib). \nThe complaint contains four counts.  Count l asserts a cause of action against Governor \nGranholm  under the federal civil  rights statute, 42  USC § 1983, based on the denial of the \nplaintiffs' rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  (App. p. 44b). \nCount II contains another claim against Governor Granholm under 42 USC § 1983 for violation \nof plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment rights.  (App. p. 4Sb). Counts III and TV allege causes of \naction  against  both  defendants  under article  I,  § 17  and  article  I,  §20  of the  Michigan \nConstitution. (App. pp. 46b - 47) \nPlaintiffs' complaint concludes with a description of the relief being sought in this case. \n(App. p. 48b).  Plaintiffs request a declaratory judgment, decreeing that the defendants have \nviolated  their  right  to counsel guaranteed  by  the  Sixth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution and article  I, §20 of the Michigan Constitution.  Id.  Plaintiffs further seek a \ndeclaratory judgment finding that the defendants have violated plaintiffs' rights under the due \nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and article I, § 17 of the Michigan Constitution. In \naddition to declaratory relief, the complaint further requests that the court \"permanently enjoin \n3 \n\nDefendants from subjecting Plaintiffs to practices that violate their rights.\" Jd. The complaint \nalso asks the court to \"[o]rder appropriate relief requiring Defendants to provide indigent defense \nprograms and representation consistent with the requirements of the United States and Michigan \nConstitutions.\"  Id. \nWith their complaint, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification under MCR 3.50 I. \nIn that motion, plaintiffs requested that the circuit court approve a class consisting of all adults \nin the three subject counties who have been or will be charged with felonies~ who must rely on \nthe state to provide counsel for their defense. \nIn lieu of filing an answer to the complaint, the defendants filed a motion for summary \ndisposition on April 5, 2007.  (App. pp. 50b -84b). In their motion, defendants raised a number \nof arguments.  They contended that plaintiffs' cause of action was subject to dismissal under \nMeR 2.116(C)(4) because the circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.  Defendants \nfurther argued that they were entitled to summary disposition under MCR 2.1l6(C)(7) based on \nprinciples of immunity.  Finally, defendants asserted that summary disposition was appropriate \nunder MeR 2.l l6(C)(8) because plaintiffs had failed to state a claim on which relief could be \ngranted.  The defendants' motion for summary disposition consisted entirely of argument based \non the allegations contained in plaintiffs' complaint.  Defendants did not attach to their motion \nany affidavits or documentation challenging the substance of the allegations contained in the \ncomplaint. \nDefendants filed their response to the class certification motion on May 10,2007. (App. \npp. 85b - II Ob).  In that response, defendants made only three arguments as to why certification \nof the proposed class was improper.  They contended that plaintiffs could not establish the \n4 \n\ncommonality or typicality requirements of MCR 3.501(A)(I)(b) and (c).  (App. pp. 87b -92b). \nDefendants further asserted that plaintiffs did not meet the requirements ofMCR 3.501 (A)(I )(e), \nthe subrule which requires that maintenance of a class action be superior to other methods of \nadjudication.  (App. 92b -94b). \nOn May 16,2007, the circuit court conducted a hearing on both defendants' motion for \nsummary disposition and plaintiffs' request for class certification.  (App. pp. 97a-112a). At that \nI \nhearing, the circuit court rejected each of the arguments presented in defendants' motion for \nsummary disposition. (App. pp. 10 6a-1 07a). The circuit court first concluded that plaintiffs had \nstanding to raise their constitutional claims and that these claims were ripe. (ld.). In reaching this \nconclusion, the circuit court rejected defendants' argument that plaintiffs had to be convicted first \nbefore they could establish standing.  fd. \nThe circuit court further rejected defendants' argument that courts were without authority \nto act because onJy the Michigan Legislature could appropriate funds from the state treasury. The \ncircuit court found defendants' arguments unpersuasive because, \"[t]he plaintiffs are not seeking \nmonetary relief from the state to fund an indigent defense program.  They are seeking injunctive \nand declaratory relief.  Therefore, that argument fails.\" (App. p. 107a). \nThe circuit court also concluded at the May 16,2007. hearing that plaintiffs were entitled \nto certification of the proposed class.  In reaching this conclusion, the circuit court first rejected \ndefendants' arguments that the commonality and typicality requirements of MeR 3.50 I (A)(I) \nwere not satisfied.  Focusing on the fact that plaintiffs sought only declaratory and injunctive \n'The transcript of this hearing indicates that it occurred on May 15,2007.  The transcript \nis incorrect; the hearing on the parties' motions took place on May 16,2007. \n5 \n\nrelief, the circuit court ruled that it would not \"have to explore the unique circumstances of each \nproposed class member to grant relief.\" (App. p. Ilia). Finally, the circuit court reviewed all of \nthe factors required under MCR 3.50 I (A)(2) and it determined that a class action would be \nsuperior to the methods of adjudicating these claims.  (ld). \nOn the same day that the hearing on the parties' motions, the circuit court. at the request \nof counsel  for defendants, signed  an order staying  further  proceedings  in  the  case  while \ndefendants pursued available appellate rights.  (App. pp. 3a -4a).  Written orders reflecting the \ncircuit court's rulings on the summary disposition and class certification motions were entered \non June 5, 2007.  (App. pp. Sa -8a). \nOn June 14,2007, defendants filed an appeal of right in the Court of Appeals from the \ncircuit court's denial of their request for summary disposition based on governmental immunity. \nDuncan v State 0/M  ichigan, Court of Appeals No. 278652.2 Defendants also filed applications \nfor leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals with respect to the non-immunity issues raised in their \nmotion for summary disposition, Duncan v State o/Michigan, Court of Appea1s No. 278858, and \nfrom the circuit court's order granting class certification. Duncan v State ofM  ichigan, Court of \nAppeals No. 278860. \nOn February 22, 2008, a two person majority of the Court of Appeals issued orders \ngranting defendants' two applications forleave to appeal. (App. pp. III b - 112b). Judge Donald \nS. Owens would have denied both applications.  The three appeals were consolidated by order of \n2The immunity issues raised in defendants' appeal of right were rejected by the Court of \nAppeals in its June 11,2009 opinion.  Duncan v Siale ojM  ichigan, 284 Mich App 246, 266-272; \n774 NW2d 89 (2009).  Defendants have not sought leave to appeal on any of these immunity \nissues, and these issues are not before this Court. \n6 \n\nthe Court of Appeals. \nOn June 11,2009, a panel of the Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the circuit \ncourt's decision denying the defendants' motion for summary disposition as well as its decision \ngranting class certification.  Duncan v Stale of Michigan, 284 Mich App 246; 774 NW2d 89 \n(2009).  Judge William C. Whitbeck dissented from the majority's conclusions. \nDefendants applied for leave to appeal on several of the issues addressed in the Court of \nAppeals June 11,2009 opinion. On December 18, 2009, this Court issued an order granting that \napplication. \n7 \n\nARGUMENT \nAs indicated in the Introduction to defendants' bricflO this Court, they raise three issues: \n(1)  whether the relief that might be awarded in this case violates art. 3, §2 of the Michigan \nConstitution, the separation of powers doctrine; (2) whether plaintiffs' claims are justiciable; and \n(3) whether the circuit court abused  its discretion in ceAifying this case as a class action. \nDefendants' Brief, pp. 2-3. \nI.  THE COURT MUST REJECT THE SEPARATION OF POWER \nCONCERNS RAISED BY DEFENDANTS. \nA.  lntroductioD \nIn Issue I of their brief, defendants focus on a possible remedy that might be imposed at \nthe conclusion of this case and they argue that plaintiffs' cause ofaelion should be dismissed \nbased on separation  of powers concerns.)  In light of the separation of powers issues that \nJThe separation of powers issues raised by defendants in this Court are largely based on \nthe contents of the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals written by Judge William C. \nWhitbeck. It is safe to say that Judge Whitbeck's view of the limited scope ofj udicial authority \nwithin our constitutional framework has not always been shared by the defendants in this case. \nIn moving for surmnary disposition, defendants did not contend that the correction of the \nconstitutional inadequacies in Michigan's assigned counsel system was solely the province of the \nexecutive and legislative branches.  To the contrary, defendants argued in their surnrnary \ndisposition rnotion that \"the changes sought in this lawsuit are best left to the judiciary, not \nindividual pre-conviction plaintiffs.\" (App. p. 64b) (emphasis added).  Thus, on the basis of this \nCourt's decision in 461h Circuit Trial Court v County o/Crawford, 476 Mich 131; 719 NW2d \n553 (2006), defendants argued in the circuit court that the judiciary has the right \"to ensure \nadequate funding if it finds that its constitutional responsibilities are not being carried out.  Such \nconstitutional responsibilities would include ensuring adequate legal services for indigent \ndefendants.\" (App. p. 64b).  Obviously, defendants' separation of powers concerns as expressed \nin their brief to this Court have evolved considerably over the course of this case. \nThe cornplete transformation of defendants' position on this issue is reOected on page 14 \nof their brief. There, defendants chide the Court of Appeals majority for the references in the \nrnajority opinion to 461h Circuit Trial Court.  Defendants' Brief, p. 14 (citing Duncan, 284 Mich \nApp at 283-284).  Defendants neglect to advise this Court that the views expressed in the \n8 \n\ndefendants so vigorously argue in this Court, there are two  important points that should be \nstressed at the outset. \nSomewhat lost in the overheated separation of powers arguments the defendants offer is \nthe fact that this is a suit alleging the violation of rights secured by both the United States and \nMichigan Constitutions.  Plaintiffs have alleged that the acts and omissions of defendants have \nresulted in the denial of the right to counsel guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions, and \nthat they have been denied due processoflaw under the Fourteenth Amendment and article I, § 17 \nof the  Michigan Constitution.  As  will  be discussed,  infra, the right to  review claims of \nunconstitutional conduct on the part of the other branches of Michigan government represents \"a \ncore judicial function.\" Lewis v State ofM  ichigan, 464 Mich 781,789; 629 NW2d 868 (2001). \nA second point of overwhelming importance in this appeal is the procedural posture of \nthis case.  Plainti_ffs filed this case on February 22, 2007.  Slightly over one month later, the \ndefendants filed a motion for summary disposition. In that motion, defendants did not challenge \nin any respect the substance of the allegations contained in the complaint. \nThe circuit court denied defendants' motion and also granted plaintiffs' request for class \ncertification. Over the pasltwo and a half years. the parties have been involved in the appeal of \nthe circuit court's interlocutory orders.  Under these circumstances, there are two incontestable \nprocedural facts that must guide the Court's review ofthe issues defendants have chosen to raise. \nFirst, the aJlegations contained in the complaint must be accepted as true.4  Thus. for purposes of \nmajority opinion, of which they are now SO highly critical, corresponded precisely to the position \nthat defendants took in the circuit court. \n'Defendants' arguments are premised on either MCR 2.116(C)(8) or MCR 2.116(C)(4). \nIn deciding a motion under MeR 2.116(C)(8), the Court's review is limited solely to the contents \n9 \n\nthe issues defendants argue in this appeal, the Court must accept as true plaintiffs' allegations that \nthe representation provided by assigned defense counsel to plaintiffs and the plaintiff class is not \nconstitutionally adequate. Similarly, the Court must accept as true the allegations in the complaint \nasserting that the defendants are responsible for the violations of plaintiffs' constitutional right \nto counsel and due process of law. \nThere is, however, another procedural aspect of this case that must be emphasized. This \ncase was pending in the circuit court for only a matter of months when defendants obtained a stay \nof further proceedings (App. p. 3a - 4a), and they appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals. \nDuring the limited period of time that this case was in the circuit court, none of the substantive \nissues raised in plaintiffs' complaint was Litigated.  Thus, plaintiffs were not called upon to \nmarshal the facts supportive of their constitutional claims or the defendants' involvement in the \ndenial of plaintiffs' constitutional rights.  More pertinent to the separation of powers argument \nthat defendants assert in this Court, in the short period of time that this case was pending in the \ncircuit court, that court obviously never had to address the question of the appropriate remedy to \nbe imposed if plaintiffs were to ultimately prevail on the merits of their constitutional claims. \nof the complaint; all of those allegations must be accepted as true and they must construed in the \nlight most favorable to plaintiffs. Maiden v Rozwood, 461 Mich 109, 119; 597 NW2d 817 \n(1999); Adair v State oj Michigan, 470 Mich 105, 119; 680 NW2d 386 (2004).  Similarly, if \ndefendants' arguments are construed as being based on MCR 2.1 16(C)(4) - lack of subject matter \njurisdiction -the Court must determine \"whether the pleadings demonstrate that the defendant \nwas entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Cork v Applebee's of Michigan, 239 Mich App \n311,315; 608 NW2d 62 (2000) (emphasis added); Steele v Department ojCorrections, 215 Mich \nApp 710, 712; 546 NW2d 725 (1996).  It is true that, when presented with a motion filed under \nMCR 2.1l6(C)(4), a court is required to examine material beyond the complaint, including \naffidavits, depositions, admissions and documentary evidence, when such material is submitted \nc.c. \nwith a motion filed under that rule.  Midwest, Inc. v McDougall, 470 Mich 878; 683 NW2d \n142 (2004).  But, as noted previously, the defendants herein supplied no such additional \ndocumentation with their April 2007 motion for summary disposition. \n10 \n\nin their arguments before this Court, defendants have placed an inordinate emphasis on \nthe character of the relief that the circuit court might some day award plaintiffs in the event they \nprove their right to counselor due process claims. But, as will be discussed, infra, this focus on \nthe relief that might be awarded should plaintiffs establish their claims at trial is clearly premature \nin a case in which no discovery has yet been taken, no proofs have yet been presented and no \nfinding of liability has yet been made. \nB.  MeL 775.16 \nThe defendants begin their argument by referring to MCL 775.16 and this state's long \ntradition of delegating to local authorities matters associated with the appointment of assigned \ncounsel.  MCL 775.16 simply provides that the appointment of counsel is to be made under the \ndirection of the chief judge of the circuit court and that an attorney appointed \"shall be entitled \nto receive from the county treasurer\" the amount which the chief judge considers reasonable.' \nThe precise point of this reference to MCL 775.16 and Michigan's \"tradition\" of local \ninvolvement in the assigned counsel process is difficuJt to understand in light of the fact that there \nis no debate in this case that the constitutional obligation imposed under Gideon is one that rests \nwilh Ihe slale.  Gideon, 372 US at 342-343; Poinler v Texas, 380 US 400, 401; 85 S Ct 1065; 13 \nLEd 2d 923 (1965) (\"[T]he Sixth Amendment's guarantee of right to counsel [is] obligatory upon \nthe States.\"); People v Williams, 470 Mich 634, 641; 683 NW2d 597 (2004) (recognizing that \n\"[t]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel is applicable to the states through the Due Process \n'While defendants cite MCL 775.16 and its provision for local payment of assigned \ncounsel, it is equally true (and equally unilluminating) that Michigan has a statutory provision \ncalling for state funding of some \"trial court operational expenses,\" which specifically includes \nthe cost of\"[a]ssigned counsel provided for indigents accused of criminal offenses or ordinance \nviolations ...\"   MCL 600.9947(2)(c). \nII \n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"); People v Parshay, 379 Mich 7,  II; 148 NW2d 869 \n(1967).  While the state may delegate the administration of Michigan's indigent defense system \nto local governments. that delegaiion does not excuse the stale of its constitutional obligations. \nCf West v Atkins, 487 US 42, 56; 108 S Ct 2250; 101  LEd 2d 40 (1998) (holding that a state's \ndecision to contract the provision of prison medical care to a private physician \"does nol relieve \nthe State of its constitutional duty to provide adequate medical treatment to those in its custody. \nand it does not deprive the State's prisoners of the means to vindicate their Eighth Amendment \nrights.\").  Thus, it is absolutely irrelevant that the state may have placed some aspects of the \nassigned counsel system in the hands oflocaJ authorities.6 \nc. \nThe \"Judicial Power\" To Adjudicate Constitutional Claims \nArticle 6, § I of the Michigan Constitution provides that U[t]he judicial power oftbe state \nis vested exclusively in one court ofj ustice.\" And, as this Court recently recognized, \"[s]ince the \ntime of Marbury v Madison, [5 US I Cranch 137; 2 LE 60 (1803)] interpreting the law has been \n6ln addition to citing MCl 775.16, a statute presently in effect, the deFendants have also \nmade a number of references in their brief to a bill, HB 5676, that two legislators recently \nintroduced in the Michigan House of Representatives.  A pending piece of legislation has no \nlegal effect.  Dean v Dean, 175 Mich App 714, 717; 438 NW2d 355 (1989).  Nevertheless, \ndefendants appear to suggest that the mere introduction of HB 5676 represents an indication that \nthe resolution of the inadequacies in this state's assigned counsel system should be undertaken by \nthe legislature, not the courts.  If this is the point that defendants would have this Court draw \nfrom the introduction of HB 5676, defendants are seriously mistaken.  HB 5676 proposes much \nmore extensive state control of the assigned counsel system.  According to the bill's two \nsponsors, the Slated purpose of this proposal is \"to ensure the right to counsel under the \nconstitution of the United Slates and the state constitution of 1963.\"  H.B. 5676, § 17.  What the \nCourt should conclude from the introduction ofHB 5676 is that two members of the Micbigan \nLegislature have identified constitutional inadequacies in the assigned counsel system as it \npresently exists.  But, the fact that two members of the Michigan Legislature are in agreement \nwith plaintiffs' claims that the assigned counsel system is constitutionally flawed does not in any \nway displace the courts from their traditional role of determining constitutional rights and \nadjudicating constitutional claims. \n12 \n\noncofthe dcfiningaspects ofj udicial power.\" In re Complaint of RovasAgainst SBC Michigan, \n482 Mich 90, 98; 754 NW2d 259 (2008).  Moreover, as the foundational law of this state, it is \nexclusively the province of the courts to interpret and apply the Michigan Constitution.  See \nGrievance Administrator v Fieger, 476 Mich 231, 253; 719 NW2d 123 (2006) (\"The power of \njudicial review is one that belongs exclusively to the judicial branch of our government\").

The judicial authority consists in applying, according to the principles of right \nand justice, the constitution and laws to facts and transactions in cases, in which \nthe manner or prjJJciples of this application are disputed by the parties interested \nin them. \nld. at 628, n 18, quoting James DeWitt Andrews, ed., I Works o/James Wi/son (Chicago: Callahan \n& Company, 1896), p. 363. \nThe resolution of the constitutional claims raised in this case fits squarely within the \n\"judicial power\" provided in article 6, § I of Michigan's constitution.  As the majority opinion in \nthe Court of Appeals recognized: \nIt is weB-accepted that part of the judiciary's role and function in our tripartite \nsystem ofg overnment is to interpret constitutional provisions, apply constitutional \nrequirements to the facts at hand, and safeguard and protect constitutional rights, \nall through entry of orders and judgments as guided by stare decisis.  That the \njudiciary can declare executive and legislative conduct unconstitutional, can \nprohibit  continuing  unconstitutional  conduct  by  the  two  other branches of \ngovernment, and can demand constitutional compliance, hardly seem to be foreign \nprinciples in the jurisprudence of this state and the country. \nDuncan, 284 Mich App at 337.  Moreover, it is equally well settled that \"under our form of \ngovernment the Constitution confers on the judicial department all the authority necessary to \nexercise its powers as a coordinate branch of government.\" People v Antsey, 476 Mich 436, 451; \n719 NW2d 576 (2006); Maldonado v Ford Motor Co., 476 Mich 372, 390; 719 NW2d 809 \n(2006); In Re 1976 PA 267, 400 Mich 660, 662-663; 255 NW2d 635 (1977).

The  Separation  Of Powers  Issues  Raised  By  Defendants \nCannot Be Addressed In This Interlocutory Appeal \nMuch like Judge Whitbeck's dissent, the defendants' separation of powers argument \nfocuses exclusively on the conclusion of this case and the remedy that the circuit court might \nimpose if plaintiffs were to prevail on their constitutional claims.  Thus, defendants in the \nIntroduction to their brief describe the separation of powers issue which they ask the Court to \naddress as \"[w]hether the relief Plaintiffs seek violates the  separation of powers doctrine.\" \nDefendants' Brief, p. 2. \nAs will be discussed, infra, the defendants have seriously misconstrued the relief that \nplaintiffs are requesting.  But, before proceeding to a discussion of the substance of the possible \nremedies that the circuit court might impose at the conclusion of this case, there is a significant \npreliminary issue that the Court must first address - whether the separation of powers issue \ndefendants seek to raise is ripe for decision. \nThis case was pending in the circuit court for less than three months when all further \nproceedings in that court were stayed at defendants' request. (App. pp. 3a -4a). Defendants then \nelected to proceed to the Court of Appeals on all of the issues they raised in their sununary \ndisposition motion.  It is obvious that this case, in which no answer has been filed, no discovery \nhas been taken and no proofs have been presented, is nowhere near the determination of an \nappropriate remedy.  Indeed, at this early stage in the process, it is possible that the circuit court \nmight conclude that no constitutional violations have taken place and, thus, never reach the \nquestion of the appropriate remedy.  The Court of Appeals majority, while refusing to dismiss \n15 \n\nplaintiffs' cause of action at this early stage in the process, examined the nature ofthe proofs that \nplaintiffs would have to present at trial, Duncan, 284 Mich App at 301-303, and observed that \nplaintiffs will «have a heavy burden to prove and establish their case,\" and that \"proving their case \nwill be a monumental undertaking for plaintiffs.\"  Id. at 303 & n.l3.  Thus, even the Court of \nAppeals majority expressed some doubt as to whether the circuit court would ever be called upon \nto fashion a remedy in this case. \nThis Court is, therefore, being asked by defendants to address a separation ofp owers issue \nwhich has not yet arisen and may never arise in this case.  Under established principles of \nconstitutional adjudication, it is not appropriate for this Court to anticipate the separation of \npowers issue defendants raise in this interlocutory appeal. \nAs this Court has recognized on a number of occasions, \"[f]ew principles of judicial \ninterpretation are more finnly grounded than this:  a court does not grapple with a constitutional \nissue except as a last resort.\"  Musselman v Governor, 450 Mich 574, 577, n.2; 545 NW2d 346 \n(1996); County oJWayne v Hathcock, 471 Mich 445, 456, n. 10; 5684 NW2d 765 (2004); In Re \nRecorders Court Bar Association v Wayne County Circuit, 443 Mich 110, 112, n. 2; 503 NW2d \n885 (1993); Taylor v Auditor General, 360 Mich 146, 154; 103 NW2d 769 (\\960). A necessary \ncomponent of this reluctance  to  decide constitutional questions is that this Court will  not \nanticipate constitutional issues. Thus, the Court has held that, \"[w]here a constitutional question \nis presented anticipatorily, the Court is required by the limits on its authority to decline to rule.\" \nStraus, 459 Mich 545, n.14; see also General Motors Corp v Attorney General, 294 Mich 558, \n568; 293 NW 751  (1940) CConstitutional questions are not to be dealt with in the abstract.\"); \n16 \n\nSullivan v Michigan State Board ofD  enistry, 268 Mich 427, 429; 256 NW 471 (1934).' \nIn addition to these principles applicable to constitution§! litigation, this Court has in \nrecent years sought to delimit the scope of the term 'judicial power\" as provided in article 6, § 1 \nof the Michigan Constitution.  In several cases, the Court has indicated that article 6, § 1 of \nMichigan Constitution compels \"the avoidance of deciding hypothetical questions.\" National \nWildlife Federation, 471 Mich at 614-615; Michigan Citizens/or Water Conservation v Nestle \nWaters North America, Inc., 479 Mich 280, 293; 737 NW2d 447 (2007); Michigan Chiropractic \nCouncil v Commissioner oft he Office a/Financial and Insurance Services, 475 Mich 363, 370; \n716NW2d 561 (2006); Federated Insurance Company v Oakland County Road Commission, 475 \nMich 286, 292; 715 NW2d 846 (2006).  Thus, in at  least four cases written over the last six \nyears, this Court has indicated that there is a constitutional component to the prohibition against \nthe judiciary deciding hypothetical questions. \nIn light of the general rules governing the litigation of constitutional issues as well as the \nlimited scope of the j udicial power provided in article 6, §I of the Michigan Constitution, there \n7Arnong the present members of this Court, perhaps the most extensive discussion of the \nneed to avoid judicial intervention on constitutional questions that have not yet ripened is \ncontained in Judge (now Justice) Stephen J. Markman's partial concurrence/dissent in Mayor of \nCity of Detroit v State o/Michigan, 228 Mich App 386; 579 NW2d 378 (1998), aff'd in part and \nrev'd in part Judicial Attorneys Association v Slate of Michigan, 460 Mich 590; 597 NW2d 113 \n(1999).  In that opinion, Justice Markman indicated that \"(aJ cardinal limitation on the judicial \npower of constitutional review is 'never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance \nof the necessity of deciding it. '\"  228 Mich App at 437, n.8 (Markman J, concurring/dissenting), \nquoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia Steamship Co v Commissioners of Emigration, 113 \nUS 33, 39, 5 S Ct 352; 28 LEd 899 (1885); United States v Raines, 362 US 17, 21; 80 S Ct 519; \n4 L Ed 2d 524 (1960).  Justice Markman further observed in Mayor ofC  ity of Detroit, that \n\"[w]here a constitutional issue is presented anticipatorily, the Court is required to decline to rule \nwith regard to the question.\"  Jd.  at 440-441 (Markman J, concurringldissenting)(emphasis in \noriginal). \n17 \n\nis a considerable amount of irony in the defendants' arguments before this Court. Defendants ask \nthis Court to decide a purely hypothetical separation of powers issue associated with a potential \nremedy that might be imposed in this case. Defendants couch this separation of powers argument \nin the concept ofj udicial restraint. Yet, while offering rhetoric associated with limiting the scope \nofj udicial intrusion on the other branches of government, defendants ask this Court to completely \nignore the prudential andlorconstitutionallimitations im(X>sed on the courts, which categorically \nprohibit the judiciary from anticipating a constitutional question and prevent this Court from \ndeciding what is at present a purely hypothetical issue of law. \nThere is  no  reason  for this Court to anticipate the  separation of powers issue  that \ndefendants ask this Court to decide.  There is no reason for this Court to render what would, in \nessence, be an advisory opinion on the separation of powers implications associated with a \nhypothetical remedy that mayor may not be imposed in  this case.  Once again it must be \nemphasized that defendants elected to bring this case to the Court ofA  ppeals before any discovery \nhad been conducted, before proofs had been assembled or presented and long before the circuit \ncourt made any findings as to the merits of plaintiffs' constitutional claims.  Having chosen to \ntake an appeal at the very earliest stages of the case, the defendants cannot ask this Court to \nanticipate a hypothetical constitutional question associated with a potential remedy that is months \n8 \nor even years away. \n8Defendants have also made some references in their brief to the fiscal implications of \nthis case on Michigan'S treasury.  Once again, it is completely premature to consider the possible \nfinancial effects on the state of hypothetical remedies that might be imposed at the conclusion of \nthis case.  In addition to being premature, any arguments based on the financial impact associated \nwith defendants' compliance with constitutional requirements are inappropriate since the \nvindication of constitutional rights cannot hinge on whether \"it is less expensive to deny [rather] \nthan to afford them.\"  Watson v Memphis, 373 US 526, 537; 83 S Ct 1314; 10 L Ed 2d 529 \n18 \n\nE.  Dcclaratory Rclief In This Case Would Raise No Separation \nOf Powers Concerns \nYet, even ifthis Court were to anticipate the outcome of this case and reach the remedy \nissue raised by defendants, the fact remains that their separation of powers argument must stiB \nbe rejected.  Defendants contend that among the possible remedies that might be imposed in this \ncase is a circuit court order compelling funding for the indigent defense system from the state \ntreasury. Like Judge Whitbeck in his dissent, the defendants further suggest that the remedy being \nsought in this case could result in a court «assum[ing] ongoing operational control\" over the \nassigned counsel system in the subject counties.  Defendants' Brief, p.  IS, noting Duncan, 284 \nMich App at 383. In making these arguments, defendants not only ask this court to address purely \nhypothetical court orders, they also ignore the nature of the relief being sought in this case. Here, \nplaintiffs have requested both declaratory and injunctive relief and this Court has expressly \napproved the use of declaratory relief against the governor.  Duncan, 284 Mich App at 272-273; \nStraus, 459 Mich at 532-533.9 \n(1963). See also Bounds v Smith, 430 US 817, 825; 97 S Ct 1491; 52 L Ed 2d 72 (I 977)(\"[t]he \ncost of protecting a constitutional right cannot justify its total denial.\"). \n9In Straus, which involved a request for declaratory and injunctive reliefagainst \nMichigan's governor, this Court explicitly indicated how the issuance ofa declaratory judgment \ncould avoid the separation of powers concerns defendants raise associated with a circuit court \ninjunction.  This Court indicated in Straus that such declaratory relief«normalLy will suffice to \ninduce the legislative and executive branches ... to conform their actions to constitutional \nrequirements ...\"   459 Mich at 532.  The Straus Court added, «[0 ]n1y when declaratory relief has \nfailed should the courts even begin to consider additional forms of relief in these situations.\" Jd. \nThese observations in Straus provide additional reasons why this Court must refuse to address \ndefendants' hypothetical remedy arguments at this time.  Under the reasoning in Straus, the \nseparation of powers confrontation that defendants ask thi.s Court to anticipate should never \noccur.  Rather, as Straus acknowledges, the circuit court's issuance of a declaratory judgment \nthat the assigned counsel system violates the United States and Michigan constitutions should \nnormally prompt the executive and legislative branches to respond even in the absence of further \n19 \n\nDefendants' separation of powers argument rests on the entirely faulty premise that a \nfinding of liability in this case wilJ automatically  lead to a court-ordered, state funded-and-\noperated system of indigent defense that is subject to continuing operational control by the circuit \ncourt.  But, as Straus demonstrates, this case could end with the issuance of a declaratory \njudgment in which the circuit court simply concludes that, due to the acts and omissions of \ndefendants, the assigned counsel system in the three subject counties violates the state and federal \nconstitutions. \n10 \nThere is one other factor in this case that may become relevant. While ignoring the Straus \nCourt'sapproval of declaratory reliefin these circumstances, defendants have cited language from \nStraus prohibiting a Michigan court from issuing mandatory injunctive reliefa gainst the governor. \nDefendants' Brief, p.  16.  The pronouncements in Straus arose out of a case involving claims \nmade solely under state law.  In this case. however. plaintiffs have a1so asserted a cause of action \nunder the federal civil rights statute. 42 USC § 1983. for violations of their federal constitutional \nrights. \nI I \naction by the court. \n'Ooyhe Court should note that similar suits have ended with negotiations between the \nparties that have led to settlements of their differences which prohibited continuing jurisdiction \nby the trial court.  See e.g. Rivera v Rowland, No. CV -95-0545629 S (Conn. Super Ct filed Jao. \n5, 1995).  In another such case, the court limited its judgment to a declaration that the challenged \nsystem was unconstitutional and returned the issue to the legislature to fashion a system \ncomporting with constitutional requirements.  See Jewell v Maynard, 181 W Va 571, 580-582; \n383 SE2d 536 (1989).  In another suit of this type, the court ordered an interim solution that \nwould be implemented until the legislature enacted its own corrective legislation.  See State v \nLynch, 796 P2d  1150,1161-1164 (Okla 1990). \nliOn page 17 of their brief, defendants claim that plaintiffs' complaint does not contain a \nn \n§ 1983 claim against the governor.  This is incorrect.  Both Counts I and  of the Complaint \na1lege a § 1983 claim against the governor for violation of plaintiffs Sixth and Fourteenth \n20 \n\nII.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING TO RAISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL \nCLAIMS, THESE CLAIMS  ARE  RIPE  FOR ADJUDICATION  AND \nPLAINTIFFS  HAVE  PROPERLY  STATED  A  CLAIM  ON  WHICH \nRELIEF CAN BE GRANTED. \nIn the second issue in their brief, defendants contend that the constitutional claims that \nplaintiffs present in this case are not justiciable because plaintiffs either lack standing, cannot \nestablish \"prejudice\" or because their claims are not ripe for review.  Defendants' Brief, pp. 24-\n38.  Defendants are wrong on all three of these arguments. \nA.  Standing And \"Prejudice\" \nThis Court has adopted the following three part test of standing: \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact\" -an invasion of a legally \nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \"actual or \nimminent, not <conjectural' or 'hypothetical. '\"  Second, there must be a causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complaint of -the injury has to be \n\"fairly ... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not ... th[e] \nresult [of] the independent action ofs ome third party not before the court.\" Third, \nit must be \"likely\", as opposed to merely \"speculative,\" that the injury will be \n\"redressed by a favorable decision.\" \nLee v Macomb County Board of Commissioners, 464 Mich 726. 739; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), \nquoting Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, 504 US 555, 560-561; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 \n(1992). \nIn a case such as this in which the only factual record consists of plaintiffs' complaint, the \ndetermination of whether plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims must be based on the \nallegations contained in that complaint. See House Speaker v Governor, 443 Mich 560, 573; 506 \nNW2d 190 (1993) C'[f]or purposes of determining standing we must 'accept as true all material \nallegations of the complaint, and must construe the complaint in  favor of the complaining \nAmendment rights.  (App_ pp 44b -45b). \n21 \n\nparty.\"') quoting Warth v Seldin, 422 US 490, 501; 95 S Ct 2197; 45 LEd 2d 343 (1975); \nAmerican Family Ass'n ofM  ichigan v Michigan State University Board a/Trustees, 276 Mich \nApp 42, 46; 739 NW2d 908 (2007); see also National Wildlife Federation, 471 Mich at 630-631. \nPlaintiffs have alleged that the assigned counsel system in the three counties denies them \nthis right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment and art. I, §20 of the \nMichigan Constitution, as well as their rights under the due process clauses of both the federal \nand state constitutions. The defendants, however, confine their standing argument to the right to \ncounsel claims raised in this case.12 \nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees that \"[i]o all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall \n... have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\"  US Const, Am VI.  Article I, §20 of the \nMichigan Constitution contains similar language.  In Gideon, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates ruled that if an accused is indigent, the Sixth Amendment requires the state to provide \ncounsel at public expense.  372 US at 344-345.  The Court later made clear that the right to \ncounsel  at the public expense  is  the right  to effective assistance of counsel.  McMann  v \nRichardson, 397 US 759, 771; 90 S Ct 1441; 25 LEd 2d 763 (1970). \nThe Supreme Court has further found that the right to counsel protects both the right to \na fair trial and the fairness of pre-trial proceedings. See Maine v Moulton, 474 US 159, 170; 160 \nS Ct 477; 88 L Ed 2d 481 (1981) (noting that the Court has \"recognized thatthe assistance of \ncounsel cannot be limited to participation in a trial; to deprive a person of counsel during the \nperiod prior to trial may be more damaging than denial of counsel during the trial itself.\"). Thus, \n12Because defendants have failed to challenge plaintiffs' standing with respect to their due \nprocess theory, these claims must be allowed to proceed regardless of the outcome of the right to \ncounsel standing issues which have been raised in their appeal. \n22 \n\na person accused of a crime is entitled to the assistance of counsel not only at trial, but at every \ncriticaJ stage in the pre-triaJ proceedings during which substantive rights may be affected.  See \n-----> \nRothgery v Gillespie COllnty, Texas, 555 US  128 S Ct2578, 2592; 171  LEd 2d 366 (2008) \n(initial court appearance); Coleman v Alabama, 399 US 1, 7; 90 S Ct 1999; 26 L Ed 2d 387 \n(1970) (preliminary hearing); United States v Wade, 388 US 218, 226-227; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L \nEd 2d 1149 (1967) (post-indictment lineup); Miranda v Arizona, 384 US  436,478-479; 86 S Ct \n1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966) (custodial interrogation); Hamilton v Alabama, 368 US 52, 55; 82 \nS Ct 157; 7 L Ed 2d 114 (1961) (arraignment). \nIn  arguing that  plaintiffs do not have standing to raise their claims under the Sixth \nAmendment and article I, §20, of the Michigan Constitution, defendants completely ignore the \nallegations contained in the complaint.  Each of the eight named plaintiffs have aJleged that they \nsuffered an actuaJ or imminent harm as a result ofthe deficiencies in the assigned counsel system. \nComplaint,  ~16-67 (App.  pp.  6b - 18b.)\"  The essence of the actual or threatened harm \nexperienced by the eight named plaintiffs was accurately summarized by the Court of Appeals \nmajority in its June 11,2009, opinion: \nPlaintiff Christopher L. Duncan alleges that he pleaded guilty ofan overcharged \ncrime  that  was  factually  unwarranted  because  of his  attorney's  inadequate \nrepresentation. Plaintiff Billy Joe Burr, Jr., alleges that he had to endure a delay \nbefore an acceptable misdemeanor plea was offered to him, which only occurred \nafter counsel advised him to plead guilty of the charged felony and after Burr \ndemanded that counsel speak further to the prosecutor. PlamtiffSteven Connor \nalleges that there was a basis to suppress a search without a warrant that was \n131t is important to note that plaintiffs' standing to pursue their claims is detennined as of \nthe date the complaint is filed.  See Federated Insurance Company, 475 Mich at 290 (\"standing \nrefers to the right of a party plaintiff initially to invoke the power of the court to adjudicate a \nclaimed injury.\") (emphasis in original); cf Sosna v Iowa, 419 US 393, 95 S Ct 553; 42 L Ed 2d \n532 (1975). \n23 \n\nignored by counsel.

PlaintiffJ ose Davila alleges that \ncounsel failed to discuss the charges with Davila, lied to the court about it, and \nfailed  to challenge a  revision  of the  charges.  Plaintiffs Jennifer O'Sullivan, \nChristopher Manics, and Brian Secrest allege that counsel had effectively gone \nmissing in action, despite the fact that they faced serious charges and that hearings \nand trials were pending. A common thread that runs through all the allegations \nconcerning the named plaintiffs is the failure ofc ounsel to converse with plaintiffs \nin a meaningful manner. The named plaintiffs allegedly experienced conduct that \nincluded: counsel speaking with plaintiffs, for the first time, in holding cells for \nmere minutes before scheduled preliminary examinations while in full hearing \nrange  of other  inmates;  counsel  advising  plaintiffs  to  waive  preliminary \nexaminations without meaningful discussions on case-relevant matters; counsel \nfailing to provide plaintiffs with police reports; and counsel generally neglecting \nthroughout the entire course of criminal proceedings to discuss with plaintiffs the \naccuracy and nature ofthe charges, the circumstances ofthe purported crimes, and \nany potential defenses. They further complain of the following: counsel entering \ninto plea negotiations without client input or approval; counsel perfunctorily \nadvising plaintiffs to plead guilty as charged absent meaningful investigation and \ninquiry; counsel improperly urging plaintiffs to admit facts when pleas were taken; \nand,  counsel  neither  preparing for  hearings  and  trials,  nor  engaging in  any \ncommunications with plaintiffs concerning trials. In sum, the allegations by the \nnamed plaintiffs include instances of representation by counsel that fell below an \nobjective standard of reasonableness in regard to critical stages in the criminal \nproceedings. \nDuncan, 284 Mich App at 318-319.  In addition to the allegations relating to the eight named \nplaintiffs, the complaint also included allegations of hann as to the entire class of indigent \ndefendants.  Thus, plaintiffs have alleged that as a result of the constitutionally inadequate \nrepresentation, the members of the plaintiff class: \n•  Are wrongly denied counsel \n•  Are incarcerated for unnecessarily long periods of time before trial \n•  Are pressured into pleading guilty to inappropriate charges. even when they have \na meritorious defense \n•  Are forced to forego their right to trial out of fear that their assigned counsel \n24 \n\nwould not be prepared for such a trial \n•  Are subjected to lengthy pre-trial delays if they insist on their right to trial \n•  Are subjected to punitive charges if they insist on their right to trial \n•  Are subject to harsher sentences if they plead guilty or are found guilty at trial \n•  Are wrongfully assessed fees \n•  Are denied access to alternatives to incarceration. \nComplaint, ,,141-152 (App. pp. 41 b -43b). \nThus, the complaint contains clear allegations of \"injury in fact\" sustained by both the \nindividual named plaintiffs and the class. The complaint also contains munerous allegations that \nthe denial of plaintiffs' right to counsel is causally related to the conduct of the defendants. \nComplaint, ~'4-11, 28, 35, 44, 51, 56, 63, 67, 85-90 (App. pp. 3b - 5b, 9b, II b, I3b, 14b, 16b -\n19b, 23b -26b).  Under this Court's decisions in Lee and National Wildlife, no further  analysis \nof the standing requirement is necessary since the allegations of the complaint clearly supply all \nof the requirements for standing. \nThe defendants disregard all of the allegations in the complaint bearing on the existence \nof actual or imminent injury resulting from the denial of plaintiffs' right to counsel.  Instead of \naddressing the allegations of actual or imminent harm alleged in the complaint, defendants engage \nin an opaque discussion of \"prejudice.\" Defendants' Brief, pp. 24-36.  Defendants maintain that \n\"the plaintiff who raises the effective assistance claim must establish prejudice.\"  Jd. at.27. \nPlaintiffs do not dispute the fact that they must allege that they have suffered actual or imminent \ninjury or harm as a result of the defendants' denial of their constitutional right to counsel.  But, \nas discussed previously, that is precisely what plaintiffs have done in their complaint, both with \n25 \n\nrespect to the claims raised by the eight individual plaintiffs and in their general allegations \npertaining to class-wide harm. \nIn asserting that plaintiffs cannot establish \"prejudice\" the defendants suggest that under \nthe United States Supreme Court's decision in Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668; 104 S Ct \n2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984), plaintiffs must somehow present something more than the actual \nor imminent harm in fact that they have alleged in this case.14  In Strickland, the Supreme Court \nruled that an individual seeking to overturn a criminal conviction on the ground that he received \nconstitutionally inadequate legal representation at trial must demonstrate that he was \"prejudiced\" \nby counsel's inadequate performance.  fd. at 693. The Strickland Court defined prejudice in that \ncontext as a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's 0 errors, the result of the proceeding \nwould have been different.\"  fd at 694.1\n' \n14The precise position that defendants are taking based on the Supreme Court's decision \nin Strickland is not entirely clear from their brief.  Defendants note that the Slrickland standard \napplies \"in the post-conviction context\" and they specifically state that they are not arguing \"that \nthis Court must apply the Strickland test to the pre-conviction contest [sic].\"  Defendants' Brief, \npp.25-26.  The defendants further describe Slrickland as recognizing that '''prejUdice to the \ndefense' is the applicable constitutional standard no matter where in the criminal process the \ndenial of effective counsel occurs or is raised.\"  Defendants' Brief, p. 27.  Thus, these portions \nof defendants' brief appear to embrace the notion that any prejudice to a criminal defendant \noccasioned by the denial of counsel is sufficient to raise a justiciable issue.  Yet, in other portions \nof their brief, defendants appear to take a completely different position. They contend, for \nexample, that a Sixth Amendment violation is made out only where representation is so \ninadequate that it \"undermine[s] the proper functioning of the adversarial process [so] that the \ntrial cannot be relied on as having produced ajust result.\"  Defendants' Brief, p. 25, quoting \nStrickland, 466 US at 686.  They further suggest that the \"prejudice\" which must exist to support \nan ineffective assistance of counsel claim is prejudice that \"inva1idates the proceedings.\" \nDefendants' Brief, p. 27. \nl'The same day that the decision in Strickland was issued, the Supreme Court ruled in \nUnited States v Cronic, that in the post-conviction context, \"prejudice\" in the form. discussed in \nStrickland is to be presumed in certain cases involving the denial of a Sixth Amendment right. \n466 US at 658-660. The Court in Cronic identified three circumstances in which a criminal \n26 \n\nThus, the \"prejudice\" discussed in Strickland is directly related to the relief being sought \nin that case - the overturning of a criminal conviction.  The Supreme Court specifically ruled in \nStrickland that professionally unreasonable conduct by counsel representing a defendant \"does \nnot warrant seJling aside the judgment ofa  criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the \njudgment.\" 466 US at 691 (emphasis added); cf Sell v Cone, 535 US 685, 695; 122 S Ct 1843; \n152 L Ed 2d 914 (2002) (indicating that Strickland's two part test was designed to \"evaluat[e] \nclaims that adefendants' counsel performed so incompetently in his or her representation ... that \nthe defendants sentence or conviction should be reversed.\") \nThis Court also recognized in People v Carbin, 463 Mich 590; 623 NW2d 884 (2001), that \nthe two-part Slricklandtest was a direct function of the post-conviction relief being sought by the \ndefendant.  In Carbin this Court noted that, \"[a] defendant seeking a new trial on the ground that \ntrial counsel was ineffective bears a heavy burden.  To justiry reversa1 under either the federal or \nstate constitutions. a convicted defendant must satisry the two-part test articulated by the United \nStates Supreme Court in Strickland ... \"  463 Mich at 599-600. \nBut here, unlike Strickland and Carbin, plaintiffs do not seek to have a court review and \nreverse their convictions.  The Court of Appeals  majority correctly confined the ruling in \nStrickland to the circumstances giving rise to that decision: \nIt is our view that  Strickland and its many progeny. which demand deficient \nperformance by counsel and, generally speaking, prejudice in order to entitle a \ncriminal defendant to relief under the Sixth Amendment, have to be understood \nconviction could be set aside for a Sixth Amendment violation in the absence of any specific \nshowing of prejudice.  Id. at 659-660; cf United States v Morris, 470 F3d 596, 601-602 (6\"' Cir \n2006) (holding that Wayne County's practice of assigning counsel immediately before a \"pre \npreliminary examination\" amounted to a \"state impediment to effective assistance of counsel,\" \nand, thus, prejudice was to be presumed. \n27 \n\nand viewed in context. The fundamental flaw in defendants' and the dissent's \nposition on the justiciability issues is that the argument is grounded on principles \nintended to be applied in the context of postconviction criminal appeals that is not \nworkable or appropriate to apply when addressing standing, ripeness, and related \njusticiability principles in this type of civil rights lawsuit. We cannot properly foist \nthe framework of the criminal appellate process upon the justiciability analysis \nthat governs this civil case simply because state and federal constitutional rights \nrelated to the right to counsel are implicated. We reject the argument that the need \nto show that this case is justiciable necessarily and solely equates to showing \nwidespread instances ofd eficient performance accompanied by resulting prejudice \nin the form of an unreliable verdict that compromises the right to a fair trial. \n16 \nDuncan, 284 Mich App at 305.\nIn rejecting the Strickland prejudice standard, the Court of Appeals majority properly \nrecognized that violations of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel take many forms: \nConsistently with the concept of prejudice as employed in criminal appeals, we \nwould agree that justiciable injury or harm is certainly indicated by ashowing that \nthere existed a reasonable probability that, but for an error by counsel, the result \nofacriminal proceeding would have been different. See Carbin, supra at 599-600, \n623 N.W.2d 884. But injury or harm also occurs when there are instances of \ndeficient performance by counsel at critical stages in the criminal proceedings \nthat are detrimental 10 an indigent defendant in some relevant and meaningful \nfashion, even without neatly wrapping the justiciable harm around a verdict and \ntrial. Such harm arises, for example, when there is an unnecessarily prolonged \n161n ruling that the holding in Strickland was limited to the factual circumstances \nunderlying that case, the Court of Appeals was following well established law.  As this Court \nwrote in Hardy v Maxheimer, 429 Mich 422, 431; 416 NW2d 299 (1987): \nThe language used in an opinion of the court must be construed in light ofthe \nfacts and issues involved in a case under consideration and should not be \ninterpreted as going beyond the scope of matters for adjudication. \nsee also Howard Pore, Inc. v Commissioner of Revenue, 322 Mich 49, 72-73; 33 NW2d 657 \n(1948); cf Zenith Radio Corp v United Siales, 437 US 443, 462; 98 S Ct 2441; 57 L Ed 2d 337 \n(1978) (\"general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in \nwhich those expressions are used.\")  Here, defendants have taken Strickland, a case which only \ninvolved an attempt to overturn a conviction on Sixth Amendment grounds, and they have \nsuggested that its \"prejudice\" requirement is to apply to any Sixth Amendment claim, even where \nplaintiffs do not seek to set aside a conviction. \n28 \n\npretrial detention,  a failure  10 file a dispositive motion,  entry of a factually \nunwarranted guilty plea, or a legally unacceptable delay. And as indicated earlier \nin this opinion, simply being deprived of the constitutional right to effective \nrepresentation at a critical stage in the proceedings, in and of itself, gives rise to \nharm. \n284 Mich App at 308-309 (emphasis added). \nThe Court of Appeals majority's ruling that hann in the Sixth Amendment context can \ntake many fonns is entirely consistent with the Eleventh Circuit's ruling in Luckey v Harris, 860 \nF2d  1012,  1017  (II\" Cir.  1988).  In  Luckey,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  held  that, \"[tlhe sixth \namendment protects rights that do not affect the outcome ofa trial. Thus, deficiencies that do not \nmeet the 'ineffectiveness' standard may nonetheless violate a defendant's rights under the sixth \namendment.\" [d.; see also Nicholson v Williams, 203 F Supp 2d 153,240 (ED NY, 2002); New \nYork County Lawyers Association v New York, 745 NYS2d 376, 430-431;  192 Mise 2d 424 \n(2002); cf State v Peart, 621 So2d 780, 787 (La 1993); Rivera v Rowland, 18 Conn L Rptr 117; \n1996 WL 636475 (Super Ct 1996). \nFinally, the defendants have placed considerable emphasis on the New York Supreme \nCourt Appellate Division's July 2009 decision in Hurrell-Harring v New York, 883 NYS2d 349; \n66 AD 3d 84 (NY 3d Dep't 2009).  The New York Court of Appeals is reviewing the Supreme \nCourt's ruling.  The parties in Hurrell-Harring have tiled their briefs and, as of the date of the \nfiling of this brief, oral argument has not yet taken place in the New York Court of Appeals. \nMoreover, the Hurrell-Harring decision on which defendants rely is predicated on New \nYork law regarding justiciability and separation of powers.  883 NYS2d at 351-352.  These \nprinciples of New York law are not applicable to this case.  It is also noteworthy that the relief \nbeing sought by the plaintiffs in  Hurrell-Harring, which the New York Appellate Division \n29 \n\nmajority found objectionable, is substantially different from that requested by plaintiffs here.  In \nHurrell-Harring,  the plaintiffs asked the court to undertake a series of detailed measures to \naddress the inadequacy in New York's assigned counsel system. It was on partly the basis ofLhe \nspecific relief being sought that the New York Supreme Court identified separation of powers \nconcerns.  Id. at 352-353. \nAs discussed previously, this case is  fundamentally different.  Here plaintiffs have \nrequested a declaration thatlhe systemic problems in the assigned counsel system violates their \nrights under the federal and state constitutions. \nB.  Ripcncss \nDefendants expend two paragraphs in their briefarguing that plaintiffs' claims are not ripe \nfor review.  Defendants' Brief, p. 37.  The concept of ripeness \"prevents the adjudication of \nhypothetical or contingent claims before an actual injury has been sustained.  A claim is not ripe \nif it rests upon 'contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not \noccur at all.\"  Michigan Chiropractic Council, 475 Mich at 371, n.l4, citing Thomas v Union \nCarbide Agricultural Products Co, 473 US 568, 580-581; 105 S Ct 3325; 87 L Ed 2d409 (1985). \nOnce again, at this stage in  the process, it  is the allegations in the complaint that must be \nexamined to detennine if plaintiffs' claims are ripe.  Michigan Chiropractic,475 Mich at 379 \n(Young, J). \nIn making their ripeness argument, defendants again ignore the allegations in plaintiffs' \ncomplaint. Plaintiffs have alleged that the individual named plaintiffs and the class have suffered \nor will suffer injury as a result of the constitutional defects in the indigent defense system in the \nthree subject counties. Defendants simply assert that the claims asserted here are not ripe because \n30 \n\nthere has been no \"showing\" that the defendants are responsible for the constitutional violations \nalleged  herein.  Defendants'  Brief,  p.  37.  Whether plaintiffs  have  made a «showing\" of \ndefendants'  involvement in  the constitutional  violations alleged  in  this  case is completely \nirrelevant.  What is relevant is that plaintiff has unquestionably alleged that the constitutional \nviolations suffered by named plaintiffs and the plaintiff class are the result of tbe acts and \nomissions of the two defendants.  (App. pp. 3b-5b, 9b-18b, 23b-26b). \nnI.  THE CIRCUIT COURT'S INDEPENDENT  DETERMlNATION \nTHAT  PLAINTIFFS  HAVE  PROVIDED  SUFFICIENT \nINFORMATION  TO  ESTABLISH  EACH  OF  THE \nPREREQUISITES FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION WAS NOT AN \nABUSE OF DISCRETION. \nPlaintiffs agree with defendants that \"a party seeking class certification is required to \nprovide the certifying court with infonnation sufficient to establish thaleach prerequisite for class \ncertification ... is in fact satisfied.\" Henry v Dow Chemical Company, 484 Mich 483,502; 772 \nNW2d 301 (2009).  But, defendants' arguments as to why plaintiffs have not established those \nprerequisites is based on a misapplication of Henry. This Court in Henry made it clear that a trial \ncourt may certify a class based only on the pleadings when \"the pleadings set forth sufficient \ninfonnation to satisfy the court that each prerequisite is in fact met\", \"such as in cases where the \nfacts necessary to support this finding are uncontested or admitted by the opposing party.\" ld. at \n502-503. Defendants have never contested the facts alleged in plaintiffs' complaint. Instead, they \noffer legal arguments as to why the (uncontested) facts alleged by plaintiffs do not or cannot state \na claim.  Despite this fact, defendants contend that this Court should review the facts for clear \nerror. Defendants' Brief, p. 49.  Consistent with Henry, this Court should not review the circuit \ncourt's factual findings for clear error, but should decide whether that court's decision to certify \n31 \n\na class based on the detailed, uncontested facts in the complaint was an abuse of discretion. \nHenry, 484 Mich at 496.  And, this Court's review for abuse of discretion must be undertaken \nwith the understanding that circuit courts have \"broad discretion to determine whether a class will \nbe certified.\"  Jd.  at 504.  The complaint here, which is 49-pages long, sets forth numerous \nspecific examples to support plaintiffs' claims that defendants have abdicated their responsibility \nto provide the proposed class with constitutionally adequate representation.  The complaint, \ntherefore, provides \"information sufficient to establish that each prerequisite for class certification \n... is in fact satisfied.\" Id. at 502.  For this reason, the circuit court's decision to certify the class \nbased onJy on the pleadings was proper. \nDefendants' challenge to the circuit court's decision to certify the plaintiff class, like their \nchallenge  to  the  circuit  court's  denial  of their  motion  to  dismiss,  is  a  premature  (and \ninappropriate) argument that essentially asks this Court to rule on the merits of the case. In so \ndoing, defendants ignore this Court's clear admonition in Henry that \"courts must not abandon \nthe well-accepted prohibition against assessing the merits of a party's underlying claims at this \nearly stage in the proceedings.\" 484 Mich at 503. Rather than assess the merits of a case, Henry \nreaffinned that the  proper focus for class certification should be an analysis of whether the \nfollowing circumstances exist: \n(a)  the class is so numerous tbat joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(b)  there are questions of law or fact common to the members of the class that \npredominate over questions affecting only individual class members; \n(c)  the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class; \n(d)  the representative parties will fairly and adequately assert and protect the interests \nof the class; and \n(e)  the maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available \nmethods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration ofj ustice. \n32 \n\n484 Mjch at 496-497; MCR 3.501(A)(l). As described in detail below, plaintiffs' complaint \nprovides infonnation satisfying each of these requirements. \nIn addition to misapplying Henry, defendants also rest in part on a mischaracterization of \nthe nature of plaintiffs' claims and the relief that they request.  To be clear, the legal theory \nunderlying plaintiffs' allegations is that: \n(1)  As  a  matter of uniform  policy  and  practice,  defendants  fail  to  provide \nadministrative oversight, support and funding for the indigent defense services \nin the subject counties and thus fail to ensure that indigent defense providers \nhave the tools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense \nin the counties·, 17 \n(2)  as a direct result, aJl plaintiffs face a very real and immediate likelihood that \nthey will not receive constitutionally adequate representation, and in  fact, \nextraordinary numbers do not; \n(3)  defendants are therefore violating plaintiffs' constitutional rights and; \n(4)  plaintiffs are harmed by these widespread and systemic  violations of their \nconstitutional rights. \nTo prevail on their theory, plaintiffs will not have to produce individualized proofs of \nStrick/and-prejudice because, as discussed supra, this is not the standard for pre-conviction \nclaims, which require only a showing ofj usticiable injury or hann. Moreover, this lawsuit will \nnot require individual determinations of injury and compensation because plaintiffs herein do not \nseek money damages.  Instead, they seek declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the class \nas a  whole.  The  circuit  court  properly recognized  that  in  suits  such  as  this  one,  where \nindividualized determinations of injury and compensation are not required. the issue of class \ncertiJication is much more easily resolved.  (App. p.  Ilia). \nThe failure to act can constitute a unifonn policy for which a defendant may be held \n11 \nliable. Cf Powers v Hamilton County Public Defender Commission, 501 F3d 592. 607 (6th eir \n2007) (determining that an allegation that a Public Defender Office had a policy of failing to seek \nindigency hearing on behalf of criminal defendants facing jail time for unpaid fees represented a \ncognizable claim for recovery under 42 USC § 1983.) \n33 \n\nThis case represents the type of litigation in  which class action is not only entirely \nappropriate, but necessary. \"There has been no erosion of the class action as an appropriate means \nof vindicating constitutional rights,\" particularly in situations involving indigent individuals who \nhave no other means to protect their rights.  D.S. v New York City Dep't o/Education, 255 FRD \n59,66 (ED NY, 2008).11 This Court should therefore affirm that the circuit court's certification \nof the plaintiff class was not an abuse of discretion. Henry, 484 Mich at 495-496. \n19 \nA.  Standard of Review \nThe trial court's factual findings with respect to the class certification motion are reviewed \nfor clear error and the decisions within the circuit court's exercise of discretion are reviewed for \nabuse of discretion.  Henry, 484 Mich at 496-497.  Where, as here, defendants' argwnents are \nbased entirely on the legal principles that apply to uncontested facts, this Court's review should \nbe confined to addressing whether the circuit court abused its discretion.  Such an abuse of \ndiscretion occurs \"only when the trial court's decision is outside the range of reasonable and \nprincipled  outcomes.\" SajJian  v Simmons, 477  Mich  8,  12;  727  NW2d  132  (2007);  see \nMaldonado, 476 Mich at 388.  This Court specifically emphasized  in  Henry the \"need  to \npreserve\" the trial court's \"broad discretion to determine whether a class will be certified.\" 484 \nMich at 504. \n\"There being little Michigan case law construing MeR 3.501, it is appropriate to \n13 \nconsider federal cases construing the similar federal court rule (F.R. Civ. P. 23) for guidance.\" \nZine v Chrysler Corp., 236 Mich App 261, 288, n.12; 600 NW2d 384 (1999). \nThe circuit court conducted its class certification analysis prior to the release of this \n19 \nCourt's decision in Henry.  If this Court determines that the trial court did not comply with the \nstandard established in Henry, it should remand the case for reconsideration as it has done in \nHenry and in two post-Henry cases.  Duskin v Dep\" 0/ Human Services, _  Mich _ ; 777 \nNW2d 168 (2010); Brindley v Severs/al North America, Inc, _  Mich _; 775 NW2d 742 \n(2009). \n34 \n\nB.  The Plaintiff Class is so Numerous that Joinder of aU Members is \nImpracticable \nDefendants began their chaJlenge to the circuit court's class action ruling by claiming that \nthe numerosity requirement of MeR 3.50 I(A)(1} (a) was not met here.  Plaintiffs would note as \nan initial matter that defendants have waived their right to contest class certification on this \nground. In their response to plaintiffs' motion for class certification, defendants raised only three \nissues.  (App. pp. 87b-94b). They contended that plaintiffs did not satisfy the commonality and \ntypicality requirements of MeR 3.50IA(I)(c) and (d), and that they failed  to establish that \nmaintenance of the case as a class action would be superior to other fonns of adjudication as \nrequired by MCR 3.50 I (A)(I)(e).  Defendants did not challenge numerosity.  The circuit court \nrecognized this fact at the May 16,2007 hearing during which the class certification motion was \nargued. At that hearing the court correctly noted that commonality, typicality and superiority were \nthe only elements in controversy.  (App. p. 111 a). \nThis Court has held that a failure to raise an issue in the circuit court waives review ofthat \nissue on appeal.  Walters v Nadell, 481 Mich 377, 387; 751 NW2d 431  (2008); Intertown Corp \nv Appeal Board of Michigan Unemployment Compensation Comm., 328 Mich 363, 366; 43 \nNW2d 888 (1950); see also People v Carter, 462 Mich 206, 214; 612 NW2d 144 (2000)(\"The \nrule that issues for appeal must be preserved in the record ... by objection is a sound one.\"). \nEven if defendants had preserved this argument it is clear that the proposed class meets \nthe numerosity requirement. The prerequisite of numerosity is met when the plaintiff class is so \nnumerous thatjoinderofall members is impracticable. MCR 3.50 I (A)(l). As defendants correctly \nacknowledge, \"[t]here is no particular minimum number of members necessary to meet the \n35 \n\nnumerosity requirement, and the exact number of members need not be known as long as general \nknowledge and common sense indicate that the class is large.\" Zine v Chrysler Corp, 236 Mich \nApp 261, 288; 600 NW2d 384 (1999).  Plaintiffs' complaint provides sufficient infonnation so \nthat \"a reasonable estimate of the number of members can be detennined.\" Hill v City of Warren, \n276 Mich App 299, 31 0; 740 NW2d 706 (2007). Plaintiffs have also adequately defined the class \nas \"all indigent adult persons who have been charged with or will be charged with felonies in the \nDistrict and Circuit CourtsofBemen, Genesee, and Muskegon Counties and who rely or will rely \non the Counties to provide them with defense services.\" Complaint ,71 (App. p. 19b). Common \nsense and general knowledge dictate that at any given point in time, hundreds of indigent adults \nwith criminal cases pending in the three counties rely on appointed defense counsel for legal \nrepresentation. Complaint ~ 72 (App. p.  J9b). Thus, joinder is impracticable. \nDefendants do not dispute these allegations. Instead, they contend that plaintiffs fail to \nsatisfy the numerosity requirement because they have not alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate \nthat every single class member will be \"prejudiced precisely because of the deficiencies of \nappointed counsel.\" Defendants' Brief, p. 41. This argument misapprehends both the plaintiffs' \nclaims and the law governing the numerosity requirement. \nFirst, as explained in detail above, plaintiffs do not need to demonstrate Strickland \nprejudice to establish their right to counsel claims under the Sixth Amendment and article I, §20 \nofthe Michigan Constitution.  They simply need to demonstrate real or threatened injury. See \nPennell v City of San Jose, 485  US  1,8; 108 S Ct 849; 99 LEd2d  I (1988).

Defendants' Brief, p. 41.  Instead, Zine detennined \nthat numerosity was not satisfied because the plaintiffs there never \"indicated even \napproximately how many people might come within th[ e class] nor did they indicate a basis for \nreasonably estimating the size of the [class].\" Zine, 236 Mich App at 289.  This criticism of the \nproposed class in Zine does not apply here. \n37 \n\ninjuries, but also make clear that every member of the plaintiff class faces a real or imminent \nthreat of harm so long as they continue to be exposed to this broken system.  Because plaintiffs' \nallegations demonstrate that each member of the plaintiff class has a viable claim for injunctive \nand declaratory relief and  that joinder is impracticable, they have satisfied the numerosity \n22 \nrequiremenL\nC.  Common  Questions  of  Law  and  Fact  Predominate  Over  Individual \nQuestions. \nThe commonality factor is satisfied when there is a common question of fact or law that \napplies to the entire class. the resolution of which will advance the litigation. See Hill, 276 Mich \nApp at 311; Zine, 236 Mich App at 289.  The Court of Appeals has recognized that this factor \n\"does not require all issues in the litigation to be common, it merely requires the common issue \nor issues to predominate over those that require individualized proof.\" Hill, 276 Mich App at 31 1 \n(emphasis in original). Individual issues that are not directly relevant to the actual claims or that \nmay be resol ved after the detennination of a central common question do not defeat commonality. \nlnstead, \"[w]hen common questions present a significant aspect of the case and they can be \nresolved for all  members of the class in a single adjudication, there is clear justification for \nhandling the dispute on a representative rather than on an individual basis .... even though other \n22Defendants have also included in their new numerosity argument a suggestion that \nbecause the proposed class is \"fluid,\" that fact should somehow militate against finding \ncompliance with the numerosity requirement.  Defendants' Brief, p. 41.  Plaintiffs would note \nthat several federal courts have recognized that, where there is fluidity within a class, there is \nmore reason to find numerosity.  See e.g. Matyasoszky v Housing Authority ofC  ity ofB  ridgeport, \n226 FRD 35, 40-41 (D Conn, 2005); Williams v Gill, 98 FRD 463, 469 (ND 111, 1983).  The \ndefendants have also indicated in their brief that it is \"concerning\" that class members might be \nable to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a post-conviction appeal or through \nhabeas corpus proceedings.  Defendants' Brief, p. 42.

Complaint~' 74-75 (App. p. 20b).  The existence of this \npolicy, its systemic impact and its constitutionality are the predominant liability issues in every \nsingle class member's claim. See Dodge v County oJOrange, 226 FRD 177, 181 (SD NY, 2005) \n(\"Case law suggests that, when a uniformly applied policy is challenged, the validity of the policy \npredominates over individual issues.\") Where, as here, \"the class is challenging a uniform policy, \nthe  validity  of that  policy  predominates  over  individual  issues  and  class  certification  is \nappropriate.\" Blihovde, 219 FRO at 620 (citing cases); see also Romano v SLS Residential Inc, \n246  FRD  432, 446 (SD  NY,  2007) (\"[DJefendants  again  argue  that  some  individualized \ndeterminations will be required here. But as noted already this would be the case in almost any \nclass action.

The Court finds that the plaintiffs' \nassertion that the defendants have abdicated their constitutional responsibilities \nby failing to provide adequate representation meets the commonality requirement. \n(App. p. lila). Indeed, in so holding, the trial court aligned itself with numerous courts that have \nrejected challenges similar to those raised by defendants based on the finding that in cases \ninvolving uniform policies, individual issues \"share a common source\" and therefore do not \nthreaten to predominate the common issues in the claim.

In these cases, courts have routinely and explicitly held that specific individualized \nissues regarding whether adequate evidence exists to support a finding of reasonable suspicion \njustifying the search of each individual plaintiff should not destroy commonality. Sec, e.g., \nDodge, 226 FRO at 181-183; Johnson v District a/Columbia, 248 FRO 46,56-57 (D DC, 2008); \nMcBean v City a/New York, 260 FRO 120, 138 (SD NY, 2009); Tardiffv Knox County, 218 \nFRD 332, 336-337 (D Me, 2003); Marriot v County a/Montgomery, 227 FRD 159, 173 (ND \nNY, 2005), \n\"See Tinman v Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 264 Mich App 546, 563-565; 692 NW2d 58 \n(2004) (no commonality where a \"highly individualized inquiry\" involving nwnerous questions \nwas needed to detennine whether defendants violated the statutes in question); Zine, 236 Mich \nApp at 289 (no commonality where seven individualized questions would need to be answered as \nto each class member to determine whether Chrysler had violated the Michigan Consumer \nProtection Act); Lee v Grand Rapids Bd 0/ Education, 184 Mich App 502, 505-506; 459 NW2d \n1 (1989) (no commonality for plaintiffs pregnancy discrimination claims because there was no \nsingle pregnancy leave policy during the relevant period); cf Edgcumbe v Cessna Aircraft Co, \n171 Mich App 573, 575-576; 430 NW2d 788 (1988) (denying certification on the basis of \nsuperiority without mentioning commonality). \n40 \n\ninquiries might have a unique bearing for each class member in a case for damages, in this case \nfor injunctive and declaratory relief they are only important insofar as they establish the existence \nof an environment that subjects every class member to a similar, substantial threat of imminent \nharm. In this way, the \"specific instances\" of harm simply constitute \"a piece in the larger puzzle \nrelative to establishing a basis for prospective, system-wide relief. \"  Duncan, 284 Mich App at \n331-332.  Thus, as the Court of Appeals majority held, ''the factual question that will be 0/a ny \nrelevance to all class members revolves around the establishment of widespread and systematic \ninstances of deficient performance and denial of counsel; the case's viability with regard to all \nmembers depends on an aggregation of harm that is pervasive and persistent.\"  Jd. at 332 \n(emphasis in original).z5 \nD.  Plaintiffs' Claims are Typical oftbe Claims of the Plaintiff Class \nTo satisfY the typicality requirement, plaintiffs must demonstrate that their claims are \nbased on the same legal theory and arise from the same event or practice that gives rise to the \nclaims of other class members. Hill, 276 Mich App at 313; Newsome v Up-To-Date Laundry, inc, \n219 FRD 356, 362 CD Md, 2004).  Plaintiffs need not establish that their claims are factually \nidentical to those of the larger class in order to satisfY the typicality requirement. Hill, 276 Mich \nApp at 313. \"[T]ypicality is not destroyed simply because there are some factual variations \nbetween claims of the representatives and other class members.\" Barnes v District o/Columbia, \n242 FRD 113, 122 (0 DC, 2007). As the trial court correctly held, \"[s]ince all the members of the \nDefendants' argument may be addressed in a full bearing on the merits of the case, but \n25 \nit does not predominate the central question regarding the existence and constitutionality of \ndefendants' unifonn policy that is common to all plaintiffs. See Streeter v Sheriffo  /Cook \nCounty, 256 FRD 609, 614 (ND Iii, 2009); Dodge, 226 FRD at 181-183. \n41 \n\nproposed class challenge the same deficiencies in Michigan's indigent defense system, the \ntypicality requirement has been met.\" (App. p. lila). \nThe typicality requirement is very similar to, and often merges with, the question of \ncommonality. See General Telegraph Co oJSouthwest v Falcon, 457 US 147, 157 n13; 102 S Ct \n2364; 72 L Ed 2d 740 (1982). Therefore, the reasoning discussed in the prior section of this brief \nalso establishes that plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement. \nThis case is similar to Streeter v Sheriff oJCook County, 256 FRD 609, 612 (ND III, \n2009), in which a class was certified in a case challenging a county jail's strip search policy.  In \nStreeter, the court determined that the plaintiffs satisfied the typicality requirement because their \nchallenges all relied on the same legal theory that the defendants' strip search policy violated their \nFourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.ld. at612-613. Here, plaintiffs' \nclaims and those of the plaintiff class all are based on the same legal theory - that defendants' \nuniform policy fails to ensure that indigent defense providers have the tools necessary to provide \nconstitutionally adequate indigent defense in the counties and that, therefore, defendants have \nviolated their obligations under the United States and Michigan constitutions. This plainly \nconstitutes a \"common core of allegation\" that satisfies the typicality requirement. Hill, 276 Mich \nApp at 313. \nDefendants' only response is the assertion that there are too many individual factual \ncircumstances to warrant a fmding of typicality. Defendants' Brief, p. 46. But, \"as in the case of \ncommonality requirement, some individual differences do not preclude certification of the class \nwhere, as here, the name plaintiffs' central claim is the same as the class members.\" Romano, 246 \nFRD at 445; see also Baby Neal v Casey, 43 F3d 48, 58 (3\" Cir, 1994) (\"[C]ases challenging the \n42 \n\nsame unlawful conduct which affects both the named and the putative class usually satisfy the \ntypicality requirement irrespective oft he varying fact patterns underlying the individual claims.\"); \nNewsome, 219 FRD at 362 (finding typicality where «plaintiffs' claims rest on a pattern or \npractice of racial discrimination theory\" notwithstanding factual differences in the treatment of \ndifferent individuals); Otsuka, 251  FRD at 446 (finding typicality because «[a]lthough absent \nclass members may have missed more or fewer rest breaks than the named plaintiffs, all were \nsubjected to the same alleged policies with regard to rest breaks\"). Like Streeter, \"the likelihood \nof some range of variation in how different groups\" of indigent defendants \"were treated does not \nundermine the fact that the claims of each class member share a COllUDOD factual basis and legal \ntheory.\" Streeter, 256 FRD at 613 (internal quotation marks omitted).26 \nE.  Plaintiffs Can Fairly and Adequately Assert and Protect the Interests \nof the Plaintiff Class \nAt the outset, it is important to reiterate that in responding to plaintiffs' class certification \nmotion  defendants  never  challenged  the  assertion  that  plaintiffs  satisfied  the  adequacy \nrequirement.  (App. pp. 85b-ll Ob).  Therefore, defendants have failed to preserve this issue for \nappeal.  But, even if defendants had not waived a challenge to the adequacy requirement, it is \nclear that plaintiffs have provided sufficient infonnation to satisfy this prerequisite such that the \ntrial court's decision to certify the class was not an abuse of discretion. \nToward the conclusion of their typicality and adequacy argument, defendants raise the \n26 \nspecter of a state-wide claim, arguing that «the three named counties are not typical of \nMichigan'S indigent defense system\" and that «[t]his is problematic to class certification here, \nwhere despite attempts to ignore the sweeping posture of Plaintiffs' request for relief, Plaintiffs \nare plainly calling for a centralized, statewide, state-funded system.\"  Defendants' Brief, p. 47. \nGiven that plaintiffs have never made statewide claims or asked for statewide relief, this \nstrawman argument cannot be used to defeat class certification. \n43 \n\nWhether the representative parties can fairly and adequately assert and protect the interests \nof the plaintiff class is a two-step inquiry. First, plaintiffs must establish that their counsel is \nqualified and generaJly able to conduct the litigation.  Second, plaintiffs must establish that \nmembers of the proposed class do  not have antagonistic or conflicting interests.  National \nAssociationf or the Advancement o/Colored People v North Hudson Regional Fire & Rescue, 255 \nFRD 374,383-384 (D NJ, 2009). \nThere is no question that the plaintiffs have satisfied the first prong of this test.  As the \n27 \nSupreme Court of the United States has noted, the second prong of adequacy of representation \n\"tends to merge with the commonality and typicality criteria[.]\" Amchem Products, inc. v \nWindsor, 521 US 591, 626, n. 20; 117 S C12231; 138 L Ed 2d 689 (I 997)(intemal quolation \nmarks omitted); North Hudson, 255 FRO at 384. Consequently, the reasoning outlined above as \nto why there is commonality and typicality also establishes that plaintiffs have satisfied the second \nprong of the adequacy test. \nDefendants' arguments tum on the erroneous assumption that the named plaintiffs cannot \nadequately represent the interests of class members unless they have all experienced identical \nfactual circumstances. Defendants' Brief, pp. 46-47. This is not the appropriate standard. In and \noftbemselves, factual differences do not destroy adequacy. See, e.g. Hill, 276 Mich App at 313. \nDefendants have not challenged the qualifications ofplaintifTs' counsel, who are \n21 \nattorneys employed by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (\"ACLU\").  and the \nACLU Fund of Michigan, nonprofit Jegal organizations whose attorneys have substantial \nexperience and expertise in class action and indigent criminal defense matters.  Plaintiffs are also \nrepresented by Frank D. Eaman PLLC, a private law firm with extensive experience in criminal \nlitigation, and Cravath. Swaine & Moore LLP. a law firm with extensive complex civil litigation \nexperience. In addition to this wide and varied experience, plaintiffs' attorneys have also \ncommitted sufficient resources to represent the plaintiff class. \n44 \n\nWhere, as here, plaintiffs show that any differences between them do not lead to conflicting \ninterests, the adequacy requirement is satisfied?' \nNone of the \"differences\" noted by defendants makes the interests of the class members \nantagonistic to one another. It may be true that some plaintiff class members make bail, while \nothers do not.  It may also be true that some are charged in complex felony cases while others are \ncharged in simpler ones. Defendants' Brief, pp. 46-47.  But these differences do not change \nplaintiffs' core allegation that defendants' uniform practice fails to ensure that indigent defense \nproviders have the tools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent defense in the \nthree subject counties.  Moreover, those differences do not pit plaintiff class members against \neach other. Cf Neal v James, 252 Mich App  12,23; 651  NW2d 181  (2002), rev'd on other \ngrounds, Henry, 484 Mich at 505, n. 39 (determining plaintiffs could not adequately represent the \ninterests of the plaintiff class \"[b]ecause there are claims that some members were denied \npromotions, [and thus] there may be conflicts among the class members related to competitions \nfor the same positions\"). Noneofthe small differences highlighted by the defendants alter the fact \nthat each member of the plaintiffclass is similarly affected by defendants' unconstitutional policy. \nThat the counties  manage and administer their indigent defense systems differently \nlikewise does not deCeat adequacy_ All members of the plaintiff class, regardless of the county in \nwhich they are charged, challenge the failure of the state and the governor to ensure that indigent \ndefense providers have the tools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate defense in the \ncounties.  All  members  of the  plaintiff class  allege  that  this  failure  deprives  them  of \nconstitutionally adequate lega1 representation or places them at imminent risk ofs uch deprivation \nNotably, the potential for conflicting interests is drastically reduced where, as here, \n28 \nplaintiffs seek only injunctive relief and do not ask for money damages. \n45 \n\nby preventing the attorneys in the counties' indigent defense programs from engaging in even the \nmost basic tasks of defense representation. Plaintiffs have thus satisfied the adequacy requirement \nbecause \"[t]he gravamen of the named plaintiffs' claims is the same as that of the other class \nmembers.\" Hill, 276 Mich App at 313. \nF.  A Class Action is Superior to Other Available Methods of Adjudication. \nThe circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that plaintiffs' had satisfied \nthe superiority requirement. To the contrary, its holding was supported by a detailed analysis of \neach of the factors set forth in MeR 3.501(A)(2).  The circuit court ruled at the May 16, 2007 \nhearing: \nFirst, whether the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual \nmembers of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications and \nwhether those adjudications would be dispositive of the interest of other \nmembers not parties to the adjudications. The Court finds that there is a \npossibility of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual class \nmembers which would have a high likelihood in resulting in varying standards \nbeing placed on the defendants. Also these adjudications would likely impair \nthe ability of other class members to protect their own interests. The second \nfactor is not relevant since the proposed class seeks equitable relief. Third, \nwhether the action will be manageable as a class action, I hope so. The Court \nfinds the action will be manageable as there will be no need to determine \nindividual damages. Fourth, whether in view of the complexity of the issues \nor the expense of litigation, the separate claims of individual class members \nare insufficient in amount to support separate actions. Since proving the claims \nwill be highly complex and require the investment of significant resources, the \nCourt finds that a class action would be more appropriate. The last factor is not \nrelevant. There is no monetary value being sought by the proposed class. \n(App. p.  III a). \nDefendants implicitly concede that plaintiffs have satisfied all  but perhaps the least \nimportant factor- manageability.  As the Eleventh Circuit has noted, \"[t]his concern will rarely, \nife ver, be in itself sufficient to prevent certification of a class,\" as \"'[c]ourts are genemlly reluctant \n46 \n\nto deny class certification based on speculative problems with case management\" and \"[e]ven \npotentially severe management issues have been held insufficient to defeat class certification.\" \nKlay v Humana, Inc, 382 F3d 1241, 1272-1273 (II\" Cir, 2004) (citing cases). \nDefendants' argument regarding the manageability component of MCR 3.501( A)(2) is \nsimply a rehash of arguments it has made previously with respect to commonality.  But, as this \nCourt has recognized, \"[0]0 two claims are likely to be exactly similar.\" Dix v American Bankers \nLife Assurance Co of Florida, 429 Mich 410, 419; 415 NW2d 206 (1987).\"  As a result, the \nrelevant concern with respect to this fifth factor is \"whether the issues are so disparate as to make \na class action unmanageable.\" HiI/, 276 Mich App at 717 (quoting Dix, 429 Mich at 419). \nDefendants argue that such disparity exists here. but their argument is based on the \nmistaken assumption  that  individual  factual  inquiries  will  predominate  plainti.ffs'  claims. \nDefendants' Brief, pp. 47-49.  Because \"the arguments made under this factor are essentially \nduplicative oftbe arguments already discussed[,r they should be rejected for the same reasons. \nHill. 276 Mich App at 717 (rejecting defendants' argument that individual inquiries destroyed \nsuperiority on the basis of the court's analysis of numerosity. commonality and typicality). \nMoreover, a court's superiority analysis cannot be conducted in a vacuum. See Hanlon \nv Chrysler Corp, 150 F3d 1011, 1023 (9\" Cir, 1998); Klay, 382 F3d at 1269, 1273. Thus, the \nappropriate inquiry is not whether the class action will create significant management problems \nper set but rather whether the class action will create relatively more management problems than \nanyofthe alternatives that can realistically achieve the plaintiffs' objectives. See Hanlon, 150 F3d \n29 Although Dix was decided under a fonner class certification rule, the Court explicitly \nrecognized that its analysis would apply to MCR 3.501 as well. See Dix, 429 Mich at 414, n 6 \n(explaining that the \"convenient administration ofj ustice\" requirement is essentially the same as \nthat set forth in MCR 3.50 I (A)(I )(e)); Hill, 236 Mich App at 314. \n47 \n\nat 1023; Klay,  382 F3d at 1269, 1273. For this reason, concerns regarding cost and judicial \nefficiency weigh in favor of class certification where the plaintiff class seeks injunctive relief to \nremedy a systemic problem.  See Jones v Mllrphy, 256 FRD 519, 526 (D Md, 2009)(c1ass action \nis superior method to challenge policy ofsuspicionless searches); Newsome, 219 FRD at 363-366 \n(class action is superior method to challenge systemic race discrimination); Welch v Board of \nDirectors oj Wildwood GolfClllb, 146 FRD 131, 138 (WD Pa, 1993) (class action is superior \nmethod to challenge systemic gender discrimination). In such instances, it is both impractical and \nunduly burdensome to require individual class members to sue separately, as this \"would result \nin duplicative, redundant discovery and require mUltiple courts to analyze the same evidence or \nthe same legal issues.\" Kincaid, 244 FRO at 607.30 \nHere. a class action is not merely manageable. but indeed is the only vehicle that could \nprovide any measure of relief if a constitutional violation is found. Individual criminal appeals \nsimply cannot provide plaintiffs with the systemic relief they seek because individual remedies \ncannot  address  the  ongoing  violations  of plaintiffs'  constitutional  rights  resulting  from \ndefendants' abdication of their constitutional responsibilities. Courts have routinelycertifiedclass \naction suits despite potential management difficulties, recognizing that although \"the easiest way \nfor any court to handle complex litigation is simply to deny certification,\" this would have the \nunacceptable result of \"permitting a defendant to violate [the Constitution] with impunity.\" See \nGilkey v Central Clearing Co, 202 FRD 515, 529 (ED Mich, 200 I). Should plaintiffs prevail on \nthe merits of their constitutional claims, it is only if a class is certLfied that this Court (and \nTo the extent the circuit court feels it is necessary. it retains the discretion to create \nJO \nsubclasses to manage its own proceedings as the case develops. Oakwood Homeowners Ass 'n, \nInc v Ford Motor Co, 77 Mich App 197, 220-221; 258 NW2d 475 (1977). \n48 \n\nplaintiffs) can be assured that defendants will accord relief to all individuals harmed by the \nsystemic  failure  alleged  in  the  complaint.  Here,  a class  action  is the  superior method of \nadjudication. \nRELIEF REOUESTED \nBased on the foregoing, plaintiffs-appellees respectfully request that this Coun affinn \nthe Court of Appeals June 11,2009 decision in its entirety and remand this case to the lngham \nCounty Circuit Court for further proceedings. \ned, \n1 \n\\ \nTTO (P4J392) \nting A  y.

In Michigan, provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide for indigent \ndefense.  Here, Plaintiffs do not challenge Michigan's statutory scheme for \nproviding indigent defense, facially or as applied, but rather, seck to have the \njudiciary re-write these statutes by forcing specific State funding and by requiring \noversight by the Governor.  Docs the requested relicfviolatc the separation of \npowers doctrine as embodied in Const 1963, art 3, §2? \nAppellants' answer: \"Yes\" \nAppellees' answer:  \"No\" \nII.  Prejudice to the defense is a necessary component whether raised pre or post \nconviction and must be analyzed on a case-by-casc basis.  Plaintiffs have not pled \nfacts sufficient to demonstrate prejudice in a Complaint based on a generalized \nclaim of widespread syslemic deficiency in Michigan's indigent defense system.  Did \nthe Court of Appeals err when it affirmed the Circuit Court's holding that this case \nis justiciable? \nAppellants' answer:  \"Yes\" \nAppellees' answer:  \"No\" \n111.  For proper classification, Plaintiffs must meet all five well-established requirements \nof a class action.  Here, the proofs are not generalized in nature because the \nchallenge will require the examination of thousands of cases to establish an actual \ninjury traceable to Defendants.  Additionally, the processes used in Berrien, \nGenesee. and Muskegon counties arc dissimilar to one another or other counties in \nMichigan's indigent defense system.  Did the Circuit Court err in certifying the \nclass? \nAppellants' answer: \"Yes\" \nAppellees' answer: \"No\" \nVI \n\n•  • \nINTRODUCTION \nIn this case Plaintiffs seek to abrogate the Michigan Legislature's statutory scheme for \nproviding indigent defense.  But rather than seek legislative change, they instead ask this Court \nto decree sweeping and fundamental changes to the Slale's indigent defense system.  This \nprofound request for reliet: however. is based on nothing more than a generalized claim that the \nlegal representation for a/l indigent defendants in Genesee, Berrien, and Muskegon Counties \nviolates each criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel in the pre-conviction \ncontext. \nPlaintiffs' case is premised on a basic misunderstanding of a criminal defendant's right to \ncounsel.  They claim an abstract right to a particular level and/or quality of representation, and \nassert that they need demonstrate only the absence of this level of representation.  But the United \nStates Supreme Court has said otherwise: \n•  \"The purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a \ndefendant has the assistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the \nproceeding.  Accordingly. any deficiencies in counsel's performance must be \nprejudicial to the defense in order to constitute ineffective assistance under the \nConstitution.,,1 \n•  \"[TJhe right to the effective assistance of counsel is recognized not for its own \nsake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair \nCircuit.  Absent some effect of challenged conduct on the reliability of the Circuit \nprocess, the Sixth Amendment guarantee is generally not implicated. ,,2 \nThe U. S. Supreme Court has never recognized that the purpose of the Sixth Amendment \nis to improve the quality of legal representation.  Neither that Court nor this Court has ever \nrecognized a pre-conviction cause of action based on a generalized constitutional right to \ncompetent counsel claim alleging systemic deficiencies in the representation of indigent \nI Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668, 692; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984) (emphasis \nadded). \n\n•  • \ndefendants.  In fact, the Supreme Court has warned against such claims.  Moreover, neither the \nSupreme Court nor this Court has concluded, or even implied, that the Sixth Amendment right to \ncounsel is to be analyzed under a standard other than \"prejudice to the defense\" in the pre-trial, \nas in the post-trial, context.  Finally, as the United States Supreme Court has recognized, it is the \nrole of courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or \nwill imminently suffer, actual harm.  But it is the role of the political branches, not that of the \ncourts, to shape the institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the \nConstitution.)  These distinct roles are \"obliterated\" if plaintiffs can invoke the intervention of \nthe courts without establishing actual or imminent hann, but instead relying on the mere \"status \nof being subject to a governmental institution that was not organized or managed properly.,,4 \n[n the context of this case three questions are presented.  (1) Whether the relief Plaintiffs \nseek violates the separation of powers doctrine.  That is, may the judiciary override a statutorily \ncreated and locally funded system of legal services for indigent criminal defendants by ordering \nthe Governor to provide such state· funded services, in accordance with judicially created \nstandards and subject to judicial oversight and direction?  (2) Whether Ihis case presents a \njusticiable controversy.  That being, is prejudice a necessary component of a pre·conviction \nclaim for ineffective assistance of counsel?  And if so, whether Plaintiffs can satisfy the \nrequirements of standing and ripeness where the alleged acts have yet to occur and there is no \ninjury-in. fact, and where they have not pled facts sufficient to demonstrate either that the \ninaction of the State and the Governor has caused or will cause the harm alleged, or that the \n2 United Slates v Cronic, 466 US 648, 658; 104 S Ct 2039; 80 L Ed 2d 657 (1984)(intemal \ncitations omitted). \n) Lewis v Cosey, 518 US 343, 349; 116 S Ct 2174; 135 LEd 2d 606 (1996). \nLewis, 518 US at 349-350. \n4 \n2 \n\n•  • \nrelief they seek will fix that hann.  (3) Whether a class action is an appropriate means to \nestablish the requisite proofs for a pre-conviction ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  The \nfirst two questions - whether Plaintiffs' request violates the Separation of Powers doctrine and \nwhether it lacks justiciability - are questions of first impression for this Court. \nThe separation of powers doctrine is violated here because the Circuit Court would be \nrequired to fe-write Michigan's current statutory provisions for indigent defense.  The degree of \nthis violation is further compounded by the fact that the Circuit Court would then be mandating \nthe Legislature to provide that specific funding be included in appropriations, along with the \nrequirement of continuing oversight by the Governor.  Neither the Circuit Court nor the Court of \nAppeals majority adequately addressed the huge practical implications of Plaintiffs' request for \nrelief.  The effect of granting such relief would be staggering, as it would not only add budgetary \npressures to Michigan's already·strained budget but would also be likely to open the floodgates \nto pre·conviction litigation during the pendency of criminal actions. \nThis case does not present ajusticiable controversy.  To establish ineffective assistance of \ncounsel, prejudice is an essential element at any stage of the litigation, pre or post-conviction. \nWhile the test to determine prejudice of unconstitutional proportions in the pre·conviction context \nhas not been fully defined,s this Court should look to Strickland and its predecessors as \nrecognizing that \"prejudice to the defense\" is the applicable constitutional standard no matter \nwhere in the criminal process the denial of effective counsel occurs or is raised.  As in the case of \na post-conviction denial of ineffective assistance of counsel challenge, the pre·trial assertion must \nbe analyzed under the specific facts of each case to detennine whether prejudice of an \nunconstitutional level exists and invalidates the proceedings.  Therefore. at this juncture and on \n, Strickland, 466 US at 685-687. \n3 \n\n•  • \nthe facts pled, Plaintiffs' claims are conjectural and hypothetical; do not and cannot show that \ninaction by the State and the Governor caused the deficiencies they allege; and do not and cannot \nshow that these alleged deficiencies could be redressed by the declaratory and injunctive relief \nrequested here.  Plaintiffs' claims simply are not justiciable. \nThis case is not a viable class action.  Plaintiffs have not met their burden ofpraving \ninformation sufficient to establish that each certification prerequisite has been satisfied.  The \ncommon questions here-whether there have been widespread and systemic constitutional \nviolations, whether the violations were and are being caused by deficiencies in the county \nindigent defense systems, and whether those deficiencies were caused by the State and the \nGovemor-cannot be answered with generalized proofs.  Proving prejudice and causation will \nrequire examination of literally thousands of cases; thus, individual proofs will predominate and \nthe class action will be unmanageable. \nBecause the relief Plaintiffs seek is contrary to core concepts of Michigan government, \nmisapprehends U.S. Supreme Court precedent, and dispenses with basic, foundational pleading \nrequirements necessary to sustain a class action, this Court should reverse the decision of the \nCourt of Appeals. \n4 \n\n•  • \nSTATEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS AND FACTS \nOn February 22, 2007. Plaintiffs - eight individuals arrested at various times in 2006 and \n2007 - filed a four-count Complaint on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of all present \nand future indigent persons who afC or will face prosecution in Berrien, Muskegon, and Genesee \nCounties, and who will rely upon those counties to provide them with defense counsel.  Rather \nthan await adjudication of their cases, Plaintiffs sought declaratory and prospective injunctive \nreliefagainsl the State and the Governor for claimed pre-conviction systemic injuries due to the \nrepresentation from their court-appointed attorneys.  At the time of the Complaint, none of the \nPlaintiffs had gone to trial or otherwise had their claims adjudicated.6  Further, none of the \nPlaintiffs attempted to have their assigned attorneys replaced.  Thus, there is no/actual record \nupon which this Court may evaluate whether any Plaintiff had an inadequate remedy at law or a \nviable ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on that Plaintiffs individual case. \nPlaintiffs allege that the State, rather than the local county funding units or the individual \ndefense attorneys, violated or imminently will violate their rights, as set forth in the Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, §§ 17 and 20 of the \nMichigan Constitution of 1963.  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege systemic barriers to \nCurrently, all representative plaintiffs have been adjudicated.  Christopher Lee Duncan was \n6 \nsentenced on March 12,2007, for breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny and is \nnow serving 1-10 years.  Billy Joe Burr, Jr., was also sentenced on March 12,2007, for unlawful \nuse of a motor vehicle and is now serving three years probation.  Steven Ray Connor was \nsentenced and placed on probation on January 27, 2007.  Upon infonnation and belief, Anthony \nTaylor was sentenced on February 26, 2007 for weapons use, reckless use of a fireann and \nfailure to present weapon for inspection and served 72 days in jail.  Jose Davila was sentenced on \nrd \nApril 12, 2007, for trespass and 3 Degree home invasion and is now serving two years \nprobation.  Christopher Maines was sentenced on May 31, 2007, for 2nd Degree home invasion \nand resisting/obstructing/assaulting a police officer and is now serving 3-22 years (Count 1) and \n21 months-3 years (Count 2).  Brian Secrest hired a private attorney before his May 4, 2007 \nsentencing.  Jennifer O'Sullivan was sentenced in the i h Judicial Circuit, Genesee County, on \nOctober 15. 2007. \n5 \n\n•  • \neffective representation, which they claim create a substantial likelihood of,denying them their \nconstitutional right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard in a court of law.  Such barriers \nallegedly include inadequate State funding for indigent defense services, little State fiscal \noversight or guidance to ensure proper indigent defense services, little State administrative \noversight of indigent defense services, failure of the State to provide sufficient training, legal \nresearch {Ools, experts, or investigators, and failure of the State to provide qual ified indigent \ndefense attorneys.  (Plaintiffs' Complaint, 11118 0-140). \nMichigan's indigent defense system \nThe Court of Appeals' dissenting judge below correctly described Michigan's current \napproach to operating and funding its indigent criminal defense system: \nThe Michigan system for providing counsel for indigent criminal defendants has \nbeen in effect for some time and, from its inception, it has been local in nature. \nIndeed, the Michigan Supreme Court over 100 years ago recognized that the \nprocedure for compensating such counsel under a statute reasonably similar to the \none currently in effect was \"competent\" under then-existing precedent.  [Withey v \nOsceola Circuit Judge, 108 Mich 168, 169; McGrath 403; 65 NW 668 (1895)]. \nThe current statute (the Indigent Criminal Defense Act), as did its predecessor \nversions, divides the system for providing counsel to indigent criminal defendants \nwho are unable to procure counsel into two categories: \nUpon proper showing [of indigency], the chieFj udge [of the circuit court] \nshall appoint ... an attorney to conduct the accused's examination and to \nconduct the accused's defense. The attorney appointed by the court shall \nbe entitled to receive from the county treasurer, on the certificate of the \nchief judge that services have been rendered, the amount which the chief \njudge considers to be reasonable compensation for the services performed. \n[MeL 775.16]. \nThus, the duty to appoint counsel and to detennine reasonable compensation for \ndefense of the indigent at the local level rests with the judicial branch, in the \nperson of the chief judge of the circuit court. The duty to fund such counsel, by \nway of reasonable compensation, rests with the executive branch, in the person of \nthe county treasurer. And the responsibility of providing such funding lies with \nthe legislative branch, usually the county board of commissioners. \nEffective January 1.2004, the Michigan Supreme Court established the procedure \n6 \n\n•  • \nand record-keeping requirements at the local level for selecting, appointing, and \ncompensating counsel who represent indigent parties in all Circuit courts (the \nindigent criminal defense court rule) MeR 8.123.  Section (B) of the Indigent \nCriminal Defense Court Rule provides that each such trial court must adopt a \nlocal administrative order that describes its procedure for such selection, \nappointment, and compensation. Section(C) requires each such trial court to \nsubmit the local administrative order for review to the State Court Administrator \nwho \"shall approve a plan if its provisions will protect the integrity of the \njudiciary.\" Thus, the court rule adds a level of state judicial branch responsibility \nby requiring the State Court Administrator to approve local plans if they will \n\"protect the integrity of the judiciary.,,7 \nOn December 9, 2009, the Michigan Legislature introduced legislation that would create \ns \na statewide public defender system. HB 5676 is currently pending but has not passed the House \nor Senate.  One of the ongoing concerns is how to fund such a system.9  It is clear from the text \nofHB 5676, however, that a statewide indigent defense system will require an appropriation \nfrom the Legislature. 10 \nProcedural histon' \nOn April 5, 2007, Defendants filed a motion for summary disposition, arguing that \nPlaintiffs lack standing and their claims are not ripe for adjudication; that the Circuit Court lacks \n7 Duncan v Siale, 284 Mich App 246, 346-347; 774 NW2d 89 (2009). \n8 HB 5676 of2009, introduced on December 12,2009 and entitled the  \"Michigan public defense \nact,\" would establish a statewide public defender system to provide effective assistance of \ncounsel to indigent criminal defendants who are entitled by law to assistance of counsel at public \nexpense.  (See HB 5676, text of bill in Addendum). \n9 On Tuesday, June 16,2009, the I-louse Judiciary Indigent Defense Subcommittee began \nhearings on the proposed legislation that would create a statewide indigent defense system. \nLaura Sager of the Campaign for Justice referred to the funding issue as \"the elephant in the \nroom.\" See Gongwer News Service, Vol ·48, Report # I 15.  According to testimony by Mary \nLannoy, former Slate budget director and current consultant for the Campaign for Justice, \nmunicipal courts and counties currently spend approximately $80 million on indigent defense; \nyet compared to per capita spending by other States, she explained that Michigan should be \nsfending approximately $125 million. \nI  !-IS 5676 states, \"The legislature shall annually make an appropriation to the public defense \nfund to implement this act and to ensure that the right to counsel under the constitution of the \nUnited Slales, the stale constitution of 1963, and this acl is adequately funded.\" HB 5676. \n(Addendum, Sec 17(4), p 22). \n7 \n\n•  • \njurisdiction over this matter because the Legislature, not this Court, is the proper entity to \nappropriate funds from the state treasury; that Plaintiffs improperly seek prospective injunctive \nrelief because Plaintiffs fail to show that they lack an adequate remedy at law and failed to allege \nfacts establishing a viable due process claim; that Plaintiffs sued the wrong parties; that the Court \nlacks jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief against the Governor; that governmental immunity \nbars the reliefsought against the Governor as to Plaintiffs' State Constitutional claims; and, that \ngovernmental immunity bars the claims brought against the State of Michigan. \nOn May 16,2007, Ingham County Circuit Court heard argwnent regarding Defendants' \nMotion for Summary Disposition and Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification.  The Circuit \nCourt rendered an oral opinion from the bench, denying the summary disposition motion and \ngranting the class certification motion.  She also entered an order granting Defendants' motion \nfor stay. \nOn June 5, 2007, the Circuit Court issued three separate written orders:  1) an order \ndenying Defendants' mOlion for summary disposition; 2) an order granting class certification; \nand, 3) an order denying Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the order granting stay issued \non May 16,2007.  The Circuit Court found that Plaintiffs had standing and their claims were ripe \nfor review.  The Circuit Court stated it was unsure whether the Slrickland standard applied to \nPlaintiffs' pretrial claims of constitutionally inadequate representation, but concluded that it \nwould not have to examine the circumstances of each particular criminal case.  Thus, the Circuit \nCourt held that Plaintiffs had stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. \nDefendants filed three separate pleadings in the Court of Appeals to address various \naspects of the Circuit Court's ruling.  First, Defendants filed a claim of appeal by right of that \npart of the lower court's June 5, 2007 Order that denies governmental immunity to Defendants. \n8 \n\n•  • \n(Court of Appeals #278652).  Second, Defendants filed an application for leave to appeal \nregarding the remaining aspects of the Circuit Court's ruling denying summary disposition. \n(Court of Appeals # 278858).  Third, also pursuant to MCR 7.203(8)(1), Defendants sought \nleave to appeal the Circuit Court's June 5, 2007 Order Granting Class Certification. (Court of \nAppeals # 278860). \nOn February 22. 2008, the Court of Appeals granted the two applications for leave, and \non March 26, 2008, granted Defendants' motion to consolidate the three separate appeals. \nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the orders of the Circuit Court, holding that: \ndefendants are not shielded by governmental immunity. that defendants are proper \nparties, that the trial court, nOl the Court of Claims, has jurisdiction, and that the \ntrial court has jurisdiction and authority to order declaratory relief, prohibitory \ninjunctive relief, and some level of mandatory injunctive relief, the full extent of \nwhich we need not presently define.  We further hold that, on the basis of the \npleadings and at this juncture in the lawsuit, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged \nfacts that, if true, establish standing, establish that the case is ripe for adjudication, \nand state claims upon which declaratory and injunctive relief can be awarded. \nFinally, we hold that the trial court properly granted the motion for class \n. r.  .  II \ncertillcauon. \nThe 37-page dissenting opinion, however, concluded that the reliefrequested by \nPlaintiffs would violate the Separation of Powers doctrine; that Plaintiffs' claims are not \njusticiable; and, that the Circuit Court erred in certifying the class.12 \nOn July 23, 2009, Defendants filed their application for leave to appeal to this Court.  On \nDecember 18, 2009, this Court granted leave to appeal. \n11  Duncan, 284 Mich App at 254-255. \n12 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 343-344, 396-399. \n9 \n\n•  • \nARGUMENT \nI.  In Michigan, indigent defense is governed by provisions of the Code of Criminal \nConduct.  Here, Plaintiffs do not challenge the current statutory scheme, facially or \nas applied, but rather, seek an order that would essentially re-draft current statutes, \ndirecting specific funding by the State and oversight by the Governor, contrary to \nthe Legislature's intent and in violation of the Separation of Powers doctrine. \nA.  Standard of Review \nA circuit court's decision regarding a motion for summary disposition is reviewed de \nnovo.13  Constitutional issues and statutory interpretation are also reviewed de novo.14  Questions \nof justiciability implicate constitutional separation of powers principles. IS \nB.  Analysis \nIn Michigan, appointed counsel is governed by provisions of the Code of Criminal \n16 \nProcedure. Under the statutory scheme, appointment of counsel is handled at the local level; \ncounsel is appointed by the circuit court and funded by the county treasury: \nUpon proper showing, the chief judge shall appoint . . . an attorney to conduct \nthe accused's examination and to conduct the accused's defense. The attorney \nappointed by the court shall be entitled to receive from the county treasurer ... \nreasonable compensation for the services perfonned.11 \nProviding for appointed counsel at the local level is a framework this Court has approved \nfor over 100 years.18  This Court has recognized that \"a potential myriad of local considerations\" \nmay contribute 10 the detennination of what compensation is reasonable, and that detennination \nIl Sun Communilies v Leroy Twp, 241 Mich App 665, 668; 617 NW2d 42 (2000). \nWayne Co v H(({hcock, 471 Mich 445, 455; 684 NW2d 765 (2004). \n14 \n15 Michigan Chiropractic Council v Comm'r ofrlle Office of Fin & Ins Servs, 475 Mich 363, 369 \n(2006) (citing Na!,1 WildliJe Federalion v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, 471  Mich 608; 684 NW2d \n800 (2004), and Lee v Macomb Co Bd ofComm'rs, 464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900 (2001)). \n16 MeL 775.16. \n17 MCL 775.16.  The State provides limited supplemental funding through the Court Equity \nFund.  MCL 600.151.  MeR 8.123 sets forth the procedure for selecting, appointing, and \ncompensating counsel who represent indigent parties. \n18 See Wilhey v Osceola Circuil Judge, 108 Mich 168; 65 NW 668 (1895). \n10 \n\n•  • \nmay vary from one circuit to another. 19  Thus, challenges to the system appointing counsel are \nusually brought at the local level where that system is created and implemented?O This is \nconsistent with the funding of all functions related to the operation of the trial courts, which is \nimposed on the local funding unit, with certain statutory exceptions,21 \nIn this case, however, Plaintiffs do not simply challenge the local system for appointment \nof counsel.  As described by the dissent, Plaintiffs seek to implement a new statewide system \nthrough the courts rather than the Legislature: \n[T]he Duncan plaintiffs do not challenge the constitutionality of that act, either \nfacially or \"as applied.\" Rather, they simply seek to override it, to \"switch it off' \nas it were. The Duncan plaintiffs do not ask the judiciary to \"say what the law is\" \nwith respect to the indigent criminal defense act.  Nor do they challenge the \nLegislature's enactment of that statute. Rather, they seek to reshape the indigent \ncriminal defense act in a way that they find more desirable. In essence, they seek \nto have the judiciary make the law rather than say what the law is. \nIt is precisely to such an approach that the doctrine of separation of powers \ndirectlyappliesY \nIn fact, Plaintiffs do not even name county officials as parties.  Instead, they seek broad \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against the State and Governor, requiring them to defend \nsystems over which they have no statutory control or authority, for which they have no data or \nother evidence, and about whose operations they have no specific knowledge.  Contrary to the \nmajority opinion below, the relief sought violates the separation of powers by giving a trial court \ncontrol over functions perfonned by the legislative and executive branches.  Further, such \nextraordinary reliefis unnecessary as Plaintiffs have other available remedies, such as simply \n19 Recorder's Courl Bar Ass'n v Wayne Circuit Court, 443 Mich 110, 129; 503 NW2d 885 (1993). \n20 See Recorder's Court Bar Ass'n, 443 Mich at 110. \n\"  MCL 600.8301; MCL 600.9947. \n22 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 387 (Whitbeck J., dissenting). \n11 \n\n•  • \nfiling their suit against those counties in which service is challenged or pursuing an ineffective \nassistance of counsel claim on appeal from a conviction. \nI.  The Court of Appeals erred in allowing the Circuit Court to order \nfunding from the State Treasury for specific purposes such as training \nprograms, payment of expert fees, and payment of counsel's fees since \nsuch relief usurps the power of the Legislature. \nPursuant to Const 1963, art 9, § 17, only the Legislature can appropriate funds from the \nState Treasury.23  As this Court explained in 461h Circuit Trial Court v County o/Crawford, the \n24 \npower to tax and appropriate is one of the most fundamental aspects of the Legislature. This is \nbecause, unlike the other branches, the Legislature is designed for such purpose: \nIn contrast with the judiciary, for example, the legislature is not restricted in \nthe range of testimony that it may hear as a prelude to enacting public policy, \nit is better positioned to accommodate competing policy priorities, it is better \nequipped to effect compromise positions after negotiation and bargaining, it is \nmore regularly and directly accountable to the people, and its membership is more \n25 \nbroadly representative of society and its various interests.\nFurther, as this Court recognized in National Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs iron \nCo, \"it is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape the institutions of \ngovernment in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution .... The distinction \nbetween the two roles would be obliterated if, to invoke intervention of the courts, no actual or \nimminent hann were needed, but merely the status of being subject to a governmental institution \nthat was not organized or managed propcrly.,,26 \nBut that is exactly what is happening in this case.  Even accepting the hypothetical nature \n23 Const 1963, art 9, § 17; Musselman v Engler, 448 Mich 503, 522; 533 NW2d 237 (1995). \n24 46\"  Circuit Trial Court v County ofC  rawford, 476 Mich 131, 141; 719 NW2d 553 (2006). \n25 461h Circuit Trial Courl, 476 Mich at 142. \n26 Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 471  Mich at 619-620 (quoting Lewis, 518 US at 349-350; 116 S Ct 2174; \n135 L Ed 2d 606 (1996». \n12 \n\n• \n• \nof Plaintiffs' prospective allegations, the relief requested is a court·ordered appropriation from \nthe State Treasury for specific purposes, including: \n•  Money for the same or similar training as prosecUling attorneys. (~ 91). \n•  Access to the Michigan State Police Forensic Science Division. (  92). \n•  Reimbursement for collect calls to counsel. (  134). \n•  Money to hire investigators.

( ~ 138-140). \n•  Statewide standards for eligibility, attorney training and access to resources.  (~94). \nNotably, the need for an appropriation from the State Treasury is underscored by the language of \nHB 5675, a pending bill that would create a statewide indigent defense system.  HB 5676 \nmandates that the Legislature make an annual appropriation to the public defense fund to \nimplement the Act. 27 \nRather than squarely addressing this issue, the Court of Appeals adopted a blind eye and \ndeaf ear approach. While acknowledging that funding is at the core of this action, the Court of \nAppeals nonetheless deemed it \"unnecessary\" to reach the issue: \nWe further recognize that, should plaintiffs prevail, funding and legislation would \nseemingly appear to be the measures needed to be taken to correct constitutional \nviolations. However, we are not prepared to rule on the issue whether the trial \ncourt has the authority to order appropriations, legislation, or comparable steps. It \nis unnecessary to do so at this juncture in the proceedings.28 \nThe Court of Appeals then suggested that \"if the state takes corrective action without further \nneed for intervention by the trial court, injunctive relief and the authority to issue constitutionally \nquestionable fOnTIS of such relief would no longer be at issue ... 29  Thus, because the Court of \nAppeals could \"only speculate at this time regarding the measures ultimately needed to be taken \n27 HB 65760[2009.  (Addendum I, Sec 17(4), p 22). \n28 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 279. \n29 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 279. \n13 \n\n•  • \nin order to come into compliance,\" it declined to reach the issue.30  \"Only when all other \npossibilities are exhausted and explored ... does there arise issues regarding appropriations and \nlegislation, the separation of powers, and the full extent of court jurisdiction and authority. ,,31 \nThe problem with this approach, however, is that it ignores the very standard that a court must \napply on review, as well as the realistic impact of continuing what is, ultimately, futile litigation. \nIt fails to recognize that the authority oflhe Circuit Court to order additional and specific funding \nfrom the Slale is squarely at issue, as that is precisely the relief demanded by Plaintiffs and a \n32 \nbasis upon which Defendants sought summary disposition.\nFurthennore, while the Court of Appeals disclaims ruling on the separation of powers \nissue, it went on to do so, interpreting this Court's opinion in 461h Circuit Trial Court to arguably \nsupport the Circuit Court's authority to order the State funding sought by Plaintiffs: \nI f indeed there exist systemic constitutional deficiencies in regard to the right to \ncounsel and the right to the effective assistance of counsel, it is certainly arguable \nthat 46th Circllit Trial Court lends authority for a court to order defendants to \nprovide funding at a level that is constitutionally satisfactory. The state of \nMichigan has an obligation under Gideon to provide indigent defendants with \ncourt-appointed counsel, and the \"state\" is comprised of three branches, including \nthe judiciary. Const 1963, art 3, § 2. Ultimately, it is the judiciary, on a daily \nbasis, that is integrally involved with ensuring that, before prosecutions go \nforward, indigent defendants are provided counsel, without which the court could \nnot carry out its constitutional responsibilities.3) \nThus, as the Court of Appeals' dissent accurately describes, the majority opinion \n30 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 280. \nJl Duncan, 284 Mich App at 280-28\\. \n32 As the dissenting opinion nOles, Plaintiffs' claims are inexorably tied to a statewide rather than \na county-administered system. See footnote 1 of the dissenting opinion, which recites numerous \nallegations by Plaintiffs that are tied to specific funding and oversight by the State.  Duncan, 284 \nMich App at 344, 345, n 1 (Whitbeck, J. dissenting). \n33 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 283-284.  The \"sharply circumscribed\" inherent power to sclf \nappropriate \"necessary\" funding does not include the relief requested by Plaintiffs, particularly \ngiven that 461h Circuit contemplates an impasse between the judiciary and legislature rather than \nPlaintiffs' suggestion for beller operation.  See 461h Circllit Trial COllrt, 476 Mich at 142-144. \n14 \n\n•  • \neffectively hands over to the Circuit Court not only legislative discretion on the proper public \npolicy to implement but also the Legislature's checkbook: \n[T]he majority has issued an open invitation to the trial court to assume ongoing \noperational control over the systems for providing defense counsel to indigent \ncriminal defendants in Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon counties. And with \nthat invitation comes a blank check, to force sufficient state level legislative \nappropriations and executive branch acquiescence to bring those operations \nto a point -- if such a point could ever be achieved -- that satisfies the trial court's \ndetennination of the judiciary's responsibilities to carry out its functions in a \n\"constitutionally sound manner. ,,34 \nPlaintiffs are not simply challenging the indigent defense services in these three counties. \nThey have framed their action, allegations, and relief to require specific appropriations from the \nState Treasury.  The issue for summary disposition is not just whether Plaintiffs can show that \nservices are deficient, but also whether they may use the courts to force specific state funding \n3s \nand oversight to correct these deficiencies.\n2.  The Court of Appeals erred in allowing the Circuit Court to order the \nGovernor to administrate local systems dictated by the judiciary. \nSuch relief usurps the power of the executive branch. \nUnder Mich. Const. 1963, art. 5, § 1, executive power is vested in the Governor.  Among \nher duties, the Governor is charged with enforcing the laws of the State36 and proposing a budget \n37 \nfor the ensuing fiscal year.\nHere, Plaintiffs attempt to elevate these issues from the local funding level to the State. \nPlaintiffs allege the Governor has failed to enforce their right to effective assistance of counsel \nby ceding oversight and funding to the counties and failing to provide adequate state funding. \n34 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 383. \n3S \"[T]here are multiple correct methods of pre funding, and the method most appropriate in a \nspecific situation is a matler of policy. \"  Musselman v Governor, 450 Mich 574, 584; 545 NW2d \n346 (1996). \n36 Const 1963, art 5, § 8. \n37 Const 1963, art 5, § 18. \n15 \n\n•  • \n(Complaint, ~~ 10, 11,88, 89, 104, 141, 156, '157, 160, 163, 164, 167, 170, 171, 174, 177, 178, \nand 181).

Therefore, in addition to declaratory relief, Plaintiffs requested that the \nCircuit Court, \"[p]ermanently enjoin Defendants from subjecting Plaintiffs to practices that \nviolate their rights,\" \"[o]rder appropriate relief requirement Defendants to provide indigent \ndefense programs and representation consistent with the requirements of the United States and \nMichigan Constitutions,\" and \"[gJrant such other and further ... equitable relief as the Coun \ndeems appropriate, just and proper to protect Plaintiffs form further hann by Defendants.\" \n(Compliant, Relief Requested). \nAs far back as 1874, in the seminal case Sutherland v Governor, this Court has expressed \n4o \nconcern over such relief violating the separation ofpowers. More recently, in Siraus v \nGovernor, this Court expressed its \"doubt with respect to the propriety of injunctive reliefagainst \nthe Governor,\" stating, \"It is clear that separation of power principles ... preclude mandatory \ninjunctive relief, mandamus, against the Governor.,,41 \nThe Court of Appeals, however, disagreed.  After noting Plaintiffs also seek declaratory \nand prohibitory injunctive relief.- and suggesting such relief could include prohibiting \n38 MCL 600.8301; MCL 600,9947, \n39 The SCAO, however, is an arm of the judiciary.

This analysis, \nemployed by the Court of Appeals, completely misses the mark. \nDefendants do not seek to immunize the Governor from federal constitutional violations \nthrough the operation of State law.  To the contrary, Defendants seek to avoid an \nunconstitutional exercise of power to correct perceived errors in state law.  As the dissent \n42 \"Such a remedy could potentially entail a cessation of criminal prosecutions against indigent \ndefendants absent constitutional compliance with the right to counsel.\"  Duncan, 284 Mich App \nat 273. \n4J Duncan, 284 Mich App at 273, 274. \n44 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 274 (quoting Will v Michigan Dep't a/State Police, 491  US 58, 71 \nn10; 109 S Ct 2304; 105 L Ed 2d 45 (1989)). \n45 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 275. \n17 \n\n•  • \naccurately observes, the policy implications of allowing the relief Plaintiffs seek are \n\"staggering,\" putting the judicial branch in charge of funding, the executive branch in charge of \ncourt administration, and a circuit court in one county in charge of court rules and funding for \nother counties: \nFirst, such operational control would override the explicit provisions of the \nIndigent Criminal Defense Act. \nSecond, such operational control would give the trial court the opportunity. and \nperhaps even the obligation, to nullify the provisions of the indigent criminal \ndefense court rule, thereby superseding the authority of the Supreme Court and \nthe Stale Court Administrator. \nThird, vesting such operational control in one circuit court creates the anomaly of \ngiving that circuit court the power to direct some of the operations of three other, \ntheoretically co·equal, circuit courts. \nFourth, the record of judicial operational control of executive branch operations, \nsuch as prisons and schools, has been, to be charitable, decidedly mixed. \nFifth, and finally, such operational control is in direct contravention of the basic \n46 \nconcept of separation of powers.\nThe dissent is correct.  The sort of operational control contemplated in Plaintiffs' action, \nand at least left open by the Court of Appeals, would violate the separation of powers.  The issue \nis not whether any scenario exists under which a court could issue mandamus against the \nGovernor, but rather, what set of facts could possibly warrant issuing such an extraordinary \nremedy in this case.  If, as Plaintiffs allege, the counties and SCAO are not fulfilling their duties \nset forth by statute and court rule, it is not for the Governor to rush in and take over those \nfunctions.  Nor is it proper for the courts to order her to do so.  The Governor may exercise \nauthority over the judicial branch under Const 1963, art 3, § 2 only when explicitly authorized by \nthe Constitution.  Nothing in Michigan's Constitution authorizes the Governor to exercise \nDuncan, 284 Mich App at 383, 384 (Whitbeck, J., dissenting). \n46 \n18 \n\n•  • \nsupervisory authority over the judicial branch.  The administration of the courts through SCAO \nand the adoption of court rules are functions of the \"One Court of Justice\" system under Const \n1963, art 6, § 1.  Rather, the Legislature may choose to implement and fund a statewide system. \nAnd, of course, each Plaintiff has a cause of action in that county where the violation is alleged. \n3.  Having brought their action against the State and Governor, rather \nthan those counties in which service is challenged, Plaintiffs lack \nstanding and fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \nMichigan's current statutory scheme provides for appointment of counsel to indigent \n47 \ndefendants at the locallevel in which the trial court determines and awards reasonable \ncompensation for appointed attomeys:u  The counties pay the appointed attorney the amount the \ncounty's chief judge considers reasonable compensation for the services performed.49  Plaintiffs \ndo not, however, challenge the current statutory scheme, facially or as applied.  Despite claiming \ninadequate service from the counties, Plaintiffs have not sued any county officials.5o  Thus, as \nnoted in the dissent below, it is possible the Circuit Court could grant the requested relief without \nsl \nany determination of the facial or as applied validity of the current statutory scheme.\nAs this Court explained in National Wildlife, it is not for the judiciary to decide matters \n52 \nof public policy- a limitation that is maintained in large part through the doctrine of standing.\nBecause administration of any statute \"is essentially a matter of public and not of individual \nconcern,\" a party must be able to show actual or imminent injury as the result of its enforcement. \nMeL 775.16. \n47 \n<8 fn re Allorney Fees oj Mllllkoff, 176 Mich App 82, 85; 438 NW2d 878 (1989). \n49 fn re Jacobs, IS5 Mich App 642, 645; 463 NW2d 171  (1990).

They further argued that \nthe nature and scope of relief must await the completion of discovery, the development of a \nfactual record, a hearing or trial on the merits, and a finding of unconstitutionality.

Plaintiffs cannot avoid its import by masking their pleas for funding and \nmassive overhaul behind a \"mere\" request for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs argue \nthey seek only declaratory and injunctive relief, but their Complaint, the relief sought and the \narguments presented in opposition brief on appeal belie this claim. 58 \nIndeed the essence of their Complaint is a funding issue and an effort for a sweeping \noverhaul of the current county system by creating a statewide, state-funded system.  The granting \nof requested relief here would require the judicial exercise of both executive and legislative \npower by determining the system, the type and quality of services required, and the level of \nappropriation needed to meet constitutional muster- all without first deciding that Plaintiffs \nhave actually suffered a \"prejudice to their defense.\"  This action seeks to avoid the available and \nnecessary executive and legislative processes to effect a change in the State's appointed counsel \nsystem, substituting ajudicial solution that compels specific executive and legislative action \nwhile removing all discretion and deliberate process from their decision-making.  Defendants \nS8 For example, while Plaintiffs contend that their Complaint does not ask for court-ordered \nappropriation from the State Treasury (App'ees Resp Br to App for Leave at p 8), they allege that \nDefendants have failed to \"take any steps to ensure that the indigent defense services in the \nCounties are adequately funded and administered.\" (Compl, p 10, emphasis added).  Their \nComplaint also broadly alleges that it is Defendants' failure to \"provide funding or oversight\" to \nthe named counties or \"any of the State's counties\" that has created a \"broken indigent defense \nsystem.\"  (Compl, p 11, emphasis added).  Indeed, in addition to asking the Court to declare \nDefendants' actions unconstitutional and unlawful and to permanently enjoin Defendants from \nviolating their rights, Plaintiffs' Complaint requests that the court \"order appropriate relief \nrequiring Defendants fO provide indigem defense programs and representation consistent with \nthe requirements of the United States and Michigan Constitutions\" and [g]rant such Ofh  er and \nfur/her declaralqry and equitable relief as the Court deems appropriate, just and proper. \n(Complaint, p 48, emphasis added.) \n22 \n\n•  • \nwould be exposed to continuous enforcement actions once such a declaration and injunction \nwere entered. \nAbsent a reversal of the Court of Appeals majority here, this Court needs to anticipate the \nvery real probability that it leaves in the hands of a single circuit court the ability to order the \nadoption and funding ofa statewide indigent defense system.  That this \"might not happen\" is of \nlittle comfort.  Under any potential remedy offered by Plainliffs--even alternative remedies \n\"negotiated\" in the course oftbis litigation- the judiciary forces the other branches of \ngovernment to restructure the indigent defense system and its funding to comply either with a \njudicially enacted program or its threat.  Essentially, this Court is being asked to engage in risk \nanalysis- which is a function to be perfonned by our Legislature, not our courts. \nThe Supreme Court of New York recognized a similar challenge to its appointed counsel \nprogram as being a clear violation of the Separation of Powers doctrine in Hurrell-Harring v \nS9 \nStafe oJNelV York. There, the Court determined plaintiffs' claims were notjusliciable and \ndismissed the complaint, recognizing that the \"deficiencies\" alleged by the class of indigent \ndefendants had \"more to do with how these programs are funded and administered than how \nindividuals have been deprived of the meaningful assistance of counsel in defending against \ncriminal charges pending against them. ,,60  Ln that Court's view, \"complex choices that entail \nselecting among competing priorities and allocating finite resources are matters best left to the \nsound exercise of the discretion of the coordinate branches of government and are not the type \nthat the Judiciary, to be frank, is designed or well suited to make.,,61  Here, Defendants' \n59 Hurrell-Harring v New York, 883 NYS 2d 349, 352, 353 (App Div 2009). \n60 Hurrell-Harring, 883 NYS 2d at 351-352. \n61 Hurrell-Harring, 883 NYS 2d at 352 (internal citations omitted). \n23 \n\n•  • \nseparation of powers argument is ripe for review and Plaintiffs' case should be dismissed because \nit seeks relief that constitutes a prima facie violation of the separation of powers. \nII.

Discussion \nThe Sixth Amendment provides, \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the \nright ... . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense. ,,64  The Michigan Constitution \n65 \nprovides for the same right. [n Gideon v Wainwright, the U. S. Supreme Court set forth the \nimportance of providing counsel for indigent criminal defendants.66  Defendants do not question \nthat importance.  Gideon did not, however, address the effectiveness of appointed counsel who \nrepresent criminal defendants. Nor, since Gideon, has our highest court specifically addressed \neffectiveness of counsel in the pre-conviction context.  Certainly, the Supreme Court has never \npresumed to tell the Stales what kind of system it must put in place to assure indigent criminal \ndefendants' right to effective assistance of counsel.  What is known about the standard of \neffectiveness, and what must be applied to the significant questions in this case, must be gleaned \nfrom the substantial body of Supreme Court caselaw discussing the Sixth Amendment. \n62 Michigan Chiropractic Council, 475 Mich at 369. \n63 Wesche v Mecosta Co Rd Comln, 480 Mich 75, 83; 746 NW2d 847 (2008); Maiden v \nROZlVOOd, 461  Mich .109, 118; 597 NW2d 817 (1999). \n64 US Const amend VI. \n65 Const 1963, art I, § 20. \n24 \n\n•  • \nThe U. S. Supreme Court has never indicated that the Sixth Amendment's purpose is to \nimprove tbe quality of legal representation, although this guarantee has been found to be \nsynonymous with the right to effective assistance of counsel.67  Nor is it violated by every flaw \nor deficiency in the quality of the legal representation provided.  Rather, a constitutional \nviolation occurs when that legal representation. taken as a whole, is so inadequate as to \n\"undermine the proper functioning of the adversarial process [so] that the trial cannot be relied \non as having produced a just result. ,,68 \nNeither federal nor state law recognizes the right to counsel standing alone-for its own \nsake-but instead, for the effect it has in ensuring that a defendant charged with a crime is \ntreated fairly and the criminal action has produced a fair result.  As the New York Supreme \nCourt noted in Hurrell-Harring, it \"is not, as plaintiffs allege, a general right that can be asserted \nin a civil action to support a claim that seeks to compel other branches of government to allocate \nadditional public resources and intensify administrative oversight\" oflegal representation in \ncriminal prosecutions of indigent defendants. ,,69  Simply put, neither the U.S. Supreme Court nor \nthis Court has ever concluded, or even implied, that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is \nanalyzed any standard other than \"prejudice to the defense\" in the pre-trial, as in the post-trial, \ncontext. \n1.  Prejudice is an essential component of an effective assistance of \ncounsel claim at any stage of litigation. \nSupreme Court precedent unfailingly stresses prejudice as an essential element of a Sixth \nAmendment claim.  For example, in the post-conviction context, the Court in 5rrickland v \n66 Gideon v Wainright, 372 US 335, 344; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963). \n67 Curtis v United States, 511  US 485, 507; 114 S Ct 1732; 128 L Ed 2d 517 (1994); Strickland, \n466 US at 686. \n68 Strickland, 466 US at 686; see also Washington v Hofbauer, 228 F3d 689, 702 (CA 6, 2000); \nGirts v Yanai, 501  F3d 743, 756-757 (CA 6, 2007). \n25 \n\n•  • \nWashington established a two-part test that required not only a showing of ineffective assistance \nbut also a showing that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the \n70 \ndefendant of a fair lrial. Numerous Supreme Court cases underscore the importance of \nprejudice by limiting the situations where prejudice may be assumed in this context.71 \nWe know from Gideon that, standing alone, there is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel \nenforceable against the States; that right is safeguarded against Slale action by the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 72  Therefore, the enforceable constitutional violation is the \nprejudice that altaches at any critical stage from the failure to provide effective assistance of \ncounsel.  Tn other words, it is a prejudice to the process itself.  Accordingly, indigent criminal \ndefendants challenging the pre-conviction effectiveness of counsel must establish prejudice. \nSince the inception of this litigation, Defendants have argued that prejudice is a \nrequirement of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim at any stage of the litigation.  But \nprejudice cannot be divorced from pre-conviction analysis.  Contrary, however, to Plaintiffs and \nthe Court of Appeals majority, Defendants do not argue that this Court must apply the Strickland \ntest to the pre-conviction contest.  As the dissent below points out, neither Gideon nor Strickland \n\"presume(d] to tell the states holV to assure that indigent criminal defendants receive eJTective \nassistance of counsel. ,,73 \n69 Hurrell-Harring, 883 NYS 2d at 352. \n70 Slrickland, 466 US al 700. \nSee e.g., Strickland, 466 US at 692 (discussing actual or constructive denial of the assistance \n71 \nof counsel altogether). \n72 Gideon, 372 US aI341-343. \n73 Duncan, 284 Mich at 357 (Whitbeck, J., dissenting). \n26 \n\n•  • \nWhether this Court adopts Strickland or fashions a different test to fit the pre-conviction \nsetting. if one is even possible before the full outcome is known,74 the plaintiff who raises the \neffective assistance claim must establish prejudice.  Such an approach fulfills the constitutional \nmandate of Gideon while avoiding the very speculation and factually unsupported presumption \nof prejudice upon which Plaintiffs' claims are based.  To divorce the element of prejudice from \nthis claim simply because Plaintiffs raise it in a pre-trial application not only avoids the historic \nanalysis of this constitutional right, but also destroys the limitation recognized by precedent. \nWhile the test to determine prejudice of unconstitutional proportions in the pretrial context has \nnot been fully defined,7s this Court should look to Strickland and its predecessors as recognizing \nthat \"prejudice to the defense\" is the applicable constitutional standard no matter where in the \ncriminal process the denial of effective counsel occurs or is raised.  Further, as with a post-\nconviction denial of ineffective assistance of counsel challenges, the pre-conviction assertion \nmust be analyzed under the specific facts of each case to determine whether prejudice of an \nunconstitutional level exists and invalidates the proceedings.  This approach is also supported by \nthe majority opinions in Hurrell-Harring,16 PIau v Indiana\"  and Kennedy v Carlson,7s and the \n79 \ndissenting opinions in this case and Luckey v Harris (Luckey /f).so \n74  In Strickland. the United States Supreme Court held that the \"proper measure of attorney \nperformance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\" Strickland, \n466 US at 688.  Any standard adopted by this Court for determining pre-conviction prejudice \nwould need to  I) define the level of prejudice that creates a constitutional violation, by setting \nforth an objective reasonableness standard for pre-conviction assistance, with reference to all \ncounsel, appointed and retained; and 2) provide guidance as to how to determine whether \nwidespread, systematic, pervasive deficiency actually caused the prejudice. \n\"  Sirickiand, 466 US at 685-687. \n76 Hurrell-Harring, 883 NYS 2d at 351. \n77 Pia\"  v Indiana, 664 NE2d 357, 363-364 (Ind Ct App 1996), cerl denied, 520 US 1187 (1997)). \n78 Kennedy v Carlson, 544 NW2d 1,6-8 (Minn 1996). \n79 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 380 (Whitbeck, J., dissenting). \n80 Luckey v Harris, 896 F2d 479,480 (CA II, 1989) (Luckey If) (Edmondson, J., dissenting). \n27 \n\n•  • \nThe New York Supreme Court in Hurrell-Harring noted that the plainti ITs challenging \nthat New York's public defense system was systematically deficient had failed to show either \nhow the alleged \"deficiencies\" in the system had resulted in a denial of a defendant's right to \ncounsel in their criminal prosecution or how these \"deficiencies\" had served to affect the \n81 \noutcome of any particular case. In Piau v Indiana, the Indiana Court of Appeals denied a \nmotion by a class of indigent defendants for injunctive relief, recognizing the necessity of \nestablishing prejudice in the pre-conviction process, and reasoning that the plaintiffs' claims ofa \nlikelihood of prejudice were too speculative and that appellate and post-conviction relief \nprovided adequate remedy at law to review Sixth Amendment claims.82  In Kennedy v Carlson, \ntoo, the Minnesota Supreme Court dismissed as non-justiciable a suit by a public defender \nchallenging the statute establishing the funding system for Minnesota's public defenders, \nconcluding that the public defenders' claims of constitutional violations were too speculative and \nhypothetical to support jurisdiction\" because the public defender showed no evidence that his \nclients actually had been prejudiced due to ineffective assistance of counsel. ,,83 \nSimilarly, the Court of Appeals dissent in this case recognized that: \nabsent a showing here that [Plaintiffs'] attorneys' claimed deficiencies \nprejudicially affected their right to receive a fair trial as opposed to merely \nclaiming violation of an abstract right to a particular level of representation, the \nDuncan plaintiffs cannot show that the State has violated their Sixth Amendment \nright to a fair trial. 84 \nLikewise, in Luckey v Harris, pre-conviction indigent defendants alleged deficiencies in \nGeorgia's indigent defense system and asked the court to issue an order requiring the state \n81  Hurrell-Harring, 883 NYS 2d at 351. \n82 Plall v Indiana, 664 NE2d at 363-64. \n83 Kennedy v Carlson, 544 NW2d 1,6-8 (Minn 1996). \nDuncan, 284 Mich App at 380 (Whitbeck, 1., dissenting). \n84 \n28 \n\n•  • \n8s \ndefendants to meet minimum constitutional standards in providing criminal defense services.\nAlthough on appeal the Eleventh Circuit concluded that deficiencies that do not meet the \n\"ineffectiveness standard may nonetheless violate the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the \ndissent in Luckey If properly recognized that: \n[tJhe purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a \ndefendant has the assistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the \nproceeding.  Accordingly, any deficiencies in counsel's perfonnance must be \nprejudicial 10 the defense in order to constitute ineffective assistance under the \nconstitution.86 \nHere, the Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that the prejudice prong of the \nStrickland test is inapplicable to pre-conviction suits, and that justiciability does not equate to \n\"showing widespread instances of deficient performance accompanied by resulting prejudice in \nthe fonn of an unreliable verdict that compromises the right to a fair trial. ,,87 \nWhile the Court of Appeals purported to reject the prejudice component, it plainly \napplied a Strickland analysis by repeatedly referring to both deficient perfonnance (perfonnance \nfalling below a standard of objective reasonableness) and prejudice (depriving the defendant of a \nfair trial)-the two prongs of the Strickand test: \nHere criminal defendants do not sustain harm, for purposes of justiciability \nanalysis and the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, simply \nbecause of their status as indigent defendants with court-appointed counsel \nsubject to prosecutorial proceedings in a system with presumed existing \ndeficiencies.  There needs to be an instance of deficient performance or \ninadequate representaJion~ i.e. 'representation [falling] below an objective \nstandard of reasonableness.,8s \n• • • \nWe further hold that justiciable injury or harm is shown when court-appointed \ncounsel's perfonnance or representation is deficient relative to a critical stage in \n\"  Luckey v Harris, 860 F2d 1012, 10 13 (CA 11. 1988), vacated on other grounds, 967 F2d 673 \nICA II, 1989) . \n• Luckey II, 896 F2d at 480. \n87 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 305. \n88 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 297 (emphasis added) (quoting Strickland, 466 US at 688). \n29 \n\n•  • \nthe proceedings and, absent a showing that it affected the reliability of a verdict, \nthe deficient performance results in a detriment to a criminal defendant that is \nrelevant or meaningful in some fashion.89 \nMoreover, the Court of Appeals alludes to the prejudice requirement, describing Plaintiffs' \nnecessary proofs in this case as a \"monumental\" burden.9Q  It describes this heavy burden: \nWe hold that, in the context of this class action civil suit seeking prospective \nrelief for alleged widespread constitutional violations, injury or harm is shown \nwhen court-appointed counsel's representation falls below an objective standard \nof reasonableness (deficient performance) and results in an unreliable verdict or \nunfair trial, when a criminal defendant is actually or constructively denied the \nassistance of counsel altogether at a critical stage in the proceedings, or when \ncounsel's perfonnance is deficient under circumstances in which prejudice would \nbe presumed in a typical criminal case. We further hold that injury or harm is \nshown when court-appointed counsel's performance or representation is deficient \nrelative to a critical stage in the proceedings and, absent a showing that it affected \n.the reliability of a verdict, the deficient perfonnance results in a detriment to a \ncriminal defendant thai is relevant and meaningful in some fashion, e.g., \nunwarranted pretrial detention. Finally, we hold that, when it is shown that court \nappointed counsel's representation falls below an objective standard of \nreasonableness with respect to a critical stage in the proceedings, there has been \nan invasion ofa legally protected interest and harm occurs. Plaintiffs must \nadditionally show that instances of deficient performance and denial of counsel \nare widespread and systemic and that they are caused by weaknesses and \nproblems in the court-appointed, indigent defense systems employed by the three \ncounties, which are attributable to and ultimately caused by defendants' \nconstitutional failures [internal footnote omitted].  If the aggregate of harm \nreaches such a level as to be pervasive and persistent (widespread and systemic), \nthe case is justiciable and declaratory reliefis appropriate, as well as injunctive \nrehefto preclude future harm and constitutional violations that can reasonably be \ndeemed imminent in light of the existing aggregate ofharm.91 \nWhere this analysis fails, however, is in applying this heavy burden- a burden that essentially \ndistills down to a prejudice standard-only to a proceeding on the merits and not to Plaintiffs' \nclaims as pled. \n89 Dunc:an, 284 Mich App at 302. \n90 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 303. \n91 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 302, 303 (citation omitted). \n30 \n\n•  • \nThe Court of Appeals concludes that Plaintiffs' Complaint has sufficiently alleged facts \nthat, iftTue, establish standing, establish that the case is ripe for adjudication, and that state \nclaims upon which declaratory and injunctive relief can be awarded.92  But the class consists of \nfuture indigent criminal defendants, nOljust the representative Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs have not, nor \ncan they, establish what has not yet occurred.  Nor have they set forth facts sufficient to \ndemonstrate that hann is systematic such that the actions of appointed counsel will lead to an \nunfair outcome. \nWithout explicitly saying so, both the Circuit Court and the Court of Appeals made a \ndetermination that the Duncan Plaintiffs' allegations were sufficient to warrant a presumption of \nprejudice.93  The majority refutes this characterization, but its allowance of Plaintiffs' pre-\nconviction claims on the facts pled requires the presumption that inactions of the State and the \nGovernor have so prejudiced indigent criminal defendants that they have been or will be denied \ntheir constitutional right to effective counsel and a fair trial.  The Court below all but admitted \nthat it presumed prejudice by stating that \"[w]idespread and systemic instances of deficient \nperformance caused by a poorly equipped appointed-counsel system will not cease and be cured \nwith a case-by-case examination of individual criminal appeals, given that prejudice is generally \nrequired and often not established. \n,,<}4 \n2.  Plaintiffs' claims do not amount to a per se violation of the Sixth \nAmendment right to effective assistance. \nPlaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to warrant a presumption of prejudice.95  Such a \npresumption may-as the dissent recognizes-\"avoid[] the conceptually impossible process in a \npre-conviction case of assessing the performance of the indigent criminal defendant's counsel \n92 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 370. \n9J Duncan, 284 Mich App at 361 (Whitbeck J., dissenting). \n94 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 307 (emphasis added). \n31 \n\n•  • \nwhen, for the most part, that perfonnance has yet to occur,\" but it is not supported by Plaintiffs' \nactual claims in this case.

Supreme Court has held that \"[ c ]Iaims of ineffective assistance are generally \nto be resolved through an inquiry into the fairness of a particular prosecution, and not by per se \nrulemaking.,,96 That Court has clearly defined and limited those circumstances where the cost of \nlitigating its effect in a particular case is unjustified and prejudice may be assumed:97  where no \ncounsel has been appointed;98 where counsel is not present for a post-conviction line-up;99 where \nthe right to a pre-trial hearing has been denied;  and where there is joint representation of co-\n100 \ndefendants and conflict of interest is apparent. 101 But the Supreme Court has never assumed \nprejudice and waived the actual prejudice requirement- pre or post-conviction-on grounds \nsuch as those asserted in this case.  In fact, the Court has made clear that apart from \ncircumstances of the magnitude outlined above, \"there is generally no basis for finding a Sixth \nAmendment violation unless the accused can show how specific errors of counsel undennined \nthe reliability of the finding of guilt. \n,,102 \nNeither Gideon nor its progeny guarantees an indigent criminal defendant a particular \nattorney, an attorney who possesses a particular level of skill or experience, or a predetermined \n\"  Duncan, 284 Mich App at 361 (Whitbeck J., dissenting) (citing Strickland, 466 US at 692). \n96 In re Forieilllre Hearing as to Caplin & Dtysdale, Chartered, 837 F2d 637 (CA 4, 1988) \n~citing Cronic, 466 US at 648 & Strickland, 466 US at 668). \n7 Cronic, 466 US at 658 and cases cited therein. \n98 Coleman v Alabama, 399 US 1,7; 90 S Ct 1999; 26 L Ed 387 (1970) (citing Powell v \nAlabama, 287 US 45, 69; 53 S Ct 55; 77 L Ed 158 (1932)); see also Cronic, 466 US at 659. \n99 United States v Wade, 388 US 218; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L Ed 2d 1149 (1967). \n100 See Pugh v Rainwater, 483 F2d 778, 787 (CA 5, 1973), atrd in part, rev'd in part on other \n\\jrounds sub nom Gerstein v Pugh, 420 US 103; 95 S Ct 854; 43 LEd 2d 54 (1975). \n01  United States v Lopez, 548 US 140; 126 S Ct 2557, 2561; 165 L Ed 2d 409 (2006) \n(articulating the right to be represented by counsel free from joint representation of conflicts of \ninterests). \n102 Cronic, 466 US at 659. \n32 \n\n•  • \namount of outside resources to be available to the appointed counsel.

Strickland specifically rejected \"detailed guidelines\" that would encourage \nthe proliferation of ineffectiveness challenges in the post-conviction analysis of prejudice. 105 \nInstead, the Supreme Court has instructed courts to \"presume that the [appointed] lawyer is \ncompetent to provide the guiding hand that defendant needs ... \" 106 and to require that indigent \n107 \ncriminal defendants meet their burden of demonstrating a constitutional violation.\nPlaintiffs ignore this instruction and suggest, instead, that their pre-conviction claims \nchallenging the quality of representation deserve the same treatment as claims alleging the \nabsence of representation.  In their response to Defendants' application, Plaintiffs, citing \nRothgery v Giflejpie County, 108 asserted a pre-conviction Sixth Amendment right to essentially \ndictate the quality of counsel and the investigative resources at counsel's disposal.  But ROlhgely \nlends no support to Plaintiffs' claims since it merely reiterates that the right to counsel (i.e. to \nhave counsel appointed) attaches at the initial appearance before ajudicial officer, whether by \n103 Strickland, 466 US at 688. \n104 Strickland, 466 US at 688-689. \n105 Strickland, 466 US at 688. \n106 Cronic, 466 US at 658 (internal citation omitted). \n107 Cronic, 466 US at 658. \n108 Rothgety v Gillespie COllnty, Texas, _US_; 128  S Ct 2578; 171  L Ed 2d 366 (2008). \n33 \n\n•  • \nway of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.''' 109  Indeed, \ncontrary to already established Supreme Court precedent, 110 the plaintiff in that case was taken \nbefore a magistrate judge, informed of the formal accusation against him, and sent to jail until he \nposted bail, vet was not appointed counsel. I J I  ROlhge,y's refusal to ignore \"prejudice to \ndefendant's pretrial liberty\" refers to the presumed prejudice of the absence of counsel.  Had Mr. \nRothgery been appointed counsel at his first appearance before ajudicial officer- as he should \nhave been- his counsel would have been presumed competent absent a showing of prejudice. \nBut, unlike ROfhgery, where prejudice was presumed because plaintifThad no counsel at all at a \ncritical stage, Plaintiffs here are not alleging that Michigan fails to appoint counsel at the first or \nsubsequent proceedings.  In fact, Rothgery lists Michigan as among the states that \"take the first \nstep toward appointing counsel 'before, at, or just after initial appearance.'\" 112  ROlhgery does not \nestablish a right to a particular level of skill, experience, salary, or investigative resources. \nThe U. S. Supreme Court in Morris v Slappy expressly rejected the very expansive \napproach of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel that Plaintiffs seek here and that was \nrecognized by the Court of Appeals below.1I3  In Morris  the Ninth Circuit had concluded the \nSixth Amendment right to counsel \"would be without substance ifit did not include the right to a \nmeaningful alforney-c1ienl relafionship.\" 114  The Ninth Circuit held the trial judge abused his \ndiscretion and violated this right by denying a motion for a continuance based on the substitution \n109 Rothgery, 128 S Cl al 2583. \n110 Rothge/Y, 128 S Cl al 2584. \nIII Rothgery, 128 S Cl al 2578. \n112 Rothgery, 128 S Cl al 2587 (citing Michigan: see Mich.

Because Plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to establish prejudice, \nthey lack standing, their claims arc not ripe for adjudication, and they \nhave failed to state claims upon which declaratory and injunctive \nrelief may be granted. \na.  Standing \nStanding requires three elements:  (i) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury-in-fact -\nan invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized, and actual or \nMorris, 649 F2d at 718. \nliS \n116 Morris, 461  US at 12 (emphasis added). \nMorris, 461 US at 13-14. \n117 \nlIS Lopez, 548 US at 144. \n119 Hurrell-Harring, 883 NYS 2d at 355. \n35 \n\n•  • \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (ii) there must be a causal connection between the \ninjury and the conduct complained of, i.e., the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged \naction of the defendant rather than the result of the independent action of a party not before the \ncourt; and (iii) it must be likely, not speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \n120 \ndecision.\nPlaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to establish prejudice based on widespread, \nsystematic deficiencies in Michigan's public defender system, as distinguished from their \ngeneralized complaint as to the quality oflegal services offered to indigent criminal defendants. \nTherefore. they have not established the injury-in-fact component of standing.  Plaintiffs' claims \nthat prescnt and future indigent criminal defendants in Michigan will receive ineffective \nassistance of counsel due to the alleged widespread deficiencies in Michigan's indigent defense \nsystem, are too speculative and hypothetical.  Neither have Plaintiffs demonstrated that the \nalleged violation has been caused by the State and the Governor or that their changes will ensure \neffective assistance for indigent criminal defendants at every stage. \nThe Court of Appeals acknowledges that Plaintiffs \"must prove widespread and \nsystematic constitutional violations that are actual or imminent, constituting the harm necessary \n10 establishjusticiability.,,121  But the majority was content to allow Plaintiffs to proceed without \nsufficient facts to demonstrate the necessary harm, causation, and redressibility. Justiciability \ndoctrines exisl for this very purpose- to ensure that lawsuits are appropriate for judicial action. \n120 National Wildlife Federation, 471 Mich at 614-615 (internal quotations omitted). \n36 \n\n•  • \nh.  Ripeness \nFor similar reasons, Plaintiffs' claims are not ripe. Ripeness precludes the adjudication of \nhypothetical or contingent claims prior to actual injury.  An action is not ripe if it rests on \ncontingent future events that may not occur as anticipated or may not occur at all. J22 \nHere, there has been no showing that the State and the Governor caused the alleged \ndeficient performance at the local level.  Again, the majority is content to allow Plaintiffs to \nproceed when their claims do not sufficiently plead facts necessary to establish the alleged harms \nAs the dissent notes, Plaintiffs' Complaint does not allege a single fact that supports their \ngeneralized assertions that the alleged inaction of the State and the Governor has caused the \ndeficient performance that the Duncan plaintiffs outline.  Given that Plaintiffs' complaints are \ncOnlingent upon future events that may never occur, \"the harm asserted has not matured \nsufficiently to warrant judicial intervention.\" 123  Indeed, the actions of appointed counsel may not \nfall below the standard of objective reasonableness, and indigent criminal defendants may not be \nprejudiced by these actions so as to be deprived of a fair trial. \nc.  Plaintiffs' requested declaratory and injunctive relief \nThe rights and legal relations of a party may be declared only when there is an actual \ncontroversy.124 As to injunctive relief, it is an extraordinary remedy that is available only when \nthere is no adequate remedy at law and there exists the danger of irreparable injury that is real \nand imminent. \nThe Court of Appeals concludes that Plaintiffs \"would be entitled to declaratory relief, in \nthe context of this case and assuming establishment of causation, if they can show widespread \n121  Duncan, 284 Mich App at 299. \nm  Michigan Chiropractic Council, 475 Mich at 371, n 14. \n123 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 376 (Whitbeck, 1., dissenting). \n37 \n\n•  • \nand systemic instances of actual harm,,,125  It similarly concludes that since the right to \nprospective injunctive relief is whether the harm sought to be avoided in the future is imminent, \n\"the harm [here] is imminent if plaintiffs can show widespread and systemic instances of actual \nharm that have occurred in the past under the current indigent defense systems being employed \nby the cQunties.,,126 \nAs argued above, there is no actual controversy in this case; therefore, declaratory relief \nis inappropriate.  So, too, is injunctive relief.  First, there is no imminent danger of irreparable \ninjury--only conjectural, hypothetical injury based on some future inaction.  Second, contrary to \nPlaintiffs' assertion (Complaint,  153), they have an adequate remedy at law.  They may raise a \npost.conviction challenge on appeal and through habeas corpus proceedings.  Such post· \nconviction proceedings would resolve many of Plaintiffs' claims and challenges.  Plaintiffs' \nclaims for declaratory and injunctive relief should be denied as a matter of law. \nIII.  The Court of Appeals erred in certifying a class because establishing prejudice and \ncausation based on widespread and systemic deficiencies to Michigan's public \ndefender system will require individual proofs, and because the processes used in \nBerrien, Genesee, and Muskegon counties are dissimilar to one another, further \nrequiring individual examination of each Plaintifrs claim on a case·by·case basis. \nTherefore, no one Plaintiff will serve as an adequate class representative and the \nclass action is an improper method of pursuing these claims. \nA.  Standard of Review \nThis Court reviews the trial court's decision on class certification under the clearly \nerroneous standard. 127  A trial court's findings of fact are clearly erroneous when, although there \nis evidence to support it, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has \n124 MeR 2.605. \n125 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 301. \n126 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 301-302. \n127 Zine v Chlysler Corp, 236 Mich App 261, 270; 600 NW2d 384 (1999)). \n38 \n\n•  • \nbeen made. 128  When evaluating a motion for class certification, a trial court is required to accept \nas true the allegations made in support of the request for certification, without examining the \nmerits of the case. 129  The party requesting certification of the class action bears the burden of \ndemonstrating that the conditions for certification found in MeR 3.501 are satisfied, 130  This \nCourt may refer to federal cases that construe the federal rules concerning class certification.1lI \nB.  Analysis \nClass action is appropriate only when each of the following five requirements is met: \n(a) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(b) there are question of law or fact common to the members of the class that \npredominate over questions affecting only individual members; \n(c) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class; \n(d) the representative parties will fairly and adequately assert and protect the interests of \nthe class; and \n(e) the maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available \nmethods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration of justice. 132 \nClass action is not merely an alternative form of adjudication; it is an exception to the \ngeneral rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of individual named parties only.  For \nthis reason, plaintiffs must meet all the prerequisites for class action set forth under MCL 3.501. \nThis Court in Hemy v Dow Chemical Company recently clarified the proper analysis for \ndetennining whether the prerequisites for class certification have been mel.  This Court:  I) \nI)) \nheld that strict adherence to the class certification requirements is required and that the \naffirmative burden is on the party seeking class certification; 1)4 2) detennined that a certifying \n128 Zine, 236 Mich App at 270. \n129 Henry v Dow Chemical, _  Mich _; 772 NW2d 30 I, 303 (2009). \n130 HelllY v Dow Chemical, 484 Mich 483; 772 NW2d 301, 310 (2009). \nIII Zine v Chrysler Corp, 236 Mich App 261, 287; 600 NW2d 384 (1999) (internal citation \nomitted). \n112 MeR 3.501. \n133 Henry, 772 Mich at 307-31 1. \n134 Henry. 772 Mich at 310. \n39 \n\n•  • \ncourt may not simply accept a party's bare assertion that the prerequisites have been mel, but \nrather, must require that a party seeking class certification \"provide the certifying court with \ninfonnation sufficient to establish that each prerequisite for class certification in MeR \n3.50I(A)(I) is in fact satisfied;\"m and, 3) clarified that the trial court's factual findings are \nreviewed for clear error while decisions within the trial court's discretion are reviewed for abuse \n\"  . \no rdIscretlOn. JJ6 \nPlaintiffs attempt Lo make an end run around Henry by asserting generalized claims that \navoiding the requisite proofs and the requisite prejudice necessary in the pre-conviction context. \nBut these generalized claims do not meet the standard articulated in MCR 3.501A(1) and \nexplained in Henry.  Plaintiffs fail to show that there are sufficient numbers who have suffered \nactual injury; fail to show how-with mere generalized assertions of inaction and without \nexamining countless individual cases- they will prove either the widespread and systemic \nconstitutional violations they allege or that these violations are attributable to the alleged \ndeficiencies in the county indigent defense systems; and fail to allege sufficient facts to give rise \nto a presumption that the proposed class has been prejudiced by the alleged deficiencies.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs have not strictly adhered to even one of the five class certification requirements. \nThe Circuit Court in this case did what this Court said it may not do:  it simply \"rubber-\nstamped\" Plaintiffs' allegations that the class certification prerequisites had been met. 131 \nI.  Numerosity is not mct. \nThe purported class in this case is: \nall indigent adult persons who have been charged with or will be charged with \nfelonies in the District and Circuit Courts of Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon \nCounties and who rely or will rely on the Counties to provide them with defense \nm Henry, 772 Mich at 311. \n136 Hemy, 772 Mich at 307. \n137 See Henry, 772 Mich at 3 J I. \n40 \n\n• \n• \nservices.  The Class includes all indigent adults against whom felony criminal \ncharges will be brought in Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon Counties during the \n138 \npendency of this action.\nAlthough there is no particular minimum number of members necessary to meet the minimum \nrequirement, it is not enough for Plaintiffs to assert the existence of a large number of class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs must \"present some evidence of the number of class members or otherwise \nestablish by reasonable estimate the number of class members.'dJ9  To maintain a lawsuit, the \nPlaintiffs must have suffered an actual injury.  The numerosity requirement is not mct if only a \nportion of the class would have viable claims. \nIn Zine v Chrysler Corp, the plaintiffs alleged that booklets provided to purchasers of \nChrysler vehicles contained misleading information about car buyers' remedies if they received a \n14o \ndefective vehicle. Although the number of class members-582,658- seemingly satisfied the \nminimum evidentiary requirement for establishing the number for a reasonable estimate of class \nmembers, the Court held that plaintiffs did not satisfy the numerosity requirement because each \nclass member muSI have suffered actual injury 10  have standing to sue.141 \nHere, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that all class members have standing to sue, and \nthus, have viable claims.  They have nol alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that appointed \ncounsel assigned to each of these criminal defendants under Michigan's indigent defense system \nwould fall below the objective standard of reasonableness, or that each of these criminal \ndefendants was or will be prejudiced precisely because of the deficiencies of appointed counsel. \nFurther, this potential class is very fluid; since the claims presented here are based on pre-\nconviction activities, representatives and members would come in and out of the class as their \n138 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 330. \n119 Zine, 236 Mich App at 288. \n140 Zine, 236 Mich App at 265. \n41 \n\n•  • \ncriminal prosecutions are completed.  Equally concerning is the fact that class members could \nraise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal in a post-conviction appeal or \nhabeas corpus petition, which could potentially impact this litigation based on a collateral \nestoppel effect.  Additionally, Plaintiffs have not and cannot allege sufficient facts to give rise to \na presumption of prejudice as to all class members.  Because Plaintiffs have not demonstrated \nthat class members have suffered actual injury and thus would have standing to sue, Plaintiffs \nhave no! established a class so sufficiently numerous as to meet the numerosity requirement. \n2.  Plaintiffs' claims require individualized proofs; therefore, the \ncommonality requirement has not been met. \nTo satisfy the commonality, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the issues that apply to the \nclass as a whole predominate over those requiring individual proof.  Thus, at the class \ncertification stage, Plaintiffs must show that the alleged constitutional violations here can be \nproven with common evidence on a class-wide basis.142  \"[AJt a sufficiently abstract level of \ngeneralization, almost any set of claims can be said to display commonality,\" 143 and if this were \nthe extent of the analysis, every class would be certified.  Yet, not every common question \nsuffices because not every common question can be answered with generalized proofs. \nIn Zine, the Court of Appeals held the commonality requirement was not satisfied in a \nclass action involving various statements made by Chrysler Corporation in booklets that \naccompanied new car purchases.'44  The Court recognized that it would have to detennine the \ntype of use for which the car was purchased, how often the vehicle had been taken in for repairs, \n141  Zine, 236 Mich App at 289. \n142 A & M Supply Co v Microsoft Corp, 252 Mich App 580, 582; 654 NW2d 572 (2002); Zine, \n236 Mich App at 289. \n143 Sprague v General Morors Corp, 133 F3d 388, 397 (CA 6, 1998). \n144 Zine, 236 Mich App at 270, 289 n 14. \n42 \n\n•  • \nand whether each class member was aware of the lemon law after reading the booklet. ]45 \nSimilarly. individualized factual and legal issues were held to predominate over common issues \nin Lee v Grand Rapids Board of Education, 146 Tinman v Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 141 and \nEdgcumbe v Cessna Aircraft Co. 148 \nPlaintiffs argue that commonality is met because this case involves systemic \nconstitutional violations and relief would be the same for all class members.  Not so.  Since \nprejudice is an essential element orany Sixth Amendment violation, Plaintiffs' claim that there \nhave been widespread and systematic constitutional violations- like the claims in Zine,  Lee, \nTinman, and Edgcumbe- requires an examination of the circumstances of particular cases. 149  In \nother words, it will require individualized proofs.  It will \"necessarily require the trial court to \nlook at countless cases from each of the three counties to examine whether and how individual \n145 Zine, 236 Mich App at 290. \n146 Lee v Grand Rapids Bd of Ed, 184 Mich App 502, 505-506; 459 NW2d 1 (1989)(holding that \nin a dispute over the Board's sick leave policy, which allegedly treated pregnancy·related \ndisabilities different from other disabilities, individualized factual and legal issues predominated \nover any common issues, including collective bargaining agreement issues, whether plaintiffs \nwere off work because of pregnancy· related disabilities or because they wanted to stay home \nwith their children, or whether plaintiffs were denied use of paid sick leave because their \ndisabilities were caused by pregnancy or because they had previously used up their paid sick \nleave). \n147 Tinman v Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 264 Mich App 546, 563-565; 692 NW2d 58 (2004) \n(reversing the trial court's decision to certify the class where the trial court had held that the \ncommonality requirement had been met by Blue Cross and Blue Shield's alleged systematic \npractice of rejecting emergency claims based on the final diagnosis.

Again, these \nindividual facts must be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine causation- i.e., whether \nthe violations have been and will be caused by the State and the Governor.  As noted by the \ndissent, the Circuit Court will have to \"Jook at untold numbers of individual cases to examine the \ncause for the purported violations.\"m  The majority noted these same varied and case-specific \nproofs, describing Plaintiffs' burden as monumental, yet concluded the requirement was me1.152 \nPlaintiffs hope to rely on generalized harms such as the rate of attorney pay, years of \nexperience, and limitations on the availability of resources to assist the attorney, while avoiding \nhaving to show a connection between rates of pay, experience, or resources and the alleged \ninadequate representation-all of which, when stripped of their \"constitutional veneer,\" assert \nnothing more than a general complaint as to the quality of legal services offered indigent \ncriminal defendants, a claim that generally does not survive judicial scrutiny at any phase of the \ncriminal process.153  As long as there are attorneys providing constitutionally adequate \nrepresentation under the current policies and procedures, based on objectively reasonable \nstandards, the causation element remains unme1.  This wholly defeats Plaintiffs' claims that \ngeneralized proofs predominate.  Indeed, experienced attorneys with vast resources at their \ndisposal can provide representation that falls below the standard of objective reasonableness.

Even the Duncan majority concedes \"this action will \nrequire contemplation of specific instances of deficient performance and instances of the actual \nor constructive denial of counsel.\" 156  Then, inexplicably, the Court concludes that this evidence \nhas no bearing on the particular criminal case or available appellate remedies, but merely \nconstitutes \"a piece in the larger puzzle relative to establishing a basis for prospective, system-\nwide relief.\" 157  This circular logic ignores the fact that this evidence goes to the very heart of \nestablishing the injury-in-fact requirement of each individual class member, causation, and the \navailability of an alternative remedy sufficient to defeat the prospective relief sought. \nEven if a common question exits here-namely, whether deficiencies in Michigan's \npublic defender system are attributable to Defendants- this alone is not sufficient to establish \ncommonality.158  The common question must be answered with common evidence on a class-\nwide basis.  That cannot be achieved here because individual proofs related to each criminal \ndefense, in each criminal case, in each identified county, predominate over generalized proofs. \n153 See Hurrell-Harring, 883 NYS 2d at 351. \n\"4 \nSlrickland, 466 US at 687. \nISS Zine, 236 Mich App at 289. \n156 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 331. \n157 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 331-332. \n,>8 Tinman. 264 Mich App at 563-564; Neal, 225 Mich App at 21. \n45 \n\n•  • \n3.  Plaintiffs have not demonstrated typicality or adequacy because there \narc too many individualized circumstances among the named \nPlaintiffs and the class members, and too many differences among the \nthree named Counties; and because the named counties arc not \nrepresentative of the State's indigent defense system. \nTypicality focuses on whether the claims of named representatives have the same \nessential characteristics as the claims of the class at large. 159  To satisfy this requirement, the \nclaims of the class representatives must arise from the same event, practice, or course of \nconduct.160  Demonstrating the adequacy prong requires that \"the representative parties will \nfairly and adequately assert and protect the interests of the c1ass.,,161  This requires that the class \nrepresentatives be able to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class as a whole. 162 \nThe class representatives here are eight individuals who were arrested at various times in \n2006 and 2007 for a variety of crimes.  Plaintiffs argue these representatives are typical because \nDefendants have abdicated their constitutional responsibilities to every class member by failing \nto ensure that indigent defense counsel have the tools necessary to provide constitutionally \nadequate representation.  But there are too many different factual circumstances relevant to each \nindividual case to show that the Plaintiffs' claims contain a common core ofallegations. \nEach county and court employs its own system for providing cOllnsel, including the \nmethod of selecting and paying for counsel, and requirements and training for counsel, each with \nsome level of review by the State Court Administrative Office (SCAO).  Plaintiffs have not \ndemonstrated that they are typical of the class as a whole.  Indeed, they cannot.  Each county \nuses a ditferent appointed counsel process.

For example, in counties where attorneys are paid by a flat rate, a plaintiff who was \nconvicted of a felony in a relatively straightforward criminal case may not be adequate to \nrepresent a class member convicted of a felony in a morc complex case. \nThe three named Counties are also not uniform in the \"tools\" they use.  Berrien and \nMuskegon Counties, for example. have contracts with local attorneys and pay on a flat rate, \nwhile Genesee County has an assigned counsel system where judges appoint individual lawyers \nto represent indigent criminal defendants.  Furthermore, even within the three Counties there are \ndifferences in the application of these tools to individually convicted felons.  For example, in \nBerrien County, ajudge refuses to appoint counsel if the criminal defendant makes bail; this is \nnot true in the other two Counties.  Therefore, Plaintiffs from Berrien County who do not make \nbail cannot adequately represent class members from Berrien County who do make bail. \nPlaintiffs from Berrien County cannot adequately represent those from Muskegon and Genesee \nCounties. \nSignificantly, the three named Counties are not typical of Michigan's indigent defense \nsystem.  This is problematic to class certification here, where despite attempts to ignore the \nsweeping posture of Plainti ffs' request for relief, Plaintiffs are plainly calling for a centralized, \nstatewide, state-funded system. \nbut the failings in those counties [Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon Counties] and \n•  n ... \nthe types of harms suffered by these Plaintiffs, are by no means limited or unique to the \nthree Counties.

The relevant \nconcern in detennining the convenient administration of justice is whether the issues are so \n163 \ndisparate as to make a class action suit unmanageable. Class action is a superior form of \naction only when it is a morc convenient way than individual suits to decide the legal questions \npresented. 1M  In deciding this factor, the court may consider the practical problems that can arise \n16S \nif the class action is allowed to proceed.\nThe superiority requirement is closely tied to the commonality requirement because class \naction is not a superior form of litigation where a great deal of individualized inquiry will be \nneeded to prove plaintiffs' claims.  Plaintiffs cannot satisfy this requirement because proving \nDefendants' allegations about systematic and deficiencies would require individualized inquiries. \nThe majority impliedly alluded to this unmanageability when it discussed the approach to \nbe taken on remand: \nWhile we leave it to the trial court to determine the parameters of what constitutes \n\"widespread,\" \"systemic,\" or \"pervasive\" constitutional violations or harm, the \ncourt must take into consideration the level or degree of any sho\\lm harm, giving \nmore weight to instances of deficient performance that resulted in unreliable \nverdicts and instances where the right to counsel was denied, with less weight \n163 Dix v American Bankers Life Assurance Co 0/ Florida, 429 Mich 410.419; 415 NW2d 206 \n(1987) (holding that class action was suitable where the alleged misrepresentations involved only \na single type of policy and individual claims differed only slightly); Grigg v Mich Nat'l Bank, \n405 Mich 148, 184; 249 NW2d 290 (1976); Edgcumbe, 171 Mich App at 575. \n164 A & M,  252 Mich App at 601. \n'\"  A & M, 252 Mich App at 601. \n48 \n\n•  • \nbeing given where there is mere deficient performance.  ***  To summarize the \napproach to be taken on remand,  plaintiITs must show the existence of \nwidespread and systemic instances of actual or constructive denial of counsel and \ninstances of deficient performance by counsel, which instances may have varied \nand relevant/evels ofe gregiousness, all causally connected to defendants' \nconduct. Furthermore, because the proofs could be so wide ranging, it would \nreflect poor judgment on our part to set a numerical threshold with respect to the \ncourts determination of whether the instances of harm, if shown, arc sufficiently \n\"widespread and systemic\" as to justify relief. 166 \nAs recognized even by the majority. the proofs here will necessarily have to be varied and \nwide-ranging.  The widespread, systematic deficiencies alleged by Plaintiffs must be \ndemonstrated by a thorough review of literally thousands of specific cases to determine whether \nthere has been deficient performance and actual or constructive denial of counsel, and whether \nthe indigent defendant in those cases was prejudiced such as to constitute a deprivation of the \nconstitutional right to a fair trial.  Such numerous and individualized inquires would be \nunmanageable, and accordingly, class action is not a superior form of adjudication here. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs have not strictly adhered to the requirements for a class action as \nrequired by this Court in Hemy. The Circuit Court's certification of a class in this case was clear \nerror and should be reversed by this Court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons Defendants-Appellants respectfully request that this Court \nreverse the Circuit Court's denial of Defendants' Motion for Summary Disposition under MCR \n2.116(C)(8), and remand this case to the Circuit Court for entry of summary disposition in favor \nof Defendants State of Michigan and Governor Granholm.  Alternatively, Defendants-Appellants \nrespectfully request that jfthis case goes forward, this Court decertify the class. \n166 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 303, 304 (emphasis added). \n49 \n\n•  • \nRespectfully submitted, \nMichael A.

The Separation of Powers argument is ripe for review and supports dismissal of this \ncasco \nPlaintiffs respond to Defendants' Separation of Powers arguments by first raising a \nthreshold argument that the Separation of Powers issue is not ripe for review by this Court. \nThey argue that the question is, at least at this juncture, hypothetical.  Unquestionably, \nconstitutional questions should not be presented anticipatorily, which is exactly why this lawsuit \nshould fail- because Plaintiffs have made a sweeping constitutional challenge out of isolated \nexamples of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel without the requisite showing of injury-in-\nfact.  But based on the way Plaintiffs have postured this case, the Separation of Powers question \nis ripe for review and not just purely advisory. \nPlaintiffs and the Court of Appeals majority claim it is Defendants and the dissenting \njudge in the Court of Appeals who are suggesting a sweeping remedy.  But it is Plaintiffs who \nhave asked for this relief.  Systemic overhaul and the need for additional funding, which would \nrequire an appropriation from the Treasury, are not just speculative-they are the relief \nrequested.  Money is the very essence of Plaintiffs' arguments and their claims for relief, even if \nthey have not expressly requested monetary relief from the State to fund an indigent defense \nprogram.  Plaintiffs argue that \"[cJounties don't have the resources necessary ... They have either \nno resources or insufficient resources to hire outside investigators or experts.  And they often \nlack the skills, experience, and training to handle the case assigned to them.\"  (Pis' Br, p 2). \nPlaintiffs seek better·compensated attorneys with more resources.  Thus, consideration of the \nSeparation of Powers doctrine here is not anticipatory. \nPlaintiffs also accuse Defendants of arguing inconsistently with regard to the separation \nof powers issues, characterizing these arguments as having \"evolved considerably over the course \n\n•  • \nof this case.\" (PIs' Brief, p 8, fn 3).  Specifically, they cite to Defendants' summary disposition \nmotion, in which Defendants argued that \"the changes sought in this lawsuit are best left to the \njudiciary, not individual pre-conviction Plaintiffs.\"  (Pis' App. P 64b).  Plaintiffs completely \nmischaracterize that argument, the nature of which was that the judiciary would have been the \nproper party to bring a lawsuit to seek increased funding to carry out its constitutional \nresponsibilities, because it could use its inherent powers, set forth in 46th Circuit Trial Court v \nCounty o/Crawford,' to compel appropriations from the State Treasury.  (Pis' App, 64b, Defs' \nMtn for SD, p 6).  The position we took in the summary motion is not thaI the court as a decision· \nmaking body or in a judicial capacity is best suited to resolve this, but rather, that the court in its \nrole as administrator of the indigent defense program- through each individual county circuit \nwould be in a better position to seek the necessary funding for adequate operation of its appointed \ncounsel system. Throughout this litigation, Defendants have consistently argued that this case \nviolates the Separation of Powers doctrine. \nOn the merits, the cases cited by Plaintiffs in support of their argument that this Court has \nthe judicial authority to decide constitutional questions miss the mark.  Plaintiffs' Separation of \nPowers argument speaks to the merits of the case.  The cases they cite discuss the actual merits \nof the case and action directly related to the named defendant(s) for constitutional violations \nwithin the defendants' authority to remedy.  In contrast, Defendants' Separation of Powers \nargument is addressing judicial restraints that are jurisdictional in nature and question the very \nability of the Court to proceed given the circumstances presented here. \nPlaintiffs argue that this Court can simply issue declaratory relief.- which fits squarely \nwithin the courts' judicial power to adjudicate constitutional claims-without actually \nappropriating any money from the Treasury or ordering the executive branch to reorganize the \nI 46 Circliit Trial Court v COllnty aJCrawJord, 476 Mich 131; 719 NW2d 553 (2006). \n2 \n\n•  • \nstructure or funding mechanisms for the State's indigent defense system.  There are three \nproblems with this argument.  First, this request for declaratory relief is a thinly veiled request \nfor funding-in other words, funding would not be a mere ancillary effect of a declaration of \nconstitutional rights. Second, Plaintiffs are requesting this Court to establish policy, not to \ndetermine that a program adopted by a particular county is unconstitutional.  Such policy \nconcerns are within the sole purview of the Legislature.  Plaintiffs impennissibly seek to avoid \nthe available and necessary executive and legislative processes to effect a change in the State's \nappointed counsel system, substituting ajudicial solution that compels specific executive and \nlegislative action while removing all discretion and deliberate process from their decision \nmaking.  Third, declaratory relief against the Governor does not resolve this controversy because \nthe Governor cannot provide  the remedy. \nPlaintiffs cite Straus v Governor for the proposition that declaratory relief will nonnally \nsuffice to induce legislative and executive branches to conform to constitutional requirements2 \n(Pis' Brief on Appeal, pp 21-22).  But declaratory relief against the Governor in this case would \nnot result in any resolution of this matter because the Governor cannot address the constitutional \nissue.  It is not within her purview to either define or adopt the policy that would govern the \noperations of the indigent defense program or make the appropriations to fund it.  The challenge \nhere is not to an Executive action, decision, or Order that is within the Governor's purview or \ncontrol, as in Straus.  Any relief after a finding of unconstitutionality in this case would require \nlegislative change and legislative appropriation and, therefore, is within the control of the \nLegislature- which is not a party.  Further, the remedy for any  changes that are local rather than \nsystemic lies with the three exemplar counties- and Plaintiffs have not named them in this \n2 SlrallS v Governor, 459 Mich 526, 532; 592 NW2d 53 (1999). \n3 \n\n•  • \nlawsuit either.  In short, declaratory relief against the Governor cannot solve a constitutional \nproblem where she cannot provide the remedy. \nII.  This case is not justiciable. \nIt is the role of the courts to provide relief to claimants who have suffered or will \n3 \nimminently suffer. Plaintiffs have not met this burden.  They have not supported their \nallegations of injury or imminent injury, as they must.4  Plaintiffs' standing requirements are not \nmet merely because they \"allege\" injury and a causal connection to the State and the Governor. \nPlaintiffs must support these allegations by showing a harm resulting rrom a cognizable right \nunder the due process clause or the Sixth Amendment.  They must also show that this injury is \ndirectly traceable to the unlawful conduct of the State and the Governor.  Finally, they must \nshow that restructuring and increased funding will redress the harm alleged. \nPlaintiffs have never clearly identified what the injury or harm is.  They make general \nassertions that the laundry list of deficiencies they set forth violates due process and the Sixth \nAmendment right to counsel.  But nothing that Plaintiffs have identified in their Complaint or \nthat the Court of Appeals majority cites in its opinion is a violation of the Sixth Amendment \nright to counsel.  If Defendants have no Sixth Amendment obligation to provide particular \ncounselor resources, then the lack of these cannot be a constitutional violation.  The right to \ncounsel articulated in Gideon v Wainwright is the prejudice to the process resulting from the \nfailure to provide reasonably competent counsel at all critical stages. 5  It is this due process \nviolation that is redressable to the State- and is this injury Plaintiffs fail to allege.  Contrary to \nPlaintiffs' argument, neither the Sixth Amendment nor the Supreme Court limits this \nconstitutional injury to the trial and post-trial process:  \"The purpose of the sixth Amendment \n3 Lewis v Casey, 471 Mich 608, 619; 684 NW2d 800 (2004). \nNat'l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs fran Co, 471  Mich 608, 631; 684 NW2d 800 (2004). \n4 \n4 \n\n•  • \nguarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the assistance necessary to justify reliance \non the outcome of the proceeding.  Accordingly, any deficiencies in counsel's performance must \nbe prejudicial to the defense in order to constitute ineffective assistance under the Constitution.,,6 \nBecause Plaintiffs have not alleged such an injury, they have not alleged hann of constitutional \nproportions. \nFurther, the nexus between the alleged harms and acts or omissions by the State and the \nGovernor is missing here.  The actions and omissions Plaintiffs identify as \"harms\" are not just \nassociated with indigent defendants.  These things can and do happen whether counsel is \nappointed or retained.  Other than a plaintiff having been \"wrongly denied counsel or having \nsuffered a deficiency that the United States Supreme Court has recognized as warranting per se \nprejudice, Plaintiffs' allegations of harm are neither unique to indigent defendants nor a violation \nof Sixth Amendment rights.  Based on Plaintiffs' \"proofs,\" it is just as likely that the harm \nPlaintiffs allege was caused either by poor judgment or strategy on the part of specific assigned \ncounsel in specific circumstances.  Assigned counsel may have been experienced, adequately \ncompensated, and had access to adequate resources and still engaged in such conduct. \nDefendants agree that wrongful denial of counsel requires the presumption of prejudice.  Here, \nhowever, none of the named Plaintiffs and putative class representatives have pled any facts \nindicating that they have been wrongly denied counsel.  WhHe the Complaint generally alleges \nthe wrongful denial of counsel as a potential harm, none of the Plaintiffs have suffered such a \nharm, and thus, do not have standing to assert such a claim on behalf of the class. \nThe distinction between the right to counsel at all critical stages and the right to a \nparticular kind of counsel is similar to the distinction in Lewis v Casey between the established \nS Gideon v Wainwright, 372 US 335, 341; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963). \n6 Strickland v Washington, 466 US 686; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984). \n5 \n\n•  • \nright of access to the Courts and the right to a law library.7  Just as an inmate cannot establish \nactual injury by establishing that a law library is subpar in some theoretical sense, Plaintiffs \ncannot establish injury-in-fact by establishing that Michigan's indigent defense system is subpar, \nwhere Gideon does not recognize the right to other than reasonably competent counsel-which \ncan only be detennined on a case-by-case basis. \nrn.  Plaintiffs have not met the requirements for class certification. \nAs this Court recognized in Henry, the purpose of the strictly articulated prerequisites \nwould be defeated if Plaintiffs' only burden is simply to state that it meets the prerequisites and \ns \nsupport that with bare assertions. That is what Plaintiffs do here.  Henry requires information \nsufficient to establish that each prerequisite is satisfied- not just Plaintiffs' unsupported \nallegations or legal conclusions.  Henry encourages courts to look beneath the surface of the \nComplaint, rather than \"rubber stamp[ingJ\" a party's allegations that the prerequisites are met.9 \nPlaintiffs have not come forward with information sufficient to establish that any of \nrequisite class action elements have been met.  Plaintiffs argue that a class action is necessary \nbecause they have no other means of protecting their rights.  But this is not true.  Plaintiffs can \nfile motions to replace deficient counsel, and file post-conviction actions regarding effective \nassistance of counsel.  Moreover, Plaintiffs cannot dispense with the jurisdictional requirement \nof standing simply because a class action is their preferred method of litigating these claims. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that standing to litigate in federal court is not dispensed in \nIO \ngross. As discussed above, Plaintiffs do not have standing because they have not pled facts \nsufficient to demonstrate a violation of their federal constitutional rights that is connected to the \n7 Lewis, 518 US at 351. \n8 Hemy v DolV, _ Mich_; 772 NW2d 301 (2009). \n9 Henry, 772 NW2d at 311. \n10 Lewis, 518 US at 358. \n6 \n\n•  • \naction or inaction of the State or the Govemor- notjust an \"injury.\"  Plaintiffs have offered \nmere speculation and conclusory allegations; these are not sufficient to establish numerosity. \nWith regard to commonality. the absence of money damages does not automatically \nremove the need for individualized proofs.  This case will require individualized proofs to \ndemonstrate both injury and a causal connection to the State and the Governor.  Without these \nindividualized inquires, a court would have to presume what it cannot:  that the deficiencies \noutlined in Plaintiffs' Complaint are sufficiently widespread and that the inadequate \nrepresentation is caused only by the system and not by any other cause. \nIn support of their commonality arguments, Plaintiffs cite Streeter v Sheriff ofC  ook \nCounty.  But that case can be distinguished.  In analyzing whether a challenge to strip searches in \nthe county jail was properly a class action, the court in Streeler found the commonaJity had been \nmet because the conduct toward members of the proposed class was standardized.  The conduct \nwas a strip search of inmates at a particular division in a particular jail during a particular time \nperiod and only following a court appearance.  The case did not involve different jails or \nI I \ndivisions within a jail, or different kinds of searches or search methods. \nSimilarly, with regard to typicality, Plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to support \ntheir alleged common core of allegation that defendants all were or are subject to constitutionally \ninadequate indigent defense because of the inadequate \"tools\" available.  The tools used in the \nthree named counties vary widely and cannot support this common core of allegation.  The result \nof the county-based system is that each county has had a great deal of control over its own \n\"tools.\"  For example, this Court in Records COllrt Bar Ass'n v Wayne Circilit COllrt recognized \n\" Sireeler v Sheriffo  JCook COllnly, 256 FRD 609, 2009 US DiS! LEXIS 29134 at '2-'3 (April \n7,2009). \n7 \n\n•  • \nboth the local and varying character of counties' payment systems for indigent defense,12 \nRecorders Court also recognized the \"potential myriad of local considerations\" that enters into a \nchief judge's detennination of reasonable compensation,\" noting that what constitutes reasonable \ncompensation \"may necessarily vary among the circuits.,,1J  Likewise, the Retired Judges' \nAmicus Curiae Brief in this case acknowledges the current system has \"83 counties delivering \npublic defense in 83 different ways with different levels o/funding.\" (Duncan v State, Amicus \nBrief of Retired Judges Giovan, O'Hair, and Burress, p 3, emphasis added).  Testimony from \njudges at the most recent House Judiciary hearing on pending HB 5676 0[2009, the bill that \nwould create a statewide public defense system, underscored the \"tremendous discrepancy in \nfunding and approach\" to court appointed counsel that has developed within our courts and local \nfunding units, noting that some courts \"do more today than others.,,14  While some range of \nfactual variation will not defeat typicality, the potential for significant variation in compensation, \ncriterion for appointing counsel, and caseloads even among the three named counties defeats the \ntypicality factor.  It also underscores the need for individualized inquiry, which defeats the \nsuperiority factor. \nThe lack ofunifonnity in these \"tools\" also defeats the adequacy factor because Plaintiffs \nare not similarly affected by the alleged unconstitutional policy of the State and the Governor. \nClearly, some counties may have more tools than others or offer better compensation than other \ncounties.  In some counties, Plaintiff class members make bail while others do not- and this is \n12 Recorders Court Bar Ass'n v Wayne Circuit Court, 443 Mich 110, 129; 503 NW2d 885 \n(1993). \nt3 Recorders CalirI Bar Assn, 443 Mich at 129. \n14 See, e.g., the testimony of Tom Boyd, Chief Judge of the 55th District Court for Ingham \nCounty, given at the hearing on HB 5676 held on March 15,2009, at the House Building in \nLansing, available at \nhttp://www.house.mi.gov/comrnitteeinfo.asp?lstcomrnittees-judiciary&submit- Go#CornmitteeT \nestirnony \n8 \n\n•  • \nno trivial difference.  One named Plaintiff, Brian Secrest, even hired a private attorney before his \nMay 4, 2007 sentencing.  Plaintiffs have not established the adequacy of these named Plaintiffs \nto represent the class.  It is beyond argument that a class representative must suffer the same \n. .  h  1  b \n1l1JUry as tee ass mem  ers. IS \nIV.  Plaintiffs' procedural arguments are without merit. \nA.  Defendants have not conceded the facts. \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants have not challenged the substance of the arguments, and \nhave thereby conceded the facts.  But at this stage where Defendants have filed a C(8) motion, \nthey do not have to challenge Plaintiffs' factual assertions.  Defendants have focused on, and \nattacked, the legal sufficiency of Plaintiffs' claims.  Additionally. while the Court must focus on \nthe facts as pled and accept them as true. much of what Plaintiffs'  identify as \"facts\" are nothing \nmore than the ultimate legal conclusions posturing as facts- which neither Defendants nor the \ncourts need accept.  For example, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants must accept as true the \nallegation that the Defendants are responsible for the violations of Plaintiffs' constitutional right \nto counsel and due process of law.  (Plaintiffs' Brief on Appeal, p 10).  But this \"factual\" \nallegation embodies the core legal question whether Plaintiffs have a Sixth Amendment right to \nparticular counsel and resources that the State and Governor have not provided.  The facts \nPlaintiffs do allege are not sufficient to state Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment violation. \nB.  Plaintiffs have not waived arguments as to numerosity or adequacy for \npurposes of class action decertification. \nPlaintiffs also claim that Defendants have waived any arguments as to the numerosity or \nadequacy requirements for class action by not addressing them in their Brie/ in Opposition to \nPlaintiffs' Malian/or Class Certification below.  This argument is meritless, particularly since the \n15 Gen Tel Co oJthe Southwest v Falcon, 457 US 147, 156; 102 S Ct 2364; 72 L Ed 2d 740 \n9 \n\n•  • \nmajority Court of Appeals Opinion addressed all five factors and the dissent discussed the \nnumerosity factor at length.  Therefore, all five factors are within this Court's purview in \nconsidering this application for leave. \nC.  Defendants have not waived arguments pertaining to Plaintiffs' due process \nclaims. \nPlaintiffs also claim Defendants have waived any arguments as to Plaintiffs' due process \nclaims by confining the standing argument to the right to counsel claims raised in this case.  (Pis' \nBrief on Appeal, p 25).  This mischaracterizes Defendants' arguments and demonstrates a \nfundamental lack of understanding about these two interrelated claims.  The Sixth Amendment \nstanding alone is not enforceable against the Stales.  It is only enforceable against the States \nthrough the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.16 \nFrom the beginning of this case, Defendants have argued that the State's current indigent \ndefense system does not violate Sixth Amendment obligations as enforced through the \nFourteenth Amendment's due process clause, because the \"harms\" alleged by Plaintiffs do not \nadversely affect the process.  This is the essence of Plaintiffs' due process claim.  Plaintiffs' due \nprocess and Sixth Amendment claims are not two separate, unrelated causes of action.  Where \nthe State meets its obligations imposed by the Sixth Amendment- i.e., where there has been no \nprejudice to the process-there is no due process violation.  Defendants have consistently argued \nthese issues, from the Circuit Court through the application for leave to appeal. \nRELIEF SOUGHT \nTHEREFORE, Defendants are entitled to the Relief requested in their Brief on Appeal. \n(1982). \nPowell v Alabama, 387 US 45; 53 S Ct 55; 77L Ed 158 (1932); Gideon, 372 US at 341; People \n16 \nv Williams, 470 Mich 634, 641; 683 NW2d 597(2004). \nJO \n\n•  • \nRespectfully submitted, \nMICHAEL A.

CDAM represents the interests of the state's criminal defense bar in a wide array of \nmatters.  CDAM has a strong and direct institutional interest in this litigation because of the \nimplications of this case on the constitutional rights of all Micbigan criminal defendants to the \neffective assistance of counsel for their defense. \nBy its by-laws, CDAM exists to, i\"ter alia, \"promote expertise in the area of criminal \nlaw, constitutional law and procedure and to improve trial, administrative and appellate \nadvocacy\", «provide superior training for persons engaged in criminal defense\", \"educate the \nbench, bar and public of the need for quality and integrity in defense services and \nrepresentation\", and «guard against erosion of the rights and privileges guaranteed by the United \nStates and Michigan Constitutions and laws\".  To further its goals, CDAM conducts two \ndifferent 2lh day training conferences a year for criminal defense attorneys, conducts a 5-day \nTrial College in partnership with the Thomas M. Cooley Law School, provides information to \nthe Michigan legislature regarding contemplated changes of laws, and participates as an amicus \ncuriae in litigation relevant to eDAM's interests. \nAs in this case, CDAM is often invited to file briefs amicus curiae by the Michigan \nappellate courts.  The Michigan Supreme Court has given CDAM permission to file as amicus \nc/lriae without seeking leave of that Court.

CDAM, as amicus, argues that the \nallegations raised by Plaintiffs have been found to exist, in fact, in ten other Michigan counties. \nThe trial court determined the threshold justiciability issues in favor of the Plaintiffs. \nThe majority of the Court of Appeals detennined the threshold justiciability issues in favor of the \nPlaintiffs.  CDAM urges this Court to find that Plaintiff's claims are justiciable in the trial court \nand asks this Court to remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings on the merits. \nCDAM, as amicus, adopts the arguments submitted by Plaintiffs and adopts the \narguments submitted by amici Criminal Law Section of the State Bar of Michigan and amici \nNational Association of Crimina I Defense Attorneys (NACDL). \nARGUMENT \nA.  UNDERLYING CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES \nPlaintiffs assert that the class of persons who are indigent felony defendants in Berrien, \nGenesee, and Muskegon counties have been, and will continue to be, deprived of their \nconstitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel because the State of Michigan has failed \nto ensure they receive such assistance.  Plaintiffs alleged that the failings in the defendant \nCounties and the harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are not limited or unique to the defendant \nCounties but similarly exist throughout the State. (Complaint, ~ll).  While Plaintiffs alleged this \nwhen they filed their Complaint in February 2007, there is now compelling proof that similar \n-1-\n\nfailings and harms do exist throughout the State.  The core legal principles underlying Plaintiffs' \nclaims are not disputed. \n].  THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL GENERALLY \n\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to ... have the assistance \nof counsel for his defence.\" US Canst. Amend VI.  The right to counsel under the Sixth \nAmendment is applicable to the states as a matter of due process.  Gideon v.  Wainwright, 372 US \n335 (1963); People v.  Willioms, 470 Mich 634, 641; 683 NW2d 597 (2004).  Under the \nMichigan Constitution, \"[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right to ... \nhave the assistance of counsel for his or her defense.\"  Canst 1963, Art I, §20.  Since its \ninception as a state, Michigan has entitled its citizens to counsel in felony criminal prosecutions. \nPeople v. Pickells, 446 Mich 298, 311; 521  NW2d 797 (1994). \nThe holding in Gideon v.  Wainwright clearly states that the right to counsel applies to \nthose who lack the financial resources to hire private counsel and the state is obliged to provide \nthem with counsel. \n... in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled \ninto court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a \nfair trial unless counsel is provided for him.  This seems to us to be \nan obvious truth.  Governments, both state and federal, quite \nproperly spend vast sums of money to establish machinery to try \ndefendants accused of crime.  Lawyers to prosecute are \neverywhere deemed essential to protect the public's interest in an \norderly society.  Similarly, there are few defendants cbarged with \ncrime, few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they can get to \nprepare and present their defenses.  That government hires lawyers \nto prosecute and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to \ndefend are the strongest indications of the widespread believe that \nlawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. \n-2-\n\n2.  THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IS THE RIGHT TO THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF \nCOUNSEL. \nThe constitutional right to counsel is more than just the requirement of a person with a \ncard issued by the State Bar of Michigan.  It is the right to the effective assistance of counsel. \nStricklalld v.  Washillgtoll, 466 US 668, 686 (1984); People v. Pickells, 446 Mich 298, 318-319 \n(1994). \nIn Ullited States v.  Cronic, 466 US 648, 654-656 (1984), the Supreme Court explained: \nThe special value of the right to the assistance of counsel explains \nwhy \"[i]t has long been recognized that the right to counsel is the \nright to the effective assistance of counsel.\" The text of the Sixth \nAmendment itself suggests as much.  The Amendment requires not \nmerely the provision of counsel to the accused, but \"Assistance,\" \nwhich is to be \"for his defence.\"  Thus, \"the core purpose of the \ncounsel guarantee was to assure 'Assistance' at trial, when the \naccused was confronted with both the intricacies of the law and the \nadvocacy of the public prosecutor.\" If no actual \"Assistance\" \n\"for\" the accused's \"defence\" is provided, then the constitutional \nguarantee has been violated.  To hold otherwise \"could convert the \nappointment of counsel into a sham and nothing more than a \nformal compliance with the Constitution's requirement that an \naccused be given the assistance of counseL  The Constitution's \nguarantee of assistance of counsel cannot be satisfied by mere \nfonnal appointment.\" \n* * * \n\"The very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is \nthat partisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the \nultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go \nfree.\"  It is that \"very premise\" that underlies and gives meaning to \nthe Sixth Amendment.  It \"is meant to assure fairness in the \nadversary criminal process.\"  Unless the accused receives the \neffective assistance of counsel, \"a serious risk of injustice infects \nthe trial itself.\" \nCroll ie, 466 US at 654-656. \n-3-\n\nor \n3.  THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL EXISTS AT ALL CRITICAL STAGES  THE \nPROCEEDINGS INCLUDI.NG PRETRIAL STAGES. \nThe SiXtll Amendment guarantees the right to counsel beginning at the initiation of \nadversarial criminal proceedings, i.e., the initial appearance ofa defendant in court. Rothgery v. \nGillespie County, Texas, 554 US  , 128 S Ct 2578, 2583; 171 LEd 2d 366 (2008). The right 10 \ncounsel applies to all critical stages of the criminal process for a defendant who faces \nincarceration.  People v. Williams, 470 Mich 634. 641; 683 NW2d 597 (2004), citing Maine v. \nMOllllOlI, 474 US 159, 170 (1985).  A critical stage of the proceedings is any stage where the \nabsence of counsel may harm a defendant's right to a fair trial and includes those preliminary \nproceedings where rights, like bail, are at issue.  In MoullOll, /d., the United States Supreme \nCourt observed: \n[TJhe Court has ... recognized that the assistance of counsel \ncannot be limited to participation in a trial; 10 deprive a persoll of \ncounsel during the period prior to trial may be more damaging \nthan denial ojC OLIIISel during the trial itself.  Recognizing that the \nright to the assistance of counsel is shaped by the need for the \nassistance of counsel, we have found that the right attaches at \nearlier, \"critical\" stages in the criminal justice process \"where the \nresults might well settle the accused's fate and reduce the trial \nitself to a mere fomlality.\"  And, \"[w]hatever else it may mean, the \nright to counsel granted by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments \nmeans at least that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or \nafter the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against \nhim ... \"  This is because, after the initiation of adversary criminal \nproceedings, '''the government has committed itself to prosecute, \nand ... the adverse positions of government and defendant have \nsolidified.  It is then that a defendant finds himself faced with the \nprosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the \nintricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.\"'. [Citations \nomitted; emphasis and initial ellipsis added.] \nClearly, representation by counsel, i.e., effective representation by counsel, is critical to \nprotect Sixth Amendment rights during trial and during pretrial proceedings. \n-4-\n\n4.  THE TEST FOR EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL \nIn People v. Carbin, the Michigan Supreme Court stated the familiar standards for a \nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel: \nTo justify reversal under either the federal or state constitutions, a \nconvicted defendant must satisfy the two-part test articulated by \nthe United States Supreme Court in Strickland v.  Washington, 466 \nUS 668; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 LEd 2d 674 (1984).  See People v. \nPickens, 446 Mich 298, 302-303; 521 NW2d 797 (1994).  \"First, \nthe defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. \nThis requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that \ncounsel was not performing as the 'counsel' guaranteed by the \nSixth Amendment.\"  Strick/al/d, supra at 687.  In so doing, the \ndefendant must overcome a strong presumption that counsel's \nperformance constituted sound trial strategy.  {d. at 690.  \"Second, \nthe defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced \nthe defense.\" !d. at 687.  To demonstrate prejudice, the defendant \nmust show the existence of a reasonable probability that, but for \ncounsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been \ndifferent.  {d. at 694.  \"A reasonable probability is a probability \nsufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"  Id.  Because \nthe defendant bears the burden of demonstrating both deficient \nperfom13nce and prejudice, the defendant necessarily bears the \nburden of establishing the factual predicate for his claim. \nCarbin, 463 Mich 590, 599-600; 623 NW2d 884 (2001). \nThus, counsel's performance is deemed deficient or ineffective when the \"representation \n[falls] below an objective standard ofreasonableness\" and a defendant can demonstrate a \nreasonable probability ofa different result. Strick/al/d, supra at 687-688; People v. Toma, 462 \nMich 281, 302; 613 NW2d 694 (2000). \nB.  THE STATE OF MICHIGAN HAs FAILED TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF \nCOUNSEL IN AT LEAST TEN OTHER COUNTIES. \nThe National Legal Aid & Defender Association (NLADA) spent a year evaluating \ncriminal defense services in ten other Michigan counties.  In June 2008, the NLADA announced \n-5-\n\nits conclusion: \nThe National Legal Aid & Defender Association (NLADA) finds \nthat the State of Michigan fails to provide competent \nrepresentation to those who cannot afford counsel in its criminal \ncourts. \nA RACE TO THE BonOM, Evaluation of Trial Level Indigent Defense Systems in Michigan by \nNLADA, Executive Summary, p. i, June 2008. \n1.  THE NLADA'SEVALUATION IN A NUTSHELL \nThe NLADA evaluation was conducted at the request of the Michigan Legislature \nthrough a concurrent resolution, SCR 39 of2006. The resolution stated that whereas the People \nof Michigan: \nexpect the government to administer a system of justice that is just, \nswift, accountable, and frugal and whereas there is no accounting \nof total indigent defense cases nor complete accounting of \nexpenditures dedicated to public defense services, the rylichigan \nLegislature requests the NLADA, in cooperation with the State Bar \nof Michigan, to issue a report respecting the fairness, cost and \naccountability of the various indigent defense systems throughout \nthe state. \nThe National Legal Aid & Defender Association (NLADA) was selected because it is a \nnational, non-profit association which focuses on providing quality legal representation to people \nof insufficient means.  Established in 1911, NLADA is a leader in the development of national \nstandards for indigent defense functions and systems.  The American Bar Association's Ten \nPrinciples of a Public Defense Delivery System were authored by NLADA officials.  The Ten \nPrinciples are quality standards which ensure the delivery of adequate criminal defense legal \nservices to the poor and allow assessment of efforts to deliver those legal services. \nThe NLADA uses the ABA's Ten Principles ofa Public Defense Delivery System as its \nbenchmark for \"effective and efficient, high quality, ethical, conniet-free representation of \n-6-\n\naccused persons who cannot afford to hire an attorney.,,1  The ABA recommends that \njurisdictions use the Ten Principles to assess the needs of their public defense delivery systems \nand communicate those needs to policymakers: \nThe Principles were created as a practical guide for governmental \nofficials, policymakers, and other parties who are charged with \ncreating and funding new, or improving existing, public defense \ndelivery systems. \nId. \nThe United States Department of Justice has atflrmed the importance of standards as \nessential to the delivery of indigent defense: \nStandards are the key to unifonn quality in all essential \ngovernmental functions.  In the indigent defense area, unifonn \napplication of standards at the state or national level is an \nimportant means of limiting arbitrary disparities in the quality of \nrepresentation based solely on the location in which a prosecution \nis brought.  The quality of justice that an innocent person receives \nshould not vary unpredictably among neighboring counties.  If two \npeople are charged with identical offenses in adjoining \njurisdictions, one should not get a public defender with an annual \ncase load of 700 while the other's has 150; one should not get an \nappointed private lawyer who is paid a quarter of what the other's \nlawyer is paid; one should not be denied resources for a DNA test, \nor an expert or an investigator, while the other gets them; one \nshould not get a lawyer who is properly trained, experienced, and \nsupervised, while the other gets a neophyte. \nU.S. Department of Justice, Report of the National Symposium on Indigent Defense, 2000. \nAt the NLADA 's request, an advisory panel was created by Senator Alan Cropsey, a \nsponsor of SCR 39, to select the representative Michigan counties to be evaluated.  The advisory \npanel included representatives of the State Court Administrator's Office. the Prosecuting \nAmerican Bar Association, Ten Principles of A Public Defense Delivery System, \nI \nFebruary 2002, Introduction. \n-7-\n\nAttorneys Association of Michigan, the State Bar of Michigan, the State Appellate Defender \nOffice,  Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan, and trial court judges.  The advisory panel \nselected ten counties which reflected a broad geographic, population, economic, and defense \ndelivery system sampling.  No one criteria predominated.  The ten counties chosen for the \nevaluation were Alpena, Bay, Chippewa, Grand Traverse, Jackson, Marquette, Oakland, Ottawa, \nShiawassee and Wayne.  After their year long evaluation, the NLADA Report bluntly concluded: \nNLADA finds that none of the public defender services in the \nsample counties are constitutionally adequate. \nA RACE TO THE BOIT.OM: TRJAL LEVEL INDIGENT DEFENSE SYSTEMS IN MICHIGAN, June 2008, \nExecutive Summary, page i. \n2.  THE NLADA REPORT'S FINDINGS MIRRORS THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE \nINSTANT COMPLAINT. \nPlaintiffs allege the indigent defense systems in Berrien, Genesee and Muskegon counties \nhave the following deficiencies: \n(a)  no written client eligibility standards, \n(b)  no merit-based attorney hiring and retention programs, \n(c)  no written attorney perfomlance standards or meaningful system of attorney \nsupervision or monitoring, \n(d)  no guidelines for identifying conflicts of interest, \n(e)  no attorney workload standards, \n(f)  no adequate attorney training, and \n(g)  no independence from the judiciary or the prosecutor. \n1i116-8). \n(Complaint, pp. 3-4, \n-8-\n\nThe NLADA Report identified almost identical defects and deficiencies in the delivery of \nthe right to counsel in many or all of the ten counties studied.  The Report identified: \n(a)  Lack of independence of service providers from the judiciary, lack of workload \ncontrols, and lack of attorney qualifications \n(b)  lack of continuous representation and confidential client communication \n(c)  lack of training and advanced training required by the increasing complexity of \ncriminal law and forensic science and lack of a training requirement \n(d)  lack of supervision over attorney performance \n(e)  failure to ensure prosecution and defense parity \nA review of the existence of the same or similar deficiencies throughout the ten other \ncounties in this Amicus Briefshould lead this Court to conclude that the State's failures are \ndismal, widespread and pervasive. CDAM cites only some ofthe NLADA Report in support of \nthis review. \n3.  THE NLADA REPORT FINDS DEFENSE SERVICES ARE NOT \nINDEPENDENT OFTHE JUDICIARY. \nThe ABA First Principle States: \nThe public defense function, including the selection, funding, and \npayment of defense counsel, is independent.  The public defense \nfunction should be independent from political influence and \nsubject to judicial supervision only in the same manner and to the \nsame extent as retained counsel.  To safeguard independence and \nto promote efficiency and quality of services, a nonpartisan board \nshould oversee defender, assigned counsel, or contract systems. \nRemoving oversight from the judiciary ensures judicial \nindependence from undue political pressures and is an important \nmeans of furthering the independence of public defense.  The \nselection of the chief defender and staff should be made on the \nbasis of merit, and recruitment of attorneys should involve special \nefforts aimed at achieving diversity in attorney staff. \n-9-\n\nThere is a simple reason why defense services must be free of control by judges who now \ndistribute assignments of counsel, set fee schedules, and scrutinize billings and requests for \nservices. As the Report explains: \nHavingjudges maintain a role in the supervision of indigent \ndefense services can create the appearance of partiality - thereby \nundermining confidence in the bedrock principle that every judge \nbe a scrupulously fair arbitrator.  Policy-makers should guarantee \nto the public that critical decisions regarding whether a case should \ngo to trial, whether motions should be filed on a defendant's \nbehalf, or whether certain witnesses should be cross-examined are \nbased solely on the factual merits of the case and not on a public \ndefender's desire to please the judge in order to maintain his job. \nFor these reasons and others, all national standards call for the \nremoval of all undue judicial influence in a right to counsel \ndelivery system ... \nNLADA Report, pp. 35, 38. \nNone of the ten counties studied by NLADA have a defense function independent of the \njudiciary: \nNLADA Report, p. 57 (Bay County): \n[T]he independence of the public defender offices in Bay County \nis continually compromised. \nNLADA Report, p. 60 (Alpena County): \nAlpena County entered into a flat fee contract with ...[ a law \nfinn]. There is no longer any semblance of independence. \nNLADA Report, p. 61 (Grand Traverse County): \nThe lack ofindependcnce is a significant defect in Grand Traverse \nCounty as wei\\.  The delivery systems in both the Circuit Court \nand the district court are administered by the judges. \n-10-\n\nNLADA Report, p. 62 (Oakland County): \nFunding of the defense function in Oakland County is a line item \nin the judicial budget.  Since payment [of defense services] is \nevent based and any increase to the amount paid would require an \nincrease in the defense line item in tbe court's budget, payment of \ndefense counsel is not independent of the judiciary. \nNLADA Report, p. 63 (Shiawassee County): \nA lack of independence also defines Shiawassee County.  Lawyers \nthere are appointed directly by the judge before whom they will \nappear on each assigned case.  Their bills are scrutinized, \napproved, modified, or disapproved in whole or in part by each \njudge personally. \nNLADA Report, p. 64 (Wayne County): \nlndependence of the indigent defense function in Wayne County \ndistrict courts and the Third Circuit Court is also problematic. \nNLADA Report, pp. 65, 68 (Ottawa County): \nOttawa's assigned counsel program is still controlled completely \nby the jUdiciary ... The Ottawa County court culture leads to a lack \nof meaningful advocacy ... [W]e conclude that in Ottawa County \nyou need to play by the judges' rules in order to stay in the game .. \n. Perhaps the most shocking revelation ... was that when \nadditional investigation is needed, the common practice is for \ndefense attomeys to call the prosecuting attorney alld ask him to \nhave law ellforcemelll do it or ill some cases they will call the \nsheriff·directly. \nNLADA Report, pp. 68-69 (Marquette County): \nThe assigned counsel program in Marquette is not independent. \nthe judges can and, especially in the district court, do reduce bills \nsubmitted by counsel.  An attorney's admission to or removal from \nthe [indigent defense] panel is entirely within the judge's \ndiscretion. \n-11-\n\nNLADA Report, p. 69 (Chippewa County): \nThe Public Defender Office in Chippewa suffers a lack of \nindependence of a different variety ... It is well understood that \nsome [Chippewa County] commissioners wish to dissolve the \n[Public Defender] office entirely ...[ T]he chief public defender. .. \ndoes not ask for any budget increases or fees for investigators and \nwould not think of declaring caseload overload.  In return she is \nrewarded by being able to keep her job. \n4.  THE NLADA REpORT FINDS THERE ARE No WRITTEN ATTORNEY \nPERFORMANCE STANDARDS OR MEANINGFUL SYSTEMS OF A lTORNEY \nSUPERVISION OR MONITORING. \nThe ABA Tenth Principle states: \nDefense counsel is supervised and systematically reviewed for \nquality and efficiency according to nationally and locally adopted \nstandards. The defender office (both professional and support \nstaff) should be supervised and periodically evaluated for \ncompetence and efficiency. \nThe NLADA Report states at pp. 80-81: \nAn assessment of attorney supervision against national standards \nserves as an appropriate conclusion of this chapter since, for the \nmost part, what little supervision is occurring is being conducted \nby judges in violation (again) of ABA Principle I.  For example, \nthere are no national or local performance standards adopted by \nGrand Traverse County under which assigned counsel are \nevaluated.  Supervision of assigned counsel is limited to the \ncourt's exercise of its supervisory authority over these attorneys as \nmembers of the bar or to monitoring compliance with the \nprovisions of the district court contract or in the handling of \nindividual cases.  Systematic review for quality and efficiency \ndoes not take place.  Review of attorney perfornlance is done on an \nad hoc basis by the judges to ensure that the attorneys are meeting \nthe judges' expectations. \n• • • \nDefense counsel in Oakland County are not \"supervised\" in any \nfonnal sense.  Some of the circuit court judges who make \nappointments infonnally assess the ability and experience of the \nlawyers they appoint, but there is no formal mechanism for such \n-12-\n\nevaluation.  A similar informal judicial assessment is done in \nShiawassee County. \n• •• \nThe Third Circuit Administrative Order in Wayne County \ngoverning the appointment and removal of assigned counsel \nestablishes an Attorney Review Committee, including the \npresiding judge of the Criminal Division, the executive court \nadministrator and two Criminal Division judges.  This committee \nreviews referrals made by judges regarding attorneys whom they \nbelieve should be considered for removal from the appointment \nlist.  The chief judge said it is unusual for an attorney to be \nremoved from the appointment list, unless it is something of a \n\"grievable nature.\" .. . \n• • • \nWhile some appointed attorneys attempt to and do provide quality \nrepresentation to their clients in Wayne County, there is a \ndisturbing lack of competence and diligence in too many cases -\nnot all of which can be attributed to lack of resources, excessive \ncaseloads, and the 91-day rule ... \nThese ad hoc judicial monitoring systems have a \"fox guarding the henhouse\" quality to \nthem and do nothing to ensure any level of quality indigent services.  Evaluating attorney \nperformance means ensuring that an attorney is capable, competent, and appropriately zealous in \nher advocacy.  A review by a judge to determine whether an attorney is \"meeting the judge's \nexpectations\" may well mean nothing more than that the attorney's billing is low enough to be \napproved.  A lack of zealous advocacy, i.e., not investigating a case or accepting excessive \ncaseloads or pandering to the judge rather than advocating for the client, will not be addressed. \nAttomey performance must have a higher criteria than \"not grievable\" conduct.  Otherwise, the \npublic perception of court-appointed counsel as hacks and slackers  persists.  See: NLADA \nRepo,\", Bay County, pp. 59-60; Grand Traverse County, pp. 61-62; Oakland County, pp. 62-63; \nOttawa County, p. 68. \n-13-\n\n5.  THE NLADA REPORT FINDS THERE IS Lrnu: OR NO PROVISION FOR \nADEQUATE ArrORNEY TRAINING. \nThe ABA Ninth Principle states: \nDefense counsel is provided with and required to attend continuing \nlegal education. Counsel and staff providing defense services \nshould have systematic and comprehensive training appropriate to \ntheir areas of practice and at least equal to that received by \nprosecutors. \nThe NLADA Report states at p. 78: \nIt is difficult, at best, to construct an in-depth analysis of the lack \nof training in Michigan when the bottom line is that there is no \ntraining requirement in virtually every county-based indigent \ndefense system outside of the largest urban centers.  And, even \nthose are inadequate ... \nThe NLADA Report acknowledges that some training is provided by the State Appellate \nDefender Office (SADO) and its Criminal Defense Resource Center (CDRC), in partnership with \nthe amiclis Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan and the Wayne County Circuit Court \nCriminal Advocacy Program.  (NLADA Report, pp. 78-79).  However, the Report notes there is \nlittle or no funding available for assigned counsel to attend this training and such training is \nalmost always at the individual attorney's expense.  (NLADA Report, p. 79).  In most counties, \ntraining is not mandatory and is left to the interest or lack of interest of the individual attorney. \nBecause of this. there is no way to assess, let alone ensure, that assigned counse! is trained or is \nup-Io-date on the law or the sciences underlying forensic evidence. \n6.  THE NLADA REPORT FINDS THERE IS NO MONITORING OF WORKLOADS AND \nNO GUARANTEE OF CONFLICT-FREE REPRESENTATION. \nThe ABA Fifth Principle states: \nDefense counsel's workload is controlled to permit the rendering \nof quality representation.  Counsel's workload, including \n-14-\n\nappointed and other work, should never be so large as to interfere \nwith the rendering of quality representation or lead to the breach of \nethical obligations, and counsel is obligated to decline \nappointments above such levels.  National caseload standards \nshould in no event be exceeded, but the concept of workload (i.e., \ncaseload adjusted by factors such as case complexity, support \nservices, and an attomeys nonrepresentational duties) is a more \naccurate measurement. \nThe NLADA study noted the difficulty in assessing \"caseloads\" because of the \ninconsistent methods of defining a \"case\" throughout the ten counties studied.  (NLADA Report, \np. 58).  Nonetheless, the Report concluded the number of cases handled by the Bay County \nPublic Defender Offices exceeded the national caseload standard for felony representation by 12 \npercent, even without considering the misdemeanor, traffic, and probation violation hearings also \nhandled by the attorneys in the Bay County Offices.  (NLADA Report, p. 59). \nThe Report also noted the difficulty in measuring caseloads in Alpena County which, like \nMuskegon and Berrien counties, awards contracts for defender services.  These contracts are \nawarded to private firms or attomeys for which the criminal defense work is only part of their \npractice.  The Report noted: \"[n]o conclusion can be reached about the reasonableness of their \nappointed caseloads without more information about the percentage of their total time that is \nspent on court-appointed cases and the nature and extent of the private practices.\" Report, p. 61. \nOakland County presents a similar situation.  All of the assigned counsel attomeys in \nOakland County are in private practice.  In the opinion of one Oakland County judge, the \nattorneys assigned to felony cases are overworked and spread too thin as evidenced by their \nfrequent unavailability for scheduled preliminary examinations.2 (NLADA RepOIt, p. 62).  In \n2  This unavailability and resulting delay due to rescheduling has significant \nconsequences for a defendant who cannot post his initial bond.  A bond review hearing \n-15-\n\nShiawassee County, there is also no way to detennine the workload of assigned counselor how \nmuch time an assigned attorney has available for proper representation of an indigent client. \n(NLADA Report, p. 64). \nIn Wayne County, \"there is no limit on how many cases overall an attorney may be \nappointed to in a given year, nor is there any examination of the attorney's entire \nworkloadlcaseload\" of other appointments from other courts and the attorney's private retained \ncriminal and civil representation. (NLADA Report, p.64).  In Wayne County: \nJudges, appointed attorneys, and the prosecutor all reported that \ndefense workloads are very high.  Most of those interviewed \nattributed the workload to the fact that many attorneys try to be \nappointed to as many cases as possible because the fees on each \ncase are so low.  Some lawyers reported that other attorneys are \naccepting too many murder assignments to be able to represent \neach defendant properly.  The heavy workload means that \nattorneys frequently have scheduling conflicts, resulting in \ncontinuances, use of stand-in attorneys, and - in some instances -\nremoval of the attorney and replacement with another appointed \nattorney. \nNLADA Report, p. 65. \nIn Chippewa County. attorney overload is an issue at the two member public defender \noffice.  (NLADA Report, p. 69).  The NLADA study found the offices' caseload was 48% above \nthe national standard for misdemeanors alone. (NLADA Report, p. 69). \nThe connection between workloads and quality representation is an obvious one.  An \nattorney only has so much time to divide between all of her cases.  Some cases require more \ntime.  Some cases require much more time.  All cases require enough time for proper review and \nfrequently occurs at a preliminary examination and often results in a bond modification allowing \nrelease.  The jailed inmate waits a few extra days or an extra week or two for this review if a \npreliminary examination must be adjourned because his assigned counsel is unavailable. \n-16-\n\nassessment.  Some attorneys will take all cases available to them for assignment in the hope that \nthe volume will make up for low pay.  Indigent defendants are entitled to the same level of \nrepresentation as retained clients.  The State must ensure their attorneys are not overloaded -\neven if the attorneys will not make that decision themselves. \nOne judge in Bay County stated prosecutors and defenders were unwilling to take cases \nto trial and be believed defendants would receive better plea offers from the prosecutors if the \ndefenders prepared the cases for trial and were ready for trial.  (NLADA Report, pp. 59-60).  Bay \nCounty was found to have excessive caseloads by every measure.  (NLADA Report, pp. 58-59). \nExcessive workloads prevent attorneys for preparing a case for trial, even as a strategy for \neliciting fairer plea offers based on investigated facts and research on the law. \n7.  THE NLADA REroRtk FINr.f}\\, LACK OF CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION AND \nLACK OF OPPORTUNITY FOR CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEy-CLIENT \nCOMMUNICATION. \nThe ABA Seventh Principle states \nThe same attorney continuously represents the client until \ncompletion of the case.  Often referred to as \"vertical \nrepresentation,\" the same attorney should continuously represent \nthe client from initial assignment through trial and sentencing. \nThe attorney assigned for the direct appeal should represent the \nclient tbroughout the direct appeal. \nThe ABA Fourth Principle states: \nDefense counsel is provided sufficient time and confidential space \nwithin which to meet with the client.  Counsel should interview the \nclient as soon as practicable before the preliminary examination or \nthe trial date.  Counsel should have confidential access to the client \nfor the full exchange of legal, procedural, and factual information \nbetween counsel and client.  To ensure confidential \ncommunications, private meeting space should be available in \njails, prisons, courthouses, and other places where defendant must \nconfer with counsel. \n-17-\n\nThe NLADA Report at pp. 70-71 states: \nIf there is a set of standards that is more frequently met throughout \nthe State of Michigan, it is the standards relating to building an \nattorney-client representation.  Most counties we visited try to \nmaintain the same attorney from assignment to disposition and \nprovide the defendants sufficient space to meet with attorneys. \nHowever, ... undue interference [with attorney-client \ncommunication], high workloads, and the fast pace of dispositions \ncombine to leave little time for infonned discussions to take place. \n\"Vertical representation\" leads to meaningful attorney-client representation, an element \nof effective assistance.  eDAM notes the impact on indigent defense services of this Court's \nCase flow Management Guidelines, which require trial courts to have plans to adjudicate 90% of \nmisdemeanor cases within 63 days of a defendant's first appearance and 90% of all felony cases \nto be adjudicated within 91 days of the bindover from district court.  (Administrative Order \n2003-7).  Although captioned as \"Guidelines,\" the trial courts treat this Order as a mandate. \nThus, judges focus on \"moving the docket\" and attorneys are expected to resolve their cases or \ncase issues at every court appearance.  For this reason, a court appearance for counsel and a \ndefendant must allow for continued vertical representation and confidential attorney-client \ncommunication in the courthouse to maximize the effectiveness of the court appearance in \nensuring that a case is within the easeflow Management Guidelines. \nThe NLADA Report notes problems created by judicial acceptance of \"stand-in\" and \nsubstitute counsel. (NLADA Report, p. 72).  A \"stand-in\" attorney is not the attorney of record \nand usually acts as a placeholder for the assigned attorney.  Problems arise when a particular \ncourt appearance becomes substantive and the stand-in is expected to make decisions without \nknowledge of the case or the client.  The use of \"stand-in\" counsel largely results from excessive \ncaseloads - an attorney can only be in one courtroom at a time and must choose which of several \n-18-\n\nscheduled appearances is that day's priority.  The failure of an overloaded attorney to be at a \nscheduled court date often triggers the sua sponte appointment by the judge of \"substitute\" \ncounsel, often an attorney present in the courtroom with their own client.  Substitute counsel \ndoes not know the case, the case history, or the defendant.  These appointments of substitute \ncounsel are made without consultation with the defendant and, if substitute counsel is expected \nto act that day, are nothing more than a docket management decision. \nThe NLADA Report describes the ability to have confidential discussions with clients at \nmany courthouses as almost impossible.  Because ofa lack of availability of places where \nconfidential discussions can occur for clients on bond, these discussions occur in the courtroom, \nin the public hallways, or outside of the courthouse in full hearing of court personnel, other \nlawyers, other defendants (including co-defendants) and the general public. (NLADA Report: \nWayne County, p. 72; Oakland County, p. 75; Chippewa County, p. 77).  For clients in custody, \nthe lack of facilities and opportunities for confidential discussions in the courthouse are even \nmore onerous and  means discussions of plea offers with a defendant who is \"in the box\", i.e., \nseated in the jury box and chained to 6-7 other defendants and well within the hearing of \ndeputies and other inmates, or held in the \"bullpen\"3, a holding cell behind the courtroom. \n(NLADA Report: Wayne County, p. 72; Grand Traverse County, p. 74; Oakland County, p. 75). \nFor all defendants, the Caseflow Management Guidelines mean decisions are made quickly and \n3 The Wayne County bullpen has been described as \"usually crowded with detainees and \nrequires attorneys and clients to shout the communication.  Attorneys, court personnel, and \nofficers often walk the corridor where the bullpen is located, further diminishing attorney-client \ncommunication.\" Such speech as occurs between the attorney and the client is exchanged \nthrough a small mesh screen in an otherwise solid door and is heard by anyone else in the \nbullpen.  Ullited States v. Marris, 377 F Supp 2d 630, 632, fn. 2 (ED MI, 2005). \n-19-\n\nwith little reflection by a defendant.  The result is, in many cases, injustice. \nCONCLUSION \nThe NLADA Report establishes that Michigan's delivery of indigent defense services is \nas unconstitutional as Plaintiffs allege and more widespread than feared.  For the reasons stated \nabove, this Court should hold that systemic deficiencies exist and their prevalence creates the \nunacceptable risk, and probably the actuality, that indigent defendants throughout Michigan are \nbeing and will be deprived of their constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.  This \nCourt should then allow Plaintiffs cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief to \nproceed. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nGUREWITZ &  RABEN, I'LC \nBy: \nMargar~  ind Raben  (P39243) \nort Street, It th floor \nDetroit, MI 48226 \nDATE: March 29, 2010  (313) 628-4708 \n-20-",

We VACATE our order dated April 30, \n2010.  On reconsideration, leave to appeal  having been granted and the briefs and oral \nargument of the parties having been considered by the Court, we REVERSE the June 11, \n2009 judgment of the Court of Appeals for th e reasons stated in the Court of Appeal s \ndissenting opinion.  The defendants are entitled to summary disposition because, as the \nCourt of Appeals dissenting opinion recognized, the plaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable.  \nAccordingly, we REMAND this case to the Ingham Circuit Court for entry of summary \ndisposition in favor of the defendants.  The motion for stay is DENIED. \n \n  MARKMAN, J. (concurring). \n \n  I concur with the order granting defendant’s motion for reconsideration, vacating \nthis Court’s order of April 30, reversing the Court of Appeals, and remanding to the trial \ncourt for entry of summary disposition in favor  of defendants.  In our prior order, we \naffirmed the result of the Court  of Appeals, asserting that becaus e “[t]his case is at its \nearliest stages and, based solely on the plaintiffs’ pleadings in this case, it is premature to \nmake a decision on the substant ive issues.”   This was error for two  reasons.  First, as \ndefendants observe, this order vacated the  Court of Appeals opinion without articulating \nany governing standards.  Second, it is not  premature to decide this case because the \nprecise issue presented is whether plaintiffs  have stated a claim  on which relief can be \ngranted, and this, as well as the threshold ju sticiability issues, can be determined on the \nface of the complaint.  Defe ndants, in my view, are entitled to summary disposition for \nthe following reasons set forth in the Court of Appeals’ dissent:   \n \n  (1) The U.S. Supreme Court in  Gideon v Wainwright, 372 US 335 (1963), and \nStrickland v Washington, 466 US 668 (1984), “was concerned with results, not process.  \nIt did not presume to tell the states  how to assure that indigent criminal defendants \nreceive effective assistance of counsel.”  284 Mich App 246, 357 (2009). \n \n  (2) Plaintiffs’ claims would have “the  judiciary override the Michigan system of \nlocal control and funding of legal services fo r indigent criminal defendants,” despite th e \nabsence of any constitutional violation.  Id. at 358. \n \n  (3) Plaintiffs’ claims are not sufficient to  create a presumption of either prejudice, \nor prejudice per se, that would warrant either declaratory or injunctive relief.  Id. at 361.    \n \n  (4) Plaintiffs lack standing, and, theref ore, their claims are not justiciable.   Id. at \n371. \n \n \n\n \n3\n \n  (5) Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe for adju dication, and, therefore, their claims are \nnot justiciable.  Id. at 371, 376.  \n \n  (6) Plaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable a nd, therefore, the relief they seek should \nnot be granted.  Id. at 385. \n \n  (7) In finding a justiciable controversy, the Court of A ppeals erred in adopting a \nnumber of assumptions that are conjectural and hypothetical, including assumptions that \nplaintiffs and the class they  purport to represent will be co nvicted of the crimes with  \nwhich they are charged; that such convictions will result from prejudice stemming from \nineffective assistance of counsel; that such in effective assistance will be attributable to \nthe inaction of defendants; and that trial a nd appellate judges will be unable or unwilling \nto afford relief for such violations of the Sixth Amendment.  Id. at 368-370. \n \n  (8) There is no constitutional precedent th at “guarantees an indigent defendant a \nparticular  attorney” or an  “attorney  of a particular le vel  of skill”; that requires a \n“predetermined amount of outside resources be available to an attorney”; or that requires \nthat there be a “meaningful relationship with counsel.”  Id. at 370. \n \n  (9)  The C ourt  of A ppeals  assertions t hat  affording plaintiffs injunctive relief \n“could  potentially entail a cessation of crim inal  prosecutions  against  indigent \ndefendants,” id. at 273, and “tha t nothing in this opinion should be read as foreclosing \nentry of an order granting the type of relie f so vigorously challenged by defendants,” id. \nat 281, accurately describe the potential consequences of its opinion, which consequences \nwould constitute an altogether unwarranted and improper response to plaintiffs’ claims.   \nId. at 380-385. \n \n  (10) The Court of  Appeals has “issued an open invitation to the trial court to \nassume ongoing operational control over t he systems for providing defense counsel to \nindigent criminal defendants in Berrien, Genesee and  Muskegon counties.”  And with \nthat invitation comes a “blank check” on the part of the judiciary to “force sufficient state \nlevel legislative appropriations and e xecutive branch acquiescence” in assuming similar \ncontrol over the systems in every county in this state, while “nullifying the provisions” of \nthe criminal defense act and “superseding th e authority of the S upreme Court and t he \nState Court Administrator.”   Id. at 383-384. \n   \n  For all of these reasons, I agree with the Court of Appeals dissent that defendant’s \nmotion for summary disposition should have been granted.1   \n                         \n1 Specifically, however, I do not agree necessarily with the Court of Appeals dissent that \nour state “has not fully met its obligations” under Gideon and Strickland.  Id. at 398.  It is \nunnecessary to address this issue at this time.  \n \n \n\n \n4\n \n  CORRIGAN and YOUNG, JJ., join the statement of MARKMAN, J. \n \n  KELLY, C.J. (dissenting).   \n \n  The motion for reconsideration should be denied.  It adds nothing new to warrant \nan outcome different from the one correctly reached in this Court’s April 30, 2010 order.  \nThus, there is no basis for this Court’s decision to reverse the Court of Appeals.   \n \n                                         FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n \n  This case involves a class  action suit brought by indigent criminal defendants in  \nBerrien, Genesee, and Muskegon co unties.  Plaintiffs allege th at they, as well as future \nindigent  defendants subject to felony pros ecutions,  are being denied t heir  state and \nfederal constitutional rights to counsel and the  effective assistance of counsel.  Plaintiffs \nallege that these constitutional violations stem directly from the indigent defense systems \ncurrently used in those counties. \n \n  The trial court certified plaintiffs’ claims  as a class action and denied defendants’ \nmotions for summary disposition.  Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal in the Court \nof Appeals, which affirmed the  trial court in a divided opinion. 2  Judge WHITBECK \ndissented and would have granted summary disposition to defendants.  He concluded that \nplaintiffs lacked standing, that their claims we re neither ripe nor justiciable, and that the \nclass had been erroneously certified.3 \n \n  Defendants appealed to this Court, and we granted leave to appeal.4  We heard oral \nargument in April 2010.  O n April 30, 2010,  we issued an order affirming the result \nreached  by the Court of Appeals. 5   The or der  was prem ised  on t he  important \nconsideration that this case is at its earliest  stages.  Given that we must rule solely using \nplaintiffs’ pleadings, it is premature to make a decision on the substantive issues.  Finally, \nour order vacated the trial court’s grant of  class certification and remanded the case to \nthat  court for reconsideration  in  light of our decision in  Henry  v Dow Che mical.6  \nNotably, no justice dissented from that order.  \n                                                                               \n \n2 Duncan v State of Michigan, 284 Mich App 246 (2009). \n \n3 Id. at 371, 376, 380, 388 (WHITBECK, J., dissenting).  \n \n4 Duncan v State of Michigan, 485 Mich 1003 (2009). \n \n5 Duncan v State of Michigan, 486 Mich 906 (2010). \n \n \n \n\n \n5\n \n  Defendants  filed this m otion  for  reconsideration  on May 21, 2010.    In  it, \ndefendants restate the same ar guments from their application for leave to appeal.  Their \nonly new argument criticized our April 30 order as failing to provide proper guidance for \nthe lower court.   \n \n                                                   WHAT HAS CHANGED? \n \n  Our court rules require that in  order to be entitled to relief 7 a litigant seeking \nreconsideration must demonstrate that our pr evious ruling rested on a “ palpable error.” \nYet there is nothing in defendants’ motion for reconsideration of which we were not fully \naware when we issued our previous or der.  What has changed warranting a different \noutcome now?  Defendants complain that this Court’s original order affirms th e result of \nthe  Court  of Appea ls  decision and vacate s  its reasoning without articulating any \ngoverning standards.  However, we were certainly aware when we issued our pre vious \norder  that, by affirming only the result re ached  by the Court of Appeals, we were \nremanding the case without a controlling standard.  \n \n  Indeed, the only arguments proffered in favor of granting reconsideration are a \nrevival of arguments that our previous order rejected.  In their answer, plaintiffs correctly \nnote  that  defendants’ m otion  merely  repeats the arguments   it made earlier and that \ndefendants are effectively asking this Court to issue an advisory opinion.   \n \n                                     PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE JUSTICIABLE \n \n  Regarding the substantive issues in this case, our prior order correctly affirmed the \nresult that the Court of Appeals majority reached.  The concerns about the justiciability of \nplaintiffs’ claims spelled out in Judge W HITBECK’s dissenting opinion and accepted by \nthe majority here are premature.  Virtually all of those concerns relate to the type of relief \nsought by plaintiffs.  The dissent criticized the majority for accepting four “assumptions” \nby allowing the cas e to go forward.8  Yet the dissent failed  to acknowledge that its \n                                                                               \n6 Henry v Dow Chemical, 484 Mich 483 (2009). \n \n7 MCR 2.119(F)(3). \n \n8 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 369-370 (WHITBECK, J., dissenting):   \n \n  For [plaintiffs’] claims to be resolved pre-conviction requires at least \nfour basic assumptions: \n \n \n \n\n \n6\nreasoning rested on four unsupported assumptions of its own:  (1) that plaintiffs would \nprevail  on the merits, (2) that the trial c ourt  would order swee ping  declaratory and \ninjunctive relief beyond the scop e of its authority, (3) that  such relief would necessarily \nentail the judicial branch taking “operational control” of the indigent defense systems in \nthe counties in question, and (4) that if all of the above occurred, proper appellate review \nat that juncture would somehow be inadequate.  \n \n  I find the assumptions of the Court of  Appeals majority less troubling than those \nof the dissent, particularly given that this case  is before us at a very prelim inary stage.  \nThus, I agree with the Court of Appeals majority that “the trial court has jurisdiction and \nauthority  to order de claratory  relief, prohibitory  injunctive relie f,  and som e  level of \nmandatory injunctive relief, the full extent of which we need not presently define.”9   \n \n  At this preliminary stage, plaintiffs’ clai ms adduce facts that  establish that they \nhave standing, and that their claims are ripe.  Also, they state a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted.  Today’s order slams the courthouse door in plaintiffs’ face for no good \nreason.   \n \n                                                              CONCLUSION \n \n  The majority’s decision to grant reconsideration and reverse the Court of Appeals \njudgment  rests on no new inf ormation  and  on no “palpable   error.”  Because I\n                                                                               \n  • That the Duncan plai ntiffs, and the class me mbers they purport to \nrepresent,  will in fact be convicted  of  the crimes with which they are \ncharged or of some lesser offense; \n \n  • That inactions of the state and  the Governor will have caused such \nconvictions; that is, these inactions will have so prejudiced the defense that \nthe Duncan plaintiffs and the class they purport to represent will have been \ndenied their Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial; \n \n  • That the trial courts in the th ree named counties will be unable or \nunwilling to correct such re sults by ordering new tr ials on the basis of a \nfinding of deficient performance and prejudice to the individual defendants; \nand \n \n  •  That it is likely that if the  Duncan  plaintiffs  are grante d  the \npreconviction declaratory and injunctive relief they seek, this will redress \nthe situation for them and for the class they purport to represent.  \n \n9 Duncan, 284 Mich App at 254-255. \n \n \n\n \n7\ncontinue to believe that our order of April 30 correctly rejected defendants’ arguments in \nfavor of its motions for summary disposition, I dissent. \n \n  CAVANAGH and HATHAWAY, JJ., join the statement of KELLY, C.J. \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \nI, Corbin R.

INTRODUCTION \nThe University of Michigan Innocence Clinic (\"Innocence Clinic\") was launched in \nJanuary 2009 by Professors David Moran and Bridget McCormack. The mission of the \nInnocence Clinic is straight-forward and fundamental: to seek the release ofwrongfulJy \nconvicted, innocent persons in the State of Michigan.  As a condition for acceptance by the \nInnocence Clinic, an applicant must complete a detailed questionnaire that sets forth the basis for \nhis or her conviction, the procedural history of the case, and any new evidence that demonstrates \nthe applicant to be actually innocent of the crimes for which he or she was convicted.  The \ninnocence Clinic conducts a detailed review of each application, and accepts on Jy those \napplicants who present compelling cases of actual innocence. \nThe Innocence Clinic has a strong and compelling interest in the issues presented in this \ncase, because the systemic failure by the State of Michigan to provide competent representation \nfor indigent defendants is a primary cause of the wrongful convictions that underlie virtually all \nInnocence Clinic cases.  Unfortunately, by the time a particular case comes before the Innocence \nClinic for review, the record already has been established, the defendant already has been \nconvicted, and the only remedies available to the wrongfully-convicted defendant are the limited \npost-conviction remedies available under Michigan law.  However, as demonstrated through the \nexemplar cases described below, the current system for indigent defense representation in \nMichigan is highly flawed, and the best mechanism for correcting the system is by ensuring that \nthe constitutional rights of indigent defendants are satisfied pre-conviction - not post-conviction. \nJudicial review is not only necessary, it is essential to ensure that one of the most fundamental \nand essential constitutional rights - the right to effective assistance of counscl - is not violated. \nFor that reason, the Innocence Clinic fully supports the relief requested by Plaintiffs-Appellees in \nthis case. \nDETR_1391267.2 \n\n\" \nII,  STATEMENT OF FACTS \nSince its inception in 2009, the Innocence Clinic has discovered and litigated wrongful \nconvictions in the State of Michigan.  The cases accepted by the Innocence Clinic provide \nI \ncompelling evidence that the current system of indigent defense is flawed and should be \nreviewed to ensure its constitutionality.  The participants of the Innocence Clinic have witnessed \nfirsthand - and its clients have experienced firsthand - how constitutionally inadequate \nrepresentation of indigent criminal defendants results in wrongful convictions. \nThe Innocence Clinic accepts cases based on two important criteria: (1) there must exist \nevidence of actual innocence; and (2) there must exist a procedural avenue to pursue a remedy on \nbehalf of the wrongfully convicted person.  Thus far, the Innocence Clinic (which has operated \nfor just over one year) has received 4,000 queries from prisoners; received 2,600 questionnaires \ncompleted by prisoners; reviewed 1,200 of those questionnaires; and further investigated seventy \ncases based on the questionnaires.  The Innocence Clinic has accepted twelve cases to pursue \nremedies for wrongfully convicted people.  Of these, three wrongfully convicted prisoners have \nbeen released and fully exonerated (that is, all charges have been dismissed), while two have \nbeen granted new trials and have been released from prison while the prosecution appeals those \nnew trial grants.  Each of these eases involve compelling new evidence of innocence, including \nevidence that was never found by trial counsel due to either an ineffective investigation, or no \ninvestigation at all. \nWe note that the exemplar cases described in this brief arc not from the same counties at \nI \nissue in the current lawsuit.  However, based on the experience of the Innocence Clinic, we \nbelieve that they are representative samples of the constitutionally inadequate representation of \nindigent defendants that is occurring on a daily basis throughout virtually every county in the \nState of Michigan, and will continue to occur unless and until the current system is overhauled. \nOETR_1391267.2  2 \n\n\" \nThe common thread in all cases undertaken by the Innocence Clinic, as well as the two \nMichigan cases described herein that were undertaken by the Innocence Project associated with \nthe Cardozo School of Law, is constitutionally inadequate counsel in the extreme.  Without an \nappropriate mechanism to review whether the current system of indigent defense representation \nin Michigan satisfies constitutional muster pre-conviction, the remedies available to indigent \ndefendants across the State of Michigan would be limited to the extremely restricted post \nconviction remedies available under Michigan law.  These cases are illustrative of the serious \nflaws in the State of Michigan's current public defender system. \nA.  Karl Vinson \nOn May 14, 1986, Karl Vinson was convicted in Wayne County of criminal sexual \nconduct and breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony for allegedly breaking into the \nbedroom window of nine-year-old Camille Wilson and raping her.  (Am. Mot. For Relief From J. \nI, People v Vinsoll, Wayne County No 86-000214  (Sept. 14,2009), attached as Exhibit A.) \nHe was sentenced to COncurrent sentences of 10-50 years and 5-15 years.  (Id.)  The latter \nsentence was discharged on November 19, 1998.  (Id.)  Mr. Vinson is currently serving the \nremainder of his sentence at G. Robert Cotlon Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan. \nMr. Vinson's case was accepted by the Innocence Clinic after a thorough investigation of \nhis claim of innocence (including biological testing), and its participants are currently working to \nexonerate him.  As with the two exemplar cases detailed below, evidence of constitutionally \ninadequate court-appointed counsel penneates Mr. Vinson's wrongful conviction. \nEarly on the morning of January 3, 1986, nine-year old Camille Wilson was sleeping in \nthe bedroom that she shared with her younger sister when a man broke in through her window \nand raped her.  (Mem. In Supp. Of Am. Mot. For Relief From J at 8, People  Vinson, Wayne \nII \nCounty No 86-000214  (Sept. 14,2009), attached as Exhibit 8.)  Camille said that she had seen \nDETR_1391267.2  3 \n\n.' \nand heard the man before, but could not remember his name when talking with her mother or the \npolice.  (Jd.)  Something Camille had said made her mother, Brenda Wilson, think of Mr. \nVinson, and Camille's mother first suggested Mr. Vinson's name to the police.  Karl Vinson's \nfonner wife, Phyllis, babysat the Wilson children three years before the rape, when Camille was \napproximately six years old, but Camille had not seen Mr. Vinson for three years at the time of \nthe rapc.  (Id.) Based on Camille Wilson's identification of Mr. Vinson, on the afternoon of \nJanuary 3, 1986, Detroit Police Officer Glen Sangmeister went to 20189 Hawthorne St. in \nDetroit and arrested Karl Vinson.  (Id.) \nAt trial, Camille identified Mr. Vinson as the man who attacked her.  On cross \nexamination, however, Camille could not even remember the names or faces of other people she \nhad seen on a regular basis but had not seen recently, including her first grade teacher or her \nSunday school teacher.  (ld.)  In his defense, Mr. Vinson presented multiple witnesses who \ntestified that he was at his mother's home at the time of the crime.  (Id.) \nA mixed blood and semen stain was found at the crime scene on Camille's bed sheet and \nsent to Paula Lytle, a police forensic examiner, for blood type testing, the most common serology \ntest used before DNA testing became widely available.  Ms. Lytic tested Camille and found her \nto be blood type O.  (Jd. at 9.)  Ms. Lytle also tested Camille's saliva for secretor status and \nfound her to be a secretor.  Ms. Lytle explained that a secretor demonstrates his or her blood type \nin other bodily fluids, including saliva, vaginal secretion, and seminal fluid.  Ms. Lytle tested the \nsheet stain and only found blood type O.  (ld.) \nMs. Lytle testified that she tested Mr. Vinson and found that he is an AS non-secretor, \nmeaning his blood type is not present in bodily fluids other than his blood.  Based on her non-\nDETR_1391267.2  4 \n\n.' \nsecretor test, Ms. Lytle testified that the forensic evidence could not exclude Mr. Vinson. (Id. at \n8.) \nOfficer Robert Lloyd, another police forensic examiner, testified that fingerprints were \nnot found at the scene.  He also testified that a \"non-secretor\" is less likely to leave fingerprints \nbecause he perspires less.  (Id. at 9-1 0.)  However, Officer Lloyd was not asked, and did not \nclarify. that by \"non-secretor\" he meant a person who exudes little or no oils on his or her skin \nand that such a non-secretor was not in any way related to the non-secretor test perfonned by Ms. \nLytle.  (Id. at 10.) \nThe purported fact thallhe forensic evidence entered at trial could not exclude Mr. \nVinson, and, according to the prosecution. also narrowed the pool ofpoLentiai suspects to a small \nportion of the population, was an essential element in the overall evidence \"against\" Mr. Vinson. \nAs a result, in closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly returned to the forensic testimony and \nargued that it supported Camille's shaky identification.  (Id. at 9-10.)  The jury even requested to \nreview the forensic evidence during its deliberations because it was so important to the \nprosecution's case.  (Id. at 10). \nFollowing his conviction, Mr. Vinson repeatedly requested DNA testing on the forensic \nevidence, but these requests were denied.  At some point in time, the Detroit Police Department \ndestroyed the samples.  (Id. at 10.) \nNew test results prove that Mr. Vinson is innocent.  Dr. Judith Westrick, a chemistry \nprofessor at Lake Superior State University, obtained blood and saliva samples from Mr. Vinson \nfor testing.  In a report dated February 25, 2009, Dr. Westrick concluded that, contrary to the \ntests perfonned by Ms. Lytle, Mr. Vinson is an AB secretor.  (Ie/.  at 17-18.)  The Michigan \nInnocence Clinic accepted Mr. Vinson's case in February 2009, after being presented with Dr. \nDETR_'391267.2  5 \n\n.' \nWestrick's lab results.  To confinn Dr. Westrick's results, additional semen and saliva samples \nwere collected fTom Mr. Vinson on June 3, 2009.  These samples were sent for testing to Arthur \nYoung, a forensic biologist with NMS labs in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania.  Mr. Young's tests \non both semen and saliva samples confinned that Mr. Vinson is an AB secretor.  (Id. at 18.) \nBoth Mr. Young and Ms. Lytle have confinned by affidavit that Mr. Vinson being an AS \nsecretor means that A and B blood antigens should have been found in the semen stain at the \nscene of the crime, and because they were not Mr. Vinson could not have been responsible for \nthis crimc.  (Id. at 30.) \nAdditionally. expert analysis of the results of the 2009 testing exposed that the original \nforensic evidence itself exonerates Mr. Vinson.  The new evidence indicates that the original \nforensic evidence contained blood type 0 semen, which could not have been contributed by Mr. \nVinson, who is blood type AB.  (Id.)  Therefore, even with the false non-secretor result, the \noriginal forensic evidence should have exonerated Mr. Vinson. \nIn the case ofMr. Vinson, his court-appointed counsel utterly failed to investigate the \nforensic evidence.  His trial counsel failed to seek independent testing of the forensic evidence, \nand therefore did not discover this new evidence which establishes that Mr. Vinson could not \nhave been responsible for the semen left at the scene of the crime. (Id. at 32.)  In addition, Mr. \nVinson's counsel failed to rebut the prosecution's expert testimony.  Trial counsel was \nineffective in her cross-examination of expert witnesses, failing to establish that the forensic \nevidence available at the time of trial should have exculpated Me Vinson. (Jd. at 33.) \nTrial counsel should have invcstigated whether the forensic evidence in fact implicated \nhim as a suspect.  Trial counsel did not arrange to have Me Vinson's secretor status determined \nby its own scientific expert, which would have shown that the result found by Ms. LytIc was \nDETR_1391267.2  6 \n\n.' \nincorrect and that the prosecution's interpretation of the evidence was false.  (Jd. at 32.) \nAdditionally, the rape kit, which was not collected from the hospital to be tested by the police, \nwould have given counsel an additional opportunity to test the evidence against Mr. Vinson, but \ntrial counsel did not make any attempt to obtain the sample or to have any independent testing \nperfonned.  (ld.l \nMr. Vinson's motion to vacate his conviction is currently pending in the Wayne County \nCircuit Court. \nB.  Walter Swift \nWalter Swift was wrongfully convicted in Wayne County ofa rape in 1982 and spenl \ntwenty-six years in prison before he was exonerated and released from Michigan's prison \nsystem.  (Joint Mot. For Relief From J.  I, People v Swift. Wayne County No 82·05965 (May \n14,2008), attached as Exhibit C; Order Granting Relief From J., People v Swift. Wayne County \nNo 82-05965 (May 21,2008), attached as Exhibit D.)  His court-appointed lawyer- who was \nsuspended from practicing law several times in just the last decade based on misconduct and \ninadequate representation in other cases - failed to pursue and present evidence regarding flawed \nwitness identification and exculpatory forensic evidence.  Mr. Swift's case well highlights the \nproblems endemic to Michigan's system for indigent defense counsel. \nIn 1982, a pregnant white woman was the victim ofa home invasion rape-robbery in the \nCity of Detroit.  Despite a wide range of evidence indicating that Mr. Swift did not commit the \ncrime - including a complete alibi accounting for his whereabouts at the time of the crime, \ninfonnation concerning a flawed and unreliable witness identification (never presented at trial), \nand forensic evidence which would have supported Mr. Swift's claim of innocence (never \npresented at trial) - Mr. Swift was convicted of the crimes and served twenty-six years in prison \nbefore being exonerated in 2008.  (/d.) \nDETR_ 1391267.2  7 \n\n,0 \nThe victim in the case provided a description of her attacker to police, and selected from \nhundreds of photos provided to her by police the photos of eight men.  The police officer \ninvestigating the case arbitrarily decided that the eighth person she identified would be included \nin a live lineup for her view - that person was Mr. Swift..  Mr. Swift was added to the lineup \nnOt\\vithstanding that he did not match the victim's previous description of her attacker.  Unlike \nher described attacker, Mr. Swift had an obvious black eye at the time orthe crime (this was not \nmentioned in her description), closely cropped hair (as opposed to the unusual braids and \"poofs \nof hair\" on his head that she had described), and was several years older than her described \nattacker.  (Id. at' 5.)  Nonetheless, he was brought in for a lineup after police told her that the \neighth man she had selectcd would be included in the lineup.  Against this backdrop, she \nidentified him as her attacker.  (Id.)  Even the police officer handling the lineup believed that her \nidentification was not reliable, but the jury nevcr heard this evidence.  Instead, the jury heard \nonly that she had identified him from photos and that she identified him in a lineup. (Id.) \nIn addition, certain forensic evidence would have supported Mr. Swift's claim of \ninnocence at trial if it had ever been presented to the jury - which it was not.  Among other \nthings, an analyst who tested the scmcn from the attacker detcnnined that Mr. Swift could not \nhave been the attacker based on his blood type, assuming the sample tested was predominantly \nfrom the attacker, which was likely. \nMr. Swift's case was accepted by the Innocence Project associated with the Cardozo \nSchool of Law.  Although it was impossible to conduct DNA testing on the crime scene \nevidence, the Innocence Project participants began to uncover infonnation which demonstrated \nthat he had received inadequate defense counsel at trial, including the witness identification \nprocedure and the exculpatory forensic evidence, which never was presented at trial.  (Jd.)  The \nDETR_'391267.2  8 \n\n.' \noriginal prosecuting attorney. police investigator and forensic lab analyst all came forward in \nsupport ofMr. Swift's innocence. (See Joint Mot. For Relief From J., People v Swift, Wayne \nCounty No 82-05965, attached as Exhibit C.)  Based on this new evidence, Mr. Swift ultimately \nwas exonerated in 2008.  (Order Granting Relief From J., People v Swift, Wayne County No 82-\n05965, attached as Exhibit D.) \nC.  Eddie Joe Lloyd \nEddie Joe Lloyd was wrongly convicted in Wayne County of murder, in connection with \na rape, and served seventeen years in prison before he was exonerated and released from \n'1 \nMichigan's prison system in 2002.  (Joint Mot. For Relief From J.  I, People v Eddie Joe Lloyd, \nWayne County No 85·0376 (Aug. 16,2002), attached as Exhibit E; Order Granting Relief From \nJ., People v Eddie Joe Lloyd, Wayne County No 85·0376 (Aug. 26, 2002), attached as Exhibit \nF).  Mr. Lloyd was a mental patient who was persuaded by the police to confess to the crime in \norder to \"smoke out the real killer.\"  Mr. Lloyd's court-appointed lawyer withdrew from the case \n'13, \neight days before trial. (Joint Mot. For Relief From J.  People v Eddie Joe Lloyd, Wayne \nCounty No 85-0376, attached as App. E.)  He reccived $150 for pretrial preparation and \ninvestigation, but perfonned no investigation (he paid a convicted felon $50 to conduct the \ninvestigation, which was never actually performed).  Mr. Lloyd's replacement court-appointed \nlawyer ncver met with his prior lawyer and his trial commenced without delay.  (ld.)  Mr. \nLloyd's trial lawyer did not cross-examine the police officer who was most involved in obtaining \nthe confession which Mr.  Lloyd claimed had been coerced.  He called no defense witnesses at \nall.  He gave a five-minute closing argument.  The jury convicted his client of felony first degree \nmurder in fewer than sixty minutes. \nThe attorney appointed to represent Mr. Lloyd on the appeal of his conviction never met \nwith him and did nol raise any claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  All of Lloyd's \nDETR_1391267.2  9 \n\n.' \nappeals failed.  Ultimately. the Innocence Project (associated with the Cardozo School of Law) \naccepted his case and worked to prove his innocence.  DNA testing continned his innocence, and \nhe was exonerated and released on August 26, 2002, after serving seventeen years in prison for a \ncrime he did not commit.  (Joint Mot. For Relief From J. ~ 7-10, People v Eddie Joe Lloyd, \nWayne County No 85-0376, attached as Exhibit E; Order Granting RcJiefFrom 1., People v \nEddie Joe Lloyd, Wayne County No 85-0376, attached as Exhibit F.)  Two years later, Mr. Lloyd \ndied. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nThe stories of Mr. Vinson, Me Swift, and Mr. Lloyd are not outliers in the State of \nMichigan's system for indigent defendants.  The State of Michigan's system for indigent \nrepresentation is an ineffective system for securing constitutional guarantees to those too poor to \nobtain counsel of their own choosing.  The State of Michigan docs not provide sufficient \nfunding, standards and training, or fiscal and administrative ovcrsight of Michigan's county-\nbased public defense system.  Because of this inadequate funding and oversight, the expcrience \nof the Innocence Clinic is consistent with the allegation of PlaintiffS-Appellees that: \nindigent defense counsel do not meet with clicnts prior to critical \nstages in their criminal proceedings; investigate adequately the \ncharges against their clients or hire investigators who can assist \nwith case preparation and testify at trial; file necessary pre-trial \nmotions; prepare propcrly for court appearances; provide \nmeaningful representation at sentencings; or employ and consult \nwith experts when necessary.  (Complaint at  8). \nBecause of these structural defects, indigcnt defendants across the State of Michigan face \na severe and unacceptable risk of not receiving meaningful and effective assistance of counsel. \nWhen counsel is constitutionally inadequate, overzealous prosecution and law enforcement \nofficials are left free to over-charge defendants and the errors of those state officials who are \nDETR_1391267.2  10 \n\n,. \ndishonest, corrupt, or mistaken go unchecked.  Without question, this systemic constitutionally \ninadequate representation raises the specter of wrongful convictions. \nThe right to effective assistance of counsel is one of the most basic and fundamental \nconstitutional rights afforded to our citizens.  The Sixth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution states that, \"in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to . .. have \nthe assistance of counse! for his defense.\"  In Powell v Alabama, 287 US 45~ S3 S Ct 55; 77 L Ed \n158 (1932), the United States Supreme Court held that the defendants' Fourteenth Amendment \nrights to due process under the law had been violated where they \"were not accorded the right to \ncounsel in any substantial sense.\" The Supreme Court recognized the importance of the pretrial \nwork of counsel, holding that, in Powell, \"during perhaps the most critical period of the \nproceedings against these defendants, that is to say, from the time of their arraignment until the \nbeginning of their trial, when consultation, thorough-going investigation and preparation were \nvitally important, the defendants did not have the aid of counsel in any real sense.\"  Jd. at 58. \nSome thirty years later, in Gideon v Wainright, 372 US 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 \n(1963) the Supreme Court held for the first time that the Sixth Amendment provision for the \neffective assistance of counsel is a fundamental and essential right made obligatory upon states \nby virtue of the Fourteen Amendment due process of law clause.  Justice Hugo Black, writing for \nthe majority, called it \"an obvious truth\" that lawyers in criminal cases are \"necessities not \nluxuries.\" Justice Black further concluded: \nThe right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed \nfundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is \nin ours.  From the very beginning, our state and national \nconstitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and \nsubstantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before \nimpartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before \nthe law.  This noble ideal cannol be realized if the poor man \nDETR_1391267.2  11 \n\n\" \ncharged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to \nassist him. !d. at 344. \nThe right to effective assistance of counsel has been extended to appellate cases (see \nDouglas v California, 372 US 353, 83 S Ct 814; 9 L Ed 2d 81 1 (1963», and more recently, in \nHalbert v Michigan, 546 US 605; 125 S Ct 2582; 162 L Ed 2d 552 (2005), the Supreme Court \nheld that a state may not deny counsel to a defendant who seeks to appeal following entry of a \nguilty pIca.  Finally, the Supreme Court has required that states provide access to experts - such \nas psychiatrists - to an indigent defendant who makes a preliminary showing that his sanity will \nbe an issue at trial.  Ake v Oklahoma, 470 US 68; 87 S Ct 1087; 84 L Ed 2d 53 (1985).  Since \nAke, other courts have invoked the holding in that case to require expert and non-expert \nassistance in meaningful representation for indigent defendants.  See, e.g., Powell v Collins, 332 \nF 3d 376 (CA 6, 2003). \nCriminal defendants are also granted the same fundamental right to effective assistance of \ncounsel under the Michigan Constitution. The language of the Michigan Constitution is virtually \nidentical to that of the Sixth Amendment, providing that, U[i]n every criminal prosccution, the \naccused shall have the right. .. to have the assistance of counsel for his or hcr defcl1se[.]\"  Mich \nConst 1963 Art. 20 § 1.  Accordingly, the Michigan Supreme Court has interpretcd this provision \nas having the same meaning, and imposing the same standard of review, as the Sixth \nAmendment.  See People v Pickells, 446 Mich 298, 317-27; 521 NW2d 797 (1994). \nDespite the looming possibility of wrongful convictions as a result of Michigan's \ninadequate system for indigent representation, the Defendants-Appellants argue that the \nPlaintiffS-Appellees in this case are not entitled to pre-conviction, systemic relief.  Part of the \nDefendants-Appellants' argument rests on the conclusion that the post-conviction remedy \nafforded by Strickland\" Washington, 466 US 668; 104 S Cl 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984), means \nDETR_1391267.2  12 \n\n., \nthe consequences of inadequate representation at the trial level would nonetheless be addressed \nlater. \nThis exclusive reliance on Strickland is misplaced.  Strickland dealt solely with the post \nconviction review of a defendant's conviction.  Id. at 684 (discussing how the issue for review \nwas \"standards by which ... the Constitution requires that a criminal judgment be overturned \nbecause of the actual ineffective assistance of counsel.\").  Strickland's instructions, then, are \nlimited by its tenns to the post-conviction setting: Strickland is concerned with retrospective \nrelief, based on a specific record, and operating under the government interest in finality. See, \ne.g., 466 US at 697 (holding that finality concerns are a variable in the final prejudice standard \noutlined in Strickland).  Strickland has little to do with the prospective relief sought here, when \nthe accused, who are presumed to be innocent, are often hauled into court having had little \ncontact with counsel, who are unable or unwilling to vigilantly defend their clients.  As a result \nof their constitutionally inadequate counsel, indigent defendants in Michigan suffer gross \nconstitutional harms throughout the criminal process, including excessive bail determinations, \nprolonged pre-trial detention, and uncounseled waiver of pretrial hearing rights: none of these \nhanns is remediable in post-conviction review. \nPost-conviction review is insufficient to remedy the widespread and systemic violations \nof the right to counsel before conviction because those who are wrongly convicted as a result of \ncounsel's ineffectiveness often find themselves beyond Strick/and's reach.  First, the wrongly \nconvicted defendant must overcome a strong presumption that his trial attorney was either \nengaged in sound trial strategy or that his trial attorney may have been imperfect, but was not \nineffective.  Strickland, 466 US at 691; People v Mitchell, 454 Mieh 145, 156; 450 NW2d 600 \n(1997).  But this is a presumption that may be at odds with Michigan's system for indigent \nDETR_1391267.2  13 \n\n, \ndefense, in which many attorneys for the indigent are over-worked, under-funded, and rarely \nsubject to appropriate standards for their misconduct.  Second, the wrongly-convicted defendant \nmust establish prejudice - that is, he must show that his attorney's errors contributed to his \nconviction.  Strickland. 466 US at 687; Pickens, 446 Mich at 314.  But the very incompetence \nthat a defendant complains about may also hamper that defendant's ability to show prejudice. \nExculpatory evidence that an effective attorney may have found by the time aftrial, may well \ndisappear when a trial is over: witnesses are lost or become forgetful, evidence degrades, and \navenues of investigation dry up.  An attorney's ineffective decision not to present exculpatory \nevidence at trial may also be called  'trial strategy' on appeal.  See e.g., People  Rockey, 273 \n\\I \nMich App 74, 76-78; 601  NW2d  887 (1999).  Finally, by the time a defendant gets a chance to \nhave effectiveness of his counsel reviewed on appeal, he has lost the presumption ofinnocencc. \nAppellate courts are often weary of considering an attorney's mishandling and misrepresentation \nof evidence at trial- even though an ineffective attorney can so mangle a client's case at trial \nthat the jury will discount the exculpatory evidence presented by the defense. \nIn the short time since its inception, the Innocence Clinic has already seen how bad or \nincompetent lawyers can cause an innocent person to losc months, years, and somctimes decades \nof their lives to prison, just like Me. Vinson.  It is critical that the courts be penniued to protect \nthe essential constitutional rights of our citizens.  As thc Court of Appeals slated in its opinion, \nWe cannot accept the proposition that the constitutional rights of \nour citizens, even those accused of crimes and too poor to afford \ncounsel, are not deserving and worthy of any protection by the \njudiciary in a situation where the executive and legislative \nbranches fail to comply with constitutional mandates and abdicate \ntheir constitutional responsibilities, either intentionally or \nneglectfully.  Ifnot by the courts, then by whom?  Duncan IIStat.e, \n284 Mich App 246, 256; 774 NW2d 89 (2009). \nDETR_1391267.2  14 \n\n\" \nThe Innocence Clinic has a strong and continuing interest in ensuring wrongful \nconvictions are prevented before they occur.  As part of that interest, the Innocence Clinic is \ngreatly interested in ensuring that indigent defendants receive their constitutionally mandated \naccess to effective representation at trial. \nIV,  CONCLUSION \nAs the preceding demonstrates, Michigan's system for indigent defense does not \nguarantee that Michigan's poor will receive the full scope of their right to effective assistance of \ncounseL  Concurrent with its interest in preventing wrongful convictions, the Innocence Clinic \nbelieves that the current system for indigent defense in Michigan should be subject to systemic \nrcfonn by the courts, both to ensure the constitutional rights of all criminal defendants and to \nminimize the risk that innocent defendants are convicted For crimes they did not commit. \nRespectfully submitted, \nOne Detroit Center \n500 Woodward Avenue, Suite 2700 \nDetroit, MI 48226-3489 \n(313)234-7100 \nDavid A, Moran (P45353) \nBridget McConnack (P58537) \nUNIVERSITY 0.'

Moran of the Michigan \nInnocence Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, hereby requests that this court \n\n• \nrelieve Karl Vinson from his judgment of conviction and sentence in this case for the following \nreasons pursuant to MeR 6.500 et seq.: I \nI.  On May 14, 1986, Karl Vinson was convicted at a jury trial in the third judicial circuit \ncourt presided over by Hon. Vera Massey Jones.  Mr. Vinson was convicted of criminal \nsexual conduct (eSC 1) and breaking & entering with intent to commit a felony (B&E) \nfor allegedly breaking into the bedroom window of oine-year-old Camille Wilson and \nraping her.  On May 29, 1986, Mr. Vinson was sentenced to concurrent sentences of J 0-\n50 years and 5-15 years.  The latter sentence was discharged on November 19, 1998. Mr. \nVinson is currently serving the remainder of his sentence at O. Robert Conon \nCorrectional Facility in Jackson, Michigan. \n2.  Mr. Vinson, through his appellate counsel, appealed his conviction as of right to the \nMichigan Court of Appeals, raising a claim of prosecutorial misconduct.  The Michigan \nCourt of Appeals affirmed Mr. Vinson's conviction on October 25, 1988 (Appeals Case \nNumber: 00-006682-AP).  On June 27,1989, the Michigan Supreme Court denied Mr. \nVinson's request for leave to appeal (Michigan Supreme Court Case Nwnber: 84710). \nOn October 10,2000, Mr. Vinson filed, in pro per, a Motion for Relief from Judgment \nraising claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.  This motion was \ndenied on March 5, 2001 (Case Number: 86-000214).  Mr. Vinson again filed a Motion \nfor Relief from Judgment in 2006, but was again denied on January 23, 2006 (Case \nNumber: 86-0214).  Mr. Vinson did not appeal these adverse rulings.  On February II, \n2006, Mr. Vinson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District \n1 Defendant does not request appointment of counsel. \n2 \n\n• \nCourt for the Eastern District of Michigan raising claims of ineffective assistance of trial \nand appellate counsel, among others (Case Number: 06-10850-BC).  The court granted a \nmotion for summary judgment seeking dismissal because the motion was filed outside of \nthe one-year limitations period and Mr. Vinson had not established an entitlement to \nequitable tolling of that period.  Mr. Vinson did not appeal. \n3.  Josephine Chapman represented Mr. Vinson during his trial and sentencing. Gerald M. \nLorence represented Mr. Vinson for his direct appeal.  Mr. Vinson filed the application \nfor leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, the Motion for Relief from Judgment, \nand the federal habeas corpus petition in pro per.  The Cooley Law School Innocence \nProject worked with Mr. Vinson beginning in 200 I in order to help locate samples for \nforensic testing, but was unable to locate any remaining forensic evidence. \n4.  Mr. Vinson has maintained his innocence since his arrest.  Since his conviction, he has \nrepeatedly tried to locate the forensic evidence collected by the police in order to have \nDNA testing done.  The Michigan lJUlocence Clinic accepted Mr. Vinson's case in \nFebruary 2009 as one of the Clinic's first cases after a thorough investigation ofMr. \nVinson's claim of innocence, including biological testing. \n5.  New testing perfonned in 2009 reveals that the original forensic test result conducted by \nthe Detroit Police Crime Lab in 1986 indicating that Mr. Vinson was a non-secretor was \nincorrect and that he is, in fact, a secretor.  The new test results prove that it is \nscientifically impossible for Mr. Vinson to have been responsible for this crime. \n6.  The newly discovered forensic evidence that Mr, Vinson is a blood type AB secretor has \nnot been previously presented to this court because the collection and laboratory analysis \n3 \n\n• \nafMr. Vinson's bodily fluids only occurred in February and June of this year, 2009, and \nthe results were only recently obtained by Mr. Vinson's new counsel.  This evidence was \nnot previously discoverable.  As a result, Mr. Vinson's successive Motion for Relief from \nJudgment is proper under MeR 6.502(G)(2).  Mr. Vinson's successive Motion for Relief \nfrom ludgment is also proper under MeR 6.508(D) because this new evidence proves \nthat Mr. Vinson is innocent of this crime.  As a result of this new evidence, Mr. Vinson \nrequests relief from his judgment of conviction or a hearing to evaluate the issues raised \nin this motion. \n7.  In addition, analysis of the results of the 2009 testing exposed that the original forensic \nevidence itself also exonerates Mr. Vinson.  The new evidence indicates that the original \nforensic evidence contained blood type 0 semen, which could not have been contributed \nby Mr. Vinson, who is blood type AB.  This evidence has not been presented to this court \nbecause this evidence was only discovered when independent experts tested Mr. Vinson's \nsecretor status.  The collection and laboratory analysis of Mr. Vinson's bodily fluids only \noccurred in February and June of this year, 2009, and the results were only recently \nobtained by Mr. Vinson's new counsel.  This new evidence was only discovered during \nthe analysis of the results from this independent testing. and therefore was not previously \ndiscoverable.  As a result, Mr. Vinson's successive motion for relief from judgment is \nproper under MCR 6.502(G)(2).  Mr. Vinson's successive Motion for Relief from \nJudgment is also proper under MCR 6.508(D) because this new evidence shows that Mr. \nVinson is innocent of this crime.  As a result of this new evidence, Mr. Vinson requests \nrelief from his judgment of conviction or a hearing to evaluate the issues raised in this \nmotion. \n4 \n\n• \n8.  Mr. Vinson also requests relief based on two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. \nFirst, both his trial and appellate counsel failed to seek independent testing of the forensic \nevidence, and therefore did not discover this new evidence which establishes that Mr. \nVinson could not have been responsible for the semen left at the scene of the crime. \nSecond, trial counsel was ineffective in her cross examination of expert witnesses which \nwould have shown that the forensic evidence available at the time of trial should have \nexculpated Mr. Vinson.  Appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to litigate this \nineffective assistance of trial counsel. \n9.  Mr. Vinson also requests relief based on prosecutorial misconduct.  The prosecutor \nstrongly relied on forensic evidence at trial.  First, the prosecutor falsely claimed that the \noriginal forensic evidence supported Mr. Vinson's guilt, when the evidence should have \ncleared Mr. Vinson of involvement.  Second, to bolster the case against Mr. Vinson, the \nprosecutor misrepresented the forensic evidence to falsely include Mr. Vinson in a small \nclass of individuals who could have committed the crime.  Third, the prosecutor \nimproperly linked the forensic evidence of Mr. Vinson's secretor status to the lack of \nforensic fingerprint evidence, claiming that the lack of fingerprint evidence further \nsupported Mr. Vinson's guilt.  The prosecutor's misrepresentation of forensic evidence \ncompromised the fairness ofMr. Vinson's trial, violating Mr. Vinson's constitutional \nright to due process and thus requiring relief from judgment of conviction. \n10. None of these issues have been raised before because trial and appellate counsel were \nineffective.  As a result of the ineffectiveness of both trial and appellate counsel, Mr. \nVinson has been unable to present the newly discovered evidence that conclusively rebuts \n5 \n\n• \nthe prosecution's link between Mr. Vinson and the forensic evidence collected at the \ncnme scene. \nWherefore, this Court should relieve Karl Vinson from his judgment of conviction, or hold a \nhearing to evaluate the issues raised in this motion. \nDated: September 14, 2009  Respectfully Submitted, \nMICHIGAN lNN~.eO} IC \n----?Ja\"  'NI 0  ~ ' \n.\\ CU  A.lrQcfY\\c...  ....,.... \nBridget Mkonnafk (P58537)  \\\"  , Moran (P45353) \nAttorney for Defendant  ey for Defendant \nSQ\\Q.,_~O_ n<:D9--jS\":\"\"  ~o,cC};;' , ~ T\\G-~~_;,--\\--- \\ ~ \nSolana Flora  1  Jacquel  e Harrington  I,) \nStudent Attorney for Defendant  Student Attorney for Defendant \nE\"'9=~ It ~ b\";'~  ~~L;!;. ~J~----C.J \\.-~, \nJ \nces Kim  I \nStudent Attorney for Defendant  Student Attorney for Defendant \nir \nG-'-~. o=~ \nErin Opperma  Chad Ray \nStudent Attorney for Defendant  Student Attorney for Defendant \n6 \n\n• \nEXHIBIT B \n\n• \nSTATE OF MICHIGAN \nIN THE THIRD JUDICIAL CIRCUIT COURT CRIMINAL DIVISION \nCOUNTY OF WAYNE \nPEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, \nPlaintiff,  Case No. 86-000214 \nHon.

State Street \nAnn Arbor, MI 48109-1215 \n(734) 763-9353 \nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF AMENDED MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM \nJUDGMENT \nKarl Vinson has already served 23 years for a rape that he did not conunit.  Now there is \nconclusive, scientific evidence of his innocence that requires relief from his judgment of \n7 \n\nconviction.  At trial, the prosecution presented two pieces of evidence linking Mr. Vinson to the \ncrime,  First, the prosecution presented the eyewitness testimony of the nine-year old victim, \nwho could not identify Mr. Vinson until her mother suggested his name to her.  The victim's \ntestimony further contradicted several alibi witnesses for Mr. Vinson,  Second, the prosecutor \nheavily relied on forensic evidence \"against\" Mr. Vinson based on a mixed blood and semen \nstain left on the victim's sheet by her attacker.  It has now been demonstrated that the forensic \ntesting ofMr, Vinson was false, and that the original forensic evidence should have eliminated \nMr. Vinson as a suspect even with the false result.  Because Mr, Vinson does not match the \nforensic evidence left at the scene of the crime, he could not have been responsible for this \ncnme. \n1.  Facts and Procedural History \nEarly on the morning of January 3, 1986, nine-year old Camille Wilson was sleeping in her \nbedroom that she shared with her younger sister at Goddard Rd. in Detroit when a man broke in \nthrough her window and raped her. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 18:4-25,25:6-24, May 13, 1986; Trial Tr. \nVol. 1, 218: 1-18, May 12, 1986.)  On the afternoon of January 3, 1986, Detroit Police Officer \nGlen Sangmeister went to 20189 Hawthorne S1. in Dettoit and arrested Karl Vinson. (Trial Tr. \nVol. 2, 42:9-20.) \nAt that time, Camille said that she had seen and heard the man before, but could not \nremember his name when talking with her mother or the police. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 36:8-13.) \nSomething Camille said made her mother, Brenda Wilson, think of Mr. Vinson, and Camille's \nmother first suggested Mr, Vinson's name to the police,  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 227: 12·25; Trial Tr. \nVol. 2, 237:25-238:4.)  Karl Vinson's fanner wife, Phyllis, babysat the Wilson children three \nyears before the rape, when Camille was approximately six years old, (Trial Ir. Vol. 2,220:24-\n8 \n\n• \n22 I :6), but Camille had not seen Mr. Vinson for three years at the time of the rape (Trial TT. Vol. \n1,233:4-6). \nAt trial, Camille identified Mr. Vinson as the man who attacked her. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 28:2-\n13.)  On cross-examination, Camille could not remember the names or faces of other people she \nhad seen on a regular basis but had not seen recently, including her first grade teacher or her \nSunday school teacher. (rrial Tr. Vol. 2, 31: 14-25,32:6-24, 33: 1-3.)  In his defense, Mr. Vinson \npresented multiple witnesses who testified that he was at his mother's home at the lime of the \ncrime. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 93:1-3, 109:11-15.) \nA mixed blood and semen stain was found at the crime scene on Camille's bed sheet and sent \nto Paula Lytle, a police forensic examiner, for blood type testing, the most common serology test \nused before DNA testing became widely available.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 68: 16-25.)  Ms. Lytle tested \nCamille and found her to be blood type O.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 75:23-25.)  Ms. Lytle also tested \nCamille's saliva for secretor status and found her to be a secretor.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2,75:25,76:8-\n9.)  Ms. Lytle explained that a secretor demonstrates his or her blood type in other bodily fluids, \nincluding saliva, vaginal secretion, and seminal fluid.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 76:3-16.)  Ms. Lytle \ntested the sheet stain and only found blood type O.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 78:4-13.) \nMs. Lytle testified that she tested Mr. Vinson and found that he is an AB non-secretor, \nmeaning his blood type is not present in bodily fluids other than his blood.  (See Exhibit A, Lytle \n& Badaczewski Laboratory Analysis, indicating result that Mr. Vinson is an AB non-secretor; \nTrial Tr. Vol. 2. 77:2-24.)  Based on her non-secretor test, Ms. Lytle testified that the forensic \nevidence could not exclude Mr. Vinson. (Trial Tr. VoL 2, 78: 14-24.) \nOfficer Robert Lloyd, another police forensic examiner, testified that fingerprints were not \nfound at the scene. (Tria1 Tr. Vol. 2, 62:8-63:4.)  He also testified that a \"non-secretor\" is less \n9 \n\n• \nlikely to leave fingerprints because he perspires less. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 63:20-64:4.)  However, \nOfficer Lloyd was not asked, and did not clarify. that by \"non-secretor\" he meant a person who \nexudes little or no oils on his or her skin and that such a non-secretor was not in any way related \nto the non-secretor test performed by Ms. Lytle. \nThe purported fact that the forensic evidence entered at trial could not exclude Mr. Vinson, \nand, according to the prosecution, also narrowed the pool of potential suspects to a small portion \nof the population, was an essential element in the overall evidence \"against\" Mr. Vinson.  As a \nresult, in closing argument, the prosecutor repeatecUy returned to the forensic testimony and \nargued that it supported Camille's shaky identification.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 17:4-6, 13-17,20-21, \nMay 14, 1986.)  The jury even requested to review the forensic evidence during its deliberations \nbecause it was so important to the prosecution's case. (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 62:24-63:25.) \nFollowing his conviction, Mr. Vinson repeatedly requested DNA testing on the forensic \nevidence, but these requests were denied, and at some point the Detroit Police Department \ndestroyed the samples. (See Exhibit B, Mr. Vinson's Letter to the Detroit Police Department, \nSept. 24, 1991; Detroit Police Department Response to Mr. Vinson, Nov. 22, 1991; Mr. Vinson's \nLetter to Hon. Vera Massey Jones, Mar. I, 1993; Han. Vera Massey Jones Response to Mr. \nVinson, Mar. 4, 1993; Mr. Vinson's Letter to Hon. Dalton Roberson, Apr. 29, 1993; Detroit \nPolice Department Response to Mr. Vinson, May 20,1993; Detroit Police Department Response \nto Mr. Vinson, June I, 1993; Detroit Police Department Response to Mr. Vinson, Aug. 26, \n2006.) \nNew test results prove that Mr. Vinson is innocent.  Dr. Judith Westrick, a chemistry \nprofessor at Lake Superior State University, obtained blood and saliva samples from Mr. Vinson \nfor testing.  In a report dated February 25, 2009, Dr. Westrick concluded that Mr. Vinson is an \n!O \n\n--\nAS secretor.  (See Exhibit C, Dr. Judith Westrick Lab Report, Feb. 5, 2009.)  The Michigan \nInnocence Clinic accepted Mr. Vinson's case in February 2009, after being presented with Dr. \nWestrick's lab results indicating that Mr. Vinson is a blood type AB secretor.  To confinn Dr. \nWestrick's results, semen and saliva samples were collec(ed from Mr. Vinson on June 3, 2009. \nThese samples were sent for testing to Arthur Young, a forensic biologist with NMS labs in \nWillow Grove. Pennsylvania.  Mr. Young's tests on both semen and saliva samples confinned \nthat Mr. Vinson is an AS secretor.  (See Exhibit D, NMS Labs Forensic Biology Laboratory \nReport by Arthur Young, June 12,2009; Hann.-Weir Aff., June 5, 2009; Dr. Ray Aff., June 5, \n2009.)  Both Mr. Young and Ms. Lytle have confirmed by affidavit that Mr. Vinson being an AS \nsecretor means that A and B blood antigens should have been found in the semen stain at the \nscene of the crime, and because they were not Mr. Vinson could not have been responsible for \nthis crime.  (See Exhibit E, Lytle Aff., 2 ~ 9, Apr. 15,2009; Exhibit F, Young Aff, 3 ~9, June 17, \n2009.) \nAdditionally, expert analysis of the results of the 2009 testing exposed that the original \nforensic evidence itself exonerates Mr. Vinson.  The new evidence indicates that the original \nforensic evidence contained blood type 0 semen, which could not have been contributed by Mr. \nVinson, who is blood type AB.  Therefore, even with the false non-secretor result, the original \nforensic evidence should have exonerated Mr. Vinson. \nOn May 14, 1986, Mr. Vinson was convicted of criminal sexual conduct (eSC 1) and \nbreaking & entering with intent to commit a felony (B&E).  On May 29,1986, Mr. Vinson was \nsentenced to concurrent sentences of 10-50 years and 5·15 years.  The latter sentence was \ndischarged on November J 9, 1998.  Mr. Vinson is currently serving the remainder of his \nsentence at G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan. \nII \n\n• \nMr. Vinson, through his appellate counsel, appealed his conviction as of right to the \nMichigan Court of Appeals, which affirmed his conviction on October 25, 1988 (Appeals Case \nNumber: 00-006682-AP).  Mr. Vinson's appeal only covered the issue of prosec uto ria I \nmisconduct, claiming that the prosecutor introduced evidence in his closing argument that was \npreviously excluded by this Court.  (See Exhibit G, Direct Appeal cured brief filed Jan. 22, \n1987); People v.  Vinson, No. 94565 (Oct. 25, 1988) (opinion affirming conviction).  Mr. Vinson \nthen filed, in pro per, a letter request in the Michigan Supreme Court for leave to appeal.  On \nJune 27,1989, the Michigan Supreme Court denied Mr. Vinson's letter request for leave.  People \nv.  Vinson, No. 84710 (June 27, 1989).  On October 10,2000, Mr. Vinson filed, in pro per, a \nmotion for relief from judgment raising ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.  This \nmotion was denied on March 5, 2001 (Case Number: 86-000214).  Mr. Vinson tried again in \n2006, but was again denied on January 23, 2006 (Case Number: 86-0214).  (See Exhibit H, \nMotion for Relief from Judgment, filed Oct. 10,2000; Denial of Motion in Full, Mar. 5, 2001; \nDenial of Motion in Full, Jan. 23, 2006.)  Mr. Vinson did not appeal these adverse rulings.  On \nFebruary 11,2006, Mr. Vinson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Northern Division (Case Nwnber: 06-10850-\nBC).  The court granted a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal because the motion \nwas filed outside the one-year limitations period and Mr. Vinson had not established an \nentitlement to equitable tolling of that period. See Exhibit I, Vinson v. Vasbinder, No. 06·10850· \nBe (Dec. 7,2006).  Mr. Vinson did not appeal. \nIn July 2001, Mr. Vinson contacted the then-new Cooley Law Schoollnnocence Project, \nwhich agreed to look for Camille Wilson's rape kit in the hope that DNA testing could be done \non the kit.  (See Exhibit J, Fleener Jr. Aff., June 10,2009.) After years of searching, the Cooley \n12 \n\nInnocence Project confirmed that Camille's stained sheet and panties from the night of the attack \nwere destroyed by the Detroit Police Department.  (See Exhibit J, ~~ 14·15.)  The Cooley \nInnocence Project also found that the rape kit could not be located.  (See Exhibit J,  16·19.) \nAfter undersigned counsel consulted with the prosecution in June 2009, a pathology slide with \nbiological material collected from the victim was located at Children's Hospital.  The slide was \nsent to the Michigan State Police Crime Lab, where an initial examination determined that the \nslide was intact and could be tested.  The slide was then forwarded to NMS labs for DNA testing. \nUnfortunately, DNA tests on the slide were Wlable to identify a male DNA profile from the \nbiological material on the slide.  (See Exhibit Z. Young Afr.,  ~ 8-9, Sept. 9, 2009.) \nII.  The Current Claims \nMr. Vinson now seeks relief from judgment under five claims; each merits the relief he seeks \nof its own accord.  First, Mr. Vinson seeks relief for the newly discovered evidence that he is an \nAB secretor.  At trial, the prosecutor presented testimony that Mr. Vinson was an AB non· \nsecretor, and used this evidence to link Me. Vinson to the crime.  The new evidence that Mr. \nVinson is an AB secretor conclusively proves that Mr. Vinson could not have contributed the \nsemen found at the scene and therefore conclusively proves that Mr. Vinson is innocent. \nSecond, Mr. Vinson seeks reHeffor the newly discovered evidence that, even with the false \nnon-secretor test result, the sheet stain almost certainly contained blood type 0 semen which Mr. \nVinson could not have contributed because he is blood type AB.  The new evidence indicates \nthat Mr. Vinson is innocent because he could not have contributed the semen found at the scene \nof the crime based on the original forensic evidence presented against rum at trial. \nThlrd, Mr. Vinson seeks relief for ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to investigate \nthe forensic evidence.  Both his trial and appellate counsel failed to seek independent testing of \n13 \n\n,. \nthe forensic evidence, and therefore did not discover this new evidence which establishes that \nMr. Vinson could not have been responsible for the semen left at the scene of the crime. \nFourth, Mr. Vinson seeks relief for ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to rebut the \nprosecution's expert testimony. Trial counsel was ineffective in her cross-examination of expert \nwitnesses, failing to establish that the forensic evidence available at the time of trial should have \nexculpated Mr. Vinson.  Appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to litigate this ineffective \nassistance of trial counsel. \nFifth. Mr. Vinson requests relief for prosecutorial misconduct.  The prosecutor strongly \nrelied on the forensic evidence at trial.  First, the prosecutor falsely claimed that the original \nforensic evidence supported Mr. Vinson's guilt, when the evidence should have cleared Mr, \nVinson of involvement.  Second, to bolster the case against Mr. Vinson, the prosecutor \nmisrepresented the forensic evidence to falsely include Mr. Vinson in a small class of individuals \nwho could have committed the crime.  Third, the prosecutor improperly linked the forensic \nevidence of Mr. Vinson's secretor status to the lack of forensic fingerprint evidence, claiming \nthat the lack of fingerprint evidence further supported Mr. Vinson's guilt.  The prosecutor's \nmisrepresentations of the forensic evidence compromised the fairness afMr. Vinson's trial, \nviolating Mr. Vinson's constitutional right to due process and thus requiring relief from \njudgment of conviction. \nIll.  Successive Motion for Relief From Judgment under MeR 6.500 \nMr. Vinson properly brings this successive Motion for Relief from Judgment under the \nexception noted in MeR 6.502(G)(2), as he is alleging newly discovered evidence of irulOcence. \nThis newly discovered evidence fits the four conditions required by the rule - that (I) \"the \nevidence itself, not merely its materiality, was newly discovered; (2) the newly discovered \n14 \n\n.' \nevidence was not cumulative; (3) including the new evidence upon retrial would probably cause \na different result; (4) the party could not, using reasonable diligence, have discovered and \nproduced the evidence at trial.\" People v. Johnson, 451 Mich. 115, Its n.6, 545 N.W.2d 637 \n(1996); MeR 6.508(0).  Each of these five claims was only recently discoverable because the \nresu1ts of the new biological testing were only available in February of 2009 and confirmed in \nJune of 2009.  Only during this time was Mr. Vinson able to have his case reviewed by scientific \nexperts, who analyzed the results of the tests on Mr. Vinson's bodily fluids.  The new evidence \nwas undiscoverable before because Mr. Vinson was ineffectively represented by counsel and \nthen proceeded pro per, during which time he was unable to arrange biological testing himself or \nto afford the scientific experts needed until undersigned counsel took his case in February 2009. \nMr. Vinson's successive Motion for Relief from Judgment is also proper under MeR \n6.508(0) because this newly discovered evidence not only shows the required \"significant \npossibility that [Mr. Vinson] is irmocent of the crime\" but conclusively proves that Mr. Vinson is \ninnocent.  MCR 6.508(D). \nArgument \nI.  KARL VINSON IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT DUE TO NEWLY \nDISCOVERED EVIDENCE CONTRADICTING THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE USED \nAGAINST HIM AT TRIAL. \nRecently discovered new evidence of actual innocence conclusively rebuts any forensic \npossibi,lity that Mr. Vinson raped Camille Wilson, contrary to the prosecution's presentation to \nthe jury.  The newly discovered forensic evidence that Mr. Vinson is a blood type AB secretor \nhas not been previously presented to this court because the collection and laboratory analysis of \nMr. Vinson's bodily fluids only occurred in February and June of this year, 2009. The results \n15 \n\n, \nwere only recently obtained by Mr. Vinson's new counsel, and were not previously discoverable. \nAs a result, Mr. Vinson's successive motion for relief from judgment is proper under MeR \n6.502(0)(2).  Mr. Vinson's successive Motion for Relief from Judgment is also proper under \nMeR 6.508(D) because this new evidence proves that Mr. Vinson is innocent of this crime. \nThis newly discovered evidence fits the four conditions required by the rule - that \"(1) the \nevidence itself. not merely its materiality, was newly discovered; (2) the newly discovered \nevidence was not cumulative; (3) including the new evidence upon retrial would probably cause \na different result; (4) the party could not, using reasonable diligence, have discovered and \nproduced the evidence at trial.\" Johnson, supra at 118 n.6; MeR 6.508(D).  This evidence is \nnewly discovered because it was only obtained in February of2009 and confirmed in June of \n2009.  Mr. Vinson could not, using reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced the \nevidence at trial because he was ineffectively represented by counsel, as discussed infra in Parts \nIII and IV, and then proceeded pro per, during which time he was unable to arrange biological \ntesting himself or to afford the scientific experts needed until undersigned counsel took his case \nin February 2009.  This evidence is not cumulative of any evidence available at trial. \nA different result is not only probable on retrial but inevitable.  The standard to judge this \nnew evidence is whether \"but for the alleged error, the defendant would have had a reasonably \nlikely cbance of acquittal.\"  MeR 6.508(D)(3)(b)(i).  Ms. Lytle, who testified at trial that the \nforensic evidence did not exclude Me. Vinson, would now testify that the forensic evidence \nexonerates Mr. Vinson because if Mr. Vinson was the rapist both A and B antigens would have \nbeen found in the semen stain, (Exhibit E, 2 ~ 9; Exhibit F, 3  9), but were not, (Exhibit C, 3  I,·  \nsee Exhibit D; Exhibit F, 3 ~ 9).  Additionally, the prosecutor could not have relied  on the \nforensic evidence to support Mr. Vinson's guilt as he did in his closing arguments.  (Trial Tr. \n16 \n\n• \nVol. 3, 17:2-6, 14-I 7,20-21); see infra Part V.  Therefore, the new evidence that Mr. Vinson is \nan AB secretor would have made a conviction impossible, because Mr. Vinson could not have \nt \nleft the semen found at the scene.  (Exhibit E, 2  9; Exhibit F, 3  9.) \nA.  New forensic testing conclusively proves Karl Vinson's inDocence. \nNew forensic testing conclusively shows that Mr. Vinson is an AB secretoT, contradicting \nprosecution witness testimony and evidence used against Mr. Vinson at trial.  Mr. Vinson's \nsecretor status establishes his innocence. \nPaula Lytle tested Camille and found her to he blood type O.  Ms. Lytle also tested Camille's \nsaliva for blood type and found Camille to be a secretor.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 75:23-76:16, May 13, \n1986.) A mixed blood and semen stain was found at the scene on Camille's bed sheet by Officer \nBadacewski and sent to Ms. Lytle for blood type testing. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 68:16·24.) Ms. Lytle \ntested the sheet stain and found onJy blood type O.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 78:4·13.)  Ms. Lytle \ntestified that she tested Mr. Vinson and found that he is an AS non·secretor, meaning his blood \ntype is not present in bodily fluids other than his blood.  (See Exhibit A; Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 77:2· \n24.)  As an AS non·secretor, she testified at trial that Mr. Vinson was not excluded by the test \nresults from the stain left on Camille's sheet.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 78:14·24.) \nRecent tests on Mr. Vinson's blood, saliva, and semen prove that Mr. Vinson is an AS \nSecretor.  (Exhibit C, 3  1; see Exhibit D; Exhibit F, 3 ~ 9.)  Separate and independent lab results \nby Dr. Judy Westrick and NMS Labs prove Mr. Vinson's AB secretor status. (See Exhibit C, 3 \n1; Exhibit D.)  Although unnecessary because saliva and semen tests are redundant, see Exhibit \nK. Examination of the correlation of groupings in blood and semen, 30 J. Forensic Sci. 103, 103· \n113 (1985), a semen test has also proven that Mr. Vinson is an AB secretor.  (See Exhibit D; \nExhibit F, 3 ~ 9.)  Both Paula Lytle, the original serologist for the Detroit Police Crime Lab who \n17 \n\nconducted the original testing, and Arthur Young, an independent serologist with NMS Labs \nhave sworn in affidavits that these new tests conclusively exonerate Mr. Vinson because if Mr. \nVinson was the rapist, A and B antigens would have been found in the semen stain.  (Exhibit E, 2 \n~ 9; and Exhibit F, 3  9), but were not, (Exhibit C, 3 ~ I; Exhibit D; and Exhibit F, 3  9.)  Ms. \nLytle and Mr. Young both agree that Mr. Vinson being an AB secretor conclusively proves that \nthe semen sample could not have been left by Mr. Vinson.  (Exhibit E, 2  9; Exhibit F, 3  9.) \nThis newly discovered evidence of Mr. Vinson's true secretor status conclusively shows that he \ncould not have committed this crime.  (Exhibit E, 2  9; Exhibit F, 3  9.) \nB.  Ms. Lytle identified a failure of the original test protocol as a reasonablv likely \ncause for the erroneous finding of Don-secretor status .. \nThe original Detroit Crime Lab results finding Mr. Vinson to be a non-secretor were \nerroneous.  The test to see if someone is a secretor or a non-secretor simply looks for blood type \nantigens - if blood type antigens are not found, the person is identified as a non-secretor to \nexplain the absence of the blood type antigens.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 77:10-24, May 13, 1986.)  In \nber 2009 affidavit, Ms. Lytle described the testing done in 1986 and further described how the \nerror might have been made.  Ms. Lytle explained that the erroneous determination that Mr. \nVinson was a non-secretor could have resulted if the tested piece of the paper disk used to collect \nthe saliva had not been fully soaked in saliva.  (Exhibit E, I fJ~ 3-4.)  Under the testing protocol \nfollowed by the Detroit Crime Lab in 1986, a paper disk would be soaked with the subject's \nsaliva.  (Exhibit E, I , 3.)  The lab technician would let the paper disk dry and then cut a piece \nfrom it to create a sample to be tested.  (Exhibit E, 1 '3.) When the technician allowed the disk \nto dry out, the portions of the disk that were saturated with saliva were indistinguishable from \nany portions ofthe disk that had not been saturated.  (Exhibit E, I  4.) Therefore, a person who \n18 \n\nwas a secretor would have been \"found\" to be a non-secretor if the paper disk was not fully \nsatW'ated with saliva and the technician tested a portion of the disk that had not been saturated. \n(Exhibit E, 1 14.) \nAs designed, the test can give an accurate non-secretor result if the person is truly a non-\nsecretor because the status of the semen donor would explain the absence of blood type antigens \nin the test result.  (Exhibit E, 11  3.)  However, the test can also give an inaccurate non-secretor \nresult if the part of the paper tested by the technician did not have sufficient saliva for the test \nbecause this also explains the absence of blood type antigens in the test result.  (Exhibit E, I \n4.)  If this were the case, it was likely not obvious to the forensic technician doing the testing \n'J \nbecause saliva dries clear, (Exhibit E, 1  4), unlike a blood or semen stain where the location of \nthe bodily fluid would be obvious because of the color of the bodily fluid. \nThis simple explanation demonstrates that the secretor/non-secretor test used against Mr. \nVinson was error prone.  This error does not affect Ms. Lytle's other test results because blood \ntype antigens were detected in each of the other blood type tests performed by Ms. Lytle.  For \nexample, the sheet stain test found blood type 0 antigens, indicating that the test worked because \nantigens were found, as compared to the error in Mr. Vinson's secretor/non-secretor test which \nfalsely reported the absence of all blood type antigens. \nII.  KARL VINSON IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT DUE TO \nNEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE THAT THE ORIGINAL FORENSIC \nEVIDENCE USED AGAINST HIM AT TRIAL ACTUALLY EXONERATES \nHIM. \nRecently discovered new evidence of actual iMocence shows that the original forensic \ntesting in fact rebuts the forensic possibility that Mr. Vinson was the attacker of Camille Wilson, \ncontrary to the prosecution's presentation to the jury.  The original forensic testing shows that the \n19 \n\n, \nblood type 0  found on Camille Wilson's sheet almost certainly carne from semen present, which \ndoes not match Mr. Vinson's AB blood type.  This evidence has not been presented to this court \nbecause this evidence was only discovered when independent experts tested Mr. Vinson's \nsecretor status and reviewed the forensic evidence used against him at trial. The collection and \nlaboratory analysis afMr. Vinson's bodily fluids only occurred in February and June of this \nyear, 2009, with the resuJts were only recently obtained by Mr. Vinson's new counsel, and \ntherefore was not previously discoverable.  As a result, Mr. Vinson's successive motion for relief \nfrom judgment is proper under MeR 6.502(G)(2). Me Vinson's successive Motion for Relief \nfrom Judgment is also proper under MeR 6.508(0) because this new evidence strongly suggests \nthat Mr. Vinson is innocent of this crime. \nThis newly discovered evidence fits the four conditions required by the rule - that \"( 1) the \nevidence itself, not merely its materiality, was newly discovered; (2) the newly discovered \nevidence was not cumulative; (3) including the new evidence upon retrial would probably cause \na different result; (4) the party could not, using reasonable diligence, have discovered and \nproduced the evidence at trial.\" Johnson, supra at 118 n.6; MeR 6.508(D).  This new evidence is \nnewly discovered because it was only obtained as the results from the June 2009 were analyzed. \nMr. Vinson could not, using reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced the evidence at \ntrial because he was ineffectively represented by counsel and then proceeded pro per, during \nwhich time he was unable to arrange biological testing himself or to afford the scientific experts \nneeded until undersigned counsel took his case in February 2009. This evidence is not \ncumulative of any evidence available at trial. \nA different result is not only probable on retrial but inevitable. The standard to judge this \nnew evidence is whether \"but for the alleged error, the defendant would have had a reasonably \n20 \n\nlikely chance ofacquitta!.\" MCR 6.508(D)(3)(b)(i).  Serological analysis of the original \nevidence strongly suggests that the blood type 0  found from the stain was from semen. Mr. \nVinson could not have contributed blood type 0 semen.  If Mr. Vinson had been responsible for \nthe crime blood type AB would have been detected, (Exhibit E, 2  9; Exhibit F, 3 ~ 9). Instead \nblood type 0 was detected, (Exhibit C, 3 ~ 1; Exhibit D; Exhibit F, 3 ~ 9), strongly suggesting \nthat even the original forensic evidence should have conclusively eliminated Mr. Vinson as a \nsuspect in this crime, even with the erroneous non-secretor test result. \nA.  Camille Wilson most likely did not contribute the blood type 0  found by Ms. \nLytle in tbe stain found at the crime scene, indicating that the blood type 0 \nfound by Ms. Lytle was from the semen source. proving that Mr. Vinson who is \nblood type AD could Dot have been responsible for this crime. \nThe mixed blood and semen stain on Camille Wilson's sheet was found to be blood type O. \n(See Exhibit A.)  Although Camille Wilson was found to be blood type 0, no testing was \nconducted for the presence of vaginal fluid on the sheet.  (See Exhibit A.)  When blood is mixed \nwith other bodily fluids, blood type antigens from blood are not detected when the mixture is \ntested for blood type antigens from the bodily fluid solely.  (Exhibit F, 2 ~ 6.)  Therefore, this \ntype of test, which is precisely the lest conducted by the Detroit Crime Lab, can only determine \nthe blood type of the semen in a mixture of blood and semen.  (Exhibit F, 2 ~ 6.)  In the absence \nof vaginal fluid, the blood type 0  found would conclusively have come from the semen in the \nsheet stain.  Even if vaginal fluid were present, the blood type 0  would most likely have come \nfrom the semen in the stain.  It has never been disputed that Mr. Vinson is blood type AB.  (See \nExhibit A.)  If Mr. Vinson was the rapist, A and B antigens would have been found in the semen \nstain, (Exhibit E, 2 ~ 9; Exhibit F, 3  9), but were not, (Exhibit C, 3 ~ I; Exhibit 0; Exhibit F, 3 \n,. 9), proving that Mr. Vinson could not have been responsible for the semen found at the scene. \n21 \n\n1)  If Camille only donated blood to the mixed stain on her sheet, then the blood type \nfOWld in the sheet could only have come from the semen of someone who was blood \ntype 0, which is inconsistent with Karl Vinson's blood type AB, proving that Karl \nVinson could not have been responsible for this crime. \nIf Camille Wilson's only donation to the mixed stain was blood, then the blood type 0 \nantigens fOWld by Ms. Lytle could only have come from the semen source.  (Exhibit F, 2 1 6.) \nBlood type antigens from blood are not detected during blood type determination from other \nbodily fluids.  (Exhibit F, 2  6.) If the blood type 0 antigens came from the semen source, then \nMr. Vinson could not be the semen source because the forensic analysis would have detected the \npresence of A and B blood types, (Exhibit E, 2  9; Exhibit F, 3  9), but only found blood type \n0, (Exhibit C, 3 1 I; Exhibit D; Exhibit F, 3 1 9).  Therefore, Mr. Vinson could not have been \nresponsible for this crime because his blood type should have been detected in the sheet stain but \nwas not detected. \n2)  If Camille donated both blood and vaginal fluid to the mixed stain on her sheet, the \nblood type 0  found in the sheet still very likely was only contributed by the semen \nsource, which is inconsistent with Karl Vinson's blood type AB, proving that Karl \nVinson could not have been responsible for this crime. \nAt trial, Ms. Lytle indicated that identifying Camille Wilson as the source of the blood type \nfound on the sheet was improper, (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 83: 12·15,) Nonetheless, the prosecution \nargued that the blood type 0 present in the stain was from Camille Wilson, (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, \n32:6-15, May 14, 1986), despite this expert testimony from Ms. Lytle, the prosecution's own \nwitness. Although the point was not addressed further at trial, the review of the scientific \nliterature that follows suggests that Ms. Lytle would have been unable to detennine Camille \nWilson's blood type from the sample unless she tested the blood in the sample.  Blood type \nantigens from blood are undetectable in the test performed by Ms. Lytle because they are \ninsoluble, (Exhibit F, 2  6); therefore Camille Wilson's blood could not have contributed the \n22 \n\n, \nblood type 0 detected by Ms. Lytle in the testing that she conducted.  IrCamille Wilson \ncontributed the blood type 0 detected by Ms. Lytle then it could only have come from Camille \nWilson's vaginaJ fluid. \nSemen contains high quantities of blood type antigens, while vaginal fluid does not.  (Exhibit \nF,3  8.)  The victim's \"profuseO\" bleeding, (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 9:7-22, May 13, 1986), confirmed \nby her mother, (Trial Tr. Vol. 1,225:17-25,236:12-19. May 12, 1986), strongly suggests that \nantigens from vaginal fluid would have been undetectable in the stain, indicating that the blood \ntype 0 detected in the stain was not from Camille Wilson, but rather from her assailant, the only \nsource other than Camille's vaginal fluid in the slain.  This strongly suggests that the blood type \no \nfound in the stain was from the semen of a blood type 0 donor.  Mr. Vinson was known at the \ntime of trial to be blood type AB, (Trial Tr. Vol.2, 76: 19-77:5, May 13, 1986.) and therefore \nshould have been exonerated by the original forensic evidence because he could not have \ncontributed blood type 0  semen to the stain found at the scene. \nThe peer-reviewed scientific literature strongly indicates that blood type detennination from \nvaginal fluid in a mixed sample is unlikely because the blood type antigens from the vaginal \nfluid would be too dilute to be detected in recognizable amounts.  See Exhibit L, Akhiko Kimura \net aI., ABO blood grouping of semen from mixed body fluids with monoclonal antibody to tissue \nspecific epitooes on seminal ABO blood group substance, 104 Int'l J Legal Med. 255, 255-58, \n257 fig.5 (1991). In each of the three specimens in this study, where undiluted vaginal extract \nwas a part of the mixture, the blood type antigens from the vaginal fluid were either \nundetectable, (Exhibit L, 257 fig.5, Box 2 and 3), or, as seen only in specimen 4, only very \nweakly detectable, (Exhibit L, 257 fig.5. Box 4.)  Specimen 1 in the study shows a mixed \nsolution containing blood type A secretor semen diluted 500 times with blood type B secretor \n23 \n\nsaliva also diluted 500 times.  Only blood type A was detected, indicating that semen contains far \nmore blood type antigens than does saliva, and that saliva would not hinder the determination of \nblood type from semen even if present in equal amounts.  (Exhibit L, 257 fig. 5, Box 1.) \nSpecimen 2 shows a mixed solution of blood type B secretor semen diluted 500 times and blood \ntype A secretor undiluted vaginal fluid extract.  Blood type A from the vaginal fluid was \nundetectable in this mixture, but the blood type B from the semen was still detected even at 500 \ntimes dilution indicating that even extensively diluted semen has far more blood type antigens \nthan an equivalent amount of undiluted vaginal fluid. (Exhibit L, 257 fig.5 Box 2.)  Specimen 3 \nf \nshows a mixed solution of blood type 0 secretor semen diluted 500 times and blood type A \nsecretor vaginal fluid extract.  Again, just as for Specimen 2, only the semen blood type is found \nin the blood type measurement with no indication of the vaginal fluid blood type.  (Exhibit L, \n257 fig.5, Box 3.)  Specimen 4 shows a mixed solution of blood type 0 non-secretor semen with \nblood type A secretor vaginal fluid.  Here the vaginal fluid blood type is found, but the measured \nintensity from the vaginal fluid blood type is still just above zero, (Exhibit L, 257 fig.5, Box 4), \nagain indicating that blood type antigens are extremely dilute in vaginal fluid.  Specimen 5 is \nparticularly important.  Specimen 5 shows AB secretor semen cliluted 500 times.  Both A and B \nblood types are shown strongly. \nThe above study demonstrates that if AB secretor semen was present in the sheet stain it \nwould have been strongly detected.  Ms. Lytle and Mr. Young confirm this finding. (Exhibit E, \n2 ~ 9; see Exhibit F, 3 ~ 9.)  This proves that Mr. Vinson, an AS secretor, (Exhibit C, 3 ~ I; \nExhibit 0; Exhibit F, 3 ~ 9), could not have been responsible for this crime because only blood \ntype 0 was found in the sheet stain.  (See Exhibit A.) \n24 \n\nEven if present, the amount of vaginal fluid was very likely too small to be detected by Ms. \nLytle.  The amount oflubrication produced by an adult vagina has been described as similar to a \nsweat film. See Exhibit M, William Masters & Virginia Johnson, Human Sexual Response 69 \n(1 st ed., Little, Brown and Company 1966) (1966).  Therefore, it is possible to estimate the \namOlUlt of fluid necessary for proper lubrication by estimating the surface area of the vagina and \ncomparing this with the thickness of a sweat film.  The surface area of an adult vagina must be \nsimilar to the size of an adult penis because it is \"potential rather than an actual space.\" (Exhibit \nM, 71.)  The surface area requiring lubrication of an adult vagina is found to be - 170.6 cm2 \n(using the surface area of a rod == n:*r2+2*1t\"r*h). See Exhibit N, Hunter Wessells et al., Penile \nLength in the Flaccid and Erect States: Guidelines for Penile Augmentation, 156 J. Urology 995, \n996 1.1 (1996). A sweat film thickness is found to be -0.0059 cm thick, see Exhibit 0, Enock \nJonathan, In vivo sweat film layer thickness measured by Fourier-domain optical coherence \ntomography, Optics and Lasers in Eng., Jan. 24, 2008, at 3 t.1, indicating that an adult vagina \nproduces approximately 1 ml of vaginal fluid during sexual arousal (170.6 cm2 .. 0.0056 cm -= \nIml). \nHowever, Camille Wilson was prepubescent at the time of the crime.  (See Exhibit P, \nProgress Notes from Children's Hospital.)  The vagina of a prepubescent girl is approximately \n10 percent of the size of an adult vagina, see Exhibit Q, Edith Boyd, Origins of the Study of \nHuman Growth 654 (Bhim Sen Savara & John Frederick Schilke eds., University of Oregon \nHealth Sciences Center Foundation 1980), indicating that the amount of vaginal fluid produced \nduring sexual arousal, all other things being equal, should also be approximately 10 percent of \nthe amount from an adult vagina, or -0.1 ml.  When the developmental state of the vagina is \nconsidered, the amount of vaginal fluid produced should be even less.  The prepubescent vagina \n25 \n\n, \nis described as \"dry, thin, nonelastic, and nonrugated\" and remains in this \"quiescent state until \nthe onset of puberty.\" See Exhibit R, Mary-Ann Shaffer & Anna-Barbara Moscicki, Rudolph's \nPediatrics 238 (Colin D. Rudolph & Abraham M Rudolph eds., Mcgraw-HiJl2003) (I 977).  The \ntissue of the vagina develops during puber:ty becoming thicker, (see Exhibit R, 238), to \naccommodate the buildup of fluids in the vaginal tissue that allow the tissue to release vaginal \nfluid. (see Exhibit M. 70).  This indicates that the amount of vaginal fluid produced by a \nprepubescent vagina must be quite small because the tissue has not yet developed to allow for an \nadult-like response, strongly suggesting that the estimate above of 0.1 ml for a smaller but fully \ndeveloped vagina is an upper limit of the actual amount produced. \nBy combining the above upper limit for the amount of vaginal fluid with the detection limit \nof the blood type test used by Ms. Lytle, it is possible to estimate the amount of blood required to \ndilute the vaginal fluid beyond the detection limit of the technique.  The concentration of blood \ntype antigens in vaginal flujd is small; dilutions beyond 63: 1 render these antigens undetectable. \n(Exhibit F, 3 '8.) Therefore, with 0.1 ml of vaginal fluid, a mere 6.3 ml of blood Gust over 1 \nteaspoon) would be required to dilute the vaginal fluid beyond the detection limit of the \n= \ntechnique used by Ms. Lytle (0.1 ml vaginal fluid· 63 ml bloodJl ml vaginal fluid  6.3 mI of \nblood). The emergency room physician, Dr. Helene Tigchelaar, indicated that it was \"hard to \nsay\" how much bleeding occurred when Camille's injury was first caused, but expected a wound \nsuch as Camille Wilson's would bleed \"profusely,\" anq. indicated that the injury required surgery \nto correct.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 9:7-22, May 13, 1986.) Although \"profuse\" does not indicate the \nactual amount of blood loss, it certainly describes blood Joss exceeding 6.3 ml Gust over 1 \nteaspoon) when stated by an ER doctor who must see many severe injuries and has no reason to \nexaggerate the nature of the injuries when it would be clear because surgery was required to \n26 \n\nrepair the damage.  This excessive bleeding was also confirmed by her mother, who noted that \nthere was \"blood allover the toilet seat\" after Camille went to the bathroom after talking with the \nSex Crimes Unit and who gave Camille sanitary pads to control the bleeding.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 1. \n225:17-25,236:12-19, May 12, 1986.) \nGiven the small amount of blood required to dilute the vaginal fluid such that it would not be \ndetected in the blood type analysis, and that blood is not detected by the test Ms. Lytle used, it is \nvery unlikely that the blood type 0 detected from the stain by Ms. Lytle was contributed by \nCamille Wilson. \n3)  The victim's blood is very unlikely to have interfered with the blood type testing of \nthe semen in the mixed stain on the sheet, which Ms. Lytle found to be blood type 0, \nproving that Karl Vinson as an AB secretor could not have been responsible for this \ncrime because blood type AB was not found in the stain on the sheet. \nBlood and the blood type antigens in blood do not interfere with the analysis of blood type \nfrom other bodily fluids. (Exhibit F, 2  6.)  However, it may be suggested that blood could \ndilute the blood type antigens from the semen to such an extent that they were not detectable, but \nthis is not possible in this case. \nFar more blood would be necessary to dilute semen compared to vaginal fluid.  First, semen \ncontains high quantities of blood type antigens while vaginal fluid does not.  (Exhibit F. 3 1 8.) \nSecond, the amount of semen was likely much higher than the amount of vaginal fluid.  Analysis \nin Section II(A)(2) suggests that the maximum amount of vaginal fluid was 0.1 mI, far less than \nthe average ejaculate size of2. 75 ml, see Exhibit S, Elisabeth Carlsen et aI., Evidence for \ndecreasing quality of semen during past 50 years, 305 BM] 609,. 610 (1992).  Third, independent \nexperts confirm that even if the amount of semen in the sample tested was low, it is reasonable to \nexpect a blood type determination of the semen's blood type to be possible and reliable.  (Exhibit \n27 \n\n, \nF, 3 1 8.)  Therefore, it is expected that the amount of blood required to dilute the semen would \nhave been extraordinarily high.  Such a large amount of blood would have been noticed and \nmentioned by the emergency room doctor, the police officer who examined the scene, or Camille \nWilson's mother, but none of these witnesses mentioned such extensive blood loss.  (Trial Tr. \nVo!' 2, 6:22-24, 49:5-9; Trial Tr. Vo!' I, 236: 16-19.) \nFor comparison, a similar analysis can be done for semen as was done in Section U(A)(2), \nsupra, for vaginal fluid.  The average volume of human ejaculate is 2.75 ml. See Exhibit S, 610. \nBecause semen contains high quantities of blood type antigens, semen can be diluted up to 255 \nparts water to 1 part semen and still have a reliable blood type test of the semen.  (Exhibit F, 3 \n8.)  Therefore, in order for the blood to have diluted an average-sized ejaculate down to \nundetectable limits Camille Wilson would have had to bleed at least 0.7 L (or approximately 3 \ncups) of blood onto the semen (2.75 ml semen· 255 parts water I 1 part semen == 701.25 ml -=· \n0.7 L), a vastly higher quantity that the mere 6.3 ml of blood Gust over 1 teaspoon) necessary to \ndilute vaginal fluid such that it would be undetectable. For comparison, a unit of blood for \ndonation purposes is less than 0.5 L. See Exhibit T, Am. Ass'n of Blood Banks, Circular of \nInformation for the Use of Human Blood and Blood Components 11, (2002).  Normal children \nhave -80 ml of blood per kg of body weight.  See Exhibit U, Dan C. Darrow et aI., Blood \nvolwne in normal infants and children,S J. Clin. Invest. 243, 248 chart I (l928).  At the time of \nthe crime Camille Wilson weighed 56,7 kg, (Exhibit V, Camille Wilson Nurse's Assessment \nForm), and so she only bad -4.5 liters of blood (56.7 kg • 80 ml blood I kg of body weight = \n4536 ml ~ 4.5 L of blood).  This suggests that Camille Wilson would have had to lose -15 \npercent of her blood in order to dilute the blood antigens from the semen down to undetectable \nlevels. \n28 \n\nBlood loss of this magnitude would have been detected and noted by the emergency room \ndoctor, but was not.  Although Dr. Tigchelaar indicated that it was \"hard to say\" how  much \nbleeding occurred when Camille's injury was fIrst caused, she did expect that such a wound \nwould bleed \"profusely,\" and indicated that the injury required surgery to correct. (Trial Tr. Vol. \n2,9:7-22.)  Dr. Tigchelaar did not describe any actual \"profuse\" blood loss; she only found \n\"bloody discharge\" and some mucus.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 6:22-24.)  lfCamille Wilson lost enough \nblood to dilute the blood type antigens in the semen enough that they could not be detected, she \nwould likely have had heart complications from the blood loss, see Exhibit W, Practice \nparameter for the use of red blood cell transfusions: Developed by the Red Blood Cell \nAdministration Practice Guideline Development Task Force of the College of American \nPathologists 3, http://findarticles.com/p/articleslmi_qa3725/is_199802lai_n8803 744/ (last visited \nJune 27, 2009), and immediate corrective surgery may have been abnormally dangerous without \na blood transfusion.  See Exhibit X, Pierre Foex, Unexplained preoperative tachycardia: is it an \nimportant issue? Editorial, 52 Can. J. Anesth. 789 (2005).  Dr. Tigchelaar did not describe any \nsymptoms that would have caused concern about the corrective surgery, though she took the time \nto fully describe the severity of the injuries, (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, II: 15-22), strongly suggesting tbat \nsuch symptoms from extensive blood loss were not present.  Further, Officer Hankins only \ndescribed the bloodstain as \"red\" and \"kind of wet,\" (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 49:5-9), and Camille's \nmother said the blood \"wasn't gushing out, otherwise we would call the EMS,\" (Trial Tr. Vol. 1, \n236:16-19.). These descriptions do not suggest that Camille lost the amount of blood necessary \nto dilute the semen enough for semen antigens to not be detected. \nClearly Camille Wilson did not lose enough blood to dilute the blood type antigens from the \nsemen beyond the detection limit of the technique used by Ms. Lytle.  Given the analysis in \n29 \n\nSection Il(A)(2) indicating that Camille Wilson likely did not contribute the blood type 0 \ndetected in the stain by Ms. Lytle. whoever left the semen in the stain must have been blood type \nO.  Because Mr. Vinson is blood type AS he is conclusively exonerated since he could not have \nleft the semen found at the scene of the crime. \nB.  Even if the blood type 0  found in the stain by Ms. Lytle was contributed bv \nCamille Wilson, her actual attacker still must have also been blood type 0 or a \nnonsecretor, proving that Karl Vinson as a blood type AB secretor could not \nhave been responsible for this crime. \nEven if Camille Wilson donated vaginal fluid to the stain. the forensic evidence is \ninconsistent with Mr. Vinson.  If Camille donated vaginal fluid to the mixed stain. then blood \ntype 0 could have been detected from her vaginal fluid. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 76:3-16.) However, \nsemen contains high quantities of blood type antigens, while vaginal fluid does not.  (Exhibit F, 3 \n~ 8.)  Therefore even in the unlikely event that there was as much vaginal fluid present as semen. \nin this scenario the presence of blood type antigens from the vaginal fluid indicates that the blood \ntype antigens from the semen should have been determinable as well.  However, based on Ms. \nLytle's testing only blood type 0  was present.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 68:16-24, 78:4-13.) Ms. Lytle's \nresult from the stain is inconsistent with Mr. Vinson who is an AB secretor, (Exhibit E, 2 ~ 9; \nExhibit F. 3 ~ 9). proving he could not have been responsible for this crime. \nIll. ALTERNATIVELY, KARL VINSON IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF FROM \nJUDGMENT DUE TO INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL AND APPELLATE \nCOUNSEL FOR FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE \nOne of the most fundamental rights in the criminal justice system is the Sixth Amendment \nright to effective assistance of trial counsel.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).  If \nthis court concludes that the new evidence of actual innocence discussed in Arguments I and II, \nsupra, cowd have been discovered at the time of trial, then it follows that trial counsel's \n30 \n\n, \nperformance in this case fell woefully below the minimum standard set forth in Strickland.  To \nshow that trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective, Mr. Vinson must first show that trial \ncounsel's performance was so deficient that it \"fell below an objective standard,  of \nreasonableness.\"  Id. at 688.  Second, Mr. Vinson must show that \"there is a reasonable \nprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the results of[his trial] would have been \ndifferent.\" Id at 694.  \"The result of a proceeding can be rendered unreliable, and hence the \nproceeding itself unfair, even if the errors of counsel cannot be shown by a preponderance of the \nevidence to have determined the outcome.\"  Jd at 694.  This Sixth Amendment right also \nrequires the effective assistance of appellate counsel on direct appeal.  Evilts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. \n387,395-97 (1985).  When the failure is lack of investigation, Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 \n(2003), dictates that counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make reasonable \ndecisions about what makes particular investigations unnecessary. \nMr. Vinson's trial counsel and appellate counsel were constitutionally ineffective for not \ninvestigating this evidence that would have established that Mr. Vinson could not have \ncommitted this crime.  This groWld for relief was not raised and could not have been raised by \nMr. Vinson on appeal because both trial and appellate counsel failed to investigate the veracity \nof the forensic evidence.  Mr. Vinson raised an ineffective assistance of trial and appellate \ncounsel in his pro per Motion for Relief of Judgment.  Mr. Vinson did not and could not have \nspecifically raised counsels' failure to investigate the veracity of the forensic evidence because \nof his inability to independently investigate the veracity of the forensic evidence due to financial \nand practical constraints. \nThe prosecution relied heavily on forensic evidence to support Camille Wilson's testimony \nagainst Mr. Vinson. (Trial Tr. YoU, 17:4-6, 13-17,20-21, May 14, 1986.)  However, the newly \n31 \n\n, \ndiscovered forensic evidence conclusively shows that Mr. Vinson cou1d not have committed this \ncrime.  (Exhibit C, 3 1 1; see Exhibit 0; Exhibit E, 2  9; Exhibit F, 3 19.) Trial and appellate \ncounsel should have investigated whether the forensic evidence in fact implicated him as a \nsuspect.  Neither counsel arranged to have Mr, Vinson's secretor status determined by their own \nscientific experts, which would have shown that the result found by Ms. Lytle was incorrect and \nthat the prosecution's interpretation of the evidence was false.  Additionally, the rape kit, which \nwas not collected from the hospital to be tested by the police, would have given counsel an \nadditional opportunity to test the evidence against Mr. Vinson, but neither counsel made any \nattempt to obtain the sample or to have any independent testing performed. \nNor did either counsel seek the advice of their own scientific experts to determine if the \nprosecutor's representations of the forensic evidence were correct.  Trial and appellate counsel's \nrepresentation was constitutionally ineffective for all of the above reasons and requires relief \nfrom judgment. MeR 6.500; Evins, supra at 395·97; Strickland, supra at 687-88, 694; see.also \nRichey v. Bradshaw, 498 F Jd 344, 362 (6th Cir. 2007) (failure to investigate the conclusions of \nan expert witness was constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel resulting in a grant of \nfederal habeas petition); People v.  Caballero, 459 N.W.2d 80 (Mich. App. 1990) (failure to \ninvestigate witnesses is ineffective ifit results in counsel's ignorance of valuable evidence which \nwould have substantially assisted the accused); People v. Grant, 470 Mich. 477, 487-88, 493 \n(2004) (ineffective assistance for failure to investigate is fOWld where there is only the victim's \nstatement and questionably corroborative medical testimony and defense counsel fails to \ninvestigate the medical testimony); Driscoll v. Delo, 71  F.3d 70 I, 709 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding \nthat even where defense counsel elicited a concession from the state's expert that whether a \nparticular blood type was on a knife was entirely speculative, defense counsel was defective for \n32 \n\n, \nhaving failed to take measures \"to understand the laboratory tests perfonned and the inferences \nthat one could logically draw from the results\"). \nThough StrickJand dictat~s that \"strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law \nand facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable,\" it also requires cOlUlse[ to \n\"make reasonable investigations.\" Strickland, supra at 690-91. Importantly. this standard \ngoverns both what appellate counsel failed to do and what he should have advocated in an \nargument of trial counsel's ineffectiveness due to lack of proper investigation. A strategic choice \ncannot be made where, as here, a \"thorough investigation\" was not undertaken.  Therefore. trial \nand appellate counsel's representation was constitutionally ineffective and requires relief from \njudgment. MeR 6.500; Evitts, supra at 395·97; Strickland, supra at 687·688, 694. \nIV. KARL VINSON IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT DUE TO \nINEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL AND APPELLATE COUNSEL FOR \nINEFFECTIVE CROSS EXAMINATION OF EXPERT TESTIMONY \nMr. Vinson's trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failure to effectively rebut the \nforensic evidence used against Mr. Vinson.  Appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective \nfor failure to litigate the ineffectiveness of trial counsel.  \"[I]f counsel entirely fails to subject the \nprosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing, then there has been a denial of Sixth \nAmendment rights that makes the adversary process itself presumptively unreliable. No specific \nshowing of prejudice is required because the petitioner has been denied the right of effective \ncross·examination which would be constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of \nshowing of want of prejudice would cure it.\"  United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659 (1984). \nThis ground for relief has not been raised before and could not have been raised before because \nMr. Vinson was ineffectively assisted by appellate counsel. \n33 \n\n, \nTrial and appellate counsel should have investigated whether the prosecution's claims about \nthe forensic evidence were factual and should have corrected the improper conclusions given to \nthe jury.  Ms. Lytle testified that 20 percent of the people on Earth are non·secretors. (Trial Tr. \nVol. 2, 85: 12·13), but did not link the population ofnon-secretors to the population of potential \nsuspects.  The defense failed to follow-up on this point with Ms. Lytle that in fact type 0 \nsecretors could have produced the stain.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 85: 14-17.) In closing arguments the \nprosecution turned Ms. Lytle's statistic into a conclusion, arguing that the forensic results \"keep \n(Mr. Vinson} in there along with 20 percent of the population.\" (Trial Tr, Vol. 3,17:14-17.)  The \nprosecution again returned to the forensic evidence later in closing arguments to reiterate the \npoint that \"the blood tests keep [Mr. Vinson] in, they keep [Mr. Vinson] in.\"  (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, \n17:20·21.)  However, the mixed blood and semen stain was detennined to be blood type O. \n(Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 78:4·13.) Blood type 0 is the most common blood type and is shared by \napproximately 44 percent of the United States population.  See Exhibit Y, Blood Types in the \nU.S., http://bloodcenter.stanford.edulabout_bloodlblood_types.html (Last visited June 16, 2009). \nTherefore the analysis from Section 11 suggests that approximately 44 percent of the population \no. \ncould have been responsible for the stains test results of blood type  If the analysis in Section \nII is ignored then both men who are non·secretors and men with blood type 0 could have been \nresponsible for the stain's test result, a group of potential suspects that includes approximately 55 \npercent of the male population in the United States. \nInstead of pointing out that the prosecution was using the wrong statistic to describe the \npercent of the population implicated by the forensic evidence, trial counsel in effect conceded \nthat the finding that Mr. Vinson is a non·secretor was highly damaging when she argued that \n\"(w]ell, another point is that Karl Vinson is a nonsecretor ... it does not conclusively prove that \n34 \n\n, \nhe is the one.\" (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 29:6-12.)  The prosecution followed up on this in rebuttal again \nreiterating that ''the lab results do not say you are the person 100 percent because that's not the \nway it works.  What it does say is that it realize (sic) that only 20 percent of the population are \nnonsecretors. one out of five. That's not a very large amount.  And Camille Wilson tells us that \nthe defendant is the man that raped her.  It is no coincidence that he is a nonsecretor and out of \nthose stains and from those tests that we are able to determine only her blood type and not \ndetennine his because he, being a nonsecretor.\" (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 32: 6-15.)  Trial counsel failed \nto rebut the prosecution's incorrect statistical claim, allowing the forensic evidence available al \ntrial to be improperly used against him.  Appellate counsel then failed to litigate this ineffective \nassistance by trial counsel. \nIn addition, Officer Robert Lloyd, another police forensic examiner, testified that fingerprints \nwere not found at the scene.  Officer Lloyd testified that a \"non-secretor\" is less likely to leave \nfingerprints because he perspires less. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 62:8-63:4,.)  Officer Lloyd was not \nasked. and did not clarify, that by \"non-secretor\" he meant a person who exudes little or no oils \non his or her skin and that such a non-secretor was not in any way related to the non-secretor test \nperformed by Ms. Lytle.  During closing arguments, the prosecution linked the \"nonsecretor\" \nterm used by Officer Lloyd with the \"nonsecretor\" term used by Ms. Lytle, arguing that \"it just \nso happens that the evidence technician told us that nonsecretors are less likely to leave \nfingerprints.  Well, who happens to be a nonsecretor?  [Mr. Vinson] does.  There were (sic) some \nlaboratory work done.\" (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 14:24-15:3.) Trial and appellate counsel both failed to \nrebut the prosecution's incorrect link between separate forensic terminology. fingerprint non \nsecretor and blood type non-secretor. \nlS \n\n, \nFurther, trial and appellate counsel both failed to investigate and cross examine the expert \nwitnesses to detennine if the prosecution's interpretation of the forensic evidence was correct. \nAs recently discovered and described above in Section II, the original forensic evidence strongly \nsuggests that the blood type 0 found in the stain resulted from blood type 0 semen, which could \nnot have been contributed by Mr. Vinson. The prosecutor improperly linked the blood type 0 \nfound from the stain to Camille Wilson, \"out of those stains and from those tests that we are able \nto detennine only her blood type and not detennine his because he, being a nonsecretor,\" (Trial \nTr. Vol. 3, 32:6-15), despite the fact that this statement contradicted the testimony of Ms. Lytle, \nwho indicated that she could not determine the source of the blood type found on the sheet (Trial \nTr. VoL 2, 83: 12·15).  Trial and appellate counsel both failed to cross·examine the expert \nwitnesses to determine the origin of the blood type 0 found in the sheet stain.  This cross· \nexamination would have demonstrated that Mr. Vinson's blood type was not consistent with the \nforensic evidence regardless of the original secretor/non·secretor test results because Mr. Vinson \ncould not have produced the semen found at the scene. \n\"Cross-examination is the principaJ means by which the believability of a witness and the \ntruth of his testimony are tested.\"  Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316 (1974).  By failing to \nadequately cross examine the expert testimony of the prosecution defense \"entirely fail[ed] to \nsubject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing\" and thereby made \"the adversary \nprocess [] presumptively unreliable\" by denying Mr. Vinson the opportunity to confront the \nevidence against him.  Cronic, supra at 659.  Given the many misrepresentations of the forensic \nevidence by the prosecution, see Argument V, infra, the defense had adequate opportunity to \nrebut the prosecution's case but was constitutionally ineffective for failing to cross examine and \nthereby expose the true weakness of the prosecution's case.  See, e.g., Martin v. Rose, 744 F.2d \n36 \n\n, \ni245, i250-5 i (6th Cir. (984) (hoiding that defense counsei's \"totaii.ck of participation \ndeprived Martin of effective assistance of counsel at trial as thoroughly as ifhe had been absent,\" \nthereby violating Martin's Sixth Amendment rights \"even without any showing of prejudice\"). \nTrial and appellate counsel's representation was constitutionally ineffective for all of the above \nreasons and require relief from judgment. MeR 6.500; Evitts, supra at 395-97; Strickland, supra \n.t 687-688, 694. \nV. KARL VINSON IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT DUE TO \nPROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT FOR MISREPRESENTATION OF EXPERT \nTESTIMOMY. \nThe prosecutor's misconduct in misrepresenting the expert testimony used against Mr. \nVinson also denied Mr. Vinson a fair and reliable trial.  This ground for relief has not been raised \nbefore and could not have been raised before because Mr. Vinson was ineffectively assisted by \nboth trial and appellate counsel. \nThe prosecution's claims about the forensic evidence were factually incorrect. These \nmisrepresentations were outcome detenninative for several independent reasons.  First, the \nprosecutor misrepresented the original forensic evidence against Mr. Vinson which actually \nshows that Mr. Vinson could not have been involved in the crime.  Second, the prosecutor relied \nheavily on misrepresentations of statistical testimony and conflation of independent forensic tests \nto support the testimony of the prosecution's single eye witness, the nine-year old victim who did \nnot identify Mr. Vinson until given his name by her mother, (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 36: 8-24; Trial Tr. \nVol. 1,237:25-238: 17), testimony which was refuted by multiple defense witnesses who attested \nto Mr. Vinson's being elsewhere at the time of the crime.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 93:1-3 109:11-15.) \n37 \n\nThe prosecutor misrepresented the forensic evidence with misleading statistical testimony. \nMs. Lytle testified that 20 percent of the population are non-secretors, (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 85: 12-\n13). but did not link the population of non-secretors to the population of potential suspects.  The \nprosecutor improperly turned Ms. Lytle's statistic into a conclusion during closing arguments, \narguing that although the forensic technicians were \"not able to detennine a blood type that \nmatched [Mr. Vinson's], ... with a nonsecretor you do not expect to detennine their blood type \nfrom something like seminal fluid, which is what they had.\" (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 17:2-6, May 14, \n1986.) The prosecutor continued by suggesting that the forensic results \"keep [Mr. Vinson as a \nsuspect] along with 20 percent of the population.\" (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 17:14-17.)  Later the \nprosecution returned to the forensic evidence to reiterate that \"the blood tests keep {Mr. Vinson] \nin, they keep [Mr. Vinson] in.\" (Trial Tr. Voi.3, 17:20-21.) \nThe prosecution followed up on this in rebuttal, again reiterating that \"the lab results do not \nsay you are the person 100 percent because that's not the way it works.  What it does say is that \nit realize (sic) that only 20 percent of the population are nonsecretors, one out oftive.  That's not \na very large amount ... It is no coincidence that he is a nonsecretor and out of those stains and \nfrom those tests that we are able to determine only her blood type and not detennine his because \nhe, being a nonsecretor,\"  (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 32:6-15.) The prosecution, through this incorrect \nstatistical claim, improperly used the forensic evidence as additional evidence of guilt instead of \nas excluding Mr. Vinson, indisputably compromising the fairness of his trial.  The prosecutor's \ninterpretation of Ms. Lytle's statistic was not established by testimony at trial and is false.  The \nmixed blood and semen stain was determined to be blood type O.  (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 78:4-13.) \nBlood type 0 is the most common blood type and is shared by approximately 44 percent of the \nUnited States population. See Exhibit Y.  Even if the other misrepresentations with the expert \n38 \n\ntestimony are ignored and the prosecutor's argument is taken on jts face, both men who are non \nsecretors and men with blood type 0 could have been responsible for the stain '5 test resull of \nblood type O. This combined group of potential semen donors includes approximately 55 \npercent of the male population in the United States, not the 20 percent claimed by the prosecutor. \n(Trial Tr. Vol. 3,17:14-17.) \nThe prosecution continued misrepresenting expert testimony when it conflated the testimony \nby Ms. Lytle with the testimony by Officer Robert Lioyd, another police forensic examiner, \nregarding the lack of fingerprints at the scene.  Officer Lloyd testified that a \"non-secretor\" is \nless likely to leave fingerprints because he perspires less. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 62: 863:4.)  The \nprosecutor never clarified the record by asking Officer Lloyd to indicate that by \"non-secretor\" \nhe meant a person who exudes little or no oils on his or her skin, a \"non-secretor\" term unrelated \nto the non-secretor test performed by Ms. Lytle. Instead, during closing arguments the \nprosecution linked the \"nonsecretor\" tenn used by Officer Lloyd with the \"nonsecretor\" tenn \nused by Ms. Lytle, arguing that \"it just so happens that the evidence technician told us that \nnonsecretors are less likely to leave fingerprints.  Well, who happens to be a nonsecretor? [Mr. \nVinson] does.  There were (sic) some laboratory work done.\" (Trial Tr. Vol. 3,14:24-15:3.) \nHowever, no laboratory tests were ever performed or testified to showing that Mr. Vinson exudes \nlinle or no oils on his skin. There is no other coherent interpretation of the prosecution '5 \nargument other than the improper c~nf1ation of the non-secretor terms used by Ms. Lytle and \nOfficer Lloyd.  The prosecutor used this link to further support the misuse of statistics to indicate \nthat Mr. Vinson was one of a small group who could have committed the crime based on the \nforensic evidence. \n39 \n\nGoing beyond the other misrepresentations, the prosecutor also claimed that the blood type O' \ndetected in the stain was from Camille Wilson, (Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 32:6-15), outright contradicting \nthe testimony of its own expert, Ms. Lytle, who indicated that she could not determine the source \nof the blood type found on the sheet. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2, 83: 12-15.)  As discussed above in Section \nII, tests for blood type on the stain strongly suggest that the blood type 0 found in the stain \nresulted from blood type 0 semen, which could not have been contributed by Mr. Vinson. \nInstead ofproperJy representing the source of the blood type 0  found in the forensic evidence, \nthe prosecutor misinterpreted the forensic evidence for the jury and intentionally used the blood \ntype evidence as additional evidence of guilt against Mr. Vinson, indisputably compromising the \nfairness of Mr. Vinson's trial. \nThe prosecutor emphasized all of these misrepresentations by devoting a significant portion \nof closing and rebuttal arguments to falsely repeating that the forensic evidence supported the \ncase against Mr. Vinson.  The jury was focused on the expert testimony that was misrepresented \nby the prosecutor, even asking for the expert testimony to be read back during deliberations. \n(Trial Tr. Vol. 3, 62:24-63:25.) \nThe ''touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the \nfairness of the trial.\"  Smith v.  Phillips, 455 U.S. 209,219 (1982); see also People v. Bahoda, \n448 Mich. 261, 265-67 (1995).  An error is outcome determinative if it undermines the reliability \nof the verdict.  People v.  Whittaker, 465 Mich. 422, 427 (2001).  The prosecutor's \nmisrepresentations of forensic evidence violated Mr. Vinson's constitutional right to due process \nbecause the misrepresentations plainly compromised the fairness ofMr. Vinson's trial and fatally \nundermined the reliability of the jury's verdict, thereby requiring relief from judgment of \nconviction. \n40 \n\nThe prosecution has a constitutional duty, \"derived from the prosecution's duty to represent \nthe public interest, and to place the pursuit of truth and justice above the pursuit of conviction,\" \nPeople v. Cassell, 63 Mich. App. 226, 229 (1975), to not only report false testimony of its \nwitnesses, but also to correct false evidence, People v. Lester, 232 Mich. App. 262, 276-77 \n(1998).  A new trial is required where there is a reasonable likelihood that the false testimony \ncould have affected the verdict.  People v. Herndon, 246 Mich. App. 371,417-18 (2001). The \njury took the prosecution's misrepresentations about the forensic evidence seriously; it requested \nthat the expert testimony be read back during deliberations. (Trial Tr. Vol. Ill, 62-63 II. 24-25, 1-\n25, May 14, 1986.) Tills misconduct requires relief from judgment. \nWherefore, this Court should relieve Karl Vinson from his judgment of conviction, or hold a \nhearing to evaluate the issues raised in this motion. \nDated: September 14, 2009  Respectfully Submitted, \nMICHIGAN INNOCB~Il CLINIC \nr \nD-c<~.;e- r. \\,,(,.,,=4 J \nBridget  cCormaJk (P58537)  David  Moran (P4535  ) \n0 \nAttorney for Defendant  Attorn y for Defendan \nCo  - \\  .ja.ccy\" \" :-~  \\6..~ \"\"3\"'0.- j \\\" \n-'?§l~-l \"'~ I F~ \nSolana Flora  )  Jacque me Harnngton \nStudent Attorney for Defendant  Student Attorney for Defendant \n£6-_d~ '  \\c.~- ,''f'''''>  £;c':,Le~;.j~1 f=~ \nF  ces Kim  ) \nStudent Attorney for Defendant  Student Attorney for Defendant \nt,,~ ()~,=,-I i\"~ \nErin Opperm  I  Chad Ray \nStudent Attorney for Defendant  Student Attorney for Defendant \n41 \n\n: \nEXHIBIT C \n\n: \nSTATE OF MICfflGAN \nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR THE COUNTY OF WAYNE \nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, \nPlaintiff, \nvs  No. 82-05965 \nWALTER SWIFT, \nDefendant. \n__________________________,1  \nJOINT MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT \nKYMWORTHY \nWayne County Prosecuting Atlorney \nTIMOTHY A.

Chiefo  fR  esearch, Training. & Appeals, and \nJEFFREY CAMINSKY, Principal Attorney, Appeals, and Defendant, by and through BARRY C. \nSCHECK and OLGA AKSELROD, of The Innocence Projec4 and RICHARD LUSTIG, and under \nMeR 6.500 et seq hereby seek relief from the judgment of conviction entered in this matter for the \nfollowing reasons: \n1.  On November 10,1982. a jury of this Court convicted Defendant ofanned robbery, \nbreaking and entering, and two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct; on November 19, \n1982, the trial judge, Hon. Leonard Townsend, sentenced Defendant to 20-to-40 years imprisonment \nfortbe criminal sexual conduct convictions, and 1O -to-15 years imprisonment for the armed robbery. \nesc \nJudge Townsend dismissed the charge of Breaking and Entering with intent to commit  I on \ndouble jeopardy grounds. The Defendant is currently imprisoned at the Parnall Correctional Facility, \nwith a maximum discharge date of July 20. 2011 for his criminal sexual conduct convictions. \n\n: \n2.  On March 16, 1984 the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed Defendant's conviction \n(COA #69039), and on April 6, 1984, the Michigan Supreme Court denied Defendant leave to \nappeal. (MSC #73947). \n3. Defendant's attorney at trial was Lawrence Greene; Defendant was rq>resented on appeal \nby Alvin C. Sallen. \n4.  Defendant had raised five issues on appeal, including challenges to the jury instructions \non alibi. the admission of uncbarged misconduct evidence, the admission of testimony to rebut the \nalibi defense. a claim that the identification procedures used were unduly suggestive, and a double \njeopardy challenge to the second conviction for criminal sexual conduct. \n5.  As shown below, the instant Motion for Relief from Judgment  alleges cause and \nprejudice establishing the following grounds for relief: \n(a)  At trial, the Victim, Suzanne Sizemore, positively identified Defendant as  the \nperpetrator. Testimony at trial also established that the Victim selected Defendant's \nphoto out of approximately 750 mug shot photos shown to her by police a week after \nthe crime and subsequently identified him in a live lineup. The investigating officer \nadmitted at trial that she informed the Victim that the person whose photo she \nselected from the stacks of mug shot photos would be in the live lineup. The Victim \nhad described the perpetrator to police immediately after the crime as 15-to-18 years \nof age, approximately 5'10\", with a thin to medium build, no facial hair, and with an \nunusual bair style of very small braids and \"poolS of hair.\" At the time of his arrest \nand Lineup, the Defendant was 21 years old, 5'9\", 135 Ibs, with a mature moustacbe \nand long sideburns, and shortly cropped hair.  In the course of articulating why her \ntestimony was believable, the prosecutor's closing argument noted that the Victim, \nSuzanne Sizemore, had picked Defendantout ofh undreds of mug shots she had seen, \nand that she had made no other identifications.  The Defendant presented a defense \nof mistaken identity and presented an alibi. \n(b)  In point of fact, unknown to the prosecutor. and undisclosed to the defense until its \nown investigation long after his conviction uncovered the evidence, the Victim had \nmade preliminary identifications of seven other potential suspects during herviewing \nof the mug shot photos.  Tbe original investigating officer decided that the next \nperson selected  by  the  Victim  would be  brought  in  for  an  in-person  lineup. \nDefendant was the next and eighth suspect selected.  The Victim did not make a \n\n. \n. \ndefinitive identification oftbe Defendant and did not place any additional emphasis \non Defendant's photo versus the other seven she had selected. This evidence was \npotentially exculpatory evidence which,  if known to the  prosecution. the trial \nprosecutor would have been duty-bound to disclose to the defense.  See, eg, Brady \nv Maryland, 373 US 83, 83 S Ct 1194, 10 L Ed 2d 21S (1963). \n(c)  The original investigating officer's misgivings about the ensuing identification led \nher to release the Defendant and schedule a polygraph examination; subsequently, \nthis examination was cancelled, Defendant was rearrested, and the officer was \nremoved from further responsibility for the case. \n(d)  Neither the investigating officer's misgivings, nor the cancellation of the polygraph. \nwere disclosed to the trial prosecutor or to the defense. \n(e)  One additional witness testified that Defendant was seen in the area at the time of the \ncrime. having made the identification at a lineup; no other witnesses were able to \nidentify Defendant. \n(f)  As  there  was  no  physical  evidence  connecting  Defendant  to  the  crime,  the \nprosecution's case depended entirely on the identification testimony of the victim and \nthe additional witness. \n(g)  Given the lack of corroborating evidence it appears that the Defendant would have \nhad  a  reasonably  likely  chance  of acquittal  had  the  evidence  of  previous \nidentifications,  and  the  random  nature  of the  corporeal  lineup  producing  the \neyewitness identifications, been disclosed to the defense before trial. \n(h)  Accordingly, it appears that Defendant bad \"good cause\" for failing to raise the point \npreviously.  and  has  suffered \"actual prejudice\"  within  the  meaning of MCR \n6.508(D)(3). \n6.  Accordingly. both parties believe that it would be in the interests ofj ustice for this Court \nto grant Defendant relief from judgment. \n\n: \nRELIEF \nWHEREFORE, this Court should grant Defendant relief from judgment. \nKYML WORTHY \nWayne County Prosecuting Atlorney \nTIMOTHY A.

Case No. 85-0376 \nHan. Leonard Townsend \nEDDIE JOE LLOYD, \nDefendant. \nJOINT MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT \nPURSUANT TO MCR 6.502 AND M.C.L. 770.16 \nThe People of the State of Michigan and the Detroit Police Department (Chief Jerry \nOliver) through Wayne County Prosecutor Michael E. Duggan, and defendant Eddie Joe \nLloyd through his attorney Barry Scheck, hereby move pursuant to MCR 6.502 and M.C.L. \n770.16 that defendant's judgment of conviction and sentence be vacated, and that this cause be \ndismissed without prejudice. \n1.  Defendant was tried by jury before this Honorable Court in case number 85-\n0376.  Defendant was convicted of first-degree felony murder. and was \nsentenced on May 21, 1985 by this Court to mandatory life.  He is currently \nconfined at the Southern Michigan Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan. \n2.  Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence as of right to the Michigan \nCourt of Appeals, file number 86045. The Court of Appeals affirmed \nI \n\n, \n• \ndefendant's conviction and sentence on July 16, 1987.  Defendant also \nrequested review by the Michigan Supreme Court pursuant to a letter request \nfor review under MeR 7.303 and a Delayed Application for Leave to Appeal, \nfile number 81349.  On January 29, 1988, defendant's letter was denied as \nmoot, and his application for leave to appeal was denied because the Court was \n\"not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by the Court.\" \nDefendant's motion for reconsideration was also denied by the Court on March \n28, 1988.  Defendant then petitioned the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan for a writ of babea s corpus, case number 88CV-733S1-\nDT.  Judge Julian A. Cook, Jr. dismissed defendant's petition on January 31, \n1989. \n3.  Defendant has been represented by four attorneys: (A) from preliminary \nexamination up to trial-Charles D. Lusby, 1575 E. Lafayette, Suite 205, \nDetroit, Michigan; (B) trial-Stanford M. Rubach (deceased), 49125 N. \nTerritorial, Plymouth, Michigan; (C) direct appeal-Robert E. Slameka, 163 \nMadison, Suite 101, Detroit, Michigan; and (D) proceedings under M.C.L. \n770.16 and motion for relief from judgment-Barry Scheck.  Attorney Lusby \nsuffered medical difficulties on the original trial date of April 22. 1985, and \nAttorney Rubach was appointed substitute counsel on April 24.  Defendant's \ntrial began on April 30 and concluded May 2. \n2 \n\n, \n, \n, \n• \n4.  The ground for relief contained in this pleading has not been raised before in \nany venue.  Additionally, defendant does not request the appointment of \ncounsel because he is currently represented. \n5.  The parties request that defendant's conviction and sentence be set aside, and \nthat the charges against defendant be dismissed without prejudice. \n6.  The ground for this request is that newly discovered evidence raises a \nreasonable doubt whether defendant is guilty of the crime for which he was \nconvicted and sentenced. \n7.  The facts supporting this ground for relief are as follows: On June 20, 2002, \nthe People received from defendant's attorney a DNA-testing report from \nForensic Science Associates excluding defendant as the source of spennatozoa \non three pieces of physical evidence recovered from the scene of victim \nMichelle Jackson's rape and murder.  These DNA results have since been \nindependently confmned by the Detroit Police Department and the Michigan \nState Police.  This DNA analysis was technologically unavailable in 1985, and \nin light of the evidence at that time the People's theory at trial was that \ndefendant was the sole perpetrator of this crime.  His exclusion as the source of \nspenn on the victim's thermal underwear, on a green bottle recovered from her \nrectum, and on paper attached to the green bottle, conclusively refute the \nPeople's trial theory. \n3 \n\n( \n8.  Only the perpetrator of the crime against Ms. Jackson could be the source of \nthe biological evidence found on the thetmal underwear, the bottle, and the \npaper. \n9.  The presence of another person's sperm on the underwear, bottle, and paper \n(and, as more recently discovered, in the victim's rectum)-coupled with the \nlack of proof of defendant's DNA on any other piece of crime·scene \nevidence-raises a reasonable doubt regarding defendant's guilt in this crime. \n10.  The parties agree that the underwear, bottle, paper, and anal slide were \ncollected, handled, and preserved by procedures that prevented them from \nbeing contaminated or unduly degraded. \n11.  The parties also agree that this new evidence, balanced against the evidence \nintroduced at trial, justifies the vacation of defendant's conviction and sentence \nand the dismissal of charges against him. \n12.  Finally. the parties agree that-due to the technological unavailability of this \nnew evidence until the present day-good cause exists to excuse defendant \nfrom not raising this issue in his prior appeals and post-conviction proceedings. \n4 \n\n· \n. \nRELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the People, the Detroit Police Department, and defendant request that \nthis Honorable Court vacate defendant's conviction and sentence, and dismiss this cause against \nhim without prejudice. \nRespectfully submitted, \nc \n0J1  42t----= \nMICHAEL E.

Advance Sheets Version \n \n \nBefore:  Murphy, P.J., and Sawyer and Whitbeck, JJ. \n \nMURPHY, P. J.   \n  At its core, this case involves a claim that the named plaintiffs, along with members of \nthe certified class, i.e., present and future indigent defendants subject to felony prosecutions in \nthe trial courts of Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon counties, have been, are being, and will be \ndenied their state and federal constitutional rights to counsel and the effective assistance of \ncounsel, Const 1963, art 1, § 20, and US Const, Am VI, directly as a result of the court-\nappointed, indigent defense systems currently being employed by those counties.  According to \nplaintiffs, even though the counties and the circuit court chief judges have been statutorily \ndelegated the duties associated with providing representation for indigent criminal defendants, \nthe  state  of  Michigan  and  the  Governor,  defendants  in  this  suit,  ultimately  remain  legally \nresponsible for securing and protecting the constitutional rights at issue.  And plaintiffs assert \nthat the constitutionally deficient county systems were born out of and created by defendants’ \ninadequate funding and lack of fiscal and administrative oversight.  They further allege that the \nsystemic constitutional deficiencies in regard to indigent representation continue to infect the \njudicial process and are directly attributable to defendants’ constitutional failures, which can and \nmust be redressed by court action.   \n  In Docket No. 278652, defendants appeal as of right the trial court’s order denying under \nMCR 2.116(C)(7) their motion for summary disposition based on governmental immunity.  In \nDocket No. 278858, defendants appeal by leave granted the trial court’s order denying their \nmotion for summary disposition on numerous theories, including various justiciability doctrines.  \nFinally,  in  Docket  No.  278860,  defendants  appeal  by  leave  granted  the  trial  court’s  order \ngranting class certification.  The appeals were consolidated. \n  We affirm, holding that defendants are not shielded by governmental immunity, that \ndefendants are proper parties, that the trial court, not the Court of Claims, has jurisdiction, and \nthat the trial court has jurisdiction and authority to order declaratory relief, prohibitory injunctive \nrelief, and some level of mandatory injunctive relief, the full extent of which we need not \npresently define.  We further hold that, on the basis of the pleadings and at this juncture in the \nlawsuit, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts that, if true, establish standing, establish that the \ncase is ripe for adjudication, and state claims upon which declaratory and injunctive relief can be \nawarded.  Finally, we hold that the trial court properly granted the motion for class certification. \n  We preface our opinion by observing that the role of the judiciary in our tripartite system \nof  government  entails,  in  part,  interpreting  constitutional  language,  applying  constitutional \nrequirements  to  the  given  facts  in  a  case,  safeguarding  constitutional  rights,  and  halting \n-2- \n\nunconstitutional conduct.  For state and federal constitutional provisions to have any meaning, \nwe  may  and  must  engage  in  this  role  even  where  litigation  encompasses  conduct  by  the \nexecutive and legislative branches.  We cannot accept the proposition that the constitutional \nrights of our citizens, even those accused of crimes and too poor to afford counsel, are not \ndeserving and worthy of any protection by the judiciary in a situation where the executive and \nlegislative branches fail to comply with constitutional mandates and abdicate their constitutional \nresponsibilities, either intentionally or neglectfully.  If not by the courts, then by whom?  We are \nnot ruling that a constitutional failure has in fact occurred here, but it has been alleged and needs \nto be judicially addressed.  This, however, does not mean that we may set public policy, make \npolitical judgments, or demand that more efficient or desirable means be utilized by the political \nbranches in carrying out their constitutional obligations.  But if a chosen path taken by the \nexecutive and legislative branches in an effort to satisfy their constitutional obligations allegedly \nfails to meet minimum constitutional requirements, the judiciary must examine the allegations \nand adjudicate the dispute.  The judiciary by so intervening is not acting with a lack of judicial \nmodesty  or  in  violation  of  the  separation  of  powers;  it  is  acting  in  accordance  with  its \nconstitutional obligations, duties, and oaths of office.  See Boumediene v Bush, 553 US __, __; \n128 S Ct 2229, 2259; 171 L Ed 2d 41, 77 (2008); Marbury v Madison, 5 US (1 Cranch) 137, \n177-180; 2 L Ed 60 (1803).  Failing to do so results in the political branches’ effectively deciding \n“what  the  law  is,”  Boumediene  and  Marbury,  supra,  impinging  on  the  judiciary’s  role  in \nviolation  of  the  separation  of  powers.    Judicial  modesty  does  not  equate  to  ignoring \nconstitutional obligations.  Constitutional compliance is our only concern; matters regarding the \nmethod and the manner by which the executive and legislative branches effectuate constitutional \ndemands are not our concern, nor can they be, as long as the branches abide by the state and \nfederal constitutions.  In that same vein, and with respect to the particular issues raised in this \naction, concerns about costs and fiscal impact, concerns regarding which governmental entity or \nentities should bear the costs, and concerns about which governmental body or bodies should \noperate an indigent defense system cannot be allowed to prevail over constitutional compliance, \ndespite any visceral reaction to the contrary.  We take no position on the validity of plaintiffs’ \nallegations and claims, nor are the underlying motivations of any party relevant.  We simply and \nmerely  hold  that  plaintiffs  have  alleged  facts  sufficient  to  survive  a  motion  for  summary \ndisposition. \nI.  The Complaint \n  In a highly detailed complaint, plaintiffs allege that the indigent defense systems now in \nplace in Berrien, Genesee, and Muskegon counties are underfunded, poorly administered, and do \nnot  ensure  that  the  participating  defense  attorneys  have  the  necessary  tools,  time,  and \nqualifications to adequately represent indigent defendants and to put the cases presented by \nprosecutors to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  Plaintiffs assert that the county \nsystems are wholly lacking with respect to the following: client eligibility standards; attorney \nhiring,  training,  and  retention  programs;  written  performance  and  workload  standards;  the \nmonitoring  and  supervision  of  appointed  counsel;  conflict  of  interest  guidelines;  and \nindependence from the judiciary and prosecutorial offices.  Plaintiffs claim harm in the form of \nimproperly  denied  representation,  wrongful  convictions,  unnecessary  or  prolonged  pretrial \ndetentions, factually unwarranted guilty pleas, lengthy pretrial delays, and the introduction of \ninadmissible evidence that could have been excluded had pretrial motions been filed.  Plaintiffs \nclaim further harm in the form of representation by counsel who have conflicts of interest, \n-3- \n\nsentences that are harsher than warranted or legally unsound, and hearing and trial failures due to \nunprepared counsel and the lack of inquiry, investigation, investigatory tools, and access to \nexpert witnesses.  The complaint provides numerous examples in support of these contentions. \n  The complaint proceeds to provide specific instances of alleged deficient and inadequate \nperformances by various court-appointed attorneys with respect to the eight named indigent \nplaintiffs.  As an overview, these alleged instances include: counsel speaking with plaintiffs, for \nthe first time, in holding cells for mere minutes before scheduled preliminary examinations while \nin  full  hearing  range  of  other  inmates;  counsel  advising  plaintiffs  to  waive  preliminary \nexaminations without meaningful discussions of case-relevant matters; counsel failing to provide \nplaintiffs with police reports; and counsel generally neglecting throughout the entire course of \ncriminal proceedings to discuss with plaintiffs the accuracy and nature of the charges, the \ncircumstances of the purported crimes, and any potential defenses.  Further alleged instances \ninclude:  counsel  entering  into  plea  negotiations  without  client  input  or  approval;  counsel \nperfunctorily advising plaintiffs to plead guilty as charged absent meaningful investigation and \ninquiry; counsel improperly urging plaintiffs to admit facts when pleas were taken; and counsel \nneither preparing for hearings and trials nor engaging in any communications with plaintiffs \nconcerning trials.  The complaint alleges that other indigent defendants being prosecuted or who \nwill be prosecuted in the future face the same prospects of receiving inadequate and ineffective \nassistance of counsel as that received by the named plaintiffs.   \n  With respect to all the named plaintiffs, as well as all those persons fitting within the \nclass, the complaint alleges that the inadequacies and ineffectiveness of counsel in handling \nindigent cases ultimately result from failures by the state and the Governor to adequately provide \nfunding and fiscal and administrative oversight.  According to plaintiffs, it is the failures by the \nstate and the Governor that have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause a denial of \nconstitutionally adequate legal representation within the systems employed by the counties.  \nCount I of the complaint, which pertains only to the Governor, alleges a Sixth Amendment \nviolation of the right to effective or adequate representation and seeks declaratory and injunctive \nrelief for the constitutional violation under 42 USC 1983.  Count II of the complaint, which also \npertains only to the Governor, alleges a Fourteenth Amendment violation of the right to due \nprocess and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief for the constitutional violation under 42 USC \n1983.   Count III of the complaint, which pertains to the Governor and the state, alleges a \nviolation of the right to the effective assistance of counsel under Const 1963, art 1, § 20, and \nseeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  Count IV of the complaint, which also pertains to the \nstate and the Governor, alleges a violation of due process under Const 1963, art 1, § 17, and \nseeks declaratory and injunctive relief. \n  In the prayer for relief, plaintiffs seek a court declaration that defendants’ conduct, failure \nto act, and practices are unconstitutional and unlawful, consistent with the four alleged counts, \nand  plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin  defendants  from  subjecting  class  members  to  continuing \nunconstitutional practices.  Plaintiffs also request an order requiring defendants “to provide \nindigent defense programs and representation consistent with the requirements of the United \nStates and Michigan Constitutions.” \n \n-4- \n\nII.  Class Certification and Summary Disposition \n  Pursuant to MCR 3.501(B), plaintiffs moved for class certification, contending that the \nclass was sufficiently numerous to the extent that joinder would be impractical, that factual and \nlegal issues raised by the named plaintiffs were common to, and typical of, prospective class \nmembers, that the named plaintiffs and prospective class members share or will share similar \nharms and constitutional deprivations, and that the named plaintiffs would fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class through maintenance of a class action, which would be superior \nto any other method of adjudication.   \n  Defendants filed a motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4), (7), \nand  (8).    Defendants  maintained  that  plaintiffs  lacked  standing,  the  case  was  not  ripe  for \nadjudication, the trial court lacked jurisdiction on a variety of grounds, there was a failure to state \na claim upon which declaratory and injunctive relief could be granted, the wrong parties were \nsued,  and  governmental  immunity  shielded  defendants  from  liability.    The  nature  of  each \nparticular argument will be discussed below in our analysis, given that defendants’ arguments \nwere renewed on appeal.  \n  At a hearing in which the trial court addressed plaintiffs’ motion for class certification as \nwell as defendants’ motion for summary disposition, the court granted class certification and \nrejected all the grounds raised by defendants in support of the summary disposition motion.  We \nshall discuss the court’s reasoning when we examine each of the appellate issues raised by \ndefendants.      \nIII.  Analysis \nA.  Standards of Review \n  This Court reviews de novo a trial court’s decision on a motion for summary disposition.  \nKreiner v Fischer, 471 Mich 109, 129; 683 NW2d 611 (2004).  Also reviewed de novo are issues \nof constitutional law, Wayne Co v Hathcock, 471 Mich 445, 455; 684 NW2d 765 (2004), \nstatutory interpretation, Feyz v Mercy Mem Hosp, 475 Mich 663, 672; 719 NW2d 1 (2006), \ngovernmental immunity, Bennett v Detroit Police Chief, 274 Mich App 307, 310-311; 732 \nNW2d 164 (2007), jurisdiction, Atchison v Atchison, 256 Mich App 531, 534; 664 NW2d 249 \n(2003), and matters concerning justiciability, Michigan Chiropractic Council v Comm’r of the \nOffice of Financial & Ins Services, 475 Mich 363, 369; 716 NW2d 561 (2006).      \n  “A  trial  court’s  ruling  regarding  certification  of  a  class  is  reviewed  for  clear  error, \nmeaning that the ruling will be found clearly erroneous only where there is no evidence to \nsupport it or there is evidence but this Court is nevertheless ‘left with a definite and firm \nconviction that a mistake has been made.’”  Hill v City of Warren, 276 Mich App 299, 310; 740 \nNW2d 706 (2007), quoting Zine v Chrysler Corp, 236 Mich App 261, 270; 600 NW2d 384 \n(1999).  \n \n \n-5- \n\nB.  Underlying Constitutional Principles \n1.  The Right to Counsel Generally \n  “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to . . . have the Assistance \nof  Counsel  for  his  defence.”    US  Const,  Am  VI.    The  right  to  counsel  under  the  Sixth \nAmendment  is  made  applicable  to  the  states  pursuant  to  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment.  People v Williams, 470 Mich 634, 641; 683 NW2d 597 (2004), citing \nGideon v Wainwright, 372 US 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963).  Under the Michigan \nConstitution, “[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right to . . . have the \nassistance of counsel for his or her defense[.]”  Const 1963, art 1, § 20.  Gideon made clear that \nthe indigent are constitutionally entitled to be represented by counsel when prosecuted for a \ncrime by the state, even though they lack the financial means to hire an attorney, and that the \nstate has an obligation to provide them counsel.  Gideon, supra at 344.  We wholeheartedly agree \nwith the following wise sentiments articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Gideon: \nThe assistance of counsel is one of the safeguards of the Sixth Amendment \ndeemed necessary to insure fundamental human rights of life and liberty. . . .  The \nSixth  Amendment  stands  as  a  constant  admonition  that  if  the  constitutional \nsafeguards it provides be lost, justice will not . . . be done. \n. . . [R]eason and reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary \nsystem of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a \nlawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This \nseems to us to be an obvious truth. Governments, both state and federal, quite \nproperly spend vast sums of money to establish machinery to try defendants \naccused  of  crime.  Lawyers  to  prosecute  are  everywhere  deemed  essential  to \nprotect  the  public’s  interest  in  an  orderly  society.  Similarly,  there  are  few \ndefendants charged with crime, few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they \ncan get to prepare and present their defenses. That government hires lawyers to \nprosecute and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are the \nstrongest indications of the widespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are \nnecessities, not luxuries. The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not \nbe deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in \nours. From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have \nlaid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure \nfair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before \nthe law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime \nhas  to  face  his  accusers  without  a  lawyer  to  assist  him.    [Id.  at  343-344 \n(parenthesis, citations, and quotation marks omitted; second ellipsis added).]  \n2.  The Right to the Effective Assistance of Counsel \n  The constitutional right to counsel encompasses the right to the effective assistance of \ncounsel.  Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668, 686; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984).  In \nUnited States v Cronic, 466 US 648, 654-656; 104 S Ct 2039; 80 L Ed 2d 657 (1984), the United \nStates Supreme Court explained: \n-6- \n\n  The special value of the right to the assistance of counsel explains why \n“[i]t has long been recognized that the right to counsel is the right to the effective \nassistance of counsel.” The text of the Sixth Amendment itself suggests as much. \nThe Amendment requires not merely the provision of counsel to the accused, but \n“Assistance,” which is to be “for his defence.” Thus, “the core purpose of the \ncounsel  guarantee  was  to  assure  ‘Assistance’  at  trial,  when  the  accused  was \nconfronted with both the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public \nprosecutor.” If no actual “Assistance” “for” the accused’s “defence” is provided, \nthen the constitutional guarantee has been violated. To hold otherwise “could \nconvert the appointment of counsel into a sham and nothing more than a formal \ncompliance with the Constitution’s requirement that an accused be given the \nassistance  of  counsel.  The  Constitution’s  guarantee  of  assistance  of  counsel \ncannot be satisfied by mere formal appointment.”  \n* * * \n  The substance of the Constitution’s guarantee of the effective assistance of \ncounsel is illuminated by reference to its underlying purpose. “[T]ruth,” Lord \nEldon  said,  “is  best  discovered  by  powerful  statements  on  both  sides  of  the \nquestion.” This dictum describes the unique strength of our system of criminal \njustice. “The very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that \npartisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective \nthat the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.” It is that “very premise” \nthat underlies and gives meaning to the Sixth Amendment.  It “is meant to assure \nfairness  in  the  adversary  criminal  process.”  Unless  the  accused  receives  the \neffective assistance of counsel, “a serious risk of injustice infects the trial itself.”  \n[Citations omitted.] \n3.  The Right to Counsel at Critical Stages of the Proceedings, Including Pretrial Stages \n  “The  Sixth  Amendment  safeguards  the  right  to  counsel  at  all  critical  stages  of  the \ncriminal process for an accused who faces incarceration.”  Williams, supra at 641.  A critical \nstage of the proceedings is any stage where the absence of counsel may harm a defendant’s right \nto a fair trial and “applies to preliminary proceedings where rights may be sacrificed or defenses \nlost.”  People v Green, 260 Mich App 392, 399; 677 NW2d 363 (2004), overruled on other \ngrounds People v Anstey, 476 Mich 436, 447 n 9 (2006).  Critical stages include, in part, the \npreliminary examination, Coleman v Alabama, 399 US 1, 9; 90 S Ct 1999; 26 L Ed 2d 387 \n(1970), a pretrial lineup, People v Frazier, 478 Mich 231, 249 n 20; 733 NW2d 713 (2007), and \nthe entry of a plea, People v Pubrat, 451 Mich 589, 593-594; 548 NW2d 595 (1996).  In Maine v \nMoulton, 474 US 159, 170; 106 S Ct 477; 88 L Ed 2d 481 (1985), the United States Supreme \nCourt observed: \n  [T]he Court has . . . recognized that the assistance of counsel cannot be \nlimited to participation in a trial; to deprive a person of counsel during the period \nprior to trial may be more damaging than denial of counsel during the trial itself. \nRecognizing that the right to the assistance of counsel is shaped by the need for \nthe  assistance  of  counsel,  we  have  found  that  the  right  attaches  at  earlier, \n-7- \n\n“critical” stages in the criminal justice process “where the results might well settle \nthe  accused’s  fate  and  reduce  the  trial  itself  to  a  mere  formality.”  And, \n“[w]hatever else it may mean, the right to counsel granted by the Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments means at least that a person is entitled to the help of a \nlawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against \nhim . . . .”  This is because, after the initiation of adversary criminal proceedings, \n“‘the government has committed itself to prosecute, and . . . the adverse positions \nof government and defendant have solidified. It is then that a defendant finds \nhimself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in \nthe intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.’”  [Citations omitted; \nemphasis and initial ellipsis added.] \n  When read together, the authorities cited above make abundantly clear that representation \nby counsel, and thus effective representation by counsel, is crucial in serving to protect Sixth \nAmendment rights not only at trial but also during pretrial proceedings.   \n4.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims in Criminal Appellate Proceedings \n  In the context of criminal cases and appeals, our Supreme Court in People v Carbin, 463 \nMich 590, 599-600; 623 NW2d 884 (2001), enunciated the basic and well-established principles \ninvolving a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel: \n  To  justify  reversal  under  either  the  federal  or  state  constitutions,  a \nconvicted defendant must satisfy the two-part test articulated by the United States \nSupreme Court in Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed \n2d 674 (1984).  See People v Pickens, 446 Mich 298, 302-303; 521 NW2d 797 \n(1994).    “First,  the  defendant  must  show  that  counsel’s  performance  was \ndeficient.  This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel \nwas  not  performing  as  the  ‘counsel’  guaranteed  by  the  Sixth  Amendment.”  \nStrickland, supra at 687.  In so doing, the defendant must overcome a strong \npresumption that counsel’s performance constituted sound trial strategy.  Id. at \n690.  “Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced \nthe defense.”  Id. at 687.  To demonstrate prejudice, the defendant must show the \nexistence of a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s error, the result of the \nproceeding would have been different.  Id. at 694.  “A reasonable probability is a \nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”  Id.  Because the \ndefendant  bears  the  burden  of  demonstrating  both  deficient  performance  and \nprejudice, the defendant necessarily bears the burden of establishing the factual \npredicate for his claim.  See People v Hoag, 460 Mich 1, 6; 594 NW2d 57 (1999). \n  Counsel’s performance is deemed deficient or ineffective when the “representation [falls] \nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.”  Strickland, supra at 688; People v Toma, 462 \nMich 281, 302; 613 NW2d 694 (2000).  The two-part Strickland test, cited in Carbin, takes \ncenter stage in addressing the justiciability claims, where defendants vigorously argue for its \napplication  in  this  civil  suit  seeking  declaratory  and  prospective  injunctive  relief.    In  our \njusticiability analysis, we will also explore the circumstances in which the prejudice prong of the \nStrickland test is inapplicable. \n-8- \n\nC.  Discussion \n1.  Governmental Immunity \n  Defendants argue that governmental immunity bars plaintiffs’ “tort” claims against the \nstate because they do not come within an exception to the broad grant of immunity afforded by \nMCL 691.1407(1).  Defendants also contend that absolute immunity bars plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst the Governor under MCL 691.1407(5).  The trial court ruled that governmental immunity \nis not available in a state court action alleging constitutional violations. \n  Under MCR 2.116(C)(7), summary disposition in favor of a defendant is proper when the \nplaintiff’s claim is “barred because of . . . immunity granted by law . . . .”  See Odom v Wayne \nCo, 482 Mich 459, 466; 760 NW2d 217 (2008).  The moving party may submit affidavits, \ndepositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence in support of the motion if substantively \nadmissible.  Id.  The contents of the complaint must be accepted as true unless contradicted by \nthe documentary evidence.  Id. \na.  The State \n  The governmental tort liability act (GTLA), MCL 691.1401 et seq., provides a broad \ngrant of immunity from “tort liability” to governmental agencies, absent the applicability of a \nstatutory exception,1 when they are engaged in the discharge or exercise of a governmental \nfunction.  MCL 691.1407(1); Maskery v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, 468 Mich 609, 613; \n664 NW2d 165 (2003); Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), 420 Mich 567, 595; 363 \nNW2d 641 (1984).  The state of Michigan is a “governmental agency” entitled to immunity as \ngranted under the GTLA.  MCL 691.1401(c) and (d).  An activity that is expressly or impliedly \nauthorized or mandated by constitution, statute, local charter, ordinance, or other law constitutes \na governmental function for purposes of the GTLA.  Maskery, supra at 613-614, quoting MCL \n691.1401(f).  This Court gives the term “governmental function” a broad interpretation, but the \nstatutory exceptions must be narrowly construed.  Maskery, supra at 614.  The “immunity \nprotects the state not only from liability, but also from the great public expense of having to \ncontest a trial.”  Odom, supra at 478.  The party that seeks to impose liability on a governmental \nentity has the burden of pleading in avoidance of governmental immunity.  Mack v Detroit, 467 \nMich 186, 198; 649 NW2d 47 (2002). \n  Here, there can be no reasonable dispute that the state was engaged in a governmental \nfunction when it delegated the representation of indigent defendants to the various counties.2  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 The statutory exceptions to governmental immunity consist of the highway exception, MCL \n691.1402,  the  proprietary-function  exception,  MCL  691.1413,  the  governmental-hospital \nexception, MCL 691.1407(4), the motor-vehicle exception, MCL 691.1405, the public-building \nexception, MCL 691.1406, and the sewage-disposal-system-event exception, MCL 691.1417(2).  \nOdom, supra at 478 n 62.   \n2 MCL 775.16 provides: \n(continued…) \n-9- \n\nMoreover, it is the state that is ultimately mandated to ensure that indigent defendants are \nprovided their constitutional right to counsel.  Gideon, supra; Williams, supra at 641. \n  Our  Supreme  Court  has  “observed  that  nontort  causes  of  action  are  not  barred  by \nimmunity if a plaintiff successfully pleads and establishes such a cause of action.”  Borg-Warner \nAcceptance Corp v Dep’t of State, 433 Mich 16, 19; 444 NW2d 786 (1989) (emphasis in \noriginal).   Further, in Smith v Dep’t of Pub Health, 428 Mich 540, 544; 410 NW2d 749 (1987), \naff’d sub nom Will v Michigan Dep’t of State Police, 491 US 58; (1989), the Michigan Supreme \nCourt held: \n[] Where it is alleged that the state, by virtue of custom or policy, has \nviolated a right conferred by the Michigan Constitution, governmental immunity \nis not available in a state court action. \n[] A claim for damages against the state arising from violation by the state \nof the Michigan Constitution may be recognized in appropriate cases.   \nSee also Jones v Powell, 462 Mich 329, 336; 612 NW2d 423 (2000). \n  State policies are at the forefront of this litigation.  “‘Governmental immunity is not \navailable in a state court action where it is alleged that the state has violated a right conferred by \nthe Michigan Constitution.’”  Hinojosa v Dep’t of Natural Resources, 263 Mich App 537, 546-\n547; 688 NW2d 550 (2004), quoting Burdette v Michigan, 166 Mich App 406, 408; 421 NW2d \n185 (1988).  An action that establishes unconstitutional conduct “may not be limited except as \nprovided by the Constitution because of the preeminence of the Constitution.”  Hinojosa, supra \nat 546, citing Smith, supra at 641 (opinion by Boyle, J.).  In Smith, id., Justice Boyle observed in \nher opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part: \nMCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) does not, by its terms, declare immunity \nfor  unconstitutional  acts  by  the  state.  The  idea  that  our  Legislature  would \nindirectly  seek to “approve” acts by the state which violate the state constitution \n \n  (…continued) \nWhen a person charged with having committed a felony appears before a \nmagistrate without counsel, and who has not waived examination on the charge \nupon which the person appears, the person shall be advised of his or her right to \nhave counsel appointed for the examination. If the person states that he or she is \nunable to procure counsel, the magistrate shall notify the chief judge of the circuit \ncourt in the judicial district in which the offense is alleged to have occurred, or the \nchief judge of the recorder’s court of the city of Detroit if the offense is alleged to \nhave occurred in the city of Detroit. Upon proper showing, the chief judge shall \nappoint or direct the magistrate to appoint an attorney to conduct the accused’s \nexamination and to conduct the accused’s defense. The attorney appointed by the \ncourt shall be entitled to receive from the county treasurer, on the certificate of the \nchief judge that the services have been rendered, the amount which the chief \njudge considers to be reasonable compensation for the services performed. \n-10- \n\nby cloaking such behavior with statutory immunity is too far-fetched to infer from \nthe language of MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107). We would not ascribe such a \nresult to our Legislature. \n  The Burdette panel reiterated those sentiments from Smith in addressing a due process \nchallenge, further reasoning: \n  Plaintiffs’ claim alleged that defendant violated plaintiffs’ due process \nrights under Const 1963, art 1, § 17. Plaintiffs have stated a prima facie claim. . . . \n[D]efendant cannot claim immunity where the plaintiff alleges that defendant has \nviolated its own constitution. Constitutional rights serve to restrict government \nconduct.  These  rights  would  never  serve  this  purpose  if  the  state  could  use \ngovernmental immunity to avoid constitutional restrictions. [Burdette, supra at \n408-409.] \n  The instant claims against the state are based solely on alleged violations of the Michigan \nConstitution and concern custom and policy matters with respect to the representation of indigent \ndefendants.    Moreover,  plaintiffs’  lawsuit  against  the  state  is  not  a  “tort  liability”  action.  \nAccordingly, the state is not shielded by immunity granted by law in this suit seeking declaratory \nand injunctive relief for constitutional violations.  The state, however, characterizes plaintiffs’ \nclaims as “constitutional tort” claims for money damages and thus claims that governmental \nimmunity bars the action.  The state argues that plaintiffs are actually seeking appropriations or \nmoney from the state treasury, making plaintiffs’ action one for money damages or monetary \nrelief.   A cause of action seeking money damages for a violation of state constitutional rights has \nbeen coined a “state constitutional tort action.”  See Jones v Sherman, 243 Mich App 611, 612; \n625 NW2d 391 (2000).  Typically, a constitutional tort claim arises when a governmental \nemployee, exercising discretionary powers, violates constitutional rights personal to a plaintiff.  \nReid v Michigan, 239 Mich App 621, 629; 609 NW2d 215 (2000).   \n  We initially note that, as indicated above, “[a] claim for damages against the state arising \nfrom violation by the state of the Michigan Constitution may be recognized in appropriate \ncases.”    Smith,  supra  at  544;  see  also  Powell,  supra  at  336.    Nevertheless,  defendants \ninaccurately characterize plaintiffs’ claims, where the gravamen of the lawsuit concerns the \nadequacy of representation for indigent defendants and prays for equitable relief; this is not a tort \nliability action for money damages, nor do plaintiffs request an appropriation of state funds.   \nPlaintiffs seek a court declaration that defendants’ practices are unconstitutional, seek to enjoin \ncontinuing unconstitutional practices, and seek to compel the state and the Governor to provide \nindigent defendants representation consistent with the state and federal constitutions.  Assuming \nthat the state would incur an unfavorable fiscal impact as the ultimate result of the proceedings, it \ndoes not magically transform the case, for purposes of the GTLA, from an equitable action into a \ntort liability action seeking a money judgment or monetary relief.  See, e.g., Edelman v Jordan, \n415 US 651, 666-668; 94 S Ct 1347; 39 L Ed 2d 662 (1974) (a fiscal consequence to state \ntreasuries resulting from compliance with equitable decrees, which by their terms are prospective \nin nature, is an ancillary effect and does not mean that a money judgment had been entered).  The \nstate has cited no convincing or even relevant authority making the GTLA applicable in this \nequitable action.  Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that governmental immunity is \nnot available to the state.    \n-11- \n\nb.  The Governor \n  With respect to the Governor, MCL 691.1407(5) provides: \n  A judge, a legislator, and the elective or highest appointive executive \nofficial of all levels of government are immune from tort liability for injuries to \npersons or damages to property if he or she is acting within the scope of his or her \njudicial, legislative, or executive authority.  [Emphasis added.] \n  “The executive power is vested in the governor[,]” Const 1963, art 5, § 1; therefore, there \ncan  be  no  dispute  that  the  Governor  is  the  highest  executive  official  in  state  government.  \nAdditionally,  this  lawsuit  necessarily  relates  to  duties  within  the  scope  of  the  Governor’s \nexecutive  authority,  given  that  “[t]he  governor  shall  take  care  that  the  laws  be  faithfully \nexecuted[,]” Const 1963, art 5, § 8.  Further, in regard to the scope of executive authority, this \nsuit potentially affects issues of state funding, and Const 1963, art 5, § 18, provides that “[t]he \ngovernor shall submit to the legislature at a time fixed by law, a budget for the ensuing fiscal \nperiod setting forth in detail, for all operating funds, the proposed expenditures and estimated \nrevenue of the state.”  However, for the reasons stated earlier in this opinion with respect to the \nstate, this is not a tort liability action seeking money damages.  Accordingly, MCL 691.1407(5) \nprovides no immunity for the Governor. \n2.  Jurisdiction and Authority to Order Various Forms of Injunctive Relief \na.  Mandamus and the Governor \n  Defendants  argue,  in  cursory  fashion,  that  the  trial  court  lacks  jurisdiction  to  order  \ninjunctive relief with respect to the Governor.  On this issue, the trial court ruled that Michigan \nlaw cannot immunize the Governor from federal claims under preemption principles and that the \nGovernor is not immune from state law claims because the suit does not entail tort liability.  As \nis evident, the trial court somewhat treaded on governmental immunity principles discussed \nearlier in this opinion.   \n  In support of their contention that injunctive relief cannot issue against the Governor, \ndefendants cite only Straus v Governor, 459 Mich 526, 532-533; 592 NW2d 53 (1999), in which \nthe Supreme Court, quoting and adopting this Court’s opinion in the case, stated: \n“We would also note that, because a court at all times is required to \nquestion sua sponte its own jurisdiction (whether over a person, the subject matter \nof an action, or the limits on the relief it may afford), we have some doubt with \nrespect to the propriety of injunctive relief against the Governor. It is clear that \nseparation  of  powers  principles,  Const  1963,  art  3,  § 2,  preclude  mandatory \ninjunctive relief, mandamus, against the Governor. Whether similar reasoning \nalso puts prohibitory injunctive relief beyond the competence of the judiciary \nappears to be an open question that need not be resolved in this case. We do note \nthat the Supreme Court has recently recognized that declaratory relief normally \nwill  suffice  to  induce  the  legislative  and  executive  branches,  the  principal \nmembers of which have taken oaths of fealty to the constitution identical to that \ntaken  by  the  judiciary,  Const  1963,  art  11,  § 1,  to  conform  their  actions  to \n-12- \n\nconstitutional requirements or confine them within constitutional limits. Only \nwhen  declaratory  relief  has  failed  should  the  courts  even  begin  to  consider \nadditional forms of relief in these situations.  The need for utmost delicacy on the \npart of the judiciary, and respect for the unique office of Governor, [has been] \nrecognized [by this Court.]”  [Citations omitted.] \n  In part, plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, and the quoted passage from Straus makes clear \nthat the courts have the authority to issue a declaratory judgment against the Governor, which \nshould be the first course of action before even contemplating injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs also \nseek to enjoin continuing unconstitutional practices or, stated otherwise, prohibitory injunctive \nrelief.  Such a remedy could potentially entail a cessation of criminal prosecutions against \nindigent defendants absent constitutional compliance with the right to counsel.  Straus indicates \nthat the Court was not resolving the question whether the judiciary is constrained from ordering \nprohibitory injunctive relief against the Governor and, given that defendants do not present any \nadditional arguments on the issue, we decline to find that the trial court lacks authority or \njurisdiction to enjoin the Governor from continuing unconstitutional practices.  In regard to the \nissue of mandatory injunctive relief (mandamus), plaintiffs do seek to compel the Governor to \nprovide indigent defendants with representation that is consistent with the state and federal \nconstitutions.  As will be discussed later in this opinion, we believe that there may exist a basis to \nsubject the Governor to a mandamus order under Michigan law in regard to state constitutional \nviolations if this case reflects the existence of impediments to the ability of the judiciary to carry \nout its duties in compliance with constitutional principles relative to indigent defendants being \nprosecuted in state courtrooms.  However, we need not specifically answer the question because \nthe Governor is also being sued for alleged federal constitutional violations under 42 USC 1983, \nwhich allows for mandatory injunctive relief.3  A review of Straus reveals that it did not involve \na claim brought under 42 USC 1983 alleging a violation of a federal constitutional right.  42 \nUSC 1983 provides, in relevant part:   \n  Every  person  who,  under  color  of  any  statute,  ordinance,  regulation, \ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, \nor causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within \nthe jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an \naction at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in \nany action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such \nofficer’s  judicial  capacity,  injunctive  relief  shall  not  be  granted  unless  a \n \n                                                 \n \n3 “[T]he Michigan Constitution does not afford greater protection than federal precedent with \nregard to a defendant’s right to counsel when it involves a claim of ineffective assistance of \ncounsel.”  Pickens, supra at 302.  Plaintiffs’ request for mandamus-type relief encompasses, \nwithout distinction, both the alleged state and the alleged federal constitutional deprivations; \ntherefore, considering that the federal constitutional rights parallel those under the Michigan \nConstitution, if there is a state violation, there would be a federal violation, implicating relief \nunder 42 USC 1983. \n-13- \n\ndeclaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.  [Emphasis \nadded.]   \n  Even though a state official is a “person” in the literal sense, “a suit against a state official \nin his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the \nofficial’s office[, and,] [a]s such, it is no different from a suit against the State itself.”  Will v \nMichigan Dep’t of State Police, 491 US 58, 71; 109 S Ct 2304; 105 L Ed 2d 45 (1989) (citations \nomitted).  However, “a state official in his or her official capacity, when sued for injunctive \nrelief, would be a person under § 1983 because ‘official-capacity actions for prospective relief \nare not treated as actions against the State.’”  Will, supra at 71 n 10, quoting Kentucky v Graham, \n473 US 159, 167 n 14; 105 S Ct 3099; 87 L Ed 2d 114 (1985), and citing Ex parte Young, 209 \nUS 123, 159-160; 28 S Ct 441; 52 L Ed 714 (1908); see also Hafer v Melo, 502 US 21, 27; 112 S \nCt 358; 116 L Ed 2d 301 (1991).   The suit against the Governor qualifies as an official-capacity \nsuit, id. at 24, 27, and the action seeks equitable relief in the form of a declaratory judgment and \nan injunction, thereby providing prospective relief.  The Governor can thus be sued for injunctive \nrelief under 42 USC 1983, which makes clear that equitable relief is available for a federal \nconstitutional violation and that, if there is any limitation on granting injunctive relief, the \nlimitation pertains only to judicial officers.  See Van Orden v Perry, 545 US 677; 125 S Ct 2854; \n162 L Ed 2d 607 (2005) (Texas resident commenced § 1983 action against the governor and \nother state officials, seeking declaratory relief and an injunction that would require the removal \nof the Ten Commandments from the capitol on the basis of an Establishment Clause violation).  \nThere is no language in 42 USC 1983 suggesting that equitable relief in the form of a mandatory \ninjunction or mandamus is not available against the Governor, or that there is a distinction to be \nmade between prohibitory injunctive relief and mandatory injunctive relief.   \n  In Felder v Casey, 487 US 131, 139; 108 S Ct 2302; 101 L Ed 2d 123 (1988), the United \nStates Supreme Court made clear the broad reach of a § 1983 action, stating: \nSection 1983 creates a species of liability in favor of persons deprived of \ntheir federal civil rights by those wielding state authority. As we have repeatedly \nemphasized,  “the  central  objective  of  the  Reconstruction-Era  civil  rights \nstatutes . . . is to ensure that individuals whose federal constitutional or statutory \nrights  are  abridged  may  recover  damages  or  secure  injunctive  relief.”  Thus, \n§ 1983 provides “a uniquely federal remedy against incursions . . . upon rights \nsecured by the Constitution and laws of the Nation,” and is to be accorded “a \nsweep as broad as its language.”  \nAny assessment of the applicability of a state law to federal civil rights \nlitigation, therefore, must be made in light of the purpose and nature of the federal \nright. This is so whether the question of state-law applicability arises in § 1983 \nlitigation brought in state courts, which possess concurrent jurisdiction over such \nactions, or in federal-court litigation, where, because the federal civil rights laws \nfail  to  provide  certain  rules  of  decision  thought  essential  to  the  orderly \nadjudication of rights, courts are occasionally called upon to borrow state law.  \nAccordingly, we have held that a state law that immunizes government conduct \notherwise subject to suit under § 1983 is preempted, even where the federal civil \nrights litigation takes place in state court, because the application of the state \n-14- \n\nimmunity law would thwart the congressional remedy, which of course already \nprovides certain immunities for state officials.  [Citations omitted; ellipses in \noriginal.] \n  Accordingly, any state law (statutory, constitutional, or common law) that can be read to \nexclude  the  Governor  from  being  compelled  to act,  or  otherwise  subjected  to  any  type  of \ninjunction, is preempted when a suit for equitable relief is brought against the Governor pursuant \nto 42 USC 1983 for violation of the federal constitution, regardless of the fact that the suit is \nlitigated in a state court.   \nb.  Appropriations from the State Treasury \n  Defendants also argue that only the Legislature, as opposed to the trial court or any court, \nhas the authority or jurisdiction to appropriate funds from the state treasury.  In support of their \nposition, defendants rely on Musselman v Governor, 448 Mich 503; 533 NW2d 237 (1995).  In \nMusselman, the plaintiffs, current and retired public school employees who were members of the \nMichigan Public School Employees Retirement System, alleged that the state had failed to fund \nretirement health care benefits being earned by employees, thereby violating Const 1963, art 9, \n§ 24.  The plaintiffs sought a “writ of mandamus ordering the appropriate official to transfer \nfunds from the school aid fund to the reserve for health benefits.”  Musselman, supra at 521.  \nOur Supreme Court held that the state was constitutionally “obligated to prefund health care \nbenefits under art 9, § 24.”  Musselman, supra at 524.  The Court, however, denied mandamus, \nruling that it had “no authority to order the Governor or the Legislature to appropriate funds[.]”  \nId.  The Musselman Court reasoned: \nGiven that the plaintiffs have failed to show that there is a pool of funds \navailable to be transferred to the reserve for health benefits, the requested relief \nnecessarily involves funds from the state treasury.  The only defendant with \nauthority to appropriate funds from the treasury is the Legislature. “No money \nshall be paid out of the state treasury except in pursuance of appropriations made \nby law.” Const 1963, art 9, § 17. \nIn this context, this Court lacks the power to require the Legislature to \nappropriate funds. This was the understanding of the drafters of art 9, § 24, who \nlikewise did not contemplate that the prefunding requirement could be enforced \nby a court. They expected that the decision to comply rested ultimately with the \nLegislature, whom the people would have to trust[.]  [Musselman, supra at 522.][4] \n \n                                                 \n \n4 The Supreme Court subsequently granted rehearing and issued Musselman v Governor (On \nRehearing), 450 Mich 574, 576-577; 545 NW2d 346 (1996), wherein the former majority of four \nin the case lost Chief Justice Brickley who decided that it was unnecessary to construe Const \n1963, art 9, § 24, because mandamus could not ultimately issue to order the appropriation or \ntransfer of funds.  Thus, while there was no longer a majority regarding interpretation of Const \n1963, art 9, § 24, there still remained a majority rejecting a mandamus remedy.  See Studier v \n(continued…) \n-15- \n\n  It appears to us that equally problematic would be a court order directing the enactment \nof legislation or administrative rules, or the issuance of executive or administrative orders, in \norder to correct any constitutional deficiencies in the court-appointed, indigent defense systems.  \nSee Const 1963, art 4, § 1 (“The legislative power of the State of Michigan is vested in a senate \nand a house of representatives.”); Const 1963, art 5, § 17 (“The governor shall communicate by \nmessage to the legislature at the beginning of each session and may at other times present to the \nlegislature information as to the affairs of the state and recommend measures he considers \nnecessary or desirable.).5     \n  Here,  again,  plaintiffs  seek  a  court  declaration  that  defendants’  practices  are \nunconstitutional,  seek  to  enjoin  continuing  unconstitutional  practices,  and  seek  to  compel \ndefendants to provide indigent defendants representation consistent with the state and federal \nconstitutions.  In the prayer for relief, plaintiffs are not expressly seeking an appropriation or \ntransfer of state funds, nor expressly demanding the enactment of legislation.  We acknowledge \nthat plaintiffs allege that the systemic constitutional deficiencies have been caused by inadequate \nstate funding and the lack of fiscal and administrative oversight.  We further recognize that, \nshould plaintiffs prevail, funding and legislation would seemingly appear to be the measures  \nneeded to be taken to correct constitutional violations.  However, we are not prepared to rule on \nthe  issue  whether  the  trial  court  has  the  authority  to  order  appropriations,  legislation,  or \ncomparable steps.   It is unnecessary to do so at this juncture in the proceedings. \n  There is no dispute that declaratory relief is an available remedy falling within the trial \ncourt’s  jurisdiction  and  authority.    As  indicated  in  Straus,  supra  at  532,  “‘[o]nly  when \ndeclaratory  relief  has  failed  should  the  courts  even  begin  to  consider  additional  forms  of \nrelief[.]’”  (Citation omitted.)  With respect to the state constitutional claims, which are the only \nclaims brought against the state, should plaintiffs prevail, declaratory relief alone needs to be \ninitially  contemplated.    And  if  the  state  takes  corrective  action  without  further  need  for \nintervention  by  the  trial  court,  injunctive  relief  and  the  authority  to  issue  constitutionally \nquestionable forms of such relief would no longer be at issue.  Additionally, while 42 USC 1983 \ndoes not place a limit on a court to first attempt resolution through a declaratory judgment alone, \nit is possible that upon entry of a declaratory judgment, the Governor would take corrective \nmeasures to comply with constitutional requirements.6  Accordingly, the issue of injunctive relief \nmay never come to fruition.   \n  Furthermore, defendants do not argue that the trial court lacks authority or jurisdiction to \nenjoin them from continuing unconstitutional practices; therefore, there is the potential that \n \n  (…continued) \nMichigan Pub School Employees’ Retirement Bd, 472 Mich 642, 650-659; 698 NW2d 350 \n(2005) (discussing the Musselman cases and resolving the open issue regarding construction of \nConst 1963, art 9, § 24).     \n5 “While strong arguments can be made that state funding would be a more desirable system of \ncourt financing, it is for the Legislature to determine whether to adopt such a system.”  Grand \nTraverse Co v Michigan, 450 Mich 457, 472; 538 NW2d 1 (1995).   \n6 The trial court would necessarily enter a declaratory judgment before, or contemporaneous \nwith, the entry of an order granting injunctive relief. \n-16- \n\nconstitutional compliance could occur through issuance of prohibitory injunctive relief, without \nreaching  questions  concerning  mandatory  injunctive  relief  or  mandamus  or  compelling \ndefendants to act by way of appropriations or legislation.           \n  Additionally,  other  than  defendants’  argument  that  injunctive  relief  can  never  issue \nagainst the Governor, which argument we rejected earlier in this opinion, defendants do not \ncontend that the judiciary lacks the authority or jurisdiction to enter an order compelling, in \nbroad  and  general  terms,  compliance  with  constitutional  mandates.    Defendants’  argument \nmerely decries court intervention in the appropriation of funds from the state treasury.  However, \nthe  entry  of  an  order  simply  compelling  the  state  and  the  Governor  to  provide  indigent \ndefendants representation consistent with the state and federal constitutions does not necessarily \nmean that the state is being required by the court to appropriate funds to come into compliance.  \nTheoretically, there may be creative alternatives available to satisfy constitutional mandates \nconcerning the right to counsel.    \n  We can only speculate at this time regarding the measures ultimately needed to be taken \nin order to come into compliance with the state and federal constitutions, assuming plaintiffs \nestablish their case.7  Only when all other possibilities are exhausted and explored, as already \ndiscussed, does there arise issues regarding appropriations and legislation, the separation of \npowers, and the full extent of court jurisdiction and authority.  Therefore, we find no need at this \ntime for this Court to conclusively addressed the questions posed.  That being said, we wish to \nmake clear that nothing in this opinion should be read as foreclosing entry of an order granting \nthe type of relief so vigorously challenged by defendants.  We take that stand for two reasons.  \nFirst,  unlike  in  Musselman,  federal  constitutional  violations  are  alleged  here  and  brought \npursuant to 42 USC 1983.  In the context of federal law, and keeping in mind the broad reach of \na § 1983 action, we note the following passage from the United States Supreme Court’s decision \nin Edelman, supra at 667-668: \n  As in most areas of the law, the difference between the type of relief \nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted under Ex parte Young will \nnot in many instances be that between day and night.  The injunction issued in Ex \nparte Young was not totally without effect on the State’s revenues, since the state \nlaw which the Attorney General was enjoined from enforcing provided substantial \nmonetary penalties against railroads which did not conform to its provisions.  \n \n                                                 \n \n7 The dissent indicates that this litigation will inevitably superimpose a statewide and state-\nfunded system for the representation of indigent criminal defendants.  There is, however, no \ncertainty that this will occur, even if it may be a goal of plaintiffs.  The dissent jumps ahead to an \nenvisioned  remedy,  where  plaintiffs  have  not  proven,  nor  even  tried  their  case  yet,  where \nlegislative or congressional action on the issue, which has received much attention as of late, \ncould conceivably occur before and regardless of this litigation, and where other avenues of \nconstitutional  compliance  have  not  been  explored,  given  the  stage  of  the  proceedings.  \nUltimately, and again assuming plaintiffs are successful, constitutional compliance could come \nin any variety or combination of forms.  Our overriding concern is constitutionality, not the \nchosen path by which constitutional compliance is achieved.         \n-17- \n\nLater cases from this Court have authorized equitable relief which has probably \nhad greater impact on state treasuries than did that awarded in Ex parte Young.  In \nGraham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 [29 L Ed 2d 534; 91 S Ct 1848] (1971), \nArizona and Pennsylvania welfare officials were prohibited from denying welfare \nbenefits to otherwise qualified recipients who were aliens.  In Goldberg v. Kelly, \n397 U.S. 254 [90 S Ct 1011; 25 L Ed 2d 287] (1970), New York City welfare \nofficials  were  enjoined  from  following  New  York  State  procedures  which \nauthorized the termination of benefits paid to welfare recipients without prior \nhearing.  But the fiscal consequences to state treasuries in these cases were the \nnecessary  result  of  compliance  with  decrees  which  by  their  terms  were \nprospective in nature.  State officials, in order to shape their official conduct to \nthe mandate of the Court’s decrees, would more likely have to spend money from \nthe state treasury than if they had been left free to pursue their previous course of \nconduct.  Such an ancillary effect on the state treasury is a permissible and often \nan inevitable consequence of the principle announced in Ex parte Young, supra.  \n[Emphasis added.] \n  Our second reason for not accepting outright defendants’ arguments is the Michigan \nSupreme Court’s decision in 46th Circuit Trial Court v Crawford Co, 476 Mich 131; 719 NW2d \n553 (2006).  The case involved “a conflict between the legislative branch’s exercise of the \n‘legislative power’ to appropriate and to tax, and the judicial branch’s inherent power to compel \nsufficient appropriations to allow the judiciary to carry out its essential judicial functions.”  Id. at \n134.  The plaintiff trial court sought to compel “counties to appropriate funding for the enhanced \npension and retiree health care plans it deem[ed] necessary to recruit and retain adequate staff to \nallow it to carry out its essential judicial functions.”  Id.   \n  The Supreme Court indicated that the judiciary has the extraordinary and inherent power \nto compel funding, which power is derived from the separation of powers set forth in articles 4 \nthrough 6 and article 3, § 2, of the 1963 Michigan Constitution.  46th Circuit Trial Court at 140-\n141.  The Court explained: \n[J]ust as it is implicit in the separation of powers that each branch of \ngovernment is empowered to carry out the entirety of its constitutional powers, \nand  only  these  powers,  it  is  also  implicit  that  each  branch  must  be  allowed \nadequate resources to carry out its powers. Although the allocation of resources \nthrough the appropriations and taxing authorities lies at the heart of the legislative \npower, and thus belongs to the legislative branch, in those rare instances in which \nthe legislature’s allocation of resources impacts the ability of the judicial branch \nto carry out its constitutional responsibilities, what is otherwise exclusively a part \nof the legislative power becomes, to that extent, a part of the judicial power. . . . \nIn  order  for  the  judicial  branch  to  carry  out  its  constitutional \nresponsibilities as envisioned by Const 1963, art 3, § 2, the judiciary cannot be \ntotally beholden to legislative determinations regarding its budgets. While the \npeople of this state have the right to appropriations and taxing decisions being \nmade by their elected representatives in the legislative branch, they also have the \n-18- \n\nright  to  a  judiciary  that  is  funded  sufficiently  to  carry  out  its  constitutional \nresponsibilities. \nThus, the judiciary’s “inherent power” to compel appropriations sufficient \nto enable it to carry out its constitutional responsibilities is a function of the \nseparation of powers provided for in the Michigan Constitution. The “inherent \npower” does not constitute an exception to the separation of powers; rather, it is \nintegral  to  the  separation  of  powers  itself.  What  is  exceptional  about  the \njudiciary’s “inherent power” is its distinctiveness from more traditional exercises \nof the judicial power, involving as it does determinations that directly implicate \nthe appropriations power. \nHowever, in order to accommodate this distinctive, and extraordinary, \njudicial power with the normal primacy of the legislative branch in determining \nlevels  of  appropriations,  the  “inherent  power”  has  always  been  sharply \ncircumscribed.  The  “inherent  power”  contemplates  only  the  power,  when  an \nimpasse has arisen between the legislative and judicial branches, to determine \nlevels  of  appropriation  that  are  “reasonable  and  necessary”  to  enable  the \njudiciary  to  carry  out  its  constitutional  responsibilities.  However,  levels  of \nappropriation  that  are  optimally  required  for  the  judiciary  remain  always \ndeterminations within the legislative power.  [46th Circuit Trial Court at 142-144 \n(emphasis added and in original).] \n  If indeed there exist systemic constitutional deficiencies in regard to the right to counsel \nand the right to the effective assistance of counsel, it is certainly arguable that 46th Circuit Trial \nCourt lends authority for a court to order defendants to provide funding at a level that is \nconstitutionally satisfactory.  The state of Michigan has an obligation under Gideon to provide \nindigent defendants with court-appointed counsel, and the “state” is comprised of three branches, \nincluding the judiciary.  Const 1963, art 3, § 2.  Ultimately, it is the judiciary, on a daily basis, \nthat  is  integrally  involved  with  ensuring  that,  before  prosecutions  go  forward,  indigent \ndefendants are provided counsel, without which the court could not carry out its constitutional \nresponsibilities.  Musselman did not entail the constitutional implications that arise here, which \ninclude the ability of the judicial branch to carry out its functions in a constitutionally sound \nmanner. \n  In sum, we reiterate that we decline at this time to define the full extent of the trial court’s \nequitable authority and jurisdiction beyond that recognized and accepted earlier in this opinion.8 \n \n                                                 \n \n8 We have ruled that declaratory relief is available and we have ruled that prohibitory injunctive \nrelief is available, assuming establishment of plaintiffs’ case, both remedies being requested by \nplaintiffs.  It is true that we have not set boundaries with respect to mandatory injunctive relief; \nhowever, as already indicated, Straus dictates that restraint be exercised if and until declaratory \nrelief fails to accomplish constitutional compliance.  Moreover, our decision not to set the \nparameters relative to mandatory injunctive relief cannot serve as a basis to dismiss the action, \n(continued…) \n-19- \n\n3.  Jurisdiction: Court of Claims versus the Circuit Court \n  Defendants contend that the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over this case.  \nThe trial court determined that defendants had relied on cases involving tort claims for money \ndamages in making this jurisdictional argument and, because plaintiffs are seeking prospective \nrelief that is purely equitable, the case did not belong in the Court of Claims. \n  MCL 600.6419 provides in pertinent part: \n  (1) Except as provided in [MCL 600.6419a] and [MCL 600.6440], the \njurisdiction of the court of claims, as conferred upon it by this chapter, shall be \nexclusive. . . . The court has power and jurisdiction: \n  (a)  To  hear  and  determine  all  claims  and  demands,  liquidated  and \nunliquidated,  ex  contractu  and  ex  delicto,  against  the  state  and  any  of  its \ndepartments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms, or agencies. \n* * * \n  (4)  This  chapter  shall  not  deprive  the  circuit  court  of  this  state  of \njurisdiction over . . . proceedings for declaratory or equitable relief, or any other \nactions against state agencies based upon the statutes of this state in such case \nmade and provided, which expressly confer jurisdiction thereof upon the circuit \ncourt . . . . \n  To  interpret  MCL  600.6419  correctly,  it  must  be  read  in  conjunction  with  MCL \n600.6419a, which provides, in full: \n  In addition to the powers and jurisdiction conferred upon the court of \nclaims by section 6419, the court of claims has concurrent jurisdiction of any \ndemand for equitable relief and any demand for a declaratory judgment when \nancillary to a claim filed pursuant to section 6419.  The jurisdiction conferred by \nthis section is not intended to be exclusive of the jurisdiction of the circuit court \nover demands for declaratory and equitable relief conferred by [MCL 600.605]. \n  In Parkwood Ltd Dividend Housing Ass’n v State Housing Dev Auth, 468 Mich 763, 775; \n664 NW2d 185 (2003), our Supreme Court construed these provisions and held: \n  Today we hold that pursuant to the plain language of § 6419(1)(a), the \nCourt of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over complaints based on contract or \ntort that seek solely declaratory relief against the state or any state agency. We \ndisavow any contrary statements found in our prior case law that have seemingly \ninterpreted § 6419(1)(a) as granting the Court of Claims jurisdiction over claims \nfor money damages only.  \n \n  (…continued) \ngiven that other relief is available.   \n-20- \n\n  Consistent with our discussion earlier in this opinion, plaintiffs’ complaint is not based on \ntort, and it is indisputable that it is not based on contract.  The Parkwood Court interpreted MCL \n600.6419(4) “as maintaining the jurisdiction of the circuit court over those declaratory claims \nagainst the state that do not involve contract or tort.”  Parkwood, supra at 774 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court further stated: \n  This jurisdiction of the circuit court is concurrent with the jurisdiction of \nthe Court of Claims over such claims in the circumstances set out in § 6419a, see \nn 7. That is, when such a declaratory action is ancillary to another claim within \nthe Court of Claims exclusive jurisdiction under § 6419, the circuit court and the \nCourt  of  Claims  have  concurrent  jurisdiction  over  the  declaratory  action.  \n[Parkwood, supra at 774 n 10.] \nFootnote 7 in Parkwood, supra at 772, referenced in the preceding quotation, provides: \n  We construe the enactment of § 6419a as having added to this jurisdiction \nby clarifying that the Court of Claims also has jurisdiction over other declaratory \nand equitable claims, specifically, those that relate neither to contract nor tort—\nover which the circuit court would otherwise have exclusive jurisdiction—when \nthose claims are ancillary to a claim within the court’s exclusive jurisdiction \nunder § 6419.  [Emphasis in original.] \n  Thus, the Court of Claims, while having exclusive jurisdiction over complaints based on \ncontract  or  tort  that  seek  solely  declaratory  relief  against  the  state,  also  has  concurrent \njurisdiction over complaints seeking declaratory and equitable relief not based on tort or contract \nif ancillary to a contract or tort claim.  Because there is no contract or tort claim whatsoever here, \nthe Court of Claims has neither exclusive nor concurrent jurisdiction.  The trial court did not err \nby ruling that the instant case does not belong in the Court of Claims. \n4.  Proper Parties to the Litigation \n  Defendants argue that the action should have been filed against the judiciary and the \ncounties that administer the indigent criminal defense systems.  The trial court found that even \nthough defendants have essentially delegated their constitutional duties to the counties, it does \nnot ultimately relieve defendants of their constitutional responsibilities.  \n  Under  MCL  775.16,  a  circuit  court’s  chief  judge  is  responsible  for  procuring \nrepresentation for indigent defendants and county treasurers are obligated to pay reasonable \ncompensation to appointed attorneys.  In re Recorder’s Court Bar Ass’n v Wayne Circuit Court, \n443 Mich 110, 122; 503 NW2d 885 (1993).  However, it would be erroneous to assume “that the \nstatutory purpose underlying assigned counsels’ right to reasonable compensation was to assure \nthat  indigent  criminal  defendants  received  effective  assistance  of  counsel.”    Id.  at  123.  \n“Appointed counsel had a statutory right to reasonable compensation for services provided to \ncriminal indigent defendants long before indigent criminal defendants had a right, statutory or \notherwise, to appointed counsel.”  Id. at 123-124.   \n  In Frederick v Presque Isle Co Circuit Judge, 439 Mich 1, 15; 476 NW2d 142 (1991), \nour Supreme Court stated that all courts are part of Michigan’s one court of justice under Const \n-21- \n\n1963, art 6, § 1; however, “the Legislature retains power over the county and may delegate to the \nlocal governments certain powers,” which it did by enacting a statute that directs certain actions \nof  chief  judges  and  county  treasurers,  MCL  775.16.    Thus,  the  counties  do  not  have  any \nindependent constitutional obligation, apart from the state, to pay for the representation of \nindigent defendants.  Rather, their obligations arise solely out of state statute and, as indicated in \nIn re Recorder’s Court, supra at 123-124, the purpose of the statute was not to secure the \nconstitutional right to counsel.  The counties could be sued for failure to comply with MCL \n775.16; however, that is not the basis or thrust of the instant suit, nor do defendants cite any \njoinder rules or law requiring plaintiffs to include the counties as parties.  Indeed, defendants \nthemselves have not sought to join the counties as parties to the suit under the court rules, MCR \n2.204 to 2.206.  Regardless, we agree with the trial court’s assessment that, even though the \ncounties have been given responsibility for the operation and funding of trial courts through the \nLegislature’s  delegation  powers,  including  payment  of  court-appointed  counsel  for  indigent \ndefendants, it does not relieve defendants of their constitutional duties under Gideon.  Even were \nwe to assume that the counties are necessary parties, it does not form a basis to dismiss the suit \nagainst defendants.   \n  With respect to the judiciary, a circuit court’s chief judge plays the main role in obtaining \nlegal services for indigent defendants as reflected in MCL 775.16.  Additionally, MCR 8.123(B), \nwhich applies to all trial courts,9 provides that the courts “must adopt a local administrative order \nthat describes the court’s procedures for selecting, appointing, and compensating counsel who \nrepresent  indigent  parties  in  that  court.”    An  order  must  be  submitted  to  the  State  Court \nAdministrator  for  review,  and  the  State  Court Administrator  must  approve  the  plan  “if  its \nprovisions will protect the integrity of the judiciary.”  MCR 8.123(C).  Moreover, the judiciary is \nof course a branch of state government.  See Grand Traverse Co v Michigan, 450 Mich 457, 473; \n538 NW2d 1 (1995) (“courts have always been regarded as part of state government” despite \ncounty funding).  Accordingly, the judiciary or the courts in the three counties could have been \nnamed as defendants in this action.  However, again, defendants cite no joinder rules or laws that \nrequired plaintiffs to include the courts in the suit; it was a matter of choice for plaintiffs.  And, \nonce again, defendants are not somehow relieved of their constitutional duties and entitled to \ndismissal even if the courts were or should have been sued.    \n5.  Justiciability and Statement of a Claim for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n  Defendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing and that their claims are not ripe for \nadjudication because the preconviction ineffectiveness claims are too remote, speculative, and \nabstract to warrant the issuance of declaratory and injunctive relief.  Defendants also contend \nthat plaintiffs failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted, considering that they have \nan adequate remedy at law in the form of individual criminal appeals.  Defendants rely chiefly on \nStrickland and its two-part test relative to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.  Defendants \nposit that the need to show injury or harm, relative to justiciability, necessarily equates to \nestablishing deficient performance of counsel and satisfying the prejudice prong of an ineffective \n \n                                                 \n \n9 MCR 8.123(A). \n-22- \n\nassistance  claim  typically  applicable  in  criminal  appeals,  which  prejudice,  and  therefore \njusticiable harm, can only be based on the rendering of an unreliable verdict, compromising the \nright to a fair trial.  Preconviction ineffectiveness, standing alone, is simply insufficient to \nestablish a case.  Stated differently, defendants assert that a Sixth Amendment violation does not \noccur until there is a deficient performance by counsel and prejudice arising out of an unfair \ntrial.  Therefore, in the context of this civil suit claiming a Sixth Amendment infringement, the \ninjury or harm needed to make the case justiciable requires satisfaction of the same two elements \nand that has not been shown.   \n  The trial court found that plaintiffs had standing and that their claims were ripe for \nadjudication, rejecting the argument that convictions or the complete denial of counsel were \nnecessary to litigate the case.  With respect to Strickland, the court indicated that it was unsure \nwhether Strickland had any application to plaintiffs’ pretrial claims of inadequate representation; \nhowever, the court was of the opinion that it would not have to delve into the circumstances of \neach particular criminal case.  Thus, the trial court concluded that plaintiffs had stated a claim  \non which relief could be granted. \na.  Justiciability Generally \n  Both the state and federal constitutions confer only “judicial power” on the courts, US \nConst, art III, § 1, and Const 1963, art 3, § 2, and the United States Constitution expressly \nprovides  that  judicial  power  is  limited  to  cases  and  controversies,  US  Const,  art  III,  §  2.  \nMichigan Chiropractic, supra at 369.  In order to prevent the judiciary from usurping the power \nof coordinate branches of government, our Supreme Court and the federal courts have developed \njusticiability doctrines to ensure that lawsuits filed in the courts are appropriate for judicial \naction, and these “include the doctrines of standing, ripeness, and mootness.”  Id. at 370-371. \nFederal courts have held that standing and mootness are constitutionally derived doctrines and \njurisdictional in nature, given that failure to satisfy the elements of these doctrines implicates the \nconstitutional authority of the courts to only exercise judicial power and to solely adjudicate \nactual  cases  or  controversies.    Id.  at  371.    Michigan  caselaw  has  similarly  viewed  the \njusticiability doctrines as affecting judicial power, “the absence of which renders the judiciary \nconstitutionally powerless to adjudicate [a] claim.”  Id. at 372. \n  In Nat’l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, 471 Mich 608, 614-615; 684 \nNW2d 800 (2004), our Supreme Court explained the concept of “judicial power,” stating: \nThe “judicial power” has traditionally been defined by a combination of \nconsiderations:  the  existence  of  a  real  dispute,  or  case  or  controversy;  the \navoidance of deciding hypothetical questions; the plaintiff who has suffered real \nharm;  the  existence  of  genuinely  adverse  parties;  the  sufficient  ripeness  or \nmaturity of a case; the eschewing of cases that are moot at any stage of their \nlitigation; the ability to issue proper forms of effective relief to a party; the \navoidance  of  political  questions  or  other  non-justiciable  controversies;  the \navoidance  of  unnecessary  constitutional  issues;  and  the  emphasis  upon \nproscriptive as opposed to prescriptive decision making. \n-23- \n\n  With respect to the proper exercise of the “judicial power,” the most critical element is \nthe mandate that there exist a genuine case or controversy between the parties, meaning that the \ndispute between the parties is real, not hypothetical.  Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation v \nNestlé Waters North America Inc, 479 Mich 280, 293; 737 NW2d 447 (2007). \nb.  Standing Principles \n  On the doctrine of standing, the Supreme Court in Michigan Citizens, supra at 294-295, \nquoting Nat’l Wildlife, supra at 628-629, quoting Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm’rs, 464 Mich \n726, 739; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), quoting Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, 504 US 555, 560-561; \n112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 (1992), stated that the following three elements must be proven: \n  First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual \nor imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Second, there must be a causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to \nbe fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result [of] \nthe independent action of some third party not before the court. Third, it must be \nlikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.  [Quotation marks and ellipses omitted.] \nc.  Ripeness Principles \n  With regard to the doctrine of ripeness, it precludes the adjudication of hypothetical or \ncontingent claims before an actual injury has been sustained, and an action is not ripe if it rests \non contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated or may not occur at all.  Michigan \nChiropractic, supra at 371 n 14.  Although standing and ripeness are both justiciability doctrines \nthat assess pending claims to discern whether an actual or imminent injury in fact is present, they \naddress different underlying concerns.  Id. at 378-379.  The standing doctrine “is designed to \ndetermine whether a particular party may properly litigate the asserted claim for relief.”  Id. at \n379.  On the other hand, the ripeness doctrine “does not focus on the suitability of the party; \nrather, ripeness focuses on the timing of the action.”  Id. (emphasis in original). \nd.  Declaratory Relief \n  With  respect  to  declaratory  judgment  actions,  MCR  2.605(A)(1),  (C),  and  (F) \nrespectively provide as follows: \n  In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, a Michigan court of \nrecord may declare the rights and other legal relations of an interested party \nseeking a declaratory judgment, whether or not other relief is or could be sought \nor granted. \n* * * \n  The existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment \nfor declaratory relief in an appropriate case. \n-24- \n\n* * * \n  Further necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory judgment may be \ngranted, after reasonable notice and hearing, against a party whose rights have \nbeen determined by the declaratory judgment. \n  The “actual controversy” requirement found in MCR 2.605(A)(1) has been described as \n“‘a summary of justiciability as the necessary condition for judicial relief.’”  Associated Builders \n& Contractors v Dep’t of Consumer & Industry Services Director, 472 Mich 117, 125; 693 \nNW2d 374 (2005), quoting Allstate Ins Co v Hayes, 442 Mich 56, 66; 499 NW2d 743 (1993).  A \ncourt cannot declare the obligations and rights of parties regarding an issue if the issue is not \njusticiable, meaning that it does not entail a genuine, live controversy between interested persons \nwho  are  asserting  adverse  claims,  which,  if  decided,  can  affect  existing  legal  relations.  \nAssociated Builders, supra at 125, quoting Allstate Ins, supra at 66. \ne.  Injunctive Relief \n  Finally, in regard to injunctive relief, an injunction constitutes an extraordinary remedy \nthat may be issued only when justice requires it, there is an absence of an adequate remedy at \nlaw, and there exists the danger of irreparable injury that is real and imminent.  Pontiac Fire \nFighters Union Local 376 v City of Pontiac, 482 Mich 1, 8; 753 NW2d 595 (2008). \nf.  Justiciability Framework \n  In constructing the broad analytical framework for addressing the justiciability issues in \nconnection with the particular allegations made by plaintiffs, we find guidance in Lewis v Casey, \n518 US 343; 116 S Ct 2174; 135 L Ed 2d 606 (1996).  In Lewis, the respondents were 22 inmates \nimprisoned in various facilities operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADOC), and \nthey  filed  a  class  action  on  behalf  of  all  adult  prisoners  who  were  currently  or  will  be \nincarcerated by the ADOC, alleging deprivations of their fundamental constitutional right of \naccess to the courts.  Id. at 346.  The action was brought in reliance on Bounds v Smith, 430 US \n817, 828; 97 S Ct 1491; 52 L Ed 2d 72 (1977), in which it was held that “the fundamental \nconstitutional right of access to the courts requires prison authorities to assist inmates in the \npreparation and filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners with adequate law \nlibraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law.”  See Lewis, supra at 346.  \nFollowing a three-month bench trial in Lewis, the federal district court ruled in favor of the \nrespondents, concluding that the respondents had a constitutional right of access to the courts \nthat is meaningful, adequate, and effective, and that the ADOC’s system failed to comply with \nthese constitutional standards.  The district court tailored an injunctive remedy that was sweeping \nin scope, ensuring that the ADOC would provide meaningful court access.  The United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, with minor exceptions related to the terms of the \ninjunction.  Id. at 346-348. \n  On certiorari granted, the petitioners argued that, in order to establish a Bounds violation, \nan inmate needed to show that any alleged inadequacy of a prison’s law library facilities or legal \nassistance programs caused an actual injury, or in other words, “‘actual prejudice with respect to \ncontemplated or existing litigation, such as the inability to meet a filing deadline or to present a \n-25- \n\nclaim.’”  Id. at 348.  The petitioners further argued that the district court failed to find sufficient \ninstances of actual injury that would warrant systemwide relief.  Id.  The Supreme Court held: \n  We  agree  that  the  success  of  respondents’  systemic  challenge  was \ndependent on their ability to show widespread actual injury, and that the court’s \nfailure to identify anything more than isolated instances of actual injury renders \nits finding of a systemic Bounds violation invalid.  [Id. at 349.] \n  The United States Supreme Court then proceeded to provide the underlying rationale and \nreasoning for its holding: \nThe requirement that an inmate alleging a violation of Bounds must show \nactual injury derives ultimately from the doctrine of standing, a constitutional \nprinciple  that  prevents  courts  of  law  from  undertaking  tasks  assigned  to  the \npolitical  branches.  It  is  the  role  of  courts  to  provide  relief  to  claimants,  in \nindividual or class actions, who have suffered, or will imminently suffer, actual \nharm; it is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape the \ninstitutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the \nConstitution. In the context of the present case: It is for the courts to remedy past \nor imminent official interference with individual inmates’ presentation of claims \nto the courts; it is for the political branches of the State and Federal Governments \nto manage prisons in such fashion that official interference with the presentation \nof claims will not occur. Of course, the two roles briefly and partially coincide \nwhen a court, in granting relief against actual harm that has been suffered, or that \nwill imminently be suffered, by a particular individual or class of individuals, \norders the alteration of an institutional organization or procedure that causes the \nharm. But the distinction between the two roles would be obliterated if, to invoke \nintervention of the courts, no actual or imminent harm were needed, but merely \nthe status of being subject to a governmental institution that was not organized or \nmanaged  properly.  If—to  take  another  example  from  prison  life—a  healthy \ninmate who had suffered no deprivation of needed medical treatment were able to \nclaim violation of his constitutional right to medical care simply on the ground \nthat  the  prison  medical  facilities  were  inadequate,  the  essential  distinction \nbetween judge and executive would have disappeared: it would have become the \nfunction of the courts to assure adequate medical care in prisons.  [Id. at 349-350 \n(citations omitted).] \n  We derive much from this passage.  It indicates that inmates do not sustain harm, for \npurposes of justiciability analysis and the constitutional right of access to the courts, simply \nbecause of their status as inmates in the prison system and their exposure to the possibility of \nbeing denied meaningful court access because of the institution’s lack of proper management and \norganization.  There needs to be interference with the presentation of a claim to the court, just as \ninmates must first be ill and in need of prison medical treatment before being able to claim \ndeprivation of a constitutional right to medical care.  By analogy, here criminal defendants do \nnot  sustain  harm,  for  purposes  of  justiciability  analysis  and  the  constitutional  right  to  the \neffective assistance of counsel, simply because of their status as indigent defendants with court-\nappointed counsel  subject to prosecutorial proceedings in a system with presumed existing \n-26- \n\ndeficiencies.    There  needs  to  be  an  instance  of  deficient  performance  or  inadequate \nrepresentation, i.e., “representation [falling] below an objective standard of reasonableness.”  \nStrickland, supra at 688; Toma, supra at 302.  Lewis does not indicate that the harm must \ninclude, besides interference with the right of access to the courts, a showing that the inmate \nwould have been successful in court had access been made available.  This proposition is further \nreflected in the Lewis Court’s subsequent observations with respect to actual harm:  \n  Because Bounds did not create an abstract, freestanding right to a law \nlibrary or legal assistance, an inmate cannot establish relevant actual injury simply \nby establishing that his prison’s law library or legal assistance program is subpar \nin some theoretical sense. That would be the precise analog of the healthy inmate \nclaiming  constitutional  violation  because  of  the  inadequacy  of  the  prison \ninfirmary. Insofar as the right vindicated by Bounds is concerned, “meaningful \naccess to the courts is the touchstone,” and the inmate therefore must go one step \nfurther and demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal \nassistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim. He might show, \nfor example, that a complaint he prepared was dismissed for failure to satisfy \nsome technical requirement which, because of deficiencies in the prison’s legal \nassistance facilities, he could not have known. Or that he had suffered arguably \nactionable harm that he wished to bring before the courts, but was so stymied by \ninadequacies of the law library that he was unable even to file a complaint.  \n[Lewis, supra at 351 (citation omitted).]  \n  There is no suggestion in the two examples that the hypothetical inmate had to show that \nthe dismissed or unfiled complaint would likely have resulted in a favorable court outcome \nfollowing litigation; interference, by itself, with a person’s attempt to access the court, if access \nis not sought frivolously, suffices to establish harm.  See id. at 353.10 \n  The Lewis Court went on to find that the district court had identified only two instances \nof actual injury, and the Court then turned to the issue whether those two injuries justified the \nremedy ordered by the district court.  Id. at 357.  The Court noted that the remedy has to be \n“limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.”  Id.  \nThe Court further explained that this principle is just as applicable with respect to class actions.  \nId.  According to Lewis, standing is necessary in class actions and named plaintiffs representing \nthe class must allege and show personal injury.  Id.  The Lewis Court concluded that there was a \nfailure to show that the constitutional violations were systemwide; therefore, granting a remedy \nbeyond what was necessary to provide relief to the two injured inmates was improper.  Id. at 360.  \nNevertheless, the message that flows from Lewis is that in cases where systemwide constitutional \n \n                                                 \n \n10 While we examine Lewis to provide a general framework, we are examining a different \nconstitutional right and one that is expressly provided for in the state and federal constitutions.  \nOur harm analysis later in this opinion is additionally shaped by caselaw directly addressing the \nsame constitutional right at stake here.   \n-27- \n\nviolations  are  proven,  prospective  equitable  relief  to  prevent  further  violations  is  a  proper \nremedy.  \n  The absence of widespread and systemic harm in Lewis was the downfall of the case \npresented  by  the  inmate  respondents.    Here,  if  plaintiffs  are  to  succeed,  they  must  prove \nwidespread and systemic constitutional violations that are actual or imminent, constituting the \nharm necessary to establish justiciability.  In addressing this appeal and the justiciability issues, \nwe find that, on the basis of the posture of the lower court proceedings, our attention needs to be \ndirected solely at the allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint.  In Lewis, supra at 357-358, the \nSupreme Court, quoting Lujan, supra at 561, made the following observations: \nThe general allegations of the complaint in the present case may well have \nsufficed  to  claim  injury  by  named  plaintiffs,  and  hence  standing  to  demand \nremediation, with respect to various alleged inadequacies in the prison system, \nincluding failure to provide adequate legal assistance to non-English-speaking \ninmates and lockdown prisoners. That point is irrelevant now, however, for we \nare beyond the pleading stage. \n“Since  they  are  not  mere  pleading  requirements,  but  rather  an \nindispensable part of the plaintiff’s case, each element [of standing] must be \nsupported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the \nburden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the \nsuccessive  stages  of  the  litigation.  At  the  pleading  stage,  general  factual \nallegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice, for on a \nmotion to dismiss we presume that general allegations embrace those specific \nfacts that are necessary to support the claim. In response to a summary judgment \nmotion, however, the plaintiff can no longer rest on such mere allegations, but \nmust set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts, which for purposes of \nthe summary judgment motion will be taken to be true. And at the final stage, \nthose  facts  (if  controverted)  must  be  supported  adequately  by  the  evidence \nadduced at trial.”  [Alteration in original; citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted.] \n  Here, the justiciability and Strickland issues were raised under both MCR 2.116(C)(4) \n(summary disposition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction) and MCR 2.116(C)(8) (summary \ndisposition for failure to state a claim).  “In reviewing a motion under MCR 2.116(C)(4), it is \nproper to consider the pleadings and any affidavits or other documentary evidence submitted by \nthe parties to determine if there is a genuine issue of material fact.”  Toaz v Dep’t of Treasury, \n280 Mich App 457, 459; 760 NW2d 325 (2008); see also Cork v Applebee’s of Michigan, Inc, \n239 Mich App 311, 315; 608 NW2d 62 (2000) (Under MCR 2.116[C][4], “this Court must \ndetermine whether the pleadings demonstrate that the defendant was entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law, or whether the affidavits and other proofs show that there was no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.”).  MCR 2.116(C)(8) provides for summary disposition where “[t]he opposing \nparty has failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted.”  A motion for summary \ndisposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint.  Beaudrie v \nHenderson, 465 Mich 124, 129; 631 NW2d 308 (2001).  The trial court may only consider the \npleadings in rendering its decision.  Id.  All factual allegations in the pleadings must be accepted \n-28- \n\nas true.  Dolan v Continental Airlines/Continental Express, 454 Mich 373, 380-381; 563 NW2d \n23 (1997). \n  As opposed to the circumstances in Lewis, we are addressing matters of justiciability at a \nvery early stage in the proceedings and not in the context of completed trial proceedings or a \nsummary disposition motion involving the submission of documentary evidence.  The lower \ncourt  record  reveals  that  defendants’  justiciability-related  arguments  were  set  forth  without \nreliance on documentary evidence.  And the argument that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, which only implicated MCR 2.116(C)(8), couched defendants’ \nentire Strickland analysis.  Defendants did not engage in an effort to show an absence of a \ngenuine factual dispute with respect to whether plaintiffs’ claims were justiciable; their argument \nwas purely legal in nature and attacked the alleged inadequacy of the pleadings.   Even though \ndefendants  could  have  taken  a  “documentary  evidence”  approach  for  purposes  of  MCR \n2.116(C)(4), as indicated in Toaz and Cork, they chose not to do so, attempting instead to dispose \nof the case in quick fashion without being buried in the discovery process.  Accordingly, the \nfocus in addressing the justiciability issues under the principles articulated earlier in this opinion \nmust be on the allegations in plaintiffs’ highly detailed complaint.11     \ng.  Defining Justiciable Harm for Purposes of this Suit  \n  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment and prohibitory and mandatory injunctions, which \nremedies are prospective in nature, in an effort to stop alleged ongoing constitutional violations \nand to prevent future violations.  As we view it, plaintiffs would be entitled to declaratory relief, \nin the context of this case and assuming establishment of causation, if they can show widespread \nand systemic instances of actual harm.  The right to any prospective injunctive relief tends to \nconcern the question whether the harm sought to be avoided in the future is imminent, and we \nconclude that harm is imminent if plaintiffs can show widespread and systemic instances of \nactual harm that have occurred in the past under the current indigent defense systems being \nemployed by the counties.  Accordingly, regardless of whether the focus is on declaratory relief \nor on injunctive relief, the proofs will require a showing of widespread and systemic instances of \n \n                                                 \n \n11 In Nat’l Wildlife, supra at 631, our Supreme Court stated: \n[A] plaintiff must include in the pleadings “general factual allegations” \nthat injury will result from the defendant’s conduct. If the defendant brings a \nmotion for summary disposition, the plaintiff must further support the allegations \nof injury with documentation, just as he has to support the other allegations that \nmake up his claim. Finally, when the matter comes to trial, the plaintiff must \nsufficiently support his claim, including allegations of injury, to meet his burden \nof proof. \n  While here there was a motion for summary disposition, it was confined by the parties to \nthe pleadings and the allegations, and it was entertained by the trial court shortly after the filing \nof the complaint.  The case was truly at a pleading-assessment level.   \n-29- \n\nactual harm, thereby making the action justiciable.12  The next step, therefore, is for us to define \n“harm” for purposes of this action. \n  We hold that, in the context of this class action civil suit seeking prospective relief for \nalleged widespread constitutional violations, injury or harm is shown when court-appointed \ncounsel’s  representation  falls  below  an  objective  standard  of  reasonableness  (deficient \nperformance) and results in an unreliable verdict or unfair trial, when a criminal defendant is \nactually or constructively denied the assistance of counsel altogether at a critical stage in the \nproceedings, or when counsel’s performance is deficient under circumstances in which prejudice \nwould be presumed in a typical criminal case.  We further hold that injury or harm is shown \nwhen court-appointed counsel’s performance or representation is deficient relative to a critical \nstage in the proceedings and, absent a showing that it affected the reliability of a verdict, the \ndeficient  performance  results  in  a  detriment  to  a  criminal  defendant  that  is  relevant  and \nmeaningful in some fashion, e.g., unwarranted pretrial detention.  Finally, we hold that, when it \nis shown that court-appointed counsel’s representation falls below an objective standard of \nreasonableness with respect to a critical stage in the proceedings, there has been an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest and harm occurs.  Plaintiffs must additionally show that instances of \ndeficient performance and denial of counsel are widespread and systemic and that they are \ncaused by weaknesses and problems in the court-appointed, indigent defense systems employed \nby  the  three  counties,  which  are  attributable  to  and  ultimately  caused  by  defendants’ \nconstitutional failures.13  If the aggregate of harm reaches such a level as to be pervasive and \npersistent (widespread and systemic), the case is justiciable and declaratory relief is appropriate, \nas  well  as  injunctive  relief  to  preclude  future  harm  and  constitutional  violations  that  can \nreasonably be deemed imminent in light of the existing aggregate of harm.  See Milliken v \nBradley, 433 US 267, 282; 97 S Ct 2749; 53 L Ed 2d 745 (1977) (remedies ordered by court, \nwhile usually not the province of the judiciary, were proper where designed to counter pervasive \nand persistent constitutional violations within the school system).   \n  Plaintiffs will no doubt have a heavy burden to prove and establish their case, but for now \nwe are only concerned with whether plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged supportive facts.  While \n \n                                                 \n \n12 Of course, plaintiffs are not precluded from introducing other evidence that has a tendency to \nshow that future harm is imminent. \n13 In its discussion of class action certification, the dissent states, “Unlike the majority, I am \nunwilling to presume that every alleged deficiency in every indigent criminal defendant’s case is \nthe result of the alleged deficiencies in the county indigent defense systems.”  Post at 34.  We \nagree with the dissent that no presumption should exist, but are at a loss in regard to why the \ndissent concludes that we are making such a presumption.  Throughout this opinion, we indicate \nthat plaintiffs will have to establish a causal connection between the deficient performance and \nthe indigent defense systems being employed.  There will likely be occasions in which counsel \nfor an indigent defendant acted below an objective standard of reasonableness, yet the deficient \nperformance cannot be attributed to problems in an indigent defense system; some attorneys may \nbe lacking in skills, and no amount of money, time, and resources will make a difference.  Again, \nproving their case will be a monumental undertaking for plaintiffs.      \n-30- \n\nwe leave it to the trial court to determine the parameters of what constitutes “widespread,”  \n“systemic,”  or  “pervasive”  constitutional  violations  or  harm,  the  court  must  take  into \nconsideration  the  level  or  degree  of  any  shown  harm,  giving  more  weight  to  instances  of \ndeficient performance that resulted in unreliable verdicts and instances where the right to counsel \nwas denied, with less weight being given where there is mere deficient performance.  We find \nthat the allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint are sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine \ncase or controversy between the parties, reflecting a dispute that is real, not hypothetical. \n  To summarize the approach to be taken on remand, plaintiffs must show the existence of \nwidespread and systemic instances of actual or constructive denial of counsel and instances of \ndeficient  performance  by  counsel,  which  instances  may  have  varied  and  relevant  levels  of \negregiousness, all causally connected to defendants’ conduct.  Furthermore, because the proofs \ncould be so wide ranging, it would reflect poor judgment on our part to set a numerical threshold \nwith  respect  to  the  court’s  determination  of  whether  the  instances  of  harm,  if  shown,  are \nsufficiently “widespread and systemic” so as to justify relief.  The trial court is in a better \nposition to first address this issue, subject of course to appellate review.   \n  We glean from the dissenting opinion that our colleague is of the position that the only \navenue, judiciary-wise, to address problems in the indigent defense systems employed by the \nthree counties is through a standard criminal appeal as reflected in Strickland.  The dissent also \ncontends that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a conviction and deprival of a \nfair trial as reflected in an unreliable verdict, even in this civil class action suit, given the holding \nin Strickland.  Because of the dissent’s position, it is concluding that we are necessarily making a \nfinding of prejudice per se, and thereby a finding of justiciability per se, relative to the claims of \npreconviction ineffectiveness.  Stated differently, the dissent finds that we are assuming that the \nindividual plaintiffs and class members will be convicted, that defendants’ actions caused the \nconvictions, that the courts addressing the criminal cases will not correct any constitutional \ndeficiencies, and that this action will redress their injuries.  We are not making any such \nassumptions, and we respectfully conclude that the dissent simply fails to appreciate the nature \nand character of this civil action brought by a fluid class of plaintiffs that seeks a declaration of \nunconstitutionality  and  prospective,  system-wide  relief  to  prevent  ongoing  and  future \nconstitutional violations. \n  It is our view that Strickland and its many progeny, which demand deficient performance \nby counsel and, generally speaking, prejudice in order to entitle a criminal defendant to relief \nunder the Sixth Amendment, have to be understood and viewed in context.  The fundamental \nflaw in defendants’ and the dissent’s position on the justiciability issues is that the argument is \ngrounded on principles intended to be applied in the context of postconviction criminal appeals \nthat is not workable or appropriate to apply when addressing standing, ripeness, and related \njusticiability  principles  in  this  type  of  civil  rights  lawsuit.    We  cannot  properly  foist  the \nframework of the criminal appellate process upon the justiciability analysis that governs this civil \ncase simply because state and federal constitutional rights related to the right to counsel are \nimplicated.  We reject the argument that the need to show that this case is justiciable necessarily \nand solely equates to showing widespread instances of deficient performance accompanied by \nresulting prejudice in the form of an unreliable verdict that compromises the right to a fair trial.   \n-31- \n\n  It is entirely logical to generally place the decisive emphasis in a court opinion on the \nfairness of a trial and the reliability of a verdict when addressing a criminal appeal alleging \nineffective assistance because the appellant is seeking a remedy that vacates the verdict and \nremands the case for a new trial.  Indeed, it can instantly be gleaned from the opening paragraph \nin Strickland that it has little relevance here: \n  This  case  requires  us  to  consider  the  proper  standards  for  judging  a \ncriminal defendant’s contention that the Constitution requires a conviction or \ndeath  sentence  to  be  set  aside  because  counsel’s  assistance  at  the  trial  or \nsentencing was ineffective.  [Strickland, supra at 671.]    \n  In the case sub judice seeking prospective relief to prevent future harm, we are not \njudging whether a conviction or sentence should be set aside because of the ineffective assistance \nof counsel.  Applying the two-part test from Strickland here as an absolute requirement defies \nlogic,  where  the  allegations  concern  widespread,  systemic  instances  of  constitutionally \ninadequate representation, and where the requested remedy in the form of prospective relief \nseeks to curb and halt continuing acts of deficient performance.  What is essentially harmless-\nerror analysis14 is being confused with justiciability analysis in a case involving an altogether \ndifferent remedy.  The right to counsel must mean more than just the right to an outcome. \n   A simple hypothetical illustrates the inappropriateness of applying, solely, the two-part \nStrickland test and in taking a position that the only avenue of relief is a criminal appeal.  \nImagine  that,  in  100  percent  of  indigent  criminal  cases  being  handled  by  court-appointed \ncounsel, it could be proven that the proceedings were continuously infected with instances of \ndeficient performance by counsel, yet the trial verdicts were all deemed reliable, assuming all \ncases went to trial.  As is often the case, appellate courts affirm guilty verdicts despite inadequate \nrepresentation and deficient performance because there existed strong and untainted evidence of \nguilt.  In our scenario, under defendants’ and the dissent’s reasoning, court intervention in a class \naction suit such as the one filed here would not be permitted on justiciability grounds despite the \nconstitutionally  egregious  circumstances.    This  is  akin  to  taking  a  position  that  indigent \ndefendants who are ostensibly guilty are unworthy or not deserving of counsel who will perform \nat or above an objective standard of reasonableness.  The holding set forth in Gideon becomes \nempty and meaningless under such a rationale.  Widespread and systemic instances of deficient \nperformance caused by a poorly equipped appointed-counsel system will not cease and be cured \nwith a case-by-case examination of individual criminal appeals, given that prejudice is generally \nrequired and often not established.  Even though a criminal appeal may occasionally result in a \nnew trial, it has no bearing on eradication of continuing systemic constitutional deficiencies.  \n \n                                                 \n \n14 Harmless-error analysis mirrors the analysis governing review of the prejudice prong of an \nineffective assistance claim and also implicates a new trial remedy.  See MCL 769.26; People v \nLukity, 460 Mich 484, 495; 596 NW2d 607 (1999). \n-32- \n\nThus, contrary to defendants’ argument and the dissent’s position, there is no adequate legal \nremedy for the harm that plaintiffs are attempting to prevent.15   \n  Contrary to the dissent’s contention, we are not engaging in any findings of prejudice, \nstanding, or justiciability per se.  Rather, we are merely indicating that if it is proven, as alleged, \nthat there have been widespread and systemic instances of deficient performance and denial of \ncounsel, along with proof of the requisite causation, unconstitutionality can be declared and harm \nin ongoing and future criminal prosecutions of indigent defendants can be deemed imminent, \nthereby giving rise to a right to an equitable remedy.  Concluding that an invasion of a legally \nprotected interest is imminent will always carry with it some modicum of speculation; however, \nthere is no caselaw of which we are aware that suggests that a showing of imminent harm is \ninsufficient to permit judicial intervention.  Indeed, the caselaw is to the contrary.  See, e.g., \nMichigan Citizens, supra at 294-295.  The dissent also fails to acknowledge that plaintiffs have \nalleged wrongful convictions.    \n  We additionally find that defendants’ and the dissent’s position ignores the reality that \nharm can take many shapes and forms.  Consistently with the concept of prejudice as employed \nin criminal appeals, we would agree that justiciable injury or harm is certainly indicated by a \nshowing that there existed a reasonable probability that, but for an error by counsel, the result of \na criminal proceeding would have been different.  See Carbin, supra at 599-600.  But injury or \nharm also occurs when there are instances of deficient performance by counsel at critical stages \nin the criminal proceedings that are detrimental to an indigent defendant in some relevant and \nmeaningful fashion, even without neatly wrapping the justiciable harm around a verdict and trial.  \nSuch harm arises, for example, when there is an unnecessarily prolonged pretrial detention, a \nfailure to file a dispositive motion, entry of a factually unwarranted guilty plea, or a legally \nunacceptable pretrial delay.16  And as indicated earlier in this opinion, simply being deprived of \n \n                                                 \n \n15 We are assuming, for purposes of this issue and in contemplation of the elements necessary to \nmerit injunctive relief, that a criminal appeal constitutes a “legal remedy.”  Generally, “[a]ctual \ndamages is a legal, rather than an equitable, remedy[.]”  Anzaldua v Band, 457 Mich 530, 541; \n578 NW2d 306 (1998).  \n16 It is not difficult to conceive of scenarios in which a criminal defendant suffers a detriment or \n“harm” as a result of an attorney’s deficient performance, absent consideration of any trial.  \nEffective assistance of counsel at a preliminary examination potentially can result in a dismissal \nof the prosecutor’s case, as opposed to the case’s being bound over to the circuit court if \ncounsel’s performance was instead deficient.  Effective assistance of counsel at a pretrial hearing \npotentially can result in the exclusion of a confession or an identification, leading to a nolle \nprosequi or dismissal, whereas a deficient performance by counsel, including a failure to even \nfile a motion challenging the confession or identification, could leave the prosecution’s case \nintact and strong.  Effective assistance of counsel in plea negotiations potentially can produce a \nguilty plea on a warranted charge much less serious than the one initially brought by the \nprosecution  that  was  factually  unwarranted,  but  an  ineffective  attorney  in  comparable \ncircumstances might have his or her client plead guilty of the more serious and overcharged \noffense.  Effective assistance of counsel at a bail hearing might result in a defendant’s being able \nto be released on bond before trial, whereas ineffective assistance at the same hearing could \n(continued…) \n-33- \n\nthe constitutional right to effective representation at a critical stage in the proceedings, in and of \nitself, gives rise to harm.   \n  Further, even in criminal appeals there are situations in which the prejudice prong need \nnot be satisfied.  In Strickland, supra at 692, the United States Supreme Court stated that \n“[a]ctual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether is legally presumed to \nresult in prejudice.”  The Court similarly observed in Cronic that constitutional error exists \nwithout a showing of prejudice when counsel is “prevented from assisting the accused during a \ncritical stage of the proceeding.”  Cronic, supra at 659 n 25.  The concept of constructive denial \nof counsel was explored in Cronic, wherein the Court stated that “if counsel entirely fails to \nsubject the prosecution’s case to meaningful adversarial testing, then there has been a denial of \nSixth Amendment rights that makes the adversary process itself presumptively unreliable.”  Id. at \n659.  The Strickland Court made clear that where there is actual or constructive denial of counsel \n“[p]rejudice . . . is so likely that case-by-case inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost.”  \nStrickland, supra at 692.  Strickland also provided “that prejudice is presumed when counsel is \nburdened by an actual conflict of interest.”  Id.  Taking into consideration this precedent for the \npurpose of analyzing justiciability, it is reasonable to conclude that justiciable harm or injury \nexists  when  there  is  an  actual  denial  of  counsel,  there  is  an  overwhelmingly  deficient \nperformance  by  counsel  equating  to  constructive  denial  of  counsel,  or  when  counsel  with \nconflicting interests represents an indigent defendant.  As will be detailed later in this opinion, \nplaintiffs’ complaint contains allegations that fit within the categories of actual and constructive \ndenial of counsel, as well as allegations that encompass other situations in which prejudice is \npresumed.  \n  Our conclusion that the two-part test in Strickland should not control this litigation is \ngenerally consistent with caselaw from other jurisdictions addressing comparable suits.17 \n \n  (…continued) \nleave the defendant sitting in a jail cell pending trial.  An effective attorney may win a dismissal \nof a prosecutor’s case for failure by the state to provide a speedy trial to a defendant, as opposed \nto a situation involving ineffective representation, where the lawyer fails to recognize a speedy \ntrial issue.  These are but a few examples in which the effective assistance of counsel would \neither end the case before trial and conviction or otherwise benefit a defendant in some favorable \nfashion; deficient performance, on the other hand, results in a detriment to the defendant.  Under \na scenario in which an unfiled pretrial motion would have precluded a trial from taking place, a \ncriminal  defendant  still  suffers  some  level  of  harm  or  injury  by  having  his  or  her  life \nunnecessarily put on hold by the trial process even in a situation where the defendant proceeds to \ntrial and is acquitted.  Plaintiffs’ complaint encompasses performance deficiencies during the \npretrial stages mentioned in this footnote.    \n17 In summarizing our position regarding the applicability and relevance of Strickland, we note \nthe  following  points.    We  reject  the  conclusion  that  Strickland  only  allows  for  judicial \nintervention by way of a criminal appeal, and not the type of action pursued here, to address \nissues concerning the right to counsel and the effective assistance of counsel.  We reject the \nconclusion that Strickland requires us to find that justiciability, for purposes of this action, can \nonly  be  established  by  showing  deficient  performances,  coupled  with  convictions  that  are \nunreliable or resulting from unfair trials.  However, with respect to general underlying principles \nespoused in Strickland, and repeated in hundreds if not thousands of cases across the country, \n(continued…) \n-34- \n\n  A case heavily cited on the topic at hand is Luckey v Harris, 860 F2d 1012 (CA 11, \n1988).  Luckey was an action commenced “on behalf of a bilateral class consisting of all indigent \npersons presently charged or who will be charged in the future with criminal offenses in the \ncourts of Georgia and of all attorneys who represent or will represent indigent defendants in the \nGeorgia courts[.]”  Id. at 1013.  The plaintiffs alleged systemic deficiencies with respect to the \nappointment  of  counsel  for  indigent  defendants  that  resulted  in  deprivations  of  various \nconstitutional rights, including the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  The alleged deficiencies \nincluded delays in the appointment of counsel, pressure on attorneys to enter guilty pleas or to \nhurry cases to trial, and inadequate resources.  Relying on Strickland, the federal district court \ndismissed the action for, in part, failure to state a claim.  Id. at 1013, 1016.  The United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, ruling: \n[The  Strickland]  standard  is  inappropriate  for  a  civil  suit  seeking \nprospective relief. The [S]ixth [A]mendment protects rights that do not affect the \noutcome  of  a  trial.  Thus,  deficiencies  that  do  not  meet  the  “ineffectiveness” \nstandard  may  nonetheless  violate  a  defendant’s  rights  under  the  [S]ixth \n[A]mendment. In the post-trial context, such errors may be deemed harmless \nbecause they did not affect the outcome of the trial. Whether an accused has been \nprejudiced by the denial of a right is an issue that relates to relief—whether the \ndefendant is entitled to have his or her conviction overturned—rather than to the \nquestion of whether such a right exists and can be protected prospectively. . . .  \nWhere  a  party  seeks  to  overturn  his  or  her  conviction,  powerful \nconsiderations warrant granting this relief only where that defendant has been \nprejudiced.  The  Strickland  [C]ourt  noted  the  following  factors  in  favor  of \ndeferential scrutiny of a counsel’s performance in the post-trial context: concerns \nfor finality, concern that extensive post-trial burdens would discourage counsel \nfrom  accepting  cases,  and  concern  for  the  independence  of  counsel.  These \nconsiderations do not apply when only prospective relief is sought. \nProspective  relief  is  designed  to  avoid  future  harm.  Therefore,  it  can \nprotect constitutional rights, even if the violation of these rights would not affect \nthe outcome of a trial.  [Id. at 1017 (citations omitted).] \n  We fully agree with the statements and observations made in this passage, and they \nmirror our thoughts voiced earlier in this opinion.  Petitions for rehearing and suggestions of \nrehearing en banc were denied.  Luckey v Harris, 896 F2d 479 (CA 11, 1989), cert den 495 US \n957 (1990).  Eventually, the plaintiffs’ case was dismissed on unrelated abstention grounds.  \nLuckey v Miller, 976 F2d 673 (CA 11, 1992).18  Defendants and the dissent here favor the \n \n  (…continued) \ne.g., deficient performance equates to representation falling below an objective standard of \nreasonableness, we have no qualms.      \n18 The court, citing Younger v Harris, 401 US 37; 91 S Ct 746; 27 L Ed 2d 669 (1971), stated \nthat “abstention from interference in state criminal proceedings served the vital consideration of \ncomity between the state and national governments.”  Luckey, 976 F2d at 676.  “Comity” is \ndefined  as  “[c]ourtesy  among  political  entities  (as  nations,  states,  or  courts  of  different \n(continued…) \n-35- \n\napproach twice rejected in the Luckey cases.  We choose not to give weight to a dissenting \njudge’s analysis that failed to convince a majority of judges on the Eleventh Circuit of its \ncorrectness.    \n  In Platt v State, 664 NE2d 357, 362 (Ind App, 1996), a civil suit was brought seeking \ninjunctive relief premised on the contention “that the system for providing legal counsel for \nindigents in Marion County lacks sufficient funds for pretrial investigation and preparation \nwhich inherently causes ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.”  The plaintiffs alleged that the \npublic defender system violated the fundamental right to effective pretrial assistance of counsel \nunder the Sixth Amendment.  Id.  The appellate court first cited principles from Strickland and \nCronic and then ruled: \nHere, Platt seeks to enjoin the Marion County public defender system \nbecause  it  effectively  denies  indigents  the  effective  assistance  of  counsel. \nHowever, a violation of a Sixth Amendment right will arise only after a defendant \nhas shown he was prejudiced by an unfair trial. This prejudice is essential to a \nviable Sixth Amendment claim and will exhibit itself only upon a showing that \nthe outcome of the proceeding was unreliable. Accordingly, the claims presented \nhere are not reviewable under the Sixth Amendment as we have no proceeding \nand outcome from which to base our analysis.  [Id. at 363 (citation omitted).] \n  This cursory analysis is flawed for all the reasons that we expressed earlier in this \nopinion.  Moreover, the opinion is essentially silent with respect to any particular allegations of \ndeficient performance and harm, and it indicates that the court was not presented with any \ncriminal  proceedings  and  outcomes.    In  the  instant  case,  plaintiffs  allege  wrongful  trial \nconvictions, instances wherein prejudice would be presumed, and situations in which counsel \nwas actually or constructively denied.  We find Platt wholly unpersuasive. \n  There is also the case of Kennedy v Carlson, 544 NW2d 1 (Minn, 1996), in which a chief \npublic defender brought suit.  The Minnesota Supreme Court noted that the public defender \nclaimed  “that  his  clients  have  been  exposed  to  the  possibility  of  substandard  legal \nrepresentation[.]”  Id. at 6 (emphasis added).  The court, without any reference whatsoever to \nStrickland and its two-part test, stated: \nWe  note  that  appellants  cite  a  number  of  decisions  by  other  courts \naddressing the issue of public defense funding. In those cases where courts have \nfound  a  constitutional  violation  due  to  systemic  underfunding,  the  plaintiffs \nshowed substantial evidence of serious problems throughout the indigent defense \n \n  (…continued) \njurisdictions), involving esp. mutual recognition of legislative, executive, and judicial acts.”  \nBlack’s Law Dictionary (7th ed).  The Luckey Court invoked abstention because of concerns \nregarding the possibility that, if relief were granted to the plaintiffs, the federal court would have \nto force the state to promulgate uniform standards related to prosecutions and that the federal \ncourt would have to review and interrupt ongoing state proceedings.  Luckey, 976 F2d at 678-\n679.  Thus, it was the potential of a federal court’s intermeddling in state prosecution practices \nthat served as the basis of the abstention ruling.  Here, abstention issues have no relevance.   \n-36- \n\nsystem. By comparison, Kennedy has shown no evidence that his clients actually \nhave been prejudiced due to ineffective assistance of counsel. To the contrary, the \nevidence establishes that Kennedy’s office is well-respected by trial judges, it is \nwell-funded when compared to other public defender offices, and its attorneys \nhave faced no claims of professional misconduct or malpractice.  [Id. at 6-7.] \n  The Minnesota court then proceeded to cite several cases in which courts from other \njurisdictions have adjudicated matters related to systemic constitutional deficiencies arising out \nof the right to effective counsel.  Id. at 7-8.  The court then ruled: \nThe majority of the cases discussed above cite evidence of substandard \nrepresentation  by  court  appointed  defense  counsel,  generally  supplied  by  a \nparticular defendant, as contributing to the court’s decision to intervene. Kennedy, \nhowever,  has  not  shown  that  his  attorneys  provide  substandard  assistance  of \ncounsel to their clients. . . .  \nIn short, Kennedy’s claims of constitutional violations are too speculative \nand hypothetical to support jurisdiction in this court. The district court did not \nfind that Kennedy’s staff had provided ineffective assistance to any particular \nclient, nor did it find that Kennedy faced professional liability as a result of his \noffice’s  substandard  services.  Nor  do  any  of  Kennedy’s  clients  join  him  in \nattacking the statutory funding scheme at issue here by presenting evidence of \ninadequate assistance in particular cases. In light of Kennedy’s failure to provide \nmore substantial evidence of an “injury in fact” to himself or his clients, we hold \nthat the district court erred in granting Kennedy’s summary judgment motion.  \n[Id. at 8.] \n  Here, we have a class of plaintiffs who have been, are being, or will be subjected to the \ncourt-appointed,  indigent  defense  systems  employed  in  Berrien,  Muskegon,  and  Genesee \ncounties.  Further, we have extensive allegations of substandard representation and ineffective \nassistance of counsel.   Thus, given the distinctions between Kennedy and the instant action, the \nultimate holding in Kennedy is simply inapposite and its underlying discussion tends to support \nour ruling. \n  In New York Co Lawyers’ Ass’n v State, 192 Misc 2d 424, 430-431; 745 NYS2d 376 \n(2002), the New York court rejected a Strickland approach, reasoning: \n  Prejudice, as an aspect of the Strickland test, is examined more generally \nunder  the  State  Constitution  in  the  context  of  whether  defendant  received \nmeaningful representation. (See, People v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022, 646 \nN.E.2d 1102, 1103, 622 N.Y.S.2d 675, 676 (1995) (the test is whether counsel’s \nerrors seriously compromise a defendant’s right to a fair trial). . . .  The purpose is \nto ensure that a defendant has the assistance necessary to justify society’s reliance \non the outcome of the proceedings. Notably, New York is concerned as much \nwith the integrity of the judicial process as with the issue of guilt or innocence, \nand therefore this court finds the more taxing two-prong Strickland standard used \nto  vacate  criminal  convictions  inappropriate  in  a  civil  action  that  seeks \n-37- \n\nprospective relief premised on evidence that the statutory monetary cap provisions \nand compensation rates currently subject children and indigent adults to a severe \nand unacceptable risk of ineffective assistance of counsel. This court further finds \nStrickland’s reliance on post-conviction review provides no guarantee that the \nindigent  will  receive  adequate  assistance  of  counsel  under  the  New  York \nConstitution  in  the  context  of  this  action.  Accordingly,  because  the  right  to \neffective assistance of counsel in New York is much more than just the right to an \noutcome, threatened injury is enough to satisfy the prejudice element and obtain \nprospective injunctive relief to prevent further harm.  (Citation omitted.) \n  In Quitman Co v State, 910 So 2d 1032 (Miss, 2005), the county itself commenced a civil \naction for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that by imposing an obligation on the county \nto  fund  the  representation  of  indigent  defendants,  the  state  of  Mississippi  breached  its \nconstitutional  duties  to  provide  adequate  representation  for  indigent  criminal  defendants. \nConsistent with our opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court stated: \nIn [the first appeal], this Court held that the County would be entitled to \nthe prospective statewide relief it seeks if it established the cost of an effective \nsystem of indigent criminal defense, the county’s inability to fund such a system, \nand the failure of the existing system to provide indigent defendants in Quitman \nCounty with the tools of an adequate defense. The circuit judge ruled that the \nCounty failed to establish these facts . . . . The County asserts that “[t]he evidence \nat trial established each of these elements.”   \nThe  State  correctly  points  out  that  “[c]ommon  sense  suggests  that  if \nQuitman County claims there is widespread and pervasive ineffectiveness, the \nmost probative evidence to support that claim would be testimony about specific \ninstances  when  the  public  defenders’  performance  fell  below  ‘an  objective \nstandard  of  reasonableness’  as  measured  by  the  professional  norms.”  [Citing \nStrickland.] The State also asserts that the circuit judge expected to hear such \ntestimony at trial since the County alleged in its complaint that requiring each \ncounty to pay for its own public defenders did not satisfy the constitutional \nrequirements for effective assistance of counsel. The record reflects that no such \nevidence was presented at trial. . . . . \n  The County did not present any evidence on any one of the central factual \nallegations in its complaint, and the County did not try to show specific examples \nof  when  the  public  defenders’  legal  representation  fell  below  the  objective \nstandard of professional reasonableness.  [Quitman, supra at 1037 (emphasis in \noriginal).] \n  The Mississippi Supreme Court had allowed the case to go forward on the basis of the \nallegations in the complaint, State v Quitman Co, 807 So 2d 401 (Miss, 2001), which is all that \nwe are doing, and our plaintiffs must ultimately prove their case to obtain relief, which the \ncounty in Quitman failed to accomplish. \n-38- \n\n  We finally note Benjamin v Fraser, 264 F3d 175 (CA 2, 2001), which was a suit that \ninvolved the question whether pretrial detainees had demonstrated the existence of current and \nongoing constitutional violations and the need for the continuation of prospective relief with \nrespect to impediments to attorney-client jail visitations.  The United States Court of Appeals for \nthe  Second  Circuit  stated  that  “[i]n  considering  burdens  on  the  Sixth  Amendment  right  to \ncounsel,  we  have  not  previously  required  that  an  incarcerated  plaintiff  demonstrate  ‘actual \ninjury’ in order to have standing.”  Id. at 186.  The court further asserted that “[i]t is not clear to \nus what ‘actual injury’ would even mean as applied to a pretrial detainee’s right to counsel.”  Id.  \nRead in context, the Benjamin court was simply indicating, consistently with our position, that a \nStrickland-like prejudice requirement, arising out of a trial and conviction, is not applicable if the \nright to counsel has been violated.  \n  Having set the analytical framework, including the appropriate standard for justiciable \nharm, we now move on to applying the allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint to the framework.   \nh.  Application of Complaint Allegations to Justiciability Principles \n(i)  Harm and the Named Plaintiffs  \n  Plaintiff Christopher L. Duncan alleges that he pleaded guilty of an overcharged crime \nthat was factually unwarranted because of his attorney’s inadequate representation.  Plaintiff \nBilly Joe Burr, Jr., alleges that he had to endure a delay before an acceptable misdemeanor plea \nwas offered to him, which only occurred after counsel advised him to plead guilty of the charged \nfelony and after Burr demanded that counsel speak further to the prosecutor.  Plaintiff Steven \nConnor alleges that there was a basis to suppress a search without a warrant that was ignored by \ncounsel.    Plaintiff  Antonio  Taylor  alleges  that  there  existed  a  valid  defense  predicated  on \nforensic evidence and witness accounts had counsel bothered conducting an investigation and \ninquiry.  Plaintiff Jose Davila alleges that counsel failed to discuss the charges with Davila, lied \nto the court about it, and failed to challenge a revision of the charges.  Plaintiffs Jennifer \nO’Sullivan, Christopher Manies, and Brian Secrest allege that counsel had effectively gone \nmissing in action, despite the fact that they faced serious charges and that hearings and trials \nwere pending.  A common thread that runs through all the allegations concerning the named \nplaintiffs is the failure of counsel to converse with plaintiffs in a meaningful manner.  The named \nplaintiffs allegedly experienced conduct that included: counsel speaking with plaintiffs, for the \nfirst time, in holding cells for mere minutes before scheduled preliminary examinations while in \nfull  hearing  range  of  other  inmates;  counsel  advising  plaintiffs  to  waive  preliminary \nexaminations without meaningful discussions on case-relevant matters; counsel failing to provide \nplaintiffs with police reports; and counsel generally neglecting throughout the entire course of \ncriminal proceedings to discuss with plaintiffs the accuracy and nature of the charges, the \ncircumstances of the purported crimes, and any potential defenses. They further complain of the \nfollowing: counsel entering into plea negotiations without client input or approval; counsel \nperfunctorily advising plaintiffs to plead guilty as charged absent meaningful investigation and \ninquiry; counsel improperly urging plaintiffs to admit facts when pleas were taken; and, counsel \n-39- \n\nneither preparing for hearings and trials, nor engaging in any communications with plaintiffs \nconcerning  trials.    In  sum,  the  allegations  by  the  named  plaintiffs  include  instances  of \nrepresentation by counsel that fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in regard to \ncritical stages in the criminal proceedings.19 \n(ii)  Harm and Class Members Generally \n  Plaintiffs devote an entire section of the complaint to allegations of harm suffered by  \nclass members.  Plaintiffs allege that class members “are detained unnecessarily or for prolonged \nperiods of time before trial.”  As examples, they refer to contract defenders and counsel for \nindigents who rarely seek bail reductions, despite circumstances calling for reductions, and who \nfail  to  appear  at  court  proceedings,  resulting  in  frequent  postponements  and  rescheduling.  \nPlaintiffs refer to one class member who “was forced to sit in the county jail for months because \nan attorney he never met missed several consecutive court dates, including three scheduled \ncircuit court hearings.”  These allegations include instances of deficient performance, which also \nresulted in the harm of unwarranted, unnecessary, and prolonged delays and detentions.   \n  Plaintiffs next allege that class members are compelled into taking inappropriate pleas, \noften to the highest charged crimes, even “when they have meritorious defenses.”  Plaintiffs \nassert that counsel routinely encourage guilty pleas “without a proper factual basis for guilt” and \nabsent  “even  a  cursory  investigation  into  potentially  meritorious  defenses.”    They  further \ncomplain of counsel pressuring class members to take “open pleas,” which promise no particular \nsentence, and which “often result in punishment that is disproportionate to the facts of the case.” \nPlaintiffs refer to one case in which counsel permitted a client to plead guilty of failure to pay \nrestitution even though he had already paid restitution.  Plaintiffs indicate that class members are \nso fearful that counsel will not adequately prepare for trial that they forgo their right to trial and \nplead  guilty  of  factually  unwarranted  offenses.    These  allegations  regarding  pleas  include \ninstances of deficient performance that inflicted a detriment to indigent defendants. \n  Plaintiffs allege that indigent defendants who insist on going to trial are subjected to \npunitive charges or lengthy pretrial delays.  As an example, plaintiffs refer to an indigent \ndefendant who sat in the Muskegon County jail for 10 months before he finally pleaded guilty of \nvarious charges.  Plaintiffs allege that the indigent defendant’s court-appointed counsel “refused \nto enforce his right to a speedy trial and instead told the client that if he did not plead, the \nprosecutor would drop the charges against him before the speedy trial period ran and re-arraign \n \n                                                 \n \n19 We recognize that much has transpired in the criminal prosecutions related to the named \nplaintiffs since the filing of the instant complaint.  In class actions, while there must be a case or \ncontroversy with respect to a named plaintiff at the time the complaint was filed in a case, the \ncontroversy may continue to exist “between a named defendant and a member of the class \nrepresented by the named plaintiff, even though the claim of the named plaintiff has become \nmoot.”  Sosna v Iowa, 419 US 393, 402; 95 S Ct 553; 42 L Ed 2d 532 (1975).  The overall case, \nhowever, must still present a case or controversy at the time of court review.  Id.  In our \ndiscussion regarding class certification, we return to the issue of mootness and explain why the \ndoctrine compels a conclusion that certification was proper.  \n-40- \n\nhim on the same charges.”  Plaintiffs contend that there had been no evidence connecting the \ndefendant to the crime and that the defendant “had three alibi witnesses who would have testified \nthat  he  was  nowhere  near  the  crime  scene.”    Justiciable  harm  could  be  found  from  these \nallegations. \n  Plaintiffs additionally allege that class members face harsher sentences than warranted by \nthe facts.  They refer to a case in which a criminal defendant received a sentence of 12 to 24 \nmonths’ imprisonment despite the fact that the plea agreement recommended no incarceration.  \nPlaintiffs note that “[w]hen the sentence was imposed, [the defendant’s] attorney said nothing.  \nInstead, it was the prosecutor who reminded the court of its obligation to allow the client to \nwithdraw her plea if the court did not intend to follow the plea agreement.”  Plaintiffs allege that \n“[a]n attorney in Genesee County told a client trying to decide whether to plead guilty to \ntampering with a parking meter that if he were convicted at trial, he would face a sentence of 15 \nyears.  According to Michigan’s sentencing guidelines, however, the sentencing range for the \ncrime with which the client was charged was 0 to 34 months.”  Plaintiffs point to a Berrien \nCounty incident where a defendant was sentenced to 37 days in jail for an offense that had a 30-\nday statutory maximum; counsel said nothing, but the court clerk noticed the error.  Plaintiffs \nalso assert that “[c]ounsel . . . often fail to provide meaningful representation at sentencings,” \nwith “[s]ome attorneys offer[ing] information during sentencing proceedings that is detrimental \nto their clients’ cases.”  Other attorneys, according to plaintiffs, “often fail to catch sentencing \nerrors and do not read the pre-sentencing reports prior to the sentencing hearings.”  Plaintiffs \nfurther allege that inadequate representation results in indigent defendants’ being improperly \nassessed fees, which they have no ability to pay, and they assert that failures by counsel to \nexplore  otherwise  available  alternatives  to  incarceration  result  in  access  being  denied  to \nalternatives such as drug treatment programs.  These allegations include instances of deficient \nperformance detrimental to indigent defendants. \n  Plaintiffs next maintain that “[c]ounsel are unable to file necessary motions for pre-trial \nsuppression, discovery, [and] speedy trial, motions to quash circuit court bind-over, or motions \nin limine[, and] [t]hey often fail to challenge illegal identifications, illegal searches and seizures, \nor illegally obtained confessions.”  Plaintiffs complain that “some attorneys refuse to provide \ntheir clients with copies of court files and police records.”  These allegations include instances of \ndeficient performance detrimental to indigent defendants. \n  With respect to trials, plaintiffs allege: \n  Counsel cannot prepare adequately for court hearings and trial.  Many do \nnot  call  witnesses  to  testify  on  their  clients’  behalf,  do  not  call  experts  to \nchallenge the prosecution, and do not perform meaningful cross-examinations.  \nOthers do not make opening or closing statements at trial.  In fact, many do not \nput on any meaningful defense case at all. \nPlaintiffs do allege that wrongful convictions have occurred, which suggests satisfaction of the \nStrickland prejudice requirement typically applicable in criminal appeals. \n \n-41- \n\n(iii)  Presumed Prejudice and Harm \n  Plaintiffs  allege  that  the  three  challenged  court-appointed,  indigent  defense  systems \n“fail[] to provide counsel to all eligible indigent defendants.” Plaintiffs claim that “[s]ome \nmembers . . . must represent themselves because they are wrongfully denied defender services.” \nIn that same vein, plaintiffs allege that “indigent defendants who are constitutionally eligible for \nstate-appointed counsel are denied counsel.”  As an example, plaintiffs contend that “[o]ne \nBerrien County judge . . . routinely refuses to appoint counsel to defendants who have made \nbail[.]”  On this same topic, plaintiffs maintain that “[t]he Muskegon law firm holding the \nindigent defense contract advises its lawyers to move to be discharged from representing clients \nwho have full-time jobs, regardless of how little those jobs pay.”  And “[o]ne attorney in \nGenesee County refuses to represent indigent defendants assigned to him if he considers them to \nbe financially ineligible.  Instead, he offers to represent them as a private attorney, at a discount \nfrom his normal rate.”  Plaintiffs further contend that, as a result of a failure to abide by national \nperformance  standards,  class  members  are  “constructively  denied,  or  threatened  with  the \nconstructive denial of counsel.” These allegations concern the actual or constructive denial of \ncounsel, which would ordinarily give rise to a presumption of prejudice in a criminal appeal, and \nwhich would constitute justiciable harm.   Strickland, supra at 692; Cronic, supra at 659.   \n  Plaintiffs also allege that “attorneys routinely represent clients in situations in which \nconflicts of interest exist.”  According to plaintiffs, “[m]any indigent defense counsel also serve \nas prosecutors, often in the same courtrooms before the same judges.  Some are assigned to \ndefend individuals they previously prosecuted.”  As an example, plaintiffs allege that “a Berrien \nCounty attorney does both felony defense work and abuse and neglect work.  He has no system \nfor screening conflicts despite the possibility of defending a parent under the felony contract who \nis also the subject of an abuse and neglect proceeding under the other contract.”  Prejudice is \npresumed when an attorney is burdened by an actual conflict of interest.  Strickland, supra at \n692.    \n(iv)  Widespread Harm, Causation, and Redress of Injury \n  We first find that the allegations discussed in the preceding sections reflect widespread \nand systemic instances of violations of the constitutional right to counsel and the effective \nassistance of counsel.   \n  Plaintiffs  allege  that  an  absence  of  standards,  training,20  programs,  supervision, \nmonitoring,  guidelines,  and  independence  from  the  judicial  and  prosecutorial  functions  has \nresulted in indigent counsel having too many cases,21 insufficient support staff, insufficient or no \n \n                                                 \n \n20 According to plaintiffs, “many indigent defense counsel are unable adequately to advise their \nclients because they are unaware of key aspects of criminal law and procedure, such as the notice \nrequirement for the use of an alibi defense or appropriate objections.” \n21 Plaintiffs claim: \n(continued…) \n-42- \n\nresources to hire experts and investigators,22 and a lack of skills and experience to properly \nhandle  assigned  cases.    Plaintiffs  further  maintain  that  these  problems  have  created  severe \nobstacles in putting cases presented by the prosecution to the crucible of meaningful adversarial \ntesting.  They additionally contend: \n  As a result of the[] systemic deficiencies, indigent defense counsel do not \nmeet  with  clients  prior  to  critical  stages  in  their  criminal  proceedings;[23] \ninvestigate adequately the charges against their clients or hire investigators who \ncan  assist  with  case  preparation  and  testify  at  trial;  file  necessary  pre-trial \nmotions;  prepare  properly  for  court  appearances;  provide  meaningful \nrepresentation at sentencings; or employ and consult with experts when necessary.  \nIn  addition,  the  systemic  deficiencies  provide  no  method  for  ensuring  that \nattorneys are representing clients free from conflicts of interest.    \n  We  have  recited  above  the  numerous  harms  claimed  by  plaintiffs  and,  ultimately, \nplaintiffs allege a nexus or causal connection between the widespread and systemic deficiencies \nand defendants, asserting: \n  As a direct result of Defendants’ failure to ensure that indigent defense \nproviders have the tools necessary to provide constitutionally adequate indigent \ndefense in the three Counties, indigent defense services in the Counties, and \nelsewhere in the State, are operated at the lowest cost possible and without regard \nto the constitutional adequacy of the services provided.  The result is that the \nindigent defense provided in each of the three Counties does not meet - and does \nnot  attempt  to  meet  -  the  [American  Bar  Association’s]  Ten  Principles, \n \n  (…continued) \n  [I]n Berrien County, 6 of the 12 contract holders in 2004 received a \ncollective total of 4,479 felony and misdemeanor cases, for an average of over \n746  cases  per  attorney.    One  attorney  doing  contract  work  regularly  had  a \ncaseload of 1,000 cases a year (700 misdemeanors and 300 felonies) in addition to \n200 private cases.  One attorney in Muskegon County handled 700 felony cases \nper year; another routinely handled 15 felonies per week. \n22 Plaintiffs allege that “[i]ndigent defense counsel are unable adequately to investigate the \ncharges against their clients or to hire investigators who can assist with case preparation and \ntestify at trial.”  They note that “[i]n 2004, the trial court administrator in Berrien County did not \nreceive a single request for an expert or an investigator.”  (Emphasis added.) \n23 Plaintiffs allege: \n  Most indigent defense counsel do not speak with their clients before they \narrive at the courthouse for the probable cause hearing.  Attorneys in the Counties \nroutinely enter into plea negotiations without clients’ permission and before initial \nclient interviews.  One Genesee County attorney has stated that he only meets \nwith incarcerated clients prior to a preliminary examination if they are charged \nwith felonies punishable by more than five to ten years of imprisonment. \n-43- \n\nMichigan’s Eleven Principles, or commensurate safeguards; and does not meet or \neven attempt to meet the constitutional minimums required by the United States \nand Michigan Constitutions.[24] \n \n                                                 \n \n24 We note that the complaint contains numerous additional paragraphs alleging the necessary \ncausal connection.  The dissent, citing Ashcroft v Iqbal, __ US __; 129 S Ct 1937; 173 L Ed 2d \n868  (2009),  argues  that  the  causation  allegations  in  plaintiffs’  complaint  fail  because  they \nconstitute mere legal conclusions and because the allegations implausibly assert causation and \nare incapable of being proven or disproven.  The dissent contends that it is impossible for \nplaintiffs  to  prove  that  the  alleged  inaction and  failures  by  defendants  caused  the  asserted \nconstitutional violations.  To the extent that Ashcroft, a case interpreting the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure and cases construing those rules, even has application to the case at bar, which is \ncontrolled by the Michigan Court Rules, it does not support summary dismissal of plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint.  With respect to the argument that the allegations of causation are legal conclusions, \nwe first note that any allegation of causation, whatever the context, carries with it some tinge of a \nlegal conclusion.  Additionally, the extensive complaint sets forth numerous factual allegations \nthat bear on the issue of causation, including those cited by us in this opinion. We initially \nreiterate the principle so long ago announced in Gideon that it is the state that ultimately has the \naffirmative constitutional obligation to implement a system that safeguards the right to counsel \nfor indigent defendants, which right, under Strickland and Cronic, includes the right to the \neffective assistance of counsel.  If a county system is constitutionally inadequate under the \nstandards we have set today, i.e., a finding of widespread and systemic instances of deprivation \nof  counsel  and  deficient  performance  resulting  from  a  flawed  county  system  of  providing \nindigent  representation,  but  the  county  is  in  full  compliance  with  existing  state  law  and \nmandates, the cause of the constitutional deficiencies will necessarily flow from failures by the \nstate.    The  complaint  alleges  that  the  state  has  provided  little  or  no  funding,  or  fiscal  or \nadministrative oversight, opting to continue a centuries-old practice of delegating to the counties \nthe responsibility for funding and administering indigent defense services.  It is alleged that \ndefendants have done nothing to ensure that the counties have in place the necessary funding, \npolicies, standards, qualifications, programs, training, guidelines, and other resources that would \nenable attorneys to provide constitutionally adequate representation.  The complaint goes into \nparticularized factual detail on each of these matters, e.g., “Neither the Berrien nor Muskegon \nCounty programs have written job descriptions or qualifications.”  It is further alleged that the \nlack  of  fiscal  oversight,  administrative  oversight,  funding,  policies,  standards,  programs, \nqualifications, training, guidelines, and other resources results in defense providers who have too \nmany cases, lack sufficient support staff, are unable to obtain investigators and experts, lack the \ntools necessary to do their jobs, are wanting in skills and experience to handle assigned cases, \nand who essentially cannot put a prosecutor’s case to the crucible of meaningful adversarial \ntesting.  As an example, plaintiffs allege that, as a result of inadequate training, “many indigent \ndefense counsel are unable adequately to advise their clients because they are unaware of key \naspects of criminal law and procedure, such as the notice requirement for the use of an alibi \ndefense or appropriate objections.”  Plaintiffs then allege that these systemic problems result in \nthe wrongful denial of counsel, deficient performance, wrongful convictions, unnecessary or \nprolonged pretrial detentions, inappropriate guilty pleas, and unwarranted harsh sentences.  In \nother words, defendants have violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  Well-pleaded factual \nallegations relative to causation have been presented and not solely mere legal conclusions.  The \nparagraphs in the complaint that are conclusory form the framework of the complaint and are \n(continued…) \n-44- \n\n  This case involves indigent criminal defendants who were, are, and will be subjected to \nthe court-appointed, indigent defense systems employed by the relevant counties.  And there are \nextensive allegations concerning detrimental and harmful effects on these criminal defendants, as \nthey pass through the systems, caused by ineffective attorneys, which, in turn, is allegedly the \nresult of the state’s and the Governor’s failure to protect the constitutional rights of indigent \ndefendants.  Accordingly, there are sufficient allegations of a causal connection between the \ninjuries and the complained-of conduct, and plaintiffs have also indicated that the injuries would \nbe redressed by a favorable court decision granting the prayed-for equitable relief.  See Michigan \nCitizens, supra at 294-295.  We hold that, on the basis of the pleadings and at this juncture in the \nlawsuit, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts that, if true, establish standing, establish that the \ncase is ripe for adjudication, and state claims upon which declaratory and injunctive relief can be \nawarded.  Stated differently, the case is presently justiciable, because a case or controversy \nexists.  Whether plaintiffs can ultimately prove their allegations and establish their case is a \nmatter for another day. \n6.  Class Certification \n  Defendants maintain that the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs’ motion to certify the \nclass.  Defendants contend that plaintiffs failed to show that a class action is the superior way to \nlitigate the claims.  In support of the superiority argument, defendants assert that a “class action \nserves no useful purpose because the requested relief may be obtained from an individual action \nand would automatically accrue to the benefit of others similarly situated.”  As part of the \nsuperiority argument, defendants also argue that a class action suit is inconvenient, impractical, \nand unmanageable under the applicable  Strickland standard, which requires examination of \nindividual proofs.   In further support of the superiority argument, defendants argue that the class \nis unmanageable because the three counties are too factually disparate, that the class creates \npractical  problems  in  litigating  the  claims,  that  indigent  criminal  defendants  will  suffer  no \nadverse effect if this Court decertifies the class, and that plaintiffs have adequate remedies at \nlaw.  Finally, defendants maintain that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate commonality, where the \nalleged systemic violations will require individualized proof and the relief would not be the same \nfor all class members.  The trial court, on the basis of the pleadings, ruled contrary to each one of \ndefendants’  arguments,  finding  that  plaintiffs  established  commonality,  superiority,  and \ntypicality. \n  In Neal v James, 252 Mich App 12, 15-16; 651 NW2d 181 (2002), this Court articulated \nsome general principles applicable in determining whether a class should be certified: \n \n  (…continued) \nmore than sufficiently supported by factual allegations.  See Ashcroft, ___ US at ___; 129 S Ct at \n1950; 173 L Ed 2d at 884 (“While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, \nthey must be supported by factual allegations.  When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a \ncourt  should  assume  their  veracity[.]”).    Further,  the  allegations  plausibly  suggest \nunconstitutional conduct and practices by defendants and entitlement to relief, and while the \ncausation allegations may be difficult to prove and establish, we cannot conclude that it is \nimpossible to prove causation.  We, as an appellate court, should not engage in trying the case, \nnor deny plaintiffs the opportunity to present their proofs.             \n-45- \n\n  Because  there  is  limited  case  law  in  Michigan  addressing  class \ncertifications, this Court may refer to federal cases construing the federal rules on \nclass certification. When evaluating a motion for class certification, the trial court \nis  required  to  accept  the  allegations  made  in  support  of  the  request  for \ncertification as true. The merits of the case are not examined.  The burden is on \nthe plaintiff to show that the requirements for class certification exist.  [Citations \nomitted.]   \n  “The five factors a court must consider when deciding whether to certify a class are \nfound in MCR 3.501(A)(1), and a plaintiff seeking to certify a class must show that all five \nenumerated requirements are satisfied.”  Hill, supra at 310, citing A&M Supply Co v Microsoft \nCorp, 252 Mich App 580, 597-598; 654 NW2d 572 (2002) (emphasis in original).   MCR \n3.501(A)(1) provides: \nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative \nparties on behalf of all members in a class action only if: \n(a) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(b) there are questions of law or fact common to the members of the class \nthat predominate over questions affecting only individual members; \n(c) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; \n(d) the representative parties will fairly and adequately assert and protect \nthe interests of the class; and \n(e) the maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other \navailable methods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration of \njustice. \na.  Number of Class Members and Practicality of Joinder \n  The first requirement for class certification is that the class must be “so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable[.]”  MCR 3.501(A)(1)(a).  In the complaint, plaintiffs \nindicate: \n  The Class is defined as all indigent adult persons who have been charged \nwith or will be charged with felonies in the District and Circuit Courts of Berrien, \nGenesee, and Muskegon Counties and who rely or will rely on the Counties to \nprovide them with defense services.  The Class includes all indigent adults against \nwhom  felony  criminal  charges  will  be  brought  in  Berrien,  Genesee,  and \nMuskegon Counties during the pendency of this action. \n  We  agree  with  plaintiffs  that  the  class,  as  defined  in  the  complaint,  is  sufficiently \nnumerous so as to make joinder of each class member impractical.  We also reject the dissent’s \nargument challenging this ruling under Zine, supra.  In Zine, this Court was concerned with \n-46- \n\nlemon-law booklets issued by Chrysler that were distributed to purchasers of new vehicles and \nthat were allegedly misleading.  We find Zine distinguishable because it did not entail the type of \nprospective, system-wide relief sought here, it did not involve a fluid class of plaintiffs such as \nexists in the case at bar, and because it did not present allegations of widespread and systemic \ninstances of harm, as we have defined the term “harm” in this opinion.     \nb.  Commonality of Legal and Factual Questions \n  The second requirement for class certification is that there must be “questions of law or \nfact  common  to  the  members  of  the  class  that  predominate  over  questions  affecting  only \nindividual members[.]”  MCR 3.501(A)(1)(b).  While this action will require contemplation of \nspecific instances of deficient performance and instances of the actual or constructive denial of \ncounsel, the ultimate broad factual questions common to all members in the class, given the type \nof relief sought, is whether there have been widespread and systemic constitutional violations, \nwhether the violations were and are being caused by deficiencies in the county indigent defense \nsystems, and whether the system deficiencies were and are attributable to or resulted from the \naction or inaction of defendants.  Any evidence concerning individual prosecutions has no \nbearing on those particular criminal cases and the available appellate remedies, except to the \nextent of any effect on a pending case caused by a system-wide remedy resulting from an order \nor judgment rendered in this action.  The evidence pertaining to individual prosecutions merely \nconstitutes a piece in the larger puzzle relative to establishing a basis for prospective, system-\nwide relief.  In the context of this type of civil rights action, unlike the situation in Zine, the \nfactual  question  that  will  be  of  any  relevance  to  all  class  members  revolves  around  the \nestablishment of widespread and systemic instances of deficient performance and denial of \ncounsel; the case’s viability with regard to all members depends on an aggregation of harm that \nis pervasive and persistent. \n  The dissent’s reliance on Neal is equally misplaced.  The case involved claims of racial \ndiscrimination brought by a class of African-Americans who held or had sought employment \nwith the city of Detroit’s law department.  The trial court certified the class, and this Court \nreversed for failure to satisfy the commonality requirement.  The Neal panel reached its holding \nbecause “individual factual circumstances pertinent to each plaintiff will need to be reviewed, \nand individual, fact-specific inquiries will need to be made in evaluating why certain individuals \nwere not hired or promoted, or why other individuals were discharged or not retained.”  Neal, \nsupra at 20.  Importantly, the Court thereafter stated that the plaintiffs had “simply not shown \nthat  there  was  any  specific  policy  or  practice  followed  by  defendants  to  satisfy  the \n‘commonality’  requirement[.]”    Id.    Here,  plaintiffs’  case  is  built  on  defendants’  and  the \ncounties’ policies and practices, it requires proof of widespread and systemic constitutional \nviolations before any relief is available, and it focuses on system-wide, prospective relief.  Neal \nis simply inapposite.   \n  Next, there is also commonality with respect to the legal questions, which all concern \nstate and federal constitutional rights to due process and to counsel.  We conclude that the \nallegations in the complaint satisfy the commonality requirement in regard to both the factual \nand legal questions presented.  \n \n-47- \n\nc.  Typicality of Claims \n  The third requirement for class certification is that there must be “claims . . . of the \nrepresentative parties [that] are typical of the claims . . . of the class[.]”  MCR 3.501(A)(1)(c).  \nAs reflected in our earlier review of the allegations in the complaint, the claims of the named \nplaintiffs, which pertained mostly to deficient performance of counsel at critical pretrial stages of \nthe criminal proceedings, are typical of the allegations of the class members.  We conclude that \nthe allegations in the complaint satisfy the typicality requirement.     \nd.  Protection of Interests by Representative Parties \n  The fourth requirement for class certification is that “the representative parties [must] \nfairly and adequately assert and protect the interests of the class[.]”  MCR 3.501(A)(1)(d).  \nPlaintiffs allege: \n  [The] Class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs’ counsel know of no conflicts of interest between the \nclass representatives and absent class members with respect to the matters at issue \nin this litigation; the class representatives will vigorously prosecute the suit on \nbehalf of the Class; and the class representatives are represented by experienced \ncounsel.  \n  Given that “the trial court is required to accept the allegations made in support of the \nrequest for certification as true” when evaluating a class certification motion, Neal, supra at 15, \nand considering the quoted allegations, we conclude that MCR 3.501(A)(1)(d) has been satisfied.   \ne.  Superiority \n  With respect to the fifth factor, whether “the maintenance of the action as a class action \nwill  be  superior  to  other  available  methods  of  adjudication  in  promoting  the  convenient \nadministration of justice,” MCR 3.501(A)(1)(e), MCR 3.501(A)(2) provides: \nIn determining whether the maintenance of the action as a class action will \nbe  superior  to  other  available  methods  of  adjudication  in  promoting  the \nconvenient administration of justice, the court shall consider among other matters \nthe following factors: \n(a) whether the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual \nmembers of the class would create a risk of \n(i)  inconsistent  or  varying  adjudications  with  respect  to  individual \nmembers  of  the  class  that  would  confront  the  party  opposing  the  class  with \nincompatible standards of conduct; or \n(ii) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class that \nwould as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of other members not \nparties  to  the  adjudications  or  substantially  impair  or  impede  their  ability  to \nprotect their interests; \n-48- \n\n(b) whether final equitable or declaratory relief might be appropriate with \nrespect to the class; \n(c) whether the action will be manageable as a class action; \n(d) whether in view of the complexity of the issues or the expense of \nlitigation  the  separate  claims  of  individual  class  members  are  insufficient  in \namount to support separate actions; \n(e) whether it is probable that the amount which may be recovered by \nindividual class members will be large enough in relation to the expense and \neffort of administering the action to justify a class action; and \n(f) whether members of the class have a significant interest in controlling \nthe prosecution or defense of separate actions. \n  In Edgcumbe v Cessna Aircraft Co, 171 Mich App 573, 575; 430 NW2d 788 (1988), this \nCourt explained that “[t]he requirement of MCR 3.501(A)(1)(e), that the class action be superior \nto other methods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration of justice, is an \noutgrowth of the equitable heritage of class actions and a recognition of the practical limitations \non the judiciary’s capability to resolve disputes.”  The relevant concern in determining the \nconvenient administration of justice is whether the issues are so disparate as to make a class \naction suit unmanageable.  Dix v American Bankers Life Assurance Co of Florida, 429 Mich \n410, 419; 415 NW2d 206 (1987).  “Matters such as diversity of defenses, counterclaims, et \ncetera  may  bear  upon  the  determination  of  whether  a  class  action  suit  will  promote  the \nconvenient administration of justice.”  Lee v Grand Rapids Bd of Ed, 184 Mich App 502, 505; \n459 NW2d 1 (1989). \n  On examination and consideration of the enumerated factors relative to superiority, MCR \n3.501(A)(2), we conclude that they weigh in favor of certification of the class.  It is vital to keep \nin mind the nature of plaintiffs’ complaint in analyzing the class certification issue.  Plaintiffs \nwill need to establish widespread instances of ineffective assistance of counsel and denial of \ncounsel.  Because criminal prosecutions in the three counties are not being stayed during the \npendency of this litigation, class members constitute a fluid class and the attendant criminal \nproceedings will continually be in flux.  Indeed, the prosecutions of the named plaintiffs, to our \nknowledge, have been mostly resolved.  Promoting the convenient administration of justice \nnecessarily demands that this case proceed as a class action.  In Reynolds v Giuliani, 118 F Supp \n2d 352, 391-392 (SD NY, 2000), the federal district court commented: \n  [C]lass certification is not a mere formality because it will insure against \nthe danger of this action becoming moot. This case involves a fluid class where \nthe claims of the named plaintiffs may become moot prior to completion of this \nlitigation. The danger of mootness is magnified by the fact that defendants have \nthe ability to moot the claims of the named plaintiffs, thereby evading judicial \nreview  of  their  conduct.  Thus,  this  Court,  like  other  courts  under  these \ncircumstances, believes that class certification is necessary. See Greklek v. Toia, \n565 F.2d 1259, 1261 (2d Cir. 1977) (affirming district court’s grant of class \n-49- \n\ncertification in action requesting declaratory and injunctive relief “since only class \ncertification could avert the substantial possibility of the litigation becoming moot \nprior to the decision”); Alston v. Coughlin, 109 F.R.D. 609, 612 (S.D. N.Y. 1986) \n(“[t]he plaintiff’s interest in averting the possibility of the action becoming moot, \nwith the concomitant interest in judicial economy, makes class certification in this \ncase more than an empty formality”); Jane B. [v New York City Dep’t of Social \nServices] 117 F.R.D. [64, 72 (SO NY, 1987)] (“[a]n additional reason for granting \nthe motion for certification lies in avoiding problems of mootness”); Ashe [v Bd of \nElections] 124 F.R.D. [45, 51 (ED NY, 1989)] (“[a] further ground for finding \nclass certification to be more than a ‘formality’ here is to avoid the danger of the \nindividual plaintiffs’ claims becoming moot before a final adjudication”); Koster \nv. Perales, 108 F.R.D. 46, 54 (E.D. N.Y. 1985) (class certification is necessary \nwhen  “absent  certification,  there  is  a  substantial  danger  of  mootness”). \nAccordingly, plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is granted. \n  We have the same mootness dangers if this case is not pursued through the vehicle of a \nclass action lawsuit.  This fact alone defeats most of defendants’ arguments on the issue of class \ncertification,  e.g.,  the  argument  that  a  class  action  serves  no  useful  purpose.  Absent  class \ncertification, and even assuming that no mootness issue exists, the prosecution of separate \nactions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications.  MCR 3.501(A)(2)(a).  \nFurthermore, equitable and declaratory relief would not only be appropriate for the class on \nestablishing its case, it is the only relief being sought.  MCR 3.501(A)(2)(b).  Additionally, we \nfind that the action would be manageable as a class action, that any claims by individual class \nmembers would be insufficient to support separate actions in view of the complexity of the \nissues or the expense in litigation, that recoverable dollar amounts are not at issue, and that \nindividual class members do not have a significant interest in controlling separate actions.  MCR \n3.501(A)(2)(c) through (f).  Defendants’ arguments to the contrary, including those hinging on \nthe now rejected two-part Strickland test, are unavailing. \nIV.  Summary \n  We respectfully disagree with our dissenting colleague’s criticisms of this opinion and, to \nthe extent not already addressed above, feel compelled to respond.  This case certainly presents \ndifficult issues, requiring us, in part, to tread in unchartered legal waters.  There are, however, \nsome fundamental principles at play here. \n  It is well-accepted that part of the judiciary’s role and function in our tripartite system of \ngovernment is to interpret constitutional provisions, apply constitutional requirements to the facts \nat  hand,  and  safeguard  and  protect  constitutional  rights,  all  through  entry  of  orders  and \njudgments as guided by stare decisis.  That the judiciary can declare executive and legislative \nconduct unconstitutional, can prohibit continuing unconstitutional conduct by the two other \nbranches of government, and can demand constitutional compliance, hardly seem to be foreign \nprinciples in the jurisprudence of this state and the country.  For support, we need not look any \nfurther than the historic landmark case of Marbury, supra at 177-180, in which Chief Justice \nJohn Marshall so eloquently stated: \n-50- \n\nThe  constitution  is  either  a  superior  paramount  law,  unchangeable  by \nordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other \nacts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.  If the former part of \nthe alternative be true, then a legislative act, contrary to the constitution, is not \nlaw: if the latter part be true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts, on the \npart of the people, to limit a power, in its own nature illimitable.  Certainly all \nthose who have framed written constitutions contemplate them as forming the \nfundamental and paramount law of the nation, and consequently the theory of \nevery such government must be, that an act of the legislature, repugnant to the \nconstitution, is void.  This theory is essentially attached to a written constitution, \nand is, consequently, to be considered, by this court, as one of the fundamental \nprinciples of our society. It is not, therefore, to be lost sight of, in the further \nconsideration of this subject. \nIf an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, \nnotwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and oblige them to give it effect? \nOr, in other words, though it be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as if \nit was a law? This would be to overthrow, in fact, what was established in theory; \nand would seem, at first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, \nhowever, receive a more attentive consideration.  It is, emphatically, the province \nand duty of the judicial department, to say what the law is. Those who apply the \nrule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two \nlaws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. \nSo, if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the \nconstitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that \ncase, conformable to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformable to the \nconstitution,  disregarding  the  law;  the  court  must  determine  which  of  these \nconflicting rules governs the case: this is of the very essence of judicial duty.  If \nthen, the courts are to regard the constitution, and the constitution is superior to \nany ordinary act of the legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, \nmust govern the case to which they both apply.  Those, then, who controvert the \nprinciple, that the constitution is to be considered, in court, as a paramount law, \nare reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the \nconstitution,  and  see  only  the  law.    This  doctrine  would  subvert  the  very \nfoundation  of  all  written  constitutions.  It  would  declare  that  an  act  which, \naccording to the principles and theory of our government, is entirely void, is yet, \nin practice, completely obligatory. It would declare, that if the legislature shall do \nwhat is expressly forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express prohibition, is \nin reality effectual. It would be giving to the legislature a practical and real \nomnipotence, with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within \nnarrow limits. It is prescribing limits, and declaring that those limits may be \npassed as pleasure. \nThat  it  thus  reduces  to  nothing,  what  we  have  deemed  the  greatest \nimprovement on political institutions, a written constitution, would, of itself, be \nsufficient, in America, where written constitutions have been viewed with so \n-51- \n\nmuch reverence, for rejecting the construction. But the peculiar expressions of the \nconstitution of the United States furnish additional arguments in favour of its \nrejection.  The judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising \nunder the constitution.  Could it be the intention of those who gave this power, to \nsay, that in using it, the constitution should not be looked into? That a case arising \nunder the constitution should be decided, without examining the instrument under \nwhich it arises?  This is too extravagant to be maintained.  In some cases, then, \nthe constitution must be looked into by the judges. And if they can open it at all, \nwhat part of it are they forbidden to read, or to obey?  There are many other parts \nof the constitution which serve to illustrate this subject. \n* * * \n[I]t is apparent, that the framers of the constitution contemplated that \ninstrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature.  \nWhy otherwise does it direct the judges to take an oath to support it?  This oath \ncertainly applies in an especial manner, to their conduct in their official character.  \nHow immoral to impose it on them, if they were to be used as the instruments, \nand the knowing instruments, for violating what they swear to support!  The oath \nof office, too, imposed by the legislature, is completely demonstrative of the \nlegislative opinion on this subject.  It is in these words: “I do solemnly swear, that \nI will administer justice, without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor \nand to the rich; and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge all the duties \nincumbent  on  me  as  __________,  according  to  the  best  of  my  abilities  and \nunderstanding, agreeably to the constitution, and laws of the United States.”  Why \ndoes a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the constitution of the \nUnited States, if that constitution forms no rule for his government?  [I]f it is \nclosed upon him, and cannot be inspected by him?  If such be the real state of \nthings, this is worse than solemn mockery.  To prescribe, or to take this oath, \nbecomes equally a crime.  [Paragraphs reconfigured; emphasis added.] \n  Moving forward more than 200 years, the United States Supreme Court in Boumediene, \nsupra, reiterated the principles from Marbury.  The Court stated that abstaining from questions \nrequiring political judgments reflects recognition that such matters are best left to the political \nbranches and not the judiciary.  Boumediene, supra, 553 US at ___; 128 S Ct at 2259; 171 L Ed \n2d  at  77.    However,  “[t]o  hold  [that]  the  political  branches  have  the  power  to  switch  the \nConstitution on or off at will is quite another [matter].”  Id.  This would unacceptably “permit a \nstriking anomaly in our tripartite system of government, leading to a regime in which Congress \nand the President, not this Court, say ‘what the law is.’”  Id., quoting Marbury, supra at 177. \n  Political judgments are involved in determining the manner and method by which a state \nproceeds in providing representation for indigent criminal defendants, including, as in Michigan, \ndelegation of representation matters to local counties and chief judges.  But if the state has \nallegedly failed to satisfy its constitutional obligations with its chosen approach, i.e., switching \noff state and federal constitutions, it is up to the judiciary to judge whether the state has indeed \nacted consistent with constitutional requirements.  From Marbury to Boumediene, this field has \nbeen  defined  as  including  the  interpretation  of  constitutional  language,  the  application  of \n-52- \n\nconstitutional  principles,  the  judging  of  constitutional  compliance,  and  the  safeguarding  of \nconstitutional rights.  This is all that is occurring in this case.  Without allowing for court \nexamination and possible intervention, the Governor and the Legislature effectively determine \n“what the law is” with respect to the right to counsel and the right to the effective assistance of \ncounsel.   \n  We are not setting public policy.  Rather, we are simply indicating that the judiciary can \nevaluate the constitutional compliance of policies implemented by the two political branches of \ngovernment.  We are not suggesting that the judiciary can dictate to the other branches of \ngovernment the type of system to employ in providing representation for indigent defendants.  \nThe judiciary, however, can and must have a say with respect to whether a chosen system is \nconstitutionally sound.  The judiciary clearly cannot require the political branches to use a \n“better”  system  than  a  system  currently  in  place,  where  the  existing  system  sufficiently \nsafeguards constitutional rights.  See Grand Traverse Co, supra at 472 (it is for the Legislature to \ndecide whether to implement a more desirable system).   \n  Concerns have been expressed with expenses that may be incurred by state taxpayers and \nthe state to operate an indigent defense system.  Assuming this were to occur, we first note that \nthe taxpayers of this state are already bearing the burden of paying for the representation of \nindigent  defendants;  it  is  just  being  accomplished  through  different  taxing  authorities.  \nImportantly, economic concerns did not dissuade the Supreme Court in Gideon from construing \nthe United States Constitution in a manner that mandates effective assistance of counsel for \nindigent defendants.  Further, during these economically challenging times, the judiciary, in \naddressing constitutional issues, must be reminded of the words of Chief Justice Warren Berger \nin Bowsher v Synar, 478 US 714, 736; 106 S Ct 3181; 92 L Ed 2d 583 (1986): \n  No one can doubt that Congress and the President are confronted with \nfiscal and economic problems of unprecedented magnitude, but “the fact that a \ngiven law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions \nof government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.  \nConvenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives—or the hallmarks—of \ndemocratic government . . . .”  [Citation omitted.] \n  With respect to the expressed concerns about the possible prospect that the state will have \nto operate an indigent defense system at the trial level, we care not whether it is the state, \nadministrative  agencies,  counties,  municipalities,  courts,  or  any  other  bodies,  alone  or  in \ncombination, that operate a system providing representation for indigent criminal defendants.  \nOur only concern is that whatever system is adopted, regardless of what entity operates the \nsystem, it must safeguard the constitutional rights to counsel and the effective assistance of \ncounsel.    Plaintiffs  have  filed  a  complaint  containing  sufficient  allegations  that  those \nconstitutional rights are not currently being protected in the three counties at issue under the \nsystems  employed  by  those  counties,  which  can  ultimately  be  blamed  on  defendants’ \nconstitutional failures.  Plaintiffs are thus entitled to have their day in court.   \n \n \n-53- \n\nV.  Conclusion \n  We hold that defendants are not shielded by governmental immunity, that defendants are \nproper parties, that the trial court, not the Court of Claims, has jurisdiction, and that the trial \ncourt has jurisdiction and authority to order declaratory relief, prohibitory injunctive relief, and \nsome level of mandatory injunctive relief, the full extent of which we need not presently define.  \nWe further hold that, on the basis of the pleadings and at this juncture in the lawsuit, plaintiffs \nhave sufficiently alleged facts that, if true, establish standing, establish that the case is ripe for \nadjudication, and state claims upon which declaratory and injunctive relief can be awarded.  \nFinally, we hold that the trial court properly granted the motion for class certification. \n  Affirmed. \n  Sawyer, J., concurred. \n/s/ William B.

We VACATE our order dated July 16, 2010, \nand we REINSTATE our order in this case dated April 30, 2010, because reconsideration \nthereof was improperly granted.   \n \n  We do not retain jurisdiction. \n \n  Dissenting statement of CORRIGAN, J., to follow. \n \n  DAVIS, J. (concurring).   \n \n  I agree with Chief Jus tice KELLY’s dissent from the July  16, 2010, order, stating \nthat  the prior motion  for  reconsideration should have   been de nied  because it adde d \nnothing new.  To the extent the unanim ous April 30, 2010, order was reconsidered \nbecause of concerns that it could not be  complied with, I have  reviewed the record \nthoroughly and I do not a gree with those concerns.  Furthermore, if those concerns \neventually prove warranted, the trial court should, and is in the best position to, make that \nevaluation.  The trial court has not yet had th e opportunity to do so.  As the April 30, \n2010, order stated, this case is at its earliest stages and a decision on its substantive merits \nis premature, but class certification s hould be reconsidered in light of Henry v Dow \nChemical Co, 484 Mich 483 (2009).  The  original, unanimous order of this Court w as \ncorrect, and no sufficient basis was presented for this Court to have reconsidered it. \n \n  HATHAWAY, J., joins the statement of DAVIS, J. \n \n  CORRIGAN, J., states as follows: \n \n  I object to the release of  the Court’s order without my dissenting statement and I \nreserve the right to file one as soon as I  can.  The majority has decided to grant the \nmotion  for  reconsideration,  and to revers e  our pre vious  order,  without affording \ndisagreeing Justices sufficient time to adequately respond to  this decision.  Instead, the \nmajority has now decided to expedite the release of its order regardless of the fact that I \nhave worked in a timely fa shion to prepare a dissenting  statement, but have not yet \ncompleted such a statement.   This is contrary to our practice during t he 11 years I have \nserved on this Court.  The Court’s decision to suddenly expedite this case seems designed \nto  prevent  the new   Court  after  January  1, 2011 from   considering  a m otion  for \nreconsideration.   \n \n  MARKMAN, J. (dissenting).  \n \n \n\n \n3\n \n  I dissent from the order granting plainti ffs’ motion for reconsideration, vacating \nthis Court’s July 16, 2010 order, and reinstating this Court’s April 30, 2010 order.  The \nJuly 16 order vacated  the April 30 order and held that  “[t]he defendants are entitled to \nsummary disposition because, as the Court of Appeals dissenting opinion recognized, the \nplaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable.”  In  a concurring statement, I explained that our \nApril 30 order was erroneous for two reasons: \n \n  First, as defendants observe, this order vacated the Court of Appeals \nopinion without articulating any governing standards.  Second, it is not \npremature to decide this case because the precise issue presented is whether \nplaintiffs have stated a claim  on which relief can be granted, a nd this, as \nwell as the threshold justiciability issu es, can be determined on the face of \nthe  complaint.  [ Duncan  v Stat e  of Michigan,  486  Mich 1071 (2010)  \n(MARKMAN, J., concurring).] \nIn  addition, I concluded that defendants  are  entitled to summary disposition for the \nfollowing reasons set forth in the Court of Appeals’ dissent: \n \n  (1) The U.S. Supreme Court in  Gideon v Wainwright, 372 US 335 \n(1963), and Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668 (1984), “was concerned \nwith results, not process.  It did not presume to tell the states how to assure \nthat indigent criminal defendants receive effective assistance of counsel.”   \n284 Mich App 246, 357 (2009).  \n  (2)  Plaintiffs’ claims would ha ve  “the judiciary override t he \nMichigan system of local control and funding of legal services for indigent \ncriminal  defendants,”  despite the  absence  here of any cons titutional \nviolation.  Id. at 358. \n  (3) Plaintiffs’ claims are not suff icient to create a presumption of \neither prejudice, or prejudice per se, th at would warrant either declaratory \nor injunctive relief.  Id. at 361. \n  (4)  Plaintiffs  lack standi ng,  and,  therefore, their claims are not \njusticiable.  Id. at 371. \n  (5) Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe  for adjudication, and, therefor e, \ntheir claims are not justiciable.  Id. at 371, 376. \n  (6) Plaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable and, therefore, the relief they \nseek should not be granted.  Id. at 385. \n  (7) In finding a justiciable controversy, the Court of Appeals erred in \nadopting a number of a ssumptions that are conjectural and hypothetical,  \nincluding assumptions that plaintiffs and the class they purport to represent \n \n \n\n \n4\nwill be convicted of the crimes with  which they are charged, that such \nconvictions will result from prejudice stemming from ineffective assistance \nof  counsel, that such ineffective a ssistance  will be attr ibutable  to the \ninaction of defendants, and that trial  and appellate judges will be unable or  \nunwilling to afford relief for such violations of the Sixth Amendment.  Id. \nat 368-370. \n  (8) There is no constitutional precedent that “guarantees an indigent \ndefendant a particular attorney” or an  “attorney of a particular level of \nskill” [as long as the attorney is not  “so deficient as to cause prejudice”]; \nthat requires a “predetermined amount of outside resources be available to \nan attorney”; or that requires that th ere be a “meaningful relationship with \ncounsel.”  Id. at 370[, 384]. \n  (9)  The Court of Appeals asser tions  that affordi ng  plaintiffs \ninjunctive  relief “could potentially   entail a cessation of criminal \nprosecutions against indigent defendants,” id. at 273, and “that not hing in \nthis opinion should be r ead as foreclosing entry  of an order gra nting the \ntype  of re lief  so vi gorously  challenged  by defendants,”  id.  at 281, \naccurately  describe the potential c onsequences  of its opinion, which \nconsequences would constitute an altogether unwarranted, improper, and \nexcessive response to plaintiffs’ claims.  Id. at 380-385. \n  (10) The Court of Appeals has “issued an open invitation to the trial \ncourt to assume ongoing operational control over the systems for providing \ndefense counsel to i ndigent criminal defendants in Berrien, G enesee and \nMuskegon counties.”  And  with that invitation comes a “blank check” on \nthe  part of the judiciary to “for ce  sufficient state level legislative \nappropriations  and  executive  branch  acquiescence”  in assuming similar \ncontrol over the systems in every count y in this state, while “nullifying the \nprovisions” of the cri minal defense act and “superseding the authority of \nthe Supreme Court and t he State Court Administrator.”  Id. at 383-384.  \n[Duncan, 486 Mich at 1072 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).] \nBecause plaintiffs have not presented anything in the present motion for reconsideration \nthat causes me to believe that the above reasons do not continue to justify our decision to \nreverse the Court of Appeals, I would deny plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration. \n \n  CORRIGAN and YOUNG, JJ., join the statement of MARKMAN, J. \n \n   \n \n   \n \nI, Corbin R. Davis, Clerk of the Michigan Supreme Court, certify that the \nforegoing is a true and complete copy of the order entered at the direction of the Court. \n \nNovember 30, 2010 \n                                                                                        _________________________________________ \n1124     Clerk \n ",

      "text": " \n \nMSC Order: Duncan v. State of Michigan  \n19. July 2010 By Matthew Nelson  \nIn an extraordinary development, the Michigan Supreme Court dismissed the putative class action brought by \nindigent criminal defendants against the State’s public defender system.  In May, the Court issued a unanimous \norder holding that a decision on the defendants’ motion for summary disposition was premature.  On defendants’ \nmotion for reconsideration, the Court adopted the dissent from the Court of Appeals and concluded that the \nplaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable.   Chief Justice Kelly and Justices Cavanagh and Hathaway dissented. \nAs has been well-publicized, the ACLU initiated a putative class action against the State for failing to adequately \nfund the public defense of indigent criminal defendants.  The Ingham County Circuit Court granted class \ncertification and denied defendants’ motion for summary disposition.  \nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals majority affirmed the trial court’s decision.  Our earlier post summarizing the \nCourt of Appeals’ decision is here.  In dissent, Judge Whitbeck concluded that the relevant Supreme Court \nprecident required a showing that defense counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair \ntrial.  He argued that there is no Sixth Amendment violation when the trial was fair, that is, when the defendant \nwas not prejudiced.  Because prejudice (and actual or constructive denial of counsel) can only be shown based on \nthe circumstances of an actual trial, the defendants lack standing because they could not allege prejudice before \nactually being convicted.  In his view, the majority’s reasoning rested on a number of speculative assumptions, \nincluding that the defendants would be convicted at trial and that the inaction of the State and the Governor \nwould be the cause of any ineffective assistance received by the indigent defendants. \nThe Michigan Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and held oral argument.  On May 1, 2010, the Court \nremanded the issue of class certification to the trial court for reconsideration in light of Henry v. Dow Chemical \nCompany, but affirmed the denial of summary judgment.  \nThe defendants moved for reconsideration arguing that the remand order did not give the lower court any \nguidance for resolving the issue of justiciability.  Justice Weaver joined Justices Corrigan, Markman, and Young in \nreversing their earlier decision.  Justice Markman wrote a concurring opinion joined by Justices Corrigan and \nYoung.  The concurring justices explained that the threshold issue of justiciability could be determined from the \nface of the complaint, and then summarized the reasons for granting summary disposition as identified in Judge \nWhitbeck’s dissent: \n   \n \n \nWarner Norcross & Judd \nwww.wnj.com \n \n\n \n \n  In Gideon v. Wainwright and Strickland v. Washington, the Supreme Court was concerned with results–\neffective assistance of counsel–and not process–how states provide indigent criminal defendants with \neffective assistance of counsel. \n  The Plaintiffs’ claims would have the judiciary override the Michigan system of local control and funding \nof legal services for indigent criminal defendants in the absence of any constitutional violation. \n  Plaintiffs lack standing and their claims are not ripe.  Thus, their claims are not justiciable. \nChief Justice Kelly dissented, noting that nothing had changed since the Court’s May 1, 2010 order, and \nconsequently there could be no palpable error justifying reconsideration. \n \n \n \nWarner Norcross & Judd \nwww.wnj.com \n ",

Indeed, it is the fundamental \nprofessional duty of all attorneys to ensure that the right to counsel is fully protected: \nA lawyer is ... an officer of 'he legal system and a public \ncifizen having special responsibility for the quality ojjllslice . . .. \nAs a public citizen. a lawyer should seek improvement of the law. \nthe administration of justice and the quality of service rendered by \nthe  legal  profession.  .  .  .  A  lawyer  should  be  mindful  of \ndeficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the \npoor,  and  sometimes  persons  who  are  not  poor,  cannol  afford \nadequate legal assistance, and should therefore devote professional \ntime and civic innuence in their behalf.  A lawyer should aid the \nlegal profession  in  pursuing these objectives and should help  the \nbar regulate  itself in  the  public  interest.  [MRPC  Preamble:  A \nLawyer's Responsibilities (emphasis added).I] \nAmici provide further information about each of their organizations' missions below. \nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawvers \nThe National Association of Criminal  Defense  Lawyers  (NACDL)  is a  not-for-profit \nprofessional organization that represents the nation's criminal defense attorneys.  NACDL is the \nSee also ABA Criminal Justice Section Standards: Defense Section. Standard 4-1-2(d) (\"Defense counsel should \nI \nseek  [Q  reform  and  improve  the  administration  of criminal justice.  When  inadequacies  or  injustices  in the \nsubstantive or procedural law come to defense counsel's attentiOll,\"fie or she should stimulate efforts for remedial \naction.\"). \n\n•  • \npreeminent organization advancing the institutional mission of the nation's criminal defense bar \nto ensure the proper and fair administration of justice, and justice and due process for all persons \naccused of crime.  Founded in  1958, NACDL has a membership of more than  11,000 direct \nmembers and an additional 35,000 affiliate members in all 50 states and 30 nations.  Its members \ninclude  private  criminal  defense  lawyers.  public  defenders,  military  defense  counsel,  law \nprofessors, and judges committed to preserving fairness and promoting a rational and humane \ncriminal  justice  system.  The  American  Bar  Association  recognizes  NACDL  as  an affiliate \norganization and accords it representation in the House of Delegates. \nIn  furtherance  of  its  mission  to  safeguard  the  rights  of the  accused  and  champion \nfundamental constitutional rights, NACDL frequently appears as amicus curiae before the United \nStates Supreme Court, the federal courts of appeal and the highest courts of numerous states.  In \nrecent years, NACDL's briefs have been cited on numerous occasions by the Supreme Court in \nsome of the most important criminal  law decisions.  See, e.g, Kennedy v Louisiana,  US  ; \n- -\n128 S Ct 2641, 2663; 171  L Ed 2d 525 (2008); ROlhge!y v Gillespie COl/illy,  US  ; 128 S Ct \n- -\n2578, 2587; 171  L Ed 2d 366; Blakely v WashinglOn, 542 US 296, 312; 124 S Ct 2531; 159 L Ed \n2d 403 (2004), \nNACDL has a specific and demonstrated interest in ensuring that accused persons have \naccess to qualified counsel at  every stage of a criminal  proceeding.  NACDL most recently \nsupported this principle in RothgelY  v Gille!>pie County, where NACDL successfully urged the \nSupreme Court to find that the right to counsel unequivocally attaches at arraignment, the first \nformal proceeding at which an individual is accused.  Access to counsel at that point is critical-\noften the determinative factor between freedom and confinement.  Indeed, the allegations in this \ncase, if true, will  establish that this fundamental  right is systematically violated  in  Michigan. \n2 \n\n•  • \nNACDL, informed by the experience of its membership, is uniquely well  positioned to inform \nthis Court of the consequences that are visited upon criminal defendants when they are subjected \nto  representation  by  overburdened  and  under-resourced  counsel,  and  why  post-conviction \nremedies are inadequate to redress this deficiency. \nFinally,  NACDL commits significant  institutional resources  to  ensurmg that  indigent \naccused persons have access to meaningful and effective representation.  NACDL maintains a \nfull-time  Indigent  Defense  Counsel  whose  sole  responsibility is  to  support  indigent  defense \nreform efforts throughout the cowltry.  The Association is currently pursuing initiatives in  at \nleast half a dozen states.  Further, NACDL devotes considerable resources to providing back-up \nsupport to both public defenders and private counsel who handle assigned cases, and funds a full \ntime Resource Counsel to perform that function.  The Association recognizes that a system of \ncriminal justice that provides inferior justice to those whose poverty prevents them from  hiring \nprivate counsel is inconsistent with fundamental American values, including, most significantly, \nthe constitutional right to counsel. \nAccordingly, NACDL brings a perspective that can inform the Court's consideration of \nthe issues in this case, and has a direct interest in seeing that the indigent accused have a vehicle \nto redress systemically deficient representation. \nBrennan Center for Justice \nThe  Brennan  Center  for  Justice  at  New  York  University  School  of Law  (\"Brennan \nCenter\") is a non-partisan public policy and law institute that focuses on fundamental issues of \ndemocracy and justice.  An important part of the Brennan Center's work is its effort to close the \n3 \n\n•  • \n\"justice gap\"  by strengthening public defender services and working to secure the promise of \nGideon v Wainwright, 372 US 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963). \nThe Brennan Center's Access to Justice Project is dedicated to ensuring that low-income \nindividuals,  families,  and  communities  in  this  country  are  able  to  obtain  effective  legal \nrepresentation.  The Brennan Center has filed a number of amicus briefs in support of the rights \nof the indigent accused, including briefs before the United States Supreme Court, federal courts \nof appeal, and state high courts.  See, e.g., Rothgery v Gillespie County (amicus brief filed on \nbehalf of the Brennan Center, NLADA, and the NAACP Legal  Defense &  Educational  Fund); \nHurrell-Harring  v Slate oj New  York,  No.  8866-07 (pending before  the New York  Court of \nAppeals) (amicus brief filed on behalf of former prosecutors). \nThrough its work to close the \"justice gap,\" the Brennan Center has gained an in-depth \nunderstanding of the burdens that inadequate defense services for  the poor  place on the least \nadvantaged,  on  the  prosecution, on  the  courts,  and  on  Ollr  society.  The  Brennan  Center's \nexperiences provide it with a unique perspective on the issues raised in this lawsuit, and a fiml \nbelief that this case should be permilted to proceed. \nNAACP Legal Defense &  Educational Fund \nThe NAACP Legal Defense and  Educational  Fund, Inc.  (\"LDF\") is the nation's oldest \ncivil  rights law firm. Founded as an arm of the NAACP in 1939 by Charles Hamilton Houston \nand Thurgood Marshall to redress injustice caused by racial discrimination and to assist African \nAmericans in securing their constitutional and statutory rights, LDF has operated independently \nsince  1957. Through litigation, advocacy, public education, and outreach, LDF works to secure \n4 \n\n•  • \nequal justice under law for all  Americans, and to break down the barriers that prevent minority \ngroups from realizing their basic civil and human rights. \nLDF has a  longstanding commitment  to  ensuring adequate representation to  the poor. \nThe issue of adequate indigent defense, and  specifically the Court's approach to the right  to \ncounsel,  has  a  particularly  significant  impact  upon  the  African  Americans  who  are \ndisproportionately represented at every stage of the criminal justice system. For over six decades, \nLDF attorneys  have represented parties and  participated  as amicus curiae  in  litigation before \nfederal  and state courts asserting the right to counsel  in  criminal proceedings, including most \nrecently in  ROlhgery 11  Gil/e~pie COUnly,  and  in  state court in  Richmond v  Distriel  Court of \nMary/and, _  A2d _; 20 I 0 WL 744210 (Md 20 10). \nThe Constitution Project \nThe Constitution Project (\"The Project\") is an independent think tank that promotes and \ndefends constitutional safeguards.  The Project seeks to achieve this goal through constructive \ndialogue across  ideological and  partisan  lines, and  through scholarship, activism, and  public \neducation efforts.  The  Project  has earned  wide~ranging respect  for  its  expertise  and  reports, \nincluding practical  material  designed to  make constitutional  issues a part of ordinary political \ndebate.  The  Project  frequently  appears as  amiclls  curiae  before  the  United States Supreme \nCourt, the  federal courts of appeal,  and  highest state courts,  in  support  of the  protection of \nconstitutional rights. \nThe  Project's  National  Right  to  Counsel  Committee  is  a  bipartisan  committee  of \nindependent experts representing all segments of America's justice system.  Established in 2004, \nthe Committee spent several years examining  the ability of state courts to  provide adequate \ncounsel, as required  by the United  States Constitution, to  individuals charged in  criminal and \n5 \n\n•  • \njuvenile delinquency cases who are unable to afford lawyers.  In 2009, the Committee issued its \nseminal report, Jus/ice  Denied:  America's  Continuing Negieci of  Our Consl ilutional RighI 10 \nCounsel, which included the Comminee's findings on the right to counsel nationwide, and based \non  those  findings,  made  22  substantive  recommendations  for  reform.  The  Committee's \nrecommendations  urged  states  to  provide  sufficient  funding  and  oversight  to  comply  with \nconstitutional requirements and endorsed litigation seeking prospective relief on behalf of a class \nof in dig en I defendants when states fail to comply with those requirements. \n6 \n\n•  • \nINTRODUCTION \nThe  systemic  deficiencies  in  Michigan's  indigent  defense  system  violate  criminal \ndeFendants' right to counsel under both the United States and Michigan constitutions and creale \nan imminent and irreparable risk that the indigent accused will be denied their right to effective \nrepresentation.  These constitutional harms. borne disproportionately by communities of COIOf. \ncannot be remedied after-the-fact by post-conviction proceedings.  For these reasons, Plaintiffs \nhave established a cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief. \nAccording to the Complaint, because of systemic defects. including inadequate funding, \nsupervision,  and  guidelines  for  the  assignment  of attorneys,  criminal  defendants  in  three \nMichigan counties routinely lack representation that meets even tbe basic standards of the legal \nprofession.  This  lack  of meaningful  representation causes  Plaintiffs to  be  routinely  harmed \nthroughout  the  course  of their  criminal  proceedings  - resulting  in  excessive  bailor  the \nunnecessary denial of bail, overcharging, wrongful convictions. guilty pleas that are not knowing \nand voluntary, and excessive sentences.  Because the United States and Michigan constitutions \nensure the right to counsel at all critical stages of a criminal proceeding, these harms, including \nharms arising  from pre-trial representation such as  the  unnecessary denial  of bail. violate the \nPlaintiffs' constitutional rights. \nMoreover. the prospective relief sought in the Complaint is the only way to address such \nconstitutional injuries.  First, post-conviction review can do nothing to redress the many harms \ncaused by the absence of counselor ineffective assistance of counsel during pre-trial and pre \nconvictions proceedings, such as the wrongful denial of bailor unnecessary incarceration due to \nanorney delay.  Post-conviction review pursuant to Strickland v Washington, 466 US 668; 104 S \nCt 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984), focuses on whether attorney error led to a wrongful conviction \n7 \n\n•  • \nand, thus.  it  cannot redress  deprivations of liberty  or other harms resulting from  ineffective \nrepresentation in pre-trial proceedings.  Second, post-conviction review cannot identify all of the \ncases in  which a conviction was in  fact  caused by  ineffective  representation.  In some cases, \nerrors by trial counsel may make it  impossible to establish that effective representation would \nhave altered  the outcome of the  proceeding, as  required  under Strickland.  For example, an \nattorney's  failure  to  promptly  and  comprehensively  confer  with  a  client  may  result  in  the \npermanent loss of witnesses and evidence that cannot later be recreated to demonstrate prejudice \nunder Strickland.  Third, even when a defendant is successful in overturning a conviction due to \nineffective assistance of counsel. this post·conviction relief cannot fully remedy the harm to the \nindividual  from  a  wrongful  conviction - particularly  if that  conviction  led  to  incarceration. \nFinally, any post-conviction relief awarded under Strickland would generally apply only to an \nindividual case or defendant, while the underlying systemic deficiencies remain intact. \nSuch  limitations  on  the  effectiveness  of post-conviction  remedies  are  exactly  why \nMichigan law grants the judicial branch equitable power to issue prospective relief in response to \nimminent and irreparable constitutional injuries caused by systemic deficiencies.  Declaratory \nand injunctive relief is both necessary and appropriate in light of the nature of the harms alleged \nin  the  Complaint.  For all  of these  reasons,  this  Court  should  find  that  the  Plaintiffs  have \nadequately alleged a claim for relief and allow this case to go forward. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The systemic deficiencies in indigent defense services described in the Complaint \ncreate an imminent risk that the Plaintiffs' right to counsel will be violated in \nways that cannot be cured by post-conviction review, making this suit both \nnecessary and appropriate. \n8 \n\n•  • \nThe deficiencies in indigent defense representation described in the Complaint constitute \nviolations of the Plaintiffs' right to counsel under the United States and Michigan constitutions, \nand  the  resulting  injuries  cannot  be  fully  remedied  by  post·conviction  review  pursuant  to \nSIrickland  Because  Plaintiffs allege  that  they  face  imminent and  irreparable constitutional \ninjury, they have stated a claim for reliefand this case should be permitted to go forward. \nA.  The Complaint describes systemic violations of the Plaintiffs' right to counsel \nunder the United States and Michigan constitutions. \nThe  systemic  deficiencies  described  in  the  Complaint,  which  produce  inadequate \nrepresentation of the indigent, violate the right to counsel under both the Sixth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution and Article I, § 20 of the Michigan Constitution.  While the State tries \nto dismiss the Plaintiffs' claims as mere \"public policy concerns,\" see Defendants\" Brief 19, the \nComplaint  details  concrete  constitutional  injuries  to  criminal  defendants  in  three  Michigan \ncounties which result from Michigan's failure to provide an effective system of defense services. \nAs described  in the  Complaint,  there  are  serious, systemic  defects  in  how  Michigan \nprovides defense services to the poor that lead to  the regular denial  of the Plaintiffs'  right to \neffective counsel.  Three Michigan counties fail  to provide even basic resources and safeguards \nto  provide  criminal defendants  with  competent  representation  - for  example, attorneys  lack \nsupervision and training, there are no performance or eligibility standards to monitor their work, \nand there are no standards for attorney workload to ensure that attorneys have adequate time and \nresources to properly represent their clients.  Complaint 'i~ 6, 7. \nThe  result  is  systemic deficiencies  in  the  provision of defense  services for  the poor. \nThus, eligible defendants are regularly denied counsel altogether.  Complaint ~ 109.  Moreover, \neven when defendants are granted representation, defense counsel regularly do not meet the basic \n9 \n\n•  • \nstandards of the  profession, failing,  among other things, to  meet with clients prior to  critical \nstages of their proceedings, adequately investigate charges or hire investigators, file necessary \nmotions,  prepare  properly  for  court  appearances,  provide  meaningful  representation  at \nsentencings, or employ and consult with experts when necessary. Complaint ~ 8.  This pattern of \nineffective assistance harms defendants at every stage of their criminal proceedings.  The injuries \nto defendants are manifold, and include unnecessary or prolonged pretrial detention, excessive \ncharges, guilty pleas that were not knowing and voluntary, wrongful convictions, and excessive \nsentences.  Complaint ~ 9. \nlo  light of these allegations, the  Plaintiffs  have clearly stated  a claim  that  they  have \nsuffered - and are at imminent risk of continuing to suffer - violations of their right to counsel. \nIndeed. as the Plaintiffs detail in their merits brief, the right to counsel under the United States \nand Michigan constitutions protects the right to meaningful and effective assistance of counsel at \nall critical stages of a criminal prosecution.  This is the case even when the ineffective assistance \ndoes not ultimately lead to a wrongful conviction  but  rather injures defendants in  other ways, \nsuch as the wrongful  denial of bail or the failure to negotiate a favorable plea agreement.  See \nPlaintiffs'  Brief 22, 26-29.  The injuries described in the Complaint fall  squarely within these \nconstitutional protections. \nThe  State  has  urged  this  Court  to  narrow  the  constitutional  protections  afforded  to \ncriminal defendants, suggesting that a right to counsel claim exists only when a defendant has \nbeen wrongly convicted.  But this argument defies both Supreme Court precedent and common \nsense.  In  ROlhgery v GilleJpie County, the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that the Sixth \nAmendment  right  to  counsel  applies  during  all  critical  stages  of  a  criminal  prosecution, \n10 \n\n•  • \n2 \nprotecting defendants from a broad set of injuries of which wrongful conviction is only one. In \nthat case, Walter Rothgery sought damages pursuant to 42 USC § 1983, alleging that his right to \ncounsel was violated when Gillespie County failed  to  provide him with an  attorney within a \nreasonable time after his initial appearance, leading him to be incarcerated for three weeks when \nbail was set too high for him to afford. \nRothgery was never convicted of the crime for which he was charged (that he was a felon \nin possession ofa firearm); in fact, when he was finally appointed counsel, his attorney compiled \npaperwork that established that he had never been convicted of a felony and his indictment was \ntherefore dismissed.  But Rothgery nevertheless sought damages for the harm that the denial of \ncounsel had caused him, claiming that \"if the County had provided a la\"\"'Yer within a reasonable \ntime ... he would not have been indicted, rearrested, or jailed for three weeks.\"  fd at 2582-83. \nThe  Supreme  Court  held  that  Rothgery's  right  to  counsel  attached  at  his  initial \nappearance  before  a judicial  officer,  regardress  of  whether the  prosecutor  was  aware  of or \ninvolved in that appearance, vacating a Fifth Circuit opinion that held to the contrary.3  Although \nthe  Court did  not  reach the  question of whether  the  delay  in  appointing counsel resulted  in \nprejudice to  Rothgery's Sixth  Amendment rights,  it expressly  rejected the County's argument \nthat  \"prejudice  to  a  defendant's  pretrial  liberty\"  is  not  a  cognizable  harm  under  the  Sixth \n2 The State also points to Slrickland in support of its claim that a defendant must suffer a wrongful conviction to \nstate a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.  Amici  refer the Court to the Plaintiffs'  merits brief for a full \ndiscussion as to why Strickland's \"prejudice\" standard is directly related to the relief sought  in that case - the \noverturning of a criminal conviction - and is inapplicable to the kind of prospective relief that the Plaintiffs seek in \nthis case. See Plaintiffs' Brief26·29. \n3 Although Michigan provides for the  prompt appointment of counsel  by statute,  the Plaintiffs allege that most \nindigent defense counsel do not speak with their clients until after arraignment.  Complaint  131-32.  This is \ninsufficient to meet the requirements of the Sixth Amendment because, as ROlhgery observes, the attachment orthe \nright to counsel at the initiation of adverse judicial criminal proceedings \"is not 'mere formalism.'\" ROlhgery, 128 S \nCt at 2583.  In other words, \"[aJssistance begins with the appointment of counsel, it does not end there.\"  Uniled \nSIOles v Cronic, 466 US 648, 654; 104 S Ct 2039; 80 L Ed 2d 657 (J 984), quoling United States v Decoster, 199 US \nApp DC 359,382 (MacKinnon, J., concurring), cert. denied 444 US 944 (1979). \n1 I \n\n•  • \nAmendment.4  The Court dismissed this argument as \"mistaken,\" and its analysis emphasized not \nonly  Rothgery's  incarceration  but  also  the  impact  of the  later-dismissed  charge  on  his \nemployment prospects.  Id. at 2589. \nROlhgery  follows  an  extensive  history  of United  States  Supreme  Court  precedent \nrecognizing \"that a person accused of a crime 'requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step \nin  the  proceedings  against  him'  and  that  that  constitutional  principle  is  not  limited  to  the \npresence of counsel at trial.\" Coleman v Alabama, 399 US  1, 9; 90 S Ct 1999; 26 L Ed 2d 387 \n(1970) (plurality) (citing Powell v Alabama, 287 US 45, 69 (1932).  See also,  e.g., ESlelle v \nSmilh, 451 US 454, 470-71; 101 S Ct 1866; 68 L Ed 2d 359 (1981) (finding pre-trial psychiatric \nevaluation \"critical  stage\" and  failure  to involve defense counsel  violates Sixth  Amendment); \nUnited Stales v Wade, 388 US 218, 236-67; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L Ed 2d 1149 (1967) (finding line-\nup  identification procedure was \"critical stage\" such  that counsel's presence  was necessary to \nassure meaningful defense); White v Maryland, 373  US  59, 60; 83 S Ct  1050; 10 L Ed 2d  193 \n(1963) (finding preliminary hearing where defendants enter guilty pleas \"critical stage\"). \nTo limit defendants' right to counsel solely to cases where deficient representation led to \na wrongful conviction not only contravenes established precedent, but renects an impoverished \nview of the  role  of defense  counsel  in  the  adversarial criminal  justice  system.  Individuals \ncharged with crimes rely on effective counsel to protect their rights and interests in myriad ways \nand  at  every  stage  of their  criminal  proceedings.  As  the  American  Bar  Association  has \nrecognized,  \"[m]any important  rights of the accused can  be protected and  preserved only by \nprompt  legal action.  Defense counsel  should  inform  the  accused  of his  or her  rights at the \n4 Amici have ascertained the outcome of the case following the Supreme Court's remand.  Not surprisingly, the \nCounty reached a settlement with Mr.  Rothgery, compensating him $40,000 for his  three weeks of unnecessary \nconfinement.

To conclude that criminal defendants' \nrights are violated only if ineffective counsel leads to a wrongful conviction would be to carve \nout from judicial oversight much of the critical role that lawyers play in ensuring that defendants \nare treated fairly in criminal proceedings.  The right to counsel is nOl, and should not, be limited \nin such a fashion. \nB.  Such constitutional violations of the right to counsel cannot be remedied by \npost-conviction review, making Plaintiffs' suit for prospective relief both \nnecessary llnd appropriate. \nThe  Complaint  demonstrates  that  the  Plaintiffs  face  a  high  risk  of imminent  and \nirreparable harm, making a suit  for declaratory and injunctive relief urgent and necessary.  See \nComplaint,. 141; see also Higgins Lake Properly Owners Ass 'n  Gerrish Twp, 255 Mich App \nII \n83,  105-06; 662 NW2d 387 (2003) (\"Injunctive  relief is  an  extraordinary remedy that courts \nnormally grant only when (I) justice requires it, (2) there is no adequate remedy at law, and (3) \nthere exists a real and imminent danger of irreparable injury.\") (internal citations omitted). \nCritically. post-conviction review cannot remedy the injuries that the Plaintiffs argue they \nsuffer based on Michigan's deficient provision of indigent defense services.  First, as asserted in \nthe Complaint, much of the harm caused to criminal defendants by the absence of counselor by \nineffective assistance of counsel occurs at the pre-trial and pre-conviction stages of their criminal \nproceedings.  Post-conviction  review  affords  no  relief whatsoever to  such  injuries  because, \npursuant to Strickland, a defendant seeking to reverse a conviction must establish both that an \n\\3 \n\n•  • \nattorney's performance was inadequate and that there is a \"reasonable probability that, but for \ncounsel's [] errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  466 US at 694. \nFor example, post·conviction review cannot remedy the harm to defendants who  have \nexperienced prolonged pre-trial delay or pre-trial detention, the denial of bail or bail review, and \ns \nother  pretrial  injuries  due  to  ineffective  assistance  or  the  denial  of counsel. A  lawyer's \nadvocacy is a critical factor in determining whether arrestees are released shortly after their arrest \nor whether they  spend substantial  periods  of time  in  pretrial  incarceration.  See, Douglas  L. \nColbert, Ray Paternoster &  Shawn Bushway, Do Allorneys Really Maller?  The  Empirical and \nLegal Case for the Right of Counsel al Bail, 23  Cardozo  L Rev  1719,  1763 (2002).  In fact, \nresearchers in a Baltimore City study found that indigent arrestees represented by counsel were \nover two-and-a-halftimes as likely to be released all their own recognizance and spent less time \nin jail.  !d. at 1755.  Such injuries are particularly pronounced for defendants who are ultimately \nacquitted  or  whose  cases  are  dismissed,  but  who  nevertheless  lose  licenses,  homes, jobs, \neducation, lime, opportunity. and income as a result of the denial of prompt, effective assistance \nof counsel.  Such injuries are not regrettable collateral side effects of every criminal prosecution, \nbut  instead  stem  directly  from  the  deficiencies  detailed  in  the  complaint:  inadequate \ninvestigation, a lack of prompt communication, and overall ineffective representation. \nSimilarly, a defendant may suffer if an atlomey fails to negotiate a plea agreement and is \nlater convicted and sentenced  more harshly than  he  should or would have  been subject  to  a \nnegotiated plea.  Once again, Strickland offers no remedy to this very real harm.  Indeed. because \n~ To give one example of how  ineffective representation may result in  unnecessary incarceration, if a Michigan \nlawyer waives  a client's MeL 766.4  right  to  have  the  preliminary examination conducted within  14  days of \narraignment withoulthe client's knowledge or input, a defendant can be held in jail unnecessarily. The 14-day rule \nprotects against unwarranted pre-trial detention.  See People v Weston, 413 Mich 371, 376; 319 NW2d 537( 1982) \n(A \"preliminary examination functions, in part, as a screening device 10 insure that there is a basis for holding a \ndefendant to face a criminal charge.  A defendant against whom there is insufficient evidence to proceed should be \ncleared and released as soon as possible.\"). \n14 \n\n•  • \nthe  Strickland standard  was  designed  to  ensure  \"confidence  in  the  outcome\"  of a  criminal \nproceeding, 466 US at 694, there are numerous injuries and prejudices suffered as a result of the \ndenial of effective counsel that the Strickland formula can never, and indeed was never designed \nto, address. \nA second context in which post-conviction review under Strickland is inadequate occurs \nwhen a defendant was convicted because his or her lawyer fails to conduct a timely investigation \nand, as a result, critical evidence is permanently lost.  Under these circumstances, it is impossible \nto later establish that the outcome of the proceeding would  have been different with effective \nrepresentation.  For example, failure to promptly and comprehensively confer with a client may \nresult in the permanent loss of evidence that, if it still existed, could have demonstrated prejudice \nunder  Strick/and.  Crime  scenes  change.  wounds  heal,  memories  fade,  and  witnesses  -\nparticularly witnesses within a transient, indigent community - quite often disappear, and once \ngone,  no  amount  of post·collviction  review  can  ever  restore  them.  Indeed,  the  ABA  has \nrecognized that one of counsel's most important duties is to establish early and regular contact \nwith a criminally accused client so that vital evidence is not lost.  See ABA  Defense Attorneys \nFunction  Standard 4·3.2:  Interviewing  the  Client  (\"As soon  as  practicable,  defense  counsel \nshould seek to determine all relevant facts known to the accused. \"). \nThus,  an  attorney's  failure  to  investigate  a  case  or  to  develop  mitigating  evidence \ncommonly  results  in  an  inadequate  record  to  establish  a  nexus  between counsel's deficient \nrepresentation and the outcome of the case - as required under Strick/and - leaving convicted \ndefendants with no opponunity to chaJlenge the denial of their right to effective counsel.6  In \nfact, just in  the universe of cases in  which wrongful conviction has been established by DNA \n6 Moreover, if competent counsel is lacking at the outset, arguments in support of pre-trial release will never be \nmarshaled on a derendant's behalr, which can result in a plethora of collateral consequences to the individual. as \nwell as hamper preparation ora derense. \n15 \n\n•  • \nevidence, there is growing evidence that ineffective  representation not only leads to erroneous \nconviction, but also  forecloses meaningful appellate review.  See Justice Denied:  America's \nContinuing Neglect of Our Constitutional Right  to Counsel, Report of the National Right  to \nCounsel Committee of the Constitution  Project,7 at  44-47 (April  2009) (Recounting studies \nshowing that  irulOcent appellants rarely succeeded in challenging the false evidence supporting \ntheir wrongful  convictions); see also Brandon  L. Garrett, Judging Innocence, 108 Columbia L \nRev 55 (2008). \nFinally, even  when a defendant successfully overturns a conviction due  to  ineffective \nassistance  of counsel,  this  post-conviction  relief can  never  fully  remedy  the  harm  to  the \nindividual  from  a  wrongful  conviction  - particularly  a  conviction  involving  years  of \nincarceration.  A wrongful conviction can hurt a defendant, as well  as his or her family, friends, \nemployers, and  the  larger community,  in ways that  post-conviction relief can  never begin to \naddress.  See, e.g., The  Innocence  Project, Making  Up for  Losl  Time:  /.yhat  the  Wrongfitlly \nConvicted  Endure  and  How  fo  Provide  Fair  Compensation,  7-11,  available  at \nhup:!/ www.innocenceproject.orgidocslInnocence_ Project_Compensation_  Report. pdf (discussing \nthe psychological, physical, and financial obstacles that exonerated defendants face).  Moreover, \na decision overturning a conviction in an individual case does nothing to address the systemic \ndeficiencies that put the defendant at risk of a wrongful conviction in the first place, or tJlat place \nall  criminal defendants  in  the  Plaintiff class  at  imminent  risk of being denied  their right  to \neffective counsel in their criminal proceedings. \nThese limitations on the effectiveness of post-conviction remedies are precisely why the \njudicial branch  has equitable  power  to  issue  declaratory and  injunctive  relief in  response  to \nimminent and irreparable constitutional  injuries caused by systemic deficiencies.

Indeed. courts  in other jurisdictions \nhave allowed  right to counsel  cases seeking prospective  relief to  go  forward when systemic \ndefects allegedly caused ongoing injury.  See, e.g.,  Lav(lllee v Justices In Hampden Superior \nCOllrt, 442 Mass 228, 238; 812 NE2d 895 (2004) (\"Because the petitioners are seeking redress \nfor the ongoing violation of their fundamental constitutional right that affects  the manner in \nwhich the criminal case against them will  be prosecuted and defended, it  is enough that they \nhave  shown  a  violation  of  lhat  right  that  may  likely  result  in  irremediable  harm  if nOl \ncorrected.\"); Luckey v  Harris, 860  F2d  1012,  1017 (CA  II,  1988), rev'd 011  other grounds, \nLuckey  Miller,  976 F2d 673 (CA  II,  1992) (\"Prospective  relief is designed to  avoid future \n\\I \nharm.

As the Court of Appeals explained, if the Plaintiffs \"show that \ninstances of deficient perfonnance and denial of counsel are widespread and systemic and ... are \ncaused by weaknesses and problems in the court-appointed, indigent defense systems,\" and \"[i]f \nthe aggregate of haml reaches such a level as to  be pervasive and persistent (widespread and \nsystemic), the case is justiciable and declaratory relief is appropriate, as well as injunctive relief \n17 \n\n•  • \nto preclude future harm and constitutional violations that can reasonably be deemed imminent in \nlight of the existing aggregate ofhann.\"  Duncan v Slale, 284 Mich App 246, 303; 774 NW2d 89 \n(2009). \nThe Sixth Amendment right protects the accused regardless of guilt or innocence, race, or \neconomic status.  Paradoxically, it is the countless innocent and wrongly accused persons, now \nand in the future, who will suffer the greatest harm if this court forecloses a cause of action for \nprospective relief.  Surely, the people of Michigan deserve better. \nII.  The failure to provide adequate indigent defense services disproportionately \nburdens communities of color. \nMichigan's  failure  to  provide  adequate  indigent  defense  services  has  a  particularly \nsignificant impact upon the AfricanNAmerican community.  African Americans are more likely \nto live in povet1y and, thus, are more likely to depend on appointed counsel. African Americans \nare almost five times more likely to rely on representation from appointed counsel than whites \nand two times more likely than Latinos.8  As a result, African Americans bear a disproportionate \nburden of the failure to provide adequate indigent defense services.9 \nThe consequences of the  failure to provide adequate indigent defense services, and  its \nbroad and disproportionate impact on communities of color, are well-documented and dramatic. \nA disproportionate number of people who are arrested - and particularly those in custody - are \nAfrican American.  Nationally, African Americans comprise 13% of the population but 28% of \nS Christopher Hartney &  Linh Vuong.

In 2007, people of color comprised 19% of Michigan's population, but accounted for \n55% of the state prison population. II  Not surprisingly, the disparity also extends to Michigan's \nyouth.  Of the 2,760 youths in residential placement in Michigan in 2006, 47.1 % were African \n12 \nAmerican; 4% were Latino, and 43.8% were white. This disturbingly high rate of African· \nAmerican incarceration. which is partially due to a failure to provide adequate representation to \nthe indigent, is an epidemic that violates constitutional safeguards and demands attention. \nA 2005 study by the Sentencing Project found that not only were African Americans and \nLatinos more likely to rely on appointed counsel, but that the hiring of a private attorney tended \n13 \nto result in less severe sentences. A 20 I 0 study of capital cases in Harris County, Texas, found \nthat  the  District  Attorney  was  substantially  more  likely  to  seek  the  death  penalty  against \ndefendants with appointed counsel as compared  to derendants who hired private counsel, and \nthat for cases in which the death penalty was pursued, a capital sentence was imposed in over \n80% or the cases where derendants had appointed counsel and not once imposed in cases where \ndefendants had private counseLl\" \nPossibly the most stark and direct example or how the  railure to  provide the poor with \nadequate derense counsel has real and disproportionate consequences on African Americans is \n10 Hartney & Vuong, at II, 14. \nII U.S. Census Bureau, 2007 American Community Survey; Michigan Department of Corrections, 2007 Annual \nReport. \n12 Children's Defense Fund, \"Cradle to Prison Pipeline - Michigan Fact Sheel\" 2009.

A 2004 study by the  lnnocence  Project  identified  328 \nexonerations  nationwide  between  1989  and  2004.  Of  these  persons,  55%  were  African \nAmerican and  13% were Hispanic.  For exonerations on rape charges, 64% of those wrongfully \nconvicted were African-American.  Many of these wrongful convictions are directly attributable \nto failures of indigent defense systems. \nThese  failures,  and  particularly  the  disproportionate  burden  of  the  failures  borne  by \ncommunities of color, harm not only the individual defendants, but also the community-at-large. \nIncarceration plays a role in constructing the meaning afrace by defining race and crime in terms \nof each  other - the  disproportionate  rates  of incarceration  have  made  the  image  of  black \ncriminality a social reality.15  Study after study supports the notion that \"[w]hen citizens perceive \nthe state to be furthering injustice ... they are less likely to obey the law, assist law enforcement, \nor enforce the law themselves.,,]6  This cycle of distrust and hostility is fueled by communities' \nperception of two systems of justice, one for people with means and an inferior system for the \ndisproportionately minority poor.  This community impression is reinforced by defense allorneys \nill-equipped  to  assist  their  clients  properly,  and,  once  agalll.  African  Americans \ndisproportionately suffer  the consequences.  Indeed. the evidence of pervasive and systematic \nharms  further  demonstrates  that  the  case-by-case,  post-conviction  standard  of Strick/and  is \ninappropriate to address the systematic deprivation of the right to counsel that particularly affects \ncommunities of color. \nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above, this Court should hold that where systemic \ndeficiencies create an imminent and irreparable risk that indigent defendants will be deprived of \nIS R.

      "text": "Rick Snyder \nGovernor \nThe Honorable Rick Snyder \nGovernor \nThe Honorable Randy Richardville \nMichigan Senate \nThe Honorable James Bolger \nMichigan House of Representatives \nDear Sirs: \nThe Indigent Defense Advisory Commission has completed its work, ahead of schedule, and has \nissued the attached report. We all appreciated the opportunity to serve our state in this important \nendeavor. \nThe Commission was a very diverse group representing all major stakeholders on this issue, and \nour members hold a wide range of political views. However, the Commission was unanimous in \nacknowledging the importance of the 6th Amendment Right to Counsel as a bedrock value of our \ncriminal justice system, and we all believe that our current system of indigent defense could be \nimproved. \nEnsuring competent and fairly compensated defense attorneys for all persons accused of a \ncrime is a very difficult issue, and problems in this area have been recognized by a number of groups \nthat have previously studied indigent defense systems in Michigan. We believe that our core \nrecommendation that an independent and permanent Indigent Defense Commission, with authority to \nestablish and enforce minimum standards for indigent defense across the state, represents a practical \nway to begin to address the problems that have been identified in this area. It is also consistent with the \ndual goals of maintaining local control and responsibility, while making sure that all areas of our state \nprovide adequate indigent defense services. \nI would like to acknowledge the time, effort, and cooperation by the members of the \ncommission. It has been gratifying to work with them, and we could not have completed our task on \ntime without their dedication. It is our hope that the legislature will see the importance of adopting \nthese recommendations, and we know that our great state can provide better and more effective \n1 \n\n+ \nu \nrepresentation for those charged with crimes in the future. \nVe~TrulyYours,  ~ \nChairman, Michigan Advisory Commission on Indigent Defense \n2 \n\nReport of the Michigan Advisory Commission on Indigent Defense \nJune 22, 2012 \nOVERVIEW \nGovernor Rick Snyder signed Executive Order 2011-12 on October 13, 2011 establishing \nthe Michigan Advisory Commission on Indigent Defense. The Commission was charged with the \nfollowing responsibilities: \nA.  \"The Commission shall analyze existing data that is needed to assist policymakers in \nmaking decisions on the appropriate funding and staffing levels to ensure effective \npublic criminal defense services. \nB.  The Commission shall make recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature \nfor  improvements  to  the  system  of providing  legal  representative  for  indigent \ncriminal defendants, as follows: \n1.  The  improvements must be  fiscally responsible,  cost-effective,  and  take into \naccount  the  current  economic  conditions  of the  state  and  local  units  of \ngovernment. \n2.  The  improvements  must  be  responsive  to  jurisdictional  variances  and  local \ncommunity needs. \n3.  The  improvements  must  ensure  that  indigent  defense  is  free  from  undue \npolitical interference and conflicts of interest. \n4.  The improvements must seek to ensure that the right to counsel is delivered by \neffective counsel at each critical stage of the proceedings in a manner that is \nconsistent throughout the state. \nS.  The  improvement  must  aspire  to  ensure  that  government-funded  criminal \ndefense  attorneys  are  sufficiently  trained  and  supervised,  appropriately \nqualified, and adequately compensated.\" \nMembers of the commission  were  appointed  by the Governor with  terms expiring \nDecember 2012 and they served at the pleasure of the Governor: James Fisher (Chairman), The \nHonorable Thomas Boyd, The Honorable Colleen O'Brien, The Honorable Bruce Caswell, The \nHonorable Bert Johnson, The Honorable Tom McMillin, the Honorable Ellen Cogen Lipton, John \nShea,  Ronald  Schaefer, Andrew Richner,  Maggie Jones, Judith Gracey,  Michael  Brown, and \nSuzanne Sareini. \n3 \n\nANALYSIS \nThe  Commission  extensively  reviewed  a  variety  of  existing  data,  resources  and \nviewpoints  from  within  and  outside  of  Michigan.  Additionally,  Chairman  James  Fisher \nconvened two subcommittees to consider policy and finance. \nIn June 2008, the National legal Aid & Defender Association issued a report at the \nbehest of the Michigan legislature in which the Association concluded that Michigan ranked, \nwhen compared with all states, both with and without capital punishment, to be 44th in per \ncapita spending on indigent defense representation.  David J. Carroll, the Director of Research \nand Evaluation for the NADLA at the time of the report, was invited to and did speak before the \nCommission and participated in subcommittee meetings in an advisory capacity. \nThe commission undertook a survey of all of the State Court Administrative Office, the \nadministrators, and the Chief Judges of each Michigan Circuit and District Court to obtain data \nregarding their individual local, indigent defense systems. \nIn January of 2012, the Commission invited Peter Ozanne of the Crime and Justice \nInstitute and Nancy Cozine of Oregon's Office of Public Defense Services to present to the \ncommission the evolution of Oregon's indigent defense system. The Commission next invited \nFrank X. Neuner of the Louisiana Public Defender Board and Laborde & Neuner to report on the \nState of Louisiana's reformation of the criminal indigent defense system in the past decade. The \ninformation presented was informative on budget, administrative, and legislative policy issues. \nData on file with the State Court Administrator's Office provided statistical data on \nspending per Circuit Court and District Court. \nThe public was invited and encouraged to testify.  Data and opinion was presented by \nthe Michigan State Bar, the Michigan Judges Association, the Michigan District Judges \nAssociation, the State Appellate Defender Office, Criminal Defense Association of Michigan, the \nMichigan Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan, the Campaign for Justice, the Kent \nCounty Public Defender's Office,  Michigan Council on Crime and Delinquency, Oakland County \nCourt Administrator, Michigan Association of Counties, the Bay County Public Defender's Office, \nthe National Association of Black Lawyers, the University of Michigan Innocence Clinic,  the \nLegal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the Chippewa County Public Defense Office, the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, the Michigan Council of Professional Investigators, Wayne \nCounty Prosecutor's Office, the Wayne County Criminal Defense Association, the Washtenaw \nCounty Public Defender, and the Michigan Catholic Conference, among others. \nThe following are the Commission's Findings and Recommendations that were the result \nof this analysis. \n4 \n\nFINDINGS \n1.  Article I, Section 24 of the Michigan Constitution provides that victims of crime have the \nright to the \"timely disposition of the case following the arrest of the accused.\" \n2.  Article  I,  Section  20  of the  Michigan  Constitution  provides that people  accused  in \ncriminal prosecutions have the right \"to have the assistance of counsel for his or her \ndefense.\"  In  accordance with the state's obligation  under the Sixth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments  of  the  United  States  Constitution,  a  competent  attorney  shall  be \nappointed to all people facing a potential loss of liberty in a criminal prosecution who \ncannot without substantial hardship afford private counsel. \n3.  Accordingly, it is the obligation of the state to ensure that criminal trials are fair and \naccurate, and that the results are swift and final.  This must be the case not only for the \nvictim and the accused in a particular crime, but for all of us for whom the courts are the \nbulwark of a safe, secure and fair society. \n4.  To achieve that aim it is the obligation of the state to ensure for the general framework \nand the resources necessary to provide for the delivery of public defender services in \nthis state. The state of Michigan has historically delegated its responsibilities under the \nUnited States and Michigan constitutions to local funding units.  While a state may \ndelegate obligations imposed by the constitution it must do so in a manner that does \nnot abdicate the constitutional duty it owes to the people.  It is the state's obligation to \nensure that local funding units meet the constitutional obligations. \n5.  Nothing in the Commission's work should be construed to overrule, expand, or extend, \neither directly or by analogy, the decision reached by the United States Supreme Court \nin Strickland v. Washington, 466 US 688 (1984}, nor its progeny adopted by the Michigan \nSupreme Court. \n6.  The obligation to provide counsel to indigent defendants belongs to the State, not the \ncounties.  However, Michigan's history has been to leave it to the counties to meet this \nState obligation. The result has been an uncoordinated, 83-county patchwork quilt of \nservice delivery systems, with each county's \"system\" dependent on its own \ninterpretation of what is adequate and on its own funding availability. \n7.  At present, there are no promulgated state-wide standards for defining and ensuring \nconstitutionally adequate defense counsel for indigent defendants. Therefore, the \ncounties have had no regulatory guidance as to what their service delivery systems \nshould provide. \n5 \n\n8.  As a direct result of Finding 6 and  Finding 7, the availability, quality, and funding \nresources of county-provided indigent defense services at the trial level varies greatly \nacross the State. \n9.  The American Bar Association has developed a set of standards for providing trial-level \nindigent defense services, entitled \"Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System,\" \na copy of which are attached. While indigent defense systems have been studied by \nmany and for many years, the ABA Ten Principles is a concise statement of minimum \nstandards required for operation of such a system consistent with the United States \nConstitution. \n10. In June 2008, a study by the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA) of \ntrial-level indigent defense services, commissioned by the Legislature of 10 counties \nchosen by a legislator-convened advisory group, found that none of those counties met \nthese minimum standards.  While some persons providing testimony before the \nCommission defended their own local systems, on balance the testimony presented to \nthe Commission from Michigan indigent defense practitioners, judges, and prosecutors \n(including those defending their own systems) confirmed that the ABA Ten Principles \nare not met in Michigan. \n11. Common examples of the ways in which these minimum standards are not met include \nlocal systems that are not independent of the judiciary, that do not control for attorney \nworkload, and that do not match an attorney's training and experience to the nature \nand complexity of the case.  Additionally, few local systems of which the Commission \nwas made aware required continued legal education of its defense attorneys or systems \nto evaluate performance.  Finally, a uniform complaint was that the local systems were \nsignificantly underfunded. \n12. The NLADA study found that Michigan ranked 44th out of the 50 states in terms of per \ncapita funding for trial-level indigent defense services, with its per capita spending on \nsuch services 38% less than the national average, at approximately $74,000,000. \nTestimony presented to the Commission indicated that Michigan's indigent defense \nservice delivery system is significantly underfunded.  Further, the underfunding is \npervasive, meaning it impacts all aspects of the defense function. It would require \nadditional support of nearly $50,000,000 to bring our state up to the national average. \nCurrently, only 3 of our 57 circuit courts supports indigent defense at or above the \nnational average, and many provide only a fraction of the national average. \n13. The Commission finds that Michigan should create a system that requires and ensures \nfull, consistent, and state-wide implementation of those minimum standards, and \nadequate funding authorized by the Legislature for that system. \n6 \n\n14. In furtherance of Finding 13, the Commission finds that a new and independent State \nagency, governed by a permanent Commission, is necessary, which agency's and \nCommission's mission would be to promulgate and enforce standards applicable \nstatewide for providing trial-level indigent defense services consistent with the ABA Ten \nPrinciples. \n15. The Commission's study was limited to trial-level indigent defense services for crimes \ncharged in the adult system.  However, at various times issues arose regarding defense \nservices for indigent persons charged in the Michigan's juvenile system.  The \nCommission finds that an assessment of the juvenile defense system, which has a \ndistinctly different structure and purpose than adult courts, is needed to ensure that the \nconstitutional rights of Michigan's youngest citizens are upheld, and recommends that \nthe Governor appoint a separate study commission focused on that system. \n16. The Commission did not consider and does not recommend changes to the Appellate \nDefender Act or the infrastructure of the appellate defense delivery system. \n17. The State Bar of Michigan has adopted and endorses the ABA Ten Principles as its own. \nIn addition, the SBM has adopted an 11th Principle which calls for \"defender offices,\" to \n\"explore and advocate for programs that improve the system and reduce recidivism.\" \nThe Commission finds that Michigan's indigent defense system should, in some \nmeaningful way, incorporate this principle within the mission of the State agency that \nthe Commission recommends be created. \n18. The Commission finds that criminal defense interests are often unrepresented in \nstatewide criminal justice policy and planning bodies created by the courts, legislature \nand executive.  Criminal justice system policy-making bodies should include criminal \ndefense representatives, to ensure more representative results. \n19. The Commission finds that there is a lack of quality, consistent data collection for \nindigent defense across the state.  Data is an essential component to a transparent \nsystem; it ensures that the state is accountable to citizens for the use of their tax dollars \nand helps identify where the problems may exist. The new commission will serve as the \ncentralized data collector and will ensure that standardized data from each county is \ncollected. Current data varies so much that it has not been useful to report caseloads or \nother information. \n20. The Commission addressed the issue of judicial independence in Recommendation #4 \n(1). The Commission finds that the permanent commission created in statute should add \nprotections to ensure and protect the independence of attorneys. The Commission \nheard testimony that individual attorneys have suffered repercussions for raising \nconcerns about compliance with national standards, including those related to caseload. \nLawyers should not face discipline or be subject to repercussions for complying with \nprofessional and ethical responsibilities.  Additionally, public defenders should be free \n7 \n\nto give truthful statements about their work conditions and the aspects of their \npractices that are not subject to attorney-client privilege. \n21. The commission was provided data from the Appellate Division of the Attorney \nGeneral's Office, the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, and the State Appellate \nDefender Office regarding ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims {IATC).  The \nAppellate Division of the Attorney General's Office represents the 56 smallest Michigan \ncounties in criminal appeals through the Prosecuting Attorney Appellate Service (PAAS) \nand provided six years of data. Wayne County is the State's most populous county and \nis responsible for more criminal cases, by a wide margin, than any other county and \nprovided four years of data. SADO represents indigent appellate defendants each year, \nin cases from all counties, and provided 15 years of data. There could be many e#leF \nissues raised on appeal that, although they are not labeled as Ineffective Assistance of \nTrial Counsel, they are essentially caused by an attorney's inadequate performance, or a \nlack of sufficient resources. The commission finds ineffective assistance of trial counsel \nclaims that result in reversal of a criminal conviction are not common in Michigan but \nare not necessarily the only indicator of a well-functioning system. \n22. A result of the many different public defense delivery systems, varying interpretations of \nwhat is adequate and inconsistent funding availability, the current delivery of indigent \ndefense results in a public defense system that is too often subject to errors at the trial \nlevel, and at its worst, results in a wrongful conviction. Michigan taxpayers are exposed \nto millions of dollars in unnecessary expense in these most egregious cases. \nAdditionally, the commission was provided data from SADO that indicated avoidable \nsentencing errors cost Michigan taxpayers millions of dollars annually. An indigent \ndefense system that provides for minimum standards and adequate and reliable funding \nshould ensure attorneys are trained and competent to handle a criminal case from \nbeginning to end thus ensuring quality representation to the indigent and potentially \nsubstantial savings to Michigan taxpayers by eliminating trial level and sentencing \nerrors. \n23. The commission finds that Michigan's current system of providing legal representation \nfor indigent criminal defendants lacks procedural safeguards to ensure effective public \ncriminal defense services. \n8 \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \nRecommendation #1 \nThe Michigan Indigent Defense Advisory Commission recommends that the Michigan \nLegislature create a permanent commission on Indigent Defense. \nRecommendation #2 \nThe permanent commission should be given the authority to establish and enforce \nminimum standards statewide for the delivery of constitutionally effective assistance of \ncounsel to indigent criminal defendants.  The commission shall also identify and \nencourage best practices for creation and operation of such a delivery system. \nRecommendation #3 \nMichigan should continue its tradition of providing indigent defense through local \ndelivery systems.  Legislation creating and enabling a permanent indigent defense \ncommission should mandate that local systems must comply with statewide standards \nestablished by the commission. As long as local systems comply with state standards, \nthey may utilize various methods of their choosing. \nRecommendation #4 \nThe Michigan Legislature should adopt and incorporate the following as the guiding \nstandards for the permanent commission and all local systems providing counsel to \nindigent criminal defendants. \n1.  The public defense function, including the selection, funding, and payment of \ndefense counsel, is independent of the judiciary while assuring that local judges be \nallowed meaningful input. \n2.  Where the case load is sufficiently high, the public defense delivery system \nconsists of both a defender office and the active participation of the private bar.  The \npermanent commission shall give deference where a local system is otherwise \ncompliant with the remaining 9 principles articulated here. \n9 \n\n3.  Clients are screened for eligibility and defense counsel is assigned as soon as \nfeasible after formal charges are filed.  The commission shall determine what indigency \nmeans on a statewide basis. \n4.  Defense counsel is provided sufficient time and a confidential space within which \nto meet with the client. \n5.  Defense counsel's workload is controlled to permit the rendering of quality \nrepresentation.  Each local system must take affirmative steps to avoid the creation of \neconomic disincentives or incentives that threaten to impair the provision of effective \nassistance of counsel.  Local systems should be given latitude to develop workload \ncontrols that assure effective assistance of counsel. \n6.  Defense counsel's ability, training, and experience match the nature and \ncomplexity of the case. \n7.  The same individual attorney continuously represents and personally appears at \nevery court appearance from beginning to end.  Local systems should be allowed to \nexempt ministerial, non-substantive tasks and hearings from this rule. \n8.  Defense attorneys are equal partners in the criminal justice system.  The defense \nfunction, as with all criminal justice functions, should be adequately funded so it can \nfulfill its particular role. \n9.  Defense counsel is provided with and required to attend relevant continuing \nlegal education. \n10.  Defense counsel is systematically reviewed for quality and competence \naccording to standards adopted by the permanent commission. \nRecommendation #5 \nThe permanent commission should be an autonomous entity within the judicial branch \nof state government. \nRecommendation #6 \nTo assure independence of the permanent commission the appointing authority should \nbe balanced between the three branches of government. This balance should be \nrealized through appointments by the Governor from recommendations of others. This \napproach is consistent with Michigan's history, traditions and current practices. \n10 \n\n1.  Specifically, the permanent commission should have 13 members and should be \nestablished as follows: \na.  2 members submitted by the Speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives; \nb.  2 members submitted by the Majority Leader of the Michigan Senate; \nc.  1 member from a list of 3 names submitted by the Chief Justice of the Michigan \nSupreme Court; \nd.  2 members from a list of 6 names submitted by the Criminal Defense Attorney \nAssociation of Michigan; \ne.  1 member from a list of 3 names submitted by the Michigan Judges Association; \nf.  1 member from a list of 3 names submitted by the Michigan District Judges \nAssociation; \ng.  1 member from a list of 3 names submitted by the State Bar of Michigan; \nh.  1 member from names submitted by bar associations whose primary mission or \npurpose is to advocate for minority interests; \ni.  1 member selected by the Governor from the general public; \nj.  1 member selected by the Governor from local government; and \nk.  The Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court, or his or her designee, should \nserve as an ex-officio member of the permanent commission. \n2.  Individuals nominated for service on the permanent commission shall have \nsignificant experience in the defense of criminal proceedings or shall have demonstrated \na strong commitment to quality representation in indigent defense matters. At least two \nmembers must be non-attorneys. \n3.  Each commissioner should be appointed to serve a four-year term. \n4.  Legislation creating the permanent commission should stagger these terms so \napproximately Y-1 of the terms expire each year. \n5.  Vacancies on the permanent commission should be filled in the same manner as \nthe original appointments with the nominating source submitting 3 names for each \nvacant position. \n11 \n\n6.  Persons receiving compensation through the state or any local system for \nproviding representation to or prosecution of indigent defendants in state courts shall \nnot serve on the permanent commission. \n7.  The Governor shall appoint one of the permanent commission's original13 \nmembers to serve as chair for one year.  Thereafter, the permanent commission \nmembers shall annually elect a chairperson from their membership to serve a one-year \nterm.  No person should be allowed to serve as commission chair for more than three \nconsecutive one-year terms. \n8.  No more than 3 sitting or retired judges shall serve on the Commission at one \ntime. \n9.  The Governor shall have authority to reject any list of nominations that are \nsubmitted and has the authority to ask for additional names. \nRecommendation #7 \nTransparency and accountability being pillars of an effective system, the permanent \ncommission and its staff should be subject to the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL \n15.261 to 15.275, and the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to \n15.246. \nRecommendation #8 \nThe permanent commission's authority and/or responsibility should include, but not \nnecessarily be limited to, the following: \n1.  Develop and oversee the implementation and enforcement of standards, rules \nand procedures to ensure that effective assistance of counsel is consistently delivered \nstatewide to individuals in trial level adult criminal proceedings in accordance with the \nU.S. Constitution, the Michigan Constitution, and the provisions of this act. This includes \nthe authority to modify such standards, rules and procedures as the commission deems \nadvisable.  Particular attention should be paid to juveniles being adjudicated in the adult \nsystem.  In addition, the commission should encourage a coordinated effort with other \nagencies to deliver appropriate defense to individuals with mental impairments. \n2.  Investigate, audit and review the operation of local indigent defense delivery \nsystems to assure compliance with standards, rules and procedures of the commission. \n12 \n\nParticipation in and cooperation with such review shall be mandatory for each local \nsystem. \n3.  Hire an Executive Director and determine the appropriate number of staff \nneeded to accomplish the commission's mandate consistent with annual appropriations. \n4.  Charge the Executive Director with establishment of an organizational chart; \npreparation of an annual budget; hiring, discipline and firing of staff; \n5.  Charge the Executive Director and staff with assisting it in developing, \nimplementing, regularly reviewing and enforcing the commission's standards, rules and \nprocedures. \n6.  Establish procedures for the receipt and resolution of complaints, and the \nimplementation of recommendations from the courts, other participants in the criminal \njustice system, clients and members of the public. \n7.  Establish procedures for the mandatory collection of data concerning operation \nof the commission, each individual attorney representing indigent defendants and each \nlocal indigent defense system. \n8.  Establish procedures for annually reporting to the Governor, Legislature and \nSupreme Court.  The annual report shall include any recommendations for further \nlegislation. \n9.  The first annual report shall include an implementation time line. This timeline \nshould include both projections for establishing minimum statewide standards and \nestimates for bringing each local system into compliance. The timeline should be \nupdated annually until such time as all local systems are expected to be in compliance. \nRecommendation 119 \nLegislation creating the permanent commission should include procedural safeguards \nfor local systems.  A local system must be afforded an opportunity to be heard by the \npermanent commission before it is found in non-compliance. A local system must be \nafforded reasonable time to come into compliance with the minimum standards after \ndefect(s) are formally identified by the permanent commission and communicated to \nthe local system. The permanent commission should be empowered to provide indigent \ndefense services directly with state resources should any local system fail to meet the \nminimum standards for the delivery of constitutionally effective assistance of counsel to \nindigent criminal defendants. The legislature should authorize the State Treasurer to \n13 \n\nwithhold an amount equal to the cost of providing local indigent defense services from \nany and all state payments to such local unit of government. \nRecommendation #10 \nSince indigent defense is a state obligation, justice system funding is a shared \nresponsibility for the state and local government, and the current trial level indigent \ndefense is 100% locally funded, any new funding requirements should be fulfilled by the \nstate.  Each local government should be required to maintain at least the same level of \nfunding for indigent defense services, adjusted for inflation, as the average expended \nannually in the three fiscal years preceding creation of the permanent commission (with \na minimum of $7.25 per capita}. State funding should be made available through the \nannual appropriations process at times and in amounts necessary to meet the \ndemonstrated and quantified needs of local systems to meet the minimum standards \nestablished. \nRecommendation #11 \nThe permanent commission should be authorized to seek and receive grants from the \nfederal government, from private and public foundations, or from any other source. \nRecommendation #12 \nThe legislature should appropriate the permanent commission sufficient funds at its \ncreation to hire staff, establish minimum standards and begin the collection of data \nfrom all local systems and individual attorneys providing indigent defense. The \npermanent commission should establish metrics, to the extent feasible, for determining \nthe resources necessary for each local system to comply with the minimum standards \nand for determining the resources necessary for the permanent commission to fulfill its \nrole.  The permanent commission should establish a timeline for local systems to comply \nwith statewide minimum standards consistent with these metrics and state \nappropriations. \n14 \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe Commission would like to acknowledge the following individuals and organizations \nfor lending their expertise, talent, and resources.
