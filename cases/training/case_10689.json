    "summary": "<p>On August 19, 1994, represented by private counsel, a group of prison visitors filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of  Maine, challenging the strip-search policies of the Maine Correctional Center relative to prison visitors.  They claimed they were subjected to unconstitutional strip searches by prison officials when the plaintiffs attempted to visit their incarcerated relatives.  Plaintiffs sought damages, declaratory and injunctive relief and certification on behalf of a statewide class of individuals affected by the alleged strip-search policies of the Maine Correctional Center.</p><p>Prison officials denied the allegations and maintained that the searches were lawful as they had received information from a confidential information (and, mistakenly, believed the information had been corroborated) that plaintiffs were attempting to smuggle drugs into the prison.  On November 3, 1994, the plaintiffs sought to file an amended complaint, seeking the same relief and alleging constitutional violations and common law torts arising out of the strip searches.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and plaintiffs moved for class certification and leave to file the second amended complaint.  </p><p>The pretrial motions were referred to U.S. Magistrate Judge Eugene W. Beaulieu.  On September 29, 1995, he issued his report recommending granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment and denying the plaintiffs' motions for class certification and for leave to file the amended complaint.  </p><p>On December 8, 1995, in an unpublished order, the district court (Judge D. Brock Hornby) adopted the recommendations of the magistrate judge and entered summary judgment in favor of the defendant prison officials, finding that they were entitled to qualified immunity.  Plaintiffs appealed.  The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (Circuit Judge Sandra Lea Lynch) affirmed, holding that (1) constitutionality of prison-visitor strip searches was governed by the standard of reasonable suspicion, and (2) on the facts presented (reasonable reliance on a mistaken report by an experienced staff member, with no evidence of deliberate or systematic misreporting),  the prison officials were entitled to qualified immunity.  Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922 (1st Cir. 1996).</p><p>No further action by the parties took place in this case.</p><p></p>",

CLEMONS et al., Defendants, Appellees.\nNo. 96-1078.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.\nHeard June 3, 1996.\nDecided July 22, 1996.\n992234 *923*924 John S. Whitman, with whom Richardson, Whitman, Large & Badger was on brief, Portland, ME, for\nappellants.\nDiane Sleek, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Andrew Ketterer, Attorney General of Maine, was on brief,\nAugusta, ME, for appellees.\nBefore TORRUELLA, Chief Judge, CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, and LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.\nOfficers at a Maine prison received a tip that a female inmate's teenage children would be smuggling drugs into\nthe prison in her infant granddaughter's booties. The superintendent of the prison, erroneously believing that the\ntip had been confirmed by two unconnected confidential informants, authorized a strip search of the visitors. In\nactuality, the tip had originated from a single anonymous and uncorroborated source. The strip search of the\nplaintiff minors turned up no drugs. Plaintiffs brought suit against the superintendent and the Commissioner of the\n925 Maine Department of Corrections under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.[1] The sole question on appeal *925 is whether the\ndistrict court correctly entered summary judgment on the plaintiffs' damages claim in favor of the superintendent\nbased on his assertion of the qualified immunity defense. We conclude that the constitutionality of prison-visitor\nstrip searches is governed by the standard of reasonable suspicion and that a reasonable official in the\nsuperintendent's position could have believed, in light of the information before him, that the searches did not\nviolate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Accordingly, we affirm.\nI\nThe record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, reveals the following. Since September of 1993,\nSharon Wood had been an inmate at the Maine Correctional Center (\"MCC\") in Windham, Maine, serving a\nthree-year term of confinement for a drug-related conviction. From the time she was first incarcerated there, she\nwas visited approximately every other week by her son Phillip Thamert (then seventeen years of age), her\ndaughter Katrina Thamert (then sixteen), and Phillip's girlfriend Michelle Hatch (then seventeen). On each visit,\nKatrina brought along her infant daughter Maria (then seven months old). Nothing happened during any of these\nvisits to arouse any suspicion of illegal activity on the part of Wood or her visitors. Wood had no record of drug\nviolations while at the MCC.\nThe events leading to the strip search of Wood's visitors began with a telephone call to the MCC by Detective\nPeter Herring, the State Police Department's appointed liaison to the prison. On a \"large number\" of previous\noccasions, Herring had provided MCC officials with information obtained from his own confidential sources about\ncriminal activity at the prison. Herring's information had invariably turned out to be accurate in the past.\nOn January 5, 1994, Herring called the MCC to provide another tip. Corrections Officers Charles Baker and\nStephen Butts, both responsible for criminal investigations within the MCC, fielded Herring's call together. Herring\ntold Baker and Butts that he had obtained information that inmate Sharon Wood was receiving drugs from the\noutside. Herring said that he had been told by a confidential informant who, in turn, had heard from an\n\nanonymous source that Wood was receiving drugs during visits, and that the drugs were being smuggled into the\nprison in her infant granddaughter's booties. Herring disclosed to Baker and Butts that he had obtained this\ninformation on a secondhand basis, and that at no time had Herring spoken directly to the original anonymous\nsource about the tip. Herring himself had no personal knowledge of Sharon Wood or the persons who were\nsupposedly bringing drugs to her. Herring did not provide Baker or Butts with the name of either his confidential\n[2]\ninformant or the original source of the tip.\nSoon after the phone call, Officer Baker prepared a written report of the conversation with Herring. Baker's report,\nhowever, contained an important inaccuracy. That inaccuracy may be what ultimately allowed the strip search to\ntake place. The report implied that the information about Wood had been provided to Herring by two independent,\nmutually corroborating confidential informants:\nDet Peter Herring advised Butts and Baker that he received information from two separate CI's\nthat prisoner Sharon Wood (Dorm 2) is allegedly receiving drugs during visits. Supposedly, the\ndrugs are hidden in Wood's granddaughter's booties. Security projects office to monitor and will\nrequest appropriate action when required.\nThus, by indicating that two unconnected \"CI's\" 00 confidential informants 00 had provided Detective Herring with\n97 97\n926 the same information, *926 Baker's report significantly overrepresented the actual reliability of Herring's tip.\nFive days later, on January 10, 1994, defendant James R. Clemons, Superintendent of the MCC, met with Baker\nand Butts to conduct their regular weekly review of security matters at the prison. At this meeting, Clemons read\nBaker's report of the information received from Detective Herring. It is undisputed that, as a result of reviewing\nthe report, Clemons came to believe in good faith that two separate confidential sources had provided Herring\nwith precisely the same tip concerning drug-smuggling by Sharon Wood's visitors. Clemons signed Baker's report\nto acknowledge that he had reviewed it and to confirm that the security projects office run by Baker and Butts\nwould monitor the situation and notify Clemons if and when any further action became appropriate. Following the\nJanuary 10 meeting, no one at the MCC, including Clemons, conducted any additional investigation or follow-up\nconcerning the Herring tip. No action was taken on the tip prior to the plaintiffs' next visit to the MCC.\nThat visit came on February 22, 1994. At 10:00 a.m. that morning, Officer Baker noticed the names of Wood's\nchildren on the prison visitor schedule for that day. Recalling the phone conversation with Peter Herring on\nJanuary 5, Baker paged Superintendent Clemons, who was at his home, to request authorization to conduct a\nstrip search of the visitors based on the Herring tip. About twenty minutes later, Clemons responded to Baker's\npage and authorized a strip search of Wood's scheduled visitors. Baker then called Detective Herring to inform\nhim of the impending search. Herring agreed to stand by in case arrests had to be made.\nKatrina and Phillip Thamert, Katrina's baby, and Michelle Hatch arrived at the prison at about 1:20 p.m. After\nKatrina, Phillip and Michelle signed in, Officer Baker and another officer took them aside and told them that they\nwould have to submit to a search for contraband drugs before they would be permitted to see Sharon Wood.\nBaker read a \"consent to search\" form to the visitors, advising them of their constitutional rights to refuse to give\nconsent and to require the prison to obtain search warrants, and to withdraw consent at any time prior to the\nconclusion of the search. The form also said that if the visitors refused to consent to the search, their visiting\nprivileges would be immediately and indefinitely terminated. Neither Baker nor the consent form made clear that\nthe search to which the visitors were being asked to consent was a strip search. After Baker finished reading,\neach of Wood's visitors (except the baby) signed a consent form.\nKatrina Thamert and her baby were then taken by two female officers to a private bathroom, and Phillip was\ntaken by two male officers to a private storage room, while Michelle Hatch waited in the main reception area.\nKatrina was asked to remove her baby's clothing and diaper. One of the two female officers visually inspected the\nbaby and checked the baby's clothes and diaper for contraband. Katrina held her baby at all times, and neither\nofficer touched the baby during the search. Katrina was then told to put the baby's clothes back on. Although\nthere were no drugs found on the baby or her clothing, the searches continued.\nIn the storage room, Phillip was told by the two male officers to take off his clothing, and he did so. One of the\nmale officers searched through his clothing and visually inspected his mouth and ears. He was asked to lift his\n\narms and his genitals. Neither officer touched Phillip at any time. He was then permitted to dress and was taken\nback to the reception area.\nPhillip held Katrina's baby in the reception area while Katrina was searched in the bathroom by the two female\nofficers. After removing her clothing, she was asked to lift her breasts, and then was told to squat and cough. One\nof the officers manually searched her clothing and visually inspected her mouth and ears. Neither of the officers\ntouched Katrina during the search. She was permitted to dress and return to the reception area. The female\nofficers then escorted Michelle Hatch into the bathroom and went through the same procedure as they had with\nKatrina.\n927 *927 None of the searches having turned up contraband, the visitors were permitted to see Sharon Wood.\nKatrina, Phillip, and Michelle told Wood about the strip searches. Following the visit, Wood filed an internal\ngrievance with the MCC. After an internal investigation, Superintendent Clemons responded to Wood with a\nmemorandum asserting that the strip searches had not violated any prison regulation or policy. Shortly thereafter,\nthe Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections affirmed Clemons' decision. This lawsuit followed.\nII\nThe plaintiffs' amended complaint sought damages, an injunction, and declaratory relief for a variety of alleged\nconstitutional violations and common law torts arising out of the strip searches. The district court, on cross-\nmotions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment, granted the defendants' motion for summary\njudgment in its entirety and denied the plaintiffs' motions for class certification and to file a second amended\ncomplaint.\nThe plaintiffs appeal solely from the district court's entry of judgment in favor of defendant Clemons as to their\nclaim for damages under ยง 1983 based on his alleged violations of the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights. The\nonly question in this appeal is whether the district court correctly concluded that Clemons is entitled to qualified\nimmunity from the plaintiffs' damages claim under ยง 1983. The plaintiffs argue that Clemons is not entitled to\nqualified immunity here, because any reasonable official in Clemons' position would have known that the Fourth\nAmendment does not permit officials to undertake a strip search based on an uncorroborated tip received from a\nsingle anonymous source.\nWe review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. See St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20,\n24 (1st Cir.1995),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 2548, 135 L.Ed.2d 1068 (1996). The ultimate question of\nwhether a defendant is entitled, on a given set of facts, to the protection of qualified immunity is a question of law\nfor the court to decide. See id. at 24 n.1; Prokey v. Watkins, 942 F.2d 67, 73 (1st Cir.1991); Cortes-Quinones v.\nJimenez-Nettleship, 842 F.2d 556, 561 (1st Cir.),cert. denied,488 U.S. 823, 109 S.Ct. 68, 102 L.Ed.2d 45 (1988)\n.\nIII\nThe \"touchstone\" of the qualified immunity question is the concept of \"objective legal reasonableness.\" See \nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). Could an objectively\nreasonable official, situated similarly to the defendant, have believed that his conduct did not violate the plaintiffs'\nconstitutional rights, in light of clearly established law and the information possessed by the defendant at the time\nof the allegedly wrongful conduct? See Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1373 (1st Cir.),cert. denied,\n___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 675, 133 L.Ed.2d 524 (1995); Singer v. Maine, 49 F.3d 837, 844 (1st Cir.1995). Here, the\nplaintiffs contend that Clemons' conduct 00 authorizing the strip searches 00 violated their clearly established rights\n97 97\nunder the Fourth Amendment and fell below the operative threshold of objective legal reasonableness.\nClemons disputes the plaintiffs' position both as to the level of suspicion required to justify strip searches of\n[3]\nprison visitors, and as to when the legal rule embracing that level of suspicion became \"clearly established.\"\nOn the first issue, we agree with the plaintiffs that a prison-visitor strip search must be predicated upon\n\"reasonable suspicion.\" Finding no need to resolve the second question, however, we conclude that the\n\n928 defendant is entitled to qualified immunity on *928 the record here, accepting arguendo the plaintiffs' contention\nas to when the relevant law became clearly established.\nA\nWe begin by examining the nature of the Fourth Amendment protections to which the plaintiffs were entitled as\nvisitors to the MCC. Although a generous amount of deference is given to prison officials on matters of prison\nsafety, security, and discipline, see, e.g., Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547-48, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1878-79, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979), it is clear that visitors do not relinquish their Fourth Amendment rights at the prison gates. \nSee Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 563 (1st Cir.1985). Prison visitors retain the right to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures. Cochrane v. Quattrocchi, 949 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1991),cert. denied,504\nU.S. 985, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992). The meaning of \"reasonableness\" for Fourth Amendment\npurposes is highly situational. A search that is reasonable in the prison environment may not be in other contexts\nless \"fraught with serious security dangers.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. The standard of\n\"reasonableness\" that governs searches in a given context depends, in general, upon a balancing of \"the need to\nsearch against the invasion which the search entails.\" Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 536-37, 87 S.Ct.\n1727, 1735, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967); see also Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 564.\nIn the volatile context of a prison, the need to preserve internal security is very strong. See Blackburn, 771 F.2d at\n562 (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3200, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984)). Prison officials\nmay well have a need to search visitors in some manner in order to prevent the smuggling of contraband (such\nas drugs or weapons) to inmates. On the other side of the balance, people naturally have a \"diminished\nexpectation of privacy\" when they enter a prison, Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 564, and so \"those visiting a prison\ncannot credibly claim to carry with them the full panoply of rights they normally enjoy,\" id. at 563; see also Spear\nv. Sowders, 71 F.3d 626, 630 (6th Cir.1995) (discussing constitutionality of routine visitor searches).\nHowever, a strip search can hardly be characterized as a routine procedure or as a minimally intrusive means of\nmaintaining prison security. Indeed, \"`a strip search, by its very nature, constitutes an extreme intrusion upon\npersonal privacy, as well as an offense to the dignity of the individual.'\" Cochrane, 949 F.2d at 13 (quoting Burns\nv. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 235 n.6 (1st Cir. 1990)). Accordingly, a strip search cannot be justified absent some\nquantum of individualized suspicion. See Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 564-65 (invalidating as unconstitutional a prison\npolicy requiring strip searches of all visitors without any particularized suspicion of illegal activity).\nIn determining the level of individualized suspicion against which to test the constitutionality of prison-visitor strip\nsearches with a view to striking the proper balance between respecting the legitimate privacy expectations of\nprison visitors and the need to maintain prison security, courts have converged upon one common benchmark:\nthe standard of \"reasonable suspicion.\" See Spear, 71 F.3d at 630; Romo v. Champion, 46 F.3d 1013, 1020 (10th\nCir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 387, 133 L.Ed.2d 309 (1995); Daugherty v. Campbell, 935 F.2d 780,\n787 (6th Cir.1991) (Daugherty I), cert. denied,502 U.S. 1060, 112 S.Ct. 939, 117 L.Ed.2d 110 (1992); Thorne v.\nJones, 765 F.2d 1270, 1277 (5th Cir.1985),cert. denied,475 U.S. 1016, 106 S.Ct. 1198, 1199, 89 L.Ed.2d 313\n(1986); Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 674 (8th Cir.1982); accord Varrone v. Bilotti, 867 F.Supp. 1145, 1149\n(E.D.N.Y. 1994). This court has similarly identified the reasonable suspicion standard, albeit in another context,\nas the one by which the constitutionality of a strip search should be determined. See United States v.\nUricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir.1991) (stating, in context of border searches, that \"[w]here a\nsearch is not routine (e.g., a strip search), we have applied the `reasonable suspicion' standard.\") (citing United\nStates v. Wardlaw, 576 F.2d 932, 934-35 (1st Cir. 1978)).\n929 *929 Without deciding the question whether or when the reasonable suspicion standard became clearly\n[4]\nestablished in the prison visitor context in this circuit,  we now explicitly state that \"reasonable suspicion\" is\nindeed the proper standard by which to gauge the constitutionality of prison-visitor strip searches. That standard\nguards against arbitrary or clearly unfounded searches by placing non-trivial constraints upon the ability of prison\nofficials to strip search visitors, see Daugherty v. Campbell, 33 F.3d 554, 556-57 (6th Cir.1994) (Daugherty II)\n(holding that uncorroborated tips without indicia of reliability do not create reasonable suspicion), but avoids\nunduly restricting prison officials in responding to the demands of institutional security. The reasonable suspicion\n\nstandard thus preserves an appropriate balance between visitors' legitimate privacy interests and the\ngovernment's need to search. In sum, prison officials violate the Fourth Amendment when they undertake a strip\nsearch of a prison visitor without reasonable suspicion of circumstances that justify the search. The concrete\nmeaning of reasonable suspicion turns on the facts of each particular case.\nB\nPlaintiffs can overcome the defendant's assertion of the qualified immunity defense only by showing that\nClemons' conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law. Assuming, without deciding, for\npurposes of our analysis here, that the reasonable suspicion standard was clearly established law by the date on\nwhich the plaintiffs were strip searched, we conclude that Clemons is entitled to qualified immunity. A reasonable\nofficial in his position could have believed that there was reasonable suspicion that the plaintiffs would be\n[5]\nbringing drugs to Sharon Wood.\nA \"reasonable suspicion\" of wrongdoing is something stronger than a mere \"hunch,\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 22,\n88 S.Ct. 1868, 1880-81, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), but something weaker than probable cause. See Alabama v.\nWhite, 496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990); Spear, 71 F.3d at 630. At a minimum,\nthe reasonable suspicion standard requires that the decision to search be based on articulable factual information\nbearing at least some indicia of reliability. See, e.g., White, 496 U.S. at 330, 110 S.Ct. at 2416; United States v.\nSokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). However, \"reasonable suspicion can arise\nfrom information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause.\" White, 496 U.S. at 330, 110\nS.Ct. at 2416. Although an anonymous tip, standing alone, may typically fail to create reasonable suspicion, an\nanonymous tip that is corroborated in some measure by actual facts or by other sources may be enough. See id.\nat 329-31, 110 S.Ct. at 2415-17; United States v. Walker, 7 F.3d 26, 31 (2d Cir.1993),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___,\n114 S.Ct. 1201, 127 L.Ed.2d 549 (1994); United States v. McBride, 801 F.2d 1045, 1047-48 (8th Cir.1986),cert.\ndenied,479 U.S. 1100, 107 S.Ct. 1325, 94 L.Ed.2d 177 (1987).\nHere, plaintiffs argue that the hearsay tip received by Detective Herring from his confidential informant, who had\nheard it from an anonymous source, did not provide reasonable suspicion, and that no reasonable official could\nhave thought differently. The difficulty with this argument is that it seeks to defeat Clemons' claim of immunity by\ncharging him with notice of facts that were not actually known to him at the time he made the decision to\nauthorize the searches.\nThe issue on appeal is whether Clemons, and not any other defendant or potential defendant, is entitled to\n930 qualified immunity. The inquiry must focus on whether *930 Clemons himself acted as a reasonable official might.\nThat determination can only be made \"in light of ... the information [that Clemons] possessed at the time of his\nallegedly unlawful conduct.\" McBride v. Taylor, 924 F.2d 386, 389 (1st Cir.1991); see also Anderson, 483 U.S. at\n641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039-40; Prokey, 942 F.2d at 72. Here, there is no dispute that Clemons was told by his staff\nand genuinely believed that Detective Herring had learned from two unconnected confidential informants that\nSharon Wood's visitors were smuggling drugs into the MCC in her granddaughter's booties.\nThe plaintiffs respond by arguing that Clemons acted unreasonably in accepting Baker's report as true without\nconducting further investigation. We disagree. While the mistake that led to Clemons being misinformed as to the\nnature of the tip is not to be condoned, we cannot say, on the totality of the circumstances of this case, that\nClemons was unjustified in accepting Officer Baker's report at face value. Over the course of their five-year\nworking relationship, Clemons had grown to trust Baker to provide him with reliable information on investigatory\nmatters. Indeed, Clemons testified at his deposition that Baker had always provided him with accurate\ninformation and, in Clemons' estimation, was \"not one to make assumptions.\" Similarly, in Clemons' experience,\ninformation provided by Peter Herring to the MCC in a large number of previous investigations had always turned\nout to be accurate, and Clemons had thus come to consider Herring himself to be a reliable and trustworthy\nsource of information. The plaintiffs do not allege that Clemons' general trust in Baker or in Herring was\nunjustified or misplaced.\n\nIt is only fair to conclude that Clemons had a reasonable basis to believe that the tip about Wood's visitors 00 as\n97\nreported in Baker's memorandum 00 had already been tested for reliability by both Herring and Baker, and that\n97\nthere was no need for Clemons himself to conduct further investigation into the tip's sources. And, if Clemons\nreasonably believed that the tip, as reported, was reliable, it would be inconsistent with the basic purpose of the\nqualified immunity defense 00 i.e., to protect an official's reasonable judgments from post hoc attack 00 to deprive\n97 97\nClemons of that defense merely because the nature of the tip was, through no fault of his own, erroneously\n[6]\nreported to him. See United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 232-33, 105 S.Ct. 675, 682-83, 83 L.Ed.2d 604\n(1985) (explaining that police officers who make an investigatory stop based on defensible reliance upon an\nerroneous police bulletin may assert immunity in civil suit for Fourth Amendment violations); cf. United States v.\nDe Leon-Reyna, 930 F.2d 396, 399-400 (5th Cir.1991) (en banc) (border officer's reliance on erroneous\ninformation provided by dispatcher may be objectively reasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes, even if error\nwas partly result of officer's own negligence).\nOnce we accept that Clemons defensibly relied upon the contents of Baker's report in making the decision to\nauthorize the strip searches, this case can no longer be viewed (as plaintiffs would characterize it) as one in\nwhich an official knowingly relied on an uncorroborated, anonymous tip in carrying out a search. Cf. Daugherty II,\n33 F.3d at 557 (rejecting qualified immunity defense where official authorized strip search of prison visitor based\non letters from \"an anonymous inmate and ... a non-existent person\" and an uncorroborated assertion of a\n931 corrections officer).[7] Instead, Clemons' authorization of *931 the searches was based on a tip he believed had\nbeen received from two unconnected yet mutually corroborating confidential informants, both of whom Clemons\nbelieved had made the highly specific allegation that visitors were hiding drugs in an infant's booties for an\ninmate who was serving time for a drug conviction. Nor can we ignore that Clemons' assessment of the tip's\nreliability was favorably affected by his awareness that it had been delivered to the MCC by Peter Herring, who,\nto the best of Clemons' knowledge, had never before provided prison officials with information that had turned out\nto be false.\nViewed in this light, it is difficult to say that Clemons' decision to authorize the searches was \"objectively legally\nunreasonable.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039. Mindful that \"`if there is a legitimate question as to\nwhether an official's conduct constitutes a constitutional violation, the official is entitled to qualified immunity,'\" \nSinger, 49 F.3d at 845 (quoting Wiley v. Doory, 14 F.3d 993, 995 (4th Cir.1994)) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), we conclude that Clemons is entitled to the protection of that defense. An objectively reasonable official,\npresented with all of the information in Clemons' possession and similarly situated, could very well have believed\nthat there existed a basis for reasonable suspicion that Wood's visitors would be smuggling drugs into the MCC.\n[8]\nCf. United States v. Wangler, 987 F.2d 228, 230 (5th Cir.1993) (information provided by \"two unconnected\n[9]\ninformants\" contributed to reasonable suspicion that suspect was carrying drugs).\nIV\nWe conclude that defendant Clemons is entitled to qualified immunity from personal liability for his alleged\nviolation of the plaintiffs' constitutional right, as prison visitors, not to be strip searched except upon reasonable\nsuspicion that they were carrying contraband. Clemons, in defensible reliance on written information provided to\nhim by a trusted prison official, believed in good faith that a police detective with a proven track record of feeding\ninvariably accurate investigative information to the prison had learned that two unconnected confidential\ninformants had separately reported the same highly specific allegation that the visitors of a named female inmate\nwere smuggling drugs into the prison in her infant granddaughter's booties. On the record before us, an\nobjectively reasonable official in possession of this information and otherwise similarly situated to Clemons could\nhave decided there was reasonable suspicion to believe that Sharon Wood's visitors would be smuggling drugs\ninto the MCC. The district court therefore properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Clemons.\nAffirmed. No costs.\n\n[1] The named plaintiffs in this action are Sharon Wood; her son Phillip Thamert; her daughter Katrina Thamert,\non her own behalf and as parent of Maria Thamert; and John and Mary Foss, as parents and next friends of\nMichelle Hatch, Phillip Thamert's girlfriend. They purport to assert their claims on behalf of a statewide class of\nindividuals affected by the alleged strip-search policies of the Maine Correctional Center (\"MCC\"). The\ndefendants are James R. Clemons, Superintendent of the MCC, and Donald L. Allen, Commissioner of the Maine\nDepartment of Corrections.\n[2] The record does not clearly indicate whether Herring ever knew the identity of the original tipster.\n[3] Clemons, appropriately, makes no serious argument that the plaintiffs' signing of the \"consent to search\" forms\non the day of the visit constitutionally justified the searches. See Cochrane v. Quattrocchi, 949 F.2d 11, 14 (1st\nCir. 1991) (\"[A] prison visitor confronted with the choice between submitting to a strip search or foregoing [sic] a\nvisit cannot provide a `legally cognizable consent,'\" because \"it is the very choice to which [the visitor] [is] put that\nis constitutionally intolerable.\") (quoting Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 568, 569 (1st Cir.1985)), cert. denied,\n504 U.S. 985, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992).\n[4] Clemons contends that the reasonable suspicion standard was not clearly established in this circuit as of\nFebruary 1994. He observes that this court, in its most recent published opinion addressing the issue before that\ntime, had reserved the question, saying only that visitor strip searches require \"some as-yet undefined `level of\nindividualized suspicion.'\" Cochrane, 949 F.2d at 13 (quoting Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 567). Plaintiffs contend that\ndespite the statement in Cochrane, decisions in other circuits had made clear by February 1994 that \"reasonable\nsuspicion\" was indeed the governing standard.\n[5] Plaintiffs do not argue that the Fourth Amendment required the strip searches to be predicated on any basis\nstronger than reasonable suspicion.\n[6] There is no suggestion here that prison officials deliberately or systematically misreported information to\nClemons in order to obtain authorizations for strip searches. Cf. Arizona v. Evans, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 115 S.Ct.\n1185, 1194, 131 L.Ed.2d 34 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (observing that even though the good faith\nexception to the exclusionary rule applied where a police officer reasonably relied on an erroneous computer\nrecord in making a false arrest, the same might not be true where the computer records relied upon were known\nto be systematically inaccurate).\n[7] In Daugherty II, the defendant warden conceded that the letters did not form a basis for reasonable suspicion\nbut contended that he was entitled to rely on the statements of the corrections officer. See id. at 557. However,\nthere was no indication in that case that the warden had any reason to be unaware of the information's\nunreliability or to believe that the officer's statements (unlike Detective Herring's statements here) were\nindependently trustworthy. In any event, in rejecting the warden's argument, the Sixth Circuit stated, \"we do not\nimpose a duty on wardens to investigate the reliability of all their officers' conclusions.\" Id.\n[8] Plaintiffs do not raise, and we therefore deem waived, any argument that the tip's focus on the baby's booties\nprecluded the existence of individualized suspicion as to Katrina Thamert, Phillip Thamert, or Michelle Hatch.\n[9] Of course, to say such a belief would have been reasonable is not to imply that it would have been legally\ncorrect. Lowinger v. Broderick, 50 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[E]ven erroneous decisions by officials may be\nentitled to qualified immunity.\"); Rivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d 259, 263 (1st Cir.1992) (\"`The qualified immunity\nstandard gives ample room for mistaken judgments by protecting all but the plainly incompetent or those who\nknowingly violate the law.'\" (quoting Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 229, 112 S.Ct. 534, 537, 116 L.Ed.2d 589\n(1991) (per curiam)) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Although we sustain the defendant's\nassertion of the qualified immunity defense, we express no opinion as to the legal \"correctness\" of any belief that\nClemons may have had (based on the facts as he knew them) concerning the existence of reasonable suspicion\nthat the plaintiffs were engaged in illegal activity.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
