    "summary": "<p>On May 11, 1998, seven people who were formerly employed by the Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities (IBR), represented by private counsel, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The case was initially assigned to Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. and Magistrate Cheryl L. Pollak. The plaintiffs sued IBR, the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene, the New York Department of Civil Service, the Public Employees Federation, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and various individual defendants. Invoking 42 USC &sect; 1983, plaintiffs alleged violations of their property rights as guaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, as well as violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Labor Management Relation Act (LRMA) &sect; 301, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and state law. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that they were falsely advised that their positions were being eliminated due to a reduction in force, that defendants eliminated the jobs of more senior personnel to preserve the jobs of friends and family, and that defendants refused to pay grievances despite contractual and civil obligations. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, damages, and injunctive relief to reinstate their seniority positions and right to obtain early retirement benefits.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs amended their complaint on May 27, 1998 against the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities and individual defendants. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 15, 1998. Based upon a stipulation by both parties, on October 20, 1998, the court ordered dismissal without prejudice of the Public Employees Federation, AFL-CIO, and specified individuals. On June 24, 1999, the court dismissed the amended complaint for reasons stated on the record.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 24, 1999, by particularizing the claims and naming all management personnel who were in charge of administering the reduction in force. On February 2, 2000, the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint, which, on October 27, 2000, the court granted for the Public Employees Federation, AFL-CIO, and some individuals. The court dismissed the Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, New York State Department of Civil Service, and other individuals on January 25, 2001, followed by the dismissal of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene and remaining defendants on April 4, 2001. The defendants were dismissed because they were deceased, never served, or could not be subject to suit due to being statutory constructs.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought an appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on April 9, 2001. On June 12, 2001, the circuit court dismissed the appeal for failing to comply with the court's scheduling order.</p>\r\n<p>On April 11, 2002, the plaintiffs moved to vacate the district court's order granting the motion to dismiss under Rule 60(b). The plaintiffs asserted evidence in the form of an affidavit, and alleged that this constituted material, newly discovered evidence that by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to furnish grounds to change the court's decisions and orders. Plaintiffs also alleged they were prevented from prevailing because the defendants perpetrated fraud on the court, and that the affidavit showed that the defendants lied when they told the EEOC that the plaintiffs were laid off because they were the least senior in the positions where their jobs were eliminated. On March 3, 2003, the court denied the motion to vacate. The court held that the plaintiffs failed to illustrate why they could not have discovered the affidavit through due diligence, and that they made no argument on how the evidence would have probably changed the outcome had it been available. Additionally, the court pointed out that the plaintiffs' fraud allegations were already mentioned in the second amended complaint, and had been acknowledged as irrelevant when the court decided to dismiss the complaint, as it did not meet the threshold of fraud against the court.</p>\r\n<p>On April 1, 2003, the plaintiffs attempted to appeal the decision to the Second Circuit, claiming abuse of the district court's discretion. On March 30, 2004, the appellate court affirmed the district court's decision and found that it had not abused its discretion, because the plaintiffs were merely attempting to relitigate issues that had previously been resolved.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

After the plaintiffs amended their complaint, the court dismissed the complaint. The plaintiffs amended complaint once more, which also resulted in the court dismissing the amended complaint. The plaintiffs then attempted to appeal the decision unsuccessfully. The plaintiffs sought vacation of the order to dismiss, which was also denied. The plaintiffs then sought appeal of the order denying to vacate the order, but the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court. The case is now closed.",
