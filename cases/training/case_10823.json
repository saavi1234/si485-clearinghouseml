The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for injunctive, declaratory, and compensatory relief, claiming that they were wrongfully discharged.  Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that they were treated less favorably than younger employees as a result of a company-wide strategy to reduce costs and its older workforce.</p><p>On November 26, 1997, the District Court (Judge Lewis Babcock) granted Plaintiffs' motion to certify an ADEA collective action but denied the motion to certify an ERISA class action.  The Court found that conditional certification of an ADEA action was appropriate because Plaintiffs had shown that members of the proposed class were negatively impacted by Defendant's \"Strategic Plan.\"  However, the Court declined to certify an ERISA class action because Plaintiffs' proposed class definition was over-inclusive.  Vaszlavik v. Storage Tek Corp., 175 F.R.D. 672 (D. Col. 1997).</p><p>The Court granted Plaintiffs' second motion to certify an ERISA class action on November 9, 1998.  The Court found that Plaintiffs' revised class definition was adequate to define the class.  The ERISA class was defined as: \"all employees who were over the age of 40 at the time of their layoffs by employer, between April 13, 1993, and Dec. 31, 1996, because of their perceived above-average use or perceived anticipated above-average use of company benefits.\"  Vaszlavik v. Storage Tek Corp., 183 F.R.D. 264 (D. Col. 1998).</p><p>On March 9, 2000, the Court approved the parties' settlement and dismissed the case.  The settlement provided $5 million to members of the ADEA class and injunctive and declaratory relief to members of the ERISA class.  Vaszlavik v. Storage Tek Corp., 2000 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 21129 (D. Col. Mar. 9, 2000).

McNamara, P.C., has asked this Court to compensate them for their role in obtaining a settlement of \nclass claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\") and the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act (\"ERISA\"). The settlement provides a $5 million monetary recovery for the 417 \nmember ADEA collective action, as well as significant affirmative relief for the approximately 1,226-\nmember ERISA class. \nSpecifically, class counsel has asked this Court to award them a fee of 30% of the monetary settlement \nobtained or $1.5 million. Class counsel has also asks this Court to award it $309,252.41 for outstanding \ncosts. \nIn a court approved notice regarding the terms of the ADEA settlement, collective action members were \nadvised of class counsel’s request and were given an opportunity to object. No objections were received \nregarding class counsel’s request for fees and costs. \nOn March 8, 2000, this Court conducted a hearing regarding the Stipulation for Approval of Class \nSettlement, as well as class counsel’s fee Petition. Based upon my observation of counsel’s conduct \nduring this litigation, my knowledge of the difficult legal issues facing the Plaintiffs, and a review of class \ncounsel’s Petition for attorney’ Fees and Costs and Supplemental Information and Authority In Support of \nits Petition, I granted counsel’s request. This Order explains my findings and conclusion that counsel’s fee \nand cost request is reasonable and merited. \nII. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS \nA. Class Counsel’s Request For attorney’ Fees \n\nattorney’ fees are awarded to class counsel under the common benefit doctrine. (Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1, \n5 (1973).) When a settlement yields a fund for class members, fees must be paid from the recovery. \n(Boeing Co. v. VanGemert, 444 U.S. 472, 481 (1980)). \nCourts have applied one of two methods for determining attorney’ fee awards in common fund cases: (1) \nby a \"percentage of the fund\"; or (2) by the \"lodestar plus multiplier\" or \"enhanced lodestar\", which \nmultiplies the reasonable hours expended by a reasonable hourly rate, and finally by an additional \npercentage to compensate for risk. (Uselton v. Commercial Loveless Motor Freight, Inc., 9 F.3d 849, 853 \n(10th Cir. 1993); Rosenbaum v. MacAllister, 64 F.3d 1439, 1445 (10th Cir. 1995).) While enhanced \nlodestar cases remain instructive, the Tenth Circuit has expressed \"a preference for the percentage of the \nfund method\" in common fund cases. (Rosenbaum, 64 F.3d at 1445, quoting Gottlieb v. Barry, 43 F.3d \n474, 483 (10th Cir. 1994).) \nFees for class action settlements generally range from 20%-50%. (Maywalt v. Parker and Parsley \nPetroleum Co., 963 F.Supp. 310 (S.D. N.Y. 1997); Naturalizer Production Liability Litigation, 1996 W.L. \n780512, p. * 14 (E.D. Mich. 1996); In re Combustion, Inc., 968 F.Supp. at 1132).) Regardless of whether \na percentage of the fund or enhanced lodestar approach is used, class action fee awards are typically \n30% of the fund created by the settlement. (In re Activision Securities Litigation, 723 F.Supp. 1373, 1375-\n78 (N.D. Cal. 1989) (30% should be awarded \"absent exceptional circumstances\").) \nThe Tenth Circuit has concluded that whichever method for fee calculation is employed, the District Court \nmust consider the 12 factors articulated in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-\n19 (5th Cir. 1974). (Gottlieb, 43 F.3d at 483; Rosenbaum, 64 F.3d at 1445). The Johnson factors include: \n(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the question presented by the case; (3) the \nskill requisite to perform the legal services properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the \nattorney due to the acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or \ncontingent; (7) any time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved \nand the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorney; (10) the undesirability \nof the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in \nsimilar cases. (Id.) \nApplying the Johnson factors to this case, I find that an award of 30% of the common fund is reasonable \nand warranted. \n1. Time And Labor Required \nThis litigation required class counsel to commit vast amounts of time and labor in order to obtain a \nfavorable settlement. A Complaint on behalf of three named Plaintiffs alleging class-wide discrimination \nwas filed on October 2, 1995. In the more than four years this case was litigated, Plaintiffs’ counsel \ninvested, at least, 6,043.90 hours, incurring attorney’ fees of $977,517.75. I find that this fee was \nreasonable. In fact, based on my knowledge of fees charged in complex litigation nationally, I find that the \nhourly rates charged by class counsel were on the low side, even in the District of Colorado. \nCounsel’s considerable investment of time and labor was reasonable and necessary in such a complex \ncase. Plaintiffs’ claims arose out of the layoff of more than 2,000 employees, and involved two certified \nclasses. Both parties aggressively litigated the case. Plaintiffs produced 28,693 pages of documents, \nwhile Defendant produced 150,158 pages of documents. Plaintiffs’ counsel took 91 depositions and \ndefended 74 depositions taken by Defendant. There are 239 pleadings in Plaintiffs’ files, including 66 \nmotions filed by Plaintiffs and 48 filed by Defendant. Plaintiffs’ counsel interviewed approximately 250 \nwitnesses and secured affidavit testimony from 63 of those witnesses. The parties designated a total of \nnine expert witnesses. At the time of settlement, discovery had been completed, a Pretrial Order entered, \ntrial exhibits exchanged, and with the exception of dispositive motion rulings, the parties were ready for \ntrial. \n\nA 30% fee, or $1.5 million, is highly appropriate given the time and labor expended. A 30% award only \nconstitutes a 1.53 multiplier of the lodestar. Courts in common fund cases regularly award multipliers of \ntwo to three times the lodestar or more to compensate for risk and to reflect the quality of the work \nperformed. (Ressler v. Jacobson, 149 F.R.D. 651, 653 fn. 4 (M.D. Fla. 1992) (compiling cases); In re \nCombustion, Inc., 968 F.Supp. at 1133-34) (compiling cases); Mister, et al. v. Illinois Central Gulf R.R., \nNo. 81-3006 (S.D. Ill. August 5, 1993), (compiling cases).) \n2. Novelty And Difficulty Of The Question Presented By The Case \nAs discussed in my Order Approving Class Settlement and Dismissing Class Claims With Prejudice, there \nwere numerous difficult, complex, and uncertain legal and factual issues presented in this case. The law \nregarding pattern and practice ADEA and ERISA cases is particularly uncertain. In this case, there were \nnumerous unresolved legal issues regarding the validity of Plaintiffs’ statistical proof, the weight to be \ngiven the anecdotal evidence, and the propriety of maintaining class certification status. I find that the \nnovelty and difficulty of the legal and factual issues presented by this case weighs heavily in favor of the \nfees requested. \n3. The Skill Requisite To Perform The Legal Services Properly \nAs discussed, this case involved numerous extremely complex and difficult legal and factual issues, many \nof which have not been fully resolved by the Courts. Litigating such complex issues required a high \ndegree of specialized skill in employment law and complex litigation. \n4. The Preclusion Of Other Employment By The attorney Due To Acceptance Of The Case \nClass litigation of this magnitude inherently entails significant opportunity costs. In this case, the \nopportunity costs were particularly significant, given that Plaintiffs’ counsel was comprised of a small \nthree-attorney law firm with the assistance of one other attorney and limited associate support. Class \ncounsel’s obligation to zealously pursue this enormous case no doubt cost them significant opportunities \nto earn other compensation through the litigation of less burdensome cases. The opportunity costs \nincurred by class counsel also weigh heavily in favor of the requested fee. \n5. The Customary Fee \nBased on my experience with common fund fee awards, I conclude that a 30% contingent fee is well \nwithin the normal range of fee awards. \n6. Whether The Fee Is Fixed Or Contingent \nClass counsel pursued this case on a contingent fee, whereby they would receive no compensation for \ntheir labor if they did not obtain a successful outcome, either through settlement or judgment. Given the \nrisk of non-recovery, this factor weighs heavily in favor of the requested fee. \n7. Time Limitations Imposed By The Client Or The Circumstances \nI find that the size and magnitude of this case clearly imposed significant time limitations on the small civil \nrights law firm representing the class. The time limitations were particularly significant given the prospect \nfor a two-month liability trial, subsequent appeals, and remedial proceedings for individual damages. \n8. The Amount Involved And The Results Obtained \nThrough the efforts of class counsel, two classes were certified by this Court, one of which will divide a \nsettlement of $5 million and a second which will benefit from the implementation of significant affirmative \n\nrelief. Given the considerable risk that the Plaintiffs would recover nothing for their efforts, this result \nsupports the requested fee. \n9. The Experience, Reputation, And Ability Of The attorney \nBased on my observation of their prosecution of this case, I find that Benezra & Culver, L.L.C. pursued \nthis litigation in a tenacious and articulate manner. Their experience, reputation, and ability is exceptional. \n10. The Undesirability Of The Case \nI find that this was an undesirable case for counsel to undertake given the risk of no recovery and the \nuncertainty of the governing law. \n11. The Nature And Length Of The Professional Relationship With The Client \nClass counsel’s only relationship with the class was in the context of this litigation. \n12. Awards In Similar Cases \nI find that the requested fee of 30% of the settlement is well within the ordinary range of common fund fee \nawards. A 30% common fund fee award is in the middle of the ordinary 20%-50% range and is \npresumptively reasonable. \nB. The Requested Costs \nAs with attorney’ fees, an attorney who creates or preserves a common fund for the benefit of a class is \nentitled to receive reimbursement of all reasonable costs incurred. (See e.g. Blum, 465 U.S. at 573). \nCosts are awarded in addition to the attorney fee percentage. (In re Business Land Security Litigation, \n(1991) Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) § 96, 059 (N.D. Cal. June 14, 1991) (cases collected).) \nGiven my experience with actions of this magnitude and the inherent expense of pattern and practice \nemployment discrimination actions, particularly with respect to the essential statistical expert analysis, I \nconclude that class counsel’s request that it be reimbursed for $309,252.41 in outstanding costs is fair \nand reasonable. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nAfter consideration of counsel’s Petition, I conclude that the requested attorney’ fees and cost \nreimbursements are fair and merited. Accordingly, it is  \nORDERED that the requested 30% attorney’ fee, or $1.5 million is APPROVED. It is \nFURTHER ORDERED that the requested reimbursement of $309,252.41 in outstanding costs is \nAPPROVED \n \nBY THE COURT: \n  \n\n  \n \n  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n ",
