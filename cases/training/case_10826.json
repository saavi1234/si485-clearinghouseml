    "summary": "<p>This case concerns the legality of a California test to certify public school teachers. On September 23, 1992, two teachers&rsquo; associations and fifteen individual teachers and administrators brought this putative class action lawsuit against the State of California and the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (&ldquo;CTC&rdquo;) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs challenged the defendants&rsquo; use of the California Basic Educational Skills Test (&ldquo;CBEST&rdquo;), a requirement to become a public school teacher or administrator in California. Represented by Public Advocates, the plaintiffs alleged that the CBEST violated Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating on the basis of race to determine employment for a federally funded program. Specifically, the plaintiffs contended that the CBEST had a disparate impact on people of color&mdash;Black, Latino, and Asian applicants failed the CBEST at significantly higher rates than white applicants. The plaintiffs also contended that the CBEST did not sufficiently relate to relevant job skills, and thus less discriminatory means existed to certify public school employees. They sought class certification, injunctive relief, and attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1988.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 16, 1992, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to add the Oakland Alliance of Black Educators and four individual teachers as plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On April 1, 1993, the State of California and the CTC moved for partial summary judgment on the Title VI claims. The plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the applicability of Title VII and Title VI on April 1 and May 3, 1993, respectively. The defendants also moved for partial summary judgment on the applicability of the Title VII claims on May 3.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>District Judge William H. Orrick granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for partial summary judgment and denied the defendants&rsquo; motion on August 25, 1993. Judge Orrick found that Title VI and VII both applied to the plaintiffs&rsquo; allegations. 836 F. Supp. 1534. The court held that the text of 42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000d-7 allowed a state and other entities within the state public school system to be defendants in a Title VI action.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 13, 1993, the plaintiffs moved to certify a class of &ldquo;Latino, African American, and Asian California public school credential or job applicants past, present, and future who have been or will be denied credentials or certificated positions based on the California Basic Educational Skills Test.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved for partial summary judgment on May 14, 1994.</p>\r\n<p>On July 19, 1994, the court granted class certification and denied the defendants&rsquo; motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved to compel joinder of necessary parties on April 7, 1995, which the court denied on November 7. The defendants also moved for summary judgment on July 5, 1995. One day later, the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the CBEST&rsquo;s adverse impact and lack of validity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for partial summary judgment on August 9, 1995, finding that attorneys raised many genuine issues of material fact during oral argument. Judge Orrick also denied the defendants&rsquo; July 5 motion for summary judgment on August 25, 1995, holding that the doctrine of laches did not completely bar the plaintiffs&rsquo; action.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Orrick presided over a trial throughout June 1996, during which the CTC moved for judgment as a matter of law on June 17.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Orrick issued a judgment for the defendants on September 17, 1996, holding that the CBEST did not violate Title VI or Title VII. The court found that (1) that the plaintiffs had established a prima facie case by showing that the CBEST had a disparate impact on minorities; (2) that all three studies of the CBEST submitted to the court proved it to be a valid measure of job-related skills; (3) that the passing score reflected professionally reasonable judgments about minimum levels of basic knowledge, skills and abilities for teaching jobs; and (4) that the plaintiffs had failed to show the existence of an equally effective alternate screening device. 937 F. Supp. 1397.</p>\r\n<p>On October 16, 1996, the plaintiffs appealed the district court&rsquo;s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The plaintiffs argued that (1) the district court erred in concluding that the CBEST was properly validated, and (2) the court violated Federal Rule of Evidence 706 by relying on the advice of an expert who was not subject to cross-examination and did not prepare a report. On October 25, 1996, the defendants filed a cross-appeal regarding the district court&rsquo;s conclusions, on summary judgment, that Titles VI and VII applied. The defendants also appealed the district court&rsquo;s order denying costs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ninth Circuit Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld and District Judge Steven V. Judge Wilson found on July 12, 1999, that neither Title VI nor VII applied to CBEST in this case, and that the district court did not commit any reversible error in factual findings. 195 F.3d 465. Circuit Judge Robert Boochever dissented, contending that the majority&rsquo;s holding relied on the mistaken conclusion that Title VII did not apply to the CBEST simply because it was a licensing exam.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing en banc on August 2, 1999, which the Ninth Circuit granted on January 21, 2000.</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, 2000, the United States and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission submitted an amicus brief, arguing that the CBEST was subject to judicial review under Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 20, 2000, the Ninth Circuit reheard the appeal en banc. Circuit Judges Procter Hug, Jr., Mary M. Schroeder, Stephen Reinhardt, Diarmuid F. O&rsquo;Scannlain, Ferdinand F. Fernandez, Pamela Ann Rymer, Andrew J. Kleinfeld, A. Wallace Tashima, Sidney R. Thomas, Susan P. Graber, and Ronald M. Gould presided over the appeal. 231 F.3d. 572.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit affirmed both the judgment for the defendants and the order denying the defendants&rsquo; costs on October 30, 2000. Judge Graber held that (1) Title VII applied to the CBEST, (2) the CBEST was properly validated, (3) the district court permissibly used a technical advisor, and (4) the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to award costs to the defendants. Circuit Judges Reinhardt, Schroeder, Thomas, Fernandez, Rymer, Kleinfeld, O&rsquo;Scannlain, and Gould concurred in part and dissented in part. Circuit Judge Tashima dissented.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit issued a mandate on December 29, 2000. The case is now closed.</p>",

This case presents a challenge to a discriminatory selection device being used by the \nDefendants State of California and California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (\"CTC\") \nfor determining employment in the public schools.  Passage of the California Basic \nEducational Skills Test (\"CBEST\") has been an absolute requirement to obtain teaching, \ncounseling, and administrative credentials, as well as almost every other type of public school \ncredential issued by the State of California since February 1, 1983.  Cal. Educ. Code §§ \n44252(b); 44830.  (Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent code references are to the California \nEducation Code.)   \n  2.  Since the design and implementation of the test in 1982 and 1983 by the Defendant \nCTC pursuant to State statute, the CBEST has had a severe adverse impact on the access of \nLatinos, African Americans, and Asians to public school credential positions.  White \napplicants have passed the CBEST at a rate of 80%, while African Americans, Latinos, and \nAsians have passed at rates of only 35%, 51%, and 59%, respectively. \n  3.  The disparity present among CBEST passing rates over the last nine years \ncorresponds to the disparity of racial representation in California's public school teaching \nforce.  Though the student population of California's public schools is currently 55% non-\nwhite, and steadily increasing, the state's teaching force remains 82% white and only 16.5% \nLatino, African American and Asian.  Despite the huge influx of minorities into California's \ngeneral population and the working force over the last decade -- a period when whites declined \nfrom 67% to 57% of the general population -- the 82% white composition of the teaching force \nhas remained unchanged. \n \n \n \n  2 \n\n  4.  As Plaintiffs allege herein, the CBEST is not a licensing exam for the teaching \nprofession.  Its statutory application -- as well as the entire State credentialing process -- \nextends no further than the State's one common Public School System.  As such, the CBEST is \nan employment exam required and administered by the State exclusively for State \nemployment. \n  5.  Despite the passage of ten years of implementation and the exam's administration to \nover 350,000 individual test-takers, the CBEST has never been subjected to the well-\nestablished professional standards required of any public or private employer or federal fund \nrecipient utilizing such a high-stakes selection device with such a disproportionate racial \nimpact. \n  6.  The test purports to measure the college-level reading, writing, and math skills \nneeded by a minimally competent entry-level teacher, counselor, administrator, or other public \nschool credential holder.  Yet, the Defendants have never demonstrated that the CBEST \nactually measures those skills; nor have they shown that whatever is measured by the test is \nnecessary to perform the critical or important aspects of California's varied public school \ncredential positions; nor have they shown that the test in any way predicts competent job \nperformance. \n  7.  Moreover, the passing scores established by the State were not based on any rational, \njob-relevant criteria.  Instead, the State ignored the passing scores recommended by two \nseparate State-convened validation panels involving over 300 educators.  In order to placate \nperceived fears surrounding the quality of public education, the State set substantially higher \npassing rates than recommended based entirely on political considerations and contrary to the \nState's own data. \n \n \n \n  3 \n\n  8.  In responding to the well-intentioned but ill-informed mandate of the Legislature to \ncreate a single teacher accountability measure, Defendant CTC and its test contractor, the \nEducational Testing Service (\"ETS\") of Princeton, New Jersey, have had the impossible task of \ndevising a single standardized, multiple choice test that somehow captures the diverse job \ncontent of some 250,000 credential positions in California's public schools.  Unable to do so, \nthe Defendant CTC has settled on a test that purports to measure one's abstract mental \nfunctioning.  Not only have the Defendants failed to prove the CBEST capable of such a task, \nbut such attempts to create surrogate I.Q. tests violate a fundamental axiom of our nation's civil \nrights laws: that tests \"must measure the person for the job and not the person in the abstract. . . \n. \"  Griggs v. Duke Power Co, 401 U.S. 424, 436, 91 S.Ct. 849, 854, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971). \n  9.  Absurd results flow from absurd measures: proven administrators who have neither \nstudied nor needed geometry in thirty years are suddenly at risk of losing a job which requires \nno geometry because of the CBEST math section; much-needed bilingual math teachers are \nprevented from teaching because their written English lacks idiomatic flair; teachers of Spanish \nfor native-speakers are hired instead by private schools because they cannot answer as many \nreading questions in an hour as a native English test-taker. \n  10.  Because the CBEST has discriminated against the individual Plaintiffs, the Plaintiff \norganizations, their past, present, and future minority members, and other similarly situated \nminorities (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"Plaintiffs\" or \"Plaintiff class\") for nearly a \ndecade without being sufficiently job-related; because other more valid, less discriminatory \nmeans exist by which to ensure that teachers have competent skills; because the public \nschoolchildren of California have suffered too long from a severe underrepresentation of \nminority and bilingual teachers, Plaintiffs allege as follows:  \n \n \n \n  4 \n\n \n \n \n  JURISDICTION \n  11.  As all claims alleged herein arise under the laws of the United States providing for \nthe protection of civil rights, jurisdiction of the subject matter of this action is established in \nthis Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1343.  As to those specific claims arising under \nTitle VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as amended, this Court's jurisdiction is additionally \nestablished pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(3).   \n  12.  All requirements relating to the exhaustion of administrative remedies and the \ntimely filing of claims have been met by Plaintiffs.  Timely charges covering the Plaintiffs' \nallegations of discrimination by Defendants were filed with the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission.  The Attorney General of the United States has issued to Plaintiffs \nnotices of right to sue based on these charges and Plaintiffs have brought this action within \nninety days of notice thereof.  \n \n \n  PLAINTIFFS \n  a.  Association of Mexican-American Educators \n  13.  Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF MEXICAN-AMERICAN EDUCATORS (\"AMAE\") \nis a non-profit, tax-exempt corporation organized under the laws of and operating in the State \nof California for the purposes of advancing the education of Mexican American and Latino \nyouth, facilitating the recruitment and advancement of Mexican American and Latino \n \n \n \n  5 \n\neducators, and ensuring the provision of equal educational opportunities, benefits, and civil \nrights for all students, especially those of Mexican American and Latino descent.  AMAE's \ncurrent members include approximately 1700 Latino, African American, and Asian elementary \nand secondary school educators. \n  14.  The Defendants' practice of denying credentials to past, present, and potential \nLatino, African American, and Asian AMAE members based solely on their CBEST test \nresults has injured AMAE's members and potential members by denying them employment \nopportunities in the public schools and has injured AMAE by reducing its membership and \nfrustrating its ability to carry out the goals of the organization. \n \nb. California Association For Asian-Pacific Bilingual Education \n  15.  Plaintiff CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR ASIAN-PACIFIC BILINGUAL \nEDUCATION (\"CAFABE\") is a non-profit, tax-exempt corporation organized under the laws \nof and operating in the State of California in order to ensure educational equity and attainment \nof full potential for Asian-Pacific American language minority elementary and secondary \nstudents, to promote the learning of Asian-Pacific languages for all students, and to increase \nthe representation and influence of Asian-Pacific Americans at all levels of the educational \nsystem.  CAFABE's current members include approximately 300 Asian, Latino, and African \nAmerican, elementary and secondary school educators. \n  16.  The Defendants' practice of denying credentials to past, present, and potential \nAsian, Latino, and African American CAFABE members based solely on their CBEST test \nresults has injured CAFABE's members and potential members by denying them employment \nopportunities in the public schools and has injured CAFABE by reducing its membership and \n \n \n \n  6 \n\nfrustrating its ability to carry out the goals of the organization. \n \n  c. Oakland Alliance of Black Educators \n  17.  Plaintiff OAKLAND ALLIANCE OF BLACK EDUCATORS (\"OABE\"), an \naffiliate of the National Alliance of Black School Educators, is an unincorporated association \norganized and operating since 1975 in the State of California in order to eliminate and rectify \nthe effects of racism in education, to advance the education of African American \nschoolchildren, to promote and provide for the recruitment and professional advancement of \nAfrican American educators, to serve as a clearinghouse for articulating the needs of Oakland's \nAfrican American educators and schoolchildren to policymakers and the general public, and \ngenerally to serve as advocates for African American schoolchildren in the African American \ncommunity.  OABE's current members include approximately 120 African American \nelementary and secondary school educators. \n  18.  The Defendants' practice of denying credentials to past, present, and potential \nAfrican American, Latino, and Asian OABE members based solely on their CBEST test results \nhas injured OABE's members and potential members by denying them employment \nopportunities in the public schools and has injured OABE by reducing its membership and \nfrustrating its ability to carry out the goals of the organization. \n \n  d. Sara MacNeil Boyd \n  19.  Plaintiff SARA MACNEIL BOYD is an African American woman, residing in \nSanta Clara County in the State of California where she has taken the CBEST on numerous \noccasions.  She is seeking to maintain her current employment in the public schools of San \n \n \n \n  7 \n\nMateo County, California. \n  20.  BOYD is seeking an administrative services credential in order to maintain her \nposition as the Instructional Vice-Principal at Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, \nCalifornia. \n  21.  The essential minimum requirements for an administrative services credential \ninclude possession of a valid teaching credential; a minimum of three years service as a \nteacher; completion of an approved professional preparation program in administrative services \nat an institution of higher education; and passage of the CBEST.  §§ 44270; 44252(b). \n  22.  BOYD has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  23.  She has fully completed the course work and field work and all other requirements \nfor her administrative credential. \n  24.  The Defendants are denying BOYD her administrative credential and, thereby, the \nopportunity to obtain unconditional employment as an administrator in the public schools \nsolely as a result of her CBEST scores.   \n  25.  BOYD currently possesses valid California life credentials in Secondary Education \nand in Counseling/Pupil Personnel Services.  She has also held credentials for teaching in the \npublic schools of North Carolina and in the District of Columbia and, additionally, currently \nholds a Master's degree in Education.   \n  26.  Plaintiff SARA BOYD has 14 years of experience as a high school teacher in the \npublic schools of California, the District of Columbia, and North Carolina, 14 years of \nexperience as a Guidance Counselor in California's public schools, and another two years of \nexperience in the quasi-administrative role of Head Guidance Counselor, also in California's \npublic schools.   \n \n \n \n  8 \n\n  27.  In her positions in the public schools of North Carolina and the District of \nColumbia, BOYD performed at more than a minimally competent level, consistently receiving \nhigh praise and excellent evaluations. \n  28.  Similarly, in her teaching and counseling positions in California's public schools, \nBOYD has performed at more than a minimally competent level, consistently receiving high \npraise and excellent evaluations. \n  29.  Some of the numerous accolades BOYD has received in recognition of her \nexcellence as a teacher and a counselor include the 1973 American Field Service Outstanding \nTeacher/Counselor of the United States Award; the 1983 YWCA Palo Alto Outstanding Black \nWoman of the Year Award; the 1983 Sequoia Union High School District Employee of the \nYear Award; the 1984 Math, Engineering, Science Achievement California State Outstanding \nService Award; the 1988 KSOL San Mateo County Outstanding Service in Education Award, \nand, in 1990, being asked to sit on Defendant CTC's special advisory panel for the setting of \nstatewide counseling standards.   \n  30.  BOYD's superior skills as an educator and an administrator were recognized by the \nSequoia Union High School District when in 1989 she was appointed to the position of \nInstructional Vice-Principal at Menlo-Atherton High School.   \n  31.  The Menlo-Atherton High School population is made up of 60% Latino, African \nAmerican, and Asian students.   \n  32.  Plaintiff SARA BOYD is the first African American administrator responsible for \ninstruction at Menlo-Atherton High School and, as such, is especially suited to serve as an \nextra-sensitive conduit and role model for the school's large minority student population. \n   33.  That BOYD had already served this role well as Head Guidance Counselor is \n \n \n \n  9 \n\nevidenced by the State Department of Education's identifying Menlo-Atherton High School as \none of the top schools in the State in terms of placing its ethnic minority graduates in college \nprograms.  BOYD was in turn identified by Menlo-Atherton High School's administration as \nthe individual primarily responsible for this result.   \n  34.  BOYD has been able to serve as Instructional Vice-Principal for the past three years \ndespite not having passed the CBEST only by receiving special waivers from the State Board \nof Education in recognition of her superior qualifications as an administrator, of the school's \ngreat need for her skills, and of her competent performance in the position during the past three \nyears. \n  35.  The State Board of Education can waive the CBEST requirement pursuant to its \ngeneral authority to waive provisions of the Education Code upon special application by school \ndistricts.  § 33050 et seq.   \n  36.  The State Board of Education routinely grants short-term waivers for substitute \nteachers, but much less often grants waivers for individuals with special talents that a school \ndistrict specifically needs. \n  37.  The State Board's waivers are only temporary and do not provide a recipient with \nthe full rights and benefits of a credential. \n  38.  Moreover, the Board's waiver authority for the CBEST will expire on June 30, \n1994.  § 44225(m). \n  39.  Defendant CTC can waive any provision of the Teacher Credentialing chapter of \nthe Education Code under § 44225(m).   \n  40.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, however, that the CTC \nhas never used its authority pursuant to § 44225(m) to waive the CBEST requirement for the \n \n \n \n  10 \n\ngranting of any credential. \n  41.  Upon receiving her CBEST waivers, Plaintiff SARA BOYD has consistently \nperformed competently as an administrator, receiving high praise for her superior skills in the \njob, especially as regards her interactions with students, teachers, and staff; for her abilities to \nobtain outside grants for special programs; and for her efforts in designing and implementing \nspecial programs targeted at mainstreaming non-native English speaking students and students \nwith high potential but poor preparation in the basic skills. \n  42.  Despite neither having passed the CBEST, nor possessing a full administrative \ncredential, BOYD was nominated 1992 Administrator of the Year for the State of California by \nmembers of the Association of California School Administrators (ACSA) and ultimately \nreceived an ACSA Certificate of Recognition as the top administrator for 1992 in her region.   \n  43.  In May of 1992, the State Board of Education issued a further two-year waiver to \nallow BOYD to continue in her current administrative position but indicated to her that it \nwould be the last such waiver it would issue on her behalf.  At the expiration of this period, \nPlaintiff SARA BOYD will lose her position as an administrator and be demoted to the job of \ncounselor or teacher. \n \n  e.  Florence Flores \n  44.  Plaintiff FLORENCE FLORES is a Latino woman, residing in Los Angeles County \nin the State of California. \n  45.  FLORES is a member of the Association of Mexican-American Educators. \n  46.  FLORES is seeking an administrative credential in order to become the school site \nadministrator for a vocational skills center or an Adult Education school within the public \n \n \n \n  11 \n\nschool system.   \n  47.  FLORES has taken and failed the CBEST. \n  48.  She has fully completed the course work and field work and all other requirements \nfor her administrative credential. \n  49.  The Defendants are denying FLORES an administrative credential and, thereby, the \nopportunity to obtain employment as an administrator in the public schools solely as a result of \nher CBEST scores.   \n  50.  Plaintiff FLORENCE FLORES has worked in the Los Angeles Unified School \nDistrict (L.A.U.S.D.) for twenty-five years, beginning as a teacher's aide at the age of 18.  Due \nto the high quality of her work as a teacher's aide, FLORES was provided with a grant by \nL.A.U.S.D. to attend college and obtain a teaching credential. \n   51.  FLORES obtained an Elementary Education/Multiple Subjects teaching credential \nin 1976, which became a life credential in 1982 and remains valid to the present. \n  52.  Since 1976 FLORES, who is bilingual, has taught bilingual and non-bilingual \nclasses and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes at the elementary level.  She has also \ntaught ESL classes and Vocational English as a Second Language classes in Adult Education.   \n  53.  For the past six years FLORES has served in a variety of capacities as a counselor \nand as a quasi-administrator at Pacoima Skills Center, a vocational skills training center of \nL.A.U.S.D. where she has developed programs and services to provide career and employment \nopportunities for students.   \n  54.  Approximately 85% of the center's student population is Latino.   \n  55.  Some of the positions FLORES has held at the Pacoima Skills Center include \nserving as the GAIN Coordinator in which position she directed the center's efforts to provide \n \n \n \n  12 \n\nwelfare recipients with a high school education, as Coordinator of the center's Amnesty \nProgram pursuant to the 1986 Immigration Reform Act, as a Jobs Training Partnership Act \nYouth Counselor, a Recruitment Counselor, a Summer Youth Employment Coordinator, and \nher most recent position as a Special Projects Counselor.   \n  56.  FLORES' minimum competency as an educator and administrator has been more \nthan established by the consistent high praise she has received from her supervising principals \nand from the district's Assistant Superintendent who have described her as highly motivated \nand unusually effective in the performance of her teaching duties; as possessing superior \nvitality, energy, and judgment; as being resourceful and exceptionally quick to understand; as \ndeeply involved in improving the instructional program for students and as generally well-\nsuited to serving as an administrator.    \n  57.  One of FLORES' supervising principals has said that he knows of no other \ninstructor who could operate in the type of difficult facility in which he observed her work and \ncreate such a successful program.  He found her talents, rapport with staff, students and \nadministrators, and concern for students all to be first-rate. \n  58.  FLORES' immediate supervisors have not been alone in recognizing her superior \nskills as an educator and administrator.  In 1989, FLORES received an Outstanding Educator \nAward from the L.A. Unified School Board in recognition of her exemplary teaching and \ndedication to limited English-proficient students.  In 1991, FLORES received AMAE's \nOutstanding Adult Education Teacher of the Year Award. \n \n \n  f.  Sam Genis \n \n \n \n  13 \n\n  59.  Plaintiff SAM GENIS is a Latino man, residing in Los Angeles County in the State \nof California. \n  60.  GENIS is a member of the Association of Mexican-American Educators. \n  61.  GENIS desires to obtain a Multiple Subjects credential with a Bilingual Emphasis \nin Spanish for teaching bilingual classes at the elementary level and a Single Subjects \ncredential in Spanish for teaching at the secondary level in the public schools. \n  62.  The essential minimum requirements for the issuance of a teaching credential -- \nwhether a multiple subjects or a single subject -- are possession of a baccalaureate degree; \ncompletion of an approved fifth-year credentialing program at an institution of higher \neducation; passage of the National Teacher's Examination (\"NTE\") in the appropriate subject \nmatter area or completion of an approved waiver program of approximately 60-130 semester \nunits of coursework; and passage of the CBEST.  §§ 44259; 44252(b). \n  63.  GENIS has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  64.  He has fully completed the course work and field work for his Multiple Subjects \ncredential and is two courses away from fulfilling the credential program requirements for his \nSingle Subject credential. \n  65.  The Defendants are denying GENIS a teaching credential and, thereby, the \nopportunity to obtain employment as a teacher in the public schools solely as a result of his \nCBEST scores. \n  66.  Though he has passed the math and the writing sections and has scored enough \noverall points to pass the CBEST, GENIS has missed by one point obtaining the score set by \nthe State and the CTC as the lowest permissible score on the reading section.   \n  67.  At the time the CBEST requirement took effect in 1983, Plaintiff SAM GENIS was \n \n \n \n  14 \n\nteaching his third year on an emergency credential in El Rancho Unified School District where \nhe consistently received excellent evaluations as a teacher. \n  68.  In order for an emergency credential to be issued, the applicant's school district \nmust first verify to the CTC that it is experiencing a shortage of credentialed teachers.  § \n44300(a).  Many, if not most, large school districts have received approval from the CTC for \nobtaining emergency permits. \n  69.  The essential minimum requirements for an emergency multiple or single subject \nteaching credential include possession of a baccalaureate degree; intent to enroll or enrollment \nin a credentialing program; passage of the NTE or completion of 10-15 semester units of \ncoursework; and, since 1983, passage of the CBEST.   \n  70.  Emergency permits are generally valid for only one year.  § 44251(a)(4).  Yet, once \nissued, they are generally renewed as long as the district's verification of teacher shortage has \nnot lapsed.   \n  71.  An individual who has passed the CBEST but who has not fulfilled all the other \nrequirements for a regular teaching credential, such as passage of the NTE, or completion of a \ncredentialing program, can often teach for a number of years on an emergency credential. \n  72.  Because of his failure to pass the CBEST, as required of all emergency credential \nholders, GENIS lost his job at El Rancho Unified School District. \n  73.  El Rancho Unified School District has continued to contact GENIS in the ensuing \nyears with the hope of reemploying him upon his obtaining a teaching credential from the State \nand the CTC.   \n  74.  After losing his job in the El Rancho Unified School District, GENIS obtained \nemployment at St. Benedict's School, a parochial school in Montabello, California, serving \n \n \n \n  15 \n\ngrades kindergarten through eight.  St. Benedict's student population is 95% Latino.   \n  75.  At St. Benedict's, GENIS's consistently received excellent evaluations as an \nelementary teacher and as an eighth grade math teacher.   \n  76.  GENIS further served the students of St. Benedict's by initiating several successful \nacademic and social service programs which provide remedial and enrichment classes for \ntargeted students and extended day care for struggling working parents and, further, by \ndevoting himself to a full array of extracurricular activities including serving as Athletic \nDirector, Yearbook, and Student Council Advisor.   \n  77.  Plaintiff SAM GENIS demonstrated a sufficiently high level of competence as a \nteacher and educator such that the St. Benedict's School administration appointed him Vice-\nPrincipal of the school for the regular academic year program, and full Principal of the school's \n400-student strong summer program. \n  78.  GENIS has recently left St. Benedict's and moved to St. John's Bosco High School \nin Bellflower, California so that he can gain experience as a secondary Spanish teacher.  At St. \nJohn's, GENIS teaches Spanish for Native Speakers.  His classes are 85% Latino. \n \n  g. Viry Kem \n  79.  Plaintiff VIRY KEM is an Asian man, residing in Sacramento County in the State \nof California. \n  80.  KEM, who was born in Cambodia and whose first language is Khmer, desires to \nobtain a Multiple Subjects credential with a Bilingual Emphasis in Khmer for teaching \nbilingual classes at the elementary level in the public schools.  \n  81.  KEM would be one of only a handful of Khmer-speakers credentialed by \n \n \n \n  16 \n\nDefendants to address the needs of over 24,000 Khmer-speaking students in California's public \nschools. \n  82.  KEM has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n    83.  Though he has passed the math and writing sections and has scored enough overall \npoints to pass the CBEST, VIRY KEM is four points short of obtaining the score set by the \nState and the CTC as the lowest permissible score on the reading section. \n  84.  Plaintiff VIRY KEM has fully completed the course work and field work and all \nother requirements for his Multiple Subjects credential. \n  85.  The State and the CTC are preventing KEM from obtaining his teaching credential \nand, thereby, the opportunity to obtain employment as a teacher in the public schools solely as \na result of his failure to obtain a score on the reading section of the CBEST at a level deemed \npassing by the Defendants.   \n  86.  KEM has amply demonstrated his ability to read English at the college level by \nhaving successfully completed both a post-graduate teacher preparation program at the \nCalifornia State University, Sacramento (\"CSUS\") and the program for a Bachelor's degree in \nLiberal Studies, also at CSUS, with a 3.18 grade point average. \n  87.  In addition to fulfilling all the academic, student teaching, and other teacher \npreparation requirements, KEM has otherwise demonstrated his competence as a teacher by \nway of the consistently positive evaluations he has received for his teaching skills in a variety \nof educational settings over the last eleven years. \n  88.  In 1981, while himself a refugee fleeing Cambodia, KEM successfully served as an \ninstructor and Khmer-English interpreter for the United Nations High Commission on \nRefugees at the U.N. refugee camp on Bataan Island in the Philippines. \n \n \n \n  17 \n\n  89.  From 1982 to 1987, KEM successfully served as a Bilingual Program Aide on the \njunior and senior high school level for limited English-proficient students from Asia and Latin \nAmerica in the public schools of Oklahoma. \n  90.  From 1988 to 1989, KEM worked at Golden State Middle School in the \nWashington Unified School District as a Bilingual Instructional Aide.  His supervisor there \nrated his performance outstanding, finding him to be thorough and competent, professional, \nwarm, and an effective problem-solver with excellent judgment. \n  91.  KEM, likewise, has received positive evaluations for the teaching skills exhibited in \nhis teacher preparation program at CSUS.  His supervisor at the elementary school where he \nstudent-taught full-time for a semester found his work highly commendable, and found KEM \npersonally dedicated, hard-working, and in possession of a special commitment to the teaching \nprofession.  One of his professors at CSUS found Plaintiff VIRY KEM not only distinguished \nhimself as an outstanding writer and verbal contributor to class, but more generally, as an \noutstanding student and a brilliant educator, rating KEM as already better than 90% of the \nteachers currently practicing. \n  92.  KEM is currently working part-time as a guidance counselor and student mentor at \nCSUS while he continues to retake the CBEST. \n  93.  Unable to obtain employment as a teacher in the public schools, Plaintiff VIRY \nKEM has been forced to continue his regimen of part-time work and retaking the CBEST.  If \nhe does not soon prevail with regard to the CBEST, he will be forced to seek employment in \nanother field to the detriment of California's Khmer-speaking student population. \n \n  h. Toua Yang \n \n \n \n  18 \n\n  94.  Plaintiff TOUA YANG is an Asian man, residing in Sacramento County in the \nState of California. \n  95.  YANG is Hmong, an ethnic group deriving from regions of Southeast Asia and \nsouthern China.  He was born in Laos in 1963 and lived there until 1975 when he moved with \nhis family to Thailand.  YANG lived in Thailand for ten years, until late 1984 when he moved \nto the United States.  Consequently, YANG is multi-lingual, speaking Hmong, Lao, Thai, and \nEnglish fluently. \n  96.  YANG desires to obtain a Multiple Subjects credential with a Bilingual Emphasis \nin Hmong, Lao, and Thai, for teaching bilingual classes at the elementary level in the public \nschools.  \n  97.  YANG would be one of only a handful of bilingual-speakers credentialed by \nDefendants to address the needs of over 21,000 Hmong-speaking, 16,000 Lao-speaking, and \n1,800 Thai-speaking students in California's public schools. \n  98.  YANG has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n    99.  Though he has passed the math and writing sections, YANG has not yet obtained a \nscore on the reading section at a level which the Defendants deem passing. \n  100.  Though YANG is otherwise fully qualified to obtain an emergency teaching \ncredential, he has elected to pursue study in a one-and-a-half year teacher preparation program \nso that he can directly obtain his preliminary teaching credential.  He will complete his teacher \npreparation program and otherwise be qualified to obtain a Multiple Subjects credential in \nDecember 1993. \n  101.  The State and the CTC are preventing YANG from obtaining a teaching credential \nand, thereby, the opportunity to obtain employment as a teacher in the public schools solely as \n \n \n \n  19 \n\na result of his failure to obtain a score on the CBEST at a level deemed passing by the \nDefendants. \n  102.  YANG has amply demonstrated his ability to read English at the college level by \nhaving successfully completed the program for a Bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies at the \nCalifornia State University, Sacramento and most of the first semester of the CSUS teacher \npreparation program with a cumulative grade point average of approximately 3.0. \n  103.  As further evidence of his ample intellectual abilities, Plaintiff TOUA YANG \nconsistently ranked among the top students in both Laos and Thailand on standardized national \nachievement tests.  In both third and sixth grade, for example, his achievement test scores were \nsecond in the nation among thousands of students at his grade level. \n  104.  TOUA YANG has otherwise demonstrated his competence as a teacher by way of \nthe consistently positive evaluations he has received for his teaching skills in a variety of \neducational settings over the last twelve years. \n  105.  From 1980 to 1984, YANG successfully served as a teacher in a primary school in \nThailand. \n  106.  Since beginning his undergraduate studies, YANG has worked as a teacher's aide \nin three different elementary school settings. \n  107.  His supervisors have found him to be an exceptional individual, a self-motivator \nwith an extremely positive attitude, one who displays a tremendous sensitivity towards \nchildren from various ethnolinguistic backgrounds and, as such, is able to teach to a wide array \nof learning modalities. \n \n  i. Robert Williams \n \n \n \n  20 \n\n  108.  Plaintiff ROBERT WILLIAMS is an African American man, residing in Alameda \nCounty in the State of California.  He is seeking employment in the public schools of Alameda \nCounty, California and in that county has taken the CBEST on numerous occasions. \n  109.  ROBERT WILLIAMS is seeking an administrative services credential in order to \nregain his position as an Assistant Principal. \n  110.  He has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  111.  Though he has passed the reading and writing sections and has scored enough \noverall points to pass the CBEST, ROBERT WILLIAMS is six points short of obtaining the \nscore set by the State and the CTC as the lowest permissible score on the math section. \n  112.  He has fully completed the coursework and fieldwork and all other requirements \nfor an administrative credential. \n  113.  The Defendants are denying ROBERT WILLIAMS an administrative credential \nand, thereby, the opportunity to obtain employment as an administrator in the public schools \nsolely as a result of his CBEST scores on the math section. \n  114.  Plaintiff ROBERT WILLIAMS graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Education \nfrom Linfield College in the State of Oregon in 1974 at which time he received a credential to \nteach in Oregon's public schools.  In 1975, ROBERT WILLIAMS graduated from the STEP \nProgram at Stanford University at which time he received a Master's degree in Physical \nEducation from Stanford and a credential for the teaching of Physical Education from the \nDefendants.  Additionally, ROBERT WILLIAMS possesses a public school teaching \ncredential from the State of Alaska. \n  115.  Plaintiff ROBERT WILLIAMS has taught Physical Education for four years in \nAlaska in the Anchorage Unified School District and for five years in California in the San \n \n \n \n  21 \n\nLeandro Unified School District. \n  116.  During his time in the Anchorage Unified School District, he consistently received \nhigh praise and excellent evaluations as an educator. \n  117.  Similarly, during his time in the San Leandro Unified School District, he has \nconsistently received high praise and excellent evaluations as an educator.  His instructional \ntechniques and strategies have been rated exemplary.  Moreover, as a teacher, he was \nparticularly commended for his excellent leadership potential and for the extent to which his \nattitude, countenance, and skill level make him an excellent role mode for students. \n  118.  Further evidence of Plaintiff ROBERT WILLIAMS' more than minimally \ncompetent skills as an educator is the fact that he was appointed by the San Leandro Unified \nSchool District to the position of Assistant Principal at San Leandro High School from \nNovember 1990 to June 1992.  He was able to fill an administrative position without having an \nadministrative credential under a temporary \"Teacher on Special Assignment\" program. \n  119.  ROBERT WILLIAMS' major duties as Assistant Principal included overseeing \ncampus supervision, the Social Studies and Physical Education programs, the athletics \nprogram, the student conflict resolution program, the peer counseling program, and the library \nand textbook program. \n  120.  None of these duties required the type or degree of math required to achieve a \npassing score on the math section of the CBEST. \n  121.  Plaintiff ROBERT WILLIAMS was more than a minimally competent \nadministrator during his two years as Assistant Principal.  His supervisors on the school site \nand district level rated his work as outstanding, finding him effective, excellent, and superior in \nthe full range of his duties.  His colleagues recognized his special effectiveness in building \n \n \n \n  22 \n\npositive relationships with the growing population of African American males at San Leandro \nHigh School and lauded his ability to serve these young people as a strong, positive role model \nand to provide them and their parents with a sense of belonging to the school. \n  122.  As further evidence of his potential as an administrator, ROBERT WILLIAMS \nwas admitted to a special \"Leadership Training Program\" at the School of Education at \nCalifornia State University, Hayward for the training of promising future public school \nadministrators. \n  123.  ROBERT WILLIAMS has also demonstrated his administrative and leadership \nability by way of his extensive involvement in the affairs of the school district and the greater \nlocal community.  ROBERT WILLIAMS has established the Martin Luther King, Jr. Service \nAward for recognizing outstanding individual contributions from students, staff, and \ncommunity members to the San Leandro School District.  He has also been elected by his peers \nto serve as Vice-President of the San Leandro Teachers' Association and to serve on the \nMentor-Teacher Nominating Committee.  Additionally, he recently has been appointed to the \nBoard of Directors of the San Leandro Community Council, a non-profit, grass roots, \ncommunity service organization. \n  124.  Because he has not passed the CBEST, ROBERT WILLIAMS' efforts to obtain an \nadministrative credential and, thereby, to continue his career in education as an administrator \nhave been thwarted, forcing him to return to teaching Physical Education. \n \n  j.  Frank Rivera \n  125.  Plaintiff FRANK RIVERA is a Latino man, residing in Los Angeles County in the \nState of California. \n \n \n \n  23 \n\n  126.  He has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  127.  RIVERA is being denied the opportunity to return to employment as a bilingual \nteacher in the public schools by the Defendants solely as a result of his CBEST scores.   \n  128.  RIVERA already holds life credentials in both Standard Elementary Education \nand Standard Secondary Education and has served as a classroom teacher on the elementary or \nsecondary level for approximately 15 out of the last 27 years.   \n  129.  During his years in the classroom, RIVERA has performed competently, receiving \nevaluations rating him satisfactory to outstanding in the performance of his teaching duties. \n  130.  The Defendants have revoked their previously unconditional life authorization to \nRIVERA to teach, regardless of the fact that he has performed competently, and have required \nthat he pass the CBEST before returning to the classroom since he was not employed in a \ncertificated position in the public schools for a period exceeding thirty-nine months.  See § \n44830(c).  (As used herein, \"certificated\" refers to those positions or personnel requiring \ncredentials.) \n  131.  In addition to his life credentials in elementary and secondary education, RIVERA \nhas earned several other credentials during his twenty-seven year career in education.  These \ninclude a General Services Administrative Credential, a life Supervisor/Instructional \nCredential, a life Adult Education Credential, a life Community College Credential, and \ncertification as a Teacher of English to Speakers of Other Languages.   \n  132.  In addition to his successful efforts as a classroom teacher, RIVERA has been \nemployed as an administrator of categorical programs at the district and state level, primarily \nthose dealing with migrant and bilingual education and the return of high school drop outs to \nthe public school system. \n \n \n \n  24 \n\n  133.  During the period in which RIVERA was not employed in a certificated position \nin the public schools for a period exceeding thirty-nine months, he did not leave the field of \neducation but served, rather, in parochial schools.  RIVERA taught English, Reading, and \nReligion at St. Thomas More Parish School for two years, at which time he demonstrated a \nsufficiently high level of competence in the classroom that he was appointed principal of All \nSouls Parish School by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles for a one-year period. \n \n  k.  Ricardo Peinado \n  134.  Plaintiff RICARDO PEINADO is a Latino man, residing in Los Angeles County \nin the State of California. \n  135.  PEINADO is seeking a Pupil Personnel Services Credential in order to obtain \nemployment as a counselor in the public schools. \n  136.  The essential minimum requirements for a counseling credential are possession of \na baccalaureate degree; completion of an approved fifth-year credentialing program at an \ninstitution of higher education; and passage of the CBEST.  §§ 44266; 44252(b). \n  137.  PEINADO has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  138.  PEINADO has fully completed the course work and field work and all other \nrequirements for his Pupil Personnel Services credential \n  139.  The Defendants are denying him said credential and, thereby, the opportunity to \nobtain employment as a counselor in the public schools, solely as a result of his CBEST scores. \n  140.  Though he has passed the math and writing sections, as of yet, PEINADO has not \nattained a score on the reading section of the test at a level which the Defendants deem passing.  \n  141.  Plaintiff RICARDO PEINADO has demonstrated his ample fitness to serve as an \n \n \n \n  25 \n\nentry level counselor in the public schools, including whatever level of reading skill is \nnecessary to perform the critical or important aspects of the job of counseling elementary or \nsecondary school children, by successfully graduating from the University of California at \nIrvine, and by completing the course work and field work for a counseling credential and for a \nMaster's degree in Counseling with a 3.61 grade point average at the California State \nUniversity, Los Angeles. \n \n  l.  Marta Leclaire \n  142.  Plaintiff MARTA LECLAIRE is a Latino woman, residing in Alameda County in \nthe State of California.  She is seeking employment in the public schools of Alameda County, \nCalifornia and in that county has taken the CBEST on numerous occasions. \n  143.  LECLAIRE, whose first language is Spanish, desires to obtain a Multiple Subjects \ncredential with a Bilingual Emphasis in Spanish for teaching bilingual kindergarten classes in \nthe public schools.  \n  144.  LECLAIRE has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  145.  LECLAIRE has fully completed the course work and field work for her Multiple \nSubjects credential. \n  146.  The State and the CTC are denying LECLAIRE her teaching credential and, \nthereby, the opportunity to obtain employment as a teacher in the public schools solely as a \nresult of her CBEST scores.   \n  147.  For the past three years, LECLAIRE has taught a bilingual preschool class and an \nafterschool enrichment class for early school-age children at El Centro Infantil de la Raza, a \nState-funded early childhood development center in the Oakland Unified School District.  \n \n \n \n  26 \n\n  148.  El Centro's student population is 95% Latino.   \n  149.  During the decade-and-a-half prior to her work at El Centro, LECLAIRE spent \nseven years teaching at a State preschool in San Francisco and at a State early childhood \ndevelopment center in the Oakland Unified School District. \n  150.  In addition to her teacher preparation, Plaintiff MARTA LECLAIRE has \ndemonstrated her competence as a primary teacher by way of her consistently excellent \nevaluations while at El Centro and at the State preschool programs at which she has worked.   \n  151.  LECLAIRE has further demonstrated her expertise in early childhood \ndevelopment by way of her appointment as a consultant to the Nicaraguan Ministry of \nEducation on early childhood development and her work as an educational television producer \nin Nicaragua where she produced fourteen documentaries on child development, teacher \ntraining, and parental involvement.  Two of LECLAIRE's films won awards at international \neducation film and television production competitions in Tokyo, Japan and Havana, Cuba. \n  152.  LECLAIRE's more than minimum qualifications as a primary teacher are further \nevidenced by the numerous invitations she has received from Oakland Unified and other \nschool districts, from statewide educational organizations, and from the State Department of \nEducation to provide presentations and trainings on her innovative methods for designing early \nchildhood development lesson plans. \n \n  m.  Antoinette Williams \n  153.  Plaintiff ANTOINETTE WILLIAMS is an African American woman, residing in \nAlameda County in the State of California.  She is seeking employment in the public schools \nof Alameda County, California and in that county has taken the CBEST on numerous \n \n \n \n  27 \n\noccasions. \n  154.  ANTOINETTE WILLIAMS seeks to obtain an emergency substitute teaching \ncredential so that she can finance her post-baccalaureate teacher preparation education by \nsubstituting in the public schools. \n  155.  The essential minimum requirements for an emergency substitute teaching \ncredential are possession of a baccalaureate degree and passage of the CBEST.  Title 5, \nCalifornia Code of Regulations, § 80025. \n  156.  ANTOINETTE WILLIAMS has taken and failed the CBEST. \n  157.  She has fulfilled all other requirements for the substitute teaching credential.   \n  158.  ANTOINETTE WILLIAMS is being denied a substitute teaching credential by the \nDefendants and, thereby, the opportunity to obtain employment as a teacher in the public \nschools solely as a result of her CBEST scores.   \n  159.  ANTOINETTE WILLIAMS has demonstrated her competency to become a \nsubstitute teacher at the elementary or secondary level by having successfully taught for three \nyears at Merritt College in Oakland, California and in a substitute position in the State of \nMissouri.   \n  160.  She has otherwise demonstrated her competencies in the field of education by \noperating what is believed to be California's first school of security and investigation training, \ndesigning the school's curriculum, and writing one of its standard texts.   \n  161.  Further evidence of Plaintiff ANTOINETTE WILLIAMS' fitness of character and \npotential to serve as an inspirational role model to her students of color can be seen in her \ntwenty years of successful work in the criminal justice field as, among other positions, a \nfederal probation officer, a deputy sheriff, and as what is believed to be California's first \n \n \n \n  28 \n\nlicensed African American woman private investigator. \n \n  n.  Diana Kwan \n  162.  Plaintiff DIANA KWAN is an Asian woman, residing in the City and County of \nSan Francisco in the State of California.  She is seeking employment in the public schools of \nthe City and County of San Francisco, California and in that county has taken the CBEST on \nnumerous occasions. \n  163.  KWAN, who was born in mainland China, is fluent in both Mandarin and \nCantonese.  She desires to obtain a Multiple Subjects credential with a Bilingual Emphasis in \nCantonese for teaching bilingual classes at the elementary level in the public schools.  \n  164.  KWAN has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  165.  Though KWAN has passed the math and writing sections of the test and has \nobtained the minimum passing score on the reading section, her overall score remains four \npoints below the total score deemed passing by the Defendants. \n  166.  Though KWAN is otherwise fully qualified to obtain an emergency teaching \ncredential, she would prefer to begin study in a one-year teacher preparation program so that \nshe can directly obtain her preliminary teaching credential.  She has been informed by the \nprogram of her choice, however, that she will not be admitted without having passed the \nCBEST. \n  167.  Based on her inability to pursue a course of teacher training and the knowledge \nthat upon completion of a teacher preparation program, she would nonetheless be prevented \nfrom obtaining a credential absent CBEST passage, KWAN has been forced to seek and obtain \nemployment outside the education field. \n \n \n \n  29 \n\n  168.  Were the CBEST requirement eliminated, KWAN would immediately seek \nadmittance to her chosen credentialing program, for which she is otherwise fully qualified, in \norder to obtain a preliminary teaching credential. \n  169.  The State and the CTC are preventing KWAN from obtaining a teaching \ncredential and, thereby, the opportunity to obtain employment as a teacher in the public schools \nsolely as a result of her failure to obtain an overall score on the CBEST at a level deemed \npassing by the Defendants. \n  170.  KWAN has demonstrated her possession of the requisite level of reading skills in \nEnglish necessary to performing the critical or important aspects of the job of teaching \nbilingual classes by completing a rigorous Liberal Studies degree in a California State \nUniversity program with a 3.3 grade point average. \n  171.  KWAN has otherwise demonstrated her competence as a bilingual teacher by way \nof the consistently positive evaluations she has received for her teaching skills over the last \nseveral years during which time she has served both as a teacher's aide at the Chinese \nAmerican International School and as a teacher in various community-based summer school \nprograms for Chinese youth. \n \n  o.  Jaime Lara \n  172.  Plaintiff JAIME LARA is a Latino man, residing in Los Angeles County in the \nState of California. \n  173.  LARA, whose first language is Spanish, desires to obtain a Single Subject \ncredential in Spanish in order to teach advanced Spanish, primarily to native speakers, at the \nsecondary level.  LARA is immediately seeking an emergency credential so that he can teach \n \n \n \n  30 \n\nwhile undertaking a fifth-year teacher preparation program at California State University, \nDominguez Hills.   \n  174.  LARA has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  175.  LARA has fully completed all other requirements for obtaining an emergency \ncredential.   \n  176.  The State and the CTC are preventing him from obtaining a teaching credential \nand, thereby, the opportunity to obtain employment as a teacher in the public schools solely as \na result of his CBEST scores.   \n  177.  For the last six years, LARA has been a bilingual teacher's aide for thirty hours a \nweek in math and English classes in public schools in the cities of Wilmington and Carson, \nCalifornia.   \n  178.  In addition to having fulfilled the other requirements for an emergency credential, \nLARA has demonstrated his fitness for the entry-level position he seeks by way of his \nexperience as a bilingual aide and the excellent evaluations he has received concerning his \nteaching skills.   \n  179.  Plaintiff JAIME LARA has been informed by two different schools that teaching \npositions would be available for him during the 1992-1993 school year were he to obtain his \nemergency credential. \n \n  p.  Joyce Santiago \n  180.  Plaintiff JOYCE SANTIAGO is a Latino woman, residing in San Bernadino \nCounty in the State of California. \n  181.  SANTIAGO ultimately desires to obtain a Specialist Credential with Bilingual \n \n \n \n  31 \n\nCertification in order to teach bilingual and regular special education classes.  She is currently \nattempting to maintain an emergency teaching credential while she completes a credential \nprogram and a Master's degree in Special Education at California State Polytechnic University, \nPomona.   \n  182.  SANTIAGO has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  183.  Except for CBEST passage, SANTIAGO has completed all other requirements for \nan Emergency Specialist Credential and, upon completion of her coursework, will have \ncompleted all other requirements for a regular Specialist Credential.   \n  184.  Plaintiff JOYCE SANTIAGO possesses a Bachelor's degree in Elementary \nEducation and a valid Elementary Education teaching credential from Puerto Rico. \n  185.  Prior to moving to California in 1990, SANTIAGO taught for three years in the \npublic schools of Lawrence, Massachusetts as a special education teacher in a Resource \nSpecialist Program and as a second grade bilingual teacher.   \n  186.  SANTIAGO has taught a special education class for the last two years, and is \nbeginning a third year, on one-year emergency credentials in the Pomona Unified School \nDistrict. \n  187.  SANTIAGO has demonstrated her competence to teach in the public schools of \nCalifornia based on her professional preparation to date and on her actual job performance in \nthe Massachusetts and the Pomona Unified systems where SANTIAGO's supervisors have \nrated the quality of her work as better than average to exemplary. \n  188.  Similarly, her current principal has attested to SANTIAGO's having created a \nlearning environment in her class that promotes confidence and cooperation; to her \ndemonstrating a sympathetic understanding of the myriad of problems her students possess; to \n \n \n \n  32 \n\nher being able to develop lesson plans to meet those varied needs; as well as to her ability to \ncounsel and assist individual pupils in a positive and comforting manner.   \n  189.  In her first year in the Pomona Unified School District, SANTIAGO was able to \nteach without having passed the CBEST pursuant to a One Year Nonrenewable Credential. \n  190.  The One Year Nonrenewable Credential is a special credential for individuals \ncredentialed outside of California who have met all the requirements for an initial California \ncredential except for passing the CBEST and who have passed a district administered basic \nskills test.  See §§ 44252(b)(3); 44830(m). \n  191.  For her two subsequent years, SANTIAGO has been able to serve as a special \neducation teacher despite not having passed the CBEST only by receiving special waivers from \nthe State Board of Education in recognition of her qualifications as a teacher, of the school's \ngreat need for her skills, and of her competent performance in the position during the past two \nyears. \n \n  q.  Maribel Diaz  \n  192.  Plaintiff MARIBEL DIAZ is a Latino woman, residing in San Bernadino County \nin the State of California. \n  193.  DIAZ ultimately desires to obtain a Specialist Credential with Bilingual \nCertification in order to teach bilingual and regular special education classes.  She is currently \nattempting to maintain an emergency teaching credential while she completes a credential \nprogram and a Master's degree in Special Education at California State Polytechnic University, \nPomona.   \n  194.  DIAZ has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n \n \n \n  33 \n\n  195.  Except for CBEST passage, DIAZ has completed all other requirements for an \nEmergency Specialist Credential and, upon completion of her coursework, will have completed \nall other requirements for a regular Specialist Credential.   \n  196.  Plaintiff MARIBEL DIAZ possesses a Bachelor's degree in Elementary Education \nand a valid Elementary Education teaching credential from Puerto Rico. \n  197.  Subsequent to receiving her degree and credential, DIAZ taught Spanish in an \nelementary school for a year and a half in Puerto Rico. \n  198.  Subsequent to her teaching experience in Puerto Rico and prior to moving to \nCalifornia in 1991, DIAZ taught for two years in the public schools of Chelsea, Massachusetts \nas a special education teacher.   \n  199.  DIAZ taught last year, and is teaching again this year, a special education class in \nthe Pomona Unified School District. \n  200.  DIAZ has demonstrated her competence to teach in the public schools in \nCalifornia based on her professional preparation to date and on her actual job performance in \nthe Massachusetts and the Pomona Unified systems where DIAZ's supervisors have rated the \nquality of her work as strong to excellent and have found her to be energetic and highly \ncompetent, possessing all the qualities of an excellent teacher. \n  201.  In her first year in the Pomona Unified School District, DIAZ was able to teach \nwithout having passed the CBEST pursuant to a One Year Nonrenewable Credential. \n  202.  For the present year, DIAZ has been able to serve as a special education teacher \ndespite not having passed the CBEST only by receiving a special waiver from the State Board \nof Education in recognition of her qualifications as an teacher, of the school's great need for \nher skills, and of her competent performance in the position to date. \n \n \n \n  34 \n\n \n  r. Agnes Haynes \n  203.  Plaintiff AGNES HAYNES is an African American woman, residing in Santa \nClara County in the State of California where she has taken the CBEST on numerous \noccasions.  She is seeking to maintain her current employment in the public schools of San \nMateo County, California. \n  204.  AGNES HAYNES is seeking a Single Subject credential in English in order to \ncontinue teaching her eighth grade English classes at Belle Haven School in the Ravenswood \nCity School District. \n  205.  She has taken and failed the CBEST on several occasions. \n  206.  Though she has passed the reading and writing sections, AGNES HAYNES has \nnot obtained the score set by the State and the CTC as the lowest permissible score on the math \nsection. \n  207.  She has fully completed the coursework and fieldwork and all other requirements \nfor a Single Subject credential. \n  208.  The Defendants are denying AGNES HAYNES a Single Subject credential and, \nthereby, the opportunity to obtain unconditional employment as a teacher in the public schools \nsolely as a result of her CBEST scores. \n  209.  Plaintiff AGNES HAYNES graduated with a Bachelor's degree in English from \nGrambling State University in the State of Louisiana in 1964.  She possesses a lifetime \ncredential for teaching English and Social Studies in the State of Louisiana.  Prior to moving to \nCalifornia, she taught English for thirteen years in grades nine through twelve in the public \nschools of Louisiana. \n \n \n \n  35 \n\n  210.  During her time in the public schools of Louisiana, HAYNES consistently \nreceived high praise and excellent evaluations for her skills as a teacher. \n  211.  HAYNES has recently returned to the teaching profession, substituting in the \nRavenswood City School District last year, and being assigned to her own full-time classroom \nat Belle Haven School for the 1992-1993 academic year. \n  212.  Both during her time as a substitute and as a full-time teacher in the Ravenswood \nCity School District, HAYNES has consistently received high praise and excellent evaluations. \n Her supervisors have found her to possess both an excellent command of the subject matter \nand superlative classroom management skills. \n  213.  Her current classes at Belle Haven School are made up entirely of students of \ncolor, approximately two-thirds of whom are African American. \n  214.  Plaintiff AGNES HAYNES has neither studied nor needed for thirty years the \ntype or degree of math required to pass the CBEST. Neither her past nor current duties as an \nEnglish teacher require the type or degree of math needed to pass the CBEST. \n  215.  HAYNES has also enrolled in an administrative credentialing program at San Jose \nState University which she expects to complete in the Spring of 1994. \n  216.  In addition to her teaching efforts and her goal of serving as a school \nadministrator, AGNES HAYNES has also demonstrated her prominent role in the community \nthrough her work with the Big Sisters organization and with her selection as Second Vice-\nPresident of the California State Baptist Convention, Women's Department and past President \nof the Bay Area Baptist District Association, Women's Division. \n  217.  HAYNES was able to substitute last year and to teach in September and October \nof this year without having passed the CBEST by way of a One Year Nonrenewable \n \n \n \n  36 \n\nCredential, having already been credentialed in another state. \n  218.  For the remainder of the current school year, HAYNES will be able to teach \nabsent CBEST passage under a special one-year waiver from the State Board of Education, \nbased on her qualifications as a teacher, the school's great need for her skills, and her \ncompetent performance to date.  \n  219.  Absent a further special waiver from the State Board of Education, HAYNES will \nlose her job at the end of the current school year if she does not pass the CBEST math section \nbefore then.  Likewise, she will be unable to obtain an administrative credential in the future \nabsent passage of the CBEST math section. \n \n \n  DEFENDANTS \n  220.  Defendant STATE OF CALIFORNIA is a state government imbued with \nlegislative, executive, and judicial powers, created by the Constitution of the State of \nCalifornia pursuant to the mandate of its citizens, and adopted into the Union of the United \nStates of America in 1850.   \n  221.  Defendant California COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING \n(\"CTC\") (formerly a division of the California Department of Education and known as the \nCommission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing) is an independent state governmental \nagency to which the Defendant STATE OF CALIFORNIA has delegated broad powers for \ndeveloping and administering the standards, assessments, and examinations -- including, inter \nalia, the CBEST -- for entry and advancement in certificated positions in the public schools of \nCalifornia.  §§ 44225; 44252.5. \n \n \n \n  37 \n\n \n \n  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n  222.  The individual Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff organizations seek to maintain this \naction on behalf of themselves, the Plaintiff organizations' members, and the class of Latino, \nAfrican American, and Asian California public school credential or job applicants past, \npresent, and future who have been or will be denied credentials or certificated positions based \non the California Basic Educational Skills Test. \n  223.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) as the Defendants have acted with regard to the CBEST and the issuance of \ncredentials on grounds generally applicable to the asserted class, thereby making final \ninjunctive relief appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n  224.  This action is further maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(a) in that: \n    (a)  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nThousands of putative members are believed to exist.  In the past few \nyears alone, an annual average of approximately 40,000 individuals have \ntaken the CBEST for the first time, 20% of whom were either Latino, \nAfrican American, or Asian. \n \n    (b)  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, such as the legal \nstatus of the Defendants as employers under Title VII, the validity of the \nCBEST, and the existence of equivalent, less-discriminatory alternatives. \n \n    (c)  The claims of the representative parties, in as much as they represent \nindividuals who have all been or will be prevented from obtaining their \ncredentials solely based on CBEST scores are typical of the claims of the \nclass. \n \n    (d)  The representatives and their attorneys, who are experienced civil rights, \neducation, and employment litigators, will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class. \n \n \n \n  38 \n\n \n \n \n  COUNT I:  TITLE VII \n  a.  Employer Status \n  225.  Defendant STATE OF CALIFORNIA is an \"employer\" of the aggrieved Plaintiff \nclass of public school credential applicants within the meaning of Title VII of the 1964 Civil \nRights Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., in that, inter alia: \n  226.  The State regularly employs fifteen or more persons; \n  227.  The State has established, pursuant to its mandate to provide and govern one \ncommon free Public School System, Cal. Const. art. IX, §§ 5, 6, 14, the minimum standards \nfor employment in certificated positions in the public schools, §§ 44250 et seq., 44830(a); \n  228.  The State has not established employment standards for non-public schools under \nthe provisions of its credentialing process, see, e.g., §§ 44203(d), 44225(b)(1), 44225(d), \n44252(b);  \n  229.  The State has, as part of its public school credentialing process, interfered with the \nPlaintiff class's ability to obtain employment with local public school districts by mandating \nCBEST passage as a condition of employment, §§ 44252, 44830; \n  230.  The State is authorized to provide, create, and govern one common free Public \nSchool System, Cal. Const., art. IX, §§ 5, 6, 14; \n  231.  Pursuant to such authority, the State approves, incorporates, and organizes the \nformation of local school districts, Cal. Const., art IX, § 14; § 35500 et seq.; \n  232.  The local school districts' governing boards, in all pertinent matters, function as \n \n \n \n  39 \n\nagents of the principal, the State; \n  233.  The State controls the ability of its agents to hire the Plaintiffs by way of its \nCBEST requirement and its credentialing process, §§ 44252, 44250 et seq., 44830(a); \n  234.  The State presides over a state-funded school finance system in which the State \nprovides, on average, over two-thirds (approximately 69%) of the total revenues of local \nschool districts; \n  235.  On average, approximately 82% of a California public school district's general \nfund expenditures are used to pay employee salaries and benefits; \n  236.  The State Legislature has full power to prescribe the terms of employment for \nteachers and other certificated positions in the public schools; \n  237.  Moreover, local district employment contracts with certificated personnel are \nexpressly subordinate to the State Legislature's control and power to terminate them without \nany impairment of contract § 44851; \n  238.  Whereas the State delegates its authority to fix and order paid the compensation of \ncertificated personnel to local school districts, § 45022, it continues to impose directly several \nrestrictions on the level of compensation, including a minimum limitation on the salary paid to \npublic school teachers, Cal. Const., art. IX, § 6; a mandate that local districts expend the \nmajority of their current expense of education for teacher salaries, § 41372; and the \nrequirement that salary schedules shall be uniform within districts for public school teaching \npositions based on a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience, § 45028; \n  239.  Beyond compensation, the State has decided the classifications of credentials, § \n44256, and has specified in often elaborate detail the specific job duties that may accompany \neach credential, §§ 44258-44258.7; \n \n \n \n  40 \n\n  240.  The State also, inter alia, regulates the period of the local school district \nemployment contract, § 44929.20, the conditions of permanent status, §§ 44929.21, 44929.22, \n44929.23, the possibility or requirement for leaves of absence and personal leaves, § 44963 et \nseq., the grounds for dismissal, § 44932, and the conditions for renewal of certification to \nremain employed, §§ 44277, 44270.1; \n  241.  The State, through its Commission on Teacher Credentialing, can suspend or \nrevoke the credentials of public school employees for failure to fulfill a valid local district \nemployment contract without good cause, § 44420; \n  242.  The State, through its Commission on Teacher Credentialing, can suspend or \nrevoke the credentials of public school employees for any other improper conduct during \nemployment or evident unfitness for service, § 44421; \n  243.  The State, through its Commission on Teacher Credentialing, is intimately \ninvolved not only with the initial granting of public school teaching credentials, but also with \nthe ongoing support, assessment, credentialing, and employment of certificated public school \npersonnel, § 44225 et seq., § 44279.2 et seq., § 44490 et seq.; \n  244.  The State provides for and regulates collective bargaining between the State and \nState employees on issues of wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, \nCal. Gov't. Code § 3512, pursuant to which laws \"State employees\" expressly include \"the \nteaching staff of schools under the jurisdiction of the State Department of Education or the \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction,\" Cal. Gov't Code § 3513(c); \n  245.  The State has established and administers the State Teacher's Retirement System, \n§ 22001, for the retirement of California public school teachers, under which system the State \ndetermines the level of benefits, §§ 22211, 23800 et seq., 24000-24407.5, and the various \n \n \n \n  41 \n\ncontribution rates, §§ 22804, 23400, 23400.1, 23402, 23412, 23413, and into which system the \nState makes contributions separate and above that contributed by local school districts; and \n  246.  The State, through the State Board of Education and the State Department of \nEducation and by direct mandate, establishes textbooks, Cal. Const., art. IX, § 7.5, curriculum, \ne.g., §§ 51210, 51220, 51220.1, 51221, 51222, 51226 and graduation requirements, § 51225.3, \nadministers assessments of students, and otherwise significantly controls the daily classroom \ndelivery of educational services. \n  247.  Based on the totality of facts, the State and local school districts comprise a series \nof integrated educational enterprises with interrelated operations, common management, \ncentralized control of labor relations, and common constitutional and statutory authority for \ngovernance; \n  248.  Based on the totality of facts, the State and local school districts concurrently exert \nsignificant control over the public school positions which Plaintiffs seek, sharing or \ncodetermining those matters which govern the essential terms and conditions of employment; \n  249.  Defendant CTC is an \"employer\" of the aggrieved Plaintiff class of public school \ncredential applicants within the meaning of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as amended, \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., in that the Defendant CTC regularly employs fifteen or more \npersons and has acted and continues to act as an \"agent\" of the employer, Defendant STATE \nOF CALIFORNIA, in its development and administration of the CBEST and its denial of \npublic school credentials to the Plaintiff class. \n  250.  Defendant CTC is itself, independently, an \"employer\" of the aggrieved Plaintiff \nclass of public school credential applicants within the meaning of Title VII of the 1964 Civil \nRights Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., in that the Defendant CTC regularly \n \n \n \n  42 \n\nemploys fifteen or more persons and has interfered with the Plaintiffs' ability to obtain \nemployment with local public school districts by way of its development and administration of \nthe CBEST, § 44252.5, and its refusal to grant public school credentials to the Plaintiff class, § \n44250 et seq.; see also § 44225(m). \n \n  b.  Liability \n  251.  The Defendants practice of requiring Plaintiffs to pass the CBEST in order to \nobtain their credentials or to obtain reauthorization to work in certificated positions has \nprevented Plaintiffs from obtaining said credentials and certificated positions and, thereby, \nfrom securing the positions of employment in the Defendant State of California's schools for \nwhich they are otherwise qualified, together with all the rights and benefits attached thereto. \n  252.  This practice of the Defendants has a disparate impact on the Plaintiff class of \nAfrican American, Asian, and Latino applicants insofar as members of these racial minorities \ndisproportionately fail the CBEST vis-à-vis white applicants.  The CBEST, from its inception \nto the present, has had a disparate impact on racial minorities.  Whites have passed the CBEST \nat a rate of 80%, while the pass rates for African Americans, Latinos, and Asians have been \nonly 35%, 51%, and 59%, respectively. \n  253.  Defendants' use of the CBEST is not justified by any business necessity as neither \nthe overall test content nor the test's particular passing scores have ever been validated as job-\nrelated in accordance with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedure and \nprevailing professional standards. \n  254.  Moreover, alternative, less discriminatory measures exist by which the Defendants \ncan ensure that Plaintiffs possess the requisite, job-related levels of reading, writing, and math \n \n \n \n  43 \n\nskills.  Defendants' failure to adopt any of these measures, regardless of the test's validity, itself \nviolates Title VII. \n  255.  Defendants' discriminatory actions against Plaintiffs, as alleged above, constitute \nunlawful discrimination in employment on the basis of race, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2. \n  256.  As a proximate result of the Defendants' discriminatory actions against Plaintiffs, \nas alleged above, Plaintiffs have been harmed insofar as they have been prevented from \nobtaining public school credentials and certificated positions, and, thereby, from securing \nemployment in the public schools for which they are otherwise fully qualified. \n  257.  Because the credentials and certificated positions sought by Plaintiffs cannot be \nsecured absent injunctive relief, no adequate remedy exists at law for the injuries suffered by \nPlaintiffs herein.  If this Court does not grant injunctive relief of the type and for the purpose \nset forth in the Prayer for Relief below, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury in that they will \nbe unable to obtain employment in the one common Public School System in positions for \nwhich they have expended substantial time, money, and energy preparing for and for which \nthey are otherwise fully qualified. \n \n \n  COUNT II:  TITLE VI \n  258.  The Defendants are subject to suit under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as \namended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq., insofar as they control or themselves represent a \"program \nor activity\" within the meaning of the Act. \n  259.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis further allege, that the \n \n \n \n  44 \n\nDefendant STATE OF CALIFORNIA receives federal financial assistance for the operation of \nits Public School System through the State Department of Education, which assistance is \nthereupon distributed by the State Department of Education to local school districts. \n  260.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis further allege, that the \nDefendant CTC receives federal financial assistance. \n  261.  Defendants have instituted, developed, and administered the CBEST as part of the \nState credentialing process through which the Defendants determine and administer the \nminimum standards for obtaining public school credential positions. \n  262.  The Defendants' practice of requiring Plaintiffs to pass the CBEST in order to \nobtain their credentials or to obtain reauthorization to work in certificated positions has \nprevented Plaintiffs from obtaining said credentials and certificated positions for which they \nare otherwise fully qualified, together with all the rights and benefits attached thereto. \n  263.  This practice of the Defendants has a disparate impact on the Plaintiff class of \nAfrican American, Asian, and Latino applicants insofar as members of these racial minorities \ndisproportionately fail the CBEST vis-à-vis white credential applicants.  The CBEST, from its \ninception to the present, has had a disparate impact on racial minorities.  Whites have passed \nthe CBEST at a rate of 80%, while the pass rates for African Americans, Latinos, and Asians \nhave been only 35%, 51%, and 59%, respectively. \n  264.  Defendants' use of the CBEST is not justified by any educational necessity as \nneither the overall test content nor the test's particular passing scores have ever been validated \nas job-related in accordance with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedure \nand prevailing professional standards. \n  265.  Moreover, alternative, less discriminatory measures exist by which the Defendants \n \n \n \n  45 \n\ncan ensure Plaintiffs possess the requisite, job-related levels of reading, writing, and math \nskills.  Defendants' failure to adopt any of these measures, regardless of the test's validity, itself \nviolates Title VI. \n  266.  Defendants' discriminatory actions against Plaintiffs, as alleged in Count II, \nconstitute unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et \nseq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder. \n  267.  As a proximate result of the Defendants' discriminatory actions against Plaintiffs, \nas alleged in Count II, Plaintiffs have been harmed insofar as they have been prevented from \nobtaining public school credentials and authorization to work in certificated positions from the \nDefendants, and, thereby, from participating in the Public School System in a manner for \nwhich they are otherwise fully qualified. \n  268.  Because the credentials and certificated positions sought by Plaintiffs cannot be \nsecured absent injunctive relief, no adequate remedy exists at law for the injuries suffered by \nPlaintiffs herein.  If this Court does not grant injunctive relief of the type and for the purpose \nset forth in the Prayer for Relief below, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury in that they will \nbe unable to obtain positions in the one common Public School System for which they have \nexpended substantial time, money, and energy preparing for and for which they are otherwise \nfully qualified. \n \n \n  COUNT III:  42 U.S.C. § 1988 \n  269.  Plaintiffs refer to Paragraphs 258 to 268, inclusive, of Count II above and \nincorporate them herein by reference. \n \n \n \n  46 \n\n  270.  In discriminating against Plaintiffs under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as \namended, Defendants have violated the Plaintiffs' civil rights and are liable for the attorneys' \nfees and experts' fees incurred in vindicating said rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \n \n \n \n  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows: \n  1.  For injunctive relief prohibiting the Defendants from denying any of the individual \nPlaintiffs, members of the Plaintiff organizations, or members of the Plaintiff class a California \npublic school credential or authorization to teach in a California public school certificated \nposition due to California Basic Educational Skills Test results; \n  2.  For reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and \n42 U.S.C. § 1988; \n  3.  For the costs of the suit herein incurred; and \n  4.  For such other relief as the Plaintiffs are entitled and the Court deems proper.   \n \n \n \nDated:                                                \n          Attorneys for Plaintiffs \n          ARMANDO M.

Jurisdiction of the subject matter of this action was established \n5  in the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  § 1331  and § 1343  and 42 U.S.C.  § \n6  2000e-5(t)(3).  First Amended Complaint, Docket No.  (\"DKT#\") 13.1 \n7  Plaintiffs appeal from a final judgment of the district court, pursuant \n8  to FRCP 58, finding for Defendants on both counts and entering judgment in \n9  favor of Defendants.  Opinion and Order, DKT# 417 (\"Op. &  Ord. \"); \n10  Judgment, DKT # 418.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' appeal \n11  pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  § 1291. \n12  A timely appeal was taken by Plaintiffs within the thirty days \n13  permitted by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (\"FRAP\") 4(a)(1).  Judgment \n14  was entered on September 23,  1996, Judgment, DKT# 418; the appeal was filed \n15  on October 16,  1996.  Notice of Appeal, DKT# 432. \n16 \n17  STATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED \n18  I.  Whether the initial attempt to  \"validate\" the CBEST--which utterly \n19  failed to undertake a job analysis that identified any elements of work behavior \n20  and which was therefore unable to determine that the CBEST is  \"predictive of \n21 \nDocuments from the record are cited by their district court Docket \n22  1 \nNumber and tabbed in the Excerpts of Record accordingly.  Trial Exhibits are \ncited herein and tabbed in the Excerpts by their trial exhibit number. \n23 \n1 \n24 \n\n\\ \n1  or significantly correlated\" with elements of work behavior--was a \n2  professionally acceptable method for employment test validation. \n3  II.  Whether the Defendants' decision to attempt validation of the CBEST \n4  for one  \"generic\" position complies with the requirement under Title VI and \n5  Title VII that a test which disproportionately impacts minorities be job-related \n6  for each position the test selects for. \n7  III.  Whether the CBEST test items have ever been shown by \n8  professionally acceptable methods for employment test validation to actually \n9  measure the basic skills they purport to when Defendants have never offered \n10  any evidence of such a relationship as required by law and when the only study \n11  undertaken by Defendants in this regard demonstrated a failure of CBEST items \n12  to measure the skills they purport to. \n13  IV.  Whether the revised CBEST satisfies the requirements of Title VI \n14  and Title VII that the specific skills tested be limited to the  \"important or \n15  critical\" reading, writing, and math skills needed by educators when Defendants \n16  retained many skills on the CBEST which were determined to be less than \n17  important. \n18  V.  Whether the passing standard for the CBEST writing sub-test is job-\n19  related when the only passing score study ever performed on the writing sub-\n20  test demonstrated that 9 or lO--not 12--out of 16 distinguishes between \n21  educators who do and do not  \"write well enough to teach\". \n22 \n23 \n2 \n24 \n\n1  VI.  Whether the district court complied with the requirements of FRE \n2  706 mandating an expert report and cross-examination for court-appointed \n3  experts when it appointed and used an apparently biased court-appointed expert \n4  without requiring any report or permitting cross-examination. \nS \n6  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n7  This action is a civil rights class action challenge to the California \n8  Basic Educational Skills Test (\"CBEST\"), one of the exams required for \n9  obtaining a credential to teach, counsel, or administer in the public schools of \n10  California.  Plaintiffs include eight individual educators and the largest Latino \n11  and Asian-dedicated educator organizations in California and one of the largest \n12  such African American organizations, the Association of Mexican American \n13  Educators, the California Association for Asian-Pacific Bilingual Education, and \n14  the Oakland Alliance of Black Educators (collectively,  \"Plaintiffs\"  or \n15  \"Educators \").  The district court certified the case as a class action on behalf of \n16  all Latino, African American, and Asian educators adversely affected by the \n17  CBEST, Op.  and Ord. at 6,  DKT# 417, a class now conservatively estimated to \n18  number over 50,000 educators of color.  See Class Cert. Order, DKT# 132 at \n19  10:20-23.  Defendants are the State of California and the California \n20  Commission on Teacher Credentialing (collectively,  \"Defendants\" or \"CTC\"). \n21  Plaintiffs claim that the CBEST has a disproportionate adverse \n22  impact on Plaintiff class members seeking jobs in the public schools without \n23 \n3 \n24 \n\n1  being properly  \"job-related\" to those positions as required by Titles VI and VII. \n2  Following trial, the district court ruled for Defendants on both counts.  The \n3  court ruled that,  although the CBEST does adversely impact each of the three \n4  ethnic groups in the Plaintiff class, Defendants had met their burden of \n5  establishing the test's job-relatedness through a series of validation studies, all \n6  of which the court found  to be professionally acceptable.  The court also ruled \n7  that Plaintiffs had failed  to prove the existence of less discriminatory, \n8  substantially equivalent alternatives.  See Op.  and Ord., DKT# 417. \n9  Plaintiffs,  in pursuing this appeal, contend the district court \n10  committed several legal errors in its validity determinations.  Instead of \n11  requiring that Defendants meet the demanding showing necessary to establish \n12  the job-relatedness of the CBEST, the district court based its decision on what it \n13  took to be the \"self evident\"  facial validity of the test.  Justifying a test which \n14  adversely impacts so many on the basis of its appearance as  \"easy\" or \n15  \"relevant\" are the types of simplistic notions that Title VII prohibits.  The \n16  requirement that tests with adverse impact like the CBEST be validated as job-\n17  related is especially appropriate where, as here, a single test is used to limit \n18  employment opportunities for not just one, but for a broad array of jobs. \n19  Plaintiffs challenge the court's validity determinations with respect to \n20  both the original CBEST, first implemented in 1983, and to the  \"revised\" \n21  CBEST which Defendants implemented in 1995, on the eve of trial and after \n22  post-litigation studies pointed to infirmities in the test.  Even should this Court \n23 \n4 \n24 \n\n1  uphold the  \"revised\" CBEST, the lack of validity for the original exam \n2  nonetheless warrants a finding  that it was unlawful and a remand for a \n3  determination of appropriate relief.  Plaintiffs contend,  however, that many of \n4  the problems with the CBEST's validity--the lack of validation for each position \n5  at issue, the lack of validity as to the items, the failure to test for only critical \n6  or important skills, and the invalid passing standard on the writing test--have \n7  carried over to the revised CBEST.  Accordingly, both tests are unlawful. \n8 \n9  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n10  This Court reviews the five  validity issues raised by Plaintiffs de \n11  novo.  All five issues involve mixed questions of law and fact.  The Supreme \n12  Court has defined mixed questions as those in which \"the historical facts are \n13  admitted or established, the rule of law is undisputed,  and the issue is  whether \n14  the facts satisfy the [relevant] statutory standard, or to put it another way, \n15  whether the rule of law as applied to the established facts is or is not violated. \" \n16  Pullman-Standard v.  Swint, 456 U.S. 273,289 n.19 (1982).  In U.S.  v. \n17  McConney, 728 F.2d 1195 (9th Cir.  1984), this Court determined, en bane, the \n18  process for determining the standard of review involving such mixed questions. \n19  \"If application of the rule of law to the facts  requires an inquiry that is \n20  'essentially factual,' ... the district court's determination should be classified as \n21  one of fact reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard.\"  Id.  at 1202.  Yet: \n22  If, on the other hand,  the question requires us to consider legal \nconcepts in the mix of fact and law and to exercise judgment about \n23 \n5 \n24 \n\n\\ \n1  the values that animate legal principles, then ... the  question should be \nclassified as one of law and reviewed de novo. \n2 \nId.  Most mixed questions will be reviewed de novo the Court acknowledged, \n3 \n\"because usually the application of law to fact will require the consideration of \n4 \nlegal concepts and involve the exercise of judgment about the values underlying \n5 \nlegal principles.\"  Id. \n6 \nThe Pullman-Standard case was a Title VII disparate treatment case. \n7 \nThere, the Supreme Court found that the state-of-mind determination required \n8 \nto discern the intent to discriminate is  \"essentially factual\"  in nature,  indeed, \n9 \nthat it \"appears ... to be a pure question of fact\".  Pullman-Standard v.  Swint, \n10 \n456 U.S.  at 288, 289.  The instant disparate impact case involves, however, a \n11 \n\"legal concept\" of discrimination, see id..  That is, whether Defendants can \n12 \njustify their use of the adversely impacting CBEST exam through a sufficient \n13 \nshowing of \"business necessity\" and  \"job-related[ness]\" .  42 U.S.c. § 2000e-\n14 \n2(k)(I)(A).  By definition,  the resolution of this question will involve  \"the \n15 \nconsideration of legal concepts and ... the exercise of judgment about the values \n16 \nunderlying legal principles.\"  McConney, 728 F.2d at 1202.  See also Bratt v. \n17 \nCounty of Los Angeles, 912 F.2d 1066,  1072 (9th Cir.  1990).2 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n2  Plaintiffs do not claim, and this Court need not determine, that all issues \n21 \narising from a Title VII or Title VI disparate impact claim require de novo \nreview.  The issues raised herein, however, all concern matters in which the \n22 \nfacts have been established below and where all that remains is  for this Court to \nexercise its independent legal judgment in applying the law to these facts. \n23 \n6 \n24 \n\n\\ \n1  FACTS \n2  I.  THE CBEST HAS HAD A  \"RECURRING ... SIGNIFICANT AND \nSYSTEMATIC\" ADVERSE IMPACT ON MINORITY TEACHERS \n3  & THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT POPULATION. \n4  Since February 1983, the California Basic Educational Skills Test \n5  (\"CBEST\") has been required for almost all of California's certificated teaching \n6  and non-teaching positions in the public schools.  Cal.  Educ.  Code § 44252(b) \n7  (West's 1993 & Supp.  1997); id.  § 44830(b).3  Teaching positions for which \n8  the State has required the CBEST include that of elementary school (or \n9  \"multiple subjects \") teachers, §§ 44259, 44256, and secondary school (or \n10  \"single subjects\") teachers in the areas of Agriculture, Art, Business, English, \n11  foreign languages, Health Science, Home Economics, Industrial and \n12  Technology Education, Mathematics, Music, Physical Education, Science, and \n13  Social Sciences.  §§ 44259, 44256, 44257.  Non-teaching positions for which \n14  the State has required the CBEST include administrators,  § 44270, school \n15  counselors (or \"pupil personnel services \"),  § 44266, librarians, § 44269, school \n16  nurses, § 44267.5, clinical or rehabilitative service personnel §44268,  and child \n17  center (e.g.,  pre-school) supervisors, § 8360.l. \n18  Since its inception, the CBEST has adversely impacted minority \n19  educations in a \"recurring, large, significant and systematic\" manner.  Exh. 573 \n20  at  12;  Op.  and Ord., DKT# 417 at 26-7.  Whites pass the CBEST at a rate of \n21 \n22 \nUnless otherwise noted, all subsequent code references are to the \n3 \nCalifornia Education Code). \n23 \n7 \n24 \n\n\\ \n1  80%, while African Americans, Latinos, and Asians pass at rates of 38%, \n2  49 %,  and 53 %,  respectively.  Exh. 573 at 12;  Op.  and Ord., DKT# 417 at 26-\n3  7.4  Throughout the CBEST's history, the CTC has repeatedly acknowledged \n4  the adverse impact of the test upon the Plaintiff class. See ~ Exh.  106 at 5, \n5  107 at 5,  111  at 4,  117 at 4,  122 at 77.  So have contractors and committees \n6  sponsored by the CTC.  Exh. 206 p.  6.9, 2.41, 4.20; Exh.  1855 at p.  ii. \n7  The adverse impact observed with respect to the CBEST is not a \n8  mirror of the impact typically observed on standardized educational and \n9  employment tests.  The degree of the CBEST's adverse impact on the math and \n10  reading subtests is  substantially greater than that observed on most such tests, at \n11  least as concerns African Americans and Mexican Americans.  Lefkowitz \n12  Direct at p.  12-16, Exh. 576A; Exh. 582; T.1878-1880. \n13  Though the CBEST is offered six times each year, Op. and Ord., \n14  DKT# 417 at 5, many educators of color who suffer a CBEST failure quickly \n15  elect to pursue career options other than public education.  According to a CTC \n16  study, among minorities who fail the CBEST a single time, 25%  of Latinos, \n17  41 % of Asians, and 48%  of African Americans do not return for further \n18  humiliation.  Exh.  116 at 6-7, 9.  Plaintiff Sam Genis (left public \nSee,~, \n19 \n20 \nThe district court's order contains a drafting error.

Plaintiffs' and Defendants' experts both agree, the White pass rate \nis 80%.

Op. and Ord., DKT# 417 at 5-6. \n3  With respect to test-takers of all races, the CBEST fails 45 % of \n4  incumbent teachers who take it, 25 % of California college graduates, 25 % of \n5  those holding Master's degrees, and 10% of the graduates of Stanford's \n6  prestigious School of Education.  Poggio Supp.  Dir., Exh. 576 at 45-46; \n7  Haertel Direct, Exh. 578 at 40: 14-41: 18;  Exh.  122 at 17-22.  Defendants have \n8  offered no empirical evidence that a widespread basic skills deficiency has ever \n9  existed among California public school teachers and/or graduates of California \n10  education programs on the order of magnitude suggested by CBEST failure \n11  rates.  T. 2569:5-2571:19, 2563:1-13; Wright Depo.  12/5/95 at 126:9-127:3; \n12  Haertel Dir., Exh. 578 at 40:24-45:12;  Poggio Supp.  Dir., Exh. 576 at 45;  see \n13  generally Exhs.  1850,  1973,  1641,  1970. \n14  During the years that the CBEST has been in place, the minority \n15  teaching force has largely remained static, with the percentage of African \n16  American teachers declining.  Exh. 570 at 1,  3.  At the same time,  the public \n17  school student body has moved from a majority white, to a \"majority minority\" \n18  composition.  Exh. 50 at 13.  Now nearly 60%  of the student population \n19  consists of ethnic minorities.  Id. at 2,  13.  See also Exhs. 48, 49, 51. \n20  Nationally,  according to the U.S.  Department of Education, \n21  California has more than 42 % of the country's Limited-English-Proficient \n22  (\"LEP\") students.  In California's public classrooms, nearly one out of three \n23 \n9 \n24 \n\n1  students come from a home where English is  not the primary language.  Jew \n2  Direct, Exh. 579 at 24:3-7.  Currently, there is  approximately 1 Spanish \n3  bilingual teacher for every 92 Spanish-speaking LEP students;  1 bilingual \n4  teacher for every 116 Cantonese LEP students;  1 bilingual teacher for every \n5  690 Vietnamese LEP students, and only 9 bilingual Hmong teachers to serve \n6  nearly 30,000 Hmong LEP students.  Exh. 51  at 6,  16. \n7  A  1991  report published by the State Department of Education cited \n8  the CBEST as one of the primary causes of the severe shortage of bilingual \n9  teachers (then estimated at 14,000).  Exh. 559 at 13,  19,27.  A CTC-\n10  commissioned study found the CBEST is  \"[t]he greatest barrier to increasing \n11  the number of underrepresented groups in teaching\".  Exh. 206 at 6.9. \n12 \n13  II.  THE CBEST READING AND WRITING TESTS ARE COLLEGE \nLEVEL. THE REVISED MATH TEST IS PRECOLLEGIATE. \n14 \nThe district court, referring only to math items on the recently \n15 \nrevised CBEST, concluded that the CBEST tests \"at most secondary-level, \n16 \nprecollege skills.\"  Op.  and Ord. at 11, DKT# 417.  The only evidence \n17 \nconcerning the other two sub-tests suggests otherwise. \n18 \nDefendants' expert performed a readability analysis which \n19 \ndemonstrated that the mean readability of the reading questions was at grade \n20 \nlevels 13.92 and 12.82 respectively, with some passages as high as the 20 to \n21 \n23rd grade level.  T.  1167:17-1170:17; Exh. 637 at A20415-A20416. \n22 \n23 \n10 \n24 \n\n1  The writing test is set at a level substantially higher than required for \n2  a college graduate who  \"writes well enough to teach\".  Exh.  120 at 20, and \n3  Table 20;  see infra Facts at § IX.  The fact that the math test should test only \n4  rudimentary math skills was found unremarkable and consistent with other job \n5  analyses for teacher jobs by Defendants' expert, Dr. Lundquist.  Exh.  1541  at \n6  312; T.  1081,  1095.5 \n7  Defendants and their contractors consistently have described the \n8  CBEST as  \"college-level\".  See,~, Exhs.  73  at 1;  125 at 12;  206 at 4.3.6 \n9 \n10  III.  A SHORT HISTORY OF THE CBEST AND ITS VALIDATION \n11  The CBEST was developed in 1982 by Educational Testing Service \n12  (\"ETS\"), pursuant to a contract with the State of California.  The first test was \n13  administered in December 1982.  The statutory requirement that credentials not \n14  be issued and that school districts not hire credential holders absent proof of \n15  CBEST passage took effect on February 1,  1983.  AMAE v.  State of \n16  California, 836 F.Supp.  1534,  1538-39 (N.D.Cal.  1993) at DKT# 51. \n17 \n18 \nIn one of the studies Defendants used as a model for their post-litigation \n19  5 \njob analysis, so few  math skills were considered relevant across the educator \nJobs revIewed that math was dropped entirely from that state's basic skills test. \n20 \nT. 1889:2-25, 978:22-980:4;  see also Exh.  13 at 2 (Senator Hart did not think \nmath should be at as high a level as reading and writing). \n21 \nWhen the CTC's CBEST program director took the CBEST himself, he \n22  6 \ndid not find the test \"too easy\", but rather \"reasonable and appropriate in terms \nof its level of difficulty.\"  T. 2604:19-24; Wright Depo. 4110/95 at 20:21-21:1. \n23 \n11 \n24 \n\n1  Prior to this litigation, Defendants undertook three validity studies, \n2  only two of which were advanced by the CTC as evidence of job-relatedness. \n3  The first effort was the 1982 validity study by Dr. Wheeler and Dr. Elias.  Op. \n4  and Ord. at 32, DKT# 417, Exh.  120.  The second was a 1985 study by Dr. \n5  Watkins.  Op.  and Ord. at 33, DKT# 417;  Exh.  118. \nb  Though the data was all gathered for a third CBEST validity study in \n7  1991  by CTC employee, Dr. Patricia Brinlee, the Commission never reported \n8  the results of this study and never published it in a complete and final  report. \n9  See Exh.  131; T. 576:24-582:9.7 \n10  After this litigation was initiated in 1992, Defendants retained Dr. \n11  Lundquist who performed the first job analysis vis-a-vis the CBEST in  1994 and \n12  1995 (Exh.  1541).  She later followed  this study with a content validation \n13  report in May of 1995 (Exh.  1543).  Op.  and Ord. at 33, DKT# 417. \n14  The results of Dr. Lundquist's work caused Defendants to \n15  significantly revise the CBEST for the first time.  Beginning with the August \n16  1995 test, algebra and geometry and similar \"hjgher order\" math questions were \n17  dropped.  Id.  at 5; Exh.  1543 at 7-2.  In all,  60%  of the old CBEST math \n18  items were found  inappropriate \"because they related to nonjob-related skills\". \n19 \n20 \nSix \"validity study sessions\" at six separate sites were intended to be \n21  7 \nconvened for this study, Exh.  131 at A2539, and the study documents reveal \nthat data were gathered from 112 individuals at six locations:  San Diego, Los \n22 \nAngeles, Riverside, Sacramento, Fresno, and the San Francisco Bay Area.  Id. \nat A2522-2524 (see  \"Study Loc\"). \n23 \n12 \n24 \n\n1  Op.  and Ord. at 44.  These items were supposedly removed from the revised \n2  CBEST.  Id.  at 44-45.8 \n3  In fact,  Dr. Lundquist's job analysis, which had gathered data from \n4  over 1,100 teachers, found that approximately 80 % of the CBEST math test \n5  was not job-related.9  Dr.  Lundquist determined that these results were \n6  consistent with other job analyses performed on teacher jobs in other states. \n7  Exh.  1541  at 312; T.  1081:3-22;  1094:12-1095:5.  After meeting with the \n8  CTC, however,  she decided to do additional work on the content of the math \n9  sub-test alone.  T.  1083:17-1084:13;  1086:8-1087:2.  This work, which was \n10  not part of her original validation proposal to the CTC, is  reflected in her \n11  content validation report.  T.  1087:3-1089:20;  1091: 12-1092: 11;  Exh.  1543; \n12  Exh.  187.  Nineteen math skills were endorsed by small, unrepresentative \n13  \"focus groups\", as part of this study.  Defendants retained these math skills on \n14  the CBEST, overriding the judgment of the  1,100 teachers whose data from the \n15  job analysis endorsed only 10 math skills.  Exh.  1543 at i-iv;  T.  1096:1-\n16  1098:23;  1105:18-1108:25;  1109:4-1110:2;  E~h. 631;  T.1117:23-1118:1O. \n17 \nBut see Poggio Sup.  Dir., Exh 576 p.29-32 (uncontradicted testimony \n18  8 \nthat 35 % of the items on the revised test do not match the revised specificatIOns \nusing Dr. Lundquist's system for matching CBEST items to the revIsed \n19 \nspecIfications) . \n20 \nDr. Lundquist admitted that less than 14 of 40 items on CBEST test \n9 \nforms  she had examined would match her Job Analysis specifications and that \n21 \nshe had never specifically determined the exact number. T.  1156:9-25.  Dr. \nPoggio's unrebutted analysis, using ETS's item classification, showed that only \n22 \n6-7 out of 40 math items can be classified as job-related under the Job \nAnalysis.  Poggio Dir., Exh.  575 at 22:16-23:7. \n23 \n13 \n24 \n\n1  Though Dr. Lundquist also substantially revised the CBEST test \n2  specifications for reading and writing, compare Exh.  138 (original \n3  specifications) with Exh.  1543 at 4-9 to 4-20 (revised specifications), \n4  Defendants did not change the content of the reading and writing tests in any \n5  way.  The same reading items and the same writing prompts written for the \n6  prior test specifications are being used on the revised CBEST.  Id.  at v, 4-23; \n7  see also Op.  and Ord., DKT# 417 at 44:5-7. \n8  Although all test-takers--including minorities--performed better on the \n9  revised math test, Defendants increased the standard required to pass the \n10  revised math sub-test from 26 to 29 out of 40.  Raising the math passing score \n11  to 29 resulted in essentially the same pass rates for all ethnic groups as were \n12  observed with the original CBEST.  Employing the original passing score of 26 \n13  on the revised test would have decreased the CBEST's adverse impact on the \n14  Plaintiff class.  Poggio Supp.  Direct (on Adverse Impact) at 1,  3, Exh.  574; \n15  Poggio Sup.  Dir., Exh. 576 at n.32, Exh. 541. \n16 \nIV.  THE STATE REJECTED MAKIN6 THE CBEST JOB-RELATED \nAT THE OUTSET. \n17 \n18  The original CBEST test specifications were not developed from job \n19  analyses of teaching and non-teaching positions but were written by  a \n20  politically-appointed\" Advisory Board\" as mandated by the CBEST legislation. \n21  Exh. 32 at 5-8;  see specifications at Exh.  138.  At the very first Advisory \n22 \n23 \n14 \n24 \n\n1  Board meeting, the State official primarily responsible for implementing the \n2  CBEST legislation, instructed the Board in drafting the specifications that: \n3  The purr.ose of the test is to ensure a reasonable 'foundation' of \nbasic skills for all teachers; the skills will not necessarily be job-\n4  related per se. \n5  Exh.  13  at 3.  (emphasis in the original). \n6  In fact,  the State considered and explicitly rejected performing a job \n7  analysis and making the CBEST job-related in 1982.  T. 254: 13-259:2, 267: 10-\n8  16;  Exhs. 20 at 2;  19 at 1, 2,  4;  13 at 3;  24 at 9953  (T.  270-71);  25 at 1 (T. \n9  271-72);  26 (T.  272-73);  31  at 10016-18 (T.  267-70); 23 at 12-13,  15  (T.  273); \n10  27  (T.  273-80);  36 at 1 (T.  286-90); 35 at 2;  179 at 4;  14 at 4.  This decision \n11  was at least in part motivated by an awareness of the impending adverse impact \n12  of the CBEST and the desire of ETS and the State to insulate themselves from \n13  Title VII liability under the mantle of \"licensing\".  T. 254:13-259:2; 267:10-16; \n14  Exh.  19 at 1, 2, 4;  T. 278:4-6.  Defendants elected to live with the  \"licensing\" \n15  rationale despite being told by ETS, by a private education attorney, and by \n16  their own staff that the CBEST was likely sub3~ct to job-relatedness standards. \n17  Watkins Depo.  4/17/95 at 92: 13-96: 16;  Exh.  19 at 1, 3;  Exh.  14 at 4.10 \n18 \nMoreover, one of the significant reasons for the selection of ETS as \n19  10 \nCBEST contractor was its ability to meet the  \"extremely short timeline for the \nfirst administration\" of the CBEST.  Exh. 22 at 3; Exh. 32 at 9.  Use of ETS's \n20 \npre-existing PPST exam, without the requisite a priori job analysis, was the \nonly option identified by the State for meeting the statutory deadline.  Id.;  T. \n21 \n282:3-285:25.  When first runner-up NES informed the State that a job analysis \nwas required, Exh. 31  at 10016-18, its bid was penalized as being  \"not \n22 \nrealistic\", as  \"[t]rying to do too much\", and as not \"fit[ting]  in [the]  time line. \" \nExh 27 at 9993-4, T.273:17-280:18. \n23 \n15 \n24 \n\n1  V.  DEFENDANTS FAILED TO VALIDATE THE CBEST AS JOB \nRELATED PRIOR TO LITIGATION. \n2 \nDr. Wheeler and Dr. Elias were not qualified to undertake the \n3 \nnecessary job analyses, nor to investigate the job-relatedness of any employment \n4 \ntest such as the CBEST.  They did not have the requisite educational or \n5 \nprofessional training, nor were they familiar with principles of employment \n6 \ntesting.  T.  96:5-98:4;  106:6-13; 368:13-369:22;  377:13-378:18. \n7 \nDr. Wheeler and Dr. Elias, as well as the CTC, admitted that they \n8 \nfailed  to undertake the necessary job analyses to content validate the CBEST for \n9 \nany job.  T.  106:14-25; 376:25-385:5; Wright Depo.  4/11/95 at 19:8-20:11.11 \n10 \nBecause they did not carry out job analyses, they did not identify a single \n11 \nimportant work behavior for any job.  T.  106:18-21; 381:4-11; 382:4-9. \n12 \nDr. Wheeler conceded at trial that their study did not comply with \n13 \nthe professionally accepted content validation standards in place at the time and \n14 \nthat she and Dr. Elias  \"did not represent the CBEST test as a content valid \n15 \ninstrument for the State of California,  as part of this study.\"  T. 376:25-385:5. \n16 \nIn carrying out the  1985 study, Dr:'Watkins also failed to undertake \n17 \nany job analyses.  Dr. Watkins was not qualified--indeed,  he admitted he did \n18 \nnot know how--to do a job analysis.  Watkins Depo. 4117/95  at 89:4-16, 90:21-\n19 \n20 \nDr. Wright is the FRCP 30(b)(6) representative for the CTC.  His \n21  11 \ndeposition testimony was submitted at tnal pursuant to FRCP 32(a)(2),  key \nportions of which are included in the excerpts at Tabs A, B, and D.  The cited \n22 \nportions of Dr. Wheeler's and Dr. Elias's testimony are also included in the \nExcerpts. \n23 \n16 \n24 \n\n1  91:17; 21:7-22:5, 42:25-46:22.12  Having failed to do any job analyses, Dr. \n2  Watkins conceded he too failed to identify any important work behaviors for \n3  any job.  ld. at 89:14-16; see also Wright Depo. 4111/95 at 43.13 \n4  Evidence questioning the CBEST's validity surfaced in the CTC's \n5  unpublished 1991  study.  Some of this evidence corresponded to the same \n6  concerns over the validity of the math test reflected in both Dr. Watkins earlier \n7  work and Dr. Lundquist's later work.  Dr. Brinlee testified that the results of \n8  the study suggested the following  \"global recommendations\": \n9  \"(1) that additional time should be given to examinees to take the \nCBEST; (2)  that the appropriateness of some of the skills tested \n10  should be reconsidered (e.g.,  algebra and geometry); and (3) that the \nsecond-Ianguage/bias-related issues be further investigated by experts \nin linguistics, testing, and related fields. \" \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \nKey portions of Dr. Watkins' deposition testimony was received by the \n17  12 \ntrial court fursuant to Fed.R.Civ.Proc.  32(a)(3)(B) and are included in the \nExcerpts  Record at Tab C. \n18  0 \nThough the lack of job analyses prevented the  1985 Study from \n19  13 \nconfirming the job-relatedness of the CBEST for any position,  it did produce \nsignificant evidence disconfirming the content validity of the CBEST.  Namely: \n20 \n(i)  a majority of panelists felt math skills were improperly weighted, over \nemphasIzing algebra and geometry and a near majority felt reaoing skills over \n21 \nemphasized logIcal as opposed to literal comprehension, Exh.  118 at 14, 27; \nand (ii) significant differences surfaced with respect to judgments about the \n22 \nrelevance of CBEST skills for different job categories; Poggio Dir., Exh. 575 \nat 18, Lefk. Dir., Exh. 576A at 60-64. \n23 \n17 \n24 \n\n- -- -- -\n~  -~------------\n1  Exh. 571  at 12th page. 14  Though he denied all knowledge, Dr. Brinlee \n2  testified these results were conveyed to Dr. Wright, her supervisor.  They were \n3  also conveyed to the Executive Director of the CTC, and to other staff,  id., \n4  though not to the public.  T. 576:24-582:9.  The district court completely \n5  ignored this significant disconfirming validity evidence in its review of the \n6  CBEST.  See generally Op.  and Ord. \n7 \n8  VI.  DEFENDANTS FAILED TO VALIDATE THE CBEST FOR \nEACH POSITION FOR WHICH IT IS  USED. \n9 \nDr. Wheeler and Dr. Elias, failed to gather information about the \n10 \nrelevance of the CBEST by grade level or subject matter taught.  T.  99:9-19; \n11 \nOp.  and Ord. at 34, DKT# 417, Exh.  120 at 6.  They also failed to gather any \n12 \ninformation regarding non-teaching positions.  T.  104:22-105:25, 379:10-\n13 \n380: 12.  Dr. Wheeler testified that the importance ratings gathered were all \n14 \nabout the generic \"job of teaching in California\", and that none of these ratings \n15 \nconcerned the relevance of the CBEST to nonteaching jobs.  As a result, Dr. \n16 \nWheeler testified, their study did not represent-that the CBEST was content \n17 \nvalid for nonteaching positions.  T. 379:3-380: 12. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \nDr. Brinlee, who is currently under a doctor's care, was allowed by the \n14 \ndistrict court to testify by interrogatory.  DKT# 366, Court Hearing, 5/15/96 at \n22 \n11-12; Dr. Brinlee testified that all of the data and documentation in Exh.  131 \nare accurate and authentic.  Exh. 571  at 3rd-11th page; see also Exh.  572. \n23 \n18 \n24 \n\n1  Dr. Watkins'  1985 study similarly asked all raters to judge the \n2  relevance of CBEST questions to a generic \"applicant for initial certification\". \n3  Exh.  118 at 55, 58.15 \n4  Dr. Lundquist did not perform a literature review of job analyses for \n5  nonteaching jobs.  Nor did she do separate job analyses for  non-teaching \n6  positions.  Exh.  1541.16  Instead, she asked a general group of nonteachers to \n7  rate skills generated by her job analysis of the generic teacher job.  ld.  at \n8  Appendix F (survey form for  \"administrators\" listing teacher job skills). 17 \n9  Dr. Lundquist did not (and because of small sample size, could not) \n10  do any subgroup analysis of job analysis data from  \"administrators\" (i.e., \n11  nonteachers).  As such, Dr. Lundquist did not examine the validity of the \n12  CBEST by job position for nonteachers (e.g.,  counselor, nurse, librarian, child \n13  center supervisors, principals, etc.).  T.  1073:7-1074:18. \n14 \n15 \n16 \nWhere Dr. Watkins asked judges to rate the relevance of broad CBEST \n15 \nskill categories to different types of positions, though flawed in many respects, \n17 \nsignificant differences surfaced as to how different Job categories view such \nskills.  Exh. 575 at 17-18; see also Exh. 576A at 60-64. \n18 \nAlthough Dr. Lundquist did not report it, the ETS Potter Study she \n19  16 \nreviewed found that differences existed between teacher jobs, warranting \nseparate job analyses.  T. 970:6-971:23, 974:9-976:19,  Exh.  1583 at 70, 79-80. \n20 \n21 \nNor were nonteaching positions analyzed as part of the additional \n17 \nvalidity investigations Dr. Lundquist undertook in her content validation report. \n22 \nExh.  1543 at ii-vii;  T.  1095:22-25. \n23 \n19 \n24 \n\n1  Dr. Lundquist did not examine proper passing scores for \n2  nonteachers, though there is some indication that a lower score for them might \n3  have been set.  T.  1173:14-1174:15;  1176:6-1177:9;  Exh.  1968, Table 14. \n4  To examine whether reading, writing, and math skills differ for \n5  separate teaching positions, Dr. Lundquist compared importance ratings for the \n6  various skills in her revised specifications by  \"credential categories\".  Yet,  Dr. \n7  Lundquist's  \"credential category\" analysis did not examine all the credential \n8  positions at issue, separately, but lumped several together.  Exh.  1541  at 131. \n9  (Her \"single subject\" category, for example, contains over 13  separate \n10  credential positions.  §§44259, 44256, 44257.) \n11 \n12  VII.  DEFENDANTS NEVER DEMONSTRATED THAT CBEST ITEMS \nARE VALID. \n13 \nAccording to even Defendants' expert, Dr. Mehrens, the items on a \n14 \ntest (i.e.,  the actual questions) must be \"validated\" by independent content \n15 \nexperts.  This means that there must be independent confirmation that the items \n16 \nmeasure what the test specifications call for.  Without this essential step a test \n17 \ncannot be said to be content valid.  T.  1475:14-1480:24; Exh.  1640 attached \n18 \narticle at 204, 208; Exh.  1632 at 43; Exh. 208 at 26 (Std 3.3).18  This is \n19 \n20 \n21 \n18  The item writers--i.e., Educational Testing Service (\"ETS\") or National \n22 \nEvaluation Systems (\"NES\"), the original and current CBEST contractors- \n!  should not be the judge of the match.  T.  1477:11-23. \n23 \n20 \n24 \n\n1  required by professional standards.  T.  1479.  See APA Standard 3.3, Exh 208; \n2  Uniform Guidelines §§  1607.14(C)(4),  1607.15C(5), Exh. 210. \n3  Defendants' expert, Dr. Mehrens, could not determine if CBEST \n4  items had ever been \"item validated\" in the  1982 ETS study,  the  1985 study, or \n5  in Dr. Lundquist's 1995 Job Analysis (Exh.  1541) and her  1995 Content \n6  Validation Report (Exh.  1543).  T.  1480:25-1482:17.  A review of these \n7  studies reviews no such process has ever occurred vis-a.-vis CBEST items.  See \n8  generally Exhs.  120,  118,  1541,  1543; Letk. Dir., Exh. 576A at 41:11-42:4. \n9  In fact,  although not disclosed in any of her reports, Dr. Lundquist's \n10  1995 validation work did have content experts attempt to match items to revised \n11  specifications--an attempt that failed,  as did an attempt by her own staff.  T. \n12  1146:21-1152:13. \n13  Thus, although Dr. Lundquist originally proposed to have content \n14  experts compare items on CBEST forms to the revised specifications, Exh.  187 \n15  at 33;  Exh.  1541  at xvi,  she never ultimately did so in either her job analysis or \n16  content validation report.  See generally Exh.,~.541; Exh.  1543.  Whenever \n17  assigning CBEST items to her revised specifications, Dr. Lundquist took ETS' \n18  item categorizations as a given and did not have content experts independently \n19  evaluate items either as to their fit with ETS's specifications or with her revised \n20  specifications.  T.  1143:17-1146:20. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n21 \n24 \n\n1  There is no evidence as to how ETS made their characterizations or \n2  of the qualifications of the characterizers  The one item an ETS  \"item \n.19 \n3  expert\" was asked to categorize at trial was said to belong in one of two \n4  specification categories (II.F.  or LB.),  neither of which corresponded to ETS's \n5  official categorization of that item (1.0.1).  T. 914:18-915:15;  Exh.  131  at \n6  A2422, A2399 (#19);  T. 933:2-12. \n7 \n8  VIII.  DEFENDANTS FAILED TO RETAIN ONLY IMPORTANT OR \nCRITICAL SKILLS ON THE REVISED CBEST \n9 \nCentral to the content validation process is the determination of \n10 \nwhich skills among the array of skills job incumbents are surveyed about shall \n11 \nbe retained for inclusion in the final test specifications.  The Uniform \n12 \nGuidelines and prevailing professional standards require that only  \"important\" \n13 \nor \"critical\" skills be part of employment tests.  Op. and Ord. at 47,  n.35. \n14 \nDr. Lundquist used a standard which selected for testing reading, \n15 \nwriting, and math skills that were rated as less than important by the educators \n16 \n{-\nshe surveyed.  Dr. Lundquist's importance scale rated skills as  \"Minor\" (a \n17 \nvalu'e of 1),  \"Important\" (2), or \"Critical\" (3).  She retained skills which had a \n18 \nmean or average importance rating of 1.5.  In her scale,  1.5 corresponds to the \n19 \nmid-point between minor and important. Exh. 624, T.  1032: 8-11. \n20 \n21 \nThere is also no documentation regarding the process of item \n19 \ncategorization under the new contractor, NES, or information about who is \n22 \nmakmg such item classifications or their qualifications.  Dr. Lundquist's input \nwas limited to a single phone call.  T.  1266:19-1267:14. \n23 \n~ \n! \n22 \n24 \nJ \n\n1  Dr. Lundquist originally intended to use a mean 2.0 importance \n2  retention criteria when she proposed to content validate the CBEST.  Exh.  187 \n3  at 32, T. 1029:23-1032:7. \n4  Dr. Lundquist's  \"less than important\" threshold is lower than that \n5  deemed professionally acceptable by ETS in the Rosenfeld and Tannebaum \n6  study, a model teacher basic skills study cited by Dr. Lundquist, (Exh. 216 at \n7  iii-iv,  T.  1032:12-1033:2;  1065:16-1066:18) or by the CTC itself in its content \n8  validation of the MSA T, the subject matter certification exam for California \n9  elementary school teachers.  Exh.  126 at p.  15.  Had a 2.0 retention criteria \n10  been used, only 6 math (not 10) and 28 reading (not 37), and 22 writing \n11  (instead of 27) skills would have been retained based on the Job Analysis data. \n12  T.  1058:3-24; Exh.  1541  at Appendix O. \n13 \n14  IX.  THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF A VALID PASSING SCORE FOR \nTHE WRITING SUB-TEST SUPPORTS A PASSING STANDARD \n15  OF 9 OR 10,  NOT 12, OUT OF 16. \n16  The CBEST writing sub-test consist~~of two essays, each of which \n17  are scored by two graders.  Each grader gives the essay a score ranging from \n18  zero to four points.  See Op.  and Ord. at 56, DKT# 417; DKT# 228, Wright \n19  Declaration (7/25/95) at 3.  Thus, the maximum points allowable on the writing \n20  sub-test is  16.  Since the CBEST's inception,  Defendants have required 12 out \n21  of 16 to pass.  Id. \n22 \n23 \n23 \n24 \n\n1  The only evidence advanced by Defendants to justify a 12 on the \n2  writing test is Appendix F to Exh.  120 (the  \"Burbank letter\"),  which briefly \n3  reports a recommendation from  \"44 carefully-selected\" readers.  The \"vote\" of \n4  the readers based on scale definitions is not a professionally acceptable passing \n5  score study.  See generally, Exh. 211  (ETS publication listing professionally \nacceptable passing score methodologies); T.  1488:4-15. \n6 \n7  The only passing score study ever performed on the writing test was \n8  done by Dr. Wheeler in  1982 with the same 44 readers.  (Dr.  Lundquist did not \nstudy the writing passing standard.)  Poggio Dir., Exh. 576 at 4-5 & n.3;  see \n9 \nalso T.  1171:6-1172:15;  1521:8-11.  These individuals made judgments about \n10 \nessays without knowing what score they had been assigned.  T.361:12-19; \n11 \nExh . .120 at  14-15, 20-21.  As with reading and math,  the study was intended \n12 \nto establish a borderline performance standard.  T. 387:4-6;  113:13-114:5. \n13 \n14 ._  The data gathered by Dr. Wheeler shows that borderline performance \n15  between \"writes well enough to teach\"  and  \"does not write well enough to \n16  teach\"  is  at a score of 9.  Exh.  120 at 20, Tab~f- 20 (A544).  Her data can be \n17  analyzed two ways.  Under a Borderline-Groups methodology, her \"Not \n18  Certain\" category represents a group of scores for borderline test-takers.  Their \n19  median or mean performance is a 9.  Exh. 211  at 34; Exh.  120 at Table 20,  see \n20  also T. 397:2-11; and T. at 493:2-11  (CTC rounds cutscores down).20  Under \n.21 \n22 \n20  Dr. Poggio has used this exact same methodology to set passing scores \non writing tests  Kansas.

THE COURT APPOINTED AN APPARENTLY BIASED \nEXPERT, THEN DENIED PLAINTIFFS THE OPPORTUNITY TO \nDISCERN HIS OPINIONS AND BIASES. \n11 \n12  ~  As trial commenced, the district judge announced that the desire to \n13  appoint a \"court-appointed expert\" to assist the court with the technical issues in \n14  the case.  See T.  388:3-11.  In order to procure an expert first,  the court \n15  delayed the  \"expert\" phase of the trial until June 1996. \n16  The district judge ultimately annou!'~~ed he intended to appoint Dr. \n17  Stephen Klein of the Rand Corporation.  Id.  The court permitted the parties to \n18  propound interrogatories to Dr. Klein but struck and/or refused to require Dr. \n19  Klein to respond to certain interrogatories seeking to ascertain potential bias.21 \n20 \nAmong the interrogatories stricken were questions as to the nature of \n21  21 \nDr. Klein's personal and professional relationships with individuals employed \nby Defendant CTC, and the approximate time spent and remuneration received \n22 \nby Dr. Klein each year pursumg his substantial private consulting practice for \nstate licensing and certification boards (15 % of which is for California boards \n23 \n25 \n24 \n\n1  The court forbade all objections to the completeness of Dr. Klein's response. \n2  5/8/96 Hearing Tr. at 6:22-24,  DKT# 362.22 \n3  Plaintiffs objected to the appointment of Dr. Klein.23 \n4  The court denied these objections and appointed Dr. Klein  \"as the court's \n5  expert\", informing Plaintiffs that \"you will have an opportunity to examine him \n6  fully with respect to any views that he may have.\"  5/15/96 Hearing Tr. at \n7  3:24-4:7, DKT# 366 (emphasis added).  The court added: \n8  I expect to do it the way I've done it in the past.  At some point, \nprobably toward the end of the trial, I'll put on Dr. Klein and ask \nhim his views with respect to certain matters that have come up \n9 \nduring the trial, and he will eXQ..ound them, and then he will be \n10  vigorously cross-examined by LPlaintiffs'  counsel] and [Defendants' \ncounsel] and that will be the extent of what he does. \n11 \nId.  at 21: 16-22:4.  On the first day of trial, the court issued an order formally \n12 \nsetting forth Dr. Klein's duties and informing the parties that \"[i]f the Court \n13 \ncalls him as a witness, he will be available to the parties for such examination \n14 \n15 \nand agencies including Defendant CTC).  Id.;  see Plaintiffs Interrogatories, \nDKT# 356 at Nos.  3 and 10; compare with Dr.- Klein's Response at 5-7. \n16 \n. \nUpon compiling the Excerpts of Record Plaintiffs learned for the first \n17  22 \ntime that the district court did not make Dr. Klein's Response to Interrogatories \npart of the record.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have filed a motion with their brief \n18 \nseeking to supplement the record. \n19 \nPlaintiffs objected to Dr. Klein because:  (1) he has worked closely in \n23 \nthe recent past with. the Defendant CTC, including Dr. Wright, (2) he has \n20 \ndeveloped a substantial private consulting practice in support of certification \nexams with several state licensing boards mcluding many in California, (3) he \n21 \nhas already taken positions on issues raised in the case and in support of \ncertification exams like the CBEST, and (4) he has worked closely and \n22 \nextensively with one of Defendants' key experts, Dr. Mehrens.

The \n2  court required that the parties split Dr. Klein's hourly fee.  Id. \n3  The district judge never required Dr. Klein to provide the parties \n4  with a report detailing either Dr. Klein's opinions or the substance of his ex \n5  parte discussions with the court.  At the end of trial, the court reversed his \n6  earlier pronouncements and informed the parties for the first time that they \n7  would not be allowed to cross-examine Dr. Klein to discover the substance of \n8  his opinions or his potential biases or for any other purpose.  T. 2062: 14-22. \n9 \n10  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMEl\\l'f \n11  Plaintiffs include California's major minority educator organizations. \n12  These Educators and the class they represent are dedicated to improving the \n13  quality of teachers who will effectively educate minority and non-minority \n14  children alike.  Plaintiffs abhor the notion of teachers in the classroom \n15  committing spelling and grammatical errors and any suggestion to the contrary \n16  is both demeaning and inSUlting.  This case tur,!1s,  though, not on whether one \n17  values a quality public education, but on the value of the CBEST itself.  As \n18  presently constituted, the CBEST does not tell us which teacher candidates are \n19  truly likely to commit errors in basic skills that will undermine our schools. \n20  This is  so because the test continues to suffer from a lack of validity and job-\n21  relatedness for all the diverse positions for which it screens. \n22 \n23 \n27 \n24 \n\n1  While the effectiveness of the CBEST is undoubtedly a critical issue \n2  for our schools, there is a related, and equally critical public policy at stake \n3  here.  This policy--which Congress recognized in  1964 and  1991  in passing and \n4  amending the Civil Rights Act--seeks to ensure that arbitrary barriers are not \n5  erected which disproportionately interfere with minority access to employment \n6  opportunities.  Griggs v.  Duke Power Co., 401  U.S. 424, 432 (1971).  Given \n7  the widely-acknowledged and crucial need to integrate California's public \n8  school teaching force,  the CBEST is appropriately scrutinized and scrutinized \n9  closely.  Where the test fails to comport with professional and legal standards, \n10  it must not be allowed to continue to operate without appropriate modification. \n11  It is by now well-established that, where an employment or \n12  educational practice causes an adverse impact, Plaintiffs prevail under Title VII \n13  or Title VI unless Defendants can justify the disparate effect by proving the \n14  practice is job-related and consistent with business or educational necessity. \n15  Griggs v.  Duke Power Co, 401  U.S.  424, 432 (1971);  42 U.S.C.  § 2000e-\n16  2(k)(1)(A)(i);  Guardians Ass'n v.  Civil Servic\"!

Riles, 793 F.2d 969, \n19  982 n.9 (9th Cir.  1984), amended, (9th Cir.  1986).24  In determining whether \n20 \n21 \n24  As this Court acknowledged in Larry P. and as the Supreme Court \nimplied in Guardians, the standards and burdens of proof under Title VI and \n22 \nTitle VII for purposes of this case are the same.  See also Groves v.  Alabama \nState Bd.  of Educ., 776 F.Supp.  1518,  1530 (M.D. Ala.  1991). \n23 \n28 \n24 \n\n-~~~~~---- ---- ---\n1  the CBEST complies with professional and legal standards for establishing job-\n2  relatedness, one cannot rely on \"face validity\"  as the district court did so often \n3  below.  (\"The CBEST is self-evidently ... \";  \" ... the skills ... appear to be central \n4  to teacher competence. \";  \"The very nature of the CBEST makes evident its \n5  applicability ... \").  Op.  and Ord. at 12, 47, 48.  Reliance on an \"'obvious', but \n6  unmeasured\" belief in job relatedness does not establish job-relatedness or \n7  business necessity.  Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433  U.S.  321, 331  (1977);  Craig v. \n8  County~of Los Angeles, 626 F.2d 659, 667 n.  8 (9th Cir.  1980), cert. denied, \n9  450 U.S. 919 (1981).  Instead, it is essential that selection devices be \n10  'validated' by professionally acceptable methods.  Albemarle Paper Co. v. \n11  Moody, 422 U.S.  405,431 (1975); Blake v.  City of Los Angeles, 595 F.2d \n12  1367,  1378 (9th Cir.  1978). \n13  With references to Plato, Henry Adams, the Tax Court, and a \n14  dissenting Washington state appellate opinion, Op.  and Ord. at 9-11,  the district \n15  court below evinces the extent to which it was lured by the CBEST's appealing \n16  \"face\" validity. 25  Though well-intentioned, rn~.ny of the determinations the \n17  district court made in seeking to uphold the CBEST past, present, and future, \n18  will seriously undermine well-established employment testing precedent should \n19  this Court allow them to stand and will not ultimately serve our schools well. \n20 \nAs a result, the court effectively placed an inappropriate Ward's Cove \n21  25 \nburden on Plaintiffs,  requiring merely that Defendants produce an explanation \nfor a given validity rationale and placing on Plaintiffs the burden to persuade \n22 \notherwise.  See Ward's Cove Packing Co. v.  Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989);  see \n42 U.S.C.  § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A) (overturning Ward's Cove). \n23 \n29 \n24 \n\n--------\n---\n- ------ -\n1  The professionally acceptable and legally required steps for content \n2  validating a teacher test that has an adverse impact are well-established and \n3  were not in serious dispute below.  They are: \n4  (1)  Develop an original list of \"competencies\" or \"work \nbehaviors\" --that is, specific job skills considered necessary for \n5  successful job performance--by studying the job; this can \ninvolve a lIterature review, job observations and interviews, \nand work with a committee of experts; \n6 \n7  (2)  Conduct a job analysis survey to determine the appropriate \nfinal  list of work behaviors; typically this involves asking a \n8  representative sample of current job incumbents about the skills \nthey consider necessary to successfully perform their job; \n9 \n(3)  Determine the test domain or specifications, that is, the \n10  blueprint for the test, based on the work behaviors identified \nand endorsed through the job analysis;26 \n11 \n(4)  Have item-writers who are content experts (e.g.,  in reading, \n12  writing, or math) write test questions which wIll measure the \nskills called for by the test specifications; \n13 \n(5)  \"Validate\" the items that have been written, that is, confirm \n14  that they actually measure the skills they purport to by having \nindependent content experts review the items to determine what \n15  they assess; and finally \n16  (6)  Determine by professionally :,:..~eptable methods the appropriate \npassing score(s) for the test which will be \"reasonable and \n17  consistent\" with normal expectations for a minimally competent \neducator. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n26  A \"Job Analysis\" in the global sense is typically understood to include \nall of the first three steps.  Exh.  1541  (Defendants' Job Analysis); \n21  See~, \nSlOP Principles, Exh. 207 at 21  ~C.  Thou~h a test, like the CBEST, need not \ninclude everything that is done on the job,  the investigator should describe the \n22  I \nwhole job as part of the job analysis,  mdicate what is  mcluded in the [test] \ndomain and explain why certain parts were or were not included.\"  Id.  at 20. \n23 \n30 \n24 \n\n1  See Uniform Guidelines, §§  1607. 14(C)(1)-(4),  1607.6(H), Exh. 210 (attached \n2  in Addendum pursuant to Circuit Rule 28-2.7); Exh.  1640 attached article by \n3  Defendants' expert at 197, 204-209. \n4  Plaintiffs focus here on five  issues with respect to the district court's \n5  rulings which conflict with these requirements.  This Court reviews the trial \n6  court's determinations on these issues de novo.  See Standard of Review, supra. \n7  Plaintiffs first challenge the pre-litigation validity studies.  These \n8  studies did not follow the steps outlined above at all.  Rather, they merely \n9  asked panels of teachers whether CBEST test questions appeared relevant to \n10  their jobs.  Importantly, neither the test questions nor the test specifications \n11  were developed pursuant to the requisite job analysis, which requires, inter \n12  alia, an identification of critical or important work behaviors.  The failure to \n13  follow the required procedures resulted in a non-job-related CBEST, as best \n14  reflected from Defendants own evidence.  When they finally carried out a job \n15  analysis as a result of this litigation, at a minimum,  60-80 % of the CBEST \n16  math test was determined to be invalid and no~:=:job-related.  As such, even if \n17  this Court goes no further, the original CBEST must be declared unlawful and \n18  this cause remanded for the appropriate relief. \n19  Secondly, Plaintiffs argue it was legal error for the court below to \n20  approve the use of a single test across an unprecedented array of different jobs \n21  when that test had not been validated as job-related for each \"position in \n22  question\" as required by Title VII.  The CTC is entitled to use a single test \n23 \n31 \n24 \n\n1  such as the CBEST for twenty different job positions as it currently does only if \n2  it analyzes each job separately and separately demonstrates job-relatedness. \n3  Defendants lumped as many as thirteen different teaching jobs into a single \n4  category for analyzing the CBEST's job-relatedness.  Defendants have never \n5  adequately studied the CBEST's job-relatedness for nonteaching positions. \n6  Thirdly, in fourteen years of CBEST operation, Defendants have \n7  never carried out the crucial \"item validation\"  step (No.5, above).  The district \n8  court completely ignored all evidence on this point.  Defendants never offered \n9  any evidence that CBEST items actually measure the skills they purport to as \n10  required by law.  The only work undertaken by Defendants in this area \n11  demonstrated that the CBEST lacks item validity. \n12  Fourthly, Plaintiffs argue that Dr.  Lundquist's standard for including \n13  skills on the revised CBEST was unlawfully low.  According to the Uniform \n14  Guidelines and professional testing standards, only skills that are deemed \n15  important or critical to successful job performance are to be retained for testing. \n16  Dr. Lundquist kept many skills which were ra~e.d as less than important. \n17  Fifthly,  Plaintiffs challenge the job-relatedness of the passing score \n18  on the CBEST writing test.  This issue and the evidence around it was ignored \n19  by the district court.  The only professionally acceptable study ever carried out \n20  on the CBEST writing sub-test evidences the appropriate passing standard as 9 \n21  or 10, not 12 out of 16. \n22 \n23 \n32 \n24 \n\n1  The Educators raise one final  issue for the Court.  During trial, the \n2  district judge appointed a court expert to assist him with the technical issues in \n3  deciding the case.  The expert was, in Plaintiffs' view, seriously biased in favor \n4  of Defendants.  The court committed legal error, in direct violation of Federal \n5  Rule of Evidence 706(a), by not requiring that its expert submit a report of his \n6  determinations and in not permitting Plaintiffs to cross-examine the expert to \n7  determine the substance of,  basis for,  and any possible bias in his opinions. \n8  The procedural taint from this legal error warrants a remand should this Court \n9  not otherwise rule for Plaintiffs on the validity issues raised. \n10 \nARGUMENT \n11 \n12  I.  IT WAS LEGAL ERROR FOR THE DISTRICT COURT TO \nUPHOLD THE ORIGINAL CBEST WHERE NO JOB \n13  ANAL YSIS WAS PERFORMED; ABSENT IDENTIFICATION \nOF WORK BEHAVIORS  THE CTC COULD NOT VERIFY \n14  THAT THE ORIGINAL CBEST \"CORRELATED WITH\" ANY, \nMUCH LESS ONLY \"IMPORTANT\" WORK BEHAVIORS. \n15 \nThe record reflects that the State chose not to undertake a job \n16 \nanalysis of any educator job when the CBEST\\vas implemented.  See Facts § \n17 \nIV., supra.  All three psychometricians responsible for the  1982 and  1985 \n18 \nstudies testified that they did not undertake job analyses, and as such,  that they \n19 \ncould not and did not identify any work behaviors or job duties for any job. \n20 \nSee Facts § V., supra.  Dr. Wheeler ultimately conceded that the  1982 study \n21 \ncould not and did not represent that the CBEST was content valid.  Id. \n22 \n23 \n33 \n24 \n\n1  In determining whether the original or revised CBEST meets the \n2  legal requirements of Titles VI and VII for jOb-relatedness, this Court looks to \n3  industry standards as embodied in the Federal Uniform Guidelines on Employee \n4  Selection Procedure (\"Uniform Guidelines\"), 29 C.F.R.  § 1607 et seq., Exh. \n5  210;27 the  1987 SlOP Principles, Exh. 207, and the  1985 APA Standards, \n28 \n6 - Exh.208.

The  1974 APA \n2  Standards provide that: \nWhen a test is represented as having content validity for a job or \n3 \nclass of jobs, the evidence of validity should include a complete \n4  descriptIOn of job duties,  including relative frequency,  importance, \nand skill level of such duties.  Essential. \n5 \nExh. 209 at Standard E12A (emphasis added).  The 1980 Principles state that: \n6 \nJob analysis is essential to the development of a content oriented \n7  procedure ....

[or  in the case of] \n8  work behavior analysis ... behavior statement[s}. .. . \n9  Exh. 650 at 4-5  (emphasis added).  All three sets of standards envision a \n10  systematic analysis of the job, producing a set of work behaviors, job duties or \n11  tasks specific to the job being analyzed.  By the authors own admissions, \n12  however, neither the  1982 nor the  1985 CBEST studies complied with these \n13  essential job analytic requirements. \n14  Similarly, the courts at the time of the-pre-litigation studies required \n15  (and require still today) a thorough analysis of the job, including an \n16  identification of important work behaviors spe;~fic to the job.29 \n17 \nOfficers for Justice v.

New York State Dept. of Civil Service, 909 F.Supp. \n185,  190 (S.D.N.Y.  1 95). \n13 \n14 \n-Not only is the court's selective reading of the  1980 Principles in error. \n30 \nsee citations supra,  but it bears noting that for this radical rewriting of \n15 \nemployment testing standards, the court relied on testimony from Dr. Mehrens, \n16- see Mehrens Direct, Exh.  1969 at 23,  19-20.  Dr. Mehrens is  not an expert in \nindustrial organizational psycholog)' (employnlent testing) or the standaras that \npertain to that field,  sucli as the  1980 PrInciples.  Moreover, he has limited \n17 \nemployment-related validation experience.  T.  1432:2-1432:15.  Dr. Mehrens is \nDefendants' expert in educationaf testing.  Defendants' employment testing \n18 \nexpert, Dr. Lundquist, offered no such mterpretation of the  1980 Principles. \n19 \nThe same Uniform Guidelines were in effect in the early 1980's that are \n31 \nin effect today.

When Defendants finally undertook a job analysis after the litigation \n4  was commenced, it found that a significant portion of the math exam tested \n5  \"non-job-related skills\".  Op.  and Ord. at 44, DKT# 41733 \n6  All the pre-litigation studies attempted was to ask panels of educators \n7  whether particular CBEST questions seemed relevant to the generic \"job of \n8  teaching\".  Op.  and Ord. at 34, 36, DKT# 417; Exhs.  118,  120.34  Absent the \n9  correlation of the test content with specific elements of work behaviors required \n10  for specific teaching and non-teaching jobs, the State's pre-litigation validity \n11  studies do no more than demonstrate that in the opinion of numerous California \n12  educators the skills and abilities measured by the CBEST are moderately \n13  relevant (not necessarily \"critical\" or \"important\" as required by the Guidelines) \n14  to some abstract notion of \"teaching\" as a whole.  This general opinion \n15  evidence, like the notion  \"facial validity\"  is insufficient to meet Defendants' \n16  burden of establishing job-relatedness.  DothaT':t v.  Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, \n17 \nThe district court's recent denial of all costs to Defendants appears to \n18  33 \nrecognize the fact that Plaintiffs established a violation of the Civil Rights Act \nvis-a.-vis the pre-litigation validation of the CBEST.  The court held that \n19 \n\"plaintiffs' case did have merit.  In 1995 ... defendants modified the CBEST \nexamination .... \"  Order 2112/97,  DKT# 444 at 3 (emphasis in original). \n20 \nDr. Watkins also asked whether the generic CBEST skills--like \n21  34 \n\"writing\" or \"logical comprehension\" related to the job of teaching.  Op.  and \nOrd. at 35.  This extra step did not cure the fundamental flaw flowing from a \n22 \nlack of a job analysis.  The CTC was still unable to establish that such generic \nskills correlated with any specifically identified work behavior for any job. \n23 \n38 \n24 \n\n1  331,97 S.Ct. 2720, 53  L.Ed.2d 786 (1977);  Blake v.  City of Los Angeles, 595 \n2  F.2d 1367, 1378 (9th Cir.  1979).  \"[O]pinion evidence that [certain skills or \n3  characteristics] are useful in [the job], does not prove job relatedness, but rather \n4  only a good faith belief of job relatedness.\"  Craig, 626 F.2d at 667 n.8 \n5  (citations omitted). \n6 \n7  II.  IT WAS LEGAL ERROR FOR THE DISTRICT COURT TO \nNOT REQIDRE DEFENDANTS TO DEMONSTRATE JOB \n8  RELATEDNESS FOR EACH TEACIDNG AND NON \nTEACIDNG POSITION FOR wmCH THE CBEST IS USED. \n9 \nSince its inception, Defendants have rested their claim for the \n10 \nCBEST's use as a screen for some twenty different job positions on evidence \n11 \naddressing the test's validity as a screen for a single generic teaching job.  See \n12 \nFacts § VI., supra. \n13 \nThe problem with this approach is that \"teaching\" is  not a single job. \n14 \nUnlike a bar exam which authorizes practice in any area of law, a credential \n15 \nauthorizes practice in a narrow specialization.  See Facts § I,  supra.  A holder \n16 \nof a Single Subject Math credential cannot tea2h English; an English credential \n17 \nholder cannot teach mUltiple subjects in an elementary classroom; a holder of a \n18 \nPupil Personnel Services Credential (school counselor) cannot serve as a vice \n19 \nprincipal, etc.  Each credential is a separate \"position\"  with separate job duties \n20 \nwithin the meaning of Title VII.  See 42 U .S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). \n21 \nPlaintiffs do not assert that \"basic skills\" in the abstract are not job \n22 \nrelated for some or even all of the jobs at issue.  Instead, the question raised \n23 \n39 \n24 \n\n1  here concerns whether all the specific reading, writing and math subskills the \n2  CBEST seeks to measure are related to specific reading, writing, and math \n3  tasks in all the different jobs.  It simply does not follow (and Dr. Lundquist's \n4  job analysis did not allow sufficient examination of this) that the same skills are \n5  required (or even relevant) for all  teaching or all non-teaching positions \n6  (counselors, librarians, school nurses, child center supervisors, administrators, \n7  etc.).  See~, notes  13 and 15, supra (teachers and nonteachers appear to \n8  have different views of the relevance of certain broad CBEST skills). \n9  A job analysis and evidence of job-relatedness is required for each \n10  job for which a test, such as the CBEST, selects candidates.  Title VII \n11  explicitly requires a demonstration of job-relatedness \"for the position in \n12  question\".  42 U.S.C.  § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i).  It would subvert the plain \n13  meaning of the Act to permit employers to avoid this requirement when using \n14  the same test for more than one position.  To the contrary, the Uniform \n15  Guidelines and the professional standards consistently make clear that for each \n16  use of a test as a screen for a job, the user m'~o:;t demonstrate the test's validity \n17  as to that job.  Uniform Guidelines, 29 C.F.R.  §§  1607.14(A) (\"Any validity \n18  study should be based upon a review of information about the job for which the \n19  [test] is to be used.  The review should include a job analysis ... \")  (emphasis \n20  added),  1607. 14(C)(2) ,  1607.15(C)(3), Exh. 210; SlOP Principles, Exh. 207 at \n21  20,21; APA Standards, Exh. 208 at  14 (1.6),  60-61, 61.  In particular, \n22  Standard 10.7 of the 1985 APA Standards makes clear that: \n23 \n40 \n24 \n\n1  If the validity of a test for selection into a particular job is based on \ncontent-related evidence, a similar inference should be made about \n2  the test in a new situation only if the critical job factors are \nsubstantially the same (as  is determined by a job analysis) ... \n3 \nId.  (emphasis added);  see also id.  at 64, Std.  11.1  Comment (\"Job analyses \n4 \nprovide the primary basis for defining the content domain.  If a single \n5 \nexamination is used in the licensure or certification of people employed in a \n6 \nvariety of settings and specializations, a number of jobs may need to be \n7 \nanalyzed. \")  The Defendants are entitled to use one test to select for so many \n8 \ndifferent job positions.  However, Title VII and professional testing standards \n9 \nrequire that they first study each job separately via separate job analyses. \n35 \n10 \nThe district court did not address the fact that Defendants' validation \n11 \nstudies, including Dr. Lundquist's, have never analyzed the CBEST vis-a-vis \n12 \nseparate teaching positions.  See Facts § VI., supra.36  The district court's \n13 \nconclusion that one or more separate job analyses were not in order for \n14 \nnonteaching jobs is a legal conclusion supported only by untested  \"face\" \n15 \nvalidity:  \"The very nature of the CBEST makes evident its applicability to \n16 \n17 \nIndeed, when Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Lefkowitz developed a battery of \n35 \ntests for different clerical jobs at Banker's Trust, he independently analyzed 35 \n18 \nseparate)ob  SiI?ilarly,  job analyses were warranted here. \nposi~ions.  s~parate \nT.  1608.20-1609.10,  1866.16-1867.16. \n19 \nDr. Lundquist did not do subgroup analysis by subject taught;  rather \n20  36 \nshe lumped all single subject teachers together, although she had sufficient \nsample sizes to look at some subjects.  T.  1058:25-1059:19;  1060:16-18; Exh. \n21 \n626.  (Nor did she do subgroup analysis by grade level taught, by geographic \nregion, or rural versus uroan, T.  1062: 16-1063:9,  although these factors were \n22 \nanalyzed in ETS' Rosenfeld and Tannebaum Job Analysis which Dr. Lundquist \nreferred to and relied.

Only after separate job analyses have \n7  been carried out enabling a psychometric confirmation of \"the critical job \n8  content\" of both jobs, can a user seek to employ a test for selection in a second \n9  job position.  Exh.  208,  1985 APA Standards at 10.7.  As set forth above,  no \n10  job analysis was carried out for  \"teachers\" until  1995; no job analysis has ever \n11  been carried out for any non-teaching position.38 \n12 \n13  III.  IT WAS LEGAL ERROR FOR THE DISTRICT COURT TO \nASSUME THAT THE CBEST l\\1EASURES WHAT IT \nPURPORTS TO WHEN DEFENDANTS HAVE NEVER MET \n14 \nTillS CRITICAL CONTENT VALIDATION BURDEN. \n15 \n16 \nThe court, in support, cites Dr. Elias' testimony that she believed \n17  37 \nCBEST skills were generally applicable to  nonteaching jobs.  Op.  and Ord.  at \n49,  DKT# 417.  Dr. Elias conceded this was a wholly untested assumption.  T. \n18 \n105:24-25. \n19 \nIn addition to the legal error, the district court's findings here are also \n38 \nclearly erroneous.  Wheeler and Elias admitted that nonteachers were not \n20 \nmaking judgments \"relevant to their jobs\" as the court claims.  Instead, \nnonteachers in 1982 were only making judgments about the relevance of \n21 \nCBEST items to the generic teacher job.  T.  104:22-105:25, 379:10-380:12. \nSimilarly, in Dr. Watkins'  1985 study,  nonteachers were not rating the \n22 \nrelevance of CBEST items to their jobs, but to a generic \"applicant for initial \ncertification\".  Exh.  118 at 55, 58. \n23 \n42 \n24 \n\n1  In fourteen years of operation, Defendants have never demonstrated \n2  the validity of CBEST items in terms of their ability to actually measure the \n3  specific reading, writing, and math skills called for by the test specifications. \n4  See Facts § VII., supra;  Post-Trial Proposed Findings of Fact,  DKT# 410 at \n5  Findings \"P49(b), 95, 97; Plaintiffs' Brief in Response to Court's Questions, \n6  DKT# 411  at 6. \n7  Even Defendant's expert, Dr. Mehrens, agrees that this is one of the \n8  key steps called for in content validation.  Id.; see also Summary of the \n9  Argument Section, supra, Step (5).  The Uniform Guidelines require, for \n10  example, that \"[fJor any [test] measuring a D skill, or ability the user should \n11  show that...the [test]  measures and is a representative sample of that D skill or \n12  ability\"  Uniform Guidelines § 1607. 14(C)(4);  see also § 1607.15C(5), Exh. \n13  210.  The 1985 Standards state that test specifications and test items should be \n14  sufficiently in sync  \"so that knowledgeable experts can judge the relations of \n15  items to the domains they represent.\"  Exh. 208 at 26,  Std.  3.3. \n16  In Contreras v.  City of Los Angele<:._656 F.2d 1267 (9th Cir.  1981), \n17  cert. denied, 451  U. S.  1021  (1982),  this Court approved a content validation \n18  procec!ure only where defendants had had \"experts individually reviewD each \n19  question and decideD if it tested one of the critical elements identified in the \n20  [job analysis] phase.\"  Id.  at 1282.  The Court determined that this \n21  \"examination review phase\" constituted the third part of the Craig test,  i.e.,  that \n22 \n23 \n43 \n24 \n\n--------~-------------------~-----\n1  \"the exam be significantly correlated with those elements of work behavior \n2  identified in the job-analysis phase.\"  Id. \n3  Here, the court again merely accepted the face validity of the CBEST \n4  when, without any evidence in support, it concluded that \"the CBEST has been \n5  shown to be a valid measure of [the]  basic skills [tested].\"  Op.  and Ord. at 51, \n6  DKT# 417;  see also id.  at 29.  To the contrary, the record demonstrates \n7  Defendants have never made this showing.  Dr. Lundquist attempted it twice, \n8  once with committees of content experts, once with her own staff.  Each time \n9  her efforts to validate CBEST items to actual CBEST skills failed,  as did the \n10  effort of one of ETS's item experts at trial.  See Facts § VII,  supra.39 \n11  Even if the old or the revised CBEST test specifications are \n12  acceptably job-related, Defendants must still show that the test itself is job-\n13  related.  Fourteen years after the test's substantial adverse impact began, there \n14  is only disconfirming evidence of the CBEST's ability to actually measure the \n15  skills called for.  It is significant to recall here that, other than the math test, \n16  Dr. Lundquist's work did not  \"change\" the a('~lal CBEST test content.  She \n17 \n18 \n39  The item \"accuracy\" review performed by panels of practici~ \neducators in the  1982 study, Exh.  120 at 6, Op. ana Ord. at 33, DKT# 417, \n19 \nwas not \"item validation\"  by content experts.  concerns whether the \n\"Accurac~\" \nquestion has the correct (and only one correct) answer.  It is not a review of \n20 \nwhether an item actually measures one of the sub-skills called for in the \nCBEST's specifications.  Moreover, as the Standards and Dr. Mehrens well \n21 \nrecognize, the rsychometric judgments involved in item validation are to be \nperformed by  content specialists\", e. g., university math and english \n22  I \nprofessors, not job incumbents.  Exh.  1640, attached article at 208; Exh. 208 at \nStd.  3.3. \n23 \n44 \n24 \n\n--- - ----\n--~-~~~-\n1  retained all CBEST reading items and writing prompts and filled in the \n2  eliminated portion of the math test with other pre-existing CBEST math items. \n3  Exh.  1543 at v, 4-23; see also Op. and Ord., DKT# 417 at 44:5-7.  To the \n4  extent the present CBEST items continue to be \"bad\" items, i.e.,  are vague, \n5  abstract, and not measuring concrete, specific job-related skills (written as they \n6  were to non-job-analytic test specifications), then all of Dr. Lundquist's efforts \n7  to validate the test by altering its surface specifications counts for little. \n8 \nIV.  IT WAS LEGAL ERROR FOR THE COURT TO PERMIT \nDEFENDANTS TO RETAIN CBEST SKILLS WHICH ARE \n9 \nNOT \"IMPORTA  NT ... FOR SUCCESSFUL [JOB] \n10  PERFORMANCE. \" \n11  The district court endorsed Dr. Lundquist's retention of several skills \n12  for testing on the CBEST that were judged by job incumbents in the job \n13  analysis to be  \"less than important\" (i. e., halfway between minor and \n14  important).  See Facts § VIII., supra;  Op.  and Ord. at 47, n.35, DKT# 417. \n15  The court found that Dr. Lundquist's 1.5 Mean Importance Rating/80% \n16  Applicable decision rules to be \"manifestly re~<;onable professional judgments\" \n17  Id.  The applicable standard is not whether Dr. Lundquist is being \n18  \"reasonable\", i.e., providing a rational basis for her decision-making.  Instead, \n19  the burden is on her to make professional judgments that will demonstrate the \n20  CBEST is manifestly job-related.  Griggs v.  Duke Power Co., 401  U.S. at 432. \n21  Dr. Lundquist's decision rules fail  to meet this challenge. \n22 \n23 \n45 \n24 \n\n1  Dr. Lundquist's use of a 1.5 mean importance rating is inconsistent \n2  with the Uniform Guidelines' requirement that only critical or important skills \n3  be selected for measurement.  29 C.F.R. § 1607. 14(C)(2).  See also SlOP \n4  Principles, Exh. 207 at 19 (A [test] may sample a given job performance \n5  domain, but if that domain is not an important part of the job, the value of the \n6  procedure for employment purposes in negligible. \");  1985 APA Standards, \n7  Exh. 208 at 61, 64.  The skills must be \"required\" for competent performance, \n8  not merely relevant to a job.  Id.  at 64. \n9  In fact,  where as here, the test in question does not measure the \n10  whole job, but only a few  critical or \"necessary prerequisite\" skills, then the \n11  content validity evidence must demonstrate that job incumbents actually \n12  consider those skills critical and not just \"relevant\" or even just somewhat \n13  \"important\".  See Uniform Guidelines, 29 C.F.R.  § 1607.14(C)(2), Exh. 210 \n14  (where test does not seek to measure work behaviors \"constituting most of the \n15  job\",  \"[t]he work behaviors selected for measurement should be critical work \n16  behavior(s)\").  See T.  1854:25-1857:2.  Indee1, the APA Standards also note \n17  the need to establish \"criticality\" under content validity when one is not \n18  attempting to represent the whole job.  Exh. 208 at 1.6; see also Exh. 207 at 22 \n19  (\"A Job Content Domain May be Restricted to Critical.. .or to \n20  Prerequisite ... Skills ... ).  Even Dr. Mehrens' writings concede that tests like the \n21  CBEST seek to measure the domain of \"critical knowledge and skills\", Exh. \n22 \n23 \n46 \n24 \n\n1  1640, attached article at 206, that is, those which are not merely important, but \n2  without which harm would be done to children.  Id. \n3  The district court's rationale that\" 1.5 rounds up to 2.0\", Op.  and \n4  Ord. at 47, n.35, DKT# 417, is hardly sufficient to rise to the level required by \nthese professional standards. \n5 \n6  Indeed, the primary study Dr. Lundquist relied upon in fashioning \n7  her job analysis, the ETS Rosenfeld and Tannebaum Job Analysis, used a \nhigher retention criterion (halfway between \"moderately important\"  and  \"very \n8 \nimportant\").  Exh. 216 at iii-iv.  Likewise, when the CTC validated one of its \n9 \n10  other primary teacher tests, the MSAT, it used essentially the same criterion as \nthe ETS study.  Exh.  125 at 15-16.  Yet, the best evidence that Dr. Lundquist \n11 \n12  herself considered a 2.0 Mean Importance standard the professionally \nappropriate standard for retaining CBEST skills is that she proposed using this \n13 \n14  very standard in her original validation proposal, Exh.  187 at 32, and she used \nit for her content validation report.  Exh.  1543 at iv. \n15  40  41 \n16 \nEven though Dr. Lundquist used a 2.0 standard in her content \n17  40 \nvalidation report on the way to retaining 19 math skills (instead of the  10 \nendorsed in the job analysis), the 2.0 issue still matters for the math skills as \n18 \nwell.  Dr. Lundquist's overriding the results of the job analysis based on data \nfrom over 1,100 educators with feedback from 20-odd member, \n19 \nunrepresentative focus groups should not be deemed lawful by this Court.  See \nAlbemarle Paper Co. v.  Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 433 n.32 (1975) (studies \n20 \nconducted \"at a time when the litigation was about to come to trial\"  and which \nare \"so closely controlled by an interested party in litigation must be examined \n21 \nwith great care. \").  Dr. Lundquist testified that she undertook not to investigate \nthe CBEST's vahdity, but--like an advocate--to  \"establish\" it with her studies. \n22 \nT. 939:9-940: 18.  The district court's approval of Dr. Lundquist's last minute \n\"second bite at the apple\", was rooted entirely in the face validity of the math \n23 \n47 \n24 \n\n1  The court also erred to the extent it considered the \"80 % Applicable\" \n2  endorsement criterion \"stringent\".  Applicable includes the category \"Minor\" as \n3  well as  \"Important\" or \"Critical\".  Exh. 624 at 2.  This contrasts with other \n4  studies that Dr. Lundquist looked at where not only was the importance rating \n5  higher, but the initial 80%  \"applicable\" screen did not include minor categories. \n6  See Rosenfeld and Tannebaum, Exh. 216 at iii-iv;  T.  1065:16-1066:18. \n7  Directly contrary to the district court's finding,  see Op. and Ord. at 47:6-8, \n8  DKT# 417, under Dr. Lundquist's weak standards, an item could be retained \n9  that was approved by less than 50 % of the judges as critical or important. \n42 \n10 \n11 \n12 \nskill descriptors (not even the particular items at issue):  \"this result seemed \n13 \nabsurd ... \";  \"some of the skills ... appear central to teacher competence\".  Op. \nand Ord. at 40, 47,  DKT# 417.  In fact,  the court improperly substituted its \n14 \nown opinion as to what should be on the CBEST in place of the  1,100 job \nincumbents, finding the job analysis results  \"questionable\", id.  at 46, even \n15 \nthough Dr. Lundquist herself reported them to be \"consistent with results of \nother recent teacher job analyses.\"  Exh.  1541  at 312.  Even using the weak \n16 \n1.5 retention standard from the job analYsis wOuld result in a very different \nmath test than that currently in place.  Exh.  1541  at xv.  In fact,  the 2.0 \n17 \nretention standard should be used to ensure that only those math skills which \nare actually critical to all jobs at issue are on the CBEST. \n18 \nThe Court, without any citation to the record, errs in stating that \n19  41 \nPlaintiffs' experts agree that a standard as low as 50%  important is acceptable. \nDr. Poggio's standard is more stringent than Dr. Lundquist's: he rates only \n20 \nentry or pre-requisite skills, and requires that a \"strong majorit)''' of the rating \nbe in.  top  (crucial and important) of the ratings.

THE DISTRICT COURT IGNORED THE RESULTS OF THE \nONLY PROFESSIONALLY ACCEPTABLE STUDY EVER \n2  CARRIED OUT ON THE CBEST WRITING SUB-TEST \nwmCH EVIDENCES THE JOB-RELATED PASSING \nST ANDARD IS 9 OR 10, NOT 12 OUT OF 16. \n3 \n4  Since its inception, the passing standard on the CBEST writing sub-\nS  test has been 12 out of 16.  This standard was derived from a \"vote\" of 44 \n6  essay readers in 1982 based on the four scale definitions (not pass, marginal not \n7  pass., marginal pass, pass), which is not a professionally acceptable method for \n8  setting passing scores.  The only professionally acceptable passing score study \n9  on the writing test--using the same 44 readers and a blind scoring system--\n10  empirically demonstrates that the proper, job-related passing score on the \n11  CBEST writing sub-test is 9 or 10.  There are large numbers of minority \n12  educators bunched around the writing cut score.  Altering that score downward \n13  would reduce the CBEST's adverse impact.  See Facts § IX., supra.43 \n14  As the district court recognized, even if the CBEST is a valid \n15  measure of writing skills, the test is unjustified under Titles VI and VII if the \n16  particular cut score \"is not itself a valid meaSl~e of the minimal ability \n17  necessary to become a competent teacher.\"  Op.  and Ord. at 52, DKT# 417, \n18  quoting Groves v.  Alabama State Bd. of Educ., 776 F.Supp.  1518,  1530 (M.D. \n19  Ala.  1991).  Indeed, in Groves, an arbitrary, politically established teacher test \n20 \n21 \nThe district court ignored this evidence and this issue despite the fact \n43 \nthat it was presented below.  See Post-Trial Proposed Findings of Fact and \n22 \nConclusions of Law, DKT# 410 at Findings ,P45(b); Plaintiffs'  Brief in \nResponse to Court's Questions, DKT# 41 I at 24. \n23 \n49 \n24 \n\n1  cut score was struck down as failing to meet the standard of being \n2  \"educationally justified\" under Title VI.  See also Richardson v.  Lamar Cty. \n3  Bd. of Ed., 729 F.Supp.  806, 819 (M.D. Ala.  1989), affd 935 F.2d 1240 \n4  (11th Cir.  1991); Rogers v.  Int'l Paper Co., 510 F.2d 1340 (8th Cir.  1975). \n5  Similarly, in the Guardians case, the Second Circuit noted: \n6  No matter how valid the exam, it is the cutoff score that ultimately \ndetermines whether a person passes or fails.  A cutoff score \n7  unrelated to job performance may well lead to the rejection of \napplicants who were fully capable of performing the job.  When a \n8  cutoff score unrelated to job performance produces dIsparate racial \nresults, Title VII is violated. \n9 \nGuardians Ass'n of New York City v.  Civil Serv., 630 F.2d 79,  105 (2nd Cir. \n10 \n1980), cert. denied 452 U.S. 940 (1981). \n11 \nTable 20 to the  1982 Elias and Wheeler report is shocking in its \n12 \nclarity: the line between \"writes well enough to teach\"  and  \"does not write well \n13 \nenough to teach\"  is 9 or 10.  This is  the line that demarcates  \"minimal ability to \n14 \nbecome a competent teacher\", see Groves, supra,  and the line which  \"relate[s] \n15 \nto job performance\", see Guardians, supra.  Regardless of what passing \n16 \nstandard the Burbank readers may have desir~d-to vote for or Superintendent \n17 \nHonig may have decided appeared reasonable to him,  any line above 9 or 10 is \n18 \nnot job-related, increases the test's adverse impact, and violates Titles VI and \n19 \nVII.  Id.; see also Uniform Guidelines, 29 C.F.R. § 1607.14(C)(4) (\"If a test \n20 \npurports to sample a work behavior. .. the manner and setting of the selection \n'i  21 \n22 \n23 \n50 \n24 \n\n---------\n1  procedure and its level and complexity should closely approximate the work \n2  situation. \")  (emphasis added).44 \n3 \n4  VI.  THE DISTRICT COURT FAILED TO COMPLY WITH FRE \n706'S REQUIREMENT OF AN EXPERT REPORT AND \nCROSS-EXAMINATION. \n5 \n6  Even if this Court is inclined to uphold the trial court's rulings, those \n7  determinations were procedurally tainted and must be remanded for a new trial. \n8  Plaintiffs believe a possible explanation for the district court's repeated reliance \n9  on the CBEST's face validity in contravention of well-established Title VII \n10  jurisprudence may be the result of the unreported influence of Dr. Klein.  We \n11  do not know the extent of Dr. Klein's ex parte communications with the court, \n12  nor the influence these communications had with the court, nor the extent to \n13  which extreme views and unfamiliarity with employment testing standards could \n14  have been tempered by the heat of cross-examination.  We know none of this \n15  because the district court did not require any report of the  \"advice\" he received \n16  from Dr. Klein and, most importantly, denied.J~laintiffs their right to cross-\n17  examine the court's expert.  See Facts § X., supra. \n18 \n19 \nThough the district court believed that the use of \"Dale\", an example of \n20  44 \na borderline teacher candidate, tended to depress the judges estimated \nperformance scores on reading and math as part of die  1982 Wheeler and Elias \n21 \nstudy, Op. and Ord., DKT# 417, at 56, Defendants were unable to establish \nthat Dale played any role in the writing passing score study (which took place \n22 \nat a separate time and place and with different judges than the reading/math \nstudy).  T. 361:3-8; see Exh.  120. \n23 \n51 \n24 \n\n1  The Federal Rules of Evidence (\"FRE\") make clear that,  with \n2  respect to court-appointed experts: \n3  A witness so appointed shall advise the parties of the witness' \nfindings,  if any .... The witness shall be subject to cross \n4  examination by each party, including a party calling the witness. \n5  FRE 706(a) (emphasis added).  In requiring no report from Dr. Klein,  nor \n6  allowing him to be cross-examined, the court committed legal error, tainting the \n7  entire ruling. \n8 \n9  CONCLUSION \n10  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this \n11  Court:  (1) adjudge the original CBEST unlawful and remand for appropriate \n12  retroactive relief; and (2) adjudge the revised CBEST unlawful and remand for \n13  appropriate relief; or, in the alternative, (3) if the Court is  not inclined to rule \n. \n14  in Plaintiffs' favor on the validity issues presented, then remand for a new trial \n15  based on the procedural taint underlying the court's rulings below. \n16 \n17  ATTORNEYS FEES & RELATED CASES \n18  Should Plaintiffs prevail on this appeal and the underlying action in \n19  any respect, Plaintiffs intend to seek costs and attorneys fees pursuant to 42 \n20  U.S.C.  § 2000e et seq. and 42 U.S.C.  § 1988.  Plaintiffs know of no other \n21  related cases pending before this Court. \n~-,   22  II \n23 \nf \n52 \n24 \n\ni\" ' \nDated in San Francisco, California, on the 7th day of March 1997. \nRespectfully submitted, \nPUBLIC ADVOCATES, INC. \nJOHN T.

Whether the District Court's interlocutory ruling that Title VI applies to \nDefendants should be reversed? \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA.  PROCEEDINGS AND DISPOSITION IN THE COURT BELOW \n- On September 23,  1992, Plaintiffs-Appellants initiated this action on \nbehalf of themselves and all others similarly situated by filing a Complaint in \nthe Northern District of California against Defendants the State of California \n(\"the State\") and the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (\"CTC\") \n(collectively  \"Defendants\").  (CRl).  On November 13,  1992, Plaintiffs served \nand  filed  their First Amended Complaint.  (CR13).  Defendants timely filed \ntheir Answer on December 3,  1992.  (CR15). \nPlaintiffs allege that the statutory requirement, passed by the State \nlegislature in  1980, which prohibits the CTC from  issuing a teaching credential \nto any person to teach in the California public schools unless that person \ndemonstrates proficiency in basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills in the \nEnglish language, and the CTC's subsequent implementation of the California \nBasic Educational Skills Test (\"CBEST\") pursuant to the legislation,  resulted in \nthe use of a discriminatory selection device in violation of Titles VI and VII. \nATL-2374S4 2  1 \n\n(CRI3).  The relief requested was limited to an injunction prohibiting \nDefendants from denying Plaintiffs or members of the class they sought to \nrepresent a credential to teach in  the California public schools based on CBEST \ntest results.  (CRI3). \nDefendants' Answer denied the substantive allegations of Plaintiffs' \nciaims and raised, ~ iilia, certain jurisdictioual defenses under both Title VI \nand Title VII.  (CRI5).  Since these defenses challenged Plaintiffs' right to \nproceed in court, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on \nDefendants' jurisdi;tional challenges. (CR23).  On August 25,  1993, the Court \ngranted Plaintiffs' motions for partial summary judgment holding that \nDefendants are subject to claims pursuant to both Title VI and Title VII. \n(CR51).  ~ AMAE v.  California, 836 F. Supp.  1534 (N.D. Cal.  1993). \nDefendants' motion for certification of the order for interlocutory appellate \nreview pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  § 1291  was denied.  (CR93). \nAfter a limited discovery period and oral argument on Plaintiffs' \nMotion for Class Certification, the Court certified the following class: \nAll Latinos,  African-Americans and Asians seeking California public \nschool credentials and certificated positions who are or will be \nadversely affected in their ability to obtain credentials and certificated \npositions by California Basic Educational Skills Test results. \n(CRI32).  Less than one month later, Plaintiffs moved to amend the class \ndefinition to  include a previously unstated claim for  \"~ackpay and frontpay \nrelief.  (CRI35).  The Court denied Defendants' motion to reopen discovery \nII \nand for an evidentiary hearing, and granted Plaintiffs' motion to amend the \nclass definition.  (CR142).  The Court bifurcated the proceedings, ruling that \n2 \nAT J...237484 2 \n\nStage I would address liability and Stage II,  if any, would address Plaintiffs' \nclaims for monetary relief. (kl.). \nAt the pre-trial conference, the Court decided that Stage I of the trial \nwould proceed in two phases -- Phase I for  the testimony of fact  witnesses and \nPhase II for testimony of expert witnesses.  Additionally,  the Court determined, \nfrom having reviewed the parties' written sabmissions,ll that it would need to \ndesignate a Court-appointed advisor for Phase II of the trial.  The Court heard \nfact witness testimony from February 5-7, on February 21  and March 8,  1996. \nOn JUD(  3,  1996, the Court designated Dr. Klein as its court \nappointed advisor. (CR375).  Phase II of the trial ran from June 3-20,  1996. \n-\nOn September 17,  1996,  the Court entered its Opinion and Order, holding that \n\"Defendants' requirement that Plaintiffs pass the CBEST in order to obtain \nemployment in the California public schools does not violate Plaintiffs'  rights \nunder Title VI or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" (CR417).  The \nCourt entered judgment in favor of Defendants. (CR418).  Plaintiffs did not file \nany post-judgment motions. \n1.1  Since this case was tried to the bench, the Court directed the parties to \nsubmit all expert witness direct testimony  writing.  These filings occurred \n10 \nprior to the status conference on February 1,  1996. \n3 \nAU·237484 2 \n\nB.  STATEMENT OF FACTSV \nThe CTC \nEffective January 1,  1971, based upon  the need for excellence in \nII \neducation,  the California Legislature adopted the Teacher Preparation and \nII \nLicensing Law of 1970 lito set broad minimum standards and guidelines fur \nteacher preparation and licensing.  (CR29at4).  This legislation created the \nII \nCommission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing (\"CTPL\") as a State agency \nresponsible for the development of standards and procedures for  the \ncertification of education professionals.  iliW In 1982, the Legislature changed \nthe name of the CTPL to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing)f \n(CR29atS). The CTC is composed of 15 voting members and 4\" officio \nmembers, the majority of which are current classroom teachers in California's \npublic schools, and includes current school administrators, school counselors, \nuniversity professors and representatives from the general public. \n(RT2!7 196at433). \nThe CTC's powers and duties include establishing standards for entry \ninto the education profession, reviewing and revising the code of ethics for the \nteaching profession, establishing sanctions for the misuse of a license, \naccrediting teacher preparation programs at public and private universities and \n'l../  Plaintiffs' opening brief devotes substantial attention to facts which are \nirrelevant to  the Issues presented.  Defendants cite the relevant facts here, and \nexpand on the facts  in the Argument Section as they relate to the issues \npresented. \n11  Defendants use the term CTC as a reference to the current Commission as \nwell as its predecessor, the CTPL. \nAT L-2J7484 2  4 \n\ncolleges, and encouraging professional growth and continuing education, Educ. \nCode §§ 44225(a),(c),(e)&(h),  442~7, 44277 & 44370.  Additionally,  the CTC \nis charged with disciplining licensees for professional misconduct and may \nslJspeod or revoke a credential for various reasons. Educ. Code § 44420. \nThe Basic Skills Lel:islation \nIn  1976, the Legislature passed AB3408, which requires the students \nin California's schools to pass an examination of basic reading, writing and \nmathematical skills to receive a high school diploma.  (RT217/96at417).  The \nparents of the school children responded that they favored basic skills testing of \nstudents, but the students were at a disadvantage because many of the classroom \nteachers and school administrators responsible for educating the children could \n, \nnot pass a basic skills examination themselves.  (RT217/96at418).  Accordingly, \nAssemblyman Gary Hart (\"Hart\") proposed legislation requiring every person \nseeking a credential as a teacher or administrator to demonstrate proficiency in \nbasic reading,  writing, and mathematics skills in  the English language by \npassing a state basic skills proficiency testY (CR29at4;7).  Hart introduced the \nlegislation in  response to the concerns expressed by the parents: \nIf one is going to be a role model for students and demonstrate what \nis good practice for students, you have to be able to exhibit those \nskills yourself, and the extent to which a teacher does not use good \ngrammar, writes notes home to parents with gross misspellings,  those \nkinds of things, I think send the wrong message not onry to the \n~/ Hart subsequently became a member of the State Senate and the Chair of the \nSenate Education Committee.  Hart presently' is the Director of the Institute for \nEducation Reform in the California State University System.  Prior to joining \nthe  Hart was a classroom teacher at Santa Barbara High School. \nle~islature, \n(RT217 /96at412-13;415). \n5 \nATL-237484 2 \n\n---------\n-- - - ---\nstudents but to the parents as well,  that the school system is not \nfunctioning properly.  (RT2I7/96at421). \nAt the time,  the teaching profession was the only profession in California which \ndid not have a licensing examination as a prerequisite for entry into  the \nprofession.  (RT217 /96at419). \nl\\doption and Implementation of the CBEST \nThe basic skills legislation became effective January 1,  1982, and the \ntest that eventually was developed is known as the CBEST.  Initially,  the \nCalifornia Department of Education (\"CDE\") was charged with development of \nthe CBEST.  The CDE accomplished this undertaking by selecting and \ncontracting with Educational Testing Service (\"ETS\") for technical assistance in \ntest development,  field  testing, and the initial validity study.  (CR29at9).  CDE \nselected ETS because: (1) the proposal received the highest quality rating from \nthe review panel; (2) proposed costs, per examinee, were lower than the costs \nproposed by other firms, and (3)  ETS' demonstrated experience in establishing \ntest centers and providing for administration of tests was considerably stronger \nthan that of the other firms.~'  (RT2/6/96at282-83;  PX22;32).  Pursuant to the \ncontract with the CDE, Drs. Wheeler and Elias of ETS directed the 1982 \nCBEST Validity Study, which involved a detailed job analysis of the positions \nat issue and a content validity study of CBEST test questions. (PX120).  As set \nforth below,  the State and ETS more than complied with the professionally \n'if  ETS administered the CBEST from December 1982 to June 30,  1995. \nBeginning July 1,  1995, National Evaluation Systems (\"NES\") succeeded ETS \nas the CBEST test contractor. \nATL-2J7484 2  6 \n\naccepted standards for validation in place at the time this CBEST study was \nconducted.  (RTII71  96at376-77). \nThe end result of this process produced a three-part test consisting of a \nreading section and  mathematics section, each containing 40 mUltiple choire \nquestions, and a writing section, which requires the test taker to write two \nessays.§!  On January 13,  1983, Superinter.dent Honig set the passing scores \non the CHEST at 70% correct for reading, 65%  correct for  math and a raw \nscore of 12 (on a scale from 4 to  16) on the writing.  (RTI/6/96at181;192; \nPX120atF). \nContinuin\" Validation of the CBEST \nIn  its ongoing review of the CBEST's validity,  the CTC commissioned \nthe 1985 Practitioners' Review, which also involved a detailed job analysis and \ncontent validity study of the CBEST.  Additionally,  using a widely-accepted \nstandard setting technique, the 1985 Practitioners' Review confirmed the \npassing score levels set by Honig.  Based upon the data collected, the 1985 \nPractitioners' Rev iew indicated that the passing score of 65 % correct on math \nwas somewhat low.  (PX118;DX1969at4O-41). \nIn  1994, the CTC retained Dr. Kathleen Lundquist to examine the job \nrelatedness of the CBEST.l!  Defendants also retained Dr. William Mehrens, \n§./  A sample of the test may be found  in the 1995-96 CBEST Registration \nBulletin, (DX1873),  attached in Defendants' Record Excerpts. \n21  In over 16 years' applied experience as an Industrial Psychologist,  Dr. \nLundquist has conducted or been responsible for approximately 100 validation \nstudies, most of which were content validation studies, and at least 20 criterion-\n(continued ... ) \nAT L-237484 2  7 \n\nwho is a nationally-known and respected psychometrician and educational \nmeasurement expert.~1  While not stated as an issue on appeal, Plaintiffs \nsuggest in their brief that Defendants' validation efforts were tainted in \nunspecified ways by the existence of this litigation.  This claim was readily \ndisposed of by the trial testimony of Plaintiffs' witness,  who admitted that tl1ere \nis no evidence to suggest, nor reason to  believe, that the existence of thi$ \nlitigation influenced the work done by Lundquist in this case. \n(RT6/11/96at1626).  If the existence of this litigation had any effect on the \nstudies, it resu1t,d in the application of overly stringent criteria to every \ndecision made along the way. \nLundquist began her investigation by undertaking a comprehensive job \nanalysis.  (DXI541).  Lundquist's job analysis project was conducted to \ninvestigate empirically the type and level of the reading, writing and math skills \nrequired for the K-12 positions in the public schools in California. \n(DXI967at7).  The study also examined whether the same set of basic skills \napplies to administrative and teaching support positions. (IdJ  These data were \nused to ascertain the extent to which the skills measured by the CBEST are \nsupported by current job analytic information.  This job analysis project \n1/(, .. continued) \nrelated validation studies.  The Court certified Dr. Lundquist as an expert at \ntrial.  (RT6/6/96atI274; 1293). \n'fi/  Among other distinctions, Dr. Mehrens served as President (1985-1986) of \nthe National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), as well as having \nbeen elected to and served on its Board of Directors.  The Court certified Dr. \nMehrens as an expert at trial.  (RT6/1O/96atI430). \nATL-2J7484 2  8 \n\nconsisted of four major research steps, culminating in the collection of ratings \nfrom a large statewide sample of teachers and administrators. \nUltimately, a survey was mailed to a sample of over 6000 teachers \nand over 1100 administrative and teacher support personnel in \nC~lifomia. \n(DX1967at15).  The return rate from this  mailing was approximately 20%  for \neach group.  (DX1541).  The data established that this group of respondents was \ndemographically representative of the relevant population, with the exception \nthat all  minority groups were overre.presented.  Plaintiffs agreed that the sample \nsize was sufficiently large for analysis and that overrepresentation of minorities \nwas appropriate.  (RT6/12/96at1772). \nAs discussed below, Lundquist used the survey results to identify \nimportant activities performed on the job.  In addition,  Lundquist analyzed the \nskills for subgroup differences by ethnicity, credential category and primary \nlanguage usage (i.e., 0%  versus 75-100% use of languages other than English \nin reading,  writing and total job activities).  (DX1541atTable5-21). \nWhile the job analysis confirmed the job-relatedness of virtually all \nreading and writing skills contained on the CBEST, relatively fewer math skills \nwere endorsed by a consensus of teachers and administrators as required for \nminimally effective job performance.  For math,  the findings of the job analysis \nsurvey were contrary to the collective experience of the CTC Commissioners \n(who are professional educators and other stakeholders with substantial \nexperience and expertise in the field  of education and educational \nmeasurement).  (RT6/6/96at1323-25;RT6/19/96at2552-53).  Given the counter \nintuitive nature and potential impact of the fmdings from the job analysis survey \nA'fL.237484 2  9 \n\non the proposed new CBEST test specifications, it was determined that a \nfollow-up  study should be conducted to ensure that the conclusions drawn from \nthis job analysis were reliable  unlikely to change in the near future. \n~ \nIn August 1995,  new forms  of the CREST were implemented, \nincluding a revised math test designed to  meet the new test specifications \nrecommended by Lundquist following the job analysis and content vaHdation \nstudy of the CBEST.  Defendants did not change the passing scores.  In \naddition,  the unrebutted evidence at trial established that the revisions to the \nmath sub-test had no effect on the overall passing rates of any ethnic group at \nissue.  (DX1966atl). \nThe  leyel of the CBEST \n~rade \nDefendants undertook a study to investigate the extent to which the \nknowledge, skills and abilities assessed by the CBEST are included in the \ncurriculum and  instructional materials utilized in California public schools \nwithin the seventh to twelfth grade levels.  The results of this project \ndemonstrate that none of the math skills on the CBEST is beyond a seventh \ngrade level,  (DX1972),  and none of the reading or writing skills beyond the \nhigh school level.  (DX1971).  Plaintiffs offered no evidence to the contrary. \nThe skills tapped by the CBEST are well within an appropriate range for K-to \n12 teacher candidates and are available to be learned by students afforded a fair \nopportunity in K-to-12 education. \nWheeler, who co-authored the  1982 CBEST validity study, testified \nthat she administered 80 CBEST math items to her son, who was in the third \ngrade at the time.  \"He finished in 45 minutes ... and  missed two items out of \n10 \nATL-237434 2 \n\n80 and he found printing errors on two items.\" (RT2I7/96at366-67).  Wright \nadministered the test to his then-ll-year-old triplets.  They answered all of the \nquestions correctly, and, after completing the test,  informed their father that it \nwas  \"easy.\" (DX1964at23).  Lefko\\llitz agreed that a review of sco!\"e \ndistributions indicates that the subtests on the CBEST are relatively easy. \n(RT6/1l/96atl666). \nThe  adverse impact of the CBEST \nalle~ed \nThe Court found that Plaintiffs met their burden of proving that the \nCBEST has an adverse impact on the Plaintiff class.  Plaintiffs obviously do not \ntake issue with this finding on appeal,  yet curiously devote a good portion of \ntheir appeal brief to the evidence of adverse impact presented.  Defendants \naddress the issue, briefly,  to correct factual  misstatements and to  respond to the \nwholly unsupported contention that the CBEST has resulted in a segregated \nworkforce in California's public schools. \nOn the latter point, the undisputed evidence at trial established that \nsince passage of the CBEST legislation, the percent of minority teachers in \nCalifornia has increased, as have the absolute numbers of minority teachers in \nall minority groups.  (DXI964atI4).  This increase is due to the substantial \nefforts undertaken by the CTC every year to encourage minorities to enter and \nremain in the teaching profession as well as implementation by the CTC of a \nnumber of affirmative programs to assist minorities in their efforts to become \nteachers.  (DX1964at12-14). \nThe CTC has never admitted that the CBEST has had an unlawful \nadverse impact.  Prior to the study conducted by Dr. Haworth, the CTC never \nAT L-2J7484 2  11 \n\nconducted adverse impact analyses on the CBEST taking into account all \nrelevant factors to determine whether race or ethnicity, as compared to test \ntakers' relevant preparation and/or skill level or lack of English fluency,  caused \nCBEST scores.21  Haworth's study established that basic skill preparati0n by \nthe test-taker (including number and level of er.glish and/or math classes taken), \nrather than membership in an ethnic group, determines the CBEST performance \nof the test takers.  Haworth's analysis of the data demonstrated that skill \npreparation differs among ethnic groups and that those differences, rather than \nethnicity, affect tht  performance of test takers in various ethnic groups. \n(DX1965at4).'o,  The Court found Haworth's analysis encouraging \"because it \nappears to show that preparation factors playa strong role in a candidate's \nperformance on the CBEST, regardless of the candidate's race or ethnicity.\" \nAs Mehrens reported, the most compelling evidence supporting the \nneed for the CBEST is the failure rate on the test itself.  (RT6/1O/96atl449). \nOverall, 20% of the entire test-taking pool (all races) fails on the first attempt, \n'if  Dr. Haworth is President of ERS, a firm which performs research on \nemployment discrimination issues with substantial experience in labor \neconomics, statistical analysis and database design and construction.  The Court \nher as an expert in labor economics and statistical analysis. \n~alified \n(KT6/3/96at786). \nThe results of Haworth's empirical studies are confirmed by the anecdotal \n10/ \nevidence presented at trial.  Robert Williams (a named Plaintiff) received his \nbachelor's degree in Physical Education by taking (and receiving grades of As \nand Bs in)  PE classes such as Folk Dancing and Badminton, but without ever \ntaking a single mathematics class.  Not sUrQrisingly', Williams was unable to \npass the mathematics sub-test of the CBEST.  SimIlarly, Toua Yang (a named \nPlaintiff) testified that English is his fourth language.  Yang passed the \nmathematics portion of the CBEST on his first attempt, yet liad trouble passing \nthe reading and writing portions of the test because of his lack of Englisll \nfluency,  not his race. \n12 \nATL-2J7484 2 \n\nmany of whom are college graduates.  Poggio testified that there is evidence of \nthe CBEST's validity, (RT6/13/96at1993), and agreed that the higher the failure \nrate on a valid test, the greater the demonstrated need for the test. \n(RT61l3fC)6atl9'27).  Plaintiffs'  recitation of the percentages of test-takers from \nCalifornia's colleges and graduate schools who fail  the test supports the need \nfor  the test.  Haworth's multivariate analysis  that the lack of \ne~tablishes \npreparation explains these failure rates and confirms the need for the CBEST. \n(CR276atJ). \nC.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n1.  This Court's review of the grant of summary judgment to Plaintiffs \non the applicability of Titles VI and VII is plenary, requiring application of the \nsame legal standards as those that bound the District Court.  Musick y.  Burke, \n913 F.2d 1390,  1394 (9th Cir.  1990). \n2.  This Court's review of the District Court's final judgment is \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), which states that the findings \nof fact  \"shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.\"  Plaintiffs seek to \nsubstitute a de novo standard of review for the more strict clearly erroneous \nstandard (one which they cannot satisfy) by summarily claiming that the issues \npresented are  \"mixed questions of law and fact.\"  Plaintiffs are not entitled to  a \nde novo  review of the Court's ruling because Plaintiffs have not identified any \nlegal error committed by the Court.  As the Supreme Court explained in \nPullman-Standard v.  Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 287 (1982),  when the district court \nis not faulted for misunderstanding the law or applying an erroneous definition \n13 \nA1 1.-237484 2 \n\nof discrimination, the reviewing Court must apply the clearly erroneous \nstandard of Rule 52.llf \nAs stated in Plaintiffs' brief at page 5, a de novo review of alleged \nmixed questions of law and fact is proper only when the  \"facts are established \nor admitted. \"il'  Review of Plaintiffs'  appeal brief reveals that Plaintiffs take \nissue with the factual findings below, which prevents Plaintiffs from claiming \nthat the facts are \"established or admitted\" and distinguishes the cases cited by \nPlaintiffs where a de novo review resulted in the application of law to \nundisputed facts.  ~ Bratt y.  County of Los Anie1es, 912 F.2d 1066,  1067 & \n1071  (9th Cir.  1990) (reviewing district court's ruling de novo where \"the facts \n[were] not in dispute\"); U.S.  y.  McConney, 728 F.2d 1195,  1197 (9th Cir. \n1984) (reviewing district court decision de novo where conviction was based on \nstipulated facts). \nApplication of the clearly erroneous standard to this case comports \nwith the overriding policy consideration of conserving appellate resources for \nissues it is best situated to decide (questions of law),  leaving the primary \nresponsibility for factual determinations with the district court because it is  in a \n\"superior position\" to evaluate and weigh the evidence,  in tum relieving the \nill  In the Civil Action Docketing Statement filed by Plaintiffs with this Court \non December 10,  1996, Plaintiffs correctly phraSed the issue to be presented as \n\"Whether the district court's factual findings regarding validity, job relatedness \nand CBEST alternatives are clearly erroneous.\" \n121  When citing Pullman-Standard, 456 U.S. at 289 n.19,  Plaintiffs fail  to \nmention that the discussion in footnote  19 of the decision is dicta inasumuch as \nthe Supreme Court stated there that it  \"need not address the much mooted issue \nof the applicability of Rule 52 to mixed questions of law and fact.\" \n14 \nAT L-2J7484 2 \n\nappellate court of the burden of engaging in a full scale independent review and \nevaluation of the evidence presented at trial.  McConney, 728 F.2d at 1201. \nThe Supreme Court adopted this rationale in Anderson v.  City of Bessemer \nCilY,  470 U.S.  564 (1985): \n[T]he parties to a case on appeal have already been forced to \nconcentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial \njudge that their account of the facts is the correct one; requiring \nthem to persuade three more judges at the appellate level \nIS \nrequiring too much .... the trial on the merIts should be the \nmalO event rather than a tryout on the road. \nIn this case,  the parties expended considerable energy and resources persuading \nthe trial court of their respective positions during the four year life of the \nlitigation below, concluding in four weeks of trial in 1996.  The trial on the \nmerits in this case was very much the main event, with the introduction of \nscores of expert reports and extensive, involved and highly technical expert \ntestimony and documentation, all of which were weighed and evaluated by the \ntrial court.  Plaintiffs' attempted recharacterization of the standard of review \nhere runs afoul of this Court's warning that \"more than mere lip service to  [the] \nstandard requires that [the Court]  ... not ransack the record, searching for \nmistakes.\"  Jauregui v.  City of Glendale, 852 F.2d 1128,1132 (9th Cir.  1988). \nPlaintiffs' suggestion that all disparate impact cases, as opposed to \ndisparate treatment cases, by definition require a de novo review finds  no \nsupport in the case law.  None of the cases cited by Plaintiffs for this \nproposition involved a claim for disparate impact.  McConney, 728 F.2d at \n~ \n1199 (in criminal case, de novo review of exigent circumstances for search of \ndefendant's home); Ilian, 912 F.2d at 1071  (reviewing de novo reasonableness \n15 \nATL-237484 2 \n\nof employer's claim of exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act).  This \nand other Circuit Courts have applied the clearly erroneous standard in \ndisparate impact cases involving issues of business necessity and job \nreJ:Ve--dness.  ~ nady v.  C(lunty of Los An!?eles, 770 F.2d 1421,  1434 (9th \nCir.  1985) (plaintiffs  \"failed to demonstrate that the court's finding of job \nrelatedness was cleady erroneous\"); Chaml;en: y.  Omaha Girls Club, 834 F.2d \n697, 702 (8th Cir.  1987) (\"Business necessity determinations in disparate \nimpact cases are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard of review \napplied to factual findings\"). \nThe correct standard of review, then, is the clearly erroneous standard \nof Rule 52: \nIf the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light \nof the record viewed in its entirety, the court ora PJX:als may not \nreverse it even though convinced that had it been SItting as the \ntrier of fact,  it woufd have weighed the evidence differently. \nWhere there are two permissibfe views of the evidence, the \nfactfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. \nAnderson, 470 U.S.  at 573.  As set forth below,  the District Court's rulings are \nmore than plausible in light of the record evidence at trial. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIn  their opening brief,  Plaintiffs selectively cite portions of the District \nCourt's opinion in this matter for the absurd notion that the CBEST was upheld \nas job-related based solely on the concept of \"face validity.\"  Review of the \nCourt's opinion reveals that the trial court thoroughly and thoughtfully \nconsidered the extensive empirical evidence and expert testimony and properly \nconcluded that Defendants' use of the CBEST as a low level screen for \n16 \nA TL-J37484 2 \n\nminimum competency of public school educators more than complies with the \nrequirements of Titles VI and VII.  Defendants undertook three separate \nvalidity studies of the CBEST -- the Wheeler and Elias Study, the Practitioners' \nReview and Dr.  Lundquist's Job Analysis and Content Validity Study -- all of \nwhich complied with the professional standards in place at the time for \nestablishing the job-relatedness of the CBnST. \nThis Court should disregard the recurring theme in Plaintiffs'  brief \nthat the only correct validation methodology is one which comports with \nPlaintiffs' view of the world.  Simply put, there is no such thing as a perfect \ntest, nor a perfect study.  This premise is recognized by well-established case \nlaw, which requires only that the test-user conduct a professionally acceptable \nstudy.  Defendants' evidence more than satisfies this requirement. \nFurthermore, the requirements of Title VII  must be viewed in combination with \nthe human risks and societal costs involved in this case, where the CBEST is \ncritical to the State's determination of minimum qualifications of a teacher \ncandidate, whose impact in the classroom (positive or negative) is great and \nlasts a lifetime.  Chrisner v.  Complete Auto Trans\" InC.,  645 F .2d 1251,  1262 \n(6th Cir.  1981) (when job at issue requires a certain degree of skill and \neconomic and human risks involved in hiring an unqualified applicant are great, \nthe employer bears a correspondingly lighter burden).  Indeed,  as Plaintiffs \nagreed at trial -- \"the critical issue is the education of the children of \nCalifornia. \" \nIn this appeal, Plaintiffs attack the Court's factual findings,  apparently \nin the hopes that this Court will weigh the evidence and testimony differently. \nATlAJ7484 2  17 \n\nSuch a review is beyond the purview of this Court.  Nevertheless, Defendants \nrespond to each of Plaintiffs'  issues by setting forth (within the space \nlimitations) the evidence presented at trial in support of the Court's fmdings, \nwhich sho!.lld  be affirmed  in their entirety. \nARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUfBORITY \nI.  Defendants are entitled to judiment as a matter of law beCause Title \nVII does not apply to Defendants' Iicensini activities. \nliThe specific evil at which Title VII was directed was not the \neradication of all discrimination . . . but the eradication of discrimination by \nemployers agains.t employees.  Silver v.  KCA. Inc., 586 F.2d 138,  141  (9th \nII \nCir.  1978).  liThe 1972 amendments to Title VII refer to government entities in \ntheir role as employers in the customary sense of the word and not in their role \nas regulators.  Geor2e v.  New Jersey Bd. of veterinary Medical Examiners, \nII \n635 F. Supp. 953, 956 (D.N.I.  1985), afDl, 794 F.2d 113 (3d Cir.  1986). \nThe State engages in many activities, only one of which is employment.  This \ncase presents a textbook example of Defendants acting pursuant to state police \npowers in  their roles as regulators.  As such, under well established case law, \nTitle VII is not applicable to the licensing functions of Defendants.  Haddock v. \nBoard of Dental Examiners, 777 F.2d 462 (9th Cir.  1985) (lithe legislative \nhistory of [Title VII]  supports the conclusion that the Board is not an employer \nwith respect to the persons taking the dental licensing exam. \"); Georie, 794 \nF.2d at  114 (Title VII\"  is not applicable to the licensing functions of a public \nagency exercised under the police powers of a state. \"); Woodard v.  Vir2inia \nBd. of Bar Examiners, 420 F. Supp. 211, 214 (E.D. Va.  1976) affj1, 598 F.2d \n18 \nA TI..-237484 2 \n\n1345 (4th Cir.  1979), (\"[T]he principles of test validation developed under Title \nVII do not apply to professional licensing examinations. \")  ; Ehret v.  The State \nll(J..ouisiana, 58 Fair Empl.  Prac. Cases (BNA) 658,662 (E.D. La.  1992) (\"a \nstate agency is  not an employer for the purposes of the ADEA or Title VII, \nhowever,  when it is sued in its licensing or regulatory capacity. \"). \nThe CTC's administration of the CBEST is indistinguishable from the \nrole of the Board of Dental Examiners and the State Bar Examining Committee. \nWhile failing  the test may prevent some individuals from being licensed in \nCalifornia, conversely, passing the test does not ensure that any individual will \nbe hired by any entity.  As a licensing exam, CBEST, like every other licensing \nexam, does not purport to establish that the licensed individual satisfies the \nrequirements for any particular job, but only that the person meets the \nminimum criteria for the specific profession at issue. See Woodard, 420 F. \nSupp.  at 214. \nThe Ninth Circuit already has rejected the argument that by regulating \nthe profession, Defendants become the Plaintiffs' employer.  In Haddock, the \ncourt held that the definition of \"employer\" under Title VII does not apply to \nthe licensing activities of the State of California.  777 F.2d at 463-464.  This \nCourt held that the Board's licensing activities were beyond the scope of Title \nVII because the Board \"neither pays the wages nor engages the services of the \nexaminees.\"  ML at 464.  It is undisputed that Defendants do not pay the wages \nor engage the services of CBEST examinees.  (CR37). \nIn a case the District Court here failed to mention, the Fifth Circuit \nrejected application of Title VII in the context of teacher competency testing. \nAT L-2374801 2  19 \n\nIn Fields v.  Hallsyille Independent School District, 906 F.2d 1017,  1020 (5th \nCir.  1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S.  1026 (1991),  the court held that because the \nevidence established \"no more than a licensing relationship,\" Title VII did not \napp!y to  the State's administration of the TEe AT.  The court in Fields relied on \nthe absence of control by the State over the\" 'work of an individuai, not only as \nto the resuit tu be achieved, but also as to the details by which that result is \nachieved.'\"  Id...-at 1019 (quoting Spirides y,  Rejnhardt, 613 F.2d 826,832 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1979».  Applying this \"control test,\" the court found  that the State \ndid not playa role in the general hiring or firing of teachers and was not \ninvolved in the daily supervision of teachers.  Id... at 1020.  Rather, because the \nschool districts in Texas hire and fire the teachers and are listed as the \nemployer on applications and personnel forms,  the court affirmed summary \njudgment for the State of Texas on Plaintiffs Title VII claims.  Id... \nPlaintiffs' case here presents a similar situation.  The State does not \nhire or fire teachers, nor is it involved in the daily supervision of teachers. \nMoreover, the school districts not only hire and fire the teachers, but also are \nlisted as the employer on applications and personnel forms.  (CR29;CR37).  The \nFifth Circuit's holding in Fields, and its application to the present case, is \nconsistent with the due regard which must be accorded to the states when they \nact in a regulatory capacity. \nThe District Court's reliance on Sibley Memorial Hospital v,  Wilson, \n488 F.2d 1338 (D.C. Cir.  1973), and its progeny for a different result is \nmisplaced.  Sibley \"had nothing to do with state police power.\"  National \nQr~anization for Women v.  Waterfront Commission, 468 F.  Supp. 317, 320 \nAT L-237484 2  20 \n\nIt\n(S.D.N.Y.  1979) (ItNOW ).  The court in Darks y. City of Cincinnati, 745 \nF.2d 1040,  1042 n.3 (6th Cir.  1984), found  that the rationale in Sibley has no \napplication to  licensing activities because Sibley  Itdid not involve a \n£overnmenC<>  licensing powers. It  See also Lavender-Caballero v.

Cases (BNA) 448, 450 (D.N.M.  1977) (liThe \nprocedures for admitting persons to the practice of law are distinguishable from \npersonnel decisions in private industry.  The Sibley rationale, therefore, does \nnot apply to  this case. \").  Accordingly, Defendants' licensing activities are not \nsubject to a challenge under Title VII. \nII.  Defendants are entitled to  judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs' Title \nVI claims. \nAs originally adopted, Title VI did not contain a definition of the \nterms  \"program or activity.  Pursuant to the Civil Rights Restoration Act of \nII \nATI-237484 2  21 \n\n1987 (CRRA), Congress amended Title VI to  include a definition of \"program \nor activity:\" \nFor the purposes of this subchapter, the term \"program or activity\" \nand the term \"program\" mean all of the operations of -\n(1)(A) a department, agency, special purpose dlstnct, or other \ninstrumentality of a State or 01 a local government; or \n(B) the entity of such State or local government that distributes \nsuch assistance and each such department or agency (and each \nother State or local government entity) to which the assistance is \nextended, in the case of assistance to a State or local \ngovernment.  42 U .S.C. § 2000d-4a (1988). \nThis langl'age demonstrates that the provisions of Title VI do  not,  nor \nwere they intended to, cover an entire state government.  Rather, the statute \ndefines  \"program or activity\" unambiguously to cover only a department or \nagency of a state government which receives Federal financial assistance. \nMoreover, the legislative history of the CRRA establishes that while the \ndefinition of program or activity \"make[s] clear that discrimination is prohibited \nthroughout entire agencies or institutions if any part receives Federal financial \nassistance[,]  ... [t]or State and local governments, Q!lly. the department or an \nagency which receives the aid is covered.\"  S.  Rep.  No.  64,  l00th Cong., 2d \nSess. 4,  reprinted in  1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 6. \nConstruing the statute to apply only to the department or agency of the \nState receiving aid is consistent with the reasoning in the Supreme Court's \ndecision in  v.  Ashcroft,  111  S. Ct. 2395 (1991),  which held that when \nGre~ory \ndetermining whether Federal legislation applies to a State government, courts \nmust \"be certain of Congress' intent before finding  that federal law overrides\" \nthe constitutional balance of federal and state powers.  ld... at 2401.

Applicatlon of the  \"clear statement\" \nrule of interpretation to the present case reveals that under the plain language of \nthe statute, Congress intended that Title VI apply only to a state depanment or \nagency, not to the state itself.  Accordingly, the State is not a program or \nactivity as defined l;>y  the statute, cannot be sued under Title VI,  and is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs' Title VI claims.  . \nWhile the CTC is an agency of the State, the CTC does not nor has it \never received Federal financial assistance.  (CR29atS).  The provisions of Title \nVI speak specifically to programs and activities which are \"receiving\" Federal \nfinancial  assistance.  Since the CTC is not receiving such assistance, nor has it \never,  the CTC cannot be sued under Title VI.  Stephanidis v.  Yale Univ., 652 \nF.  Supp.  110,  113 (D. Conn.  1986) (no coverage absent receipt of federal \nfinancial  assistance at the relevant time; the act applied only during the \"period \nin which federal  financial assistance was being extended\"), affd without \nopinion, 814 F.2d 654 (2d Cir.  1987). \nATL-237484 2  23 \n\nFinally, even if Defendants could be sued under Title VI, Plaintiffs \nshould not be permitted to pursue a disparate impact claim under Title VI. \nDefendants recognize that in Guardians Ass'n v.  Civil Service Commission, \n463  U.S.  582,  610 (1983),  a bare majority of the Supreme Court held that \npractices having a disparate impact may be actionable under certain agency \nregulations.  Id... at 642 & n.14.  The Court has established a confusing \"two-\npronged  approach to Title VI.  Alexander v.  Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 293 \nII \n(1985).  While Title VI itself requires a showing of intentional discrimination, \ndisparate impact may be actionable under the regulations. \nAlthough the majority in Guardians held that disparate impact may be \nactionable under the regulations, the validity of the regulations was not at issue \nin Guardians.  To the extent that such regulations apply to this case, they are \ninvalid because they exceed the scope of the statute which they seek to \neffectuate .. !lI  ~ Bakke, 438 U.S.  at 332, (\"[n]owhere is there any \nsuggestion that Title VI was intended to terminate federal funding for any \nreason other than consideration of race . . . by the recipient in a manner \ninconsistent with the standards incorporated in the Constitution. \").  \"1f \n'nowhere'  is  there any evidence that Congress intended the Title VI standard to \ndiffer from the constitutional standard, clearly an agency interpretation to the \n13 /  Neither the State nor the CTC qualifies as a program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance.  Thus, tile regulations promulgated by the different \nagencies of the United States government Cio  not apply to the State or CTC. \nNotably, Plaintiffs fail to cite to any §~ific agency regulations in their First \nAmended Complaint which apply to Defendants. \nATL-2J74S4 2  24 \n\ncontrary is entitled to rio deference.\"  Guardians, 463 U.S. at 611  n.5 (Powell, \nJ., concurring in judgment). \nIII.  The District Court's fmdin&  that the Wheeler & Elias Study and the \nPractiQners' Reyiew both included..A.proper job anal~~is in compliance \nwith professional standards is not clearly erroneous.-\nPlaintiffs' first issue -- whether Defendants conducted a professionally \nacceptable validity study of the CBEST, including a job analysis, at the time of \nits implementation -- is easily dismissed upon a proper review of the facts \npresented at trial.  Wheeler and Elias testified that their 1982 validity study \nincluded an analysis of the jobs at issue and examined the content validity of \nCBEST test questions.!~/  The Wheeler and Elias study analyzed the jobs at \nissue by empaneling 289 experts in the field  of education -- administrators, \nIII  Applying the more stringent burden of proof to Defendants, the Court \nreached the proper result that Uefendants \"satisfied this burden\" by showing \n\"that basic skills in reading,  writing and mathematics are il!lPQrtant elements in \nthe jobs for which the CBEST is  reguired and that the CBEST actually \nmeasures such basic skills.\" (CR417at29).  Even if this Court concludes that \nDefendants did not carry the heavier burden of 'proving that the CBEST was \njob-related, in connection with the validity studies conducted in 1982 and 1985, \nthe Court still must conclude, under the proper Wards Cove standard, that \nDefendants carried the burden of producmg evidence of job-relatedness. \nDefendants' pre-Act conduct is governed by Wards Cove  and only required \nDefendants to produce evidence of job-relatedness.  ~ <U.S.  v.  $814,254.67, \n51  F.3d 207,2  2 (9th Cir.  1995) (change in burden of proof \"directly implicates \nconcerns that animate the Landeraf default rule against retroactivity\"). \nPlaintiffs not only failed  to disprove job-relatedness, but also failed to carry \ntheir burden of proving the eXistence of equally vahd alternatives.  Wards \nCove, 490 U.S. at 659 (defendant only has \"burden of producing evidence of a \nbusiness justification for (the) employment practice.  Tile burden of persuasion, \nhowever, remains with the disparate impact plaintiff\").  Plaintiffs' fallure to \nchallenge the Court's holding on this latter Durden is fatal to their claim that the \nuse of the CBEST violates Title VII. \n15/ . Both Wheeler and Elias were well gualified for the assi.gnment. \n(RTZI5/96at96; 117-120;DX1960;RTZI7;g6at339-341 ~DX1961).  The Court \ncertified Wheeler as an expert at trial. (RTZI7 /96at3.:>0). \n25  . \nAT L-237484 2 \n\nteachers and teacher trainers representing \"the different subject areas, teaching \nassignments and grade levels\"  in the State -- who reviewed the CBEST test \nquestions and made judgments about the accuracy, fairness,  and clarity of each \niterr.. and the relevance of the basic skill measured by each item to the job of \nteaching in California's public schools.(RT2/5/96at121-122;RT217/96at343;347) \n(PX120).  As Elias testified,  \"the evaluation process by the panels of educators, \nexperts, good teachers, administrators, teacher trainers across the state\" \nconstir.lted the job analysis, which was in full accordance with the \nprofessionally accepted methods at the time.  (RTI/5/96at122;125).  Similarly, \nthe Practitioners' Review involved 234 expert panel members from the field of \neducation -- administrators, teachers and teacher trainers -- who were asked to \njudge the relevance of the skills assessed by CBEST and the individual CBEST \ntest questions.  (PX118). \nMehrens testified that the Principles for the Validation and Use of \nPersonnel Selection Procedures:  Second Edition (APA, Division of Industrial \nOrganizational Psychology,  1980) was the edition of SlOP Principles in place at \nthe time of the original development and validation of the CBEST in  1982 and \nat the time of the 1985 Practitioners' Review, and hence, set forth the \nprofessional standards to be complied with at the time .. !.f!'  The 1980 Principles \n16/  This Court should review carefully Plaintiffs'  references to the \nprofessional standards for proper time frame and contextual use.  The parties \nmtroduced two sets of SlOP  the second edition published in 1980 \nprinci~le~, \nand the third edition published in 1 8 , and two sets of APA Standards, the \n1974 edition and the 1985 revised edition.  Frequently, Plaintiffs cite to the \n1987 SlOP Principles and 1985 APA Standards when discussing the 1982 and \n(continued ... ) \nAT L-2J7484 2  26 \n\nstate that a job analysis \" ... may be a formal investigation, or the pooled \njudgments of infonned persons such as production engineers, job incumbents, \ntheir supervisors, or personnel specialists.\" (DX1969at19-20);  1974 \n~ ~ \nAPA Standards at 29 (\"The performance domain for published te!;ts might be \ndefined by the pooled judgments of job designers, incumbents and \nsupervisors\").  Mehrens further testified that the pooled judgments of the 289 \neducation experts in the Wheeler and Elias study and of the 234 education \nexperts in the Practioners' Review constituted a formal job analysis in \ncompliance with  relevant standards at the time.  (DXI969at23-\nth,~ \n24;RT6/11196atI562).!li \nThe job analytic and job relevance tasks undertaken in the Wheeler \nand Elias study and the Practitioners' Review are strikingly similar to the work \ndirected by Poggio (Plaintiffs'  expert) in Kansas in 1985 and  1993, in his \nstudies for teacher licensing for the State of Kansas, in which he conducted job \nanalyses by empaneling educators who were asked to rate the relevance of the \nskills on the test to competent teaching performance in Kansas,  regardless of \n16/( ... continued) \n1985 studies, which clearly pre-date the cited versions of the professional \npublications. \n17/  Plaintiffs' claim that Mehrens is not qualified to render such an opinion is \nludicrous.  The Court certified Mehrens as an expert at trial. \n(RT6/10/96atI430).  Acceptance of Plaintiffs' argument will  result in a fmding \nthat Plaintiffs failed to present even one qualified witness on the subject of \nvalidity.  Like Mehrens, Poggio and Haertel are education professors, not 110 \nyet they too rendered opinions regarding validity.  Plaintiffs' \nPsycholo~ists, \nonly testitying 1/0 Ps),chologist, Lefkowitz, was found  \"not credible\" by the \nCourt, rendenng his  opinions\" a nullity in this appeal. \n27 \nATI.·2J7484 2 \n\narea of specialization. (RT6/17/96at2105-06;2196;DXl727;1748).  Poggio \nagreed with Mehrens that the pooled judgments of panelists in the studies \nconstituted a \"formal job analysis,\" (RT6/17!96at2105-06),  and \"adher[ed] to \nstandards for educational testing and in consideration of legal standards for \nemployment testing.\" (DXl727at159). \nAccordingly, the Court properly found as a matter of fact that the \nWheeler and Elias study and the Practitioners' Review involved \"an appropriate \nform of a job analysis under the professional standards of the time, particularly \nthe then current version of the SlOP Principles.\"  (CR417at49-50).  In view of \nthe foregoing,  this factual finding is fully supported by the evidence at trial, \nincluding the expert testimony presented by Defendants and credited by the \nDistrict Court.  This Court cannot disturb such findings.  Contreras, 656 F.2d \nat 1282 (holding that district court conclusion that examinations are job-related \nand resolution of factual issues in favor of defendants' expert are determinations \nnot to be disturbed on appeal). \nPlaintiffs attempt to respond to this finding by claiming that the case \nlaw,  the professional standards and the Uniform Guidelines required Defendants \nto conduct a job analysis in a different fashion.'!!!  First, the case law does not \nrequire strict adherence to any single formula when conducting such a study, \nbut instead requires \"that the method chosen be professionally acceptable.\" \nContreras, 656 F.2d at 1281; see also Washin2ton v.  Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 247 \nli/ Plaintiffs'  \"discussion\" related to this particular ~int ~at pp. 36-38) is \nuns.\\Jpported by a single record citation, and is a \"speaking  piece created by \nPlamuffs on appeal. \nA1 1.-237484 2  28 \n\n---\n~-----\nn.13  (1976) (\"It appears beyond doubt by now that there is no single method \nfor appropriately validating employment tests for their relationship to job \nperformance. \").  None of the cases cited by Plaintiffs stand for the proposition \nall job analyses must be conducted in the exact same fashion- The District \n~hat \nCourt relied on the formulation set forth by this Court in Crai~ v.  County of \nLos Anieles, 626 F.2d 659 (9th Cir.  1980), which lists the general s!eps to  be \ntaken in the validation process, but does not purport to require an established \nmethodology for satisfying those steps .. 12!  Plaintiffs concede that Defendants \naccomplished the first step (specifying the skills to be measured) and third step \n(demonstrating a relationship between the test and work behaviors) described in \nCaii, placing at issue the second step -- determining that the skills identified in \nthe first step  \"are important elements of work behavior comprising or relevant \nto the job for which applicants are being screened.\"  hL. at 662-663.  As set \nforth above, the panel members in both studies were instructed to rate the \nrelevance of the basic skill measured by each item to the jobs in California's \npublic schools, which resulted in importance ratings for the skills. \n(RT2/5/96at121-122;RT217 /96at343;347;PX120).  As Mehrens explained: \nResults regarding relevance were what I would consider to be very \npositive.  The relevance judgments were made on a four point scale: \ncrucial questionable, or not relevant.  As can oe seen from \nimporta~!~ \ni \nTable  3 of the  wheeler &  Elias report, 34 of the 40 reading items \nand 24 of the 40 mathematics items had 70 % or more of the judges \nrate the skills the items measured as crucial or important.  In \nmathematics, the skills measured by another 9 items were rated as \nPlaintiffs'  reliance on the exact same quote from  (on page 37) \n19/  Crai~ \nfurther confirms that Plaintiffs do not take issue with the legal rulings of the \n~ourt (as they agree with the law as set forth by the Court), but instead \ndisagree with the Court's factual findings. \nAT L-2J7484 2  29 \n\ncrucial or important by between 60% and 69% of the judges.  Only \none of the reading items and three of the mathematics items received \nratings of crucial or imQortant by less than 50%  of the judges.  As the \ndata  Tables 14 and  f5 of the report indicate, there were few major \n10 \ndifferences across the categories of Judges.  Further,  \"for each of the \nmaior groups of judges, at least 76% of the ratings for the reading \nsection were judged crucial or imR0rtant.  The comparable figure for \nthe mathematics section is 65%\" (DX1969at20-21;PX120at18). \nThe professional standard for what is acceptably high judgment when rating \nimportance is the 50%  rule.  (DX1969at21).~'  The Court thoroughly \nreviewed and credited the testimony of Defendants' expert, (CR417at31-36). \nThis testimony establishes that Defendants satisfied the second step in Crai& - \nthe skills identified in step one were empirically proven to be important \nelements of work behavior comprising or relevant to the job for which \napplicants are being screened.lil \nSecond, Plaintiffs' quote from the Uniform Guidelines, as presented at \npage 34 of their brief, simply stands for the proposition that  job analysis \nj \nshould be conducted, but does not stand for the sweeping proposition that one \nparticular methodology is proper.  In fact,  the same section of the Uniform \nGuidelines is prefaced with the following statement: \n201  When conducting similar studies for the use of teacher tests, Poggio \nempaneled job incumbents to make relevance ratings and ap'p'lied what lie calls \n\"the strong majority  which means he will retain a sIQll  rated as important \nrul~\" \nor critical by as few  as :>6%  of his panelists.  (RT6/17/96at2196-98). \nill  The District Court made similar findings with respect to the Practitioners' \nReview.  (CR417at35-36). \n30 \nATL-2J7484 2 \n\nAny method of job analysis may be used if it provides the information \nrequired for the specific validation strategy used.  29 C.F.R. \n§ J607.14(A) (emphasis added).~' \nTnird, the  \"quote\" from the 1980 Principles presented on page 35 of \nPlaintiffs'  brief is a disingenuous ann misieading combination of selected \nsentences from two different pages of the Principles.  Properly presented in \ncontext,  the same portion of the Principles supports the Court's finding that \nDefendants conducted a proper job analysis in compliance with the standards at \nthe time [the portion deleted by Plaintiffs is in bold]: \nJob analysis is essential to the development of a content oriented \nQrocedure.  A number of job analysIs ~rocedures exist, each \niliffering in terms of its possible contribution to the objectives of \nthe particular study or a portion of the study. (PX650at4)}11 \nIn addition, the last sentence of Plaintiffs'  \"quotation\" begins with the words \n\"For example,\" obviously indicating that the development of task or behavior \nIII  This Court has followed the developing trend which holds that the \nUniform Guidelines are not legally binding.  Clady, 770 F.2d at 1428.  \"To the \nextent that the Guidelines reflect expert, but non-judicial opinion, they must be \napplied by courts with the same combination of deference and wariness that \ncharactenzes the proper use of expert opinion in general.\"  Guardians, 630 \nF.2d at 91. \nill Ironically,  in footnote 30 of their brief, Plaintiffs accuse the Court of \nengagjng in  \"selective reading\" and  \"radical rewriting\" of the  1980 Principles. \nThe Court properly cited the section of the 1980 Principles referenced by \nMehrens, whicb discusses the use of \"ppoled judgments of informed persons\" \nas a proper job analysis technique.  (PX650at13).  Plaintiffs, on the other hand, \ndeleted the relevant language from their quotation and combined other sections \nof the Princi~les out of context.  In additIOn,  Plaintiffs provide only pages 4&5 \nof the  1980  rinc~les, but not page 13, which is the portion relied on by the \nDistrict Court.aintiffs' failure to quote this document properly, including \nthose portions adverse to their position, borders on the sanctionaole. \n31 \nAT l·237484 2 \n\nstatements is ~, not the QIllx,  acceptable job analysis methodology. \n(PX650at4). \n241 \nAs the Court held,  subsequent revisions to the CBEST in light of later \nsDldies (discussed below)  \"does not mean that the prior version of th~ CBEST \nwas invalid.\"  Instead, Defendants properly validated the CBEST in accordance \nwith the professional standards in place at the time, and the evidence from the \nstudies justified the use of the test as job-related.  Lundquist's study and the \nCTC's subsequent modifications to  the CBEST demonstrate Defendants' \ncommittment to co nplying with the evolving professional standards and, when \nnew research suggested that the job had changed, the test was modified.  To \nhave done so in the midst of litigation should be commended, not \ncondemnedY'  Defendants' voluntary actions, taken in the ordinary course of \nbusiness, renders Plaintiffs' claims moot so long as Defendants show that the \n24/  Plaintiffs'  reliance on Section E12 of the 1974 APA Standards is \nmisplaced.  As Wheeler testified, Section E12 (and its subparts) applies to tests \nwhich are designed to test the entire universe of skills in a particular job.  The \nCBEST is designed to test a necessary part of teaching skills (basic reading, \nwriting and mathematics),  not the entire universe of teaching skills (which \nwould include classroom instruction technique and other J?edago~ical skills). \nAccordingly, Section E12.4 has no applicatIOn here.  (RT217/96at404-406). \n22/  Plaintiffs'  reliance on the denial of Defendants' Bill of Costs is specious. \nIn the context of ruling on a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 54, the Court stated that this case was different from cases cited by \nDefendants because this case had merit.  The Court did not find,  or even \nimplicitly concede, that Plaintiffs somehow established a violation of Title VII \nwnen denying costs to Defendants. \n32 \nA1 1.-237484 2 \n\nchanges are permanent and Defendants will not return to the challenged \nv. \nconduct.  United States  WT Grant Co., 345 U.S.  629 (1953). \n261 \nThe Court considered all of the evidence, including the testimony of \nthe experts. and decided as a matter of fact that the  198~ and 1985 studies were \nconducted in accordance with the professional standards at the time and \nincluded a proper job analysis.  This finding is not clearly erroneous, but \ninstead is  fully supported by the substantial evidence and expert testimony \ncredited by the Court. \nIV.  The Di .trict Court's fmdini that the CBEST is job-related is not \nclearly ;rroneous. \nOn page 41  of their brief,  Plaintiffs frame Issue Number 2 by \nclaiming that the Court erred when \"concluding that one or more separate job \nanalyses were not in order for nonteaching jobs.\"  This quote, however, is not \nthe Court's conclusion, but instead a piece of Plaintiffs' argument presented \nbelow.  The Court concluded \"that the CBEST has been adequately validated \nwith respect to  nonteaching jobs.\"  Furthermore, Plaintiffs' contention that the \nCourt relied solely on  \"opinion evidence\" for a finding of so-called  \"face \nvalidity\"  for nonteaching jobs is specious.  Once again, a review of the record \nand the Court's factual findings  readily disposes of Plaintiffs'  claim. \n26/  The changes to  the test were made effectiv~e August 1995 and remained in \neffect at trial in June 1996 and remain in effect today.  Despite Defendants' \nrevisions to the math section, the evidence at trial demonstrated that the adverse \nimpact on the Plaintiff groups remained unchanged.  Even if the  items removed \nwere not  \"job-related,\" -Plaintiffs are not entitled to any relief because (1)  the \nremoval of the items moots a claim for injunctive relief and (2) the presence of \nthe items did no harm and negates any claim for monetary relief for  \"past \nharm. \" \n33 \nAT L-237484 2 \n\nFirst, the Court held that Defendants \"have shown that basic skills in \nreading, writing and mathematics are important elements in the jobs for which \nthe CBEST is  required and that the CBEST actually measures such basic \nskills.\"  CCR417at29).  The Court cited the evidence which supports this \nconclusion, which includes: \nThe Wheeler and Elias study included teachers, administrators and \nother nonteachers as panelists who reviewed and rated the importance of the \nskills tested for  the jobs at issue.  After concluding that the importance ratings \nin this study supported a finding that the skills were important to the teaching \npositions at issue, the Court found  that \"there were no  major differences \nbetween the relevance ratings made by teachers and those made by \nnonteachers;\" (Id..at32-35); \nThe Practitioners' Review similarly included teachers, administrators \nand other nonteachers as panelists who reviewed and rated the importance of \nthe skills for the jobs at issue.  Again concluding that the importance ratings in \nthis study supported a finding that the skills were important to the teaching \npositions at issue, the Court found  that  \"[b]y examining the data from the \nPractitioners' Review, it is possible to determine whether the [importance] \nresponses of nonteachers differed from the responses of teachers.  They did \nnot;\"  CId...atn.36); \nThe Court exhaustively reviewed the results of Lundquist's study, \nwhich included \"a literature search ... on basic skill requirements for teachers \nat the kindergarten through twelfth grade levels;  interviews of teachers in \nII \ndifferent grade levels; job analysis survey form for teacher job activities;  \"a \nATL-231484 2  34 \n\nversion of the survey for administrators was created to determine whether they \nshared a common set of skill requirements with classroom teachers;\" \ndistribution of the survey to 6000 teachers and 1100 administrators; and \nsubgroup analysis by credential category, with itt'ms being dropped if any \nsubgroup analysis did not meet the required importance rating.  (IQ...at36-42). \n271 \nWhen summarizing the results of Lundquist's study, the Court found  that \n\"(b]ased on her comparison of teachers' and administrators' responses, \nLundquist concluded that 'all of the skills identified as important for teachers \nwere also important for administrators.'\" CW,J \nBased on the foregoing,  the Court properly concluded that \"the \nevidence shows that nonteachers generally rated the items on the CBEST to be \nas relevant to their jobs as did teachers.  Both the Wheeler and Elias study and \nLundquist's job analysis showed no significant difference between the \nimportance ratings made by teachers and those made by administrators and \nother nonteachers.\"  (kL.at49).  This conclusion is fully  supported by the record \nevidence. \nMoreover, Plaintiffs simply are incorrect when they claim that the \nCBEST must be validated for over twenty different \"jobs\" or \"positions.\" \nPassage of the CBEST is not required for any particular teaching or \nadministrative job(s) or position(s).  Instead, passage of the CBEST is one step \nthe process of obtaining a credential.  (DXI964at28).  There are four \nIn \ncredentials issued by the CTC for which the CBEST is  required: (1)  multiple \n27-1  Lun~quist. also conduc.t~ subgroup analyses by ethnic group, finding no \ndifference 10 rat lOgs by ethniclty. \nAT l-2374114 2  35 \n\nsubject, (2) single subject, (3) special instruction/education and (4) \nadministrative.  Educ. Code § 44256 and § 44270.  As the Court properly \nfound,  Lundquist analyzed the skills for subgroup differences by each of these \ncredential \"ategorif\"s.  (OX1541atT3hle5-21).  Lundquist examint'.d directly the \nratings by each credential category and eiiminated skills which, according to the \nempirical data, did not undergird ~ credential categories at issue.  (DX1541; \nDX1967).  In fact,  when Lundquist analyzed the subgroup of \"single subject \ncredential,\" she analyzed all single subject credentials together.  This analysis \nfavored Plaintiffs--by including all single subject credentials in one group \n(math,  reading, social studies, physical education), Lundquist retained only \nthose skills found to be applicable and important by 80%  of all of the people in \nthis group.  Accordingly, all credential holders had a voice, which resulted in \nthe identification of only the lowest, common denominator skills important to \nsill groups.  As a result, Lundquist testified at trial that there simply is no \nevidence that the basic  \"lowest common denominator\" type acquired cognitive \nskills tested by the CBEST differ for the credential categories. \n(RT6/6/96at1302-03). \nA comparison of the results of Lundquist's job analysis with the \nliterature reviewed at the outset reveals that across all of the studies the \ninvestigators found similarity in terms of the basic skills required for all \nteachers.  (DX1541atChap.2;PX216).  The literature review supported the \nconclusion that a common set of basic skill requirements cuts across the full \nrange of K-12 positions.  (DX1967at18).  Lefkowitz testified that he is not \naware of any empirical data to the contrary.  (RT6/12/96at1752-53).  As \n36 \nA 11.-2374&4 2 \n\nindicated by  Poggio' s 1985 study, he also believes that these basic skills cut \nacross all jobs.  (DXI727; 1748). \nLegally, there can be no dispute that Defendants' studies carried the \nday.  The APA  include separate  on employment \ns.taQqa,rd~  chapter~  t~~tjIlg \n(Chapter X) and on professional and occupational licensure and celtification \ntesting (ChapLer XI).  (PX208).  The licensure ana certification chapter (Xl) \nmakes it clear that licensure and certification tests, unlike employment tests, \nhave the purpose of protecting public safety.  (PX208at63).  The validity of \nlicensure and certification tests for credentials (like the CBEST) must therefore \nbe ascertained statewide in relation to basic public safety considerations rather \nthan the actual requirements of particular jobs offered by particular employers. \n(DXI964at23).  Under the relevant Chapter XI of the APA Standards, a \nlicensing or certification agency need not analyze every teacher's job or \nadministrator's job separately from an analysis of test specifications and \nquestions.  Instead, an analysis in which licensees (such as current teachers and \nadministrators) examine test questions in relation to  the requirements of the \ncredentials is  professionally proper and appropriate for licensure exams. \nNevertheless, Lundquist's Job Analysis established the importance of \nthe basic skills tested by the CBEST for each of the credentials at issue, which \nis  more than  \"suitable\" as required, and it is abundantly professionally \nacceptable.

The District Court's findin~ that the CBEST items actually measure \nthe basic skills of reading. writing and mathematics is not clearly \nerroneous. \nPlaintiffs'  Issue Number 3 is a theoretical exercise.  Basically, \nbe \nPlaintiffs contend that once a job analysis is conducted and the skills to \nmeasured by a tt st identified, then the actual test items must correspond to the \nskills identified.  There is  no  \"magic\" or single correct formula for \ndemonstrating the content validity of a test.  Instead, as this Circuit has held, \nand the Court recited, the test must be job-related,  \"that is,  'that it actually \nmeasures skills, knowledge or ability required for successful performance of the \njob. '\"  (CR417at28),  Contreras, 656 F.2d at 1271.  In accordance with \nquotin~ \nthis  legal standard, the Court found  \"[Defendants] have shown that basic skills \nin reading,  writing and  mathematics are important elements in the jobs for \nwhich the CBEST is  required and that the  CBEST actually measures such basic \nskills.\"  (Id.at29).  In response, Plaintiffs rely on Contreras for the over broad \nproposition that content validity of test items (the third step in  can be \nCrai~) \naccomplished only if patterned on the precise procedure approved in Contreras. \nPlaintiffs,  of course, overlook the basic admonition by this Court in Contreras \nthat a \"a key requirement of this third step ... is  that the validation method be \nprofessionally acceptable.\"  Contreras, 656 F.2d at 1282.  A review of the facts \n38 \nAT L-2374S4 2 \n\npresented at trial in this case will  result in the same conclusion here as was \nultimately reached in Contreras: \nAt trial, [Defendants] produced expert testimonLthat its validation \nprocedures met professional standards.  [PlaintittJ produced expert \ntestimony that toe procedures were professionally unacceptable.  The \ndistrict judge resolved this conflict of testimony  favor of the \n10 \n[Defendants'] expert, not only by ruling that toe examinations were \nJob related, but also by resolving every testimonial dispute between the \nexperts in favor of the [Defendants].  LThe appeals court] will not \ndisturb such a credibility determination.  Id... \nThe procedures followed by Defendants and their contractors was as \nfollows:  ETS trains professionals on its staff to be item writers, who match the \nCBEST items to the test specifications.  This match is then subjected to a \nreview by other trained ETS professionals, who are not involved in the initial \nwriting and matching process, but instead make an independent review for \nverification of match of items to skills.  Both Ms. Merritt and Mr. Ponisciak \n(from ETS) testified that they found a good match of the items to  the \nspecifications in their work on the Curriculum Matching Project. \n(DXI971;1972).  When NES  took over the administration of the CBEST, NES \nprofessionals examined the ETS classifications and matched the items into the \ntest specifications.  As Wright testified,  the NES personnel involved were \nqualified for  the task and performed it properly.  (RT6/20/96at2682-83). \nLundquist reviewed the NES match into the specifications and verified them as \naccurate.  (DX1968at12). \nDefendants' expert testimony at trial (credited by the Court) \nestablished that the items on the CBEST actually measure the job-related basic \nAT L·137484 2  39 \n\nskills of reading, writing and mathematics.ill  Based upon his review of the \nforegoing as well as the Wheeler and Elias study, the Practitioners' Review and \nLundquist's study,  Mehrens testified that the procedures followed for \n\\/aliriating the content of the test itself (matching items to the skills) were \nproper, the overall test development process was professional and resulted in \nappropriate content validity.  (DX1969at31-33).  Mehrens ultimately concluded \nthat the items on the test were matched to the content domain as required by the \nStandards.  (RT6/1O/96at1475-84).  Plaintiffs' expert witness, Poggio, testified \nthat he agreed that Defendants and their contractors professionally, \nappropriately matched CBEST items to skills.  (RT6/17/96at2119). \nA brief review of the examples of CBEST items presented by \nDefendants at trial further confirms that Plaintiffs are merely theorizing when \nthey contend that items were not matched to skills on the test.  Defendants \npresented the following two  math questions with the corresponding skills \ndemonstrated to be job-related: \nItem:  If the price of an item is  raised from $4 to $6, what is the \nQercent of increase? \nSkill number 72:  Recognize relationships in  numerical data (e.g., \npercent change). \nItem:  How many  112  pint servin2s of milk can a teacher give to her \nstudents out of j  gallons of milk? \nSkill number 77: Understand and use standard units in U.S. \nmeasurement system. \n28/  As to Plaintiffs' eXQert witness the Court expressly found  \"Dr. Lefkowitz \nA \nl~cking in credibility.\"  (CR417atn.2u).  According1Y,  Plaintiffs'  repeated \ncitation to Lefkowitz'  \"opinions\" presented to the Court in support of their \narguments are of no  moment in tnis appeal. \nATL-lJ741\\4 2  40 \n\nNot only did both sides' experts testify that these items clearly are job-related \nand match the skills identified (RT6/13/96at1943;RT6/17/96at2064),  but also \ncounsel for  the parties so stipulated.  (RT6/6/96atl186).  In response, \nPJ:.lintiffs failed  to present ev('n one ~xample of an item on the test that does not \nmatch the skills identified to be job-related.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs' \n2,)/ \ncontention in the abstrac( that the matching of items to skills was not conducted \nproperly was refuted by the evidence presented at trial by Defendants, coupled \nwith Defendants' expert testimony that the procedures were professionally \nacceptable.  The Court's finding  is  further supported by Plaintiffs' inability to \nidentify even one item on the CBEST which does not match the job-related \nskills. \nVI.  The District Court's findin~ that the retention criteria used in \nLundquist's Job Analysis was professionally acceptable is not clearly \nerroneous. \nAt trial, Plaintiffs took issue with various aspects of Lundquist's Job \nAnalysis.  On appeal, Plaintiffs have abandoned the vast majority of their \nclaims that the Job Analysis was somehow methodologically flawed and on \nappeal  focus  on the decision rules applied by Lundquist when analyzing the \nsurvey responses. Lundquist's job analysis project was conducted to  investIgate \nempirically the type and level of the reading, writing and math skills required \nfor the K-12 positions in the public schools in California.  (DX1967at7).  The \nI'l/  Rather, the scored item Plaintiffs presented is properly classified as a \nsimple algebraic problem,  which is skill number 75 and was determined by \nLundquist's studies to be jOb-related.  (RT6/6/96at1271-72;DX1968at12).  The \nCourt agreed with Lund9.uist that the item at issue involved solving for a single \nunknown.  (CR417atn.3J). \nA1 1.-237484 2  41 \n\nstudy also examined whether the same set of basic skills applies to \nadministrative and teaching support positions.  (ldJ  These data were used to \nascertain the extent to which the skills measured by CBEST are supported by \ncurrent job analytic information.  This job analysis project consisted of four \nmajor research steps, culminating in the collection of ratings from a large \nstatewide sample of teachers and administrators.  Lundquist maiied the survey \nto over 6000 teachers and over 1100 administrators, with a return rate of \napproximately 20%  for each group.  (DX1541).  The 1100 who responded to \nLundquist's survey constituted a large enough sample to provide stable and \nreliable results.  Moreover, the data established that this group was \ndemographically representative of the relevant population, with the exception \nthat all minority groups were overrepresented.  Plaintiffs agreed that the sample \nsize was sufficiently large for the analysis and agreed that overrepresentation of \nminorities was appropriate.  (RT6/12/96at1772). \nFor data analysis of the survey responses, Lundquist used a four-point \nscale (0 to 3),  with anchor points of 0  = not applicable,  1 = minor, 2  = \nimportant,  3  = critical. (RT6/6/96at1307).  To identify important activities \nperformed on the job, two relatively stringent decision rules were used.  Items \nwere considered important if both at least 80% of the survey respondents rated \nthe activity as applicable to the job and the mean Importance rating was 1.5 or \nhigher (on the 0-3 Scale).  Even Poggio and Lefkowitz agreed that the use of \nATL-237484 2  42 \n\nthe SO%  decision rule is professionally acceptable and, by comparison to their \nown work, exceptionally stringent. \n301 \nThe dispute on appeal with respect to Lundquist's decision rules \nfocuses on the use of a mean Importance rating of 1.5 or higher  the 0-3 \n011 \nscale.lli  There is no  real dispute that a 1.5 mean Importance rating is the \nmidpoint of Lundquist's scale.  Plaintiffs conten.d,  however, that Lundquist \nshould have used a mean Importance rating of 2.0 instead.  This argument \noverlooks the basic factual nature of the scale used.  As Lundquist testified,  she \nused a continuou:: scale, and the survey respondents rated skills by assigning a \nnumber of 0 to 3 to each skill.  When calculating the nwm importance rating \nfor each skill, Lundquist averaged the ratings assigned by the 1100 survey \nrespondents.  Obviously, an average of responses necessarily resulted in \nfractions of numbers (i.e.,  1.2,  1.5, 2.6).  Once these averages, or mean \nimportance ratings, were determined for each skill, then Lundquist exercised \nher professional judgment to determine the proper cutoff for  importance.  The \ndecision to use a mean Importance rating of 1.5 or higher is a matter of \nexperience and professional judgment. (RT6/12/96at17S7).  The testimony at \ntrial by  both sides was that there is no single professionally appropriate standard \n301  Poggio applies what he calls \"the strong majority rule,\" which means he \nwill retain skills that are rated as '!Pplicable by as few  as 56% of the survey \nrespondents.  (RT6/ 17 /96at2196-9~). \nll/  At trial, Plaintiffs took issue with both decision rules.  On appeal, \nPlaintiffs take issue with only the 1.5  mean importance rating.  Since the rules \nwere used in the conjunctive, it is  misleading for Plaintiffs to isolate the 1.5 \nmean importance ratmg from the SO % rule and then claim that the use of the \n1.5 mean importance rating was too low.  In combination, Lundquist's decision \nrules were overly stringent. \n43 \nAT L-2J74&4 2 \n\nfor retention of skills for the simple reason that there is no single scale used for \nevaluating skills.  (RT6/11196at1635-36).  The Court properly held that \nLundquist's judgment was professionally acceptable in light of the fact that the \nimportance of a skill is rated on a continuous scale (as described above) and  1.5 \n(which legitimately rounds to 2.0) was the lower limit of Important on \nLundquist's scale.  Plaintiffs summarily claim on page 47 of their brief that the \nCourt's finding does not satisfy the professional standards, yet fail  to cite any, \nmuch less credited, evidence to the contrary. \nThe professional standards require that \"[a]ny scales used to evaluate \ntasks and knowledges, skills and abilities (KSAs) should have reasonable \npsychometric characteristics.\"  (PX207atS).  Judged against this professional \nstandard, the Court properly found  that Lundquist's decision \"reflected \nmanifestly reasonable professional jUdgment.\" (CR417atn.38).  This is all that \nwas required.  ~ Contreras, 656 F.2d at 1281 (\"Title VII requires only that \nthe methods be professionally acceptable\"); Guardians, 630 F.2d at 95 (study \nprovides adequate assurance that the identified 'tasks and KSAs are those needed \nto perform the job). \nPlaintiffs' citations to  the Principles, the Standards and the Uniform \nGuidelines should be closely scrutinized by this Court inasmuch as they either \ndo not stand for any relevant issue or are misquoted and rewritten by Plaintiffs. \nTo begin,  the portion of the SlOP Principles cited at the top of page 46 of \nPlaintiffs' brief,  while properly quoted,  is irrelevant.  The quoted portion \nexpressly applies to sampling job domains,  which are distinctly different from \nthe issue of evaluating skills.  The job domains at issue in this case are the \nATL-237484 2  44 \n\nbroad categories of reading, writing and mathematics, which, as discussed \nabove, have been demonstrated as important to the jobs at issue in this case. \n(OX 19 69at 17 -18).  Plaintiffs' complaint about Lundquist's job analysis and \nrete:1tion criteria addresses skills within the domlins, such as math skill number \n77  _.  understand and use standard units in U.S.  measurement system. \nPlaintiffs have dramatically rewritten Section 14(C)(2) of the Uniform \nGuidelines by moving certain words around within the quote, and by so \nmanipulating the language in this fashion,  mislead the reader into believing that \ncriticality is required here when it is not.  The proper quotation actually reads: \nThe work behaviors selected for measurement should be critical work \nbehaviors and/or important work behaviors constituting most of the \njob. \nAccordingly, none of Plaintiffs' so-called citations to the professional standards \nactually support a conclusion that Defendants were required to demonstrate that \nthe skills on the CBEST are \"critical\" to demonstrate job-relatedness. \nAs set forth in the \"Issues Presented\" section of their brief, and \ndelimited on page 45 of the Argument Section, Issue Number 3 is limited to the \nuse of the  1.5 mean Importance retention criteria.  However, in a footnote, \nPlaintiffs also raise an entirely different argument, relating not to the criteria \nused in the Job Analysis,  but instead to the criteria used in the subsequent \nContent Validity Study.  Presumably, Plaintiffs would have included this \nfootnoted discussion in the text of their brief if they in fact considered it an \nadditional issue presented.  While this Court should not permit Plaintiffs to \npresent entire appellate issues in footnote discussion, Defendants respond. \nLundquist's Content Validity Study was not a  \"second bite at the apple.\" \nATL·237484 2  45 \n\nInstead,  as the Court properly found,  the CTC commissioned the Content \nValidity Study to  reeltamine the math skills on the CBEST.  Furthermore, \ncontrary to Plaintiffs ludicrous comment that the validity of the math section \nrooted ill  validity,\"  the Court's approval of the Content Validity \nW;:!~  \"fac~ \nStudy when ultimately fmding  the test job-reiated, was well grounded in the \nsubstanual empirical ev idellce submitted by Defendants and explained by \nDefendants' expert witnesses. \nThe evidence at trial established that the findings of the job analysis \nwith respect to  math,  in many instances, eliminated skills that were supported \nby the literature)Y  In two focus group sessions, twenty teacher educators \nwere presented with the complete set of 37 math skills originally submitted in \nthe job analysis survey and asked to rate the applicability of each skill, whether \nthe skill was required upon entry to the job, the current importance of the skill, \nand the future importance of the skill.  Statistical analyses of applicability and \nentry skill requirements were used to determine whether a skill was retained or \neliminated.  To be retained, a skill needed to:  1) be endorsed as applicable and \nneeded upon entry by at least 80%  of the teacher educators participating, and 2) \nhave average current and future importance ratings greater than or equal to two \n32/  Both Mehrens and Haertel testified that all teachers should be able to \ninterpret  stanines, and other measures related to \npercentages,~ercentiles,.l, \nstudent test scores.  (DX1969at2/-28;RT6/18/96at2385).  These skills (which \nwere 101,  102 and 103  in the Job Analysis)  were initially dropp¢ by the \nsurvey results.  Since, as Lundquist testifi~, and Mehrens and Haertel agreed, \nthe results of the data on some of the math skills were contrary to expert \nthinking in the profession, it was appropriate to follow up on the math skills. \n46 \nAT I..-2J7484 2 \n\nOn a three point scale (1 = minor; 2=important, and 3 =critical).33/  Use of these \nrelatively strict criteria resulted in retention of 26 of the original 37 math skills. \nNext, job content experts and community group participants were \nprovided with the set of 26 math skills determined by teacher educators to be important. \nThese expert panelists were asked to provide applicability and required-upon-entry \nratings and to judge what percent of minimally qualified teachers would be proficient in \nthe skill today and what percent should be proficient in the skill in 3 to 5 years.  Using \nthe stringent 80 % endorsement criterion on applicability and required at entry, content \nexperts retained 17 of the 26 skills, while community group participants retain 16 of the \n26 skills.  A disjunctive model was used to combine the results of the content expert \nand community group ratings.  A skill was retained for further analysis if either the \ncontent experts or community group members agreed that the skill was both applicable \nand required upon entry (using the 80% agreement threshold).  This approach resulted \nin retention of 19 out of the original 37 math skills as applicable and required upon \nentry for the job. \nThe Court's findings with respect to the Content Validity Study are \nconsistent with this testimony and hence not clearly erroneous.  Additionally, \nthe Court's ultimate conclusion that the math section is job-related fully \n33/  Plaintiffs claim that, since Lundquist used a mean importance rating of \n2.0 here (Plus 80% applicable), she should have used the same in the job \nanalysis.  However, while 1.5 was the appropriate mean importance rating for \nthe large sample job analysis, the very stringent 2.0 standard was proper here for \ndisconfirmatory evidence. \n47 \n\ncomports with the legal standards.  Specifically, after Defendants conducted a \nsuitable job analysis, the remaining requirement was to conduct a content \nvalidity study, as outlined in Guardians, and demonstrate that the content of the \ntest is (1)  related to  the content of the job, and (2)  representative of the related \ncontent of the job.  630 F.2d at 95.  The results of the Content Validity Study \nclearly satisfy these requirements. \nVII. \nb~11riS!inT~~:~iifr~~~~g~f;€g%~;;;~~c1i~\\ft~tSic \nclearly erroneous. \nAn emp oyer is not required to separately validate passing scores. \nCr;ii~ v.  County of Los An~eles, 626 F.2d 659, 665 (9th Cir.  1980) (\"EEOC \nguidelines do not require separate validation of passing scores\").  Instead, \n\"(wJhere cut-off scores are used, they should normally be set so as to be \nreasonable and consistent with normal expectations of acceptable proficiency \nwithin the work force.\"  ~ 29 C.F.R. 1607.5(H).J41  As the Court noted, \nthe SlOP Principles provide that the setting of cut scores is a matter of \njudgment, as opposed to the result of empirical studies, and  \"the only \njustification that can be demanded\"  is that the scores be supported by a \n-rationale which includes factors such as cost-benefit ratios and social policies of \nthe organization.  (CR417at64), Qyotin~ SlOP Principles at 32-33.  Applying \nthe proper legal framework,  the Court then engaged in a careful review of all \nof the passing score studies conducted by Defendants (which establish an \nll/ The APA Standards do not contain any language discussing validity of the \ncut score. \n48 \n,,11,237484 2 \n\nempirical basis for the cut scores in use) as well as the cost-benefit analysis and \nsocial policies implicated here. \n351 \nDefendants conducted a passing score study on the writing section as \npart of the Wheeler and Elias study.  ETS gathered 44 readers, f'xperienced \ncollege and high school faculty  members,  who reviewed 6800 essays from the \nDecember CBEST administration.  (PXI20atl4-15;F).  After this review (which \nresulted in over 20,000 readings) the readers worked together in a group \ndiscussion led by Dr. Burbank to determine the minimum score on the writing \nsection for a person to be licensed to teach in California.  They agreed \nunanimously that the desirable minimum passing score is  12 (on a scale of 4 to \n16), with an absolute minimum of 11.  (ldj.  Consistent with these \nrecommendations, a test-taker can pass with a minimum raw score of 11,  which \nis converted to a scaled minimum pass of 39, and a raw score of 12, which \nconverts to a scaled pass of 41.  (DXI964at17-18).  This writing score study \nreported by Dr. Burbank in  his letter is the study reported by Wheeler in  the \ntext of the report. (U PXI20atl4-15;withPXI20atF).  Honig, who was \ncharged with setting the cut scores, testified that he considered the data from \nthe Wheeler and Elias study,  \"took it into account\" and even reviewed test \nitems before making a decision. (RT2/6/96atI84; 190;207).  Honig also testified \nthat he  took this responsibility seriously and when making his decision \nemphasized that the CBEST was a key step in the improvement of the quality of \n22.1  At trial, Plaintiffs challenged the cut scores on the math and reading \nsections as too high.  On appeal, Plaintiffs do not challenge the Court's \nrejection of this argument and ruling that the cut scores actually may be too \nlow. \n49 \nATI.-2J7434 2 \n\nthe educators in California and eventually the improvement of Califorinia's \npublic school.  Evidently,  Honig not only relied on the empirical data when \nmaking his decision,  but also considered the social policies at issue with the \nCHEST.  Indeed. as Mehrens testified,  when administering an examination like \nthe CBEST -- which serves the very purpcse of protecting the public and the \nchildren from the mcompetent -- the test user should undertake a cost·benefit \nanalysis.  Obviously crediting this testimony,  the Court found that Defendants' \ncost-benefit analysis should weigh in favor of protecting the public. \n(CR417at66). \nContrary to the substantial evidence presented at trial and accepted by \nthe Court, Plaintiffs now request that this Court engage in an \"analysis\" of the \nwriting scores under an entirely new  \"theory,\" which Plaintiffs presented for \nthe first time in the post-trial proposed findings.  Plaintiffs did not elicit any \ntestimony from their experts in any report or even at trial that the proper \npassing score on the writing section should be a \"9 or 10. \"~I  All of the \ncitations in Plaintiffs'  brief relate to one table of data in a report and a 1982 \narticle published in the field  regarding passing score studies,  without any actual \ntestimony from an expert witness to explain the data or the publication,  much \nless testimony as to the relationship of the data and publication to the writing \ncut score study in this case.  By contrast, as set forth above, Defendants \nll/  In footnote 43 of their brief Plaintiffs claim that \"this evidence and this \nl \nissue\"  was presented below.  Ratner than citing to the transcript of the \nproceedings, or even to one of their experts' testimony,  Plaintiffs cite to their \nroost-trial r,roposed findings.  Since Plamtiffs did not present actual testimony or \n'evidence' on \"this issue,\" it was not properly before the Court and hence IS \nnot properly presented to this Court. \n50 \nATL-237484 2 \n\npresented the testimony of Wheeler and Elias regarding their study and the \nresults obtained by Dr. Burbank and his group of readers, as well as the \ntestimony of Wright and Mehrens about the professional approach used and the \nsC'ciaJ  f:lctors at work. \nDefendants' evidence was credited by the Court and is  not clearly \nerroneous.  Indeed, the evidence established that the writing score was not set \nat an arbitrary level,  but instead was set following a systematic process that \nreflects the good faith exercise of judgment.  Ricbardson, 729 F.  Supp.  at 822-\n23; Thomas v.  City of Evanston, 610 F.  Supp. 422, 431  (N.D. Ill.  1985). \nVIII.  !~8e~ilsi~ite1>~uGvid:~ceo~6i~ired to comply with the provisions of \nPlaintiffs' final  issue on appeal is easily resolved.  Basically, Plaintiffs \ncontend that Dr. Klein served as a court appointed expert pursuant to Federal \nRule of Evidence 706, and as such, Klein should have provided an expert \nreport to the parties and subsequently been cross-examined by the parties.  This \nargument is  meritless.  First, the Court did not appoint Klein as a Rule 706 \nexpert, but as a Technical Advisor to the Court.\"  (CR 375at2).  Accordingly, \nthe provisions of Rule 706 are not implicated in this case.  Reed v.  Cleveland \nBd.  of Educ., 607 F.2d 737, 746 (6th Cir.  1979) (FRE 706 does not govern the \nappointment of non-testifying technical advisor).  Second,  Plaintiffs actually \nagreed that Klein was appointed as a technical advisor pursuant to the Court's \ninherent power, not pursuant to Rule 706.  (CR431at13) (\"Dr. Klein was a \nspecial technical advisor for the Court and not a court appointed expert. \"). \nFaced with this admission and open acknowledgement that Rule 706 is not \nATL-237484 2  51 \n\nimplicated in this matter, Plaintiffs'  contention on appeal that Rule 706 applies \nand should have been followed is  frivolous. \nThere is no question that the Court had the inherent authority to \nappoint a technical advisor and properly exercised that authority. \nReiU~ \n:United  863  F.2d  149,  155-57 (1st Cir.  1988) (recognizing court's \nStt,l,~, \ninherent authority to appoint technical advisor when the court is faced with \n\"problems of unusual difficulty,  sophistication and complexity well beyond the \nlegal questions of fact and law with which judges routinely grapple\").  When \nappointing Klein, the Court found  that this was just such a case.  (CR375at2) \n(\"finding this to be an extraordinary case ... having problems of unusual \ndifficulty,  sophistication and complexity well beyond the legal questions of law \nand fact with which judges routinely grapple\").  Plaintiffs did not object below \nto  the appointment of a technical advisor nor did they object to the Court's \norder, entered on June 3,  1996, determining that Klein would be the Court's \ntechnical advisor. \nWhile their brief is riddled with unsupported attacks on Klein's \nintegrity and alleged,  but unstated bias, Plaintiffs have framed the issue with \nrespect to  the use of Klein under Rule 706.  Specifically, Plaintiffs' argument is \nlimited to whether the Court was required to  provide an expert report from \nKlein and permit cross-examination by the parties.  As set forth above, Rule \n706 was not the basis for Klein's appointment, and hence is not implicated. \nReilly,  863 F.2d at  156 (\"Since an advisor, by definition,  is called upon to \nmake no findings and to supply no evidence, provisions for depositions, cross \nquestioning and the like are inapposite\").  The same result would be reached \nA' fL.237434 2  52 \n\neven if Rule 706 were implicated here.  Rule 706 provides that a court \nappointed expert shall be subjected to cross-examination only if the witness \nmakes factual  findings.  Plaintiffs have not cited any evidence in the record \nwhich would even suggest that Klein made factual  findings  in this case. \nIndeed,  Plaintiffs have not cited a single reference in the Court's final  order and \njudgment which was outside the record evidence presented by the parties and \ntheir respective witnesses. \nMore importantly, the Court announced in open Court its intention not \nto call Klein as a witness for cross-examination.  (RT6117/96at2062).  Plaintiffs \ndid not object.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs' failure to object to this decision is fatal  to their \nClaim on appeal that the Court should have made Klein available for cross \nexamination. \nAT L-231484 2  53 \n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the \nDistrict Court's judgment for  Defendants be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nCALIFORNIA OFFICE OF  Daniel E.

Of\ncourse, such testing must be properly validated as required by\nfederal civil rights laws, and we believe that compliance with\nsuch laws is fully consistent with the federal government's\ncommitment to teacher quality.  The United States is filing this\nbrief to address significant jurisdictional issues, not to take a\nposition on whether the Court should enjoin California from\ncontinuing to administer the California Basic Educational Skills\n\n-2-\nTest (CBEST).  The only question we address here is whether\nCalifornia's system of testing is subject to judicial review\nunder Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.1  We\nsubmit that it is.\nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1, numerous federal agencies\nhave promulgated regulations to implement Title VI, which\nprohibits a recipient of federal financial assistance from\ndiscriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin in\nits programs or activities.  42 U.S.C. 2000d.  Those regulations\nprohibit, among other forms of discrimination, the use of\ncriteria that have unjustified discriminatory effects.  See,\ne.g., 34 C.F.R. 100.3(b)(2) (Department of Education); 32 C.F.R.\n195.4(b)(2) (Department of Defense).  A federal agency may\ninitiate administrative action if it finds a recipient is not in\ncompliance with Title VI or its implementing regulations.  See,\ne.g., 34 C.F.R. 100.6-100.10.  In addition, the Department of\nJustice coordinates federal agencies' enforcement of Title VI,\nExec. Order No. 12,250, 3 C.F.R. 298 (1980), and has authority to\nenforce Title VI in federal court.  42 U.S.C. 2000d-1.  \nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n2000e-5(f), the Department of Justice has authority to initiate\nsuits against public employers, and the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) has authority to initiate suits\n  1/  Because we do not have the complete record and had limited\ntime to prepare and file this brief, the federal government takes\nno position on the question whether CBEST has been properly\nvalidated, but argues only that it is not exempt from the laws\nrequiring such validation.\n\n-3-\nagainst private employers.  Title VII prohibits, among other\nthings, employment practices that have an unjustified disparate\nimpact.  See 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(k). \nThe U.S. Department of Education’s statutory mission is to\nassist state and local educational agencies and other educational\ninstitutions in improving the quality of, and promoting equal\naccess to, education.  See 20 U.S.C. 3402.  To carry out this\nmission, the Department administers over 100 grant programs that\naward over $35 billion a year, and supports and directly conducts\neducational research, evaluations, and data collection.  It also\nprovides technical assistance and information to educational\nagencies and schools.  A central priority of the Department is to\nassist States in developing higher content and performance\nstandards for elementary and secondary school students and in\naligning their curriculum, testing, and teacher standards and\npreparation with these higher standards for students.  See 20\nU.S.C. 5801, 5881-5889, 6311.  \nTeacher preparation and the enhancement of teacher quality\nare central purposes of many statutes administered by the\nDepartment of Education, including, for example, the Teacher\nQuality Enhancement Grant Program, which makes grants to States\nto support systemic efforts to improve teaching quality.2  See 20\n  2/  In September 1999, the U.S. Department of Education funded a\nthree-year, $10.4 million grant to the State of California for\nreforming state teacher certification requirements and for the\ndevelopment of a new statewide assessment to evaluate teacher\ncandidates for subject matter and pedagogical competence prior to\ninitial certification.\n\n-4-\nU.S.C. 1021 et seq.  This program includes a competitive priority\nfor States that strengthens their teacher certification\nrequirements to ensure that new teachers have strong content\nknowledge and teaching skills.  See 20 U.S.C. 1025(b)(2).  The\nstatute also includes accountability provisions that require\nannual state reports to the Secretary of Education on the quality\nof teacher preparation in the State, including the performance of\nteacher candidates on state certification examinations and annual\nreports to the public by teacher preparation institutions on the\npass rates of their graduates on teacher certification\nassessments of the State in which the institution is located.  20\nU.S.C. 1027.  \nThe district court correctly observed that “the State has an\nobligation 'to the public to maintain the highest standards of\nfitness and competence for the weighty task of educating young\nimpressionable students.'”  Association of Mexican-American\nEducators v. California, 937 F. Supp. 1397, 1402-1403 (N.D. Cal.\n1996) (citation omitted).  Moreover, this obligation has become\nincreasingly urgent.  As the National Commission on Teaching And\nAmerica's Future explained:\nGood teaching is more important than ever before in our\nnation's history.  Due to sweeping economic changes, today's\nworld has little room for workers who cannot read, write,\nand compute proficiently; find and use resources; frame and\nsolve problems with other people; and continually learn new\ntechnologies and occupations.  Blue-collar jobs that most\npeople once held will comprise only 10% of total employment\nby the year 2000, and the \"knowledge work” jobs that are\nreplacing them require levels of knowledge and skill\npreviously taught to only a very few students.\n\n-5-\nNational Comm'n on Teaching And America's Future, What Matters\nMost:  Teaching for America's Future Summary Report at 7-8 (Sept.\n1996).\nTeacher quality is critical in influencing student\nachievement.  What teachers know and do is the most important\ninfluence on what students learn.  “[S]tudies show that teacher\nexpertise is the most important factor in student achievement.” \nId. (Full report) at 6.3\nProperly validated use of basic skills tests is an effective\nmeans to ensure teacher quality.  The very nature of every\nteaching position is to impart knowledge and skills to children\nand to provide an educational role model for students.  The\nrecently released interim report of the National Academy of\nSciences’ National Research Council on testing and teacher\nquality concludes that:  \nA single test or set of tests can only measure some of\nthe characteristics associated with competent teaching. \nNevertheless, this difficulty does not negate the value\nof assessing basic skills, subject-matter knowledge,\nand pedagogical knowledge.\n  3/  One study found that differences in teacher qualifications\naccounted for more than 90% of the variation in reading and\nmathematics achievement among students in high-achieving and low-\nachieving elementary schools.  See id. at 7 (citing Eleanor\nArmor-Thomas et al., An Outlier Study of Elementary and Middle\nSchools in New York City Final Report (N.Y. City Bd. of Educ.\n1989)).  A review of 60 studies found that teachers' ability,\nexperience, and education are clearly associated with increases\nin student achievement, and that devoting additional resources to\nteacher education is the most productive investment schools can\nmake to raise student achievement.  R. Greenwalls, L.V. Hedges,\nand R.D. Laine, The Effect of School Resources on Student\nAchievement in 66 Review of Educational Research at 361-396 (Fall\n1996).\n\n-6-\nNational Research Council, Tests and Teaching Quality, Interim\nReport at 23-24 (2000) (hereinafter “Interim Report”).    \nAlthough there has been limited research on the extent to\nwhich state tests are effective in distinguishing between\ncandidates who are competent to teach and those who are not, see\nibid., evidence from studies that have addressed the\nrelationships between students’ and teachers’ scores suggests\nthat teachers’ test scores do help in predicting their students’\nachievement.4  There is broad educational consensus that teacher\nemployment or certification tests are needed to help ensure\nteacher competence.  Forty-one States require prospective\nteachers to pass one or more tests, either of basic skills,\nsubject matter knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and skills, or a\ncombination of these measures.  See Interim Report at 10.  Most\nof these states require a test of basic reading and math.  See\nid. at 11.  Although Congress has not endorsed any particular\nstate teacher exam, it has implicitly endorsed state practices to\nadminister these exams by holding States and institutions of\nhigher education accountable for, among other things, the pass\nrate for initial state teacher certification.  See 20 U.S.C. \n  4/See, e.g., Ronald F. Ferguson & Jordana Brown, Certification\nTest Scores, Teacher Quality, and Student Achievement at 133-157\n(Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy, John F. Kennedy School\nof Government, Harvard University) (Apr. 1998); Linda Darling-\nHammond, Teacher Quality and Student Achievement:  A Review of\nState Policy Evidence in Education Policy Analysis Archives at 1,\n9 (Jan. 2000); Robert P. Straus & Elizabeth A. Sawyer, Some New\nEvidence on Teacher and Student Competencies in 5 Economics of\nEducation Review at 41-48 (1986).\n\n-7-\n1021-1030.  Of course, such tests must comply with civil rights\nlaws.  \nThe United States agrees that States should insist on high\nlevels of skills from all of their elementary and secondary\nschool teachers.  The National Research Council Report cited\nabove makes clear that testing basic skills alone is not\nsufficient to determine whether a teacher candidate will be\nsuccessful.  Therefore, the Department of Education provides\nmillions of dollars in federal aid to assist in recruiting,\npreparing, and supporting high quality teachers who have not only\nbasic skills, but also subject matter expertise and excellent\nteaching skills.  \nWhile fully supporting the use of tests to ensure teacher\nquality, the United States maintains that teaching positions are\nnot exempt from Title VI and Title VII standards.  These\nstandards require job criteria that have a disparate impact to be\njustified as job related for the positions in question and\nconsistent with business necessity.  Teacher testing, like\ntesting of other employees, must be conducted within the\nrequirements of federal law.  Indeed, we believe that compliance\nwith federal civil rights laws is fully consistent with a\ncommitment to teacher quality.  The civil rights protections are\ndesigned to ensure that standards accurately measure and identify\nthose best candidates for the job or those candidates who are\nqualified for the job.  It is the position of the United States\nthat a properly validated test that measures basic skills is an\n\n-8-\nappropriate requirement for every elementary and secondary school\nteacher.  Federal nondiscrimination laws are consistent with the\nestablishment of high standards for all students and teachers.\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\nThe United States and the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission as amici curiae will address two jurisdictional\nissues:\n1.  Whether California's Commission on Teacher\nCredentialing's (CTC's) administration of the California Basic\nEducational Skills Test (CBEST) is subject to scrutiny under\nTitle VI.  \n2.  Whether the panel erred in ruling that the CTC's\nadministration of the CBEST is not subject to Title VII.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n1.  Plaintiffs, black, Hispanic, and Asian prospective\nteachers and administrators in California's public schools,\nchallenge the State's and California's Commission on Teacher\nCredentialing's (CTC's) administration of the California Basic\nEducational Skills Test (CBEST), a basic reading, writing, and\nmathematics test.  This test is given only to those persons who\nseek teaching or administrative positions in California's public\nschools; private school teachers and administrators are not\nrequired to take the CBEST.  Plaintiffs assert that the test\nviolates Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nbecause it has a disparate impact on blacks, Hispanics, and \n\n-9-\nAsians, and is not job-related or consistent with business\nnecessity.  \nCalifornia's Board of Education has received substantial\nfederal financial assistance continuously since 1983.  The\nmajority of these funds are distributed by the State's Department\nof Education to local school districts.  See Association of\nMexican-American Educators v. California (AMAE I), 836 F. Supp.\n1534, 1537 (N.D. Cal. 1993).  However, the parties agreed, in the\ndistrict court, that the CTC itself did not receive any federal\nfunds.\nThe district court denied cross-motions for summary\njudgment, holding that the test was subject to judicial scrutiny\nunder Titles VI and VII.  See AMAE I, 836 F. Supp. at 1541-1543. \nThe district court held that since the State of California\ncreated the CTC and required passing the CBEST as a condition for\ncertificated employment in the State's public schools, it was\nresponsible for ensuring that the CBEST satisfies the anti-\ndiscrimination standards of Title VI.  See id. at 1541, 1543.  In\naddition, the district court concluded that the CTC is part of a\npublic “school system” that receives federal financial assistance\nand, thus, is subject to Title VI.  See id. at 1544-1545; 42\nU.S.C. 2000d-4a(2)(B).  While the CTC does not itself participate\nin a school district's hiring decisions, the court noted that the\ndistricts may not hire anyone who has not passed the CBEST.  See\nAMAE I, 836 F. Supp. at 1544. \n\n-10-\nThe district court rejected the State's assertion that the\nCBEST is akin to a licensing exam and, for that reason, not\nsubject to Title VII.  See id. at 1549.  Moreover, following the\nanalysis of Sibley Mem'l Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.\nCir. 1973), the district court held that if the test does not\nsatisfy the anti-discrimination requirements of Title VII, then\ndefendants can be liable under Title VII for interference with\nthe plaintiffs' employment relationship with a third party.  \nAt trial, the parties debated the sufficiency and adequacy\nof three content validity studies submitted by the State.  The\ndistrict court ultimately rejected the merits of plaintiffs'\nclaims.  While the CBEST had a disparate impact on minorities,\nthe court concluded that it was lawful because it was job-related\nand justified by business necessity.  See Association of Mexican-\nAmerican Educators v. California (AMAE II), 937 F. Supp. 1397,\n1403 (N.D. Cal. 1996).\n2.  Both parties appealed and a divided panel issued an\nopinion on July 12, 1999.  See Association of Mexican-American\nEducators v. California, 183 F.3d 1055, amended and superseded,\n195 F.3d 465 (9th Cir. 1999).  The panel reversed a portion of\nthe district court ruling and held that the test was not subject\nto the requirements of either Title VI or Title VII.  See AMAE,\n195 F.3d at 474-484.  The panel also affirmed the validity of the\nCBEST.  See id. at 485-492. \n3.  The plaintiffs filed a Petition for Rehearing and\nRehearing En Banc.  Approximately two weeks later, the defendants\n\n-11-\nnotified the court that the CTC, in fact, had received federal\nfunds from the Department of Defense since March 3, 1996, under\nthe federal Troops to Teachers Program.  See 20 U.S.C. 9301 et\nseq.  Under this program, CTC serves as an information\nclearinghouse for California programs that help former members of\nthe Armed Forces and defense contractor employees to begin a\nsecond career in teaching.  The defendants conceded that “for\npurposes of this appeal, * * * since March 7, 1996, the CTC is\ncovered by Title VI.”  Notice To The Court Of A Change In\nCircumstances at 2 (August 17, 1999).\nOn October 28, 1999, the panel amended its opinion by adding\na footnote.  See AMAE, 195 F.3d at 475 n.3.  After noting the\ndefendants' Notice and CTC's receipt of federal funds beginning\nin 1996, the court stated:\nAs Plaintiffs have argued that Defendants are liable\nfor actions before 1995, our findings as to the non-\napplicability of Title VI before 1995 are still\nrelevant.  To the extent that Plaintiffs have sought\nrecovery under Title VI after 1995, we rely upon the\nalternative holding that Title VI was satisfied.\nIbid. (emphasis added).  \nThe plaintiffs again petitioned for rehearing and rehearing\nen banc.  In response, the defendants retracted their concession\nof Title VI jurisdiction since March 1996, based on the Third\nCircuit's opinion in Cureton v. NCAA, 198 F.3d 107 (1999).  On\nMarch 27, 2000, this Circuit ordered rehearing en banc and\nvacated the panel opinion except to the extent that it is\nreinstated by the en banc Court. \n\n-12-\n4.  In July 1999, approximately one month before defendants\nfiled their Notice Of Change In Circumstances stating that CTC\nwas, in fact, a recipient of federal funds since early 1996, the\nU.S. Department of Education awarded California's Title II\nTeacher Quality Enhancement State Grant.5  Pursuant to this\nthree-year grant, beginning September 1, 1999, the CTC has\nreceived federal funds to lead the State's effort to develop a\nstandards-based Teaching Performance Assessment (TPA) and to\nreform the State's teacher licensure and certification\nrequirements.6   Funding for the first year totals $3,257,866.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nPlaintiffs assert a \"disparate impact\" challenge to CBEST\nunder both Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  It\nis generally recognized -- and the parties do not dispute -- that\nan employment test that has a disparate impact upon minorities is\nlawful under Titles VI and VII only if the defendant can\ndemonstrate that the test is “job-related for the position in\nquestion and consistent with business necessity,” and there is no\nequally effective alternative with less adverse impact.  42\n  5/  California's Office of the Governor submitted the\napplication, although the CTC is the recipient, fiscal agent, and\npayee of funds from the Department of Education.  A copy of the\nnarrative portion of the Application for Federal Financial\nAssistance, California's Revised Year One Project Workplan and\nYear One Budget Proposal, and award documents from the Department\nof Education are included in the Addendum at pages 1-112.\n  6/  Under the grant, CTC, with other state education agencies and\nuniversities, also will take steps to increase teacher quality,\ndevelop strategies to better prepare undergraduates for the\nteaching profession, and reduce the mathematics teacher shortage\nin targeted locations.\n\n-13-\nU.S.C. 2000e-2(k); see In re:  Employment Discrimination Litig.\nAgainst Ala., 198 F.3d 1305, 1311-1314 (11th Cir. 1999); Lanning\nv. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., 181 F.3d 478, 487 (3d Cir.\n1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 970 (2000); see also Larry P. v.\nRiles, 793 F.2d 969, 982 n.9 (9th Cir. 1984) (Title VII disparate\nimpact standards apply to disparate impact claims brought\npursuant to Title VI regulations). \nDefendants contend, however, that the CBEST is beyond the\nreach of both Title VI and Title VII, because CTC neither\nreceives federal funds in connection with this test nor employs\nplaintiffs.  In our view, both statutes apply to CTC and, thus,\nthe test is subject to judicial scrutiny under both statutes. \nFirst, as a recipient of federal funds, the CTC is subject to the\nrequirements of Title VI.  See Department of Transp. v. Paralyzed\nVeterans of Am., 477 U.S. 597, 605 (1986).  In addition, given\nthe Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, a claim asserting a\ndisparate impact violation of Title VI need not be “program\nspecific”; that is, the alleged discrimination need not be in a\nprogram or activity that receives federal assistance.  See 42\nU.S.C. 2000d-4a; S. Rep. No. 64, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 7-10\n(1987).\nSecond, the State and CTC need not be the plaintiffs' direct\nemployer to be subject to Title VII.  A claim alleging that the\ndefendants' requirement of the CBEST for public school employment\nunlawfully interferes with a failing applicant's ability to seek\nsuch employment is cognizable under Title VII.  See Gomez v.\n\n-14-\nAlexian Bros. Hosp., 698 F.2d 1019, 1021-1022 (9th Cir. 1983);\nSibley Mem'l Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338, 1341 (D.C. Cir.\n1973).  Moreover, the CBEST constitutes a condition of employment\nsubject to Title VII -- as opposed to a licensing examination\nexempt from Title VII -- because the examination is limited to\nindividuals seeking public school employment, and applicants\ncannot obtain such employment without passing the CBEST.  See 42\nU.S.C. 2000e-2(k); Cal. Educ. Code 44252(b). \nARGUMENT\nI\nDEFENDANTS' ADMINISTRATION OF THE CBEST IS \nSUBJECT TO CHALLENGE UNDER TITLE VI\n1. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n2000d et seq., prohibits a recipient of federal financial\nassistance from discriminating in its programs or activities on\nthe basis of race, color, and national origin.  See Department of\nTransp. v. Paralyzed Veterans of Am., 477 U.S. 597, 605 (1986)\n(recipient of federal funds agrees, in nature of contract, to\ncomply with nondiscrimination obligations).  Since March 1996,\nthe California Commission on Teacher Credentialing has received\nfederal funds from the Department of Defense as part of the\nTroops to Teachers program, 20 U.S.C. 9301 et seq.  More\nrecently, the CTC also has received funds from the U.S.\nDepartment of Education.\nIf a recipient is a public entity, all of its programs and\nactivities or operations are subject to Title VI, without regard\nto the specific purpose of federal assistance.  See 42 U.S.C.\n\n-15-\n2000d-4a(1)-(2); S. Rep. No. 64, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 4, 16\n(1987).  For example, all of the operations of a state agency or\ninstrumentality are subject to Title VI even though federal\nfunding may be limited to one specific program.  See 42 U.S.C.\n2000d-4a; S. Rep. No. 64, supra, at 16.7  Moreover, if one agency\nreceives federal funds and transfers funds to a second agency,\nall of the operations of both entities are subject to Title VI. \nSee ibid.\nThe CTC was created by the California legislature and,\ntherefore, constitutes an instrumentality of the State.  See 42\nU.S.C. 2000d-4a(1)(A).  Because CTC receives federal funds, all\nof its operations, including the administration of the CBEST, are\nsubject to Title VI.  See 42 U.S.C. 2000d-4a(1); cf. Radcliff v.\nLandau, 883 F.2d 1481, 1483 (9th Cir. 1989) (“[r]eceipt of\nfederal financial assistance by any student or portion of a\nschool thus subjects the entire school to Title VI coverage”). \nThus, the panel correctly concluded that Title VI applies to the\nCTC after 1995 by virtue of its receipt of federal funds under\nthe Troops to Teachers program.  See Association of Mexican-\nAmerican Educators v. California, 195 F.3d 465, 475 n.3 (9th Cir.\n1999) (“To the extent that Plaintiffs have sought recovery under\n  7/  “For the purposes of this subchapter, the term 'program or\nactivity' and the term 'program' mean all of the operations of \n* * * a department, agency, special purpose district, or other\ninstrumentality of a State or of a local government * * * any\npart of which is extended Federal financial assistance.”  42\nU.S.C. 2000d-4a(1) (emphasis added). \n\n-16-\nTitle VI after 1995, we rely upon the alternative holding that\nTitle VI was satisfied.”).8\n2. In their Response To The Petition For Rehearing,\ndefendants asserted that this Circuit should follow the Third\nCircuit's analysis in Cureton v. NCAA, 198 F.3d 107 (1999), and\ndismiss plaintiffs' Title VI disparate impact claim.  Defendants\nnow assert that since plaintiffs' disparate impact claim derives\nfrom the Title VI regulations, that claim must fail because the\nregulations require a “program specific” connection between the\nfunding and the alleged violation. \nThe Third Circuit in Cureton was wrong, and this Court\nshould not adopt its analysis.  The Cureton holding directly\nconflicts with the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L.\nNo. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28 (1988) (Restoration Act), which\nCongress enacted to overturn the Supreme Court's holding in Grove\nCity.  See S. Rep. No. 64, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, 4 (1987). \nIn that case, the Supreme Court interpreted the phrase \"program\nor activity\" in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20\nU.S.C. 1681 et seq. (a statute patterned after Title VI) to limit\nthe coverage of Title IX to only those portions of an entity that\nreceive federal funds.  In response, the Restoration Act amended\nTitle VI, Title IX, and analogous statutes to define \"program or\nactivity\" to include \"all of the operations of\" an entity, \"any\n  8/  Given the unequivocal Title VI coverage since March 1996, the\nUnited States will not address in this brief whether the CTC was\nsubject to Title VI prior to 1996, particularly as this analysis\nturns, in part, on issues of state law. \n\n-17-\npart of which is extended Federal financial assistance.\"  Pub. L.\nNo. 100-259, § 6, 102 Stat. 31 (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000d-4a\nfor Title VI).\nThe language and legislative history of the Restoration Act\nmake clear that the statute's broad definitions of \"program\" and\n“program or activity” apply to all Title VI regulations,\nincluding the discriminatory effects regulations.  The\nRestoration Act states that its purpose is \"to restore the prior\nconsistent and long-standing executive branch interpretation and\nbroad, institution-wide application of those laws as previously\nadministered.\"  Pub. L. No. 100-259, § 2(2), 102 Stat. 28\n(emphasis added).  This reference to \"executive branch\ninterpretation\" indicates that Congress intended its overruling\nof Grove City to apply not only to Title VI itself, but also to\nthe administrative regulations interpreting the statute.\nThe legislative history confirms this interpretation.  A\nSenate committee report found \"overwhelming\" evidence that for\nnearly two decades prior to Grove City, both Republican and\nDemocratic administrations had interpreted Title VI, Title IX,\nand their implementing regulations as having \"the institution\nwide coverage that Congress intended.\"  S. Rep. No. 64, supra, at\n10; accord id. at 3, 7-9.  For example, the Report emphasized\nthat a former cabinet secretary had testified that coverage of\nTitle IX \"was exceedingly broad and that this broad coverage was\nreflected in the Title IX regulations promulgated during his\ntenure.\"  Id. at 9.  The Report confirmed that the purpose of the\n\n-18-\nRestoration Act was \"to reaffirm\" these \"pre-Grove City College \n* * * executive branch interpretations.\"  Id. at 2.  Similarly,\nthe House Judiciary Committee recognized that \"[f]rom the\noutset,\" the \"Title VI enforcement regulations\" provided \"broad\ncoverage\" and were \"intended to apply to the entity which has\nreceived federal funds, not just to previously identified\nparticular programs for which funds are earmarked.\"  H.R. Rep.\nNo. 829, Pt. 1, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 23-24 (1984).\nWhen Congress enacted the Restoration Act it was well aware\nof the Title VI effects regulations, which the Supreme Court had\nalready held valid in Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 463\nU.S. 582 (1983).  See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 829, Pt. 1, supra, at\n24 (discussing Guardians).  Senator Kennedy, a primary sponsor of\nthe legislation, explained that \"title VI regulations use an\neffect standard to determine violations and that the Federal\ncourts have upheld the use of an effect standard.\"  134 Cong.\nRec. 229 (1988); see also 130 Cong. Rec. 27,935 (1984) (Sen.\nKennedy) (judicial decisions approving discriminatory effects\nregulations \"will remain in effect after enactment of this\nbill\").  A case involving the discriminatory effects of certain\neducational practices was included among the Senate Report's\nexamples of pending administrative cases that were not being\naddressed on the merits because of Grove City, but for which the\nAct would restore coverage.  See S. Rep. No. 64, supra, at 13.9\n  9/  Individual members of Congress also expressed their\nunderstanding that prior administrations had interpreted the\n(continued...)\n\n-19-\nConsistent with that congressional intent, federal agencies\nhave interpreted the coverage of the Title VI regulations,\nincluding the discriminatory effects regulations, to reach those\nprograms that fall within the broad statutory definition of\n\"program.\"  See 42 U.S.C. 2000d-4a.  The Department of Justice,\nwhich coordinates executive branch enforcement of Title VI, has\nemphasized that the Restoration Act was designed to restore “the\nbroad interpretation of coverage” reflected in the “original\nregulations implementing Title VI”; thus, federal agencies\n\"should consistently apply the Act's definition to all of the\nactivities of a recipient,\" and \"should review their own\ncompliance programs to ensure that decisions regarding\njurisdiction currently reflect the Restoration Act's definition\nof program or activity.\"  9 Civil Rights Forum No. 1, at 3\n(Spring 1995) (Excerpts in Addendum, pp. 119-120).  The\nDepartment has taken the same position in policy guidance to\nagencies in enforcing Title VI.  See, e.g., Enforcement of Title\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Related Statutes in Block\nGrant-Type Programs, Memorandum from Acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Civil Rights Division at 5 (Jan. 28, 1999) (See Addendum\nat 113-118).\nMoreover, on May 5, 2000, the Department of Education issued\na Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that modifies its Title VI\n  9/(...continued)\nregulations as having institution-wide coverage.  See, e.g., 134\nCong. Rec. 247 (1988)(Senator Packwood); 130 Cong. Rec. 18,837\n(1984)(Representative Panetta). \n\n-20-\nimplementing regulations to incorporate the statutory definition\nof “program.”  See 65 Fed. Reg. 26464 (May 5, 2000).  As set\nforth in the Preamble, this modification does not reflect any\nchange in the Department of Education's institution-wide\ninterpretation of its regulations.  See 65 Fed. Reg. 26464-26465. \nThis NPRM is merely cautionary action to correct an improper\ninterpretation and to avoid further judicial rulings that adopt\nthe Cureton analysis.10\n    In addition, CTC has received federal funds since September\n1999 for the Title II Teacher Quality Enhancement State Grant. \nSee infra, pp. 3, 11-12.  A primary purpose of this grant is to\nmodify the State's teacher certification and licensing program. \nThe CBEST is a central element of the defendants' existing\ncertification program.  See Cal. Educ. Code 44252(b), 44830(b). \nThus, plaintiffs' challenge to the administration of the CBEST\nencompasses the very “program” now funded.  Accordingly, even if\nthis Circuit adopted the Third Circuit's “program specific”\nrequirement as set forth in Cureton, Title VI indisputably\napplies to the CTC's administration of the CBEST since September\n1999.\n  10/  This modification does not have any effect on the assessment\nof plaintiffs' claims prior to its issuance as a final rule.  The\npreamble, however, illustrates the Department of Education's\nprior interpretation of the institution-wide coverage of its\nregulations, including the discriminatory effects prohibition.\n\n-21-\nII\nTHE CBEST IS SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE\nUNDER TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964\nThe panel erred in its conclusion that CTC's administration\nof the CBEST is not subject to challenge under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.  First, the\npanel erred in concluding that Title VII did not apply on the\nground that the CTC and State are not the plaintiffs' employers. \nSee AMAE, 195 F.3d at 482-483.  Second, the panel erred in\ncharacterizing the CBEST as a licensing examination rather than a\nqualification for public employment.  See id. at 483-484. \n1. The panel concluded that the plaintiffs, if hired,\nwould be employed by the local districts and not by either\ndefendant.  Given the absence of an employer-employee\nrelationship between the parties, the panel held that there was\nno Title VII jurisdiction.  See AMAE, 195 F.3d at 482-483.  In\nreaching this conclusion, the panel failed to follow settled\nTitle VII law, including Ninth Circuit precedent.  See Gomez v.\nAlexian Bros. Hosp., 698 F.2d 1019, 1021-1022 (9th Cir. 1983);\nSibley Mem'l Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338, 1341 (D.C. Cir.\n1973).\nTitle VII prohibits action by an employer directed not only\nat its own employees and applicants, but also activity that\ninterferes with another's employer-employee relationship on\ngrounds prohibited by Title VII.  See Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1341;\n42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1).  Title VII prohibits discriminatory acts\nagainst “any individual,” rather than acts directed at an\n\n-22-\nemployee.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1); see Sibley, 488 F.2d at\n1341.11  In Sibley, a male private duty nurse hired by patients\nin defendant's hospital alleged that the hospital interfered with\nhis employment relationship with patients at the hospital because\nof his sex.  See Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1339-1340.  As the D.C.\nCircuit explained:\nTo permit a covered employer to exploit circumstances\npeculiarly affording it the capability of\ndiscriminatorily interfering with an individual's\nemployment opportunities with another employer, while\nit could not do so with respect to employment in its\nown service, would be to condone continued use of the\nvery criteria for employment that Congress has\nprohibited.\nId. at 1341.  Many circuits, including this Circuit, have\nfollowed Sibley and concluded that Title VII extends beyond the\ndirect employer-employee relationship to prohibit unlawful\ninterference with a plaintiff's employment opportunities or\nrelationship with another employer.  See Bender v. Suburban\nHosp., 159 F.3d 186, 188 (4th Cir. 1998) (without itself\ndeciding, notes all circuits to consider question have followed\nSibley).12\n  11/  Cf. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 345, 346 (1997)\n(“employee,” as used in Section 2000e-3(a), Title VII's\nprohibition on retaliation, encompasses former employees; “[t]o\nbe sure, 'individual' [as used in Section 2000e-2, general\nprohibitions] is a broader term than 'employee and would facially\nseem to cover a former employee * * * as well as other persons\nwho have never had an employment relationship with the employer\nat issue”).  In addition, Title VII's remedies provision, 42\nU.S.C. 2000e-5(g), encompasses relief that may be afforded an\nindividual other than an employee; e.g., injunctive relief and\nbackpay. \n  12/  See, e.g., Zaklama v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., 842 F.2d 291, 293\n(continued...)\n\n-23-\nIn Gomez, plaintiff, a contracting company president,\nalleged that a hospital refused to contract for his company's\nservices based on race.  This Circuit cited Sibley, 488 F.2d at\n1431, and held that plaintiff stated a valid claim since the\nhospital's alleged discriminatory actions interfered with the\nplaintiff's employment relationship with his employer, albeit his\nown company.  See Gomez, 698 F.2d at 1021.13  A plaintiff's\nopportunities for future employment in a given field need not be\nforeclosed completely in order to state a claim of interference\nunder Title VII; the plaintiff need only show that conditions or\nopportunities for employment are different than they would be\nabsent discrimination.  See ibid.; see also Lutcher v. Musicians\nUnion Local 47, 633 F.2d 883 n.3 (9th Cir. 1980) (recognizes\nTitle VII applies to instances where defendant interferes with an\nindividual's “employment opportunities with another employer” but\nnot business opportunities for an independent contractor); cf.\nEldredge v. Carpenters 46 N. Cal. Counties Joint Apprenticeship\nand Training Comm., 833 F.2d 1334 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied,\n487 U.S. 1210 (1988) (defendant cannot avoid Title VII liability\n  12/(...continued)\n(11th Cir. 1988); Spirt v.

See Mitchell v. Frank R.

It is well established that the use of selection\ncriteria, including an examination, to assess whether an\napplicant satisfies the minimum qualifications for a position is\nsubject to Title VII.  See 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a) and (k); see also\nAllen v. Alabama Bd. of Educ., 164 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir. 1999)\n(Title VII prohibits selection processes that “result in an\nunjustifiable discriminatory impact” on minorities); Griggs v.\nDuke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 432-436 (1971).  If the test has a\ndisparate impact, it may only be utilized if it is shown that it\nis “consistent with business necessity” and is “job-related,” and\nno less discriminatory alternative exists.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(k);\nsee In re:  Employment Discrimination Litig. Against Ala., 198\nF.3d 1305, 1311-1314 (11th Cir. 1999); Lanning v. Southeastern\nPa. Transp. Auth., 181 F.3d 478, 487 (3d Cir. 1999), cert.\ndenied, 120 S. Ct. 970 (2000). \nIn California, the CBEST is administered primarily by the\n  14/  Notwithstanding the panel's statement that a parent\ncorporation is “not usually” considered the employer of a\nsubsidiary's employees under Title VII, see AMAE, 195 F.2d at 482\n(citing Watson v. Gulf and W. Indus., 650 F.2d 990 (9th Cir.\n1981)), a parent corporation may be liable when it actively\nparticipates in or directs the subsidiary's operations.  See\nUnited States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 71-72 (1998); Watson,\n650 F.2d at 993 (“very different case” of potential liability if\nparent corporation “participated in or influenced the\n[subsidiary's] employment policies”).  Here, the statutory\nrequirement that local districts hire only teachers and\nadministrators who pass CBEST is comparable to a parent\ncorporation participating in a subsidiary's employment policies\nand practices, and, therefore, defendants can be held liable for\nany discrimination that results from such statutory requirements.\n\n-25-\nCTC.  Significantly, the governing board of a school district may\nalso administer the CBEST.  See Cal. Educ. Code 44830(b)(1).  The\npanel relied heavily on its determination that the CTC and State\nare not the plaintiffs' employers to conclude that the CBEST\ncannot be an “employment” examination and, therefore, must be a\nlicensing examination.  See Association of Mexican-American\nEducators v. California, 195 F.3d 465, 482-483 (9th Cir. 1999);\nsee also Fields v. Hallsville Indep. Sch. Dist., 906 F.2d 1017,\n1019-1020 (5th Cir. 1990) (state examination for prospective\nteachers considered a licensing exam because the defendant\nadministering the exam is not the plaintiff's employer), cert.\ndenied, 498 U.S. 1026 (1991).  \nThe reasoning of the panel and the Fifth Circuit in Fields,\n906 F.2d at 1019-1020, is fundamentally flawed.  Under this\nanalysis, the panel's conclusion would differ, despite the same\nexamination (CBEST) with the same consequence (inability to apply\nfor public school employment), based on whether the examination\nwas administered by the CTC or a school district.  The CBEST\nshould not be considered a “licensing” exam when administered by\nthe CTC but an employment selection device subject to Title VII\nwhen administered by a school district.  Who administers the\nCBEST should have no bearing; the significant fact is that\napplicants who fail the CBEST may not be considered for public\nschool employment.  The panel's and the Fifth Circuit's approach\nbegs the central question of what is the nature and manner of\nutilization of the examination in question, i.e., is passage of\n\n-26-\nthis exam a condition of public employment?  Cf. AMAE, 195 F.3d\nat 482-483; Fields, 906 F.2d at 1019-1020. \nCases holding that entities that issue licenses or\nadminister licensing exams, such as boards of dentistry, are not\nsubject to Title VII are inapposite.  Cf. George v. New Jersey\nBd. of Veterinary Med. Exam'rs, 794 F.2d 113, 114 (3d Cir. 1986)\n(agency performing police functions of State not subject to Title\nVII; agency is not an “employer” with respect to the plaintiff-\napplicant); Haddock v. Board of Dental Exam'rs, 777 F.2d 462, 464\n(9th Cir. 1985) (board is not an “employer” with respect to the\nplaintiff and fellow examinees); Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar\nExam'rs, 598 F.2d 1345, 1346 (4th Cir. 1979) (per curiam) (board\nnot an “employer”).  This Circuit and other courts have concluded\nthat the licensing entity is exempt from Title VII either because\nthe state is creating the entity or imposing conditions pursuant\nto its police powers, or because the entity does not meet Title\nVII's definition of “employer” vis-a-vis the applicant.  See\nGeorge, 794 F.2d at 114; Haddock, 777 F.2d at 464. \nThese licensing entities have been described as performing\nan “'in-or-out' screening function for the public -- it has the\npower to decide, on behalf of and for the good of the public, who\nis and who is not qualified to participate in a given\nprofession.”  Morrison v. American Bd. of Psychiatry and\nNeurology, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 582, 586 (N.D. Ill. 1996) (a board\nthat assesses a psychiatrist's qualifications for certification,\nyet is not determinative of the psychiatrist's practicing in the\n\n-27-\nfield, is not a licensing entity exempt from Title VII).  Thus, a\nlicensing authority imposes standards on an entire profession and\nare given primarily to regulate private conduct.  It is\nordinarily unnecessary, however, for a public entity to issue a\nlicense to regulate the conduct of its own employees.\nA critical distinction between the CTC's administration of\nthe CBEST and dentistry or attorney licensing examinations that\nwas recognized by the district court, see AMAE I, 836 F. Supp. at\n1549-1550, yet was discounted by the panel, is that the CBEST is\ngiven only to prospective teachers and administrators in the\npublic schools.  See AMAE, 195 F.3d at 483.  Teachers and\nadministrators in California's private schools are not required\nto take the CBEST.  Thus, the CBEST affects an individual's\nability to pursue public employment, but does not bar all\nprospects of working in a given profession as a licensing exam\nwould.  Cf. Morrison, 908 F. Supp. at 586 (Title VII claim\nagainst psychiatry certification board survives motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim).  Accordingly, the panel erred in\nconcluding that the defendants' administration of the CBEST is\nnot subject to Title VII. \n\n-28-\nCONCLUSION\nDefendants' administration of the CBEST is governed by the\nanti-discrimination requirements of both Titles VI and VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964.\nRespectfully submitted,\nC.

Department of Consumer Affairs,  William H. Orrick \n458 F. Supp. 213, 215 (S.D.N.Y. 1978). For the reasons \nUnited States District Judge  \ndiscussed above, defendants' argument that the CBEST is \nmerely a licensing examination is wholly without merit. ",

Defendants cross-appeal the \nDistrict Court's earlier finding on summary judgment that Title VI and Title VII apply to \nCalifornia's credentialing of public school teachers, and appeal the District Court's denial of \ntheir costs (\"Defendants' Appeal\"). \nI. Facts and Procedural History[1] \nEffective February 1, 1983, the California State Legislature amended the California \nEducation Code to bar the California Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing \n(\"CTPL\") from issuing any credential, permit, or certificate to any applicant unable to \ndemonstrate basic reading, writing and mathematics skills in the English language as \nmeasured by a basic skills proficiency test. Association of Mexican-American Educators v. \nState of California, 836 F.Supp. 1534, 1538 (N.D.Cal.1993) (\"AMAE I\"). In May 1983, after \nthree test administrations, the CTPL assumed full responsibility for revising and \nadministering the CBEST.[2] AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1539. \nThe United States has long provided California, through its Board of Education (\"Board\"), \nwith financial assistance for educational purposes; it is undisputed that the Board has \nreceived such federal financial assistance continuously since 1983. AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at \n1537. During that same time period, the California Department of Education (\"DOE\") has \ndistributed most of that federal money to local school boards. Id. \nAt the same time, however, neither the CPTL nor its successor the CTC have received any \nfederal funds. AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1538. Indeed, the District Court found that in the \nentire history of California's credentialing authorities, the federal government has provided \nfinancial assistance only to one project and that aid for that project ceased in 1979. Id. \nProportionately more of the minorities taking the CBEST have failed it, compared to \nCaucasians. This pattern appeared in the first administration of the test and has persisted. \nThe Plaintiff class of minority educators brought suit to enjoin the use of the CBEST, \nalleging that it has a disproportionate adverse impact on racial minorities, that the \nDefendants failed to properly validate the test, and that the Defendants failed to adopt \nequally 1062*1062 effective screening procedures with a lesser adverse impact. \n \n\n \n \nIn 1993, the District Court ruled on summary judgment that both Title VI and Title VII applied \nto the Commission's use of the CBEST as an employment screening device. Association of \nMexican-American Educators v. State of California, 836 F.Supp. 1534 \n(N.D.Cal.1993) (\"AMAE I\"). Following a bench trial, in 1996 the District Court held 1) that \nPlaintiffs had established a prima facie case by showing that the CBEST has a disparate \nimpact on minorities; 2) that all three studies of the CBEST submitted to the court proved it \nto be a valid measure of job-related skills; 3) that the passing score reflected professionally \nreasonably judgments about minimum skill levels of basic knowledge, skills and abilities for \nteaching jobs; and 4) that Plaintiffs had failed to show the existence of an equally effective \nalternate screening device. Association of Mexican-American Educators v. State of \nCalifornia, 937 F.Supp. 1397 (N.D.Cal. 1996) (\"AMAE II\"). The District Court subsequently \ndenied the Defendants' costs in an Order filed on February 12, 1997 (\"Order\"). \nOn appeal, Plaintiffs contend that the District Court erred in holding that the CBEST was \nproperly validated, and that the court violated Federal Rule of Evidence 706 by relying upon \nthe advice of an expert witness who was not subject to cross-examination and did not \nprepare an expert's report. The Defendants contend that the District Court erred in holding \nthat Title VI and Title VII apply to its administration of the CBEST, and that it abused its \ndiscretion when it denied their costs of $216,443.67. \nWe review de novo the district court's summary judgment ruling that Title VI and Title VII \napply to the Commission's testing activities and review the District Court's factual findings \nfor clear error. Under those standards, we conclude that Title VI and Title VII do not apply to \nthe Commission's administration of the CBEST and we therefore grant Defendants' Appeal. \nAs an alternative ground for upholding the District Court's judgment, we find that the District \nCourt's factual findings were not clearly in error and we therefore deny Plaintiffs' Appeal. \nHowever, because we conclude that a court may only deny a prevailing party all costs when \nthe party has engaged in misconduct, we remand the case to the District Court to \nreconsider Defendants' application for costs. \nII. Legal Analysis \nA. Standard of Review \nWe review de novo the District Court's conclusion of law that Title VI and Title VII apply to \nthe Commission's testing activities, Bagdadi v. Nazar, 84 F.3d 1194, 1197 (9th \nCir.1996), and review the District Court's factual findings for clear error. Clady v. County of \nLos Angeles, 770 F.2d 1421, 1427 (9th Cir.1985). \nB. Application of Title VI to the CBEST \n1. General Applicability of Title VI \nTitle VI was originally passed as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and it contains a \nprohibition on the use of federal dollars to subsidize racial discrimination: \n \n\n \n \nNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be \nexcluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination in \nany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. \n42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d. \nThe purpose of Title VI is clear: Congress wanted to avoid the use of federal resources to \nsupport discriminatory practices and it wanted to provide effective protection against those \npractices. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 704 n. 36, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 \nL.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \nIn the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Congress amended Title VI to \ninclude 1063*1063 a definition of \"program or activity.\" As amended, Title VI provides that: \nFor the purposes of this subchapter, the terms \"program or activity\" and the term \"program\" \nmean all of the operations of — \n(1)(A) a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or \nof a local government; or \n(B) the entity of such State or local government that distributes such assistance and each \nsuch department or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the \nassistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government; or \n(2)(A) a college, university, or other postsecondary institution, or a public system of higher \neducation; or \n(B) a local educational agency (as defined in section 8801 of Title 20), system of vocational \neducation, or other school system; or \n(3)(A) . . . \n(4) any other entity which is established by two or more of the entities described in \nparagraph (1), (2), or (3); \nany part of which is extended Federal financial assistance. \n42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d-4a. \nIn other words, the definition of \"program or activity\" provided by Congress means that if \nany part of a listed entity receives federal funds, the entire entity is covered by Title \nVI. Grimes v. Superior Home Health Care, 929 F.Supp. 1088, 1092 (M.D.Tenn.1996). \n2. Application of Title VI to the CTC: Title VI Does Not \nApply to the CTC Simply By Virtue of Its Existence as \nPart of the \"Public School System\" in California \nbecause the term \"School System\" Is Used More \nExpansively By The California State Constitution Than \nby 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d-4a(2)(B) \n \n\n \n \nThe District Court found that neither the CTC nor its predecessor, the CTPL, had received \nfederal funds after January 1, 1980. AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1538. The District Court went \non to observe that — although not a direct recipient of federal funds — the CTC could \nnevertheless be liable under Title VI if it was a part of a school system and any part of that \nsystem received federal funds. Id. at 1544 (citing 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d-4a(2)(B)). Reviewing \nthe structure of public education in California, the District Court held that public education in \nCalifornia was, in fact, a single school system and that as a State agency concerned with \neducation, the CTC was a part of that single school system. Id. at 1544-45. Since public \neducation in California receives federal funds, the District Court held that CTC was \ntherefore \"part of a `school system' referred to in subsection (2)(B)\" of § 2000d-4a. Id. at \n1544. \nIn concluding that public education in California is part of a single school system, the District \nCourt placed particular emphasis on a provision from the California State Constitution, \nwhich refers to public education in California as \"the Public School System.\" AMAE I, 836 \nF.Supp. at 1544 (citing Cal. Const., art. IX, § 6, ¶ 2[3]). Although the Defendants below \napparently argued that the CTC was outside of the \"Public School System,\" the District \nCourt rejected the argument. Looking both to the Constitutional provision \nitself 1064*1064 and to the state decisions interpreting that provision, the District Court \nconcluded that the California State Constitution establishes an \"entire, unified school \nsystem\" and that such a system included regulatory bodies like the CTC and the Board of \nEducation. AMAE I, 836 at 1544 (citing Kennedy v. Miller, 97 Cal. 429, 432, 32 P. 558 \n(1893) and California Teachers Ass'n v. Board of Trustees, 82 Cal.App.3d 249, 253-54, 146 \nCal.Rptr. 850 (1978)). \nWe do not disagree with the District Court's conclusion that the CTC falls within the \"Public \nSchool System\" established by the California Constitution. We do, however, disagree with a \ncritical assumption apparently made by the parties. We do not assume that the \"Public \nSchool System\" defined by the California Constitution necessarily qualifies as the sort of \n\"school system\" to which Congress referred in § 2000d-4a(2)(B). In other words, we do not \nassume that the term \"school system\" is used in the same manner by Congress and the \nCalifornia State Constitution. As a result, we must determine whether the whole edifice of \npublic education in the State of California would qualify under the federal definition of \n\"school system\" embodied in § 2000d-4a(2)(B). \nTo begin, we must determine the appropriate definition of \"school system\" as used in \nsubsection (2)(B) of § 2000d-4a. For this purpose, we start with the language of the statute. \nAs quoted above, § 2000d-4a(2)(B) applies to the operations of: \na local educational agency (as defined in section 8801 of Title 20), system of vocational \neducation, or other school system. \n42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d-4a(2)(B). \nOf the three terms included in subsection (2)(B), \"local educational agency\" is both the only \ndefined term and the only term to which any substantial jurisprudence has attached.[4] To \nunderstand the meaning of subsection (2)(B), then, we naturally begin by looking to the \n \n\n \n \ndefinition and history of the term \"local educational agency.\" Pursuant to Section 8801 of \nTitle 20, that term is defined as: \na public board of education or other public authority legally constituted within a State for \neither administrative control or direction of, or to perform a service function for, public \nelementary or secondary schools in a city, county, township, school district, or other political \nsubdivision of a State, or for such combination of school districts or counties as are \nrecognized in a State as an administrative agency for its public elementary or secondary \nschools. \nThe term includes any other public institution or agency having administrative control and \ndirection of a public elementary or secondary school. \n20 U.S.C.A. § 8801(18)(A-B). \nWe also observe that 20 U.S.C.A. § 8801 contains a definition for a \"State educational \nagency,\" which it describes as \"the agency primarily responsible for the State supervision of \npublic elementary and secondary schools.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 8801(28).[5] \nThe distinction between \"local educational agency\" and \"State educational agency\" is \nimportant in this case. It is true that the definition of \"local educational agency,\" read \nbroadly, could include any agency that had any regulatory control over a public school. \nHowever, such an expansive reading would ignore the fact that Congress has drawn a \ndistinction between the State educational agencies that regulate schools and the local \neducational agencies that administer those schools. Los Angeles Branch NAACP v. Los \nAngeles 1065*1065 Unified Sch. Dist., 714 F.2d 946, 951 (9th Cir.1983) (observing that an \n\"educational agency\" is either a \"local educational agency\" or a \"State educational \nagency\"); United States v. City of Yonkers, 96 F.3d 600, 619 (2d Cir.1996) (same). This \ndistinction is well established in the structure of numerous federal educational statutes that \nplace different requirements on State educational agencies and local educational \nagencies. See e.g., 20 U.S.C.A. § 1414(a) (providing for local educational agencies to \nsubmit applications to State educational agencies under Education of the Handicapped \nAct); 20 U.S.C.A. § 1103c (same for Teacher Corps); 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(c) (providing for \nreview by State educational agency of decisions by local educational agency); Beard v. \nTeska, 31 F.3d 942, 954 (10th Cir.1994) (distinguishing between \"local educational \nagencies\" and \"State educational agencies\"). After reviewing the statutory roles of State \neducational agencies and local educational agencies and the case law relating to those \nroles, it is apparent that \"local educational agencies\" are those which actually administer the \nlocal schools. \nIn determining what constitutes an agency which actually administers the local schools, the \nCourt is required to look to state law and practice to determine what entity is \"recognized in \na State as an administrative agency for its public elementary or secondary schools.\" 20 \nU.S.C.A. § 8801(18)(A-B). In this case, notwithstanding the State Constitutional provision \nthat public education is a part of \"the Public School System,\" we find that public schools in \nthe State of California are administered by school districts.[6] Such school districts are \nresponsible for the receipt and payment of bills and debts, and maintain their own \naccounting and payroll procedures. School districts purchase their own supplies, \n \n\n \n \nequipment, and transportation units. They separately negotiate employment agreements \nand separately hire, pay, and oversee the employees who teach and administer California's \npublic schools. School districts not only manage the schools on a daily basis, they also plan \nand execute the acquisition, management, and disposal of facilities. They are responsible \nfor the safety and security conditions in their schools. In short, the school districts — and \nnot the entire edifice of public education in California — constitute the primary agencies \nwhich manage schools within the meaning of \"local educational agency\" as used in 20 \nU.S.C.A. § 8801(18). \nOf course, neither the parties nor the District Court have asserted that the California \"Public \nSchool System\" is a \"local educational agency\" within the meaning of § 8801 and it might \nseem obvious that it is not.[7] Nevertheless, we think this discussion is important because \nwe think that it sheds light on the proper interpretation of § 2000d-4a(2)(B). \n1066*1066 Looking at the structure of § 2000d-4a(2)(B), it appears to us that Congress \nmeant to expand \"program or activity\" to all activities within administrative units like school \ndistricts. Aside from the catch-all phrase, to which we will turn momentarily, § 2000d-\n4a(2)(B) speaks only of \"local educational agencies\" and \"systems of vocational \neducation.\"[8] We have just discussed the limitations inherent in \"local educational agency\" \nand we think that the same limitation is obviously inherent in \"system of vocational \neducation.\" By a \"system of vocational education\" Congress meant any set of vocational \nschools or programs that were administered by a central body, with management over \nsupplies, facilities, and personnel. It is naturally possible (particularly in a smaller state) that \na system of vocational education could be a statewide system, but such a system would still \nbe a discrete system whose management characteristics are similar to school districts. \nWe think that the catch-all term \"other school system\" cannot be interpreted independently, \nbut must be interpreted in the context of the previous two terms. In determining whether \nsomething qualifies as an \"other school system\" within the meaning of § 2000d-4a(2)(B), we \ndo not simply ask whether it calls itself a \"school system.\" Labels alone are frequently \nmisleading.[9] Instead, we must ask whether its essential characteristics are similar enough \nto those school systems addressed above that we would consider them a single unit for \npractical purposes. For example, an educational authority which focused upon adult \neducation might not call itself a \"school system\" but might nevertheless operate with the sort \nof centralized management akin to a school district. By contrast, a loosely-affiliated group of \nprivate schools might refer to themselves as a \"school system\" for the purpose of creating a \nsports league, but we would think it clear that this alone, without more, would not subject \nevery facet of every school in the league to Title VI if one school alone received Federal \nfunds. Indeed, the Supreme Court has very recently made clear that not even the league \nitself is subject to Title VI merely because one member of the league received federal \nfunds. National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, ___, 119 S.Ct. 924, \n926, 142 L.Ed.2d 929 (1999). The critical issue is whether the schools are managed in \nrelevant respects as a connected unit. \nThe legislative history of § 2000d-4a(2)(B) supports this conclusion. The Congressional \nReport on the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 cautions that \"[f]or two or more schools \nto be considered a `school system', there must be some significant linkage between them. \n \n\n \n \nThus, for example, any group of schools whose only connection to each other is that they \nbelong to some umbrella advocacy or membership group, or that they are accredited by one \ncentral accrediting agency, would not constitute a school system.\" S.Rep. No. 100-64 at 17 \n(1987), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 19 (emphasis added).[10] \nA second comment from the Report deserves attention here. The Report states that \"[i]f \nfederal financial assistance is extended to one of three secondary schools 1067*1067 which \ncomprise a system operated by a Catholic Diocese, all of the operations within all three of \nthe schools in the system are covered.\" Id. This follows naturally from the fact that such a \nsystem would be similar to a school district. We observe, however, that while Title VI \ncoverage would be extended to the entire school system within that Diocese (which is \ntraditionally a metropolitan area), such coverage would not be extended to all schools in the \ncountry under the auspices of the Catholic church, nor even all schools under the auspices \nof a particular Catholic Metropolitan (the Catholic organizational unit that is territorially \nequivalent to a State). From this we conclude that Title VI extends to all activities within a \nschool district or its equivalent, regardless of whether the system calls itself a \"school \nsystem\" or not. \nIn the present case, we find that the State Constitutional requirement of a single \"Public \nSchool System\" in California does not mean that public education in California is a \"school \nsystem\" within the meaning of § 2000d-4a(2)(B). Although California requires that all of its \npublic schools be chartered under State authority, Kennedy v. Miller, 97 Cal. 429, 436, 32 \nP. 558 (1893), the fact that they all derive from State power is not enough to make all such \nschools and school districts together a single \"system\" in the sense required for Title VI \ncoverage. Cf. Gonzales v. State, 29 Cal.App.3d 585, 590, 105 Cal. Rptr. 804 \n(1972) (holding that while school districts exercise state power, they are each independent \nentities). As a consequence, we conclude that CTC is not covered by Title VI solely by \nvirtue of its existence as part of the \"Public School System\" of the State of California. \n3. Application of Title VI to the CTC: Title VI Does Not \nApply to the CTC Simply by Virtue of Its Existence as \nPart of the State of California because Receipt of \nFederal Funds by One State Entity Does Not \nAutomatically Subject the Entire State Government to \nCoverage. \nBecause the District Court found that § 2000d-4a(2)(B) resulted in coverage of the CTC \nunder Title VI, the District Court declined to consider whether the CTC was covered under \nsubsection (4) of § 2000d-4a. AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1545 n. 8. As we have reached the \nopposite conclusion, we must proceed to consider whether § 2000d-4a(4) applies to the \nCTC. \n \n\n \n \nAs quoted above, § 2000d-4a(4) extends the definition of program or activity to \"any other \nentity which is established by two or more of the entities described in paragraph (1), (2), or \n(3).\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d-4a(4). In essence, Plaintiffs allege that the State of California is \nsubject to Title VI as a recipient of federal funds and that the CTC is covered under Title VI \nbecause the CTC is established by the State of California. \nWe disagree. Because the State itself cannot be considered a \"program or activity\" under § \n2000d-4(a), only subsections of the State and not the State as a whole can be subject to \nTitle VI.[11] The 1068*1068 CTC was not established by any subsection of the State subject to \nTitle VI,[12] and consequently the CTC is not covered under § 2000d-4a(4). \nAs laid out above, § 2000d-4a(1) extends the definition of \"program or activity\" to all of the \noperations of \"a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a \nState or local government\" and to all of the operations of \"the entity of such State or local \ngovernment that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and \neach other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended.\" 42 \nU.S.C.A. § 2000d-4a(1)(A & B). In other words, § 2000d-4a(1) applies to any department or \nagency of the State which has received federal funds, whether the State entity receives \nsuch funds directly from the government or via another State entity. \nAt the same time, however, nothing in § 2000d-4a would include the State, as such, in the \nenumeration of entities listed in the definition of \"program or activity.\" This omission cannot \nbe accidental. Although we could begin with the interpretive cannon, expressio unius, the \nstructure of the statute is direct and conclusive proof that Congress did not mean to subject \nan entire State to Title VI. Congress went to great lengths in subsection (1)(B) to detail the \nfact that each department or agency of a State which received federal funds would be \nsubject to Title VI, even if they received such funds via another agency. Subsection (1)(B) \nwould be superfluous if receipt by one agency of the State subjected the entire State to Title \nVI, and we strive to avoid any construction that would render some of the statute \nsuperfluous. Burrey v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co., 159 F.3d 388, 393 (9th Cir.1998). \nCongress simply could not have meant to extend Title VI to the entire State government \nbecause one department or agency received aid (even aid intended for the State). \nAgain, the legislative history supports our conclusion. The Congressional Report explicitly \nconcluded that \"[f]or State and local governments, only the department or agency which \nreceives the aid is covered.\" S. Rep. 100-64 (1987), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 6. \nAlthough this is an issue of first impression in our Circuit, other Circuits interpreting the Civil \nRights Restoration Act have also come to this conclusion. Schroeder v. City of Chicago, 927 \nF.2d 957, 961 (7th Cir.1991); Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, Texas, 118 F.3d 421, 427 \n(5th Cir.1997). In sum, we hold that while Title VI may apply to any subsection of the State \nwhich receives federal funds, Title VI will not apply to the State as a whole simply because \none subsection receives such funds. \nThe District Court found that \"the United States has long provided the State, through its \nBoard of Education, financial assistance for use in education.\" AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at \n1537. The District Court also found that \"the California Department of Education (`DOE') \nhas distributed most of that money to local school boards.\" Id. These findings indicate that \n \n\n \n \nthe California Board of Education, the Department of Education, and the local school boards \nare 1069*1069 all subject to Title VI under § 2000d-4a(1)(A) & (B). However, although the \nmoney may have been given to the Board of Education on behalf of the State, it is that \nagency and not the State as a whole which is covered by Title VI as a result. \nThe CTC was not created by the Board of Education, the Department of Education, or the \nlocal school boards. As a result, although such agencies are covered by Title VI, the CTC is \nnot covered by virtue of § 2000d-4a(4). \nIn sum, we conclude that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the CTC is covered by \nTitle VI and we order the District Court to dismiss Plaintiffs' Title VI claim against the CTC. \n4. Application of Title VI to California's Statutory \nRequirement that Prospective Teachers Pass the \nCBEST: As Neither the Legislature Nor the CTC \nReceives Federal Funding, Title VI Does Not Attach to \nthe State's Requirement For Teacher Certification \nOur conclusion in the previous section that the State of California is not automatically \nsubject to Title VI compels the conclusion that the State of California is not liable under Title \nVI for imposing the CBEST as a statutory requirement for a public teacher's credential. The \nreceipt of federal funds by the California Board of Education subjects the Board to Title VI, \nbut it does not extend the coverage of Title VI into all of the operations of the entire State. \nLikewise, the receipt of federal funds by the California Department of Education subjects \nthat Department to Title VI, but it does not extend coverage of Title VI into all operations of \nthe entire State. In this case, the statutory requirement was imposed by the California \nLegislature. It is clear that Title VI coverage does not attach directly to the requirement as \nimposed by the Legislature. \nAs we have found that the CTC is not a covered program or activity, and as there is no \nevidence that the Legislature is a covered program or activity, no Title VI liability could \npossibly result from their actions. \nC. Application of Title VII to the State Requirement \nthat School Districts May Only Employ Credentialed \nIndividuals \n1. Title VII Applies to Relationships Between \nGovernment Employers and Government Employees \n \n\n \n \nTitle VII was also originally passed as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and Title VII makes \nit \"an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire . . . any \nindividual . . . because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 \nU.S.C.A. § 2000e-2(a)(1). It is well established that Title VII applies \"to governmental and \nprivate employers alike.\" Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 332 n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 \nL.Ed.2d 786 (1977); Blake v. City of Los Angeles, 595 F.2d 1367, 1372 (9th Cir.1979). \n2. Title VII Does Not Apply to the State's Requirement \nof the CBEST for Potential Teachers Because the \nCBEST is a Licensing Exam \nDefendants argued below that the CBEST was part of the State's licensing process for \npublic school teachers, relying upon the fact that Title VII does not apply to governmental \nlicensing activities. See Haddock v. Board of Dental Exam'rs, 777 F.2d 462, 464 (9th \nCir.1985) (holding that Title VII did not apply to licensing activities of California's Board of \nDental Examiners). \nAlthough the District Court agreed that Title VII does not apply to governmental licensing \nactivities, AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1549, the District Court concluded that the CBEST was \nnot a licensing exam because it only licensed public school teachers. Id. The District Court \nobserved that one could be a teacher in a private school without having passed the CBEST, \nand that the CBEST only stood as a barrier to employment in the State's \"own \nschools.\" 1070*1070 Id. For that reason, the District Court determined that \"the CBEST is an \nexamination that tests an individual's qualification for a job with a particular employer (the \nState), not an examination that tests minimal competence for the job of teaching.\" Id. \nWe agree with the District Court that, if the State requires an exam solely for its own \nemployees, such an exam constitutes an employment exam. We also think it evident that \nTitle VII applies even if the purpose of the exam is to improve the quality of the State's \nservice to the public, because virtually any State employment exam could be cast as an \nattempt to improve the quality of the State's service to the public. \na. The CBEST Is Not an Employment Exam Because \nthe State Is Not the Potential Employer \nNevertheless, we do not agree with the characterization of the CBEST as testing for a \n\"particular employer (the State).\" We note that, immediately after determining that the \nCBEST was an employment exam, the District Court then discussed the fact that teachers \nare not employed by the Defendants. AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1550. The parties and the \nlower court agree that teachers are \"employees\" of the various school districts, rather than \nemployees of the State or of the CTC. Id. \nAs such, we cannot agree that the State is the \"employer\" in this instance. We recognize \nthat school districts in California are instrumentalities of the State, Belanger v. Madera \n \n\n \n \nUnified Sch. Dist., 963 F.2d 248, 251-54 (9th Cir.1992); First Interstate Bank of California v. \nState, Board of Governors of California, 197 Cal.App.3d 627, 633, 243 Cal.Rptr. 8 \n(1987), but we view the relationship between school districts and the State as analogous to \nthe parent/subsidiary relationship. It is well established that a parent company will not \nusually be considered the \"employer\" under Title VII for the employees of its \nsubsidiary. Watson v. Gulf & Western, 650 F.2d 990, 993 (9th Cir.1981).[13] It is likewise \nwell-established in California that the school districts, although \"exercising a portion of the \nstate's powers of government, are not the state or a part of the state,\" Gonzales v. State of \nCalifornia, 29 Cal.App.3d 585, 590, 105 Cal.Rptr. 804 (1972), and that employees of the \nschool districts are not employees of the State. Id. at 590-91, 105 Cal.Rptr. 804 (observing \nthat employee \"compensation is fixed by the district and not the state,\" that the employee \"is \npaid by the district and not the state,\" that \"the scope of his employment is determined by \nthe district and not by the state,\" that \"the right to control and supervise him is vested \nexclusively in the district by the state without reservation,\" and that \"he may be discharged \nby the district for cause, and not by the state.\"); see also Norton Sound Health v. Bering \nStrait Sch. Dist., 138 F.3d 1281, 1284 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that, in applying federal \nstatute, Alaska school districts constitute an \"arm of the State\" but not the \"State\" itself). As \nthe State is not itself the potential employer for the Plaintiffs in this case, we do not believe \nthat the CBEST should be characterized as an employment exam. \nb. The CBEST Is A Valid Licensing Exam Because The \nCBEST Is Required Under the State's Police Power \nand Not Its Proprietary Power \nThe question still remains whether the CBEST is a valid licensing exam. The District Court \nwas of course cognizant of the fact that the school districts are the direct employers, and \nnot the State. AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1550. Nevertheless, the District Court found that \nthe 1071*1071 CBEST was not a licensing exam because it focused solely on public \nemployees and not private employees. Id. at 1550. \nWe agree with the District Court that the limitation of the examination to public school \nteachers raises a question as to whether it is a true licensing exam. Nevertheless, we do \nnot think that such a limitation is necessarily dispositive. Although previous federal courts to \nuphold teacher licensing exams have not discussed the consequences of the fact that such \nexams were restricted to public employees, see e.g., Fields v. Hallsville Indep. Sch. \nDist., 906 F.2d 1017 (5th Cir.1990),[14] we think that the critical issue is whether the State is \nexercising its police powers or its proprietary powers.[15] The clear principle behind the \nlicensing exception is that a State will not be liable under Title VII for \"interference\" with an \nemployment relationship if the alleged interference is an exercise of its regulatory \nresponsibilities. See e.g., George v. New Jersey Bd. of Veterinary Medical Exam'rs, 794 \nF.2d 113, 114 (3rd Cir.1986) (holding that Title VII does not reach licensing under police \npowers of a state). \nAlthough a limitation of an examination to public employees will inevitably raise the question \nof whether the State is exercising its proprietary power, it does not inherently require such a \n \n\n \n \nconclusion. For example, imagine that the State were to conclude that criminal courts were \nfrequently convicting indigent citizens because their defense attorneys were insufficiently \nversed in the law of the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, imagine that the California \nLegislature were to pass a law addressed to this problem, requiring that all attorneys \nemployed by public defender offices of the various cities or counties in California were \nrequired to pass an exam on the Fourth Amendment as a condition of employment. \nWe think that such an exam would be an exercise of the State's police power, and would \ntherefore be a valid licensing exam despite the fact that it was not extended to private \ncriminal defense attorneys. At least two factors would support such a conclusion. First, we \nwould consider the fact that the requirements extend beyond State employees to all similar \nprofessionals in any public agency to be evidence that the State is employing its police \npower. Second, we would consider the fact that this requirement was mandated by the \nLegislature (rather than by an administrator responsible for managing the positions at issue) \nas providing additional evidence that the State is acting in its sovereign capacity rather than \nits proprietary capacity. \n1072*1072 Returning to the CBEST exam, we think this is a very close question. \nNevertheless, we think that the State is exercising its police powers and not its proprietary \npowers when it requires that public school teachers be certificated employees. First, \nalthough the public schools are instrumentalities of the State under California law, California \nlaw establishes that teachers are not State employees. Gonzales v. State of California, 29 \nCal.App.3d 585, 590-91, 105 Cal.Rptr. 804 (1972). Second, the CBEST was mandated by \nthe Legislature and not an administrator or administrative agency responsible for \noverseeing the employees at issue. Although these factors are not necessarily dispositive, \nwe find in this case that they tip the balance in favor of the Defendants. See generally Fields \nv. Hallsville Indep. Sch. Dist., 906 F.2d 1017, 1020 (5th Cir.1990) (holding that Texas \nteacher's exam did not make State of Texas into an employer and rejecting claim that the \nState of Texas was subject to Title VII liability for any effect of exam). \nThe District Court found that the CBEST was not a valid licensing exam, and that as such it \nconstituted an actionable interference with the employment relationship. AMAE I, 836 \nF.Supp. at 1551 (citing Sibley Mem. Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir.1973)). As we \nconclude that it is a valid licensing exam, and therefore exempt from liability under Title VII, \nwe need not decide whether Sibley would otherwise apply to this situation.[16] \nIn sum, we conclude that Title VII does not apply to either the State of California or the CTC \nas their actions relate to the licensing of public school teachers in the State of California. \nD. The District Court's Findings That the Test Was \nDiscriminatory \nAlthough our conclusion that Title VI and Title VII do not apply to the CBEST could resolve \nthe case, we have reviewed the District Court's factual findings in response to Plaintiffs' \nAppeal and we find no reversible error in those factual findings. As such, we approve the \n \n\n \n \nDistrict Court's factual findings as an alternative ground on which we affirm the District \nCourt's judgment.[17] \n1. General Requirement of Test Validation \n\"Discriminatory tests are impermissible unless shown, by professionally acceptable \nmethods, to be predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of work \nbehavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being \nevaluated.\" Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 431, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d \n280 (1975). In evaluating tests under Title VII that allegedly have a disparate racial impact, \nwe apply a burden-shifting approach. In the first step of the approach, the plaintiff must \nestablish a prima facie case by demonstrating that the test causes a disparate impact on \nthe basis of race. If the plaintiff makes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant \nto demonstrate that the test was properly \"validated\" to be \"job related for the position in \nquestion and consistent with business necessity.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2k(1)(A)(i); see \nalso Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 425.[18] \n1073*1073 The District Court found that Plaintiffs met their burden of proving that the CBEST \nhas a disparate impact on the plaintiff class. AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. 1397, 1403 \n(N.D.Cal.1996), and this finding is not challenged on appeal. Proceeding to validation, the \nDistrict Court found that Defendants had successfully rebutted the prima facie case. The \nDistrict Court found that the CBEST had been properly validated in three studies: (1) the \n1982 Wheeler & Elias study, (2) the 1985 Practitioner's Review, and (3) the 1995 Lundquist \nstudy.[19] Plaintiffs is their appeal challenge this finding by the District Court that the CBEST \nwas properly validated. \nSteps to Validate Employment Criteria: As we have previously explained, the validation of \nan employment criteria involves a three-step process: \nThe employer must first specify the particular trait or characteristic which the selection \ndevice is being used to identify or measure. The employer must then determine that that \nparticular trait or characteristic is an important element of work behavior. Finally, the \nemployer must demonstrate by \"professionally acceptable methods\" that the selection \ndevice is \"predictive of or significantly correlated\" with the element of work behavior \nidentified in the second step. \nCraig v. County of Los Angeles, 626 F.2d 659, 662 (9th Cir.1980) (quoting Albemarle \nPaper, 422 U.S. at 431, 95 S.Ct. 2362). Subsequently in Clady, we endorsed a slightly \ndifferent test for determining whether a disparate impact defendant has satisfied the burden \nof showing job relatedness: \nThis circuit has held that the employer's burden is satisfied by showing \"by professionally \nacceptable methods\" that the test is \"predictive of or significantly correlated with important \nelements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which \ncandidates are being evaluated.\" \n \n\n \n \nClady v. County of Los Angeles, 770 F.2d 1421, 1430 (9th Cir.1985) (as amended) \n(quoting Contreras v. City of Los Angeles, 656 F.2d 1267, 1280 (9th Cir.1981)). \nUniform Guidelines and Content Validation: Both the District Court and the parties measure \nthe defendants' test validation procedures against the EEOC's Uniform Guidelines on \nEmployee Selection Procedures (\"Uniform Guidelines\").[20] The Uniform Guidelines \"are not \nlegally binding. They have not been promulgated as regulations and do not have the force \nof law.\" Clady, 770 F.2d at 1428 (citation omitted). Nevertheless, they are \"entitled to great \ndeference.\" Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 431, 95 S.Ct. 2362 (quoting Griggs v. Duke \nPower Co., 401 U.S. 424, 434, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971)). We have previously \nheld that \"while noncompliance [with the Uniform Guidelines] is not necessarily fatal, it \ndiminishes the probative value of the defendants' validation study.\" Clady, 770 F.2d at \n1430 (internal quotations omitted). \nThe Uniform Guidelines describe and approve three alternative methods of validating \nemployment tests: 1) content validity studies; 2) criterion-related validity studies; and 3) \nconstruct validation studies.[21] The District Court evaluated the 1074*1074 CBEST validation \nstudies as \"content validity\" studies, so we turn to the requirements of a content validity. \nContent validation establishes whether the content of a test closely approximates the tasks \nto be performed on the job by the applicant.[22] \"Evidence of the validity of a test or other \nselection procedure by a content validation study should consist of data showing that the \ncontent of the selection procedure is representative of important aspects of performance on \nthe job for which the candidates are to be evaluated.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1607.5(B). \n2. CBEST Test Validation Studies \na. Job Relatedness \nPlaintiffs contend that the two pre-litigation studies of the CBEST, the 1982 Wheeler & Elias \nstudy and the 1985 Practitioner's Review study, failed to undertake any job analyses to \nidentify work behaviors or job duties and thus could not have determined by \"professionally \nacceptable methods\" whether the CBEST is \"predictive of or significantly correlated\" to any \njob related duties. Plaintiffs also challenge the skills identified in the 1995 Lundquist study, \narguing that Dr. Lundquist erred in her methods for distinguishing skills which are \n\"important\" or \"critical\" from those which are neither. In a detailed and carefully reasoned \nopinion, the District Court found that all three studies adequately validated the CBEST. As \nwe uphold the District Court's findings for the 1985 Practitioner's Review and the 1995 \nLundquist study, we need focus only upon those two studies and we do not need to address \nthe 1982 Wheeler & Elias study.[23] \nThe 1985 Practitioners' Review \nThe Practitioners' Review was conducted by Dr. Richard Watkins in 1985. The District Court \nfound that \"the Practitioners' Review in 1985 involved the `pooled judgments of informed \n \n\n \n \npersons such as . . . job incumbents' about the relevance of the skills tested on the CBEST \nto the jobs for which it is required, an appropriate form of job analysis under the professional \nstandards of the time.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1419. \nThe Practitioners' Review polled \"234 teachers, administrators, teacher educators, and \nother school employees,\" thirty-six percent of whom were members of minority \ngroups. AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1413. \"The participants took part in nine review panels, in \nwhich they judged the relevance of both the skills assessed by the CBEST and the test \nitems themselves.\" Id. The educators were asked to rate the importance of \"skills\" according \nto fairly broad categories. For example, the three CBEST reading skills categories are: \n\"literal comprehension,\" \"logical comprehension,\" and \"critical comprehension.\" In \nmathematics, the three CBEST skills are \"problem solving skills,\" \"applied problem \nsolution,\" and \"concepts and relationships.\" Id. Educators were asked to rate how relevant \neach of the skills tested would be to four jobs: a) elementary school teachers, b) secondary \nschool teachers, c) pupil personnel and librarians, and d) school administrators. Id. These \nratings ranged from \"not relevant\" to \"very relevant.\" Id. \nThe Practitioner's Review thus took steps to learn from teachers and administrators which \ncategories of skills they 1075*1075 would identify as relevant to their jobs. Moreover, \nalthough such steps might have run a risk of identifying skills at too abstract a level, the \ncategories were defined in detail on the forms which panel members used to rate the \ncategories. For example, the category \"Mathematical concepts and relationships\" was \ndefined as follows: \nQuestions in this category test the understanding of basic concepts, such as the meaning of \ncertain terms (area, for example), order among numbers, relationships shown by graphs, \nelementary probability, and the like. Questions in this category may be from arithmetic, \nalgebra, or elementary geometry. \nIt is true that the Practitioner's Review measured skills at a slightly higher level of \nabstraction than the Lundquist Study addressed below. Nevertheless, the educators who \nrated skill categories for job relevance were guided by the specific definitions provided for \neach category, and were instructed to rate the importance of the skills tested for teaching \nand non-teaching jobs. These steps are not clearly inadequate under the Craig test, that the \nemployer must \"first specify the particular trait or characteristic\" and \"then determine that \nthat particular trait or characteristic is an important element of work behavior.\" Craig, 626 \nF.2d at 662. Thus, the District Court did not clearly err when it found that the Practitioners' \nReview included \"an appropriate form of a job analysis under the professional standards of \nthe time.\" \n1995 Lundquist Study \nAs we noted above, Plaintiffs do not challenge Dr. Lundquist's methodology for identifying \njob-related skills. Plaintiffs do, however, challenge Dr. Lundquist's methods for \ndistinguishing skills that are \"important\" or \"critical\" from those which are neither. \n \n\n \n \nDr. Lundquist's validation study polled experts and interviewed and observed teachers to \ndevelop a list of 59 activities, 39 reading skills, 27 writing skills, and 37 math skills used by \nteachers. AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1414. Dr. Lundquist then surveyed 1,100 teachers and \n230 administrators, asking each to rate the importance of those skills and activities on a \nfour-point scale from 0 (\"not applicable\") to 3 (\"critical\"). Id.[24] Skills and activities were \nretained only if \"at least 80 percent of the survey respondents rated the activity or skill as \napplicable to the job and the mean importance rating was 1.5 or higher on the importance \nscale.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1414-15. Applying that standard led to the elimination of \nseveral job activities and skills, including 21 of 37 math skills. \nPlaintiffs focus on the fact that skills were retained with only a mean rating of 1.5 on a scale \nthat designated 1 as \"minor\" and 2 as \"important.\" Plaintiffs contend that using the rating of \n1.5 thereby retained teacher skills and activities that are less important. The plaintiffs argue \nthat, as a result, the Lundquist study violated the command reflected by Craig and by the \nUniform Guidelines that only important or critical skills be tested. \nThe District Court disagreed with Plaintiffs, finding that \"Dr. Lundquist's decisions reflect \nmanifestly reasonable professional judgments. . . . With respect to the 1.5 mean, as Dr. \nLundquist testified at trial, a 1.5 rating rounds up to 2.0. It must be remembered that the \nmean rating of 1.5 was coupled with an 80 percent endorsement criterion, which is quite \nstringent.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1418 n. 35. \nWe admit that it is possible to conjure up a scenario that illustrates the plaintiffs' concern. \nAssume, for example, that 80% of the teachers surveyed agreed that the skill of solving \nquadratic equations (\"skill QE\") is \"relevant\" to the job of teaching, but that 75% of those \nsurveyed rated the importance of skill QE as only minor. If the remaining 25% rated the skill \nas \"critical,\" the mean importance rating of skill QE would be calculated as 1.5 and \ntherefore 1076*1076 skill QE would be retained despite the fact that three-quarters of the \neducators considered it of minor importance. However, although this scenario is possible, it \nis clearly an extreme case and demonstrates that only under anomalous circumstances \nwould an outlying question find its way into the CBEST. Plaintiffs have provided no \nevidence that any such outlying questions did, in fact, make its way into the CBEST.[25] \nIn sum, although Dr. Lunquist's methodology is not free of any possible error, the mere \npossibility of error does not demonstrate that the District Court's findings were clearly \nerroneous. As we have previously observed, validation studies \"are by their nature difficult, \nexpensive, time consuming and rarely, if ever, free of error.\" Cleghorn v. Herrington, 813 \nF.2d 992, 996 (9th Cir.1987). Plaintiffs' challenge rests on the theoretical possibility that \nerror could have existed in the writing and reading sections, and no such error has been \nshown. We conclude that the District Court did not commit clear error in upholding Dr. \nLundquist's content validation study despite its possible retention of slightly less \"important\" \nskills on the reading or writing portions of the exam. \nb. Job-Specific Validation \n \n\n \n \nTitle VII requires that a defendant using a test with a racially disparate adverse impact \ndemonstrate that the test is \"job related for the position in question.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(k)(1)(A)(i). The Uniform Guidelines provide that \"[a]ny validity study should be based upon \na review of information about the job for which the selection procedure is to be used.\" 29 \nC.F.R. § 1607.14(A). \nThe 1985 Practitioners' Study \nThe 1985 study defined the jobs it sought to analyze as 1) elementary school teachers, 2) \nsecondary school teachers, 3) librarians and pupil personnel (counselors and attendance \nofficers), and 4) school administrators. All panel members were asked to judge the \nrelevance of the CBEST skills by category for those jobs, ranking them from \"not relevant\" \nto \"very relevant.\" Although one might argue that the job classifications were too broad, we \nnote that teachers are not infrequently called upon to teach outside of their area of primary \nexpertise. As such, we cannot conclude that the District Court clearly erred in finding the job \nanalysis in the Practitioners' Review to be sufficiently particularized. \n1995 Lundquist Study \nDr. Lundquist identified teachers' job activities through several means, including literature \nreviews, observation of teachers on the job, and interviews with teachers regarding their \n\"job activities, their use of reading, writing, and mathematics skills, and other knowledge, \nskills and abilities used on the job.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1414. The Lundquist study \nbegan with an initial list of 103 specific reading, writing, and mathematics skills. From that \nlist Lundquist created a survey in which 1,100 educators ranked the relevance and \nimportance of those skills to the job of teaching. According to the District Court, \"[a] version \nof those survey for administrators was also created to determine whether 1077*1077 they \nshared a common set of skill requirements with classroom teachers. . . . Based on her \ncomparisons of teachers' and administrators' responses, Dr. Lundquist concluded that `all of \nthe skills identified as important for teachers were also important for administrators.'\" Id. at \n1414-15. \nDr. Lundquist's study reports: \nBasic skill ratings were examined for administrators to determine if the same skill sets \napplied to both teacher and administrator jobs. Results showed all but one skill item (a math \nitem) retained for teachers also applied to the administrator group. Thus the basic skill \nrequirements identified for teachers were found to be job-related for administrators as well, \nand the same test specifications may be used to test basic skills for teachers and \nadministrators. \nDr. Lundquist classified jobs as either \"teacher\" or \"administrator\" and determined that the \nCBEST, validated for teachers, was also valid for administrative positions. The District Court \naccepted this validation, concluding that \"the CBEST has been adequately validated with \n \n\n \n \nrespect to non-teaching jobs.\" Id. at 1418. Reviewing the record, we find no clear error in \nthat conclusion and we therefore uphold it. \nc. Actual Measurement of Skills \nPlaintiffs contend that no study has shown that the CBEST actually measures the job skills \nit purports to measure. \"[T]he employer must demonstrate by `professionally acceptable \nmethods' that the selection device is `predictive of or significantly correlated' with the \nelement of work behavior identified [by the job analysis].\" Craig, 626 F.2d at \n662 (quoting Albemarle Paper Co., 422 U.S. at 431). Plaintiffs claim that the District Court \nmerely accepted the facial validity of the CBEST without any evidence in support when it \nconcluded that the CBEST has been shown to be a valid measure of the basic skills tested. \nThe District Court did not explain the basis for its findings but unambiguously concluded that \n\"the CBEST actually measures . . . basic skills [in reading, writing, and mathematics]\" and \nrepeated later that \"the skills tested on the CBEST are jobrelated, and that the CBEST has \nbeen shown to be a valid measure of those basic skills.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1411, \n1419. \nIn Contreras, this Court held that \"a key requirement of [the] third step [of Craig], a \nrequirement essential to the proof of job relatedness generally, is that the validation method \nbe professionally acceptable.\" 656 F.2d at 1282. There is evidence in the record from \nexperts in the field to support the District Court's conclusions. Dr. William A. Mehrens, \nwhose writings on test validity issues include a section titled \"Writing and validating the \nitem\" reported that: \nETS personnel wrote some of the original items and assisted the test development \ncommittees in writing other items. ETS is well known and respected as a developer of \nstandardized tests. They have well trained item writers and an impressive internal set of \nguidelines they follow with respect to item writing. \nAsked whether \"the CBEST development [was] appropriate with respect to writing and \nevaluating the items,\" Dr. Mehrens testified: \nIt has been. Many of the items came from an existing ETS pool. Others \"were written \nspecifically for CBEST by members of the test development committee in concert with ETS \ntest development specialists.\" The individuals on the committees \n\"worked with specialists from ETS to further develop and define the content specifications, \nto review an existing ETS test item pool, to write new test items, and to review the items \nsubmitted by fellow committee members. In addition, the committees studied all of the data \nfrom the field testing, made recommendations for revisions as they felt 1078*1078 necessary, \nand reviewed all of the final test results.\" \n(citations omitted). \n \n\n \n \nEven if the test items are expertly developed, they still need to be matched to skills shown \nto be important to the job via a job analysis. The District Court described the \"Curriculum \nMatching project, in which two ETS employees . . . matched CBEST test specifications to \nmaterial found in textbooks purportedly used in California public schools.\" AMAE II, 937 \nF.Supp. at 1412 n. 21. The District Court criticized the study as \"unscientific\" and \"not \nparticularly helpful\" but noted that \"the study did support the overall conclusion that the \nkinds of skills tested on the CBEST can be found in elementary and secondary school \ntextbooks.\" Id. \nBecause there was some evidence that the CBEST development was appropriate with \nrespect to writing and evaluating the items, the District Court did not clearly err in finding \nthat the test items had been shown by professionally acceptable methods to be predictive of \nor significantly correlated with elements of work behavior. \nd. Passing Score Standards \nThe Uniform Guidelines provide: \"Where cutoff scores are used, they should normally be \nset so as to be reasonable and consistent with normal expectations of acceptable \nproficiency within the work force.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1607.5(H). We have previously applied that \nstandard in our own cases. See e.g., Craig, 626 F.2d at 665 (upholding a passing score \ncutoff as \"reasonable and consistent with normal expectations of performance in the . . . \nprogram\"). \nCourts reviewing cutoff scores on exams with a disparate impact frequently quote from a \nthorough discussion that appears in the Second Circuit's decision in Guardians Ass'n of \nNew York City Police Dept., Inc. v. Civil Service Commission of City of New York, 630 F.2d \n79, 105 (2d Cir.1980): \nWhen a cutoff score unrelated to job performance produces disparate racial results, Title VII \nis violated. Consequently, there should generally be some independent basis for choosing \nthe cutoff. . . . [A] criterion-related study is not necessarily required; the employer might \nestablish a valid cutoff score by using a professional estimate of the requisite ability levels, \nor, at the very least, by analyzing the test results to locate a logical \"break-point\" in the \ndistribution of scores. \n(internal citations omitted). \nIn Guardians, the Second Circuit rejected a cutoff score when the employer \"merely chose \nas many candidates as it needed, and then set the cutoff score so that the remaining \ncandidates would fail.\" Id. The cutoff was derived solely from the employer's staffing needs, \nwithout any reference to the job requirements. \nPlaintiffs allege that the District Court erred in upholding a twelve-of-sixteen cutoff score on \nthe reading component of the CBEST when an empirical study demonstrates that the \nproper, job-related passing score on the CBEST writing sub-test is nine or ten. \n \n\n \n \nThe District Court concluded that \"the passing scores on the CBEST reflect reasonable \njudgments about the minimum level of basic skills competence that should be required of \nteachers.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1420. The District Court described in detail the process \nused to develop passing score cutoffs for the original CBEST. The District Court found that \nthen-California Superintendent of Education Bill Honig, who had the ultimate responsibility \nfor setting the score cutoffs, \"had before him the results of the Wheeler and Elias study, the \nresults of the field test, and the recommendations of the [Commission] and the [CBEST] \nAdvisory Board.\" Id. at 1421. \nSuperintendent \"Honig testified that he did consider both the results of the Wheeler and \nElias study and the [Commission]'s advice when he made his decision, though he ultimately \ndisagreed with both recommendations.\" Id. at 1422. The data show 1079*1079 that almost \ntwenty percent of educators polled either thought a score of eleven-out-of-sixteen was not \npassing or were not certain. The Superintendent located a logical breaking point based \nupon professional estimates when he established the bottom passing score at twelve out of \nsixteen instead, which all readers agreed was a passing score. In the terminology \nof Guardians, the Superintendent concluded that twelve of sixteen was a \"logical break \npoint.\" As such, District Court did not clearly err in finding Superintendent Honig's score \ncutoffs were reasonable. \nE. The District Court's Appointment of a Technical \nAdvisor \nPlaintiffs claim that the trial court's rulings were procedurally tainted by the \"unreported \ninfluence of Dr. Stephen Klein,\" a RAND Corporation scientist who advised the District \nCourt through ex parte communications with the judge but was not appointed by the court \nas an expert witness, was not subject to cross-examination, and did not supply an expert's \nreport. \nAccording to the Order Appointing Technical Advisor, the District Court appointed Dr. Klein \nas a technical advisor, not as an expert witness. Courts have inherent authority to appoint \ntechnical advisors, although \"such appointments should be the exception and not the rule, \nand should be reserved for truly extraordinary cases where the introduction of outside skills \nand expertise, not possess by the judge, will hasten . . . just adjudication.\" Reilly v. United \nStates, 863 F.2d 149, 156 (1st Cir.1988). Recently, in General Electric Co. v. Joiner, Justice \nBreyer wrote separately to endorse such a practice: \nI therefore want specially to note that, as cases presenting significant science-related issues \nhave increased in number . . . judges have increasingly found in the Rules of Evidence and \nCivil Procedure ways to help them overcome the inherent difficulty of making determinations \nabout complicated scientific or otherwise technical evidence. Among these techniques are . \n. . the appointment of special masters and specially trained law clerks. \n522 U.S. 136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 520, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring). \n \n\n \n \nThis case involves the highly technical field of psychometrics, and presents problems of \nunusual complexity beyond the normal questions of fact and law with which judges routinely \ngrapple. Under the approach identified by Justice Breyer and applied by the First Circuit \nin Reilly, this case is a fitting case for the use of a technical advisor. The District Court \ninvited the parties to object to Dr. Klein's appointment and plaintiffs did not do so. \nThe District Court advised the parties that, consistent with its usual practice, it expected to \nput Dr. Klein on the stand towards the end of the trial, ask him his views, and permit the \nparties to cross-examine him. Had the District Court done so, Dr. Klein would have become \nan expert witness and his testimony would therefore have become a part of the evidence \nconsidered by the Court in its role as the finder of fact. In addition, under Fed.R.Evid. \n706(a), the parties could have cross-examined Dr. Klein as a matter of right to test this \nevidence. \nHowever, the District Court did not call Dr. Klein, and there is no evidence that the District \nCourt relied on Dr. Klein's opinions as a source of evidence. To the extent that the District \nCourt relied on Dr. Klein to assist the Court in understanding the evidence submitted by the \nparties, Dr. Klein remained within the role of a technical advisor as defined in Reilly, similar \nto the role of a specialized law clerk.[26] Because Rule 706 does not apply to technical \nadvisors, Reilly, 863 F.2d at 1080*1080 155, the District Court no more erred in refusing \ncross examination of Dr. Klein than it would have erred in refusing cross examination of its \nlaw clerks. Likewise, the District Court did not err in not requiring that Dr. Klein furnish an \nexpert's report. \nF. The District Court's Denial of Costs to the \nDefendants \n1. This Court Reviews the Denial of Costs For An \nAbuse of Discretion \nPursuant to Rule 54(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"costs shall be allowed \nas a matter of course to the prevailing party unless the court directs otherwise.\" F.R.C.P. \n54(d)(1). Rule 54 thus creates a presumption in favor of awarding costs to the prevailing \nparty. National Info. Servs., Inc. v. TRW, 51 F.3d 1470, 1471 (9th Cir.1995). The District \nCourt's denial of costs is reviewed by this Court for an abuse of discretion. United States ex \nrel. Newsham v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., Inc., 171 F.3d 1208, 1213 (9th Cir.1999). \n2. The District Court Abused Its Discretion When It \nEntirely Denied Costs to the Defendants \nAlthough the decision to award costs resides within the discretion of the district court, a \ncourt \"generally must award costs unless the prevailing party is guilty of some fault, \nmisconduct, or default worthy of punishment.\" National Info. Servs., 51 F.3d at 1472. \n \n\n \n \nIn this case, the District Court explicitly found that the Defendants had not committed any \nmisconduct that would require a denial of costs. Order filed Feb. 12, 1997 at ¶ 2 (\"Order\"). \nNevertheless, the District Court observed that our holding that a court \"generally must \naward costs\" implied that there were exceptional cases in which the court might deny \ncosts. Id. (Emphasis added in original Order). In this case, the District Court found that the \nsuit involved an issue of substantial public importance, that the issues were reasonably \nclose and difficult, and that there was some merit to the Plaintiffs' case. Order, ¶¶ 3-4, 6-7. \nThe District Court also noted the substantial disparity of resources between the resources of \nthe parties. Order, ¶ 5 (citing National Org. for Women v. Bank of California, 680 F.2d 1291, \n1294 (9th Cir.1982) and Moore v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., 708 F.2d 475, 478 (9th \nCir.1983)). On this basis, the District Court concluded that it was within its discretion to \ncompletely deny costs to Defendants, and thereupon did so. Order, ¶ 8. \nWe agree with the District Court that our precedent allows a court to consider the limited \nresources of a Title VII plaintiff when assessing costs. Moore, 708 F.2d at 478; Wrighten v. \nMetropolitan Hosp., Inc., 726 F.2d 1346, 1358 (9th Cir.1984). However, these precedents \nmust be read in light of our more recent decision in National Info. Servs. We held in National \nInfo. Servs. that the denial of costs is \"by nature a penalty,\" 51 F.3d at 1472, and that such \npunitive measures cannot be imposed absent wrong-doing because \"a district court cannot \npunish a party by denying costs unless the party has done something to deserve \nit.\" Id. Congress has included nothing in the language of Title VII that would justify the \nimposition of such a penalty on an exonerated defendant. As a consequence, we conclude \nthat a court may consider the limited resources of a Title VII plaintiff, but may not entirely \ndeny costs to a prevailing defendant as a result. \nWe also conclude that there is no exception to Rule 54(d) that entitles a court to punish a \ndefendant simply because the case involves an issue of national importance. The District \nCourt relied heavily upon a sliver of language contained in two Seventh Circuit cases, which \nboth mentioned \"landmark cases of national importance.\" Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. \nColbert, 692 F.2d 489, 490 (7th Cir.1982) and Popeil Bros., Inc. v. Schick Elec., Inc., 516 \nF.2d 772, 776 (7th Cir.1975). However, 1081*1081 neither case suggested that an exception \nto Rule 54(d) in fact existed for landmark cases; rather, both cases expressly declined to \nconsider the possibility of such an exception because neither case could have been \nconsidered a landmark case of national importance. Delta Air Lines, 692 F.2d at 490; Popeil \nBros., 516 F.2d at 776. One could not even characterize as dicta the Seventh Circuit's \nposition on this point, because the Seventh Circuit simply has not expressed any opinion. \nTurning to our own cases and to the text of Rule 54(d), we find nothing that would support \nsuch an exception, and we explicitly hold today that there is no such general exception to \nRule 54(d) beyond the exception for civil rights plaintiffs.[27] \nTurning to the District Court's remaining grounds for the denial of costs, we observe \nthat National Info. Servs. specifically rejected the denial of costs on the basis that the \nplaintiff's position had \"`merit.'\" National Info. Servs., 51 F.3d at 1471. It also specifically \nheld that \"`difficulty' alone does not justify penalizing the prevailing parties.\" Id. at 1473. \nThese factors should not be considered in the assessment of costs and it was an abuse of \ndiscretion for the District Court to consider those factors. \n \n\n \n \nFinally, none of the precedents relied upon by the District Court involved the complete \ndenial of costs to a prevailing party,[28] and to the extent that they might suggest a complete \ndenial of costs, such a suggestion would not survive our holding in National Info. Servs. As \nwith the defendants in National Info. Servs., \"there is no impropriety on the part of the \ndefendants in this case that would justify denying them their due costs under Rule \n54(d)(1).\" Id. We therefore remand the case to the District Court for a determination of the \nproper costs. \nIII. Conclusion \nFor the reasons discussed above, we deny Plaintiffs' Appeal, and we grant Defendants' \nAppeal. The Judgment of the District Court in favor of the Defendants is AFFIRMED, but the \ncase is remanded to the District Court for a determination of the proper costs in light of our \ndiscussion. \nBOOCHEVER, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nThe majority opinion holds that the CBest examination is not subject to Title VII because the \nCBest is a licensing exam. Because I believe that the majority's holding rests on the \nmistaken conclusion of law that Title VII does not apply to the CBest simply because it is a \nlicensing exam, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion which holds that the \nCBest is 1082*1082 not subject to Title VII.[1] Because the majority holds that neither Title VI \nnor Title VII applies, I see no reason for dictum concerning the merits of the contention that \nthe CBest violated Title VI and Title VII. \nI \nThe majority characterizes the \"critical issue\" in this case as \"whether the State is exercising \nits police powers or proprietary powers.\" Majority Opinion at 1071. If the CBest is an \nexercise of the State's police powers, the majority states, then the CBest would be a \nlicensing exam and therefore exempt from Title VII liability. See id. at 1071. Ignoring for the \nmoment the wisdom of relying on a standard as uncertain as the \"police/proprietary power\" \nstandard offered by the majority, I believe that framing the issue in these terms is incorrect \nas a matter of law. \nTitle VII provides in pertinent part that \"[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an \nemployer . . . to fail or refuse to hire . . . any individual . . . because of such individual's race, \ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Title VII governs the \nrelationship between employers and employees; it does not speak to any exceptions for \ngovernmental licensing activities or exercises of the State's police power. Under Title VII, \nthe only issue we need examine is whether an employer has \"fail[ed] or refuse[d] to hire any \nindividual because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" Id. Thus, \nif the State as employer administers a test to its potential employees as a condition of \nemployment, the exam would be subject to Title VII notwithstanding its being called a \nlicensing exam or characterized as an exercise of the State's police power.[2] \n \n\n \n \nI would agree with the majority that in most cases, courts have found that Title VII did not \napply to a governmental licensing agency. See George v. New Jersey Bd. of Veterinary \nMed. Exam'rs., 794 F.2d 113, 114 (3d Cir.1986); Haddock v. Bd. of Dental Exam'rs., 777 \nF.2d 462, 463-64 (9th Cir.1985); Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exam'rs., 598 F.2d 1345, \n1346 (4th Cir.1979) (per curiam); but see Puntolillo v. New Hampshire Racing Comm'n, 375 \nF.Supp. 1089, 1092 (D.N.H.1974) (holding that a state agency that licensed race horse \ndrivers was an employer of the drivers where the agency allegedly interfered with their \nemployment by race track owners). The result of the George, Haddock and Woodard cases \nshould not be surprising, however, because in those cases, there was no employment \nrelationship between the licensing entity and employee, and the courts concluded that the \nlicensing entity was not an applicable \"employer\" under Title VII. In other words, the \nlicensing entity was not subject to Title VII for its activities because it lacked an employment \nrelationship with the employees, not because their activities could be characterized as \nlicensing activities. \nRather than focusing on the employment relationship, the majority's approach attempts to \ndetermine whether the State's action is an exercise of its police or \nproprietary 1083*1083 powers. Even assuming that such a framework is workable, and I do \nnot believe that it is, see, e.g., J.L. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 971 F.2d 260, 270 (9th \nCir.1992) (stating that such a framework \"would require courts to make unfamiliar and \npotentially unworkable threshold characterizations of agency actions as either proprietary or \nregulatory\"), framing the issue in these terms begs the question. Further, the majority's two-\nfactored test to distinguish a State's police and proprietary powers is of little help in this \ncase. \nIn any event, because licensing exams are not exempt from Title VII scrutiny, whether we \ndetermine that the CBest is an exercise of the State's police power and, according to the \nmajority opinion, \"therefore a valid licensing exam,\" is irrelevant. See Majority Opinion at \n1070-71. Under Title VII, our focus is whether an employer has \"fail[ed] or refuse[d] to hire \nany individual . . . because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\" It \nmakes no difference whether the failure or refusal to hire is based on the exercise of police \nor proprietary powers. \nII \nStill, the issue remains in this case whether the State may properly be characterized as the \nemployer of the public school teachers. While the employment relationships between the \nState and public school teachers are not direct ones, they are nevertheless strong, and I \nbelieve warrant treating the State as the teachers' employer under Title VII. The majority \nconcludes that California public school teachers are not the State's employees, and that the \nCBest is not an employment exam, because public teachers do not have a traditional \nemployment relationship with the State. Such a conclusion, however, does not end the \ninquiry under Title VII. As the majority rightfully concedes, a direct employment relationship \nis not a prerequisite for Title VII liability. See Majority Opinion at 1070 n. 13. \n \n\n \n \nThis Court has held that while \"there must be some connection with an employment \nrelationship for Title VII protections to apply . . . [t]he connection with employment need not \nnecessarily be direct.\" Lutcher v. Musicians Union Local 47, 633 F.2d 880, 883 (9th \nCir.1980) (footnotes omitted); see also Baker v. McNeil Island Corrections Ctr., 859 F.2d \n124, 127 (9th Cir.1988). Title VII \"`does not use the term \"employee.\" The phrase is, rather, \nthe \"person aggrieved;\" and that term can certainly be taken as comprehending individuals \nwho do not stand in a direct employment relationship with an employer.'\" Gomez v. Alexian \nBros. Hosp. of San Jose, 698 F.2d 1019, 1021 (9th Cir.1983) (per \ncuriam) (quoting Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1341). Such a reading is also consistent with liberally \ninterpreting the definition of \"employer\" in order to effectuate the remedial and public policy \ngoals of Title VII. See Virgo v. Riviera Beach Assoc., Ltd., 30 F.3d 1350, 1359 (11th \nCir.1994); Spencer v. General Elec. Co., 894 F.2d 651, 657 (4th Cir.1990), abrogated on \nother grounds, Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 \n(1992); Owens v. Rush, 636 F.2d 283, 287 (10th Cir.1980); Quijano v. Univ. Fed. Credit \nUnion, 617 F.2d 129, 131 (5th Cir.1980); Baker v. Stuart Broadcasting Co., 560 F.2d 389, \n391 (8th Cir.1977); Sibley Mem. Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338, 1340-41 (D.C.Cir.1973). \nI agree with the majority that the relationship between the State and local school districts is \nanalogous to the relationship between a corporate parent and its wholly owned subsidiary. I \ndisagree, however, with the majority's conclusion that a parent corporation would not be \nsubject to Title VII under the circumstances involved. This court has previously held that \n\"[i]n the absence of special circumstances, a parent corporation is not liable for the Title VII \nviolations of its wholly owned subsidiary.\" Watson v. Gulf and West. Indus., 650 F.2d 990, \n993 (9th Cir.1980) (emphasis added). In Watson, the plaintiff contended that both the parent \ncorporation, Gulf, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Paramount, were liable for Paramount's \nTitle VII violations. Id. Because there were no \"special circumstances\" 1084*1084 present, \nthe Watson court upheld the district court's grant of summary judgment to Gulf. In \nexplaining what might constitute \"special circumstances,\" however, the Watson court stated: \n\"[i]f there was any evidence that Gulf . . . participated in or influenced the employment \npolicies of Paramount, . . . then we would be presented with a very different \ncase.\" Id. (emphasis added). \nAlthough the majority recognized that a parent corporation might be liable under Title VII \ngiven the presence of such special circumstances, the majority expressly declined to \nconsider whether the State's heavy involvement in local school district's operations were \nsufficient to hold the State liable under Title VII. See Majority at 1070 n. 13. The majority \navoided this issue by concluding that the CBest is a licensing exam, and that Title VII does \nnot apply to governmental licensing activities. As demonstrated in the previous section, \nhowever, that conclusion is mistaken, and we must therefore determine whether the State \npossesses an employment relationship with public school teachers. Given the close \nregulatory control exercised by the State over all aspects of the operation of local school \ndistricts, including personnel policies, I conclude that under Title VII the State is an \nemployer of public school teachers.[3] \nSchool districts are agents of the State for the local operation of the common school \nsystem, see Hall v. City of Taft, 47 Cal.2d 177, 302 P.2d 574, 577 (1956), and under the \nCalifornia Constitution, the duty of educating the state's children falls squarely upon the \n \n\n \n \nState. See Cal. Const. Art. I, § 1. California courts have long recognized that \"public schools \n. . . are a matter of statewide rather than local or municipal concern; their establishment, \nregulation and operation are covered by the Constitution and the state Legislature is given \ncomprehensive powers in relation thereto.\" Hall, 302 P.2d at 576; see also San Francisco \nUnified Sch. Dist. v. Johnson, 3 Cal.3d 937, 92 Cal.Rptr. 309, 479 P.2d 669, 677 \n(1971); Johnson v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist., 217 Cal.App.3d 692, 266 Cal.Rptr. 187, \n191 (Cal.App.1990). \"The Constitution has always vested `plenary' power over education \nnot in the districts, but in the State, through its Legislature, which may create, dissolve, \ncombine, modify, and regulate local districts at pleasure.\" Butt v. State of California, 4 \nCal.4th 668, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d 1240, 1254 (1992). \"The local school district \nsystem of administration, although `recognized by the Constitution and deeply rooted in \ntradition, is not a constitutional mandate, but a legislative choice,'\" id. (citing Cal.Const., art. \nIX, §§ 6-1/2, 14), and it is clear that \"[t]he system of public schools . . . is `one system . . . \napplicable to all the common schools. . . .'\" Butt, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d at \n1248 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Kennedy v. Miller, 97 Cal. 429, 32 P. 558, 559 \n(Cal.1893)). Further, \"[u]nlike most states, California school districts have budgets that are \ncontrolled and funded by the state government rather than the local districts.\" See Belanger \nv. Madera Unified Sch. Dist., 963 F.2d 248, 251 (9th Cir.1992). This court has held that \ngiven this relationship, school districts enjoy the State's immunity 1085*1085 under the \nEleventh Amendment. Id. at 254. \nLocal school districts are bound by a multitude of State constitutional and statutory \nmandates. For example, the California Constitution \ncreates State and county educational offices, including a Superintendent of Public \nInstruction and a State Board of Education. It authorizes the formation of local school \ndistricts, requires that all public elementary and secondary schools be administered within \nthe Public School System, establishes a State School Fund, reserves a minimum portion of \nState revenues for allocation to the Fund, guarantees minimum allocations from the Fund \nfor each public school, specifies minimum salaries for public school teachers, authorizes the \nState Board of Education to approve public school textbooks, and permits the Legislature to \ngrant local districts such authority over their affairs as does not conflict with the laws and \npurposes for which school districts are established. \nButt, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d at 1248 (citations and quotations omitted). In addition, \nState statutes govern \nsuch matters as county and district organization, elections, and governance; educational \nprograms, instructional materials, and proficiency testing; sex discrimination and affirmative \naction; admission standards; compulsory attendance; school facilities; rights and \nresponsibilities of students and parents; holidays; school health, safety, and nutrition; \nteacher credentialing and certification; rights and duties of public school employees; and the \npension system for public school teachers. \nId. at 1254 (citations omitted). Finally, this statutory scheme is supported by \"voluminous \nregulations administered by the State's Department of Education and the [California \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction].\" Id. It is clear that even though local school districts \n \n\n \n \nare operated by officials who are locally elected and appointed, they are effectively \nextensions of the State in providing a constitutionally mandated public education to \nCalifornia children. The complex legal and functional relationship between the State and \nlocal school districts constitutes sufficient \"special circumstances\" to warrant holding the \nState liable as an employer of the public school teachers for the CBest, even without the \ndirect employment relationship otherwise required by the majority.[4] \nIn any event, it is clear that even without a direct employment relationship with the teachers, \nthe State would still be subject to Title VII as a covered employer if it discriminatorily \ninterferes with the employment opportunities of public teachers with local school \ndistricts. See Gomez, 698 F.2d at 1021; Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1341. The majority also \ndeclined to discuss this issue, again because the majority concluded that licensing exams \nare not subject to Title VII. See Majority Opinion at 1072. \nA sufficient relationship arises under Title VII where an entity, usually a labor union or \nemployment agency, is in a position to interfere with an applicant's employment \nopportunities with a third party, and does so. Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1341. In this case, the \nState regulates the credentials 1086*1086 necessary for public school employment. An \napplicant who does not adhere to the State's requirements is free to teach in private \nschools, but not in public schools. As Gomez stated, \nit would contravene Congress's intent in Title VII \"[t]o permit a covered employer to exploit \ncircumstances peculiarly affording it the capability of discriminatorily interfering with an \nindividual's employment opportunities with another employer, while it could not do so with \nrespect to employment in its own service. . . .\" \nGomez, 698 F.2d at 1021 (quoting Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1341). These circumstances certainly \nexist in the instant case. Only the state Legislature possesses the constitutional authority to \nregulate public school teacher hiring on a statewide level, such as by imposing a \ncredentialing requirement like the CBest, but under the majority opinion, the State is not \nsubject to Title VII because it is not a direct employer. On the other hand, local school \ndistricts, which are the direct employers, are not subject to Title VII because it is the State \nand CTC that require and administer the CBest. Given these circumstances, as a practical \nmatter, the majority's reading of Title VII leaves minority public school teachers without any \nof the protections afforded by Title VII to challenge a state-imposed employment practice \nsuch as the CBest. \"Congress expressly indicated the intent that the same Title VII \nprinciples be applied to governmental and private employers alike,\" Dothard v. \nRawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 331-32 n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977), and surely \ndid not intend to allow states so easily to circumvent Title VII's mandate. Thus, I would hold \nthe State subject to Title VII as a covered employer if it discriminatorily interferes with the \nemployment opportunities of public teachers with local school districts.[5] \nIn sum, because I believe that the CBest examination is subject to the provisions of Title VII, \nI would reach the merits of the plaintiffs' Title VII claims and determine whether the CBest \nwas properly validated. Because the majority concludes that Title VII does not apply, I do \nnot express any opinion whether the CBest, as validated by the three studies, violated Title \nVII. \n \n\n \n \nIII \n\"The objective of Congress in the enactment of Title VII is plain from the language of the \nstatute. It was to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that \nhave operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other \nemployees.\" Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 \n(1971). I do not believe that congressional intent is served by relying on a constrained \nreading of Title VII to avoid the application of that statute to statewide hiring requirements \nfor all public school teachers. \nAs a result of today's decision, California is no longer bound to follow Title VII's mandate \nwhen imposing its statewide hiring requirements for public school teachers, however \ninvidious, discriminatory, or harmful those requirements may be. In reaching its decision, \nthe majority ignores the political realities of public education in California and instead relies \non the non-dispositive observation that the relationship between the State and public school \nteachers is not a traditional one. Because I believe that the majority has diminished the \nprotections of Title VII for public school teachers beyond what Congress intended, I \nrespectfully dissent. \n IV \n1087*1087\nThe district court stated the following as its reasons for denying all costs: the suit involved \nan issue of substantial public importance; the issues were reasonably close and difficult; \nthat there was some merit to the plaintiffs' case; and there was a substantial disparity of \nresources between the parties. The majority holds that these reasons may not themselves \njustify the denial of all costs to the prevailing parties. When, however, there is the added \ncircumstance that awarding such high costs against a civil rights plaintiff may well have a \n\"chilling effect . . . on future civil rights litigants,\" Stanley v. Univ. of Southern California, slip \nop. at 5321, 1999 WL 346615 at *9 (9th Cir. June 2, 1999), I believe that it is within the \ndistrict court's discretion to deny all or a portion of the huge costs assessed in this case. \nI start with the acknowledged fact that the CBest resulted in the failure of a disproportionate \nnumber of minorities as compared to Caucasians. To challenge the State of California, with \nall of its resources, may well be daunting — a David facing Goliath — if in addition to the \nattorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing suit in such a complex matter, the plaintiffs \nmay be required to pay the defendants' costs, which in this case amount to $216,433.67. \nThe case primarily relied upon by the majority is not a civil rights case, but litigation between \nprivate corporations, where National Information Services, Inc., Credit Data of Illinois, Inc., \nInformative Research, Inc., and CDB Infotek all sued TRW, Inc. and Credit Bureau Reports, \nInc. for alleged antitrust violations. See Nat'l Info. Services, Inc. v. TRW, Inc., 51 F.3d 1470 \n(9th Cir.1995) (as amended). Under the circumstances there involved, where the litigation is \nbetween corporate entities, the failure to award costs to the prevailing party properly was \nconsidered an unjustified penalty. The appeal before us more closely involves the civil rights \nconsiderations set forth in Stanley. \n \n\n \n \nWhile I concur in the majority's decision to remand for a determination of the proper costs, I \nassume that the majority agrees that in making its determination of the proper amount of \ncosts, the district court in its discretion may consider whether there is a disparity of \nresources between the parties; the fact that this is civil rights litigation; the plaintiffs' partial \nsuccess in securing modification of the CBest; the possibility that the cost award would \nrender some or all of the plaintiffs indigent; the possibility that the cost award could chill \nfuture civil rights litigation, and any other appropriate factors. \nUnlike the majority, however, I would allow the district court, in exercising its broad \ndiscretion, to award zero costs if the balance of factors so warrant. This result is supported \nby Stanley. In Stanley, this court found that the award of costs by the district court was an \nabuse of discretion because the district court had failed to consider all of the proper factors, \nnamely the possibility that the cost award could render some or all of the plaintiffs indigent, \nor the possibility that the cost award could chill future civil rights litigation, and thus \nremanded the issue to the district court for reconsideration in light of those factors. If, on \nremand in this case, the district court properly considers the factors discussed above and \nthen determines that given those factors, the appropriate cost award is zero, then \nunder Stanley, I believe the district court would be acting within its discretion in awarding \nzero costs. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) provides in part that \"costs other than attorneys' \nfees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise \ndirects; . . .\" (emphasis added). The district court's power in an appropriate case to \n\"otherwise direct\" is not limited. Yet, the majority engages in engrafting on the rule a \nrequirement that \"in no event may the court direct that no costs be awarded.\" While in some \ncases it would certainly be an abuse of discretion 1088*1088 for a court to direct that no \ncosts be awarded a prevailing party, we should not attempt to restrict the discretion granted \nthe court so as to eliminate that possibility in all cases. Rule 54(d)(1) itself is broad enough \nto allow district court judges to deny all or a portion of the costs to the prevailing parties, and \nwe should only interfere when they abuse their discretion. Because I disagree that in a civil \nrights case, a district court necessarily abuses its discretion when it denies all costs to a \nprevailing party, I respectfully dissent from that part of the majority's holding. \n[*] The Honorable Stephen V. Wilson, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by \ndesignation. \n[1] The introduction and portions of the factual and procedural history were authored by Judge Boochever, and have \nbeen incorporated into this opinion with his permission. \n[2] The name of the CTPL was actually changed on January 1, 1983 to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing \n(\"CTC\"). AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1538. The CTC remained responsible for administering the test. Id. \n[3] The full provision reads: \nThe Public School System shall include all kindergarten schools, elementary schools, secondary schools, technical \nschools, and State colleges, established in accordance with law, and, in addition, the school districts and the other \nagencies authorized to maintain them.

Const., art. IX, § 6, ¶ 2. \n[4] Indeed, we believe that it is the only term to which any jurisprudence has attached. \n[5] We note that, despite the statute's suggestion that there is only one \"State educational agency,\" this Court has \npreviously found that different State departments and agencies can together constitute a \"State educational \nagency.\" Los Angeles Branch NAACP v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 714 F.2d 946, 951 (9th Cir.1983); see \nalso Upper Valley Ass'n for Handicapped Citizens v. Mills, 928 F.Supp. 429, 432 (D.Vt.1996) (holding that Vermont \nBoard of Education and Department of Education \"collectively constitute a State educational agency\"). \n[6] Even at the Constitutional level, the California State Constitution currently reflects the fact that school districts are \nthe primary administrative units for the schools. In 1972, California modified its State Constitution so that, while public \nschooling continued to be part of the \"Public School System,\" the Legislature was authorized \"to permit school \ndistricts `to initiate and carry on any programs, activities, or to otherwise act in any manner which is not in conflict with \nthe laws and purposes for which the school districts are established.'\" Hartzell v. Connell, 35 Cal.3d 899, 916, 201 \nCal.Rptr. 601, 679 P.2d 35 (1984) (quoting Cal. Const., art. IX, § 14). To the extent that the State Constitution before \n1972 might have been understood as requiring centralized control, it is clear that after 1972 the State Constitution \npermitted the school districts to exist as largely autonomous systems. Moreover, the Court notes that California's \nEducation Code § 35160, enacted in 1976, embodies the intent of article IX, § 14 and allows the school districts to \n\"initiate and carry on any program, activity or [ ] otherwise act in any manner which is not in conflict with . . . any law \nand which is not in conflict with the purposes for which school districts are established.\" Cal. Ed. Code § \n35160; Choice-In-Education League v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 17 Cal. App.4th 415, 423, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 303 \n(1993). \n[7] We note that we have previously concluded that the California State Board of Education and the California State \nDepartment of Education fall within the definition of \"State educational agency.\" Los Angeles Branch NAACP v. Los \nAngeles Unified Sch. Dist., 714 F.2d 946, 951 (9th Cir.1983). \n[8] We note that Congress selected the term \"local educational agency\" rather than the larger and more inclusive \nterm \"educational agency,\" which is defined to include both local educational agencies and \"`the state board of \neducation or other agency or officer primarily responsible for the state supervision of public elementary and \nsecondary schools.'\" Idaho Migrant Council v. Board of Educ., 647 F.2d 69, 71 (9th Cir.1981) (quoting 20 U.S.C. §§ \n1720(a), 881(k)). \n[9] Of course, whether or not an entity refers to itself as a \"school system\" may be a useful piece of evidence in \ndetermining whether or not the schools in that entity are closely enough linked to qualify as a \"school system\" for the \npurposes of § 2000d-4a(2)(B). However, while such a self-description would constitute evidence pointing in one \ndirection, it is not necessarily determinative on the question. \n[10] The Court notes that no House Report was submitted for this bill. The Senate Report is therefore the sole \nCongressional Report. \n[11] This is not to say that a State may not be the proper defendant under a Title VI suit. The plain language of Title \nVI demonstrates that a State agency or department may be covered by Title VI. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d-4a(1)(A-B). To \nthe extent that one would bring suit against the State for violations by such an agency or a department, the State \nwould be the proper defendant. \nAs a result, it is clear that an entity need not itself be a \"program or activity\" to be named as a defendant for Title \nVI. AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1541-43. This conclusion is confirmed within the statute by the structure of subsections \n3(A) and (B) of § 2000d-4a. Whereas subsection 3(A) provides for corporation-wide coverage when funding is \nextended to the corporation as a whole, subsection 3(B) limits the definition of \"program or activity\" to a particular \nplant or comparable facility when assistance is extended directly to the plant. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d-4a(3)(A) & (B). In \nthe later case, the \"program or activity\" would be limited to the plant, but the corporation would nevertheless be the \nproper defendant. For example, were a Ford plant in Dearborn, MI to receive federal funds, Title VI coverage would \nbe limited to the operations of the Dearborn plant and not thereby automatically extend to all of the Ford Motor \nCompany. Nevertheless, any victim of a Title VI violation under the plant-wide \"program or activity\" would file suit \n \n\n \n \nagainst the Ford Motor Company, which would be a proper defendant despite failing to qualify itself as a \"program or \nactivity.\" \nOur conclusion that the State as a whole is not subject to Title VI means only that receipt of federal funds by an \nagency of the State does not automatically extend Title VI coverage to the entire State government. Of course, the \nState may nevertheless be sued in the proper circumstances for a violation in a covered program or activity. \n[12] The District Court found that the CTPL (predecessor to the CTC) was created by the Legislature by statute, and \nthat the Governor appoints fifteen of the sixteen voting members of the Commission. AMAE I, 836 F.Supp. at 1538. \nMoreover, although the CTC is required to notify the Board of Education and the Superintendent of any proposed \npolicies and regulations, the CTC is not subject to the authority of either entity. Id. \n[13] We do note that a parent corporation may be liable under Title VII where it interferes with the employment \npractices of the subsidiary. Watson, 650 F.2d at 993. However, as we discuss below, we do not consider the CBEST \nto be the State's proprietary involvement with its \"subsidiary\" reviewable under Title VII but rather an exercise of its \nlicensing power, reviewable only under the Constitution. \n[14] In evaluating the Texas Exam for Current Administrators and Teachers (\"TECAT\"), the Fifth Circuit held that a \nstate requirement of the TECAT did not make the State of Texas into an employer and rejected a claim that the State \nof Texas was potentially subject to Title VII liability for any effect of the exam. Fields v. Hallsville Indep. Sch. \nDist., 906 F.2d 1017, 1020 (5th Cir.1990). Although the scope of the TECAT is not explicitly discussed in Fields, the \nteacher's exam upheld in Fields was required only for public school teachers. See State v. Project Principle, Inc., 724 \nS.W.2d 387, 389-90 (Tex.1987) (holding that the new requirement that existing Texas public school teachers pass \nthe TECAT constituted a licensing requirement and not a change in the contractual relationship between teachers \nand school districts). \n[15] The dissent questions the viability of the proprietary/regulatory distinction, citing J.L. v. Social Sec. Admin., 971 \nF.2d 260 (9th Cir.1992). While we did acknowledge in that case that \"[n]ot all actions may be so easily classified,\" we \nnevertheless went on to acknowledge that the dichotomy served a limited function. Id. at 272. In this case, we employ \nthe distinction in a very limited setting: Is a particular exam a licensing exam or a regulatory exam? This question can \nonly arise in a certification context where the State is not the employer. \nFinally, we would note that the distinction between proprietary and regulatory actions is a long established distinction, \nand we believe that the courts will be able to adequately distinguish between such functions. See generally Reeves, \nInc. v. Stake, 447 U.S. 429, 436, 100 S.Ct. 2271, 65 L.Ed.2d 244 (1980) (\"The basic distinction drawn in Alexandria \nScrap between States as market participants and States as market regulators makes good sense and sound law.\"). \n[16] We do note, of course, that the CBEST constitutes State action, and could be challenged were the CBEST to \nviolate Plaintiffs' Constitutional rights. There is, however, no allegation that the CBEST violates any Constitutional \nright. \n[17] The dissent argues that, having found Title VI and Title VII inapplicable, the remainder of our discussion on the \nmerits is merely dicta. However, our discussion is not dicta where, as here, it constitutes an alternative basis for our \ndecision. \"`[W]here a decision rests on two or more grounds, none can be relegated to the category of obiter \ndictum.'\" Export Group v. Reef Industries, Inc., 54 F.3d 1466, 1471 (9th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (quoting Woods v. \nInterstate Realty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 537, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949)); see also MacDonald, Sommer & \nFrates v. Yolo County, 477 U.S. 340, 346 n. 4, 106 S.Ct. 2561, 91 L.Ed.2d 285 (1986). \n[18] If the defendant establishes that the test is job-related, the burden would then shift back to the plaintiff to show \nthat other selection devices without a similar discriminatory effect would also \"serve the employer's legitimate interest \nin efficient and trustworthy workmanship.\" Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 425, 95 S.Ct. 2362 (internal quotations \nomitted). In the appeal before this Court, however, Plaintiffs challenge is limited to the validation, and we do not need \nto address whether other tests could achieve equivalent desirable results without any disparate impact. \n[19] The District Court's opinion provides a detailed background on the methodology used in each study, AMAE \nII, 937 F.Supp. at 1412-16, and we will not repeat that material here except where necessary to a particular issue in \nthe appeal. \n \n\n \n \n[20] The Uniform Guidelines were jointly adopted by the EEOC, the Civil Service Commission, the Department of \nLabor, and the Department of Justice in 1978, and are codified at 29 C.F.R. § 1607. They have remained unchanged \nsince that date. \n[21] The Uniform Guidelines do not preclude the use of other validation methods, but rather provide that \"[n]ew \nstrategies for showing the validity of selection procedures will be evaluated as they become accepted by the \npsychological profession.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1607.5(A). \n[22] The Uniform Guidelines used the term \"content\" to describe both the \"content of the job,\" 29 C.F.R. § \n1607.14(C)(1), and the \"content of the selection procedure.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1607.5(B). \n[23] We note that the 1982 study raised somewhat different questions than the latter two studies. We explicitly do not \nreach that study because the fact that the latter two studies survive this appeal makes the 1982 study redundant and \nrelieves us of the additional burden of evaluating the District Court's findings on that study. \n[24] The other two options were 1 (\"minor\") and 2 (\"important\"). \n[25] In addition, even if Dr. Lundquist's results were called into question by the initial retention of some skills that were \nslightly less \"important,\" the mathematics portion of her content validity study was saved by a subsequent step she \ntook. When faced with the prospect that 21 of the 37 math skills would be eliminated, the Commission engaged Dr. \nLundquist to conduct a focused content validity study on the math segment. Lundquist employed a panel of twenty \nteacher educators who conducted a fresh review of the 37 math skills. For a skill to be retained, 80 percent of the \npanel had to rate it as \"applicable and required at entry, and the skill had to have average and future importance \nratings equal to or greater than two (out of a three-point scale, one being `minor,' and three being `critical').\" AMAE \nII, 937 F.Supp. at 1416. Thus, on the math section, only skills rated \"important\" on average were retained. \n[26] Indeed, both Reilly and the District Court explicitly liken the role of a technical advisor to that of a law clerk. \n[27] Quite recently, we held that a district court abused its discretion by awarding especially high costs without \nconsidering that such high costs would render the civil rights plaintiff indigent. Stanley v. University of Southern \nCalifornia, 178 F.3d 1069 (9th Cir. 1999). We therefore remanded the case so that the district court could consider \nthe possibility of indigence and the effects of imposing \"such high costs\" on civil rights litigants. Id. at *9. \nStanley teaches that, in balancing the amount of costs to be awarded, a district court must consider the hardships \nthat extreme costs may impose on the people involved. These considerations will naturally vary from plaintiff to \nplaintiff, and financial burdens imposed on organizations may create less hardship than similar burdens imposed on \nnatural persons. This balancing will of course depend on the evidence of hardship presented to the district court. \nWe note only that our holding in Stanley does not eviscerate the holding of National Info. Servs. that the denial of \ncosts is generally punitive. Stanley does require courts in extreme circumstances to reduce costs so as not to render \nan individual civil rights plaintiff indigent. On remand in this case, the District Court should consider the different \nhardships that would be imposed on each particular Plaintiff. \n[28] In the only cited appellate case in which costs were completely denied, Pursche v. Atlas Scraper & Eng'g \nCo., 300 F.2d 467, 489 (9th Cir.1961), we affirmed a finding that neither party would be considered the \"prevailing \nparty\" where one claim of the plaintiff's patent was declared invalid. Id. In the current case, the District Court appears \nto have found that Defendants were the prevailing party. \n[1] I also do not concur in the majority's conclusion that Title VI is inapplicable to the CBest. This court has previously \nheld that Title VI disparate impact analysis closely tracks Title VII disparate impact analysis. Larry P. v. Riles, 793 \nF.2d 969, 982-83 & fns. 9-10 (9th Cir.1986) (as amended) (placing the burden on a Title VI defendant to prove that an \nexam with a disparate impact on African-American children was \"required by educational necessity\"); cf. Smith v. \nBarton, 914 F.2d 1330, 1336 (9th Cir.1990) (stating that courts look to Title VII to determine appropriate rules under \nTitle VI). Thus, because Title VI disparate impact analysis would be the same as that of Title VII, and I conclude that \nTitle VII applies to the CBest as administered by the State and Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC), I do not \nfind it necessary to address the issue whether Title VI is also applicable. \n \n\n \n \n[2] The State is subject to Title VII even though it is a state agency, the CTC, that actually administers the CBest. Title \nVII does not limit its application to direct employers, but includes \"any agent\" of that employer. See 42 U.S.C. § \n2000e-2(a); Morgan v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 884 F.2d 1211, 1214 (9th Cir.1989). \n[3] The majority erroneously relies on Gonzales v. State of California, 29 Cal.App.3d 585, 105 Cal.Rptr. 804 \n(1972), for the proposition that \"California law establishes that [public] teachers are not State employees.\" Majority \nOpinion at 1071-72; see also id. at 1070. Gonzales is inapplicable, however, because it merely holds that the general \ntheory of respondeat superior does not render the State liable for the torts of local school districts or their \nemployees. See id. at 590-92, 105 Cal.Rptr. 804; Butt v. State of California, 4 Cal.4th 668, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 \nP.2d 1240, 1248 (1992) (citing Gonzales). Gonzales thus does not address whether the State may be subject to Title \nVII for its actions in carrying out its broad constitutional duty to educate the state's children. See Butt, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d \n480, 842 P.2d at 1248 (stating that while \"[school] districts are separate political entities for some purposes . . . the \nexistence of th[e] local-district system has not prevented recognition that the State itself has broad responsibility to \nensure basic educational equality under the California Constitution.\"). \n[4] In reaching its holding that the State is not the employer of the public teachers, the majority relies heavily on Fields \nv. Hallsville Indep. Sch. Dist., 906 F.2d 1017, 1020 (5th Cir.1990) (per curiam). In Fields, the Fifth Circuit held that the \nState of Texas was not subject to Title VII for a teacher credentialing exam similar to the CBest because the State \nwas not the employer of the public teachers. Fields is distinguishable in several respects. First, because the issue \nwas not properly raised, the court expressly declined to consider whether Texas's close relationship with the local \nschool districts might change their holding. See id. at 1019 fns. 2 & 3. Second, the analysis in Fields focused on \nwhether Texas exercised any right of control over the teachers. See id. at 1019-20. This analysis may be relevant to \nwhether Texas maintained a direct employment relationship with the public school teachers, but it is inapposite to the \ndetermination whether the State could be an employer under Title VII as a result of its close regulation of public \nschools. \n[5] Numerous courts relying on Sibley have also found public actors to be the relevant employer under Title VII for \ninterfering with the employment opportunities of covered employees.

Comm'n, 463 U.S. 582, 103 S.Ct. 3221, \n77 L.Ed.2d 866 (1983)). \nCourts have generally applied the standards applicable to disparate impact cases under Title VII to \ndisparate impact cases arising under Title VI. Larry P. v. Riles, 793 F.2d 969, 982 & n. 9 (9th Cir.1984); \naccord New York Urban League, Inc. v. New York, 71 F.3d 1031, 1036 (2d Cir.1995); Elston v. Talladega \nCounty Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d 1394, 1407 & n. 14 (11th Cir.1993); Groves v. Alabama State Bd. of Educ., \n776 F.Supp. 1518, 1523 (M.D.Ala.1991). Indeed, the Title VI standard arguably imposes a lower burden \non defendants, who need only show that “a substantial legitimate justification” exists for the challenged \npractice. New York Urban League, 71 F.3d at 1036 (quoting Georgia State Conference of Branches of \nNAACP v. Georgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1417 (11th Cir.1985)); Elston, 997 F.2d at 1407. \nBecause the standards are so similar, the Court will not address the merits of plaintiffs' Title VI claims \nseparately. \n \n4  In July 1983, AMAE filed discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n(“EEOC”) in Los Angeles. Nearly seven years later, in May 1990, the EEOC issued a Letter of Determination. \nThe EEOC notified AMAE in December 1990 that it had referred the case to the Department of Justice. \nIn May 1992, two years after receiving the Letter of Determination, AMAE, through its counsel, requested \na right-to-sue letter from the EEOC. The right-to-sue letter was issued on June 17, 1992. \n \nAMAE then filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC on September 8, 1992. A right-to-sue \nletter on the second charge issued in October 1992. AMAE filed suit in this Court on September 23, 1992. \n \nOn August 3, 1995, defendants sought summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs' action was barred \nby the doctrine of laches. The Court denied the motion in a Memorandum Decision and Order filed August \n25, 1995, holding that genuine issues of material fact remained regarding the reasons for plaintiffs' delay \nin bringing suit, including the extent to which the EEOC's actions were to blame. \nAt trial, defendants did not present any testimony or other evidence on the laches defense. Accordingly, \nthe Court will not consider it. \n \n5  For a more detailed history surrounding the CBEST's implementation, see Association of Mexican–American \nEducators v. California, 836 F.Supp. 1534, 1537–39 (N.D.Cal.1993). \n \n6  There are actually 50 questions in each section, 10 of which are not scored and are used both to field-test \nnew items and to allow the test to be equated with earlier forms of the CBEST. \n \n7  Many teacher preparation programs in California require applicants to pass the CBEST as a prerequisite \nto admission, despite the fact that the State expressly discourages using the examination for admissions \npurposes. See Cal.Educ.Code § 44252(f) (“It is the intent of the Legislature that applicants for admission \nto teacher preparation programs not be denied admission on the basis of state basic skills proficiency test \nresults.”). \n  25 \n\n \nAssociation of Mexican-American Educators v.

There are two half-pints in a pint; two pints in a quart; four quarts in a gallon; \nmultiplied by five gallons. Thus, 2 x 2 x 4 x 5 = 80. \n9  It should be noted that not every person teaching in the public schools in California has passed the CBEST. \nThousands of teachers were “grandfathered” in at the time the CBEST legislation was passed, and others \nhave received waivers from the CTC. \n10  Congress removed the exemptions for state and municipal employers in the 1972 amendments to Title VII. \nSee H.R.Rep. No. 238, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 1, reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2137, 2137, 2152–54. \n \n11  Title VII provides, in pertinent part: \n \nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any \nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of \nsuch individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or \n(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would \ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his \nstatus as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a). \n \n12  Title VII further provides as follows: \n \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for \nan employer ... to give and to act upon the results of any professionally developed ability test provided that \nsuch test, its administration or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to discriminate \nbecause of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(h) (1994). \n \n13  See also Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 446–47, 102 S.Ct. 2525, 2530–31, 73 L.Ed.2d 130 (1982); \nDothard, 433 U.S. at 329, 97 S.Ct. at 2726–27; Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425, 95 S.Ct. \n2362, 2375, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975); Griggs, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849. \n \n14  Courts  have  held  that  burden  of  proof  provisions  in  noncriminal  statutes  are  procedural  and  apply \nretroactively. E.g., Lavespere v. Niagara Mach. & Tool Works, Inc., 920 F.2d 259 (5th Cir.1990), cert. denied, \n510 U.S. 859, 114 S.Ct. 171, 126 L.Ed.2d 131 (1993); Lieberman–Sack v. Harvard Community Health Plan, \n882 F.Supp. 249 (D.R.I.1995). This is consistent with the general practice that a judicial decision altering the \nburden of proof in a civil action applies retroactively to cases pending at the time of the decision. See, e.g., \nMelton v. Moore, 964 F.2d 880 (9th Cir.1992) (discussing James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U.S. \n529, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481 (1991)). \n15  The Court recognizes, of course, that many Latinos are also Caucasian. For simplicity's sake, however, the \nCourt will use the term “whites” to mean non-Latino Caucasians. \n \n16  Plaintiffs have also argued that cumulative pass rates are inappropriate because minority applicants who fail \nthe CBEST are deterred from retaking the test at greater rates than nonminority applicants. See Dothard v. \n  26 \n\n \nAssociation of Mexican-American Educators v. State of Cal., 937 F.Supp. 1397 (1996) \n80 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 476, 113 Ed. Law Rep. 199 \nRawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 330, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 2727, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977). The CTC undertook a study of \nthis issue in 1990. (Ex. 116.) The data showed that Asians and African Americans who failed the CBEST \nrepeated the test in smaller numbers than Latinos and whites. The reasons for this disparity, however, are \nunknown. Plaintiffs produced no evidence of any deterrent effect other than the testimony of Dr. Jew, which \nthe Court finds to be of little weight due to its unscientific, anecdotal nature. \nNotwithstanding this finding, the Court notes that the information provided in the CTC pamphlet distributed \nto those who fail the CBEST is unfortunate. (See Ex. 60.) The pamphlet provides a somewhat misleading \ntable showing the likelihood of passing each section of the CBEST upon retaking it, based on one's current \nscore. As the testimony of defendants' expert, Dr. William Mehrens, illustrated, the table can easily be \nmisinterpreted to reduce the candidate's real likelihood of success by a significant measure. The pamphlet \nalso fails to emphasize that studying for the examination can greatly increase a candidate's ability to pass \nthe CBEST on retaking. \n17  Defendants argued that the CBEST is a licensing test, but it is in fact an employment test. See AMAE, 836 \nF.Supp. at 1550. \n \n18  An employment test is not required to test every skill required to perform the job. Nevertheless, under \nprofessional testing standards, “the investigator should describe the whole job as part of the job analysis, \nindicate what is included in the domain and explain why certain parts were or were not included.” Society \nfor Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Principles for the Validation and Use of Personnel Selection \nProcedures 20 (3d ed. 1987) (“SIOP Principles”). \n19  In addition, both studies are of questionable value because of their serious methodological flaws. The Dick \nstudy involved a very small sample size, thirty-two teachers, and it suffered from an extreme range restriction \nproblem: Only two teachers in the sample had failed the CBEST; the other thirty had passed. The Fresno \nstudy also had an extreme range restriction problem because 98 percent of the teachers in the sample \nreceived the same rating, “satisfactory,” which was the highest available rating on a three-point scale. \n20  The Court finds Dr. Lefkowitz lacking in credibility. Other courts have also made note of his sloppy analysis, \nwhich has included using the incorrect formulae and making basic errors in computation. E.g., Police Officers \nfor Equal Rights v. City of Columbus, 916 F.2d 1092, 1102–03 (6th Cir.1990). \n21  In addition, defendants introduced the Curriculum Matching Project, in which two ETS employees, Ave Maria \nMerritt and Michael Ponisciak, matched CBEST test specifications to material found in textbooks purportedly \nused in the California public schools. Due to the unscientific nature of the study, the Court did not find it \nparticularly helpful; however, the study did support the overall conclusion that the kinds of skills tested on the \nCBEST can be found in elementary and secondary school textbooks. \n22  The term “teacher educator” sounds redundant, but it means a person who teaches would-be teachers. \n \n23  Plaintiffs made much of the fact that the data recording form used in the study instructed the judge as follows: \n“For each item, check the level of relevance for the CBEST program.” (Ex. 120, App. A.) It is true, as plaintiffs \nargue, that the relationship of an item to “the CBEST program” is not the proper inquiry. Even defendants' \nexpert Dr. William Mehrens had to concede as much. The Wheeler and Elias report, however, clearly indicates \nthroughout that the judges were instructed to consider the relevance of items to the job of teaching, not to \n“the CBEST program.” The phrasing on the form was sloppy, but it is a minor mistake and does not negate \nthe study's results. \n  27 \n\n \nAssociation of Mexican-American Educators v. State of Cal., 937 F.Supp. 1397 (1996) \n80 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 476, 113 Ed. Law Rep. 199 \n24  The judges were also asked whether the relative weights assigned to the reading and math skills were right \nand, if not, what weight they should be given. Here, the results were more mixed. More than half of the judges \nconcluded that the weights given the reading skills were about right. Of those who did not, most thought that \nliteral comprehension should be given more weight and logical comprehension, less weight. The percentage \nof judges who thought that the weights assigned to the math skills were about right was much lower; those \nresults were as follows: \n \n \nArithmetic  (40%)  46% \nAlgebra  (40%)  35 \nGeometry  (20%)  59 \n \nGenerally speaking, the judges concluded that more weight should be given to arithmetic and less to \nalgebra, though overall there was significant disagreement on the weighting of skills. \n \nAs Dr. Mehrens explained, however, the relative weight assigned to each of the math subtests is \nunimportant where they are highly correlated, which they are here. (Mehrens Direct Test. at 30–31.) Altering \nthe weights would have “only very minimal effects” on test-takers' CBEST scores. (Id. at 31.) \n25  The time constraints data was considered by Dr. Lundquist to be uninterpretable because of nonsensical \nresults: For instance, high ratings were given to the activity “Establish rapport with all students.” In addition, \nshe received telephone calls from teachers expressing confusion over the category. Thus, no analysis of the \ndata was conducted. (Ex. 1541 at 126, job analysis report.) \n26  No analysis was performed on the “required at entry” data because of concerns about the data. The category \nwas supposed to describe skills that a teacher should know upon entering the job, as opposed to skills that \nwould be learned on the job. Again, nonsensical results suggested that the participants did not understand \nthe scale. For example, the skill “Use the table of contents ... of a book to locate information” was rated \nas required upon entry by less than 80 percent of the survey respondents. In addition, as with the “time \nconstraints” category for activities, Dr. Lundquist received phone calls from confused participants. (Ex. 1541 \nat 130, job analysis results.) \n27  The two dropped reading skills were (1) “Understanding material in another language” and (2) “Recognizing \nthe style or manner of expression used by the author.” (Ex. 1967 at 24.) \n \n28  The two dropped writing skills were (1) “Using informal language when writing” and (2) “Writing at an \nappropriate level for professional publication.” (Ex. 1967 at 25.) \n \n29  The ten retained math skills were: \n \n1. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide with whole numbers. \n \n2. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide with fractions, decimals, and percentages. \n \n3.

To set the record straight, the problem did \nnot involve multiple unknowns; it involved a single unknown. The problem reads as follows: \n \nAccording to her college transcript, Emilia received 6 more A's than B's. If she received a total of 36 A's \nand B's, how many A's did she receive? \n \nA. 12 \n \nB. 21 \n \nC. 24 \n \nD. 27 \n \nE. 30 \n \n(Ex. 642 (problem 70).) \n \nThe most straightforward way to solve the problem is thus: \n36 = x + (x + 6) \n36 = 2x + 6 \n \n30 = 2x \n  31 \n\n \nAssociation of Mexican-American Educators v. State of Cal., 937 F.Supp. 1397 (1996) \n80 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 476, 113 Ed. Law Rep. 199 \n15 = x \n \n“X” represents the number of B's and “x = 6” represents the number of A's. Therefore, Emilia received 21 \nA's and the correct answer is B. There is but one unknown: x. \n \nMoreover, as Dr. Lundquist testified, this is not the only way to solve the problem. One could also eyeball \nit—that is, divide 36 by two to get 18, then count up by three to get 21. Or, one could use trial and error by \nsimply subtracting six from each answer choice until one figured out which answer plus the answer minus \nsix equals 36. None of these methods involves using more than one unknown. \nAccording to defendants, those unretained math skill items that remain on the revised CBEST are used \nonly for equating purposes; they are not scored. \n34  The CBEST passing scores remained unchanged. \n \n35  Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Lundquist's criteria for retention of skills in the job analysis were too lenient because \n(1) she did not make use of the “required at entry” data and (2) she used a 1.5 mean rather than a 2.0 mean \nfor the importance scale, which plaintiffs consider too low. \n \nA 1.5, which is the midpoint of Dr. Lundquist's three-point scale, falls between “minor” and “important.” \nPlaintiffs argue that this was insufficient to guarantee that the skill so adjudged was important, which is \nrequired by the Uniform Guidelines and prevailing professional standards. The Uniform Guidelines state: \nThere should be a job analysis which includes an analysis of the important work behavior(s) required for \nsuccessful performance and their relative importance.   The work behavior(s) selected for measurement \nshould be critical work behavior(s) and/or important work behavior(s) constituting most of the job. \nUniform Guidelines, 29 C.F.R. § 1607.14(C)(2). \nThe Court finds that both of Dr. Lundquist's decisions reflect manifestly reasonable professional judgments. \nAs discussed supra, Dr. Lundquist explained that she did not analyze the “required at entry” data because \nof concerns that the respondents had not understood what they were being asked. With respect to the 1.5 \nmean, as Dr. Lundquist testified at trial, a 1.5 rounds up to 2.0. It must be remembered that the mean rating \nof 1.5 was coupled with an 80 percent endorsement criterion, which is quite stringent. \n36  Seventeen percent of the 234 panelists in Dr. Watkins' Practitioners' Review in 1985 were nonteachers. (Ex. \n118 at 4, Practitioners' Review.) By examining the data from that study, it is possible to determine whether the \nresponses of nonteachers differed from the responses of teachers. They did not. Approximately 89 percent \nof nonteachers judged the reading questions to be either moderately or very relevant, compared with 90 \npercent overall. On the math test, 91 percent of nonteachers compared with 87 percent overall rated the \nitems to be moderately or very relevant. \n37  During the first administration of the CBEST, examinees had 60 minutes for each of the three sections. \nFrom 1982 to 1984, the time limit for the mathematics section was 65 minutes. In 1984, the time limits were \nincreased to 65 minutes on reading, 70 minutes on mathematics; writing remained at 60 minutes. \nIn June 1995, the time limit was changed to four hours to complete either the entire test or any portion(s) \nof the test that the examinee has previously failed; thus, the examinee has four hours in which to complete \none, two, or all three sections of the CBEST. \n  32 \n\n \nAssociation of Mexican-American Educators v.

Furthermore, in grading students [sic] essays, Dale fails to detect grammatical \nerrors in student's [sic] papers. \n—Notes home to parents ocassionally [sic] have spelling mistakes and exhibit a rather haphazard \norganization of the information. \n \n—The principal finds that Dale has difficulty keeping track of lunch money, field trip expenses and \nattendance records. \n—The principal doesn't know whether Dale lacks attention to detail [sic] or is simply deficient in some \nreading and math skills. \n(Ex. 120, App. E.) \n \n44  The independent judges' figure was 19.5 and the discussion group's, 17.8. \n \n45  The writing score was set where recommended, at a raw score of 12. \n \n46  In addition, the 1985 Watkins study included a passing score study. The Court finds this study less helpful \nthan Dr. Lundquist's studies because of the way in which the participants were instructed. The judges were \nasked to estimate the percentage of “entry-level credential applicants” who should be expected to answer \neach test item. This task is quite different from the Wheeler and Elias approach, in which the judges were \nasked to make judgments regarding borderline, rather than all entry-level, candidates. Also, the Ebel method \nwas employed, which, though similar to the Angoff method, tends to result in higher passing standards. \nThus, as one would expect, the recommended passing scores in the Watkins study were higher than those \nobtained in the 1982 study. Taking the mean of the recommended passing scores, the passing score for \nthe reading test was 29, the same as the actual passing score set by Honig, and the passing score for the \nmathematics test was also 29, two points higher than the actual passing score. \n47  It is worth noting that a passing score of 81 percent correct on the PPST would result in only a one-third \npassing rate on the examination, whereas a comparable passing score on the CBEST would result in a \nsubstantially higher pass rate, 65 percent. \n48  With such a passing score, only 40 percent of PPST examinees would pass the reading test, whereas 62 \npercent of CBEST examinees would pass. \n49  As noted above, many of the math items were not retained under the new CBEST specifications. Thus, for \nher analysis, a total of only 33 items from both forms of the math test were retained, which she combined \nas though they were one form of the test. \n50  The meetings were held in Fresno (18 participants), Los Angeles (54 participants), Sacramento (33 \nparticipants), San Diego (22 participants), and San Jose (37 participants). \n \n51  Again, this includes the 40 scored items and the 10 nonscored items on each subtest. \n \n52  Although Dr. Lundquist found that African–Americans established lower passing standards than other ethnic \ngroups, she determined that the cause of this was a single participant whose ratings were extremely low— \n  34 \n\n \nAssociation of Mexican-American Educators v. State of Cal., 937 F.Supp. 1397 (1996) \n80 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 476, 113 Ed. Law Rep. 199 \nmore than three standard deviations below the group mean. Though she chose not to do so, Dr. Lundquist \nclearly would have been justified in discarding these outlier ratings. \n53  Dr. Poggio attempted to challenge the results of the supplemental passing score study by conducting a \ntelephone survey of study participants. The results of that survey purported to show that the participants in Dr. \nLundquist's passing score study did not have a clear understanding of the task they were asked to complete, \nthereby raising concerns about the study's conclusions. \nThe Court, however, finds that the telephone survey is fatally flawed methodologically and wholly unreliable. \nIt was neither blind nor double-blind; there is no assurance that the interviews were conducted in any \nkind of consistent or standardized manner; the script (such as it was) contained biasing language; the \ninterviews were conducted as much as three months after the interviewee had participated in the passing \nscore study; and, perhaps most important, the participants' responses to questions about how they had \nbeen instructed at the passing score study were not even recorded, despite the fact that the telephone \nsurvey is supposed to support Dr. Poggio's main assertion that Dr. Lundquist's instructions to the Angoff \npanels had been inadequate. \n54  Table 3 in Dr. Haworth's report shows that over half of those who take the CBEST are either “seeking \ncredentials” (48 percent) or fulfilling a “requirement for employment” (6 percent), and Tables 13A and 13B \nshow that only 83 percent of these applicants eventually pass. Thus, as Dr. Mehrens pointed out, some or \nall of the 17 percent who failed probably would have been credentialed were it not for the CBEST, i.e., they \nprobably satisfied Dr. Haertel's requirements even though they lack the basic skills that are needed to pass \nthe CBEST. No one rebutted Mehrens' testimony on this point. \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n  35 ",

They appeal from an adverse judgment in their action against the State of California and\nits agency, challenging (1) the district court's holding that the California Basic Education Skills Test (\"CBEST\"),\nwhich is a prerequisite to employment in a variety of positions in the California public schools, violates neither\nTitle VI nor Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and (2) the district court's use of a technical advisor at trial.\nDefendants cross-appeal from the district court's rulings, on summary judgment, that Title VI and Title VII apply in\nthis case. Defendants also appeal from the district court's order denying their request for costs. For the reasons\nthat follow, we hold that Title VII applies to the CBEST; that the CBEST was validated properly; that the district\ncourt permissibly used a technical advisor; and that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to\n\naward costs to Defendants. Accordingly, we affirm both the judgment in Defendants' favor and the order denying\nthem costs.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nEffective February 1, 1983, the California legislature amended the California Education Code to prohibit the\nCalifornia Commission on Teacher Credentialing (\"CCTC\") from issuing \"any credential, permit, certificate, or\nrenewal of an emergency credential to any person to serve in the public schools unless the person has\ndemonstrated proficiency in basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills.\" Cal. Educ.Code § 44252(b). At the\nsame time, the legislature authorized the state's Superintendent of Public Instruction to \"adopt an appropriate\n578 state test to measure *578 proficiency in these basic skills.\" Cal. Educ.Code § 44252(c). The Superintendent\nadopted the CBEST and, in May 1983, CCTC assumed responsibility for administering and revising the test.\n[1]\nThe CBEST is a pass-fail examination consisting of three sections: reading, writing, and mathematics.  The\nreading and mathematics sections each contain 50 multiple-choice questions, 40 of which are scored. The writing\nsection consists of two essays. The CBEST was revised in 1995. At that time, questions that tested \"higher order\"\nmathematical skills, such as geometry, were eliminated from the mathematics section of the test.\nTo pass the CBEST, a candidate must receive a \"scaled\" score of 123. Accordingly, a candidate passes by\naveraging 41 points on each of the three sections (out of a score range of 20 to 80). A scaled score of 41 on the\nreading section translates into a raw score of 28 out of 40 questions correct; on the mathematics section, a\nscaled score of 41 equates to a raw score of 26 out of 40 correct. Each of the two essays is graded by two\nreaders, who give raw scores of between one and four points per essay. Thus, the range of possible scores for\nthe writing section is between four and 16 points. A raw score of 12 points translates into a scaled score of 41\npoints. The CBEST employs a \"compensatory scoring\" model, under which a candidate passes the test with a\nscaled score lower than 41 on a particular section, so long as his or her total scaled score is at least 123.\nA passing score on the CBEST is required for all public elementary and secondary school teachers in California. \nSee Cal. Educ.Code §§ 44256, 44257, 44259. A passing score also is required for many nonteaching employees\nof the California public schools, including administrators, see id. § 44270, school counselors, see id. § 44266,\nand school librarians, see id. § 44269.\nSince the CBEST's inception, minority candidates have disproportionately received failing scores. The named\nPlaintiffs are three nonprofit organizations that represent the interests of minority educators, and eight individual\nminority candidates. They brought this action against the State of California and the CCTC to challenge the\nvalidity of the test under Title VI and Title VII, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. The district\ncourt certified the following class:\nAll Latinos, African-Americans and Asians who have sought or are seeking California public school\ncredentials and certificated positions who have been, are being, or will be adversely affected in\ntheir ability to obtain credentials and certificated positions by [CBEST] results.\nIn their complaint, Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the use of the CBEST, alleging that the test has a disproportionate,\nadverse impact on minority candidates and that Defendants have failed to adopt screening procedures with a\nless adverse impact.\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, addressing the applicability of Titles VI and VII. In August\n1993, the district court granted partial summary judgment to Plaintiffs, concluding that both Titles VI and VII apply\nto the CBEST. See Association of Mexican-American Educators v. California, 836 F.Supp. 1534 (N.D.Cal.1993) (\"\nAMAE I\"). Following a bench trial, the district court held that: (1) Plaintiffs had demonstrated that the CBEST has\na disparate impact on minorities; (2) the studies that were submitted at trial demonstrated that the test was a valid\nmeasure of job-related skills; (3) the level at which the passing scores were set reflected reasonable professional\njudgments about minimum levels of basic knowledge; and (4) Plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that other,\n579 equally effective *579 screening devices existed. The court entered a judgment in Defendants' favor. See \nAssociation of Mexican-American Educators v. California, 937 F.Supp. 1397 (N.D.Cal.1996) (\"AMAE II\").\n\nDefendants then presented the district court with a bill for taxable costs pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 54(d)(1). That cost bill totaled $216,443.67. In an order dated February 12, 1997, the district court\ndenied the cost bill in its entirety.\nOn appeal, Plaintiffs argue (1) that the district court erred in concluding, after trial, that the CBEST was validated\nproperly and (2) that the court violated Federal Rule of Evidence 706 by relying on the advice of an expert who\nwas not subject to cross-examination and did not prepare a report. Defendants cross-appeal with respect to the\ndistrict court's conclusions, on summary judgment, that Titles VI and VII apply. Defendants also appeal from the\n[2]\ndistrict court's order denying costs.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Title VII\n[3]\nA. Title VII Applies to the CBEST.\nDefendants appeal from the district court's summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on the issue of the applicability\nof Titles VI and VII. We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment. See Robi v. Reed, 173\nF.3d 736, 739 (9th Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 120 S.Ct. 375, 145 L.Ed.2d 293 (1999).\nAs a threshold matter, we note that, because we ultimately hold that the CBEST was validated properly (see Part\nI.B., below), we could decline to decide whether Titles VI and VII apply. Were we to do so, we simply would\nassume for the sake of argument that the statutes apply and move immediately to the question of validation.\nAlthough that might appear to be an expedient approach, we decline to follow it for three reasons. First, as a\nmatter of logic, the applicability of Title VI or Title VII is a predicate to any discussion of validation. Validation\nwould not be required, and indeed would not even be relevant, if neither Title VI nor Title VII applies. Second, as\na matter of fairness, these parties deserve an answer not only to the bare question of who wins this case, but\nalso to the underlying question of the applicability of federal civil rights law to the CBEST. The state, in particular,\nhas proceeded for years on the assumption that those laws apply to its administration of the CBEST and has\nexpended considerable effort and expense in attempting to comply with federal law in this area. If that effort was\nunnecessary, the state deserves to know, so that it may act accordingly in the future. Third, as a matter of judicial\neconomy, our answer to the statutory question can avoid future litigation by other parties. We turn, then, to a\ndiscussion of Title VII's application.\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides:\nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer 00\n97\n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\nbecause of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin[.]\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Title VII applies \"to governmental and private employers alike.\" Dothard v. Rawlinson,\n580 433 *580 U.S. 321, 332 n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977).\nPlaintiffs and Defendants do not have a direct employment relationship. Rather, Plaintiffs are employees and\npotential employees of individual school districts in California. That fact does not end our inquiry, however. A\ndirect employment relationship is not a prerequisite to Title VII liability. Although \"there must be some connection\nwith an employment relationship for Title VII protections to apply,\" that \"connection with employment need not\nnecessarily be direct.\" Lutcher v. Musicians Union Local 47, 633 F.2d 880, 883 (9th Cir.1980).\nAmong other things, we have held that an entity that is not the direct employer of a Title VII plaintiff nevertheless\nmay be liable if it \"`interferes with an individual's employment opportunities with another employer.'\" Gomez v.\nAlexian Bros. Hosp., 698 F.2d 1019, 1021 (9th Cir. 1983) (quoting Lutcher, 633 F.2d at 883 n. 3). In Gomez, we\n\nheld that the defendant hospital could be held liable under Title VII for its discriminatory treatment of the plaintiff,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff was employed by a third party, if the defendant had interfered with the\nplaintiff's employment by that third party. See id. at 1021.\nIn so holding, we followed the opinion of the District of Columbia Circuit in Sibley Memorial Hospital v. Wilson,\n[4]\n488 F.2d 1338, 1340-41 (D.C.Cir.1973).  In Sibley, the plaintiff was a male private-duty nurse. When a patient in\nthe defendant hospital requested a private nurse, the hospital arranged through a registry service to have a\nprivate nurse provided. That nurse attended the patient at the hospital, but was paid directly by the patient. The\nplaintiff alleged that the defendant allowed male nurses like him to attend male patients only, but allowed female\nnurses to attend both male and female patients. See id. at 1339-40.\nThe D.C. Circuit concluded that the defendant could be held liable under Title VII even though it was not the\nplaintiff's direct employer. The court reasoned that, although the defendant did not employ the plaintiff, it\nexercised considerable power over his ability to form employment relationships with third parties. The court noted\nthat Congress intended, through Title VII, to prohibit entities that possessed such power from \"foreclos[ing], on\ninvidious grounds, access by any individual to employment opportunities otherwise available to him.\" Id. at 1341.\nThe court further stated:\nTo permit a covered employer to exploit circumstances particularly affording it the capability of\ndiscriminatorily interfering with an individual's employment opportunities with another employer,\nwhile it could not do so with respect to employment in its own service, would be to condone\ncontinued use of the very criteria for employment that Congress has prohibited.\nId. Finally, the court held that the defendant's control over the premises on which the plaintiff provided his\nservices, as well as its control over the plaintiff's access to patients, created a \"highly visible nexus with the\ncreation and continuance of direct employment relationships between third parties\" that brought the defendant's\nactions within the scope of Title VII. Id. at 1342.\nThe D.C. Circuit's holding in Sibley was rooted in the text of Title VII. The Court reasoned that, although Title VII\napplies to \"employees,\" Congress extended the protections of the statute to \"any individual\" who suffers\n581 discrimination: \"nowhere are there words of limitation that restrict *581 references in the Act to `any individual' as\ncomprehending only an employee of an employer.\" Id. at 1341. As we did in Gomez, we agree that the D.C.\nCircuit's interpretation of the statutory text is the proper one in view of \"Congress' directive to read Title VII\nbroadly so as to best effectuate its remedial purposes.\" Duffield v. Robertson Stephens & Co., 144 F.3d 1182,\n1192 (9th Cir.),cert. denied,525 U.S. 982, 119 S.Ct. 445, 142 L.Ed.2d 399 (1998).\nWe also note, as did the Sibley court, see488 F.2d at 1342, that Congress explicitly made Title VII applicable\noutside the \"direct employment\" context by including employment agencies and labor organizations in the\nstatute's coverage. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(b), (c). In particular, employment agencies 00 defined as parties\n97\n\"regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure employees for an employer or to procure for\nemployees opportunities to work for an employer,\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(c) 00 may not \"refuse to refer ... or\n97\notherwise discriminate against\" any individual under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(b). This provision of Title VII,\nlike the others, applies to states. See Dothard, 433 U.S. at 332 n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2720; Dumas v. Town of Mt.\nVernon, 612 F.2d 974, 980 (5th Cir.1980),overruled on other grounds by Larkin v. Pullman-Standard Div.,\nPullman Inc., 854 F.2d 1549 (11th Cir.1988),rev'd sub nom. Pullman-Standard, Inc. v. Swint, 493 U.S. 929, 110\nS.Ct. 316, 107 L.Ed.2d 307 (1989). We do not suggest that Defendants are, strictly speaking, an \"employment\nagency\" under Title VII, although they perform an analogous function. Rather, we mention this statutory provision\nas evidence that Congress intended to close any loopholes in Title VII's coverage and to extend the statute's\ncoverage to entities with actual \"[c]ontrol over access to the job market,\" Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1341, whether or not\nthey are direct employers.\nIn concluding that Title VII applies in this case, the district court held that Defendants \"interfere[d]\" with Plaintiffs'\nemployment opportunities with local school districts in California by requiring, implementing, and administering\nthe CBEST. See AMAE I,836 F.Supp. at 1551. We agree.\n\nOur conclusion is dictated by the peculiar degree of control that the State of California exercises over local school\ndistricts. In California, public schools are \"a matter of statewide rather than local or municipal concern; their\nestablishment, regulation and operation are covered by the [state] constitution and the state Legislature is given\ncomprehensive powers in relation thereto.\" Hall v. City of Taft, 47 Cal.2d 177, 179, 302 P.2d 574, 576 (1956). The\nCalifornia legislature \"has plenary authority over the education of California's youth.\" San Francisco NAACP v.\nSan Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., 484 F.Supp. 657, 662 (N.D.Cal.1979). It is \"well settled that the California\nConstitution makes public education uniquely a fundamental concern of the state\" and that \"the degree of\nsupervision ... retained by the State over the common school system is high indeed.\" Butt v. California, 4 Cal.4th\n668, 685, 689, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d 1240, 1251, 1254 (1992).\nThe state's involvement is not limited to general legislative oversight but, rather, affects the day-to-day operations\nof local public schools. \"Unlike most states, California school districts have budgets that are controlled and\nfunded by the state government rather than the local districts.\" Belanger v. Madera Unified Sch. Dist., 963 F.2d\n248, 251 (9th Cir.1992). As the California Supreme Court noted in Butt, California statutes regulate \"district\norganization, elections, and governance; educational programs, instructional materials, and proficiency testing;\nsex discrimination and affirmative action; admission standards; compulsory attendance; school facilities; rights\nand responsibilities of students and parents; holidays; school health, safety, and nutrition; teacher credentialing\n582 and certification; rights and *582 duties of public school employees; and the pension system for public school\nteachers.\" Butt, 4 Cal.4th at 689, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d at 1254 (citations omitted). The state also\n\"dictates when students may be expelled or suspended, and ... exerts control over the textbooks that are used in\npublic schools.\" Belanger, 963 F.2d at 253 (citations omitted).\nIndeed, the state is so entangled with the operation of California's local school districts that individual districts are\ntreated as \"state agencies\" for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. See Freeman v. Oakland Unified Sch. Dist.,\n179 F.3d 846, 846 (9th Cir.1999). The fact that the districts are entitled to assert Eleventh Amendment immunity\nunderscores the state's unusually high degree of involvement in the operation of local schools.\nAgainst that background of \"plenary\" state control, we have no difficulty concluding that the State of California is\nin a theoretical and practical position to \"interfere\" with the employment decisions of local school districts. And by\nrequiring, formulating, and administering the CBEST, the state has \"interfered\" to a degree sufficient to bring it\nwithin the reach of Title VII. Through the CBEST, the state has created a limited list of candidates from which\nlocal public school districts may hire. Private schools may hire candidates who have not passed the CBEST; but\nCalifornia's public schools, which are under the state's control in almost every aspect of their operations, may not.\nThus, in addition to controlling local districts' budgets and textbooks and regulating the duties of public school\nemployees, the state dictates whom the districts may and may not hire. That degree of control over districts'\nhiring decisions subjects Defendants to the coverage of Title VII in this case.\nThe relationship between the State of California and California's local school districts is analogous to the\nrelationship between a corporate parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries. \"In the absence of special\ncircumstances, a parent corporation is not liable for the Title VII violations of its wholly owned subsidiary.\" Watson\nv. Gulf & W. Indus., 650 F.2d 990, 993 (9th Cir.1981). In Watson, this court held that the parent corporation was\nnot subject to Title VII because the case presented no \"special circumstances.\" Id. But the court went on to\nexplain that, \"[i]f there was any evidence that [the parent] participated in or influenced the employment policies of\n[the subsidiary], ... then we would be presented with a very different case.\" Id. Ours is that \"very different case.\"\nThe \"parent\" state has participated extensively in, and influenced, the employment policies and practices of the\n\"subsidiary\" local school districts; therefore, the state is covered by Title VII.\nDefendants contend, however, that they are not subject to Title VII because the CBEST is merely a licensing\nexamination. The administration of such examinations, they argue, is not covered by Title VII. As support for that\nargument, they cite several cases that have held that governmental agencies are not subject to Title VII with\nregard to their licensing activities. See Haddock v. Board of Dental Exam'rs, 777 F.2d 462 (9th Cir.1985); Fields v.\nHallsville Indep. Sch. Dist., 906 F.2d 1017 (5th Cir.1990); George v. New Jersey Bd. of Veterinary Med. Exam'rs,\n[5]\n794 F.2d 113 (3d Cir.1986).\n\nThe cases on which Defendants rely are not controlling for two reasons. First, the state's high level of\ninvolvement in the operation of local public schools distinguishes this case from those that Defendants cite. In\nthose cases, licensing was the entire connection between the plaintiffs and the defendants; here, the CBEST is\n583 but one aspect of pervasive state control. *583Second, the CBEST is not merely an ordinary licensing\nexamination; it applies only to public school employees. In other words, the State of California is acting pursuant\nto its proprietary, as well as its police, power.\nThere is no overarching \"licensing\" exception to Title VII. The cases that Defendants cite stand for a related but\nnarrower proposition 00 that Title VII does not apply when the only connection among the licensing agency, the\n97\nplaintiff, and the universe of prospective employers is the agency's implementation of a general licensing\nexamination. In such cases, to borrow the words of the Sibley court, the agency does not have a \"highly visible\nnexus with the creation and continuance of direct employment relationships between third parties,\" such as would\nsubject it to Title VII under an \"interference\" theory. Sibley, 488 F.2d at 1342.\nIn Haddock, the plaintiff conceded that his only connection to the defendant Board of Dental Examiners was that\nthe Board had given him an examination that he failed. This court concluded that such a connection, by itself,\nwas insufficient to subject the Board to Title VII liability. See777 F.2d at 464. The plaintiff apparently did not argue\nthat the Board had \"interfered\" with his employment under the principle adopted in Gomez and Sibley; if he did,\nthe opinion does not mention it.\nIn Fields, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants had violated Title VII through their administration of the Texas\nExamination for Current Administrators and Teachers (TECAT), a compulsory certification examination. See906\nF.2d at 1019. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state defendants, concluding that they\ndid not have an employment relationship with the plaintiffs. On appeal, the plaintiffs challenged that conclusion,\narguing that the state defendants actually controlled their employment even though the plaintiffs nominally were\nemployed by local districts. In rejecting that argument, the Fifth Circuit noted that \"[t]he only evidence presented\nby [the plaintiffs] suggesting control is the Texas State Board of Education's administration of the TECAT exam\nand its ability to decertify teachers who fail the exam.\" Id. (emphasis in original). Of particular relevance to this\ncase is footnote three of the opinion, which reads:\nIn a footnote in [the plaintiffs'] brief on appeal, they present evidence regarding state funding of\nfacilities, payment of salaries and selection of textbooks. As this evidence was not before the\ndistrict court, it is not part of the summary judgment record on appeal.\nId. at 1019 n. 3. The court suggested that the outcome might be different if there were such evidence of the\nstate's right to control the work of the teachers. See id. at 1019-20.\nFinally, in George, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners had violated\nTitle VII by administering a licensing examination that discriminated against him on the basis of national origin. \nSee794 F.2d at 114. The Third Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's action. The court\ndistinguished Sibley, on which the plaintiff had relied, stating:\nIn the Sibley Memorial Hospital case the relationship of the hospital to the employment by its\npatients of private duty nurses secured for them by the hospital was very close, whereas in the\npresent case there was nothing even remotely resembling an employer-employee relationship\nbetween the Board and the plaintiff.\nId.\nTo summarize, the circumstances here demonstrate a level of control and interference far greater than that in the\n\"mere licensing\" cases on which Defendants rely. The State of California exerts a high degree of control over the\noperation of local public school districts. That control is evidenced both by the record and by California law.\n584 *584 Defendants cite George for the further proposition that state licensing examinations are acts of state police\npower, to which Title VII does not apply. But in George, the Board was acting only pursuant to the state's police\npower to protect the public from incompetent veterinarians and was not attempting to control the hiring practices\n\nof, or the performance of work for, any specific employer. By contrast, the CBEST does not apply across-the-\nboard to all who wish to teach in California, as (for example) a veterinary licensing examination applies to all who\nwish to practice the profession of veterinary medicine within the state's borders. Rather, the CBEST applies only\nto those who wish to teach for the public school system 00 a system over which the State of California exerts\n97\nplenary control, including regulation of employees' duties.\nWe conclude, therefore, that administration of the CBEST is not solely an exercise of the state's police power.\nRather, it is an exercise of both the state's police power and its proprietary power; and it is the exercise of\nproprietary power that subjects the state to the coverage of Title VII in this case.\nWe hold that the CBEST examination is subject to the provisions of Title VII. We turn next to the question whether\nthe CBEST violates the provisions of that Act.\nB. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err in Concluding that the CBEST\n[6]\nWas Properly Validated.\n\"[D]iscriminatory tests are impermissible unless shown, by professionally acceptable methods, to be predictive of\nor significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or\njobs for which candidates are being evaluated.\" Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 431, 95 S.Ct.\n2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). In evaluating employment tests that are alleged to have a racially disparate impact,\nwe first consider whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case by demonstrating that the test causes a\ndisparate impact on the basis of race. Here, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs had established a prima\nfacie case. See AMAE II,937 F.Supp. at 1403. Defendants do not challenge that conclusion on appeal.\nBecause Plaintiffs have established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to Defendants to demonstrate that the\n[7]\nCBEST was validated properly. See Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 425, 95 S.Ct. 2362. In its detailed and\ncareful opinion, the district court concluded that Defendants had met their burden and that the test had been\nvalidated properly based on three studies: (1) the 1982 Wheeler and Elias study; (2) the 1985 Practitioners'\nReview; and (3) the 1995 Lundquist study. See AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1411. Plaintiffs challenge that\nconclusion.\nAlthough this court has not discussed in detail the appropriate standard of review for a district court's ruling on\ntest validation, we have applied the \"clearly erroneous\" standard. Clady v. County of Los Angeles, 770 F.2d 1421,\n1434 (9th Cir.1985). The other circuits that have addressed this issue likewise have applied the \"clearly\nerroneous\" standard. See, e.g., Melendez v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 79 F.3d 661, 669 (7th Cir.1996); Bernard v. Gulf\n585 Oil Corp., 890 F.2d 735, 743 (5th *585 Cir.1989); Hamer v. City of Atlanta, 872 F.2d 1521, 1526 (11th Cir.1989).\nThe question whether a test has been validated properly is primarily a factual question, which depends on\nunderlying factual determinations regarding the content and reliability of the validation studies that a defendant\nutilized. Consistent with Clady, we review for clear error the district court's determination in this case that the\nCBEST was validated properly.\nTo demonstrate that the CBEST was validated properly, Defendants are required to \"show that it has `a manifest\nrelationship to the employment in question.'\" Clady, 770 F.2d at 1427 (quoting Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401\nU.S. 424, 432, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971)). In cases in which a scored test, like this one, is challenged,\nwe require that the test be \"job related\" 00 that is, \"that it actually measures skills, knowledge, or ability required\n97\nfor successful performance of the job.\" Contreras v. City of Los Angeles, 656 F.2d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir. 1981). In\nmaking a determination about job-relatedness, we follow a three-step approach:\nThe employer must first specify the particular trait or characteristic which the selection device is\nbeing used to identify or measure. The employer must then determine that the particular trait or\ncharacteristic is an important element of work behavior. Finally, the employer must demonstrate by\n\"professionally acceptable methods\" that the selection device is \"predictive of or significantly\ncorrelated\" with the element of work behavior identified in the second step.\n\nCraig v. County of Los Angeles, 626 F.2d 659, 662 (9th Cir.1980) (quoting Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 431, 95\n[8]\nS.Ct. 2362).\nWe will analyze each of those three steps in turn. In addition, we will consider Plaintiffs' argument that the\n[9]\npassing score on the writing component of the CBEST is set too high.\n1. Specific Traits or Characteristics\nThe first step of our inquiry is to identify the trait or characteristic that the test is designed to measure. See Craig,\n626 F.2d at 662. Here, the district court found that the test was being used to measure \"basic skills in reading,\nwriting, and mathematics,\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1411, and Plaintiffs do not dispute that finding.\n2. Important Elements of Work Behavior\nNext, we consider whether basic skills in reading, writing, and mathematics are \"important element[s] of work\nbehavior,\" Craig, 626 F.2d at 662, for the public school jobs for which the test is required. The district court found\nthat the tested skills were important to the jobs at issue. See AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1419. Plaintiffs challenge\n586 that finding on three grounds. First, they argue that the 1985 Practitioners' Review failed to identify any*586\nparticular work behaviors or job duties and thus could not be used to assess whether the CBEST measured\nimportant elements of work behavior. Second, they argue that Lundquist's 1995 study failed to distinguish\n\"important\" skills from skills that are less important. Third, they argue that Defendants failed to demonstrate that\nthe CBEST is job-related for the particular positions for which it is required. We address each of those arguments\nin turn.\nPlaintiffs first argue that the 1985 Practitioners' Review, conducted by Dr. Richard Watkins, was inadequate\nbecause it failed to identify specific job duties to which the CBEST skills could be correlated. We conclude that\nthe district court did not clearly err in finding that the 1985 study adequately identified the \"element[s] of work\nbehavior,\" Craig, 626 F.2d at 662, that the CBEST is designed to measure.\nThe district court found that the Review comprised the \"pooled judgments\" of knowledgeable persons, such as\nincumbents in the jobs, \"about the relevance of the skills tested on the CBEST to the jobs for which it is required,\nan appropriate form of a job analysis under the professional standards of the time.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1419\n. Specifically, the Practitioners' Review consulted 234 teachers, administrators, and other public school\nemployees, 36 percent of whom were members of minority groups. See id. at 1413. \"The participants took part in\nnine review panels, in which they judged the relevance of both the skills assessed by the CBEST and the test\nitems themselves.\" Id. They were asked to rate how relevant each of the CBEST skills would be to the work of\nfour groups: (1) elementary school teachers; (2) secondary school teachers; (3) librarians, counselors, and\nattendance officers; and (4) school administrators. See id. The possible ratings ranged from \"not relevant\" to\n\"very relevant.\" Id.\nThus, the Practitioners' Review was designed to learn from teachers, administrators, and other school employees\nthe categories of skills that they considered relevant to their own jobs. The skills measured by the study tracked\nthe categories of skills measured by the CBEST, and the skills were described in some detail on the rating forms\nused by the panel members. For example, the broad skill category \"Mathematical concepts and relationships\"\nwas further described as follows:\nQuestions in this category test the understanding of basic concepts, such as the meaning of\ncertain terms (area, for example), order among numbers, relationships shown by graphs,\nelementary probability, and the like. Questions in this category may be from arithmetic, algebra, or\nelementary geometry.\nThe study's participants were guided by detailed instructions relating to each skill category and were told to rank\nthe importance of each skill for both teaching and nonteaching jobs. The study therefore satisfies the requirement\n\nfrom Craig that the employer determine whether a \"specific trait or characteristic is an important element of work\nbehavior.\" Craig, 626 F.2d at 662. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that the 1985 Practitioners'\nReview was \"an appropriate form of a job analysis under the professional standards of the time.\" AMAE II, 937\nF.Supp. at 1419.\nWe next consider Plaintiff's second challenge under the \"important elements\" prong of Craig. Plaintiffs do not\nchallenge the 1995 Lundquist study's methodology for identifying job-related skills. They do, however, challenge\nthat study's method for determining which skills are \"important\" to particular jobs.\nDr. Lundquist polled experts and interviewed and observed educators in order to develop a list of activities and\nskills used by educators. See AMAE II,937 F.Supp. at 1414. She then polled 1,330 teachers and administrators,\n587 asking them to rate the importance of those activities and skills on a four-point scale from 0 *587 (\"not\napplicable\") to 3 (\"critical\"). Activities and skills were retained only if \"at least 80 percent of the survey\nrespondents rated the activity or skill as applicable to the job and the mean importance rating was 1.5 or higher.\" \nId. at 1414 (emphasis in original). Applying those standards led to elimination of a number of the activities and\nskills from Dr. Lundquist's list. After conducting additional studies, which are described in detail in the district\ncourt's opinion, see id. at 1415-17, Dr. Lundquist then formulated new specifications for all three sections of the\ntest. In response to those specifications, Defendants revised the CBEST before they administered the August\n1995 test.\nPlaintiffs focus on the fact that Dr. Lundquist retained activities and skills on her list if they received a \"mean\nimportance rating\" of 1.5 on a scale that designated 2 as \"important\" and 1 as \"minor.\" By using a mean rating of\n1.5, Plaintiffs argue, Dr. Lundquist retained skills and activities that were rated as \"less than important\" by the\nstudy's participants. Therefore, their argument proceeds, the study violated the requirement from Craig that only\n\"important\" work skills be measured.\nThe district court rejected Plaintiffs' argument, finding that \"Dr. Lundquist's decisions reflect manifestly reasonable\nprofessional judgments.... With respect to the 1.5 mean, as Dr. Lundquist testified at trial, a 1.5 rounds up to 2.0.\nIt must be remembered that the mean rating of 1.5 was coupled with an 80 percent endorsement criterion, which\nis quite stringent.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1418 n. 35.\nWe agree that it is theoretically possible to imagine a circumstance that illustrates Plaintiffs' concerns on this\npoint. For example, suppose that 80 percent of the study's participants agreed that a particular skill was relevant,\nbut 75 percent of them rated that skill's importance as \"minor.\" If the remaining 25 percent rated the skill as\n\"critical,\" then the skill would be retained despite the fact that a majority of the study's participants rated its\nimportance as \"minor.\" Although that scenario is possible, such a skewed distribution of responses is unlikely.\nPlaintiffs present only a theoretical possibility that such \"highly relevant but unimportant\" skills remained on Dr.\nLundquist's list. Further, as the district court noted, Dr. Lundquist conducted additional \"importance\" reviews of\nthe mathematics section of the test.\nValidation studies \"are by their nature difficult, expensive, time consuming and rarely, if ever, free of error.\" \nCleghorn v. Herrington, 813 F.2d 992, 996 (9th Cir. 1987). Plaintiffs' argument demonstrates, at most, that Dr.\nLundquist's study may not be totally free of error. But the argument does not persuade us that the district court\nclearly erred in relying on Dr. Lundquist's study.\nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants failed to conduct job-specific studies to determine that the CBEST is \"job\nrelated for the position[s] in question.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). The CBEST is not intended to measure all\nthe skills that are relevant to all the jobs for which it is required. (Indeed, it does not purport to measure all the\nskills of any of the jobs for which it is required.) Rather, the CBEST is intended to establish only a minimum level\nof competence in three areas of basic educational skills. The question is whether the validation studies in this\ncase have satisfied the requirement that those skills be \"job related\" for all the positions in question. The district\ncourt found that the validation studies adequately analyzed the CBEST in terms of both the teaching and\nnonteaching jobs for which the test is required. See AMAE II,937 F.Supp. at 1418-19. The district court did not\nclearly err in so finding.\n\nBoth the 1985 and the 1995 validation studies contained adequate consideration of the specific positions for\n588 which the CBEST is required. The 1985 Practitioners' *588 Review defined the positions that it analyzed as (1)\nelementary school teachers, (2) secondary school teachers, (3) librarians, counselors, and attendance officers,\nand (4) school administrators. All participants in the study were asked to judge the relevance of the CBEST skills\nby category for those jobs. Because the study's participants were asked to determine the relevance of the basic\nskills measured by the CBEST to the disparate groups of positions for which the test is required, we cannot say\nthat the district court clearly erred in finding the job analysis in the Practitioners' Review to be sufficiently specific\nand particularized.\nThe 1995 Lundquist study, as noted, identified job activities through observation, interviews, and reviews of\nspecialized literature. See id. at 1414. Dr. Lundquist then pared her list of job skills and activities through surveys\nof educators and arrived at a list of \"common skill requirements\" that were relevant for both teachers and\nadministrators. See id. at 1414-15. Her study reports:\nBasic skill ratings were examined for administrators to determine if the same skill sets applied to\nboth teacher and administrator jobs. Results showed all but one skill item (a math item) retained\nfor teachers also applied to the administrator group. Thus, the basic skill requirements identified\nfor teachers were found to be job-related for administrators as well, and the same test\nspecifications may be used to test basic skills for teachers and administrators.\nDr. Lundquist's study classified jobs for which the CBEST is required as either \"teacher\" or \"administrator\" and\ndetermined that the CBEST was valid for both groups of positions. Accordingly, the 1995 study considered the\nvalidity of the CBEST across the range of jobs for which the test is required. The district court accepted the\nstudy's conclusions and found that the CBEST had been validated adequately \"with respect to teaching and non-\nteaching jobs.\" Id. at 1418. On this record, that finding is not clearly erroneous.\nIn sum, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the skills measured by the CBEST are\n\"important element[s] of work behavior\" with regard to the jobs for which the test is required. Craig, 626 F.2d at\n662.\n3. Actual Measurement of Skills\nThe final step in this court's three-step analysis from Craig is to determine whether Defendants have\ndemonstrated by \"professionally acceptable methods that the selection device is predictive of or significantly\ncorrelated with the element of work behavior\" that it is designed to measure. See id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The district court concluded that \"the CBEST actually measures ... basic skills [in reading, writing, and\nmathematics].\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1411. Plaintiffs claim that the district court simply accepted the \"facial\"\nvalidity of the CBEST without any evidence that it actually measures the basic skills that it purports to test.\nThis court held in Contreras that \"a key requirement of [the] third step [from Craig], a requirement essential to\nproof of job relatedness generally, is that the validation method be professionally acceptable.\" 656 F.2d at 1282.\nHere, there is evidence in the record from an expert, Dr. William A. Mehrens, that supports the district court's\nfindings on this issue. Dr. Mehrens reported:\nETS [Educational Testing Service] personnel wrote some of the original items and assisted the\ntest development committees in writing other items. ETS is well known and respected as a\ndeveloper of standardized tests. They have well trained item writers and an impressive internal set\nof guidelines they follow with respect to item writing.\nWhen asked whether \"the CBEST development [was] appropriate with respect to writing and evaluating the\nitems,\" he reported:\n589 *589 It has been. Many of the items came from an existing ETS pool. Others were written\nspecifically for CBEST by members of the test development committee in concert with ETS test\ndevelopment specialists. The individuals on the committees worked with specialists from ETS to\n\nfurther develop and define the content specifications, to review an existing ETS pool test item, to\nwrite new test items, and to review the items submitted by fellow committee members. In addition,\nthe committees studied all of the data from the field testing, made recommendations for revisions\nas they felt necessary, and reviewed all final test results.\nThere also is additional evidence in the record that the test questions were \"matched\" to the skills that they were\nintended to measure. The district court referred to the \"Curriculum Matching Project, in which two ETS employees\n... matched CBEST test specifications to material found in textbooks purportedly used in the California public\nschools.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1412 n. 21. The district court was somewhat critical of this study, but noted that\n\"the study did support the overall conclusion that the kinds of skills tested on the CBEST can be found in\nelementary and secondary school textbooks.\" Id.\nIn short, there is evidence 00 even if not overwhelming evidence 00 that the development and evaluation of the\n97 97\nCBEST were appropriate and that the test measures the types of skills that it was designed to measure. We\ntherefore hold that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the test questions had been shown by\nprofessionally acceptable methods to be \"predictive of or significantly correlated with the element of work\nbehavior\" that they were designed to measure. Craig, 626 F.2d at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n[10]\nIn sum, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the CBEST was validated properly.\n4. Standards for Passing Scores\nPlaintiffs also argue that the 12-out-of-16 passing score on the writing section of the CBEST is too high.\nAccording to Plaintiffs, the 1982 Wheeler and Elias study demonstrates that the proper passing score is 9 or 10\nout of 16.\nAn employer is not required to validate separately the selection of particular passing scores on an employment\ntest. See id. at 665. Rather, the EEOC's Guidelines more generally provide: \"Where cutoff scores are used, they\nshould normally be set so as to be reasonable and consistent with normal expectations of acceptable proficiency\nwithin the work force.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1607.5(H). This court previously has applied that standard. See, e.g., Craig,\n626 F.2d at 665. In analyzing the Guidelines' scoring requirement, the Second Circuit has stated that an employer\n\"might establish a valid cutoff score by using a professional estimate of the requisite ability levels, or, at the very\nleast, by analyzing the test results to locate a logical `break-point' in the distribution of scores.\" Guardians Ass'n\nof New York City Police Dep't, Inc. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York, 630 F.2d 79, 105 (2d Cir.1980).\n590 *590 Here, the district court found that \"the passing scores on the CBEST reflect reasonable judgments about the\nminimum level of basic skills competence that should be required of teachers.\" AMAE II, 937 F.Supp. at 1420.\nThe evidence before the court revealed that the California Superintendent of Public Instruction, who was\nresponsible for establishing the cutoff scores, relied on polling data created as part of the Wheeler and Elias\nstudy in setting the cutoff for the writing section of the test. As part of that study, 44 readers reviewed\napproximately 6,800 CBEST essays and made recommendations regarding the cutoff between passing and\nfailing scores. The readers unanimously agreed that a raw score of 12 out of 16 was a \"passing\" score.\nApproximately 80 percent of the readers agreed that a score of 11 out of 16 could be a \"passing\" score. On that\nbasis, the Superintendent established a passing score of 12 out of 16, with an absolute minimum of 11 out of 16\nunder the \"compensatory scoring\" system.\nThose cutoff scores represent a \"logical breakpoint\" between passing and failing scores. Plaintiffs argue that the\nbreakpoint should have been set at 9 or 10 out of 16, because a majority of the readers opined that 10 out of 16\nwas a \"passing\" score. But the Superintendent was not required to set the score at the lowest level that a majority\nof the readers considered to be \"passing.\" Rather, he was required to set a cutoff that was logical, reasonable,\nand consistent with the data before him. He chose to set the cutoff at a level that all the readers agreed was\n\"passing,\" and to set an absolute minimum at a level that 80 percent of the readers thought was \"passing.\" The\ndistrict court found that the Superintendent's decision to set the cutoff score at that level was consistent with the\nEEOC's Guidelines. We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in so finding.\n\n[11]\nII. Title VI\nBecause we have concluded that Title VII applies to the CBEST, we need not consider whether Title VI also\napplies. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. Plaintiffs proceed on a disparate impact theory under both Title VI and Title VII.\nThus, our discussion of the merits under Title VII, and of the validation of the CBEST, would resolve Plaintiffs'\nclaims on the merits under Title VI as well. Accordingly, we decline to issue an advisory opinion on the\napplicability of Title VI.\n[12]\nIII. The District Court's Appointment of a Technical Advisor\nPlaintiffs also argue that the proceedings were tainted by the influence of Dr. Stephen Klein. Dr. Klein was\nappointed by the district court as a technical advisor, but was not called as an expert witness, was not subject to\ncross-examination, and did not furnish an expert's report.\nIn those rare cases in which outside technical expertise would be helpful to a district court, the court may appoint\na technical advisor like Dr. Klein. See Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 156 (1st Cir.1988); see also General\nElec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 149, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring) (endorsing\nthe appointment of special masters and specially trained law clerks to assist district courts with scientific or\ntechnical evidence). The court appointed Dr. Klein in an order that specifically identified him as a technical\nadvisor.\nPlaintiffs argue that the court committed legal error under Federal Rule of Evidence 706(a) by neither requiring\n591 Dr. Klein to submit a report nor allowing him to be cross-examined. The short answer *591 to Plaintiffs' argument\nis that Rule 706 applies to court-appointed expert witnesses, but not to technical advisors like Dr. Klein. See \nReilly, 863 F.2d at 155.\nAt one point in the proceedings, the district court told the parties that it intended to call Dr. Klein to testify near the\nconclusion of the trial and that the court would permit cross-examination at that time. Had the court called him,\nDr. Klein would have testified as an expert witness, and Federal Rule of Evidence 706 would have applied. But\nthe court never called Dr. Klein, and there is no indication in the record that the court relied on Dr. Klein as a\nsource of evidence. On this record, Dr. Klein acted only as a court-appointed technical advisor, and the district\ncourt did not err in refusing to allow cross-examination or to require an expert's report.\nIn his dissent, Judge Tashima agrees with us that district courts retain inherent authority to appoint technical\nadvisors in appropriate cases; that this was an appropriate case for a technical advisor; that Rule 706(a) does not\napply; and that we are reviewing for an abuse of discretion.\nHis disagreement rests on his analysis of how we should respond to the relative paucity of information in the\nrecord about Dr. Klein's interaction with the district court. In our view, the absence of any evidence even\nsuggesting an impropriety on the part of the district court militates against a conclusion that the court abused its\ndiscretion. Although it is at least possible, as Judge Tashima suggests, that \"Dr. Klein may have impermissibly\ninfluenced the court's ultimate finding,\" diss. op. at 611, we instead assume that the district court did its job\n[13]\nproperly when we lack evidence to the contrary.\nJudge Tashima also proposes a list of procedures for district courts to follow when appointing technical advisors.\nEven assuming that those procedures are appropriate, the district court did not have the benefit of Judge\nTashima's dissent before this trial, and we will not fault the court for failing to foresee his recommendations. We\nare not willing to find an abuse of discretion and to undo this entire trial because the district court did not follow a\nset of guidelines that are required nowhere in the rules or relevant case law.\n\n[14]\nIV. The District Court's Refusal to Award Costs\nDefendants appeal from the district court's order denying their cost bill in the amount of $216,443.67. Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) provides that \"costs other than attorneys' fees shall be allowed as of course to\nthe prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\" By its terms, the rule creates a presumption in favor of\nawarding costs to a prevailing party, but vests in the district court discretion to refuse to award costs. See \nNational Info. Servs., Inc. v. TRW, Inc., 51 F.3d 1470, 1471 (9th Cir.1995).\nThat discretion is not unlimited. A district court must \"specify reasons\" for its refusal to award costs. Subscription\n592 Television, Inc. v. Southern Cal. Theatre Owners Ass'n, 576 F.2d 230, 234 (9th Cir. *592 1978). On appeal, we\ndetermine whether the reasons that the district court has specified are appropriate and whether, considering\nthose reasons, the court abused its discretion in denying costs. See National Info. Servs., 51 F.3d at 1471-72.\nIn past cases, this court has approved the following reasons for refusing to award costs to a prevailing party: the\nlosing party's limited financial resources, see National Org. for Women v. Bank of Cal., 680 F.2d 1291, 1294 (9th\nCir.1982); see also Wrighten v. Metropolitan Hosps., Inc., 726 F.2d 1346, 1358 (9th Cir.1984); Moore v. Hughes\nHelicopters, Inc., 708 F.2d 475, 486 (9th Cir.1983); and misconduct on the part of the prevailing party, see \nNational Info. Servs., 51 F.3d at 1472. Further, in Stanley v. University of Southern California, 178 F.3d 1069,\n1079-80 (9th Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 120 S.Ct. 533, 145 L.Ed.2d 413 (1999), we held that the district\ncourt abused its discretion in denying a losing civil rights plaintiff's motion to re-tax costs without considering (1)\nthe plaintiff's limited financial resources; and (2) \"the chilling effect of imposing such high costs on future civil\nrights litigants.\"\nHere, the district court gave four reasons for denying costs to Defendants: (1) the case \"involve[s] issues of\nsubstantial public importance,\" specifically \"educational quality, interracial disparities in economic opportunity, and\naccess to positions of social influence\"; (2) there is great economic disparity between Plaintiffs, who are\nindividuals and \"small nonprofit educational organizations,\" and the State of California; (3) the issues in the case\n[15]\nare close and difficult;  and (4) Plaintiffs' case, although unsuccessful, had some merit, as evidenced by the\n1995 modification of the CBEST to eliminate \"higher order\" mathematics questions.\nDefendants argue that the district court's reasons for denying costs were improper. According to Defendants, this\ncourt's opinion in National Information Services establishes that the only proper reason for denying costs to a\nprevailing party is to punish misconduct by that party. We disagree.\nAs noted, this court previously has held that district courts may consider other, nonpunitive reasons for denying\ncosts to a prevailing party. National Information Services does appear to suggest that such a denial is proper only\nas a means of punishing a prevailing but undeserving litigant. See also Zenith Ins. Co. v. Breslaw, 108 F.3d 205,\n207-08 (9th Cir.1997) (following National Information Services). But that suggestion is inconsistent with earlier\nopinions of this court, see, e.g., National Org. for Women, 680 F.2d at 1294, opinions that National Information\nServices, as a panel's opinion, could not (and did not purport to) overrule.\nMore importantly, we see no basis for limiting district courts' discretion in the manner that Defendants suggest.\nThe rule itself contains no such limitation; it provides simply that costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party\nunless the district court \"otherwise directs.\" The requirement that district courts give reasons for denying costs\n593 flows logically from the presumption *593 in favor of costs that is embodied in the text of the rule; if a district court\nwishes to depart from that presumption, it must explain why \"so that the appellate court will be able to determine\nwhether or not the trial court abused its discretion.\" Subscription Television, 576 F.2d at 234. But the limitation on\ndistrict courts' discretion that Defendants advocate curtails that discretion in a manner and to a degree that are\ninappropriate in view of the broad wording of the rule. We now overrule National Information Services to the\nextent that it held that only misconduct may support the denial of costs to a prevailing party.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) establishes that costs are to be awarded as a matter of course in the\nordinary case. Our requirement that a district court give reasons for denying costs is, in essence, a requirement\nthat the court explain why a case is not \"ordinary\" and why, in the circumstances, it would be inappropriate or\n\ninequitable to award costs. Misconduct on the part of the prevailing party is one factor that might render a case\n\"extraordinary.\" But it is not the only such factor. Here, the reasons that the district court gave for denying costs\nreflect what is clear at a glance: This is an extraordinary, and extraordinarily important, case. Plaintiffs are a\ngroup of individuals and nonprofit organizations. The record demonstrates that their resources are limited. They\nhave brought an action that presents issues of the gravest public importance, and the action affects tens of\nthousands of Californians and the state's public school system as a whole. The issues in the case are close and\ncomplex. Although Plaintiffs have not prevailed in this action, their claims are not without merit. Indeed, as the\ndistrict court pointed out, Defendants substantially altered the CBEST during the pendency of this litigation.\nFinally, costs in this case are extraordinarily high. In keeping with our decision in Stanley, we note that divesting\ndistrict courts of discretion to limit or to refuse such overwhelming costs in important, close, but ultimately\nunsuccessful civil rights cases like this one might have the regrettable effect of discouraging potential plaintiffs\nfrom bringing such cases at all.\nWe do not mean to suggest that the presumption in favor of awarding costs to prevailing parties does not apply to\ndefendants in civil rights actions. Nor are we attempting to create an exhaustive list of \"good reasons\" for\ndeclining to award costs. We simply hold that the reasons that the district court gave for refusing to award costs\nin this case were appropriate under Rule 54(d)(1) and that, considering those reasons, the court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in refusing to award costs to Defendants.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated, we hold that Title VII applies to the CBEST; that the CBEST was validated properly; that\nthe district court permissibly used a technical advisor; and that the district court did not abuse its discretion by\nrefusing to award costs to Defendants. Accordingly, we affirm both the judgment in Defendants' favor and the\norder denying them costs.\nAFFIRMED.\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge, with whom Circuit Judges SCHROEDER and THOMAS join, concurring in part and\ndissenting in part:\nThe result we reach is most unfortunate. Not only is it wrong as a matter of law, but it may lead some to conclude\nthat we are insensitive to the needs and problems of minority educators and minority students. While that may\nnot be so, one thing is certain. The loser in the case before us is clearly the already beleaguered public education\nsystem of the state of California.\n594 Although I concur in Section IA and Parts II, III, and IV of the majority opinion, I cannot agree with the majority's \n*594 holding that the CBEST was properly validated under Title VII. As a result of this ruling, qualified minority\neducators 00 teachers, administrators, librarians, and other officials 00 will be denied the opportunity to work in\n97 97\nCalifornia's severely under-staffed public schools, simply because they failed to pass a test that concededly has a\ndisparate impact on minority group members. Despite Title VII's clear requirement that a test that has a disparate\nimpact on minorities must be validated by reference to a particular job, the majority accepts validation studies that\nfail to differentiate among different school jobs, ranging from bilingual education teachers to mathematics\nteachers to physical education teachers. Further, even though Title VII demands that the defendants demonstrate\n\"by professionally acceptable methods\" that the test items are predictive of or significantly correlated to job-\nrelated skills, the majority finds that the CBEST met this requirement through a study that the district court found\nto be \"unscientific\" and \"not particularly helpful.\"\nA sampling of the plaintiff class illustrates the disservice the majority decision does not only to minority educators\nbut also to the students in the California public school system. The plaintiff class includes a Cambodian-born\napplicant with a postgraduate teacher preparation certificate and a Bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies from a\nCalifornia State University, who is seeking to teach bilingual elementary school classes to address the needs of\nover 24,000 Khmer-speaking students in California public schools. He is qualified but for the fact that he is four\npoints short of obtaining the required score on the reading section of the CBEST. The class also includes a Latino\nresident of Los Angeles County, in which Latinos comprise the largest ethnic group. The man seeks a position as\n\na counselor in the public schools, and has an undergraduate degree from University of California at Irvine and a\nMaster's degree in Counseling from California State University at Los Angeles, but has failed the reading section\nof the CBEST. He too is qualified, but for the test. Another class member is an African-American Assistant\nPrincipal and physical education teacher with a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in Physical Education\nfrom Stanford, who was promoted from his position as a teacher to Assistant Principal, and who received\nexcellent performance reviews as an Assistant Principal. He has been denied the opportunity to return to his post\nas Assistant Principal because he is six points short of passing the math portion of the CBEST. The result of the\nfailure to validate the CBEST in a lawful manner is to perpetuate discrimination against minority teachers who\ncould be of particular assistance to minority students and serve as role models for them. It is significant in this\nregard that minority students outnumber white students in many of California's largest school districts, in some\ncases by substantial amounts.\nAs the majority notes, we follow the three-step approach set forth in Craig v. County of Los Angeles, 626 F.2d\n659, 662 (9th Cir.1980) to determine whether a test is job related. I believe that the district court erred in applying\nthe second and third steps of the Craig test, because (1) the studies relied on by the CTC (Commission on\nTeacher Credentialing) do not differentiate among different school jobs in determining the skills to be tested; and\n(2) the studies do not demonstrate by professionally acceptable methods that the test items actually measure the\njob-related skills identified by the CTC. Either of these errors in the method of validation would be sufficient to\nrender the CBEST invalid. Finally, although I believe that the district court's determination of job-relatedness\nshould be reversed even under the clear error standard adopted by the majority, the proper standard for\nreviewing the determinations at issue in this case is de novo.\nI. Failure to validate for separate jobs\n595 The use of a test that has a disparate impact under Title VII is impermissible *595 unless it is proven that the test\nis \"job related for the position in question.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added). The Uniform\nGuidelines provide that \"[a]ny validity study should be based upon a review of information about the job for which\nthe selection procedure is to be used.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1607.14(A). The CBEST is invalid because it was not\nvalidated with specific reference to the various particular jobs for which the CBEST is used.\nThe Supreme Court clarified the job-specific validation requirement in Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, holding\nthat \"[a] test may be used in jobs other than those for which it has been professionally validated only if there are\nno significant differences between the studied and unstudied jobs.\" 422 U.S. 405, 432, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d\n280 (1975). In Albemarle, employment tests designed to measure general intelligence were administered to ten\ndifferent job groups, which were primarily grouped together on the basis of their proximity to each other in the line\nof progression, rather than in terms of the specific skills that the jobs required. Id. at 429-30, 95 S.Ct. 2362. The\nCourt held the tests invalid in part because the validation study focused on higher-skilled positions on the\nproduction lines without adequately examining whether the tests were valid for workers entering lower level jobs. \nId. at 433-34, 95 S.Ct. 2362. Further, the Court noted that one of the tests required for the skilled lines of\nprogression correlated to job performance in only three of the eight lines at issue. Id. at 431, 95 S.Ct. 2362.\nBecause the study had not shown that there were \"no significant differences\" between the various jobs this test\npurported to evaluate, the test was held invalid. Id. at 432, 95 S.Ct. 2362.\nWe required a similar level of job specificity in Craig, which involved, in relevant part, a height requirement for\nprospective sheriffs. Craig, 626 F.2d at 666-68. Although the height requirement was justified by reference to the\nneed for officers to \"command respect,\" we rejected the generalization that \"all police officers expend a significant\nportion of their time and effort in confrontation and control conditions\" because \"[n]o study proved the\ngeneralization to be a fact.\" Craig, 626 F.2d at 667. We therefore required the defendants to validate the\nrequirement by reference to more than a general description of a police officer's functions, because different\npolice officers have different duties. Other circuits have also rejected attempts to use a single test to measure\n[1]\nskills for jobs that were generally similar but had appreciably different specific duties.\nThe CBEST was validated without regard to the important differences among the various jobs at issue, which\nrange from twelfth grade mathematics teachers to seventh grade bilingual education teachers to guidance\n\ncounselors, librarians, and administrators. The 1982 Wheeler and Elias study encompassed skills relevant to the\njob of \"teaching at any grade level;\" the 1985 Practioner's Review study divided the \"particular jobs\" into four\ngroups, specifically (1) elementary school teachers, (2) secondary school teachers, (3) pupil personnel and\nlibrarians, and (4) administrators; and the Lundquist study divided the pool into teachers and administrators.\n596 Thus, even the study that provided the *596 most specific analysis of job categories did not differentiate among\nthe job duties of bilingual education teachers, mathematics teachers, and physical education teachers, for\nexample.\nThe majority states that the CBEST establishes only \"a minimum level of competence\" in skills that are job\nrelated for all the positions in question. While it may be possible to construct a test that measures skills relevant\nfor all teachers, Albemarle holds that such a test may only be used if it has been validated for each \"particular\njob\" involved or if there are \"no significant differences\" among the jobs at issue. Albemarle, 422 U.S. at 432, 95\nS.Ct. 2362. The positions at issue in AMAE bear less resemblance to each other than those in Craig, Albemarle,\nor the cases from other circuits. If a validation study must differentiate between different officers in the sheriff's\ndepartment or workers on different lines at the paper production factory, it is certainly improper for the CBEST to\nbe validated by reference to undifferentiated but significantly different teaching jobs. A validation study that\nfocuses on the \"particular job\" of \"a teacher\" or even \"a secondary school teacher\" fails to satisfy the legal\nrequirement that the examination predict job performance for each particular job position in question. Teachers'\njobs are too diverse to be lumped into one or two categories for validation purposes. There is no legal or logical\nbasis to support the majority's abandonment of the job-specific validation requirement employed in Albemarle\nand Craig. In doing so, it clearly erred.\nII. Failure to match test items to skills important to the job\nAs the majority notes, the third step of the Craig test requires employers to \"demonstrate by `professionally\nacceptable methods' that the selection device is `predictive of or significantly correlated' with the element of work\nbehavior identified [by the job analysis].\" Craig, 626 F.2d at 662 (quoting Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 431, 95\nS.Ct. 2362). In other words, the employer must demonstrate not only that the skills identified in the job analysis\nare job related, but also that the test items actually measure those skills. In Contreras v. City of Los Angeles, for\nexample, this requirement was satisfied by an independent \"examination review phase\" in which a new group of\njob experts reviewed each test question and decided whether it tested one of the critical elements identified in the\npreceding \"job analysis\" phase. 656 F.2d 1267, 1282 (9th Cir.1981); cf. Craig, 626 F.2d at 667 (finding that\ntestimony from the sheriff and a physical training instructor that height was important in commanding respect and\napplying restraint was insufficient to show by professionally acceptable methods that the height requirements\nwere predictive of the ability to carry out the \"control functions\" of the job). As the majority acknowledges, \"a key\nrequirement of [the] third step, a requirement essential to the proof of job relatedness, is that the validation\nmethod be professionally acceptable.\" Contreras, 656 F.2d at 1282. Here, even assuming that the job analysis\nwas sufficiently specific to generate skills important for all the positions in question, the CBEST is invalid because\nthe CTC failed to demonstrate in a professionally acceptable manner that the test actually measures the skills\nidentified in the job analysis.\nThe majority appears to concede that neither the Practitioner's Review study nor the Lundquist study attempted\nto match the test items to the job skills as required under Craig. Maj. op. at 589. To support the district court's\nfinding of validity, the majority cites evidence describing the process of test development employed by ETS.\nHowever, this evidence merely purports to show that the test items were expertly developed; it does not\ndemonstrate, as the third step of the Craig test requires, that the final version of the CBEST administered to job\n597 applicants is \"predictive of or significantly correlated\" with the skills identified in the job analysis *597 as important\nfor the job. Where an employer seeks to use a test that has a disparate impact on minorities, it must present\nevidence that the test actually measures the skills that have been identified as important for the job, and may not\nrely solely on the fact that it used a \"well known and respected as a developer of standardized tests.\" Maj. op. at\n588 (quoting the report of Dr. William A. Mehrens).\nAs evidence that the test questions were \"matched\" to the skills they were intended to measure, the majority\npoints only to the Curriculum Matching Project, in which two ETS employees matched CBEST test specifications\n\nto material found in textbooks purportedly used in California public schools. The district court criticized this study\nas \"unscientific\" and \"not particularly helpful,\" but nevertheless upheld the test. AMAE v. State of California, 937\nF.Supp. 1397, 1412 n. 21 (N.D.Cal.1996). We have explicitly held that it is \"essential\" that the item validation\nmethod be professionally acceptable. Contreras, 656 F.2d at 1282. \"Unscientific\" and \"not particularly helpful\"\ntests clearly do not meet that standard. Thus, even under a clear error standard, the district court's determination\nthat step three of the Craig test was satisfied requires reversal.\nIII. Standard of review\nIt is plain from a reading of the majority's opinion that it is heavily influenced by the fact that we are reviewing\ndistrict court determinations that it believes to be of some complexity. Indeed, in oral argument, the state relied\nalmost exclusively on the fact that the district court had considered the matter carefully and reached its\nconclusions following a long trial. This may have caused the majority to fail to examine sufficiently the legal\ninadequacies of the validation studies pointed out in the preceding sections of this dissent.\nAt each step in its analysis of job-relatedness, the majority emphasizes that the district court's determination was\nnot clearly erroneous. However, as the majority recognizes, courts have not discussed the appropriate standard\nof review for a district court's ruling on test validation issues. In fact, the standard of review here should be the\nsame as it was in Albemarle and Craig, where the Supreme Court and this court reversed a district court's\ndetermination that a test was valid based on errors in the application of the job-relatedness test similar to those\ncommitted by the district court here. At no point did either court suggest that the clearly erroneous test applied.\nAlthough I believe that the district court's determination of job relatedness should be reversed regardless of the\napplicable standard of review, the proper standard is de novo. The majority fails to separate errors regarding the\napplication of the various prongs of the Craig test, which involve primarily legal issues, from errors regarding the\nunderlying factual evaluations of expert testimony and statistical significance. The errors here fall in the former\ncategory and are therefore subject to de novo review. See United States v. McConney, 728 F.2d 1195, 1201 (9th\n[2]\nCir.1984) (en banc).\n598  IV. Conclusion\n*598\nThe defendants failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the CBEST, with its discriminatory impact, is job\nrelated. The studies relied on by the CTC to validate the test did not differentiate among different teaching jobs,\nand the CTC did not demonstrate by professionally acceptable methods that the test items actually measured the\nskills identified in the job analysis. Title VII's requirement that tests be validated properly must be vigilantly\nenforced to ensure that tests that have a disparate impact on minorities are used only if they are job related for\nthe position in question and if no alternative nondiscriminatory selection device exists. Plaintiffs' challenge to the\nCBEST implicates one of the most important objectives of Title VII 00 preventing employers from erecting arbitrary\n97\nbarriers which interfere with minority access to employment opportunities. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S.\n424, 432, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971). By erroneously affirming the district court's decision, we allow the\nState of California to perpetuate discrimination against qualified minority teachers, who are already seriously\nunderrepresented in the California public school system, and, derivatively, against minority students as well. In\nthe end, all Californians are the victims of the discriminatory tests the majority upholds. I respectfully dissent.\n[1]\nFERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge, with whom RYMER, Circuit Judge, joins, Concurring in part and Dissenting  in\npart:\nI concur in the majority opinion with the exception of part IV, where the majority determines that a district court\ncan refuse to award costs to the prevailing party simply because the court decides that the losing parties do not\nhave much money, and are worthy because they have presented an important issue which is close and has some\nmerit. As to that, I dissent.\nTo my mind, reasoning along that line bespeaks an improper bias in favor of plaintiffs. If the issue is important,\nboth sides have a hand in seeing to it that the true public interest is vindicated, and, as it turns out, a defendant\n\nmay well be the party correctly representing that public interest. Here we deal with the public's interest in having\ncompetent people running its schools and teaching its children, and Defendants showed that it is Plaintiffs who\nerred when they incorrectly thought that a competency test was overly burdensome and improper. That is to say,\nPlaintiffs' claim that they and those they represent should not have to meet the minimal competency requirements\nof the CBEST was wrong. The public interest has been vindicated, but not by them. Rather, Defendants properly\nrepresented the public's desires and aspirations for California's children. They were right, and should not be\ndenied their costs.\nThus, I support the reasoning found in National Information Services, Inc. v. TRW, Inc., 51 F.3d 1470, 1471 (9th\nCir. 1995), which recognized, as does the majority opinion, that \"Rule 54(d)(1) creates a presumption in favor of\nawarding costs to the prevailing party.\" Because of that strong presumption, \"[a] district court therefore generally\nmust award costs unless the prevailing party is guilty of some fault, misconduct, or default worthy of punishment.\"\nId. at 1472; see also Zenith Ins. Co. v. Breslaw, 108 F.3d 205, 207 (9th Cir.1997). As we noted in National\nInformation Services, 51 F.3d at 1471, it does not matter that the plaintiff sued in good faith and with no vexatious\n599 purpose, and *599 even raised \"`important and intricate' legal questions and included claims that were `not\nmeritless.'\" That is no reason to punish the defendant.\n[2]\nWhen a prevailing party is denied costs, that party is punished,  but the punishment should not be exacted\nunless \"the party has done something to deserve it.\" Id. at 1472. Of course, the district court should have broad\nequitable discretion to decide whether the prevailing party \"deserves it,\" but that is where the discretion should\n[3]\ngenerally  stop. Therefore, all of the other reasons cited by the district court and the majority to justify denying\ncosts to the prevailing parties in this case are improper. They, in fact, represent an abuse of discretion by the\ndistrict court.\nThe majority opinion correctly notes that some of our prior decisions have upheld district courts' decisions to deny\ncosts to the prevailing parties on the basis of the losing parties' limited financial conditions. See, e.g., Wrighten v.\nMetropolitan Hospitals, Inc., 726 F.2d 1346, 1358 (9th Cir. 1984); Moore v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., 708 F.2d\n475, 486 (9th Cir.1983); National Organization for Women v. Bank of California, 680 F.2d 1291, 1294 (9th\nCir.1982). However, they did so without much explanation, and, unlike the majority, I would overrule those\ndecisions instead of National Information Services.\n[4]\nThe fact, if it is a fact,  that Plaintiffs do not have access to much money is hardly a good reason to allow them\nto impose enormous costs upon Defendants, which have shown themselves to have been correct in the first\nplace. I see nothing especially extraordinary about plaintiffs who are of modest means but still sufficiently well\nfunded to carry out lengthy litigation. I see no reason to encourage them to cause great expense to their\nadversaries, safe in the knowledge that there is little downside to their efforts. Again, that is why this court has\nproperly \"recognized that denial of Rule 54(d) costs operates to punish the prevailing party for some impropriety\nduring the course of litigation,\" and should otherwise be eschewed. Zenith, 108 F.3d at 207; see also Cherry v.\nChampion Intern. Corp., 186 F.3d 442, 447-48 (4th Cir. 1999) (holding that there should not be an exception to\nthe presumption in favor of awarding costs to prevailing party because losing plaintiff is of \"modest means,\" and\ndisparity of resources is likewise an improper basis); Smith v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Authority, 47\nF.3d 97, 100 (3d Cir.1995) (holding that disparity in financial resources between the parties is not a valid basis to\nexempt losing party from paying costs).\nNor should it matter that Defendants are public entities. See Smith, 47 F.3d at 99 (denying costs would be unfair\nto taxpayers who subsidize prevailing defendant); Burroughs v. Hills, 741 F.2d 1525, 1538 (7th Cir.1984) (Posner,\n600 J., concurring) (The plaintiffs' limited means claim \"is entitled *600 to little weight in a case such as this where the\ndefendants are... public officials whose expenses of suit were borne by the United States, which is to say by the\nfederal taxpayer. Most taxpayers are persons of limited means; most government revenue is raised from such\npersons, and not from the wealthy few. The denial of costs to the defendants in this case will not contribute,\nhowever slightly, to a more egalitarian distribution of the nation's wealth.\").\nI find it regrettable that the majority is using this case for the purpose of overruling National Information Services\nand enshrining a kind of plaintiffs-are-good-defendants-are-not test in its place. While the majority does not\nspecifically say that it is taking that position, the denial of costs to Defendants surely has that effect. That is most\n\nunfortunate. See Mitchell v. City of Moore, 218 F.3d 1190, 1204 (10th Cir. 2000) (rejecting argument that\n\"presumption in favor of costs should be relaxed when the prevailing party is the defendant in a civil rights case\");\nCherry, 186 F.3d at 448 (holding that presumptive award of costs to prevailing party cannot be overcome\nbecause of \"public interest\" nature of the litigation); Contreras, 119 F.3d at 1295 (holding that civil rights plaintiffs\ndo not warrant special treatment with respect to payment of costs to prevailing party); Jones, 789 F.2d at 1233\n(same). In many cases, it is inequitable to require prevailing parties to bear their own attorney's fees. National\nInformation Services' holding that unless the prevailing parties did something wrong, we should not impose the\nfurther inequity of depriving them of costs may not be all encompassingly perfect. However, it is much closer to\nperfect than the position we now adopt.\nThus, while I agree with most of the fine majority opinion, I must respectfully dissent from its decision regarding\ncosts.\nKLEINFELD, Circuit Judge, with whom Circuit Judge O'SCANNLAIN joins, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart.\nI join in parts I(B), II, and III of Judge Graber's opinion, but not parts I(A) or IV; in part II of Judge Gould's opinion\nbut not part I; that part of Judge Fernandez's opinion dissenting on costs but not his concurrence in part I(A) of\nJudge Graber's opinion. That is to say, I agree with Judge Graber that the test was adequately validated and did\nnot violate the Civil Rights Act. And I agree that the judgment does not need to be vacated because of the district\ncourt's use of an in-chambers expert (though Judge Tashima's concerns strike me as valid, and I might join in his\nview were I not confident that the result has to be the same regardless of the ex parte advice from the judge-\nselected expert). I agree with Judge Gould's dissent on whether Title VII applies. And I agree with Judge\nFernandez that we should reverse the denial of costs.\nI write separately for two related reasons. First, without at least a paragraph like the one above (and a scorecard\nto keep track of such paragraphs), readers of the opinion cannot figure out who stands where, and what the\ncount is. So I have to write something. Second, our decision on whether Title VII applies, which generates most\nof our division (and the need for so incomprehensible a sentence as the one with which I begin this separate\nopinion), is entirely unnecessary and could better be avoided. We are not bound to avoid deciding, as we would\n[1] [2]\nbe with a constitutional question,  but it would be preferable for us to avoid deciding.\n601 *601 The way to avoid deciding the issue of whether Title VII applies is the obvious and traditional formula:\n\"Assuming without deciding whether Title VII applies, we conclude that it was not violated, because this test does\nnot discriminate in violation of that law.\" I would have preferred that we had used that formula.\nThe reason why I advocate such avoidance is not the difficulty of the question. Judge Gould's analysis is\ncompelling and clearly correct. Congress prohibited discrimination by employers with respect to employees. The\ndefendants do not employ the plaintiffs or those whom the plaintiffs represent. So the Title VII prohibition does not\nspeak to the situation.\nCongress adopted the Civil Rights Act of 1964 after one of the great legislative battles of our time. It did not\nchoose to impose the expense of justifying tests and other actions that affect employability on third parties other\nthan employers. The country suffered from massive direct and intentional race discrimination at that time.\nConsidering the political challenge that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 posed for its advocates, and the skill and\nconsumption of political capital it required of such great men as President Lyndon Johnson, Senator Hubert\nHumphrey, and Senator Everett Dirksen, we cannot assume that Congress would have gone any further than it\ndid. Reading statutes as if they said what they do not say, in order to go further than the legislature did, vitiates\ncareful legislative compromises. If we do not respect the compromises legislators make, how shall they be\ninduced to make them? \"If we were to `fully effectuate' what we take to be the underlying policy of the legislation,\nwithout careful attention to the qualifying words in the statute, then we would be overturning the nuanced\ncompromise in the legislation, and substituting our own cruder, less responsive mandate for the law that was\n[3]\nactually passed.\"  Those who only got half a loaf from Congress frequently come to the federal courts for the\nother half, but their mail ought to be forwarded to Capitol Hill.\n\nThere are several reasons why it would be better for us to avoid deciding whether Title VII applies. One is that\ndeciding the issue reduces the collegiality of our decision. By \"collegiality\" I do not mean civility or good feeling\namong colleagues, meanings sometimes inferred from the word. I mean the dictionary definition, \"shared\n[4]\nauthority among colleagues,\"  so that we meld our individual voices into the voice of the court. An appellate\ncourt ought to speak collectively as nearly as possible, particularly when it speaks with the force of an en banc\ndecision. In my experience, the way votes are accumulated for a collegial decision is mainly by deletion of\nmatters not essential to the result, and on which there is disagreement.\nIn this case, the decision on whether Title VII applies is not essential to the result. Of the eleven judges on this en\nbanc panel, nine agree that, whether Title VII applies or not, the test was adequately validated and would not\nviolate Title VII. We could simply stop there. If the test is appropriate even if administered by an \"employer,\" as\nthe district court found and nine of us would affirm, then we need not decide whether a non-employer state board\nshould be treated as if it were an employer for purposes of Title VII.\nThere are quite a few reasons why such collegiality is desirable. One is that the law is hard to figure out when a\nreader needs a scorecard to count votes on an issue by issue basis. It is much easier to know what the law is\nfrom Chief Justice Marshall's unanimous opinions, than from the old English Reports with individual judges'\n602 opinions reported seriatim. Careful *602 jurists can fall into disagreement on how to keep score.[5] When we do\ndecide on an issue, despite the decision being inessential to the result, there is necessarily a question of whether\nour decision is mere dictum. The traditional definition of obiter dictum is a \"remark by the way\" or as \"[s]tatements\nand comments in an opinion concerning some rule of law or legal proposition not necessarily involved nor\n[6]\nessential to determination of the case in hand ... and lack the force of an adjudication.\"  Our resolution of\ninessential issues invites more litigation.\nIn this case, our reaching out to hold that Title VII applies to non-employers opens the door to more litigation,\ninstead of shutting it. We have now created a circuit split on a national issue of great importance. As Judge Gould\npoints out, all the other circuits to have ruled on whether Title VII (or the analogously construed ADEA provision)\napplies to non-employers such as state licensing boards have gone the other way. In a schools case in the\n[7] [8]\nSeventh Circuit,  a veterinary board case out of the Third,  and most closely analogous, a school teacher\n[9]\nstate certification examination case out of the Fifth,  our sister circuits have gone the other way. (So have we,\n[10]\nfor that matter, in a dental board case. ) Though the majority opinion struggles to distinguish these cases, it is\nindeed a struggle, and the distinction is not solid enough for any state licensing board to rest on. A decision like\ntoday's, where we set up an inter-circuit conflict on a matter of great national importance, is colloquially known\namong those of us who do appellate law for a living as \"cert bait.\" That is to say, we have furnished the Supreme\nCourt with a reason to grant a petition for certiorari. As soon as we file our opinion, the highly capable lawyers\ninvolved will start calling around to arrange meetings relating to the certiorari petition and amicus briefs.\nThe majority opinion today says that we ought to decide the Title VII applicability issue because it is logical, but\nthere is nothing illogical about assuming without deciding. In the study of logic, assuming without deciding is\n[11]\ntermed \"conditional,\" \"if p then q.\"  Just as it is perfectly logical to say \"if today is Thursday then tomorrow is\nFriday,\" without saying whether today is Thursday, it is perfectly logical to say that \"if Title VII applies, it is\nsatisfied,\" without saying whether Title VII applies.\nThe majority also says we should decide the Title VII issue even though we do not have to reach it, because the\nparties probably want to know the answer, particularly the State of California. Somehow I doubt that the State of\nCalifornia really wants to know that now it may have to spend hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of dollars,\nand years of litigation, validating examinations and possibly all the other screening it does of all licensed\nprofessions. More likely, both sides just wanted to win this case and establish either that the CBEST examination\nwas or was not permissible. These are school people. They probably care about schools, and want a final answer\nabout the CBEST examination. We have undercut the finality of the answer by reaching out for \"cert bait.\"\n603 *603 There is another, and to my mind, especially important reason why we ought to avoid deciding this question\non which we disagree. We may be wrong. On anything, we can be wrong. I am fairly confident that Judge Gould\n\nis right about Title VII, but I could be wrong. The scope and applicability of Title VII is an exceedingly important,\nand always controversial, question. Because we are not elected and always in every circumstance run a\nsubstantial risk of being wrong, the less we govern the better. That is not to say we should dodge the\ncontroversial. If the law is established and the facts show a violation, we are obligated to apply the law without\nregard to whether it is controversial. But we should restrain ourselves from deciding important public policy\nissues, when they are unnecessary to decision in the matter before us, we lack a consensus, all the other circuits\nto have decided them have gone the other way, and the law we establish is not clearly compelled. The people\ncan govern themselves.\nAll that said, I am not going to make the score even harder to keep by withholding my judgment. We have\nreached the Title VII issue whether I like it or not. I cannot prevent us from reaching it. So I join Judge Gould in\nconcluding that it does not apply because the lawsuit is not against the relevant employer.\n[1]\nGOULD, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting  in part:\nI\nI concur in Parts II, III, and IV of the majority's opinion, and in the judgment. I write separately, however, to dissent\nfrom Part I and to express my view to the contrary that Title VII does not apply to the CBEST. The majority\nextends the reach of Title VII far beyond what Congress intended and in so doing creates potential mischief for all\n[2]\nof our states.\nII\nSection 703(a)(1) of Title VII provides, in relevant part:\n(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer 00\n97\n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment....\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).\nA natural reading of this section suggests that the \"individual\" it references is a potential, current, or past\nemployee of the employer. That is the typical Title VII case. See, e.g., Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.,\n523 U.S. 75, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998); Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126\nL.Ed.2d 295 (1993); Ansonia Bd. of Educ. v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 107 S.Ct. 367, 93 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986); \nAlbemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975); Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,\n401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971).\nHowever, in a line of cases beginning with Sibley Memorial Hospital v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir.1973),\nmany courts 00 including this one 00 have extended Title VII liability to employers who discriminatorily interfere with\n97 97\nan individual's employment relationship with a third party. See id. at 1341; see also Gomez v. Alexian Bros.\nHosp., 698 F.2d 1019, 1021 (9th Cir.1983). To extend Title VII's reach in this way requires not only an unnatural\nreading of the statute, but also a dubious inference about Congress' intent in enacting it. If Congress had\n604 intended to create liability for interference with third-party employment relationships, *604 there is no discernable\nreason why it would have limited that liability to \"employers,\" as defined in Title VII. See, e.g., Ehret v. Louisiana,\n862 F.Supp. 1546, 1550 (E.D.La.1992) (voluntary association of river pilots that interfered with third party\nemployment relationship not subject to Sibley liability because it was not an \"employer\"). As the Seventh Circuit\nhas noted:\nIt might be a good idea to impose liability on those who aid or abet violations of [anti-discrimination\nlaws such as Title VII], but what sense would it make to confine that liability to persons or firms\nthat happen to be employers? Since it would make very little sense that we can see, ... we find it\n\nimplausible to impute to Congress an intention to create, by language not at all suggestive of any\nsuch intention, aider and abettor liability of one employer to the employees of another employer.\n[3]\nEEOC v. Illinois, 69 F.3d 167, 169 (7th Cir.1995).\nThis interpretation of the statute under Sibley and Gomez when applied to private employers at least advances\nthe purpose of Title VII to eradicate discrimination in the workplace, and is consistent with the general directive\nthat courts construe the statute broadly to effectuate that purpose. See Duffield v. Robertson Stephens & Co.,\n144 F.3d 1182, 1192 (9th Cir.1998).\nIII\nThe same cannot be said, however, of the majority's further extension of Title VII to impose indirect liability on the\n[4]\nState of California.  The Supreme Court repeatedly has admonished that, absent a clear expression of\ncongressional intent, courts must not interpret federal statutes as creating \"in-roads by implication on state\nauthority\" to exercise what have historically been state police powers. Palmer v. Massachusetts, 308 U.S. 79, 84,\n60 S.Ct. 34, 84 L.Ed. 93 (1939); see also Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 65, 109 S.Ct. 2304,\n105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Numerous courts have recognized that Sibley's liberal reading of the statute cannot\nextend Title VII liability to states that, in the course of exercising their police powers in good faith, may indirectly\naffect employment prospects. In Haddock v. Board of Dental Examiners, 777 F.2d 462 (9th Cir.1985), for\nexample, this court correctly observed that there is no evidence that when Congress amended Title VII to apply to\nstate governments, it \"intended to benefit anyone other than those actually employed by state governments or\ntheir subdivisions.\" Id. at 464 (emphasis added). We thus held that Title VII did not apply to the licensing activities\nof the California State Board of Dental Examiners. See id. Virtually all other courts to have considered Title VII's\npossible application to state licensing activities and to other exercises of traditional police powers have reached\nthe same conclusion. See, e.g., Fields v. Hallsville Indep. Sch. Dist., 906 F.2d 1017, 1020 (5th Cir.1990); George\n605 v. New Jersey Bd. of Veterinary Med. Exam'rs, 794 F.2d 113, 114 (3d Cir.1986); United States v. New York State\n*605Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 82 F.Supp.2d 42, 51 (E.D.N.Y.2000); National Org. of Women v. Waterfront\nComm'n of New York Harbor, 468 F.Supp. 317, 320 (S.D.N.Y.1979); see also EEOC v. Illinois, 69 F.3d at 171\n(because state regulation of teaching, even though pervasive, is exercise of police powers, Sibley liability does\nnot apply).\nThe majority's holding in Part I.A strays from these cases and is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's controlling\nlaw and mandate on which they rest. It also creates a striking conflict among the circuits on an issue of\nimportance to our states, is discordant with basic principles of federalism, and is unworkable in practice.\nA\nThe Supreme Court has consistently held that the establishment and regulation of a public school system lies at\nthe core of a state's historic police powers; it is quintessentially a governmental, not a proprietary function. See \nWisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 213, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (\"Providing public schools ranks at\nthe very apex of the function of a State.\"); Hadley v. Junior College Dist., 397 U.S. 50, 56, 90 S.Ct. 791, 25\nL.Ed.2d 45 (1970) (\"Education has traditionally been a vital governmental function.\"); Epperson v. Arkansas, 393\nU.S. 97, 104, 89 S.Ct. 266, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968) (\"[P]ublic education in our Nation is committed to the control of\nstate and local authorities.\").\nBecause California regulates teaching pursuant to its police power, we should read Title VII as imposing liability\non such regulation only if congressional intent to do so is clear. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549,\n580-81, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (\"[E]ducation is a traditional concern of the States .... In these\ncircumstances, we have a particular duty to ensure that the federal-state balance is not destroyed. We start with\nthe assumption that the historic police powers of the States are not displaced by a federal statute unless that was\nthe clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\") (Kennedy, J., concurring; citations and quotations omitted). As\nnoted above, evidence of such an intent is far from clear. In fact, as this court recognized in Haddock, it is entirely\n\nabsent. Courts have no business imputing to Congress an intent that Title VII's specific terms reach the sort of\nregulatory activities at issue in this case.\nThe majority turns away from this necessary conclusion by taking two routes to error. First, it argues that \"[t]here\nis no overarching `licensing' exception to Title VII,\" and \"the state's high level of involvement in all areas of local\npublic schools distinguishes this case\" from the licencing cases cited above. This argument misperceives the\nissue and misapprehends applicable law. The rationale underlying the licensing cases has little to do with the\nextent of the state's involvement in the regulated activity, as the majority asserts, and everything to do with the\nprinciple that courts should not lightly infer a congressional intent to regulate in areas of peculiarly state concern. \nSee, e.g., New York State Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 82 F.Supp.2d. at 51.\nBoth the United States Supreme Court and the California Supreme Court recognize that the establishment and\ncontrol of public schools is a peculiarly governmental function. See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 580-81, 115 S.Ct. 1624; \nButt v. State, 4 Cal.4th 668, 685, 689, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d 1240, 1248, 1250 (1992). That California's\nregulation of public schools is pervasive does not convert that activity from a governmental exercise of police\npower into a proprietary activity. Rather, California's pervasive regulation of public schools is the result of the\nstate constitution's requirement that the state ensure equality of educational opportunity. See generally Butt,\nsupra. The degree of regulation that California exerts over public schools shows that it is properly performing a\n606 governmental function in light of the state *606 constitutional mandate that underlies that function.[5]\nSecond, on another erroneous path, the majority asserts that, because the CBEST applies only to public school\nemployees, in imposing the test requirement California is acting in a proprietary capacity. This assertion fails to\nsee the full picture of California's educational system. California's regulation of teacher qualifications is not\nconfined to the public school system, but extends to all teachers. Private tutors and parents intent on home\nschooling must possess valid teaching credentials. Cal. Educ.Code § 48222. Similarly, private school teachers\nmust be \"capable of teaching,\" and to permit the state to monitor that requirement private schools are required to\nfile annually with the Superintendent of Public Instruction a statement listing each of their faculty members and\ntheir qualifications. Cal. Educ.Code §§ 48222, 33190. Students who attend private schools that do not meet\nthese standards are not excused from the state's compulsory education laws that require public school\nattendance. See id.; see also Cal. Educ.Code § 48200.\nThat the state has chosen to impose different qualification requirements on teachers in different settings does not\nmean that the CBEST is an exercise of proprietary, rather than governmental, powers. Instead, it reflects the\ndiffering circumstances and differing state interests that are implicated. For example, the California Constitution\nrequires the state to \"ensure basic educational equality\" in its public schools. Butt, 4 Cal.4th at 681, 15\nCal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d at 1249. At the same time, under the United States Constitution, California may not\nrequire all children to attend those public schools, because \"[t]he fundamental theory of liberty upon which all\ngovernments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing\nthem to accept instruction from public teachers only.\" In re Shinn, 195 Cal.App.2d 683, 693, 16 Cal.Rptr. 165, 172\n(1961) (quoting Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925)). While the\nstate may have a strong interest in ensuring uniformity of basic skills among public school teachers, it does not\nhave the same interest in ensuring uniformity among private school teachers or private tutors. For this and\nperhaps other reasons, in exercising its police powers California might rationally impose different qualification\nrequirements on teachers in these vastly different settings. See, e.g., People v. Turner, 121 Cal.App.2d Supp.\n607 861, 866-67, 263 P.2d *607 685, 688 (Dep't Super.Ct.1953) (describing basis for distinction in qualification\nrequirements for private tutors, home school teachers, and teachers in private schools). Further, even if a lack of\nbasic skills were perceived to be a problem in all educational settings, it is well-established in precedents\nassessing equal protection that a state may address such problems in a piecemeal fashion. See, e.g., City of\nNew Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303-04, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976).\nB\nNot only does the majority's holding miss the clear mark set by Supreme Court precedent, it also squarely\nconflicts with the decisions of the only two other circuits to have considered a similar issue. In Fields v. Hallsville\n\nIndependent School District, 906 F.2d 1017 (5th Cir.1990), the Fifth Circuit held that a Texas teacher skills test,\n[6]\nmuch like the CBEST and applicable only to public schools,  was merely a licensing exam and not subject to\nTitle VII. Id. at 1020. The majority attempts to distinguish Fields by urging that in that case there was little\nevidence of the \"control\" over schools that is present here. The evidence that the Fields court was looking for, but\ndid not find, was evidence of, for example, whether the state \"played any role in the general hiring and firing of\nteachers\" or was involved in their \"daily supervision.\" Id. No such evidence existed there, and none exists here\neither. Hiring and firing of California's school teachers is performed by local school boards, as the majority\nconcedes. And those boards are charged by statute with controlling the daily activities that teachers perform, and\nwith evaluating their performance. See, e.g., Cal. Educ.Code §§ 35020, 44660.\nSimilarly, in EEOC v. Illinois, the Seventh Circuit rejected the theory that Sibley liability applied to render the State\nof Illinois liable for discrimination in school districts' hiring and firing of teachers, despite the pervasive control that\nthe state exerted over various aspects of the districts and their teachers, not unlike the control exerted by\nCalifornia upon which the majority's theory relies:\nThe State of Illinois exerts more control over public school teachers than over any private\nemployees in the state and probably over any other persons formally employed by local\ngovernments in the state. The state fixes not only a minimum salary for all teachers 00 which is\n97\nafter all not much different from fixing a minimum wage for private as well as public employees,\nand no one supposes that the federal government is the indirect employer of all the workers\ncovered by the federal minimum-wage law 00 but also the number of days a teacher must work,\n97\nwhat holidays he gets off, the amount of sick leave he is entitled to, his eligibility for and length of\nsabbatical leave, the minimum lunch period, the terms of teachers' tenure, the rights of recalled\nteachers, and much else besides. 105 ILCS 5/24-1 et seq. But we do not think this makes the\nstate the \"real\" employer of these teachers. So far as discrimination in hiring and firing on the\nbasis of age or other forbidden characteristics is concerned, the key powers are, naturally, those\nof hiring and firing. Those powers are in the hands of the local school district, though constrained\nof course by the tenure provision of the state's school code. 105 ILCS 5/24-12. Fields v. Hallsville\nIndependent School District, 906 F.2d 1017, 1020 (5th Cir.1990) (per curiam), holds that a state's\nrole in licensing public school teachers does not make them the state's employees. To similar\neffect, see Haddock v. Board of Dental Examiners, 777 F.2d 462, 464 (9th Cir.1985). We think the\n608 present case is closer to Fields and *608Haddock than to the cases that classify the defendant as\nan indirect employer.\n69 F.3d at 171.\nC\nThe majority's theory that a state that extensively regulates an activity is subject to Sibley liability also is\nunworkable. Where and how are we to draw a line, other than arbitrarily? States regulate a wide range of\nactivities in ways that potentially interfere with individuals' employment opportunities with third parties. For\nexample, California extensively regulates farm labor contractors, requiring them to have a state license, and\nregulating their relations both with farm laborers and the farms with whom they contract. See Cal. Labor Code §\n1682 et seq. It heavily regulates the pharmacy industry, including licensing pharmacists, and regulating their\nauthority, duties, and work hours. See Cal. Bus. & Prof.Code § 4051 et seq.; Cal. Labor Code § 850. It regulates\nschool busing, including driver certification, whom buses may carry, and the features that buses must have. See\nCal. Educ.Code § 39830 et seq. It regulates nursing and nursing education, requiring licenses for all nurses, and\nspecial licenses for public health nurses, including those employed by local, in addition to state, agencies. See\nCal. Bus. & Prof.Code §§ 675-79, 2700 et seq. It regulates harbors and navigation, including navigation, Cal.\nHarb. & Nav.Code § 240 et seq., vessels, id. § 399 et seq., masters and crews, id. § 790 et seq., and requires\nspecial licenses for pilots in the San Francisco Bay Area, id. § 1105 et seq.\nUnder the majority's theory, depending on the extent of the regulation in each of these areas, the State of\nCalifornia potentially could be liable under Title VII for the good faith exercise of its police powers to protect\n\nmigrant farm workers, the public health, the safety of school children, and the environment and safety in San\nFrancisco, San Pablo, and Suisin Bays. This result would impair federalism and is not a choice made by\nCongress.\nThe majority's opinion also calls into question this court's own decision in Haddock. The majority contends that \nHaddock is not inconsistent with its holding in Part I.A, arguing that in that case \"licensing was the entire\nconnection between the plaintiffs and the defendants.\" The State of California, however, is heavily involved in\nregulating the dental profession, including such diverse areas as setting licensing requirements, employment and\ncompensation for acupuncturists in dental offices, the use of general anesthesia, and the facilities and equipment\nthat dentists may use. See Cal. Bus. & Prof.Code § 1600 et seq. On the majority's theory, this regulation seems\nsufficient to render the State of California, if not the Board of Dental Examiners, liable under Title VII for any\ndiscriminatory impact in the dental licensing exam. Was Mr. Haddock's only problem that he sued the Board of\nDental Examiners rather than the state?\nThese are only examples but illustrate that the majority's reliance on a \"pervasive involvement\" trigger for state\nTitle VII liability either will extend Title VII into every aspect of a state's exercise of its police power, or will permit\narbitrary application of Title VII depending on each court's interpretation and assessment of the scope of state\nregulatory control in varied fields. Neither result could be what Congress had in mind when it made it unlawful for\n\"employers\" \"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment....\" 42 U.S.C. §\n2000e-2(a)(1).\nCONCLUSION\nThe majority's holding in Part I.A ignores the mandate of the Supreme Court that, absent clear evidence of a\ncongressional intent, courts must refrain from construing federal statutes as regulating in areas where states\n609 traditionally have been *609 sovereign in exercising their police powers. In addition, it conflicts with the only two\nother circuits to have considered the issue whether a state can be held liable for its school district's hiring and\nfiring actions. The holding in Part I.A also impairs respected values of federalism because the majority applies\nTitle VII to states' good faith exercise of their police powers. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from that\npart of the majority opinion.\nTASHIMA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nAmong the issues raised by plaintiffs on appeal are the procedural errors (\"procedural[] taint[]\") which \"result[ed\nin] the unreported influence of Dr. Klein.\" Plaintiffs explain their contention as follows:\nWe do not know the extent of Dr. Klein's ex parte communications with the court, nor the influence\nthese communications had with the court, nor the extent to which [his] views and unfamiliarity with\nemployment testing standards could have been tempered by the heat of cross-examination. We\nknow none of this because the district court did not require any report of the \"advice\" he received\nfrom Dr. Klein and, most importantly, denied Plaintiffs their right to cross-examine the court's\nexpert.\nAppellants' Opening Brief at 51. Because I cannot agree with the majority's cursory and mistaken treatment of the\ntechnical advisor issue in Part III, I respectfully dissent.\nI.\nCourts and jurists have long recognized that the \"law should in some way effectively use expert knowledge\nwherever it will aid in settling disputes.\" Learned Hand, Historical and Practical Considerations Regarding Expert\nTestimony, 15 Harv. L.Rev. 40 (1901). \"The only question is as to how it can do so best.\" Id. I agree with the\nmajority that the district court retains the inherent authority to appoint a technical advisor in especially complex\ncases. Maj. op. at 591. As Justice Brandeis, speaking for the Court, noted more than 80 years ago:\n\nCourts have (at least in the absence of legislation to the contrary) inherent power to provide\nthemselves with appropriate instruments required for the performance of their duties. This power\nincludes authority to appoint persons unconnected with the court to aid judges in the performance\nof specific judicial duties, as they may arise in the progress of a cause.\nEx Parte Peterson, 253 U.S. 300, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919 (1920) (approving appointment of an auditor and\nreport to be made by him). In exercising that power, however, the district court must observe certain, minimal,\nprocedural safeguards in order to insure that the advisor is unbiased and impartial, and that his participation is\nproperly confined. Here, at the district court's invitation, a question of the advisor's bias and partiality was raised,\nbut not resolved. The record is also completely devoid of any evidence of what role Dr. Klein played in the\nproceedings, the scope and basis of his influence, what materials or knowledge he may have called on in\nbringing that influence to bear, and what part his knowledge, expertise, and advice played in the district court's\nultimate finding that CBEST is a valid test under Title VII. I would therefore vacate the judgment and remand to\nthe district court for it to make findings on the bias and partiality issue, and to explain Dr. Klein's role, in\naccordance with the guidelines set forth below.\nEven though we have never held explicitly that district courts may appoint technical advisors outside the confines\n610 of Federal Rule of Evidence 706,[1] courts and commentators *610 agree that a trial court's inherent authority to\nappoint a technical advisor has not been displaced by the federal rules. See Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149,\n158 (1st Cir.1988); Notè, Improving Judicial Gatekeeping: Technical Advisors and Scientific Evidence, 110 Harv.\nL.Rev. 941, 949-50 (1997) (hereinafter \"Technical Advisors\"); cf. Hall v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 947 F.Supp.\n1387, 1392 & n. 8 (D.Or.1996) (appointing technical advisor under \"inherent authority\" of Fed.R.Evid. 104).\nAlthough the use of a technical advisor should be \"the exception and not the rule,\" expert advice can be quite\nuseful in a trial that involves unusually complex issues in fields \"beyond the regular questions of fact and law with\nwhich judges must routinely grapple.\" Reilly, 863 F.2d at 156-57. Moreover, because the district court is in a\nbetter position to decide if the appointment of a technical advisor is warranted, we should defer to its discretion\nwith respect to whether or not to appoint one. See id. (reviewing appointment of technical advisor for an abuse of\ndiscretion).\nThe majority correctly concludes that this is one of those \"rare cases\" in which the appointment of a technical\nadvisor under the inherent authority of the court is justified. Maj. op. at 590; see Reilly, 863 F.2d at 156. As the\noriginal panel opinion pointed out, this case \"involves the highly technical field of psychometrics, and presents\nproblems of unusual complexity beyond the normal questions ... with which judges routinely grapple.\" Association\nof Mexican-American Educators v. California, 195 F.3d 465, 492-93 (9th Cir.1999),reh'g en banc granted, 208\nF.3d 786 (9th Cir.2000).\nII.\nAfter three years of discovery, the district court found that it needed guidance on a host of complex, factual\nissues. As the district court noted in its order appointing technical advisor, \"the Court comes face to face with\nmany prickly problems requiring expertise in the esoteric fields of education and psychometrics including\nknowledge of theories about educational measurement and testing, cognitive psychology, statistics, and other\nfields pertaining to the CBEST and other cases.\" It then appointed Dr. Stephen P. Klein, a highly-respected test\nvalidation expert, as its \"Technical Advisor.\" Although I agree with the majority that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in deciding to appoint a technical advisor, that is only the beginning of our inquiry, and not its end, as\nthe majority seems to think.\nThe order appointing the technical advisor provides that he is to review all of the \"direct testimony of the experts\n[2]\nheretofore furnished to the Court,\"  briefs, selected pleadings, and depositions. Dr. Klein was also to be present\nin court during expert testimony, \"take such notes as he deems proper and confer ex parte with the Court from\ntime to time.\" It also noted that \"[h]is role will be similar to that of a judicial clerk and, therefore, he will not be\navailable for communication with or questioning by the parties.\" The order nowhere stated, however, what Dr.\n\nKlein was to do with all of this evidence and other information he was directed to absorb, except to \"confer ex\nparte with the Court from time to time.\"\nThe use of a technical advisor is not without risks. First, whenever a court appoints a technical advisor, there is a\ndanger that the court will rely too heavily on the expert's advice, thus compromising its role as an independent\n611 decisionmaker *611 and the requirement that its findings be based only on evidence in the record. This risk is\nespecially salient if the contents of the communications between the trial judge and the advisor is hidden from the\nparties (and appellate review), and where the parties have no opportunity to respond to the advisor's statements. \nSee Technical Advisors, 110 Harv. L.Rev. at 957. Second, experts in the relevant field, particularly if it is a narrow\nand highly-specialized one, may be aligned with one of the parties; therefore, the district court must make every\neffort to ensure the technical advisor's neutrality, lest the advisor develop into, or give the appearance of being,\nan advocate for one side. Without some safeguards, the parties' confidence in the fairness of the trial will erode.\nThus, once the district court has appointed a technical advisor, its discretion concerning the advisor's role in the\ntrial should not be unfettered. We have never had occasion to give definitive guidance to district courts on the use\n[3]\nof technical advisors and this case clearly demonstrates why we should.  Simply put, we are utterly unable, on\nthis record, to review the propriety of Dr. Klein's advice to the district court because we have no idea what role he\nplayed in the district court's factfinding process. As indicated above, the district court laid out Dr. Klein's evidence-\ngathering duties in its appointing order, but that order does not state what Dr. Klein was to do with that store of\nknowledge. There is no evidence in the record that would provide any hint about the nature, scope, or substance\nof Dr. Klein's advice. We therefore do not know whether and, if so, to what extent, Dr. Klein may have\nimpermissibly influenced the court's ultimate finding that CBEST is a valid test under Title VII: Did he draw upon\nhis own expertise and knowledge of test validation to discount or contradict the opinion of a testifying expert on\neither side? Did he explain to the court why CBEST was valid, based either on his own opinion and/or on\ninformation (such as the scientific literature in the field, including his own writings) not in the record? Or was he\nasked only to review the court's proposed findings for technical accuracy? Moreover, plaintiffs have alleged that\nDr. Klein was biased in favor of defendants and the district court did little to allay plaintiffs' concerns.\nIII.\nAlthough we need not require strict adherence to any specific procedures, I would hold that a district court\nminimally must: (1) utilize a fair and open procedure for appointing a neutral technical advisor; (2) address any\n[4]\nallegations of bias, partiality, or lack of qualification; (3) clearly define and limit the technical advisor's duties;\n(4) make clear to the technical advisor that any advice he gives to the court cannot be based on any extra-record\ninformation; and (5) make explicit, either through an expert's report or a record of ex parte communications, the\nnature and content of the technical advisor's advice. By adopting these minimal safeguards, the parties can be\nassured that the technical advisor appointment process is fair and that the technical advisor does not exercise\nundue influence on the district court. These procedures will also enable meaningful appellate review.\nA. Neutrality of the Technical Advisor\nThe district court, of course, should have wide latitude when choosing a technical advisor, who, after all, is\nretained to aid the court's understanding of the difficult and complex technical issues presented in the case. The\n612 parties, however, should be given an opportunity to object to any proposed *612 appointment based on bias,\npartiality, or lack of qualification. See Reilly, 863 F.2d at 159; Technical Advisors, 110 Harv. L.Rev. at 954-55; cf. \nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 592 & n. 10, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) (noting\nthat, with respect to proffered scientific evidence, the trial judge must determine \"the qualification of a person to\nbe a witness\") (quoting Fed. R.Evid. 104(a)). While the district court is not required to reject the appointment of a\ntechnical advisor merely because one side or the other objects, it must adequately address any concerns of bias,\npartiality, or lack of qualification that the parties raise.\nHere, the district court properly allowed both sides an opportunity to review Dr. Klein's curriculum vitae and to\n[5]\nsubmit written interrogatories to him concerning his experience and background.  Plaintiffs objected to Dr.\n\nKlein's appointment on the grounds that: (1) he had worked closely with the California Commission on Teacher\nCredentialing, one of the defendants in this case; (2) his private practice focuses on supporting certification\nexams; (3) he has taken positions on issues raised in the case; and (4) he had worked closely with one of\ndefendants' key experts, Dr. Mehrens.\nWe are unable to discern from the record whether any of these allegations are well-founded, but it is clear that\nthe district court did not adequately address these objections. After plaintiffs objected to the appointment, the\ndistrict court overruled the objection, stating that plaintiffs would have the \"opportunity to examine him fully with\nrespect to any views that he may have.\" This response to the objection might have been adequate, had the\ndistrict court actually given plaintiffs the promised opportunity. As it turned out, however, the court's response to\nplaintiffs concerns was wholly inadequate because the district court later decided that it would not have Dr. Klein\n[6]\ntestify. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the district court seriously considered plaintiffs' objections,\nor that it took any other measure to insure Dr. Klein's neutrality, such as making its own independent inquiry. This\nomission is all the more troubling because the objections, if well-founded, might well provide valid bases for\ndisqualifying Dr. Klein from serving as a neutral technical advisor.\nTo avoid this situation in the future, I would require, absent mutual agreement by the parties on an acceptable\ntechnical advisor, that the district court meaningfully address, on the record, any colorable objection to the\nappointment of a specific technical advisor. Because the district court failed adequately to address plaintiffs'\nobjections to Dr. Klein's appointment, I would remand to the district court for this determination to be made on the\nrecord.\nB. The Technical Advisor's Role\nThe role of a technical advisor also should be carefully defined and limited to reduce the risk that the advisor will\nusurp the role of the court as factfinder, see Technical Advisors, 110 Harv. L.Rev. at 955, or of even giving that\nappearance. To this end, the district court should lay out the specific duties of the technical advisor, keeping in\nmind that the advisor's role should be that of \"sounding board\" and tutor who aids the court in understanding the\n\"jargon and theory\" relevant to the technical aspects of the evidence. Reilly, 863 F.2d at 158; see Technical\nAdvisors, 110 Harv. L.Rev. at 955-56. This \"job description\" should make explicit that the technical advisor is not\n613 to contribute evidence *613 (unless called as a witness) or to be an advocate on behalf of either party. Id., 110\nHarv. L.Rev. at 955; see Reilly, 863 F.2d at 157. If the parties, the court, and the advisor all are clear on the\nadvisor's role, there will be less likelihood that the advisor will overstep his bounds or that the parties may be led\nto believe that he has. Moreover, a \"job description\" that highlights those areas in which the district court needs\naid or clarification may help to focus the parties' attention on issues that are important to the court and, therefore,\naid the parties in addressing those concerns directly. See Technical Advisors, 110 Harv. L.Rev. at 955.\nWhen the district court appointed Dr. Klein, as noted above, it ordered that he was \"to review all the direct\ntestimony of the experts, ... the parties' briefs and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and other\nsuch documents ... as seems appropriate.\" It also explained that Dr. Klein should listen to the expert testimony,\ntake notes, and confer with the court ex parte when necessary. The district court, however, failed to complete the\nlist of Dr. Klein's critical duties. It did not describe the nature or scope of its consultations with Dr. Klein, e.g.,\nwhether his role was limited to reviewing the court's proposed findings for technical accuracy, whether he was to\nevaluate the opinions of the testifying experts, or whether he was to give the court his own, independent, expert\nopinion.\nIn the future, district courts should be more specific concerning the technical advisor's precise role. For example,\nthe court could explain which technical concepts it finds troubling, and limit the expert's role to helping it\ncomprehend those technical issues. See Hall v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 947 F.Supp. at 1393-94 (listing specific\nquestions submitted to the technical advisors). The district court may even find it helpful to invite the parties to\nparticipate in defining the expert's duties to reduce the risk of perceived unfairness and to help focus the issues. \nSee Technical Advisors, 110 Harv. L.Rev. at 955.\n\nC. Making a Record\nFinally, the nature and scope of the advice provided to the district court by the technical advisor should be\nrecorded in some manner. While I would not prescribe a mandatory procedure for making that record, such as a\nreporter's transcript of all ex parte conferences between the court and the technical advisor, obviously, some\ndocumentation is required 00 such as a report by the advisor, a summary of the advice given, or the court's\n97\n[7]\nstatement on the record 00 of the court's interaction with the technical advisor.\n97\nThe district court, as well as other courts, likened the duties of a technical advisor to those of a law clerk and,\nthus, reasoned that the communications between the court and advisor may be kept confidential, i.e., concealed\nfrom the parties and the appellate court. See Reilly, 863 F.2d at 158. While there are some similarities between a\n[8]\nlaw clerk and a technical advisor, that analogy is limited.\nIn some important respects, a technical advisor is quite unlike a law clerk. A law clerk's function is to aid the judge\nin researching legal issues in cases pending before the court. Because the judge is an expert in the law and fully\n614 understands *614 legal theory and analyses, it is unlikely, to say the least, that a law clerk will impermissibly\nusurp the judicial function. On the other hand, a technical advisor is brought in precisely because the judge is not\nfamiliar with the complex, technical issues presented in the case. See id. at 157 (\"appointment of a technical\nadvisor must arise out of some cognizable judicial need for specialized skills\"). There is therefore an\nunderstandable concern that the technical advisor's opinion will carry undue weight with the judge. Cf. Daubert,\n509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (noting that \"[e]xpert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading\nbecause of the difficulty in evaluating it\") (internal quotations and citation omitted). In short, a judge can filter out\n\"bad\" legal advice or research from a law clerk; he or she is ill-equipped, however, to do the same with \"bad\"\ntechnical advice. Moreover, resolution of legal issues is committed to the judge qua judge and is subject to de\nnovo review. On the other hand, factual issues, no matter how technical, are committed to the factfinder and, to\nbe reviewed properly, must be based on the record made in the trial court.\nWhatever method the court employs in making a record of the technical advisor's advice and counsel, there is no\nreason why a neutral technical advisor's advice should be shrouded in absolute secrecy. Concealing the nature\nof that expert advice can only erode confidence in the court's role as a neutral and independent decisionmaker.\nIV.\nThese procedural safeguards are not especially burdensome and should not be difficult to apply. They are,\nhowever, essential in order to insure that the parties have confidence that the technical advisor is unbiased,\nimpartial, and qualified, and that he has not unduly influenced the proceedings. Such minimal procedural\nsafeguards are also required so that any challenge to the appointment of a technical advisor or to the degree of\nhis participation in the case can meaningfully be reviewed on appeal. Here, other than a short order appointing\nDr. Klein, the district court provided no explanation of his role. It also failed adequately to address the parties'\n[9]\nwritten objections to Dr. Klein's neutrality.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would vacate the judgment and remand this case to the district court for its resolution\n615 of these *615 issues and for such further proceedings as may thereafter be necessary.[10]\n[1] The CBEST is described in more detail in the district court's opinion. See Association of Mexican-American\nEducators v. California, 937 F.Supp. 1397 (N.D.Cal. 1996).\n[2] This appeal originally was heard by a three-judge panel of this court; the court later agreed to rehear the case\nen banc and withdrew the panel's opinion. See Association of Mexican-American Educators v. California, 195\nF.3d 465 (9th Cir.1999),withdrawn, 208 F.3d 786 (9th Cir.2000).\n\n[3] Chief Judge Hug, and Judges Schroeder, Reinhardt, Fernandez, Rymer, and Thomas join in this part of the\nmajority opinion.\n[4] Other cases following the \"interference\" model from Sibley include: Charlton v. Paramus Bd. of Educ., 25 F.3d\n194, 202 (3d Cir. 1994); Christopher v. Stouder Mem'l Hosp., 936 F.2d 870, 876-77 (6th Cir.1991); Pardazi v.\nCullman Med. Ctr., 838 F.2d 1155, 1156 (11th Cir.1988); and Shehadeh v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 595\nF.2d 711, 722 (D.C.Cir.1978).\n[5] To the same effect, see also Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exam'rs, 598 F.2d 1345 (4th Cir.1979).\n[6] Chief Judge Hug, and Judges O'Scannlain, Fernandez, Rymer, and Kleinfeld join in this part of the majority\nopinion.\n[7] In cases in which a defendant establishes that a test is validated properly, the burden shifts back to the\nplaintiff to show the existence of other selection devices that also would \"serve the employer's legitimate interest\nin efficient and trustworthy workmanship,\" but that are not discriminatory. Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 425, 95\nS.Ct. 2362 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Plaintiffs' challenge is limited to the validation of the test;\nthey do not attempt on appeal to meet their burden of demonstrating the existence of preferable selection\ndevices, assuming that the CBEST is validated.\n[8] Also relevant to our inquiry are the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (\"EEOC\") Uniform\nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (\"Guidelines\"), which are codified at 29 C.F.R. pt. 1607. Although\nthe Guidelines are not legally binding, they are \"entitled to great deference.\" Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S. at 431,\n95 S.Ct. 2362 (internal quotation marks omitted). Failure to comply with the Guidelines, although not\nautomatically fatal to an employment test, \"diminishes the probative value of the defendants' validation study.\" \nClady, 770 F.2d at 1430 (internal quotation marks omitted). The studies on which Defendants rely were content\nvalidity studies. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.5. Such studies establish whether the content of a test approximates the\nknowledge, skills, or abilities that an applicant will use on the job. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.14. \"Evidence of the\nvalidity of a test or other selection procedure by a content validity study should consist of data showing that the\ncontent of the selection procedure is representative of important aspects of performance on the job for which the\ncandidates are to be evaluated.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1607.5(B).\n[9] Our discussion of validation owes much to the original panel majority's excellent treatment of these issues.\n[10] We affirm the district court's conclusion that the CBEST was validated properly based on the second and\nthird studies: the 1985 Practitioners' Review and the 1995 Lundquist study. Because we conclude that those tests\nadequately support the district court's finding of job-relatedness, we do not discuss in detail the 1982 Wheeler\nand Elias study, on which the district court also relied. All three studies reviewed the same basic version of the\nCBEST: the version that was given between 1983 and August 1995, when the test was revised. There is no\nallegation that the test changed significantly during that period or that the test was invalid until 1985 but valid\nthereafter. Accordingly, it is sufficient for us to conclude that the test was validated properly by the 1985 and 1995\nstudies and, because we so conclude, we do not decide whether the 1982 study provides an additional source of\nvalidation.\n[11] Chief Judge Hug, and Judges Schroeder, Reinhardt, O'Scannlain, Fernandez, Rymer, Kleinfeld, Thomas,\nand Gould join in this part of the majority opinion.\n[12] Chief Judge Hug, and Judges Schroeder, Reinhardt, O'Scannlain, Fernandez, Rymer, Kleinfeld, Thomas,\nand Gould join in this part of the majority opinion.\n[13] The present case is distinguishable from those that Judge Tashima cites, see dissenting op. at 619 n. 9. In all\nbut the first and last of the cited cases, the lower tribunal failed to make findings of fact that were required by\nexisting law. The first cited case was a death-penalty habeas corpus case in which the court remanded for an\nevidentiary hearing on the merits of several claims that had been dismissed, improperly, on procedural grounds.\nThe panel's decision to remand was dictated by its application of the specific rules and procedures that govern\n\nhabeas corpus in capital cases. In the last case, the district court wholly failed to address a potentially dispositive\nlegal issue. \nBy contrast, here the district court had before it a nonhabeas civil case, in which it decided all issues presented\nand made all required findings of fact. The only question before us is whether the district court's use of a\ntechnical advisor was an abuse of discretion.\n[14] Chief Judge Hug, and Judges Schroeder, Reinhardt, Thomas, and Gould join in this part of the majority\nopinion.\n[15] Although we have not previously approved that reason for denying costs, other circuits have. See Teague v.\nBakker, 35 F.3d 978, 997 (4th Cir.1994); White & White, Inc. v. American Hosp. Supply Corp., 786 F.2d 728, 733\n(6th Cir.1986). Other reasons for denying costs that circuit courts have approved include: the \"nominal\" or partial\nnature of the prevailing party's recovery, see Richmond v. Southwire Co., 980 F.2d 518, 520 (8th Cir. 1992); \nHowell Petroleum Corp. v. Samson Resources Co., 903 F.2d 778, 783 (10th Cir. 1990); and the good faith of the\nlosing party, see Teague, 35 F.3d at 997; White, 786 F.2d at 730. The Seventh Circuit also has suggested, in\ndictum, that the denial of costs might be appropriate in cases that present \"landmark issues of national\nimportance.\" Popeil Bros. v. Schick Elec., Inc., 516 F.2d 772, 776 (7th Cir.1975); see also Delta Air Lines, Inc. v.\nColbert, 692 F.2d 489, 490 (7th Cir.1982). That dictum is similar to the district court's first reason for denying\ncosts in this case, namely, the exceptional public importance of the issues presented.\n[1]See Bernard v. Gulf Oil, 841 F.2d 547, 567 (5th Cir.1988) (remanding for specific findings because test for\ncraftsmen positions was not validated for some positions, such as welding and carpentry, even though it was\nvalidated for others, such as pipefitting and boilermaking); Walston v. County Sch. Bd., 492 F.2d 919, 926 (4th\nCir.1974) (holding, under a business necessity standard, that for the purposes of validating the use of the\nNational Teacher Examinations a \"job analysis for one teaching position (and the appropriate test for it) would not\nnecessarily be suitable for another.\"); cf. Williams v. Ford Motor Co., 187 F.3d 533, 536-37, 542 (6th Cir.1999);\n(holding content-validation study acceptable for unskilled workers at auto plant because workers were not hired\nfor specific unskilled worker positions and were rotated between positions on a regular basis).\n[2]Clady v. County of Los Angeles, cited by the majority for the proposition that we have applied the clear error\nstandard in cases involving test validation, is not to the contrary. In Clady, we applied the clear error standard\nbecause that case turned on subsidiary factual issues 00 primarily, credibility determinations of opposing\n97\nwitnesses 00 rather than the application of the Craig test to those factual findings. See Clady v. County of Los\n97\nAngeles, 770 F.2d 1421, 1431 (9th Cir.1985) (noting that the district court rejected the testimony of the appellants'\nexpert, and stating that \"[w]hen a trial judge's finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one or two\nor more witnesses, ... that finding, if not internally inconsistent, can virtually never be clear error.\" (citation\nomitted)). \nThe approach of the Fifth Circuit also does not support the majority's position. In Bernard v. Gulf Oil, 841 F.2d\n547, 567 (5th Cir.1988), the court remanded for specific findings because the district court upheld tests that were\nnot validated for some positions, such as welding and carpentry, even though they were validated for pipefitting\nand boilermaking. In doing so, the Fifth Circuit did not apply a clear error test. However, after the district court\nmade findings based on expert testimony with respect to each of the particular jobs, the Fifth Circuit employed\nthe clear error standard in reviewing the correctness of those factual findings. Bernard v. Gulf Oil, 890 F.2d 735,\n743 (5th Cir.1989). It is this second opinion that the majority cites.\n[1] Judges O'Scannlain and Kleinfeld concur in the portion of this opinion which dissents from part IV of the\nmajority opinion.\n[2] Surely any lay person sees the winner's litigation expense as a punishing exaction. That, indeed, is a common\ncomplaint about our justice system; even if you win, you lose.\n[3]National Information Services used the word \"generally,\" and while I see no real use for that loophole, perhaps\nthere is some unforeseen additional consideration. For example, some courts have indicated that actual\nindigency might be a factor. See, e.g., Contreras v. City of Chicago, 119 F.3d 1286, 1295 (7th Cir.1997); Jones v.\nContinental Corp., 789 F.2d 1225, 1233 (6th Cir.1986). While I do not see why that should be so, perhaps there is\n\nno point in cost judgments against indigents, and granting costs would just waste the resources of everyone\n(including the courts). Thus, I, too, have used that destabilizing word.\n[4] There is no evidence in the record of the exact financial condition of any of the plaintiffs. The majority opinion's\nconclusion that Plaintiffs have limited resources seems to be inferred from evidence in the record which merely\nindicates what jobs are held by the individual plaintiffs and the amount of dues the organization plaintiffs receive\nfrom their members. The district court merely found a disparity of resources between the State and the Plaintiffs.\nPresumably that disparity would almost always exist, regardless of who litigated against the State.\n[1]See, e.g., Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936)\n(Brandeis, J. concurring) (explaining the well-established principle of judicial restraint that courts should avoid\ndeclaring a statute unconstitutionally void when possible).\n[2]See Anderson v. U.S., 417 U.S. 211, 218, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 41 L.Ed.2d 20 (1974) (\"We think it inadvisable,\nhowever, to reach out ... to pass on important questions of statutory construction when, simpler, and more settled,\ngrounds are available for deciding the case at hand.\").\n[3]Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 F.3d 1104, 1113 (9th Cir.2000).\n[4]The American Heritage Dictionary 291 (2d college ed.1985).\n[5] For example, in Ahumada-Aguilar, we were unable to agree on what the Supreme Court had established as\nlaw after the Court had decided a factually analogous case, but with four opinions and no majority opinion. U.S. v.\nAhumada-Aguilar, 189 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir.1999).\n[6]Black's Law Dictionary 455 (6th ed.1990).\n[7]Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Illinois, 69 F.3d 167 (7th Cir.1995).\n[8]George v. New Jersey Bd. of Veterinary Med. Exam'ers, 794 F.2d 113 (3d Cir.1986).\n[9]Fields v. Hallsville Indep. Sch.

Salmon, Logic 21 (1963).\n[1] Judges O'Scannlain and Kleinfeld join in part II, agreeing that Title VII does not apply to the CBEST.\n[2] If Title VI or Title VII were assumed to be applicable to the CBEST, I would also agree with the majority that\nthe CBEST was properly validated.\n[3] This case arose under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). However,\nthe Supreme Court has noted that because the anti-discrimination provisions of the ADEA and Title VII are\nidentical, interpretation of one act applies with equal force to the other. See Trans World Airlines v. Thurston, 469\nU.S. 111, 121, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985); see also McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ'g Co., 513\nU.S. 352, 358, 115 S.Ct. 879, 130 L.Ed.2d 852 (1995) (\"The ADEA and Title VII share common substantive\nfeatures and also a common purpose.\").\n[4] The State of California is not an employer of public school teachers. See Fry v. Board of Educ., 17 Cal.2d 753,\n759-61, 112 P.2d 229, 234 (1941) (local school board and teacher have employer-employee relationship). Rather,\nindividual school districts employ teachers. See Gonzales v. California, 29 Cal.App.3d 585, 589-91, 105 Cal.Rptr.\n804, 807 (1972). Thus, if Title VII applies to the state, it must apply to the state indirectly, under a Sibley-like\ntheory.\n[5] That school districts are agents of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes does not transform the state\ninto an employer of all public school teachers, nor does it convert the state's regulation of education from a\ngovernmental to a proprietary function. First, the majority's assertion that school districts' Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity arises from the fact that the state is \"so entangled with the operation of California's local school\n\ndistricts,\" overstates the case. In Belanger v. Madera Unified School District, 963 F.2d 248 (9th Cir.1992), we held\nthat California's local school districts have Eleventh Amendment immunity not because of some putative\noverarching state entanglement, but because the districts satisfied the five-factor test summarized in Mitchell v.\nLos Angeles Community College District, 861 F.2d 198, 201 (9th Cir.1988): (1) a money judgment against a\ndistrict would be satisfied out of state funds; (2) the school districts perform a central governmental function; (3)\nthe school districts can sue and be sued in their own name; (4) the districts can take property in their own name;\nand (5) the districts have the corporate status of agents for school administration. \nThe fact remains, however, that the districts are distinct from the state in several respects that are relevant to the\nanalysis here. For example, although the districts may be agents of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes,\nthe state is not vicariously liable for the torts of the districts or their teachers. See Butt, 4 Cal.4th at 680-81, 15\nCal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d at 1248. Similarly, the state is not vicariously liable for a district's breach of contract. \nSee id. Finally, and most importantly, the state is not the employer of teachers, and districts have no authority to\nhire teachers on behalf of the state so as to make them state employees. See Gonzales, 29 Cal.App.3d at\n589-91, 105 Cal.Rptr. at 807.\n[6]See State v. Project Principle, Inc., 724 S.W.2d 387, 391 (Tex.1987); Tex. Educ.Code § 13.047 (1987).\n[1] I agree with the majority that Rule 706(a) has no application here because that provision only applies to\ntestifying expert witnesses, and the district court did not call Dr. Klein to testify. The shortcoming in regard to Rule\n706 was in the court's leading the parties to believe right up to the end of the trial that Dr. Klein would be called\nand then not calling him. The errors that the court did commit might well have been remedied had Dr. Klein been\ncalled as a witness and subjected to cross-examination.\n[2] As is not uncommon in bench trials, the district court required the direct testimony of expert witnesses to be\nsubmitted in written form and furnished to the court before the commencement of trial.\n[3] It is thus unfortunate that the majority gives the issue such cursory treatment.\n[4] To state conclusorily that the technical advisor's \"role will be similar to that of a judicial law clerk\" is insufficient.\nSee discussion in Part III.C, infra.\n[5] Although it struck some of plaintiffs' interrogatories and refused to require Dr. Klein to respond to others\ndesigned to probe Dr. Klein's partiality.\n[6] Interestingly, defendants also expressed some concern that Dr. Klein's writings indicated a \"strong\npredisposition for teacher assessment alternatives which are neither economically viable nor realistically feasible\nin California.\" There is also no indication that the district court addressed this concern.\n[7] In Reilly, the court suggested that a technical advisor should file an affidavit attesting to his compliance with\nthe job description after his services have been rendered. See863 F.2d at 159-60. This is one of a number of\nways that a district court could ensure that the technical advisor does not exert any inappropriate influence on the\noutcome of the trial. See also Hall v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 947 F.Supp. at 1393-94 (setting forth in detail the\ntechnical advisors' participation in the case, including the specific questions they were asked to answer); id. at\n1394 & n. 17, 1435-76 (setting forth as appendices the technical advisors' reports to the court).\n[8] I do agree that the unique role played by a technical advisor justifies ex parte communications between the\njudge and the advisor, subject to the limitations explained above.\n[9] The majority acknowledges that there is a \"relative paucity of information in the record about Dr. Klein's\ninteraction with the district court.\" Maj. op. at 591. In spite of this deficiency in the record, it is willing to \"assume\nthat the district court did its job properly when we lack evidence to the contrary.\" Id. at 591. That is not the law.\nThe law is that we require a sufficient record and findings so that we can conduct a meaningful review. When the\nrecord is incomplete through no fault of the appellant, as is the case here, we should remand to permit a record\nand findings to be made so that we are able properly to review the issue. See, e.g., Morris v. Woodford, 229 F.3d\n775, 781 (9th Cir.2000) (\"We also emphasize that a more developed factual record with regard to those claims is\nnecessary for meaningful appellate review.\") (Graber, J.); Merrill v. Apfel, 224 F.3d 1083, 1086 (9th Cir.2000)\n\n(remanding to the Commissioner of Social Security where record lacked finding on whether claimant met\ndisability requirement); United States v. Parrilla, 114 F.3d 124, 125 (9th Cir.1997) (\"because the district court ...\nmade no specific factual findings regarding the evidence of sentencing entrapment, we vacate the defendant's\nsentence and remand for further proceedings\"); United States v. Del Muro, 87 F.3d 1078, 1082 (9th Cir.1996)\n(vacating and remanding to make findings under Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D)); United States v. Robinson, 63 F.3d\n889, 891-92 (9th Cir.1995) (noting need for \"more complete and specific findings\"); United States v. Naranjo, 52\nF.3d 245, 251 (9th Cir.1995) (vacating and remanding because \"[i]n the absence of specific findings on the\nrecord, we are uncertain as to what findings the district court relied on\"); Carter v. Smith Food King, 765 F.2d 916,\n924 (9th Cir.1985) (remanding for the district court to address question \"[t]he district court did not consider\").\n[10] This remand does not, contrary to the majority's assumption, \"undo this entire trial.\" Maj. op. at 591. Whether\nthat result eventually follows depends entirely on what develops on the limited remand that I propose. If it\ndevelops on remand that the technical advisor was partial and unduly influenced the court, why would that not\namount to an abuse of discretion requiring a new trial? The majority avoids answering this question. \nI would not, at this time, reach any of the other issues tendered on appeal on which I express no opinion. The en\nbanc court should, however, retain initial jurisdiction over any further appeals after proceedings on remand have\nbeen completed in the district court to address any remaining issues.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
