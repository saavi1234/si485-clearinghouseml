    "summary": "<p>On November 1, 2000, a juvenile who had been arrested for violating curfew filed a civil rights class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of South Dakota, challenging the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center policy of strip-searching all juveniles admitted to the Detention Center, without any reasonable suspicion that the juveniles were concealing weapons or contraband. Plaintiff sought damages and injunctive relief.   The County and individual County officials denied the allegations and argued that the individual officials were entitled to qualified immunity.</p><p>On March 20, 2002, the District Court (Judge Lawrence L. Piersol) certified the case as a class action, establishing a damages class and an injunctive relief class, consisting of:  \"All persons ... who, when they were under the age of eighteen years, were charged with minor offenses at any time on or after November 1, 1997 and up to a date in the future to be set by the Court, or who were charged with non-felony offenses at any time on or after April 16, 1999 and up to a date in the future to be set by the Court, and were strip searched at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center.\"</p><p>After discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment claim.  The District Court (Judge Piersol) entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the Fourth Amendment claim and denied the individual officials' motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.  Smook v. Minnehaha County, 340 F. Supp. 2d 1037 (D.S.D. 2004).  Reconsideration was denied.  Smook v. Minnehaha County, S.D., 353 F.Supp. 2d 1059 (D.S.D. 2005), and the defendants appealed.</p><p>On appeal, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that (1) the search of the named plaintiff, requiring her to strip to her undergarments, was not a full strip search and did not violate the Fourth Amendment; (2) county officials were immune from suit even if the search was deemed illegal, because it did not vindicate a clearly established right; and (3) the plaintiff class lacked standing to seek injunctive relief.  Since the claim of the named plaintiff was dismissed, the case was remanded to the District Court to determine whether the class should be redefined or decertified and whether there was an adequate class representative to replace the named plaintiff.  Smook v. Minnehaha County, 457 F.3d 806 (8th Cir.(S.D.) Aug 09, 2006), rehearing and rehearing en banc denied (Sep 27, 2006).  Plaintiff's petition for certiorari was denied.  Smook v. Minnehaha County, S.D., 127 S.Ct. 1885 (2007).</p><p>On remand, the plaintiffs added three additional individuals as named plaintiffs for the class. In an effort to avoid having to litigate the case again, the two sides agreed to a monetary settlement. The agreement included a payment of $450,000 by the defendants, including $182,500 in attorneys' fees and $182,500 to be divided among members of the class.</p>",

The \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 1135\ncomplaint sought damages and injunctive relief.  After granting Smook's motion for \nclass certification, the district court denied the defendants' motions for summary \njudgment on the search claims, and granted the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary \njudgment on those claims.  Defendants Jim Banbury and Todd Cheever, directors of \nthe JDC, appeal the district court's denial of qualified immunity, and Minnehaha \nCounty also appeals the court's denial of its motion for summary judgment.  We \nreverse and remand. \nI. \nSmook's complaint alleged that on August 8,1999, when she was 16 years old, \nshe and three minor friends were arrested by the Sioux Falls City Police Department \nafter 11 :00 p.m. for violating local curfew laws.  All four juveniles were transported \nto the JDC.  Smook alleged that as part of the admission process at the detention \ncenter, she and each of her friends were taken into a bathroom and \"strip searched\" \nmc \nby  personnel.  (Complaint, R. Doc. No.  I, at 3-4).  In her complaint, Smook \nasserted that the institution'S search policy or practice was a violation of her right \nagainst  unreasonable  search  and  seizure  under  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments. \nThe district court certified two classes of plaintiffs who: \nwhen they [were 1u nder the age of eighteen years, were charged with \nminor offenses from November I, 1997 to a date to be set by the Court \nor were charged with non-felony offenses from April 16, 1999 to a date \nto be set by the Court, and were, pursuant to JDC policy, strip searched \nat the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. \n(R. Doc. Nos. 42, 78).  One class was defined as individuals in this category seeking \ninjunctive  relief;  the  other  encompassed  individuals  seeking  compensatory  and \npunitive damages.  The court further defined \"minor offenses\" to include petty theft, \n-2-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 3 of 16 PageID #: 1136\nliquor violations, being a runaway, and curfew violations, and defined \"non-felony \noffenses\" to include a litany of other specific non-violent offenses, such as truancy, \ntobacco, contempt of court, disturbance of school, and damage to public and private \nproperty. \nI \nAccording to the written admission policy in effect at the time of Smook's \narrest in 1999, when juveniles arrived at the IDC for admission, staff members were \nto take them to an intake area, to ask them to remove their personal items, and then to \nconduct an interview while an admission form was filled out.  A photograph was to \nbe taken, and the juvenile was to be given a wristband identification bracelet.  The \npolicy then called for the juvenile to take a shower, during which time a detention \nofficer was to conduct a visual inspection of the person's body and a manual search \nof the person's clothes, including pockets and linings.  The policy dictated that \nsearches should \"only be conducted by members of the same sex\" and that \"[t]he \njuvenile is not touched throughout this procedure.\"  (Appellees' App. at 60). \nIt is undisputed, however, that when Smook was admitted to the JDC, she was \nnot required to take a shower or to disrobe completely.  Rather, she was required to \nremove her outer clothing so that it could be searched, but she remained clothed in her \nundergarments in a private room with a female  staff member.  One female IDC \nofficial  testified  that  she  did  not  recall  ever  asking  a juvenile  to  remove  her \nundergarments,  because \"you can pretty much see what's there when they're in \nundergarments.\"  (Appellants' App. at 4).  Banbury testified to his belief that some \n'Smook's  complaint also alleged that she was asked questions about  her \nreligious beliefs and practices and \"ordered to answer those questions.\" (Complaint, \nR.  Doc. No.1, at 4).  She alleged that these questions invaded her privacy and \nimpinged upon her rights to free exercise of religion and freedom of association under \nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The district court certified two other classes \nof plaintiffs in connection with these claims, but the claims were later dismissed, and \nthey are not at issue on this appeal. \n-3-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 1137\nstaff were performing searches as described in the written policy, while others were \nnot.  (Appellees' App. at 152). \nIn September 1999, the JDC admissions policy was revised.  One revision \nprovides that when juveniles are arrested on minor charges or detained as children in \nneed of supervision, the detention officials shall attempt for two hours to contact a \nparent, and if the parent agrees to pick up the minor, then the minor may not be \nsearched or admitted to the secure area of the facility.  In addition, the JDC modified \nthe shower area by installing a screen that shields from view all but the head, neck, \nand lower leg area ofa showering youth's body.  In response to a state law passed in \n2000, which provides that \"[n  ]o person under the age of eighteen detained solely for \na curfew violation may be strip-searched,\" S.D. Codified Laws ยง 26-11-1.1, the JDC \nalso  modified its  policy to disallow strip searches of such juveniles, unless the \ndetention officer first fills out a \"probable cause\" form indicating why the search is \nwarranted. \nAfter discovery, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing \nthat strip searches of juveniles who were admitted to the facility was a reasonable \nadministrative procedure, and further asserting that even if the searches were not \nconstitutional, the defendant directors ofthe JDC were entitled to qualified immunity. \nThe plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on their Fourth Amendment \nclaim, arguing that the undisputed facts established that the policy of strip-searching \nall juveniles without individualized suspicion was a violation of clearly established \nconstitutional law . \nThe district court denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The \ncourt concluded that the JDe's written search policy in effect in August 1999 was \nunconstitutional and that the  subsequent changes to the policy did not cure the \nconstitutional defects. (Mem. Op. and Order, R. Doc. No. 116, at 11). The court also \nconcluded that the search of Smook in August 1999 violated her constitutional rights. \n-4-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 1138\n(ld. at 14).  The court further held that Banbury and Cheever were not entitled to \nqualified immunity because it was \"clearly established for several years\" prior to the \ntime of the alleged violations that the Fourth Amendment prohibited \"the kinds of \nsearches of which Plaintiff and the class complain.\"  (Id. at 15). \nThe district court then granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs on \nthe Fourth Amendment claim.  The court identified three remaining issues relating to \nthese claims:  \"(1) what type of injunctive relief is appropriate in this case; (2) what \namount of monetary damages are appropriate and how should the class members' \ndamages be determined; (3) what should the ending date be for membership in the \nfirst two classes certified by the Court.\"  (ld. at 18). \nAfter the district court entered its  order, the defendants filed  a motion to \nreconsider based on a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, N.G. \nv. Connecticut, 382 F .3d 225 (2d Cir. 2004), which was filed shortly before the district \ncourt granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.  The court in N.G. \nheld that the disrobing and visual inspection oftwo juveniles upon their admission to \na detention facility was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at 237.  The \ndefendants here argued that the N.G. decision supported the constitutionality of the \nJDC policy, and at least demonstrated that the institution's search policy did not \nviolate clearly established rights in 1999. (Defs.' Mot. for Recons., R. Doc. No. 130, \nat 11-12).  On reconsideration, however, the district court reiterated its holding that \nthe searches violated the constitutional rights of the minors, and that the law was \nclearly established prior to the searches at issue.  (Mem. Op. and Order, R. Doc. No. \n140, at 12; Add. at 12). \n-5-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 1139\nII. \nA. \nWe  begin  with  the  damages  claim  of the  named  plaintiff  and  class \nrepresentative, Jodie Smook.  The district court concluded that the search of Smook \nupon initial admission to the JDC, which required her to remove her outer clothing but \nnot  her  undergarments,  was  unreasonable  under the  Fourth  Amendment.  The \nindividual appellants, Banbury and Cheever, contend that the search was reasonable \nand, alternatively, that even if the search was unreasonable, the law was not clearly \nestablished on that point as of August 1999. \nThe Fourth Amendment proscribes \"unreasonable\" searches, and \"[t]he test of \nreasonableness ... requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against \nthe invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Bell v. Wolftsh, 441 U.S. 520, \n559 (1979).  \"A search unsupported by probable cause may be reasonable when \nspecial needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and \nprobable-cause requirement impracticable.\" Bd. ofEduc. v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 829 \n(2002)  (internal  quotations  omitted).  To  determine whether  a  \"special  needs\" \nsituation justifies a search without individualized suspicion, a court must undertake \n\"a fact-specific balancing of the intrusion ... against the promotion of legitimate \ngovernmental interests.\"  /d. at 830. \nThe most apposite precedent is the Second Circuit's recent opinion in N. G. v. \nConnecticut, where the court applied the foregoing principles to a strip search of \njuveniles upon initial admission to a detention facility.  Judge Newman's opinion for \nthe panel acknowledged that the circuits uniformly have held that adults held for \nminor offenses may not be strip searched without reasonable suspicion that they \npossess contraband.  382 F.3d at 232; see Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739,741-42 \n(8th Cir. 1985).  The Second Circuit concluded, however, that \"[s]trip searches of \nchildren pose  the  reasonableness  inquiry  in  a  context where  both the  interests \n-6-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 1140\nsupporting and opposing such searches appear to be greater than with searches of \nadults confined for minor offenses.\" N.G., 382 F.3d at 232.  The State has a greater \ninterest in conducting such a search, because \"[w   ]here the state is exercising some \nlegitimate custodial authority over children, its responsibility to act in the place of \nparents (in loco parentis) obliges it to take special care to protect those in its charge, \nand that protection must be concerned with dangers from others and self-inflicted \nharm.\"  !d.  The juvenile's interest in privacy is greater than an adult's, the court \nthought, because \"the adverse psychological effect of a strip search is likely to be \nmore severe upon a child than an adult, especially a child who has been the victim of \nsexual abuse.\" !d. \nAfter finding no prior appellate decision concerning the reasonableness of strip \nsearches of juveniles in lawful state custody, the Second Circuit tallied the State's \nlegitimate interests in performing such searches:  (1) the State has \"an enhanced \nresponsibility to take reasonable action to protect [children] from hazards resulting \nfrom the presence of contraband where children are confined\"; (2) a strip search \nserves \"the protective function of locating and removing concealed items that could \nbe used for self-mutilation or even suicide\"; and (3) a strip search may \"disclose \nevidence of abuse that occurred in the home, and awareness of such abuse can assist \njuvenile authorities in structuring an appropriate plan of care.\"  Id.  at 236.  Then \nassessing the risks to the well-being of the juveniles and institutional safety from not \nconducting the searches as compared to the risks to the psychological health of the \nchildren from performing the searches, the court held that \"strip searches upon initial \nadmission do not violate Fourth Amendment standards.\"  Id.  at 237.  A dissenting \njudge concluded that the strip searches were unconstitutional because the State had \nfailed to demonstrate a \"close and substantial relationship\" of the invasive strip \nsearches to a legitimate governmental need.  Id. at 242 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). \nSmook's constitutional claim is not as strong as that of the juveniles in N.G., \nbecause she was not subjected to a full strip search.  She was taken to a private \nrestroom by a female staff person, who explained that she would search Smook's \n-7-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 1141\nclothes for drugs, drug paraphernalia, and weapons. The staff person directed Smook \nto remove her shorts, t-shirt, and sandals, and then turned the clothes inside-out, \npulled the pockets inside-out, and looked through the sandals to ensure that they did \nnot have a false bottom.  (Appellants' App. at 30).  Smook remained attired in her \nundergarments, which she testified placed her at the same level of undress as if she \nwere \"at the beach in a swimsuit.\"  (Id. at 33).  The staff person touched Smook to \nlook under her arms, between her toes, and through her hair and scalp.  (/d.  at 30). \nAfter searching the clothing, the staff member returned the clothes to Smook and \nallowed her to get dressed.  (Id.). \nWe conclude that this search was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth \nAmendment.  The legitimate interests of the State, surveyed by the Second Circuit in \nN G., were present in this case and weigh in favor of reasonableness.  The search, \nwhile intrusive to a degree, presented a lesser invasion of privacy than a full strip \nsearch.  It has  been observed that strip  searches  requiring a  person to disrobe \ncompletely have a \"uniquely invasive and upsetting nature,\" N.G., 382 F.3d at 239 \n(Sotomayor, J.,  dissenting), and the decision of IDC  officials to  perform a  less \nintrusive  search  distinguishes  this  incident  from the  close  constitutional  issue \npresented  in  NG.  We  do  not  gainsay  that  requiring  a  minor  disrobe  to  her \nundergarments, even in a private room with only one staff member of the same sex, \nmay still be a stressful and disturbing experience.  But even the dissenting opinion in \nN. G.  did not question that a juvenile detention facility could justify \"a potentially \ninvasive search of some kind - such as a frisk search or a thorough search of all of a \ndetainee's clothing and possessions,\" id.  at 244, and there  are obvious practical \ndifficulties in conducting a thorough search ofa detainee's clothing while the detainee \nis wearing them. In light oft he State's legitimate responsibility to act in loco parentis \nwith respect to juveniles in lawful state custody, we conclude that after weighing the \nspecial needs for the search against the invasion of personal rights involved, the \nbalance tips in favor of reasonableness.  We thus conclude that Banbury and Cheever \ndid not violate Smook's constitutional rights. \n-8-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 1142\nOur decision in Doe v.  Little Rock School District, 380 F.3d 349 (8th Cir. \n2004), does not dictate a different conclusion.  In that case, our court held that a \npractice of subjecting secondary public school students to  random,  suspicionless \nsearches oftheir persons and belongings by school officials was unconstitutional. As \npart of the analysis, we observed that \"the fruits of the searches at issue here are \napparently regularly turned over to law enforcement officials and are used in criminal \nproceedings against students whose contraband is discovered.\"  /d.  at 355.  We \nconcluded that \"[r  lather than acting in loco parentis, with the goal of promoting the \nstudents' welfare, the government officials conducting the searches are in large part \nplaying a law enforcement role with the goal of ferreting out crime and collecting \nevidence to be used in prosecuting students.\"  [d. \nSmook points out that the JDC policy at issue here provides that the  law \nenforcement officer admitting ajuvenile to the facility should stay at the JDC until the \ncompletion of the search, that any contraband found on ajuvenile is to be taken by the \npolice  officer,  and that  \"it is  the  officer's  decision  regarding  further  charges.\" \n(Appellees'  App.  at  59).  Smook argues that because the searches may produce \nevidence that an officer could refer to a prosecutor in support of potential criminal \ncharges, the analysis in Doe compels a finding that the searches are unreasonable. The \nDoe decision, however, should not be read to establish that a suspicionless search \nbased on \"special needs\" is per se unconstitutional whenever the fruits ofthe searches \nmay potentially be used in criminal proceedings.  In that case, we inferred from the \navailable evidence that the officials conducting searches acted \"with the goal of \nferreting out crime and collecting evidence,\" rather than \"with the goal of promoting \nthe students' welfare.\"  380 F.3d at 355. \nWe do not draw the same inference from the evidence here.  Officers already \nare permitted to searchjuvenile arrestees for evidence as an incident oft he arrest, even \nfor a minor offense, see Atwater v. City ofL  ago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 354-55 (2001); \nid. at 364 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), and the goals of law enforcement to gather \nevidence  are thus  largely  satisfied prior to  admission  at the JDC.  We  are not \n-9-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 1143\npersuaded that the JDC's profession of concern for the welfare ofj uveniles admitted \nto the facility is merely a pretextual explanation for searches that are in large part \ndesigned to gather evidence for criminal prosecutions.  As outlined above and in the \ndecision in N. G., a residential facility like the JDC has sound reasons to act in loco \nparentis, and the incidental possibility that evidence might be discovered and referred \nto  a  criminal  prosecutor  (no  example  of which  is  disclosed  in  this  record)  is \ninsufficient to render the search of Smook unreasonable. \nBecause Minnehaha County's appeal regarding liability for the search ofS  mook \nis inextricably intertwined with the appeal of the individual defendants, see Avalos v. \nCity o/Glenwood, 382 F.3d 792,801 & n.l (8th Cir. 2004); Kincade v. City 0/ Blue \nSprings, 64 F.3d 389, 394-95 (8th Cir. 1995), we have jurisdiction to consider the \ncounty's appeal on that point.  For the reasons discussed, we likewise conclude that, \nassuming  there  was  a direct  causal  link between the search  of Smook and  the \nmunicipal policy, see City o/Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 385 (l989), the county \ndid not violate Smook's constitutional rights. \nAlternatively, assuming for the sake of argument that the district court was \ncorrect that there is no constitutional distinction between searches of juveniles in \nundergarments and searches of juveniles stripped of all clothing, and assuming the \ndistrict  court's  conclusion  that  all  such  searches  without  probable  cause  are \nunreasonable, we hold that Banbury and Cheever are entitled to qualified immunity \nfrom claims for damages arising from the search of Smook in 1999.  As ofthat year, \nthere was no appellate decision from the Supreme Court, this court, or any other \nfederal circuit ruling on the reasonableness of strip searches of juveniles in lawful \n2 \nstate custody. See N. G., 382 F.3 d at 233. Our court, like many others, had concluded \n20ne federal appellate decision in 1992 held that \"law enforcement officers may \nconduct a strip search of a juvenile in custody, even for a minor offense, based upon \nreasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  juvenile  is  concealing  weapons  or \ncontraband.\"  Justice  v.  City 0/ Peachtree, 961  F.2d  188,  193  (lith Cir.  1992) \n-10-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 11 of 16 PageID #: 1144\nthat  a  strip  search  of  adult  offenders  without  individualized  SuspICIOn  was \nunreasonable, but those cases did not consider the different interests involved when \nthe State has responsibility to act in loco parentis. \nTo  defeat  a  claim  of  qualified  immunity,  the  contours  of an  alleged \nconstitutional  right  must  be  \"sufficiently  clear that  a  reasonable  official would \nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. \n635, 640 (1987).  Qualified immunity analysis \"must be undertaken in light of the \nspecific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 \nU.S. 194,201 (2001).  Here, no governing appellate decision had decided how to \nstrike the \"reasonableness\" balance in the situation of juvenile detainees, and as late \nas 2004, the Second Circuit concluded not only that the asserted right of juvenile \ndetainees to be free from strip searches was not clearly established, but that the right \ndid not even exist.  The conclusion in N.G., at a minimum, was within the range of \nobjectively reasonable determinations that an official might have reached about the \nlawfulness of strip searches at the JDC in 1999.  Even if we have misapprehended \nhow the Supreme Court would resolve the \"reasonableness\" balance on Smook's \nclaim, we reach the alternative conclusion that Banbury and Cheever are entitled to \nqualified immunity for allegedly acting in a manner consistent with, or less intrusive \nthan, a practice that the Second Circuit later held to be reasonable and constitutional. \nIn addition to granting partial summary judgment in favor of Smook, the district \ncourt's order also granted partial summary judgment for unnamed class members who, \n(emphasis added). The Eleventh Circuit said that \"the strip search of a juvenile based \non less than probable cause 'instinctively gives us the most pause, '\" id. (quoting Bell \nv. Wolfish, 411 U.S. at 558), butthe court neither reached a holding nor uttered further \ndictum on the constitutionality of strip searching juveniles at a police station, without \nprobable cause, after an arrest for a minor offense. Uncertain dictum from a different \ncircuit on a search arising in a different context surely did not establish clearly as of \n1999 that strip searches at the Juvenile Detention Center in Minnehaha County were \nunreasonable. \n-11-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 12 of 16 PageID #: 1145\nas the class was defined by the court, were strip searched at the JDC from June 1, \n1999, through September 14,1999. Banbury and Cheever contend that they are also \nentitled to qualified immunity from suits for damages by the unnamed class members. \nTo review that contention, it appears that we would be required by the Supreme \nCourt's current direction to resolve first whether the searches of the unnamed class \nmembers violated the Fourth Amendment, and then, if so, whether the defendants are \nnonetheless entitled to qualified immunity.  See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, \n197-98 &  n.3  (2004) (per curiam); Saucier, 533 U.S. at 200; see also Bunting v. \nMellen,  541  U.S.  1019,  1024-25  (2004)  (Scalia,  J.,  dissenting  from  denial  of \ncertiorari). \nThe requirement to resolve the reasonableness of these searches of unnamed \nclass members places us in a quandary.  The specific facts underlying the claims are \nnot yet developed,  and the reasonableness of a particular search is  often highly \ncontextual.  We do not know from this record which, if any, of the unnamed class \nmembers were searched after removing all oftheir clothing, what might have led staff \nmembers at the JDC to conduct such searches (e.g., whether they simply followed a \npolicy by rote, or whether they exercised discretion based on such factors as whether \nparticular undergarments were unusually capable of concealing contraband), whether \nany  such  searches may  have  involved reasonable  suspicion, probable cause, or \nconsent, and so forth.  Plaintiffs contend that \"[t Jhe question of whether individual \nclass members were required to be completely nude or nearly nude will be determined \namong the factual matters during the damages phase of the case,\" (Appellees' Br. at \n14 n.8), yet the entitlement to qualified immunity is an immunityf rom suit, not merely \na defense to liability, Mitchellv. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985), and the individual \ndefendants are thus entitled to a decision before the litigation proceeds to that phase. \nThe posture oft he appeal is complicated further by our decision that the named \nclass representative, Smook, has no claim for damages against the defendants.  That \nconclusion typically would disqualifY her as a class representative, see, e.g., E.  Tex. \nMotor Freight Sys. Inc.  v.  Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395,403-04 (1977); Burris v. First \n-12-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 13 of 16 PageID #: 1146\nFin. Corp., 928 F .2d 797, 806 (8th Cir. 1991), but given that a class already has been \ncertified, \"the class of unnamed persons described in the certification acquire a legal \nstatus separate from the interest asserted by [Smook].\" Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, \n398 (1975). This separate legal status means that the dismissal of Smook's claim does \nnot inexorably require dismissal of the class action, id. at 399-401; Rodriguez, 431 \nU.S. at 406 n.12; but cf Great Rivers Coop. ofS outheastern Iowa v. Farmland Indus., \nInc., 120 F.3d 893, 899 (8th Cir. 1997), but it also does not mandate that we decide \nconstitutional issues in the abstract or in a context that may be hypothetical.  See \nKremens v.  Bartley, 431  U.S.  119,  134 (1977) (\"While there are  'live' disputes \nbetween unnamed members of the class certified by the District Court, on the one \nhand, and [defendants], on the other, these disputes are so unfocused as to make \ninformed resolution of them almost impossible. \"). \nUnder these unusual circumstances, we decline to pass on the merits of the \nconstitutional claims of the unnamed class members that must be resolved as a first \nstep in determining whether Banbury and Cheever are entitled to qualified immunity \nfrom suit.  Because we decline to resolve this aspect of the appeal by the individual \ndefendants, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction that portion of the county's appeal \nregarding liability for  damages to the unnamed class members.  On remand, the \ndistrict court may consider, after pausing to \"stop, look,  and listen,\" id.  at  135, \nwhether the class should be redefined or decertified, cf Gen.  Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 \nU.S. 147, 160 (1982), and whether there is an adequate class representative to replace \nSmook, if appropriate.  Cf Howe v.  Varity Corp., 896 F.2d 1107,  1111 (8th Cir. \n1990).  If the court concludes that a class should continue to be certified and there is \nan adequate class representative to continue the action, then the defendants, of course, \nmay renew motions for summary judgment if they wish.  We expect that the district \ncourt would consider any such motions in light of our conclusions regarding the \nindividual defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity from suit on Smook's claim. \n-13-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 14 of 16 PageID #: 1147\nB. \nThe  defendants  also appeal  the  district court's finding  of liability  on  the \nplaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief with respect to future searches of juveniles \ndetained for \"minor offenses.\" This appeal includes a challenge to the district court's \nconclusion that the JDC may not, consistent with the Constitution, conduct future \nsearches comparable to the search of Smook. As to that aspect of the appeal from the \ndistrict court's determinations concerning injunctive relief, we agree with the parties \nthat the issues oflaw are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the determination ofw  hether \nBanbury  and Cheever are  entitled to  qualified immunity on Smook's claim for \ndamages, such that appellate jurisdiction is proper. See Gardner v. Howard, 109 F .3d \n427, 431  (8th Cir.  1997); Kincade, 64 F.3d at 394-95.  Before we may reach the \nmerits, however, we must first satisfy ourselves that the action for injunctive relief \npresented a \"case or controversy\" over which the district court properly exercised \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Steel Co.  v.  Citizens for a Better Env't, 523  U.S.  83, 94 \n(1998). Having carefully reviewed Smook's complaint with that question in mind, we \nconclude that she and the class certified by the district court lack standing to seek \ninjunctive relief. \nThe  allegations  of the  complaint  relate  entirely  to  past  conduct  by  the \ndefendants that occurred when Smook and others were arrested for minor offenses in \nAugust 1999.  The district court's order certifying a class defined the relevant class \nas encompassing \"all persons seeking injunctive relief who, when they [were] under \nthe age of eighteen years old, were charged with minor offenses and were, pursuant \nto JDC policy strip searched ... at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center \nfrom June 1,  1999 through September 14, 1999.\"  There is no allegation about the \nlikelihood of future contact with the JDC or future unreasonable searches. \nIt is well settled that \"[p last exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show \na present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief ... if unaccompanied by any \ncontinuing, present adverse effects.\"  O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495 (1974). \n-14-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 15 of 16 PageID #: 1148\nThere is no allegation in the complaint that Smook or the certified class members are \nsuffering any \"continuing, present adverse effects\" from searches conducted between \nJune 1 and September 14, 1999.  There is no assertion that the plaintiffs expect to \ncommit additional minor offenses in Minnehaha County, or that they are likely to be \ndetained at the JDC.  And there is no allegation that ifthe plaintiffs were detained at \nthe JDC for a minor offense in the future, then they would be unable to take advantage \nof the two-hour grace period for parental pick-up, which now permits a juvenile to \navoid any kind of search when detained for a minor offense.  Even if the face of the \ncomplaint did include a general assertion of future injury, we think that attempting to \nanticipate whether any of the plaintiffs would actually be detained and strip searched \nwould take us \"into the area of speculation and conjecture.\" ld. at 497; see also City \nof Los Angeles v.  Lyons, 461  U.S. 95,  105  (1983) (\"That Lyons may have been \nillegally choked by the police on October 6, 1976, while presumably affording Lyons \nstanding to claim damages against the individual officers and perhaps against the City, \ndoes nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that he would again be stopped \nfor a traffic violation, or for any other offense, by an officer or officers who would \nillegally choke him into unconsciousness without any provocation or resistence on his \npart.\"); Hedgepeth v.  Washington Metro.  Transit Auth., 386 F.3d 1148, 1152 (D.C. \nCir. 2004) (Roberts, J.). \nAbsent a sufficient allegation that Smook and other class members are likely \nto be strip searched at the JDC  in the  future,  they are \"no more entitled to an \ninjunction than any other citizen.\" Lyons, 461 U.S. at Ill. And \"a federal court may \nnot entertain a claim by any or all citizens who no more than assert that certain \npractices of Quvenile detention officials] are unconstitutional.\"  ld.  The Supreme \nCourt has explained that this limitation on the authority ofthe federal courts does not \nmean that \"undifferentiated claims should not be taken seriously by local authorities,\" \nfor \"the interest of an alert and interested citizen is an essential element of an effective \nand fair government.\" ld.  Indeed, in this very case, the claims by Jodie Smook that \nshe was unreasonably searched at the JDC triggered a modification ofthe institution's \npolicy on searching minors, and prompted a statewide discussion that culminated in \n-15-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 149    Filed 08/14/06   Page 16 of 16 PageID #: 1149\nlegislation prohibiting strip searches, without probable cause, ofj uveniles detained for \ncurfew violations.  But a federal court \"is not the proper forum to press such claims \nunless  the  requirements  for  entry  and the  prerequisites  for  injunctive  relief are \nsatisfied.\" !d. at 112.  We therefore conclude that the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive \nrelief should be dismissed for lack of an Article III case-or-controversy. \n*  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is reversed, and the \ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n-16-",

The motion to strike will be denied. \nBACKGROUND \nThis is a class action involving allegations that Plaintiff Jodie Smook and the other class \nmembers were deprived of their constitutional rights by being strip searched and questioned about \ntheirreligious beliefs and practices, pursuant to institution policies, when admitted to the Minnehaha \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 2 of 19 PageID #: 904\nCounty Juvenile Detention Center (\"JDC\") for minor offenses in 1999. Smook asserts that she and \nthree ofh er friends were arrested by Sioux FaIls policemen for curfew violations on August 8, 1999. \nThe four teenagers were taken to the JDC where they were questioned about their religious beliefs \nand practices, individually ordered into a bathroom, and strip searched. \nThe IDC had a policy of conducting visual strip searches of all minors regardless ofthe type \nofo ffense they were arrested for or whether there was reason to believe that the minors had weapons \nor contraband.  The JDC also had a policy of questioning juvenile detainees about their religious \nbeliefs fu'1d practices. The written strip search policy in effect on August 9, 1999, when Plaintiff was \narrested, required a IDC staff person to escort the juvenile to the JDC's shower room, and instruct \nthe juvenile to remove all ofh is or her clothing, including undergarments. The JDC staffp  erson then \nconducted a thorough visual inspection of the juvenile's naked body. The juvenile was required to \ncomb through and, if necessary, lift his or her hair and to tum around.  The juvenile was required to \ntake a shower in full view of the JDC staff.  A complete search ofthe juvenile'S clothing was also \nconducted by JDe staff.  A IDC unifonn was supplied to the juvenile after showering. \nBefore Plaintiffw  as taken to the JDC an expansion project was completed to add a new non \nsecure area to the JDC.  Before the expansion project was completed, all minors were admitted to \nthe secure area of the JDC.  All minors brought to the JDC before the expansion project were \nrequired to take showers and the strip searches described above were conducte{! on all minors. After \nthe expansion project was completed all minors entered the facility through the non-secure area. \nAlthough the written policies regarding strip searches were not changed, some of the JDC officers \nmodified the strip search procedures for those minors not being admitted to the secure area of the \nIDC. \nAfter the expansion project, some of the strip searches were conducted in a unisex bathroom \nin the new, non-secure area.  A toilet, sink and shower stall were in the bathroom. The shower stall \nconsisted of a brick wall from ceiling to floor, with an open entrance to the stall.  Ifthe minor was \ngoing to be at the JDC for less than approximately 15 minutes to one-half hour, some IDC officers \n2 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 3 of 19 PageID #: 905\ndid not require that minor to disrobe.  Some JDC officers continued to search every minor that \nentered the JDC, even ifthe minor was only going to be there for five to ten minutes.  If the minor \nwas going to be in the non-secure area for over 15 minutes to one-half hour, but not going to be \ndetained at the JDC, the minor was required to disrobe and be visually searched by a same-sex JDC \nofficer.  At least some of the JDC officers allowed these minors to keep their undergarments on \nwhile the visual search ofthe minor's body was conducted.  The JDC staff would also search the \nminor's clothing before returning it to the minor.  After both the visual search of the minor's body \nand the clothing search, the minor was allowed to put on his or her clothes.  All searches in the \nunisex bathroom were conducted by one JDC officer of the same sex as the minor.  There were no \nwindows in the bathroom where the strip searches were conducted. \nIf a minor was going to be admitted to the secure area of the JDC, however, that minor was \nrequired to shower and subjected to the strip search procedure described above while showering. \nThus, those minors admitted to the JDC even after the expansion proj ect was complete were visually \nsearched while naked by a IDC officer. The majority of the strip searches of minors being admitted \nto the JDC were conducted in the secure area ofthe JDC, which was separated into a girls' and boys' \nwing.  Those separate wings contained shower areas that had multiple shower stalls separated by \nbrick walls.  The front of the shower was open to allow JDC staff to view the minors as they were \nshowering. \nOn September 14, 1999, revised written policies were issued regarding the searching of \njuveniles brought to the IDC for a minor offense, such as curfew, petty theft, or liquor violations, \nor as a CHINS child, which is an acronym for children in need of supervision.  Rather than being \nsearched soon after arrival at the JDC, these juveniles were given a two-hour grace period to allow \nJDC staffto determine whether an appropriate adult was available and willing to take custody ofthe \njuvenile before a strip search was conducted. If IDC staff could not reach the juvenile's parents or \nthe parents refused to take custody within two hours ofb eing brought to the JDC, that juvenile would \nbe subjected to the same strip search procedure as all other juveniles admitted to the JDe, which \nincluded showering and being visually searched while naked. \n3 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 4 of 19 PageID #: 906\nIn September 1999 a change was also made to the procedure for showering juveniles and \nobserving them. A screen was installed in the shower area, which allowed the JDC staff to view the \njuvenile only from the neck up and the knees down.  Consistent with the JDC' s past procedure, the \njuvenile's entire naked body continued to be observed by JDC staff before the juvenile entered the \nshower. The only exceptions for the showering requirement were if the juvenile was too intoxicated \nto shower, ifm  edical reasons prohibited showering, or ift he juvenile's behavior was such that taking \na shower would endanger the juvenile or staff. \nPlaintiff Smook was taken to the JDC on August 9, 1999, for a curfew violation, when the \nabove-described written strip search policy was in effect, but after the time when at least some ofthe \nJDC officers did not require the minors to remove their undergarments, despite the existence of the \nwritten strip search policy.  Plaintiff was one ofthose minors who was not required to remove her \nunderwear and bra during the search. She was required to remove her shirt, shorts and sandals in a \nbathroom in the presence ofa female JDC officer.  When she was wearing her underwear and bra, \nshe was visually inspected by a female JDC officer.  The officer informed Plaintiff that she was \nbeing searched for drugs, drug paraphernalia and weapons. The JDC officer also touched Plaintiff's \nhair and toes while searching those areas of Plaintiff's body. \nThe Court certified four classes in this action, distinguished upon the claims and relief \nsought.  The four certified classes are described as follows: \n1.

Motion to Strike Expert Report \nPlaintiff moved to strike Defendants' expert's report as an improper legal conclusion.  The \nreport contains some legal conclusions, but it was considered by the Court for purposes of the \nsummary judgment motion. See Johnson Group, Inc. v. Beecham, Inc., 952 F .2d 1005, 1007 (8th Cir. \n1991) (holding that although the challenged expert's testimony \"may have included inappropriate \nlegal conclusions, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the \ntestimony) (citing Hurst v. United States, 882 F.2d 306,311 (8lb Cif. 1989) (\"[a] trial court should \nexclude an expert opinion only if it is so fundamentally unsupported that it cannot help the \nfactfinder.\"ยป.  As further explained below, however, the Court rejects that portion of Dr. Kehoe's \nreport that opines that the challenged JDC policies and procedures are \"neither unconstitutional nor \nunlawful.\"  (Doc. 90.) \n5 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 6 of 19 PageID #: 908\nB.  Motions for Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment is appropriate if the moving party establishes that there is no genuine \nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter oflaw. \nFed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986).  In reviewing a \nmotion 'tor summary judgment, this Court views the evidence in a light most favorable to the non \nmoving party.  See Adickes v. s.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-59 (1970).  \"Once the motion \nfor summary judgment is made and supported, it places an affirmative burden on the non-moving \npartyto go beyond the pleadings and 'by affidavit or otherwise' designate 'specific facts showing that \nthere is a genuine issue for trial.'\"  Commercial Union Ins, Co. v. Schmidt, 967 F.2d 270, 271 (8th \nCir. 1992) (quoting Fed.RCiv.P. 56(eยป. \n1.  Strip Searches \nIn considering a strip search policy at all federal Bureau of Prison facilities, the Supreme \nCourt established a balancing test courts are to use in determining whether a search is unreasonable: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing oft he need \nfor the particular search against the invasion ofp ersonal rights that the search entails. \nCourts must consider the scope ofthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). \nIn 1985, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a district court erred in denying the \nplaintiff's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict where plaintiff had been subjected to a \nvisual strip search after his arrest on a minor offense ofv iolating a leash law. Jones v. Edwards, 770 \nF.2d 739, 741 (8th Cir. 1985).  A violation of the leash law was not \"the sort of crime to inspire \nofficers with the fear of introducing weapons or contraband into the [jail's] holding cell.\"  Id. \nPlaintiff was arrested at his home early in the morning and officers were with him at every moment \nafter they read him the arrest warrant, which included watching him dress and go to the bathroom. \nSee id.  The Eighth Circuit concluded that security could not justify the blanket deprivation of \nconstitutional rights that occurred.  See id. at 742. \n6 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 7 of 19 PageID #: 909\nIn another strip search case, the Sixth Circuit held it was clearly established in October 1986 \nthat \"a strip search of a person arrested for a traffic violation or other minor offense not nonnally \nassociated with violence and concerning whom there is no individualized reasonable suspicion that \nthe arrestee is carrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband, is unreasonable [under the \nFourth Amendment].\"  Masters v.  Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6tb Cir. 1989).  The plaintiff in \nMasters was arrested for failing to appear in court for two traffic tickets.  See id. at 1250.  She was \narrested at her home and transported to the corrections building where she was ordered to open her \nblouse and later subjected to a strip search of her entire body.  See id.  The Sixth Circuit held the \ndefendant county officers and employees were not entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff's strip \nsearch claim.  See id. at 1257. \nIn 1993, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a strip search of arrestees pursuant to \najail's blanket policy requiring all detainees, including those arrested for minor traffic offenses and \nawaiting bail, to be subject to a strip search violated the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights. \nChapman v.  Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395-97 (10th  Cir. 1993).  In Chapman, the plaintiffs were \narrested for minor traffic violations, the jail officials had no reasonable suspicion that these particular \narrestees were likely to be carrying or concealing weapons or drugs, and the plaintiffs were strip \nsearched pursuant to the jail's blanket policy that all detainees be strip searched. See id. at 395. In \naffinning the denial ofq ualified irnmunityto the sheriff, the Tenth Circuit noted that \"[e  ]very circuit \ncourt, including our own, which has considered the above circumstances under the Wolfish balancing \ntest has concluded that a search under these circumstances is unconstitutional.\"  Id. (citing cases \nfrom the Courts of Appeals in the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth \nCircuits).  The defense of qualified immunity was denied to the defendant sheriff because in light \nof several circuit court of appeals' decisions, the Tenth Circuit found that a jail official could not \nhave reasonably believed that a strip search policy applied to minor offense detainees, without \nparticularized reasonable suspicion, was lawful, even if conducted in private.  See id. at 397-98. \nIn addition to the above decisions, several other federal Courts of Appeals have declared \nunconstitutional, jailor prison policies allowing or requiring persons arrested for traffic or other \n7 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 8 of 19 PageID #: 910\nminor offenses to be strip searched in the absence of individualized reasonable suspicion that the \narrestee is carrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband.  See Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, \n802 (2d Cir. 1986) (holding that strip-body cavity search of arrestee who had been arrested for \nmisdemeanor offenses was unconstitutional where jail authorities has no reasonable suspicion that \narrestee was concealing weapons or other contraband); Steward v. Lubbock County. Texas, 767 F.2d \n153, 156-57 (5'h Cir. 1985) (strip search policy applied to minor offenders awaiting bond when no \nreasonable suspicion existed that they as a category of offenders or individually might possess \nweapons or contraband violated the Fourth Amendment); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614,615 (9'h \nCir. 1984) (strip search ofp erson arrested for minor traffic offenses held unconstitutional in absence \nofindividualized suspicion) (overruled on other grounds); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391,394-95 (10th \nCir. 1984) (held that routine strip searches in public area of persons detained for minor traffic \noffenses is unreasonable under Fourth Amendment); Mary Beth G. v.  City of Chicago, 723 F.2d \n1263,  1273  (7th  Cir.  1983) (strip search of misdemeanor offenders who were not inherently \ndangerous and who were being detained only briefly while awaiting bond violated the Fonrth \nAmendment); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F .2d 1007, 1013 (4  Cir. 1981 ) (strip search ofDWI arrestee was \n'h \nheld unconstitutional). \nThe written strip search policy in effect at the time Plaintiff was searched provided that all \njuveniles admitted to the JDC were to be searched for weapons, contraband and signs of abuse by \nrequiring the juvenile to remove all of his or her clothing, including undergarments; being visually \ninspected while naked by a IDC staff member; and being observed while taking a shower.  This \nblanket policy applied to minors arrested for minor offenses, such as curfew violations, alcohol \nviolations and to CHINS children,  as  well as to minors arrested for more serious offenses. \nMoreover, the policy required JDC staff to conduct these strip searches without regard to whether \nthe JDC staff had any reasonable individualized suspicion that the juvenile was carrying or \nconcealing a weapon or contraband. \nIn support of their argument that the strip search policy was constitutional, the Defendants \ncontend they were following nationally recognized standards recommending that all minors be strip \n8 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 9 of 19 PageID #: 911\nsearched before they are moved from the admission area to the detention area of the facility. \nDefendants cite the report prepared by their expert, Charles J. Kehoe, President ofthe American \nCorrectional Association, who opines that at the time of Plaintiff's arrest, the JDC's policies and \nprocedures were \"consistent with national standards and good juvenile detention practices and were \nnot unconstitutional or unlawful.\"  (Kehoe Report at S.) \nWhether the JDC' s strip search policy is unconstitutional or unlawful is a legal question for \nthe Court to decide. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 559 (setting forth the balancing test to be applied by courts \nin detennining the reasonableness ofa  search under the Fourth Amendment); Jones, 770 F .2d at 740-\n42  (applying the Bell balancing test).  Dr. Kehoe's conclusions that the JDC's policies and \nprocedures were \"neither unconstitutional nor unlawful\" are legal conclusions and will be rejected \nto that extent.  See Estes v. Moore, 993 F.2d 161, 163 (Sth Cir. 1993) (affirming district court's \nrejection of an expert's proposed testimony regarding the existence of probable cause for an arrest \nbecause it was a legal conclusion rather than opinion testimony). That the JDC's policies may have \ncomplied with national standards issued by a trade association or the Department ofJustice does not \ndictate that the policies were constitutional.  Rather, the Court must apply the Supreme Court's \nbalancing test applicable to alleged unconstitutional searches, which is quoted above, to determine \nwhether the strip search policy and the search ofP  laintiff violated the Fourth Amendment. See Bell, \n441 U.S. at 559. \nOne of the justifications for the existence of the JDC's strip search policy advanced by the \nDefendants is that these searches are necessary to detect abuse or neglect, so that JDC staff may \ncomply with state law in reporting such instances, pursuant to SDCL ยง 26-SA-3.  This argument is \nbased upon a faulty premise: that JDC staffhave a duty to detect abuse or neglect. The statute cited \nby Defendants in support of this  argument provides  that  any court services  officer or law \nenforcement officer \"who [has] reasonable cause to suspect that a child under the age of eighteen has \nbeen abused or neglected ... shall report that infonnation [to the proper authorities].\" SDCL ยง 26-\nSA-3.  While JDC staff must be alert to the signs of abuse or neglect ofthe minors in their care, this \nstatute does not place an affinnative duty on JDe staff to discover abuse or neglect of any minor \n9 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 10 of 19 PageID #: 912\nadmitted to the IDC.  Although IDC staff may have an interest in discovering child abuse and \nneglect, the Defendants have not cited and the Court has not found any authority holding that this \ninterest justifies the invasion ofthe minor's personal rights involved in a strip search. Balancing the \nJDe's interest in discovering child abuse and neglect against the invasion ofthe minors' personal \nrights entailed in a strip search leads this Court to the conclusion that the strip search policy in this \ncase violates the minors' Fourth Amendment rights. \nAnother argument advanced by the Defendants in support of the constitutionality of the \nJDe's strip searches is that the searches of juveniles were reasonable administrative searches \nundertaken to satisfy an important government regulatory interest. The Defendants argue that \"strip \nsearches  can be conducted on less  than  probable  cause or reasonable suspicion where the \ngovernment's legitimate security interest outweighs an inmate's privacy interest.\"  (Defendants' \nBrief in Reply to Plaintiffs' Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. 107.) \nAs explained below, however, the Court does not fmd in this case that the JDe's legitimate security \ninterest outweighs the minors' privacy interests. \nDefendants contend the strip search policy is justified by the JDC's security interest in \nprotecting those in its care, in addition to protecting the IDe staff.  The Defendants attempt to \ndistinguish the unconstitutional search in Jones, 770 F.2d at 742, from the present case. In that case, \nthe Eighth Circuit held that: \"[a] lthough we recognize that the security of detention facilities is an \nimportant concern of correction officials who are, in part, responsible for the safety of their charges, \nwe also recognize that security cannot justify the blanket deprivation of rights of the kind incurred \nhere.\"  Jones, 770 F.2d at 742.  The Court recognizes that the JDC has a security interest in \npreventing the introduction of weapons or contraband into its facility.  The evidence in this record, \nhowever, does not demonstrate that the incidence of smuggling weapons or contraband into the IDC \nis more than minimal.  See Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (the evidence before the Court showed that the \nincidence of smuggling activity at the jail was minimal). \n10 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 11 of 19 PageID #: 913\nThe JDC' s security interest must be balanced against the invasion ofp ersonal rights entailed \nin a strip search conducted pursuant to its written policies. The invasion of personal rights entailed \nin a strip search conducted pursuant to its written policies is similar to the invasion involved in the \ncourts 0 f appeals' decisions discussed above. As recognized by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals \n\"[t]he experience of disrobing and exposing one's self for visual inspection by a stranger clothed \nwith the uniform and authority of the state, in an enclosed room inside a jail, can only be seen as \nthoroughly degrading and frightening. Moreover, the imposition ofs uch a search upon an individual \ndetained for a lesser offense is quite likely to take that person by surprise, thereby exacerbating the \nterrifying quality of the event.\" Chapman, 989 F.2d at 396 (citations omitted).  In this case, minors \nare required to completely disrobe in front of a same-sex IDC official and are visually inspected by \na IDC official before they take a shower, in the absence of any suspicion that they are carrying or \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  As the Tenth Circuit held \"[t]here can be no doubt that \na strip search is an invasion of personal rights of the first magnitude.\"  Chapman, 989 F.2d at 395. \nInterestingly, Defendants have not cited a case in which the security interest ofa  correctional facility \nhas outweighed the personal rights of a person arrested for a minor offense, who was subjected to \na strip search in the absence of any individualized suspicion that the arrestee was carrying or \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband. \nSimilar to the Giles court, balancing the JDC's security interest against the privacy interests \nofthe class members, the Court holds that minors charged with minor or non-felony offenses may \nbe subjected to a strip search only ifJDC officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the individual \nminor is carrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband.  See Giles, 746 F.2d at 617. \nReasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the minor's \nappearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.  See id. \nThe  change  to  the  strip  search  policy  made  in  September  1999  did  not  cure  the \nunconstitutionality of the policy. Rather, the two-hour grace period likely spared some minors from \nbeing strip searched in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The minors who were not picked up \n11 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 12 of 19 PageID #: 914\nwithin two hours were subjected to the same unconstitutional search as those minors strip searched \nbefore the September 1999 policy change. \nIn addition to the two-hour grace period, Defendants emphasize that there was a screen \ninstalled in the shower to shield the minors' naked bodies from their necks down and their ankles \nup.  The record is unclear whether this screen was installed only in the one shower in the unisex \nbathroom located in the non-secure area of the JDC, or whether there were screens also installed in \nthe multiple showers in the girls' wing in the secure area of the JDC. In any event, a shower screen \ndid not cure the unconstitutionality of the strip searches, because IDC staff visually searched all \nminors required to shower before entering the shower. \nNow that the Court has held the JOe's written strip search policy is unconstitutional, the Court \nturns to the specific search of the Plaintiff in this action. Defendants seek to minimize the intrusion of \nthe class members' personal rights by pointing out that Plaintiff was not required to shower or remove \nher underwear and bra during the search of her body and clothing. Defendants state in their brief that \n\"[j]uveniles were asked to remove only their outer clothing, not their undergarments, (Devlin Dep. at \n13), a policy more lenient than recommended by national standards.\" (Defendants' Brief in Support \nof Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. 87.) The record does demonstrate that some minors were not \nrequired to shower or remove their undergarments during their searches. \n\\Vhen asked whether minors were asked to remove their undergarments during the clothing \nsearch, one IDC official, Bridget Devlin, responded \"I never - I don't recall asking anyone to do that. \nI mean, you can pretty much see what's there when they're in undergarments so -.\" (Devlin Dep. at \n15.) Later in her deposition, Dev lin does state that she did not require minors to remove their bras and \nunderwear (Devlin Dep. at 31), and that if a minor was having issues with or was a little embarrassed \nby undressing in front of someone else she tried to afford them the right of dressing in the shower area. \n(Devlin Dep. at 39.) Jim Banbury, the Director of the JDC in 1999 testified, however, that during the \ntime from when the expansion project was completed to the issuance ofthe revised written policies on \nSeptember 14, 1999, JDC officers were inconsistently applying the JDC's written search policies that \napplied before the non-secure area was completed.  (Banbury Dep. at 38-39, 53-54.)  Some JDC \n12 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 13 of 19 PageID #: 915\nofficers were fully complying with the written strip search policy held unconstitutional above and others \nwere modifying the searches to not require removal ofundergannents. (ld.) Despite the inconsistencies \nin applying lhe written search policies to those minors not admitted to the secure area of IDC, all of the \nclass members required to take showers, whether housed in the secure or non-secure area, were visually \nsearched wbile naked. And those minors subject to clothing searches, but were not required to shower, \nwere required to at least remove all clothing except their undergarments and were subjected to a visual \nsearch of their bodies while wearing only their undergarments. \nThat the JDC official who searched Plaintiffd id not require her to remove her underwear and \nbra in addition to her other clothing does not result in a different outcome from the holding above \nthat the JDC's written strip search policy is unconstitutional.  The Court described in detail above \nthe written strip search policy in effect at the time Plaintiff was brought to the JDC on August 9, \n1999,  alld  the  modifications  to  the  policy on September  14,  1999,  and  the  reasons  it  is \nunconstitutional.  Although some JDC officials were not complying with the written procedure \nrequiring all minors to completely disrobe and shower, the Court is unwilling to draw the line \nbetween constitutional and unconstitutional searches at whether the person being searched is \ncompletely nude or nearly nude. Defendants do not cite and the Court has not found a case drawing \nsuch a distinction. Rather, the Eleventh Circuit described a visual search of a female juvenile who \nwas required to remove all of her outer clothing and her bra, but was allowed to keep her underwear \non, as a \"strip search,\" and did not draw a distinction between a search while wearing one's \nundergarments as less invasive than a search while completely nude. See Justice v. City a/Peachtree \nCity, 961 F.2d 188, 190-91 (11  Cir. 1992). \nth \nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals applied the Supreme Court's balancing test set forth \nin Bell to determine whether the strip search of the minor plaintiff violated her Fourth Amendment \nrights.  See id. at 191-94.  Despite the fact that the minor was allowed to keep her underwear on \nduring the search, the Eleventh Circuit recognized that H[c]hildren are especially susceptible to \npossible traumas from strip searches .... [YJouth is more than a chronological fact.  It is a time and \ncondition oflife when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.\" \n13 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 14 of 19 PageID #: 916\n[d. at 192 (citations and quotation marks omitted).  The strip search in Justice of a female juvenile \nrequired to remove all clothing except her underwear was found constitutional only because the \nDefendants had reasonable suspicion to believe the juvenile was carrying or concealing contraband. \nSee id. at 194. In the present case Plaintiff's nearly naked body was visually searched for weapons \nand contraband, when she was arrested for a curfew violation, without any suspicion that Plaintiff \nwas carrying or concealing such items. \nApplying the balancing test to the search ofthe Plaintiff, the Court concludes that the search \nviolated her Fourth Amendment rights. Plaintiffwas arrested for a minor offense, a curfew violation. \nLike the offenses for which the plaintiffs in several courts of appeals regarding strip searches, a \ncurfew violation is not normally associated with weapons, violence or drugs.  See, e.g., Chapman, \n989 F.2d at 395-97 (minor traffic violations); Masters, 872 F.2d at 1255 (minor traffic offense); \nGiles, 746 F.2d at 618 (recognizing that the plaintiff's traffic violation was related neither to drugs \nnor to weapons); Jones, 770 F.2d at (leash law violation); Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (driving while \nintoxicated). JDC officials had no suspicion that she was carrying or concealing a weapon or other \ncontraband. There is no indication that Plaintiff had a prior delinquency record. There is evidence \nthat Plaintiff was emotionally upset and crying whi Ie she was at the JDC, but there is no evidence \nthat she was anything but cooperative and orderly.  Weighing the intrusiveness of the strip search, \neven taking into account that Plaintiffwas not required to remove her bra and underwear, against the \nminimal showing of need to conduct the indiscriminate search, the Court concludes that the search \nof Plaintiff on August 9, 1999, violated her Fourth Amendment rights. \nDefendants contend that Defendant Banbury, former Director of the JDC, and Defendant \nTodd Cheever, current Director of the IDC, are entitled to qualified immunity from the Plaintiff's \nand the other class members' claims for monetary damages. Jail officials are \"protected by qualified \nimmunity so long as 'their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they \nare alleged to have violated.'\"  Gregoire v.  Class, 236 F.3d 413,417 (8'h Cir. 2000) (quoting \nAnderson v.  Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987ยป.  \"To overcome this qualified immunity, the \nplaintiff must 'assert a violation of a constitutional or statutory right; that right must have been \n14 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 15 of 19 PageID #: 917\nclearly established at the time of the violation; and, given the facts most favorable to the plaintiff, \nthere must be no genuine issues of material fact as to whether a reasonable official would have \nknown that the alleged action indeed violated that right.'\"  Id. (quoting Liebe v. Norton, 157 F.3d \n574,577 (8th Cir. 1998)). \nThe lack of a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of strip searching juveniles in a \ndetention facility, does not preclude a finding that the law was clearly established that the search of \nthe Plaintiff and the other class members violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  The Eighth \nCircuit has recognized that in determining whether a right is clearly established for purpose ofthe \nqualified immunity defense: \n\"[I]t is not necessary that the Supreme Court has directly addressed the issue, nor \ndoes the precise action or omission in question need to have been held unlawfuL In \nthe absence ofb inding precedent, a court should look to all available decisional law \nincluding decisions of state courts, other circuits and district courts .... \" \nBurnham v. lanni, 119 F.3d 668, 677 (8th Cir. I 997)(quoting Hayes v. Long, 72 F.3d 70, 73 (8th Cir. \n1995) (citation omittedยป. \nIt is asserted in this action that Defendants Banbury and Cheever violated Plaintiff's and the \nother class members' Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. By the time \nof the violations involved in this action, it had been clearly established for several years that the \nFourth Amendment protected persons from the kinds of searches of which Plaintiff and the class \ncomplain.  See Jones, 770 F.2d at 742 n.4 (denying qualified immunity to jail officials who \nconducted a strip search in 1981 on a person arrested for minor offenses without any suspicion that \nhe was harboring weapons or contraband and holding that \"the fourth amendment's protection \nagainst the kind of search ofw  hich Jones complains was well-established at the time his search took \nplace.\").  In addition to the Eighth Circuit, the Court cited above seven other federal courts of \nappeals that have mled strip searching arrestees of minor offenses without at least reasonable \nsuspicion that the arrestee is carrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband violates the \narrestees' Fourth Amendment rights.  Those courts applied the Supreme Court's balancing test set \nforth in Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, in reaching their conclusions, as the Court has done in this case. \n15 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 16 of 19 PageID #: 918\nDefendants Banbury and Cheever argue that because their actions complied with national \nstandards for good practice in the operation of juvenile correctional facilities, they are entitled to \nqualified immunity.  It is noted that it has not been established on the record in this case that \nDefendants Banbury and Cheever were aware of the nationally recognized standards cited by \nDefendants' expert.  In any event, even if they were aware of those standards, they are not entitled \nto the protection of qualified immunity because such standards do not override clearly established \nlaw. Based upon the established case law from the Eighth Circuit, as well as the seven other Circuit \nCourts of Appeals to have ruled on the unconstitutionality of strip searching persons arrested for \nminor offenses without any reasonable individualized suspicion ofc arrying or concealing contraband \nor weapons, the Court finds that there is no genuine issues ofm  aterial fact as to whether a reasonable \nofficial would have known that the strip searches involved in this action indeed violated the class \nmembers' Fourth Amendment rights.  Thus, Defendants Banbury and Cheever are not entitled to \nqualified immunity on Plaintiff's and the other class members' claims for monetary damages. \n2.  Religious Preference Questioning \nDefendants seek summary judgment on the claims of the third and fourth classes certified \nby the Court regarding the IDC's policy and procedure in questioning minors being admitted to the \nJDC about their religious preferences.  If a minor refused to answer the questions about their \nreligious preferences, he or she was not forced to answer the questions and was not punished for \nrefusing to answer. The minors that did answer the questions were not treated more or less favorably \nthan any other detainees. \nDefendants contend that the religious preference questions were asked to help JDC staff \nensure that any required dietary restrictions or observances were met.  Defendants argue that there \nwas no infringement of the class members' rights to privacy or free exercise of religion as a result \nof the challenged questions. \nIn response to Defendants' motion, class counsel concedes \"[s]ince the constitutional \nviolation in this regard would result in only nominal damages and the defendants have discontinued \n16 \n-----------------\n~---~--- ~---~~~--. ~-~~-------------\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 17 of 19 PageID #: 919\nthe practice, plaintiffs are seeking only declaratory relief under Count II.\" (plaintiffs' Response to \nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. 104.) As a result of this abandonment of a claim \nfor monetary damages, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all claims asserted by the \nfourth class certified by the Court seeking monetary damages for the Defendants' practice of \nquestioning minors about their religious beliefs. \nIn light oft he Defendants' discontinuance ofq uestioning minors about their religious beliefs \nand the abandonment of any claim for damages on that claim, the Court must examine whether a live \ncase or controversy continues to exist.  \"Article ill of the Constitution only allows federal courts to \nadjudicate actual, ongoing cases or controversies.\" Potter v. Norwest Mortgage, Inc., 329 F.3d 608, \n611 (8th Cir. 2003).  \"When an action no longer satisfies the case or controversy requirement, the \naction is moot and a federal court must dismiss the action.\" Id. (citing Minn. Humane Soc yv. Clark, \n184 F.3d 795, 797 (8th Cir. 1999). The Supreme Court explained: \nIt has long been settled that a federal court has no authority \"to give opinions upon \nmoot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules oflaw which \ncannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it.\" .... For that reason, if an event \noccurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to \ngrant \"any effectual relief whatever\" to a prevailing party, the appeal must be \ndismissed. \nChurch ofS cientology ofC  alifornia v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992) (citations omitted). In \nthis case, the Defendants discontinued the practice of asking minors admitted to the JDC about their \nreligious beliefs.  There is no evidence in the record to suggest that the Defendants intend to \nreestablish this practice. Even ifthe Court were to find the practice violated Plaintiff's and the other \nclass members' constitutional rights, the withdrawal of the claim for monetary damages makes it \nimpossible for the Court to grant \"any effectual relief whatever\" to the class.  Id.  Declaratory relief \non the religious questioning practice as requested by Plaintiff \"cannot affect the matter in issue in \nthe case\" before the Court. Thus, the Court finds the claims of the third class certified by the Court \nmust be dismissed without pr~udice as moot. \n17 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 18 of 19 PageID #: 920\nCONCLUSION \nThe Court will deny Plaintiff's Motion to Strike, Doc. 101, but the Court rejects that portion \nof Dr.  Kehoe's report  where  he opines  that  the  IDC's policies  and  practices  are \"neither \nunconstitutional nor unlawful.\"  It is for the Court to detennine whether the JDe's policies and \npractices are unconstitutional or unlawful. For the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that \nthe IDC's blanket policy of strip searching minors arrested for minor or non-felony offenses, without \nany individualized detennination of reasonable suspicion that the individual was or is likely to be \ncarrying or concealing weapons, drugs or other contraband, violates the Fourth Amendment. \nFurthennore, the strip search of the Plaintiff, Jodie Smook, violated her Fourth Amendment rights. \nThe members of the first two classes certified by the Court, therefore, are entitled to summary \njudgment on their claims that the strip searches they endured at the IDC pursuant to the IDC's \nblanket strip search policy violated their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable \nsearches.  The remaining issues relating to the strip search claims are: 1) what type of injunctive \nrelief is appropriate in this case; 2) what amount of monetary damages are appropriate and how \nshould the class members'  damages be detennined;  3) what should the ending date be for \nmembership in the first two classes certified by the Court. \nThe claims asserted by the third class certified by the Court, the class seeking injunctive relief \nfor being questioned about their religious beliefs, will be dismissed without prejudice as moot. \nSummary judgment will be entered in favor ofthe Defendants, and against the fourth class certified \nby the Court, because the class has abandoned the damages claim for being subjected to questioning \nabout their religious beliefs at the JDC.  Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED: \n1.  That Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Expert Report, Doc. 101, is denied. \n2.  That Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Doc. 91, is granted. \n3.  That Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. 86, is (a) granted to \nthe extent that the claims by the third class, seeking injunctive reliefbased on \nreligious questioning, are dismissed without prejudice as moot; (b) granted \n18 \n----\n------\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 116    Filed 09/27/04   Page 19 of 19 PageID #: 921\nas to the claims by the fourth class, seeking damages based on religious \nquestioning; and (c) denied as to the strip search claims asserted by the first \nand second classes. \n4.  That at the close of the case, judgment will be entered in favor ofD  efendants \non the claims of the following classes: \nAil persons seeking injunctive relief in this action who, when they under the \nage of eighteen years, were charged with minor offenses from November 1, \n1997 to September 14, 1999, or were charged with non-felony offenses from \nApril 16, 1999 to September 14, 1999, and were, pursuant to JDC policy, \nsubjected to questioning about their religious beliefs at the Minnehaha \nCounty Juvenile Detention Center. \nAll persons seeking compensatory and punitive damages in this action who, \nwhen they under the age ofe ighteen years, were charged with minor offenses \nfrom November 1, 1997 to September 14, 1999 or were charged with non \nfelony offenses from April  16,  1999 to September 14,  1999, and were, \npursuant to JDC policy, subjected to questioning about their religious beliefs \nat the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. \n5.

The \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 1168\ncomplaint sought damages and injunctive relief.  After granting Smook's motion for \nclass certification, the district court denied the defendants'  motions for summary \njudgment on the search claims, and granted the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary \njudgment on those claims.  Defendants Jim Banbury and Todd Cheever, directors of \nthe JDC, appeal the district court's denial of qualified immunity, and Minnehaha \nCounty also appeals the court's denial of its motion for summary judgment.  We \nreverse and remand. \n1. \nSmook's complaint alleged that on August 8, 1999, when she was 16 years old, \nshe and three minor friends were arrested by the Sioux Falls City Police Department \nafter 11 :00 p.m. for violating local curfew laws.  All four juveniles were transported \nto the JDC.  Smook alleged that as part of the admission process at the detention \ncenter, she and each of her friends were taken into a bathroom and \"strip searched\" \nby mc personnel.  (Complaint, R. Doc. No.1, at 3-4).  In her complaint, Smook \nasserted that the institution's search policy or practice was a violation of her right \nagainst  unreasonable  search  and  seizure  under  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments. \nThe district court certified two classes of plaintiffs who: \nwhen they [were] under the age of eighteen years, were charged with \nminor offenses from November 1, 1997 to a date to be set by the Court \nor were charged with non-felony offenses from April 16, 1999 to a date \nto be set by the Court, and were, pursuant to JDC policy, strip searched \nat the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. \n(R. Doc. Nos. 42, 78).  One class was defined as individuals in this category seeking \ninjunctive  relief;  the  other  encompassed  individuals  seeking  compensatory  and \npunitive damages.  The court further defined \"minor offenses\" to include petty theft, \n-2-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 3 of 16 PageID #: 1169\nliquor violations, being a runaway, and curfew violations, and defined \"non-felony \noffenses\" to include a litany of other specific non-violent offenses, such as truancy, \ntobacco, contempt of court, disturbance of school, and damage to public and private \nproperty. I \nAccording to the written admission policy in effect at the time of Smook's \narrest in 1999, whenjuveniles arrived at the IDC for admission, staff members were \nto take them to an intake area, to ask them to remove their personal items, and then to \nconduct an interview while an admission form was filled out.  A photograph was to \nbe taken, and the juvenile was to be given a wristband identification bracelet.  The \npolicy then called for the juvenile to take a shower, during which time a detention \nofficer was to conduct a visual inspection of the person's body and a manual search \nof the person's clothes, including pockets and  linings.  The policy dictated that \nsearches should \"only be conducted by members of the same sex\" and that \"[t]he \njuvenile is not touched throughout this procedure.\"  (Appellees' App. at 60). \nIt is undisputed, however, that when Smook was admitted to the IDC, she was \nnot required to take a shower or to disrobe completely.  Rather, she was required to \nremove her outer clothing so that it could be searched, but she remained clothed in her \nundergarments in  a private room with a female staff member.  One female IDC \nofficial  testified  that  she  did  not  recall  ever  asking  a juvenile  to  remove  her \nundergarments, because \"you can pretty much see what's there when they're in \nundergarments.\"  (Appellants' App. at 4).  Banbury testified to his belief that some \nISmook's complaint also  alleged  that  she  was  asked questions  about her \nreligious beliefs and practices and \"ordered to answer those questions.\" (Complaint, \nR.  Doc. No.1, at 4).  She alleged that these questions invaded her privacy and \nimpinged upon her rights to free exercise ofr eligion and freedom ofa ssociation under \nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The district court certified two other classes \nofp laintiffs in connection with these claims, but the claims were later dismissed, and \nthey are not at issue on this appeal. \n-3-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 1170\nstaff were performing searches as described in the written policy, while others were \nnot.  (Appellees' App. at 152). \nIn September 1999, the JDC admissions policy was revised.  One revision \nprovides that when juveniles are arrested on minor charges or detained as children in \nneed of supervision, the detention officials shall attempt for two hours to contact a \nparent, and if the parent agrees to pick up the minor, then the minor may not be \nsearched or admitted to the secure area of the facility.  In addition, the JDC modified \nthe shower area by installing a screen that shields from view all but the head, neck, \nand lower leg area of a showering youth's body.  In response to a state law passed in \n2000, which provides that \"[n  ]o person under the age of eighteen detained solely for \na curfew violation may be strip-searched,\" S.D. Codified Laws ยง 26-11-1.1, the JDC \nalso modified its  policy to  disallow strip searches of such juveniles, unless the \ndetention officer first fills out a \"probable cause\" form indicating why the search is \nwarranted. \nAfter discovery, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing \nthat strip searches of juveniles who were admitted to the facility was a reasonable \nadministrative procedure, and further asserting that even if the searches were not \nconstitutional, the defendant directors ofthe JDC were entitled to qualified immunity. \nThe plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on their Fourth Amendment \nclaim, arguing that the undisputed facts established that the policy of strip-searching \nall juveniles without individualized suspicion was a violation of clearly established \nconstitutional law . \nThe district court denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The \ncourt concluded that the JDC's written search policy in effect in August 1999 was \nunconstitutional and that the subsequent changes to the policy did not cure the \nconstitutional defects. (Mem. Op. and Order, R. Doc. No. 116, at 11). The court also \nconcluded that the search of Smook in August 1999 violated her constitutional rights. \n-4-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 1171\n(ld. at 14).  The court further held that Banbury and Cheever were not entitled to \nqualified immunity because it was \"clearly established for several years\" prior to the \ntime of the alleged violations that the Fourth Amendment prohibited \"the kinds of \nsearches of which Plaintiff and the class complain.\"  (ld at 15). \nThe district court then granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs on \nthe Fourth Amendment claim.  The court identified three remaining issues relating to \nthese claims:  \"(1) what type of injunctive relief is appropriate in this case; (2) what \namount of monetary damages are appropriate and how should the class members' \ndamages be determined; (3) what should the ending date be for membership in the \nfirst two classes certified by the Court.\"  (Jd. at 18). \nAfter the district court entered its order,  the defendants  filed a motion  to \nreconsider based on a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, NG. \nv. Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225 (2d Cir. 2004), which was filed shortly before the district \ncourt granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.  The court in N G. \nheld that the disrobing and visual inspection of two juveniles upon their admission to \na detention facility was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Id at 237.  The \ndefendants here argued that the NG. decision supported the constitutionality of the \nIDC policy, and at least demonstrated that the institution's search policy did not \nviolate clearly established rights in 1999. (Defs.' Mot. for Recons., R. Doc. No. 130, \nat 11-12).  On reconsideration, however, the district court reiterated its holding that \nthe searches violated the constitutional rights of the minors, and that the law was \nclearly established prior to the searches at issue.  (Mem. Op. and Order, R. Doc. No. \n140, at 12; Add. at 12). \n-5-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 1172\nII. \nA. \nWe  begin  with  the  damages  claim  of  the  named  plaintiff  and  class \nrepresentative, Jodie Smook.  The district court concluded that the search of Smook \nupon initial admission to the JDC, which required her to remove her outer clothing but \nnot her  undergarments,  was  unreasonable  under  the  Fourth  Amendment.  The \nindividual appellants, Banbury and Cheever, contend that the search was reasonable \nand, alternatively, that even if the search was unreasonable, the law was not clearly \nestablished on that point as of August 1999. \nThe Fourth Amendment proscribes \"unreasonable\" searches, and \"[t]he test of \nreasonableness ... requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against \nthe invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, \n559 (1979).  \"A search unsupported by probable cause may be reasonable when \nspecial needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and \nprobable-cause requirement impracticable.\" Bd. ofE  duc. v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 829 \n(2002)  (internal  quotations  omitted).  To determine whether a  \"special needs\" \nsituation justifies a search without individualized suspicion, a court must undertake \n\"a fact-specific balancing of the intrusion ... against the promotion of legitimate \ngovernmental interests.\"  [d. at 830. \nThe most apposite precedent is the Second Circuit's recent opinion in N.G. v. \nConnecticut, where the court applied the foregoing principles to a strip search of \njuveniles upon initial admission to a detention facility.  Judge Newman's opinion for \nthe panel acknowledged that the circuits uniformly have held that adults held for \nminor offenses may not be strip searched without reasonable suspicion that they \npossess contraband.  382 F.3d at 232; see Jones v.  Edwards, 770 F.2d 739,741-42 \n(8th Cir. 1985).  The Second Circuit concluded, however, that \"[s]trip searches of \nchildren pose the  reasonableness  inquiry  in  a  context where both  the  interests \n-6-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 1173\nsupporting and opposing such searches appear to be greater than with searches of \nadults confined for minor offenses.\" NG., 382 F.3d at 232.  The State has a greater \ninterest in conducting such a search, because \"[ w ]here the state is exercising some \nlegitimate custodial authority over children, its responsibility to act in the place of \nparents (in loco parentis) obliges it to take special care to protect those in its charge, \nand that protection must be concerned with dangers from others and self-inflicted \nharm.\"  Id.  The juvenile's interest in privacy is greater than an adult's, the court \nthought, because \"the adverse psychological effect of a strip search is likely to be \nmore severe upon a child than an adult, especially a child who has been the victim of \nsexual abuse.\"  Id. \nAfter finding no prior appellate decision concerning the reasonableness of strip \nsearches of juveniles in lawful state custody, the Second Circuit tallied the State's \nlegitimate interests in performing such searches:  (1) the State has \"an enhanced \nresponsibility to take reasonable action to protect [children] from hazards resulting \nfrom the presence of contraband where children are confined\"; (2) a strip search \nserves \"the protective function of locating and removing concealed items that could \nbe used for self-mutilation or even suicide\"; and (3) a strip search may \"disclose \nevidence of abuse that occurred in the home, and awareness of such abuse can assist \njuvenile authorities in structuring an appropriate plan of care.\"  Id.  at 236.  Then \nassessing the risks to the well-being of the juveniles and institutional safety from not \nconducting the searches as compared to the risks to the psychological health of the \nchildren from performing the searches, the court held that \"strip searches upon initial \nadmission do not violate Fourth Amendment standards.\"  Id.  at 237.  A dissenting \njudge concluded that the strip searches were unconstitutional because the State had \nfailed to demonstrate a \"close and  substantial  relationship\" of the invasive strip \nsearches to a legitimate governmental need.  Id. at 242 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). \nSmook's constitutional claim is not as strong as that of the juveniles in NG., \nbecause she was not subjected to a full strip search.  She was taken to a private \nrestroom by a female staff person, who explained that she would search Smook's \n-7-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 1174\nclothes for drugs, drug paraphernalia, and weapons. The staff person directed Smook \nto remove her shorts, t-shirt, and sandals, and then turned the clothes inside-out, \npulled the pockets inside-out, and looked through the sandals to ensure that they did \nnot have a false bottom.  (Appellants' App. at 30).  Smook remained attired in her \nundergarments, which she testified placed her at the same level of undress as if she \nwere \"at the beach in a swimsuit.\"  (ld. at 33).  The staff person touched Smook to \nlook under her arms, between her toes, and through her hair and scalp.  (ld.  at 30). \nAfter searching the clothing, the staff member returned the clothes to Smook and \nallowed her to get dressed.  (ld.). \nWe conclude that this search was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth \nAmendment.  The legitimate interests of the State, surveyed by the Second Circuit in \nN G., were present in this case and weigh in favor of reasonableness.  The search, \nwhile intrusive to a degree, presented a lesser invasion of privacy than a full strip \nsearch.  It has  been observed that  strip  searches  requiring a person to  disrobe \ncompletely have a \"uniquely invasive and upsetting nature,\" NG., 382 F.3d at 239 \n(Sotomayor,  J.,  dissenting),  and the  decision of JDC  officials to perform a less \nintrusive  search  distinguishes  this  incident  from  the  close  constitutional  issue \npresented  in  N G.  We  do  not  gainsay  that  requiring  a  minor  disrobe  to  her \nundergarments, even in a private room with only one staff member ofthe same sex, \nmay still be a stressful and disturbing experience. But even the dissenting opinion in \nN G.  did not question that a juvenile detention facility could justity \"a potentially \ninvasive search of some kind - such as a frisk search or a thorough search of all of a \ndetainee's clothing and possessions,\" id.  at 244, and there are obvious practical \ndifficulties in conducting a thorough search of a detainee's clothing while the detainee \nis wearing them. In light ofthe State's legitimate responsibility to act in loco parentis \nwith respect to juveniles in lawful state custody, we conclude that after weighing the \nspecial needs for the search against the invasion of personal rights involved, the \nbalance tips in favor of reasonableness.  We thus conclude that Banbury and Cheever \ndid not. violate Smook's constitutional rights. \n-8-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 1175\nOur decision in Doe v.  Little Rock School District, 380 F.3d 349 (8th Cir. \n2004), does not dictate a different conclusion.  In that case, our court held that a \npractice of sUbjecting secondary public school students to  random,  suspicionless \nsearches of their persons and belongings by school officials was unconstitutional. As \npart of the analysis, we observed that \"the fruits of the searches at issue here are \napparently regularly turned over to law enforcement officials and are used in criminal \nproceedings against students whose contraband is  discovered.\"  Id.  at 355.  We \nconcluded that \"[r]ather than acting in loco parentis, with the goal of promoting the \nstudents' welfare, the government officials conducting the searches are in large part \nplaying a law enforcement role with the goal of ferreting out crime and collecting \nevidence to be used in prosecuting students.\"  Id. \nSmook points out that the JDC policy at issue here provides that the  law \nenforcement officer admitting a juvenile to the facility should stay at the JDe until the \ncompletion of the search, that any contraband found on ajuvenile is to be taken by the \npolice  officer,  and  that \"it is  the  officer's  decision  regarding  further  charges.\" \n(Appellees'  App. at 59).  Smook argues that because the searches may produce \nevidence that an officer could refer to a prosecutor in support of potential criminal \ncharges, the analysis inDoe compels a finding that the searches are unreasonable. The \nDoe decision, however, should not be read to establish that a suspicion less search \nbased on \"special needs\" is per se unconstitutional whenever the fruits ofthe searches \nmay potentially be used in criminal proceedings.  In that case, we inferred from the \navailable evidence that the officials conducting searches acted \"with the goal of \nferreting out crime and collecting evidence,\" rather than \"with the goal ofpromoting \nthe students' welfare.\"  380 F.3d at 355. \nWe do not draw the same inference from the evidence here.  Officers already \nare permitted to search juvenile arrestees for evidence as an incident oft he arrest, even \nfor a minor offense, see Atwater v. City ofL ago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 354-55 (2001); \nid. at 364 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), and the goals of law enforcement to gather \nevidence are  thus  largely  satisfied prior to  admission at  the  JDC.  We  are  not \n-9-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 1176\npersuaded that the JDC' s profession of concern for the welfare of juveniles admitted \nto the facility is merely a pretextual explanation for searches that are in large part \ndesigned to gather evidence for criminal prosecutions.  As outlined above and in the \ndecision in N. G., a residential facility like the JDC has sound reasons to act in loco \nparentis, and the incidental possibility that evidence might be discovered and referred \nto  a  criminal  prosecutor  (no  example  of which  is  disclosed  in  this  record)  is \ninsufficient to render the search of Smook unreasonable. \nBecause Minnehaha County's appeal regarding liability for the search ofS  mook \nis inextricably intertwined with the appeal of the individual defendants, see Avalos v. \nCity of Glenwood, 382 F.3d 792,801 & n.1 (8th Cir. 2004); Kincade v.  City of Blue \nSprings, 64 F.3d 389, 394-95 (8th Cir. 1995), we have jurisdiction to consider the \ncounty's appeal on that point.  For the reasons discussed, we likewise conclude that, \nassuming  there was  a direct  causal  link between the  search of Smook and the \nmunicipal policy, see City ofC  anton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378,385 (1989), the county \ndid not violate Smook's constitutional rights. \nAlternatively, assuming for the sake of argument that the district court was \ncorrect that there is no constitutional distinction between searches of juveniles in \nundergarments and searches of juveniles stripped of all clothing, and assuming the \ndistrict  court's  conclusion  that  all  such  searches  without  probable  cause  are \nunreasonable, we hold that Banbury and Cheever are entitled to qualified immunity \nfrom claims for damages arising from the search of Smook in 1999.  As of that year, \nthere was no appellate decision from the Supreme Court, this court, or any other \nfederal circuit ruling on the reasonableness of strip searches of juveniles in lawful \n2 \nstate custody. See N. G., 382 F .3 d at 233. Our court, like many others, had cone luded \n20ne federal appellate decision in 1992 held that \"law enforcement officers may \nconduct a strip search of a juvenile in custody, even for a minor offense, based upon \nreasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  juvenile  is  concealing  weapons  or \ncontraband.\"  Justice  v.  City of Peachtree,  961  F.2d  188,  193  (11th Cir.  1992) \n-10-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 11 of 16 PageID #: 1177\nthat  a  strip  search  of adult  offenders  without  individualized  SuspICiOn  was \nunreasonable, but those cases did not consider the different interests involved when \nthe State has responsibility to act in loco parentis. \nTo  defeat  a  claim  of  qualified  immunity,  the  contours  of an  alleged \nconstitutional  right must be \"sufficiently clear that  a  reasonable official would \nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. \n635, 640 (1987).  Qualified immunity analysis \"must be undertaken in light of the \nspecific context ofthe case, not as a broad general proposition.\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 \nU.S. 194,201 (2001).  Here, no governing appellate decision had decided how to \nstrike the \"reasonableness\" balance in the situation ofj uvenile detainees, and as late \nas 2004, the Second Circuit concluded not only that the asserted right of juvenile \ndetainees to be free from strip searches was not clearly established, but that the right \ndid not even exist.  The conclusion in N.G., at a minimum, was within the range of \nobjectively reasonable determinations that an official might have reached about the \nlawfulness of strip searches at the JDC in 1999.  Even if we have misapprehended \nhow the Supreme Court would resolve the \"reasonableness\" balance on Smook's \nclaim, we reach the alternative conclusion that Banbury and Cheever are entitled to \nqualified immunity for allegedly acting in a manner consistent with, or less intrusive \nthan, a practice that the Second Circuit later held to be reasonable and constitutional. \nIn addition to granting partial summary judgment in favor of Smook, the district \ncourt's order also granted partial summary judgment for unnamed class members who, \n(emphasis added). The Eleventh Circuit said that \"the strip search of a juvenile based \non less than probable cause 'instinctively gives us the most pause,''' id. (quoting Bell \nv. Wolfish, 411 U.S. at 558), but the court neither reached a holding nor uttered further \ndictum on the constitutionality of strip searching juveniles at a police station, without \nprobable cause, after an arrest for a minor offense. Uncertain dictum from a different \ncircuit on a search arising in a different context surely did not establish clearly as of \n1999 that strip searches at the Juvenile Detention Center in Minnehaha County were \nunreasonable. \n-11-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 12 of 16 PageID #: 1178\nas the class was defined by the court, were strip searched at the JDe from June 1, \n1999, through September 14, 1999.  Banbury and Cheever contend that they are also \nentitled to qualified immunity from suits for damages by the unnamed class members. \nTo review that contention, it appears that we would be required by the Supreme \nCourt's current direction to resolve first whether the searches of the unnamed class \nmembers violated the Fourth Amendment, and then, if so, whether the defendants are \nnonetheless entitled to qualified immunity.  See Brosseau v.  Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, \n197-98 &  n.3  (2004) (per curiam); Saucier, 533 U.S. at 200; see also Bunting v. \nMellen,  541  U.S.  1019,  1024-25  (2004)  (Scalia,  J.,  dissenting  from  denial  of \ncertiorari). \nThe requirement to resolve the reasonableness of these searches of unnamed \nclass members places us in a quandary.  The specific facts underlying the claims are \nnot yet developed, and the reasonableness of a particular search is  often highly \ncontextual.  We do not know from this record which, if any, of the unnamed class \nmembers were searched after removing all oftheir clothing, what might have led staff \nmembers at the IDC to conduct such searches (e.g., whether they simply followed a \npolicy by rote, or whether they exercised discretion based on such factors as whether \nparticular undergarments were unusually capable of concealing contraband), whether \nany  such  searches may  have  involved reasonable suspicion, probable cause,  or \nconsent, and so forth.  Plaintiffs contend that \"[t]he question of whether individual \nclass members were required to be completely nude or nearly nude will be determined \namong the factual matters during the damages phase of the case,\" (Appellees' Br. at \n14 n.8), yet the entitlement to qualified immunity is an immunity from suit, not merely \na defense to liability, Mitchellv. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985), and the individual \ndefendants are thus entitled to a decision before the litigation proceeds to that phase. \nThe posture oft he appeal is complicated further by our decision that the named \nclass representative, Smook, has no claim for damages against the defendants.  That \nconclusion typically would disqualify her as a class representative, see, e.g., E.  Tex. \nMotor Freight Sys. Inc.  v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403-04 (1977); Burris v.  First \n-12-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 13 of 16 PageID #: 1179\nFin. Corp., 928 F.2d 797,806 (8th Cir. 1991), but given that a class already has been \ncertified, \"the class of unnamed persons described in the certification acquire a legal \nstatus separate from the interest asserted by [Smook].\" Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, \n398 (1975). This separate legal status means that the dismissal of Smook's claim does \nnot inexorably require dismissal of the class action, id. at 399-401; Rodriguez, 431 \nU.S. at 406 n.12; but cf Great Rivers Coop. o/Southeastern Iowa v. Farmland Indus., \nInc., 120 F.3d 893, 899 (8th Cir. 1997), but it also does not mandate that we decide \nconstitutional issues in the abstract or in a context that may be hypothetical.  See \nKremens v.  Bartley, 431  U.S.  119,  134 (1977) (\"While there are  'live' disputes \nbetween unnamed members of the class certified by the District Court, on the one \nhand, and [defendants], on the other, these disputes are so unfocused as to make \ninformed resolution of them almost impossible.\"). \nUnder these unusual circumstances, we decline to pass on the merits of the \nconstitutional claims of the unnamed class members that must be resolved as a first \nstep in determining whether Banbury and Cheever are entitled to qualified immunity \nfrom suit.  Because we decline to resolve this aspect of the appeal by the individual \ndefendants, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction that portion of the county's appeal \nregarding liability for  damages to the unnamed class members.  On remand, the \ndistrict court may consider, after pausing to \"stop, look,  and listen,\" id.  at 135, \nwhether the class should be redefined or decertified, cf Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 \nU.S. 147, 160 (1982), and whether there is an adequate class representative to replace \nSmook, if appropriate.  Cf Howe v.  Varity Corp., 896 F.2d 1107, 1111  (8th Cir. \n1990).  Ifthe court concludes that a class should continue to be certified and there is \nan adequate class representative to continue the action, then the defendants, of course, \nmay renew motions for summary judgment if they wish.  We expect that the district \ncourt would consider any such motions in  light of our conclusions regarding the \nindividual defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity from suit on Smook's claim. \n-13-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 14 of 16 PageID #: 1180\nB. \nThe  defendants  also  appeal  the  district court's finding  of liability  on  the \nplaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief with respect to future searches of juveniles \ndetained for \"minor offenses.\" This appeal includes a challenge to the district court's \nconclusion that the JDC may not, consistent with the Constitution, conduct future \nsearches comparable to the search of Smook. As to that aspect ofthe appeal from the \ndistrict court's determinations concerning injunctive relief, we agree with the parties \nthat the issues oflaw are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the determination of whether \nBanbury  and Cheever are entitled to  qualified immunity  on Smook's claim for \ndamages, such that appellate jurisdiction is proper. See Gardner v. Howard, 109 F.3d \n427,431 (8th Cir.  1997); Kincade, 64 F.3d at 394-95.  Before we may reach the \nmerits, however, we must first satisfY ourselves that the action for injunctive relief \npresented a \"case or controversy\" over which the district court properly exercised \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Steel Co.  v.  Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S.  83, 94 \n(1998). Having carefully reviewed Smook's complaint with that question in mind, we \nconclude that she and the class certified by the district court lack standing to seek \ninjunctive relief. \nThe  allegations  of the  complaint  relate  entirely  to  past  conduct  by  the \ndefendants that occurred when Smook and others were arrested for minor offenses in \nAugust 1999.  The district court's order certifYing a class defined the relevant class \nas encompassing \"all persons seeking injunctive reiiefwho, when they [were] under \nthe age of eighteen years old, were charged with minor offenses and were, pursuant \nto JDC policy strip searched ... at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center \nfrom June 1, 1999 through September 14, 1999.\"  There is no allegation about the \nlikelihood of future contact with the JDC or future unreasonable searches. \nIt is well settled that \"[pl ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show \na present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief ... if unaccompanied by any \ncontinuing, present adverse effects.\"  0 'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495 (1974). \n-14-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 15 of 16 PageID #: 1181\nThere is no allegation in the complaint that Smook or the certified class members are \nsuffering any \"continuing, present adverse effects\" from searches conducted between \nJune 1 and September 14,  1999.  There is no assertion that the plaintiffs expect to \ncommit additional minor offenses in Minnehaha County, or that they are likely to be \ndetained at the JDC.  And there is no allegation that if the plaintiffs were detained at \nthe JDC for a minor offense in the future, then they would be unable to take advantage \nof the two-hour grace period for parental pick-up, which now permits a juvenile to \navoid any kind of search when detained for a minor offense.  Even if the face of the \ncomplaint did include a general assertion of future injury, we think that attempting to \nanticipate whether any ofthe plaintiffs would actually be detained and strip searched \nwould take us \"into the area of speculation and conjecture.\" [d.  at 497; see also City \nof Los Angeles v.  Lyons, 461  U.S.  95,  105  (1983) (\"That Lyons may have been \nillegally choked by the police on October 6, 1976, while presumably affording Lyons \nstanding to claim damages against the individual officers and perhaps against the City, \ndoes nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that he would again be stopped \nfor a traffic violation, or for any other offense, by an officer or officers who would \nillegally choke him into unconsciousness without any provocation or resistence on his \npart.\"); Hedgepeth v.  Washington Metro.  Transit Auth., 386 F.3d 1148, 1152 (D.C. \nCir. 2004) (Roberts, J.). \nAbsent a sufficient allegation that Smook and other class members are likely \nto  be strip searched at the JDC  in  the  future,  they are \"no more entitled to an \ninjunction than any other citizen.\" Lyons, 461 U.S. at 111. And \"a federal court may \nnot entertain a claim by any or all citizens who no more than assert that certain \npractices of (juvenile detention officials] are unconstitutional.\"  [d.  The Supreme \nCourt has explained that this limitation on the authority of the federal courts does not \nmean that \"undifferentiated claims should not be taken seriously by local authorities,\" \nfor \"the interest of an alert and interested citizen is an essential element of an effective \nand fair government.\" [d.  Indeed, in this very case, the claims by Jodie Smook that \nshe was unreasonably searched at the JDC triggered a modification ofthe institution's \npolicy on searching minors, and prompted a statewide discussion that culminated in \n-15-\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 154    Filed 10/13/06   Page 16 of 16 PageID #: 1182\nlegislation prohibiting strip searches, without probable cause, ofj uveniles detained for \ncurfew violations.  But a federal court \"is not the proper forum to press such claims \nunless  the  requirements  for  entry  and the prerequisites  for  injunctive relief are \nsatisfied.\" Id. at 112.  We therefore conclude that the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive \nrelief should be dismissed for lack of an Article III case-or-controversy. \n*  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is reversed, and the \ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n-16-",

For the reasons stated below, the Motion to Compel \nis granted, subject to a protective order, on the condition that Plaintiff first obtain release of the \nrecords from the Circuit COllrt of Minnehaha County. \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiff alleges that her civil rights were violated  at  the Minnehaha County Juvenile \nDetention Center (JDC).  According to the Complaint, Plaintiff and three of her minor friends were \ntaken into custody on August 8, 1999, after Sioux Falls policemen found them out after the city's \n11 :00 p.m. curfew for children under the age of eighteen.  At the time, Plaintiff was sixteen years \nold.  She and her friends were transported to the JDC where, allegedly, they were questioned about \ntheir religious beliefs and practices, individually ordered into a bathroom, and strip searched. \nPlaintiff claims that these actions violated her constitutional rights. \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 24    Filed 05/22/01   Page 2 of 7 PageID #: 80\nPlaintiff also alleges that she and her friends are not the only minors who were asked about \ntheir religious beliefs and strip searched at the JDC.  According to the Complaint, the mc had a \npolicy of conducting strip searches of minors, even without probable cause that the minors had \nweapons or contraband, as well as a policy of questioning juvenile detainees about the religious \nbeliefs and practices.  Plaintiff alleges that more than 100 minors were subjected to each of the \nJDC's policies, and seeks to certify a class consisting of \"all persons who have been injured in any \nway by the unconstitutional practices, acts, and policies of the defendants and their agents.\" \nWith an eye toward class certification, which has not yet been granted, Plaintiff has sought \ndiscovery relating to the class. In particular, Plaintiffhas propounded an interrogatory asking, with \nrespect to each minor who was taken to the JDC for a curfew violation between November I, 1997 \nand November 1,2000: (a) date ofb irth, (b) social security number, (c) gender, (d) date and time the \nminor was admitted and released, (e) whether the minor was strip searched, (1) name oft he employee \nor officer who conducted the search, (g) why the strip search was conducted, (h) whether any \ncontraband or weapons were discovered as a result of the search, (i) any charge or charges lodged \nagainst the minor, and (j) disposition of the charge brought against the minor.  (PI. First Set of \nInterrogatories to Def. Banbury '14.) Plaintiffhas also sought the same information with respect to \nminors who were strip searched during the same time period and who were charged with offenses \nother than drug offenses, violent offenses, or weapons offenses.  (Id. ~ 5.) \nDefendants obj ected to the above-described interrogatories on the grounds that they seek \ninformation  from  which  state  law  prohibits  them  from  disclosing,  and  that  answering  the \ninterrogatories would be  unduly burdensome.  Plaintiff has brought a motion to compel the \nDefendants' response. \nDISCUSSION \nIn class actions, it is often necessary for the named plaintiffs to produce factual evidence, in \naddition to their allegations, before a class may be certified.  See General Telephone Co. v. Falcon, \n457 U.S. 147,160,102 S. Ct. 2364,2372,72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982) (noting that \"it maybe necessary \nfor the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on a certification question\"). \n2 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 24    Filed 05/22/01   Page 3 of 7 PageID #: 81\nConsequently, a federal district court may permit discovery prior to class certification, in order to \nprovide the plaintiffan opportunity to satisfy the requirements for maintaining a class action. Witten \nv. A.H. Smith & Co., 104 F.R.D. 398, 399 (D. Mary. 1984); see also Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal \nPractice and Procedure: Civil2d ยง 1796.1 (1986); Manual for Complex Litigation (Third) ยง 30.12 \n(2000).  Of course, discovery should not be allowed to a plaintiff who is seeking facts to support \nallegations of class-wide injury for which she has no support in the first place.  Witten, 104 F.3d at \n399. \nIn this case, it does not appear that the Plaintiff has embarked on a fishing expedition. The \nComplaint alleges that three minors besides her were strip searched and asked about their religious \nbeliefs and practices.  The blank admission form attached to Plaintiffs Motion to Compel also \nsuggests that such actions were matters of policy.  The form includes spaces to write down the \ndetainee's \"religious preference\" and \"attendance,\" as well as spaces to inventory pants, shirts, \nsocks, and \"briefs/panties.\"  The local news media also carried articles on the JDC's alleged strip \nsearch policy.  While the Plaintiff may be unsure whether her claims are typical of those of the \npurported class and whether she can adequately represent that class, there is a sufficient factual basis \nfor her allegations of class-wide harm to permit further discovery. \nThe principal obstacle to further discovery is South Dakota's policy of confidentiality with \nrespect to records of juvenile delinquency.  One South Dakota statute provides: \nThe records oflaw enforcement officers and agencies concerning all children taken \ninto temporary custody or issued a summons or citation [under certain statutes \n1 \npertaining to juvenile justice  shall be maintained separately from the records of \narrest and any other records regarding detention of adult persons.  The records \nconcerning children, including their names, may not be inspected or disclosed to the \npublic except: \n(1)  By order ofthe court; \n(2)  If the court orders the child to be held for criminal proceedings, as \nprovided in chapter 26-11; \n(3)  If  there  has  been  a  criminal  conviction  and  a  presentence \ninvestigation is being made on an application for probation; or \n3 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 24    Filed 05/22/01   Page 4 of 7 PageID #: 82\n(4)  Any child or the child's parent or guardian may authorize the release \nof records to representatives of the United States military for the \npurpose of enlistment into the military service. \nSDCL 26-7A-27.  Another statute provides: \nNo fingerprint, photograph, name, address or other information concerning the \nidentity of any child taken into temporary custody or issued a summons or citation \n1 \n[under the same statutes pertaining to juvenile justice may be released or transmitted \nto the federal bureau of investigation or any other person or agency except in the \nfollowing instances: \n(1)  To the person or party specifically authorized by order of the court; \nand \n(2)  To courts, law enforcement agencies, prosecuting attorneys, court \nservices officers and the department of social services if the child is \nan adjudicated delinquent offender. \n*  *  * \nSDCL 26-7 A-28. Neither ofthese statutes specifies the circumstances under which \"the court\" may \norder the release of information. \nThe Court is inclined to grant the Motion to Compel.  However, under the statutes quoted \nabove, this Court has no power to order the release of records from the JDC.  The statutes do not \nprovide for the release of information by order of \"a court,\" they require an order of \"the court.\" \nSDCL ยงยง 26-7 A-27(1), 26-7A  -28(l).  For purposes of these statutes, the term \"court\" is expressly \ndefined as the State circuit court.  SDCL 26A-7A-l(IO).  In order to obtain release of the records, \nthe Plaintiff must apply to the Circuit Court of Minnehaha County.! \nIf Plaintiff eventually obtains such records, the records will be subject to a protective order \nissued by this Court. Such an order may issue, as justice requires, \"to protect a party or person from \nannoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).  The \nissuance of a protective order is particularly appropriate in a case which, like this one, requires the \nUnder appropriate conditions, South Dakota law permits the disclosure of \nconfidential juvenile records.  See E.P. v. Riley, 604 N.W.2d 7,18-19 (S.D. 1999). \n4 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 24    Filed 05/22/01   Page 5 of 7 PageID #: 83\ndisclosure of confidential infonnation for the development of the plaintiffs case.  See Pearson v. \nMiller, 211 F.3d 57, 72-73 (3d Cir. 2000); Gillard v. Boulder Valley SchoolDist RE-2, 196 F.R.D. \n382, 386 (D. Colo. 2000). \nThe decision whether to issue such a protective order, as well as the order itself, must balance \nthe Plaintiff's legitimate discovery interests with the legitimate interests that potential class members \nhave in keeping their juvenile records secret. See Pearson, 211 F.3d at 73. It must also weigh South \nDakota's independent interest in maintaining the confidentiality of its juvenile justice records.  See \nRiley, 604 N.W.2d at 18-19 (the consent to disclosure of records by ajuvenile and his mother did \nnot, by itself, mandate release of the records).  Finally, in a class action, the order should also take \ninto account society's interest in the efficient administration ofj ustice. \nIn this case, the balance of these interests points decidedly toward the entry of a protective \norder. The disclosure ofj uvenile justice records will enable the Plaintiffto develop evidence related \nto class certification and to the merits of her case.  The interests ofj ustice favor the development of \nevidence related to other potential plaintiffs so that as many claims as possible can be resolved in \na single lawsuit.  At this point in the litigation, however, there is no reason to pennit the disclosure \nof such infonnation to anyone except the Plaintiff's lawyers and her lawyer's employees.  See \nPearson, 211 F.3d at 73.  The Court will take steps to ensure that the identities of juveniles are not \ndisclosed to the public through the Court filings in this case. In addition, in order to protect potential \nmembers ofthe class from undue annoyance or embarrassment, the protective order will prohibit the \nPlaintiff's lawyers from contacting potential class members through the use ofinfonnation in the \nconfidential records. \nIn the meantime, the Plaintiff may still bring a motion for class certification.  Given the \ninitial obstacles to discovering relevant infonnation, the Court will take a liberal view toward \ncertification ofa class.  See Cook v. Rockwell Tnt'! Corp., 151 F.R.D. 378, 381 (D. Colo. 1993); \nWright, Miller & Kane, supra, ยง 1785 at 128-33.

Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225  (2d Cir. 2004), issued on September 7,  2004. \n(Memorandum Opinion and Order, Doc. 116, September 27,2004.)  The motion has been fully \nbriefed and having carefully considered the parties' arguments and the entire record in this case, the \nCourt has considered the Motion to Reconsider and it is granted to the extent that liability on \nPlaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim and the qualified immunity issue are reconsidered on the merits. \nAfter such reconsideration, the Court again finds that Defendants are liable on Plaintiffs' Fourth \nAmendment claim and that Defendants Jim Banbury and Todd Cheever are not entitled to qualified \nimmunity on Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim. \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 2 of 13 PageID #: 1109\nBACKGROUND \nOn September 27,2004, the Court held that the Juvenile Detention Center's (\"JDC\") blanket \npolicy  of strip  searching  minors  arrested  for  minor  or  non-felony  ofi(mses,  without  any \nindividualized determination of reasonable suspicion that the individual was or is likely to be \ncarrying or concealing weapons, drugs or other contraband, violates the Fourth Amendment.  See \nSmook v.  Minnehaha County, 340 F.Supp.2d 1037, 1050 (D.S.D. 2004).  The Court applied the \nbalancing test in Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979), to determine whether the JDC's strip \nsearch policy in existence at the relevant time period violated the Fourth Amendment: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need \nfor the particular search against the invasion ofp ersonal rights that the search entails. \nCourts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \nSee Smook, 340 F.Supp.2d at 1042-43 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 559).  The Second Circuit applied \nthe \"overarching principle\" set forth in Bell in conducting '\" a fact-specific balancing oft he intrusion \n... against the promotion oflegitimate governmental interests. \", N. G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d at \n230-31 (quoting Board o/Education v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822,829 (2002ยป. The Second Circuit held \nthat \"[a ]ssessing all of the circumstances - the risks to the psychological health ofthe children from \nperforming the searches and the risks to their well-being and to  institutional safety from not \nperforming the searches, we conclude that the strip searches upon initial admission do not violate \nFourth Amendment standards.\" N. G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d at 237.  The Second Circuit did not \nevaluate the facial validity of the strip search policy, but held that two ofthe strip searches involved \nin that case did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  See id. at 230 n.6. In the present case, the Court \nevaluated both the facial validity of the JDC's strip search policy and the strip search of Plaintiff \nSmook.  Under the facts of the present case, the Court reached the opposite conclusion from the \nSecond Circuit in conducting the fact-specific balancing of the intrusion of the privacy of Plaintiff \nSmook and other juveniles admitted to  the JDC  against  the promotion of JDC's legitimate \ngovernmental interests.  See Smook, 340 F.Supp.2d at 1050. \n2 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 3 of 13 PageID #: 1110\nDISCUSSION \nDefendants brought their motion for reconsideration under Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules \nofC  ivil Procedure. The Court recognizes that it may reconsider its rulings on the summary judgment \nmotions because judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties \nhas not been entered in this case.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). \nA.  Liability on Fourth Amendment Claim \nThe initial issue to be addressed is Defendants' failure to recognize the Court's factual \nfindings regarding the breadth of the mc's strip search policy in existence at the relevant time \nperiod.  While Defendants continue to repeatedly assert in their brief that the strip search policy in \neffect at the time of Plaintiffs search did not require juveniles to remove their undergannents, \nDefendants disregard the evidence on record and the Court's finding that the written policy in effect \nat that time did require juveniles to remove their undergannents while being strip searched.  See \nSmook, 340 F.Supp.2d at 1040. Thus, Defendants' contention that the strip search policyin this case \nwas less intrusive than the strip searches held constitutional by the Second Circuit is erroneous. To \nargue that the Court was wrong in its fact finding is one way to approach that issue.  To fail to even \nacknowledge the facts as found by the Court results in a brief that is of no assistance to the Court. \nThe Court acknowledges the Second Circuit's statement that \"[s]trip searches of children \npose the reasonableness inquiry in a context where both the interests supporting and opposing such \nsearches appear to be greater than with searches of adults confined for minor offenses.\"  N. G.  v. \nConnecticut, 382 F.3d at 232. The Second Circuit's decision, however, does not convince the Court \nthat the JDC's strip search policy results in reasonable searches under Fourth Amendment standards. \nThe  dissent  in  NG.  v.  Connecticut,  382  F.3d  at  238-45,  articulates  much  of this  Court's \ndisagreement with the Second Circuit's decision.  Specifically, the Court agrees with the dissent in \nN G. v. Connecticut, that the majority opinion \"overstates the relevance\" of several non-prison cases \nupholding drug testing of stud ents or employees who have voluntarily engaged in the job or activity \nthat required testing and \"downplays the significance of the most closely analogous case it cites, \nJustice v. City a/Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11 th Cir. 1992).\" N G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d \n3 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 4 of 13 PageID #: 1111\nat 241 (dissenting opinion).  This Court does respectfully submit that the majority opinion in N. G. \nv. Connecticut, fails to adeqnately credit the fact that juveniles are not young adults.  Harsh and \npotentially scaring treatment ofj uveniles suspected ofm  inor offenses, such as driving while revoked, \ncannot be justified by an in loco parentis rationale when the primary approach of the government \npersonnel is one ofj uvenile law enforcement.  Those government officials should be more attuned \nto the different susceptibilities of juveniles as opposed to treating juveniles as people with fewer \nrights as to their person when compared with adults.  Additionally, similar to the dissent in N. G. v. \nConnecticut,382 F.3d at 241, the Eighth Circuit recently recognized the distinction between being \nsubjected to a search at the hands of State officials in a situation where one voluntarily participates \nin an activity that requires random searches compared to being searched without having voluntarily \nparticipated in the activity allowing for random searches. See Doe v. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 380 F.3d \n349, 353-54 (8th Cir. 2004). \nThe Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Justice, supra, was relied upon by the Court in weighing \nthe various  interests in  this  case  to  detennine whether the  JDC's policy violated the Fourth \nAmendment.  See Smook, 340 F.Supp.2d at 1047-48.  The Second Circuit's opinion does not alter \nthe Court's view oft he soundness oftheprincipJes recognized by the Eleventh Circuit inJustice, 961 \nF.2d at 193, or that decision's relevance to the question of whether the JDC's strip search policy in \nthis case is unconstitutional.  As recognized by the Eleventh Circuit, \"[i]t is axiomatic that a strip \nsearch represents a serious intrusion upon personal rights.\" Id. at 192. In discussing the seriousness \nof a strip search of a juvenile, the Eleventh Circuit recognized that '\" [c ]hildren are especially \nsusceptible to possible traumas from strip searches ....  \"[Y]outh is more than a chronological fact. \nIt is  a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to \npsychological damage.\"'\" Id. at 192-93 (citations omitted). \nIn addition to the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Justice, 961 F.2d at 193, the Court relied \nupon the Eighth Circuit's decision in Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 741 (8th Cir. 1985), inholding \nthat the JDC's policy is unconstitutional.  Similar to the arguments in Jones, the Defendants in this \ncase raise security concerns as ajustification for their blanket strip search policy. In Jones, the court \n4 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 5 of 13 PageID #: 1112\nrejected the argument that security concerns could justify a blanket policy of strip searching all \npersons arrested for minor offenses who were admitted to the jail without some individualized \nsuspicion. 770 F .2d at 741-72. In an attempt to distinguish Jones from the present case, Defendants \nassert that the State has a higher governmental interest in protecting the security ofj uvenile detainees \nthan it does in protecting adult detainees. Whether the Defendants have a heightened duty to protect \njuveniles, however, does not translate into higher security concerns and more intrusive searches. In \ndiscussing the serious security dangers in a detention center, police station or jail holding cell, the \nEleventh Circuit held that, \"[ t ]he considerations regarding contraband are the same whether the \ndetainee is ajuvenile or an adult.\" Justice, 961 F.2d at 193.  The Court concurs with the Eleventh \nCircuit that officials in charge of a juvenile detention facility and an adult prison or jail have the \nsame security concern: assuring that weapons and other contraband are not introduced into the secure \nfacilities. Although controlling the admission of weapons and other contraband into the JDC present \nlegitimate security concerns, as in Jones, these security concerns do not justify a blanket policy of \nstrip searching all juveniles admitted to the JDC for non-felony and minor offenses. \nThe Defendants assert that, \"[i]f the JDC abides by this Court's current holding and only \nsearches juveniles when it has a reasonable suspicion to believe that they possess weapons or \ncontraband, undoubtably, some weapons and contraband will find their way into the JDC facility.\" \n(Defendants' Briefin Support of Motion for Reconsideration Under Rule 54(b), Doc. 130 at p. 10 \n(emphasis added).) The Court has already concluded, however, that the record in this case does not \ndemonstrate that the incidence of smuggling weapons or contraband into the JDC is more than \nminimal.  See Smook, 340 F.Supp.2d at 1045.  There is an absence of evidence in the record to \nsupport the Defendants' broad prediction of what might happen if JDC staff are required to have \nreasonable suspicion before strip searching juveniles charged with minor or non-felony offenses. \nIn support of their claim that it is necessary to search all juveniles for weapons and other \ncontraband, Defendants submitted an Affidavit of Todd Cheever, Doc. 88, the current Director of \nthe JDC.  He states that, \"[ u ]pon admission to the JDC, juveniles sometimes attempt to introduce \nweapons or contraband into the facility.\"  (Doc. 88, ~ 3 (emphasis added).).  Cheever further states \n5 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 6 of 13 PageID #: 1113\nthat he has in his possession at the JDC \"a large box of weapons and contraband representing \n'14.) \nmaterials found on admittees over the years.\" (Doc. 88,  As the Court initially concluded, this \nevidence does not demonstrate that the incidence of smuggling weapons or contraband into the JDC \nis more than minimal. This evidence is inconclusive as to the time period within which the one large \nbox of weapons or contraband was collected as well as what was contraband and what were \nweapons. More critical, this evidence fails to show that the weapons or contraband were seized from \njuveniles charged with non-felony or minor offenses or that the weapons or contraband were \ndiscovered as  a result of strip searches, rather than other less invasive searches that may be \nconstitutionally performed by mc staff.  Thus, similar to the state officials in the Eighth Circuit's \nrecent case, Doe,  380 F.3d at 352-53, the Defendants have, \"in fact failed to demonstrate the \nexistence of a need sufficient to justify the substantial intrusions upon the [juvenile]'s privacy \ninterests that the search practice entails.\" \nAnother consideration the  Defendants  suggest  should  weigh  heavily in  favor  of the \nreasonableness of the strip search policy is that the State acts as a de facto guardian of children \nlawfully removed from their home when they are in the custody of the JDC.  The Defendants do not \naddress, however, the distinction in the reasonableness inquiry the Eighth Circuit made from \nsearches that, \"can lead directiyto the imposition ofp unitive criminal sanctions,\" from searches that \nwill not lead to criminal sanctions. Doe, 380 F.3d at 355. Ifa search can lead to criminal sanctions, \n\"[rlather than acting in  loco parentis, with the goal of promoting the students'  welfare,  the \ngovernment officials conducting the searches are in large part playing a law enforcement role with \nthe goal of ferreting out crime and collecting evidence to be used in prosecuting students.\"  [d. \nSignificantly, the JDC's written policy required law enforcement to remain at the JDC until a search \nwas completed and required JDC staffto give any illegal contraband to the law enforcement officer: \nOnly after the completion ofthe search is the officer to depart from the Center. Any \nillegal contraband (i.e. drug, weapons) found on a juvenile is to be taken by the police \nofficer. Ifit was necessary for the officer to leave prior to the search and contraband \nis found, contact the officer to come back and pick up the contraband.  It is the \nofficer's decision regarding further charges. \n6 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 7 of 13 PageID #: 1114\n(Doc. 95, Ex. C at D 067.) Similar to the search policy in Doe, supra, the JDC's policy demonstrates \nthat it is in large part playing a law enforcement role with the goal of ferreting out crime and \ncollecting evidence to be used to prosecute the juveniles admitted to the JDC.  Thus, in considering \nthe character of the intrusion the JDC's strip search policy imposes, the JDC's law enforcement \npurposes for which the fruits oft he strip searches are used does not weigh in favor ofc oncluding that \nthe invasion ofthe juveniles' privacy was insignificant. \nThe Defendants do not acknowledge the law enforcement purposes for conducting the strip \nsearches at issue in this case and how the that purpose relates to the JDC's asserted purpose for \nconducting the strip searches, i.e. acting in loco parentis.  Likewise, the Second Circuit in N. G. v. \nConnecticut, discusses a juvenile detention's responsibility to act in loco parentis, but it does not \ndiscuss how this responsibility relates to the law enforcement purposes for conducting strip searches \non juveniles admitted for minor or non-felony offenses.  382 F.3d at 232.  Thus, neither the \nDefendants nor the Second Circuit have evaluated a consideration that the Eighth Circuit has found \nhighly relevant in evaluating the reasonableness of searches involving juveniles under the Fourth \nAmendment.  See Doe, 380 F.3d at 355. \nAnother issue raised by Defendants is that they must be \"alert for children who are angry \nabout the arrest, violent, depressed, suicidal, gang members, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, \netc.\" (Defendants' Brief, Doc. 130, atp. 8.) The fallacy with this argument is that ifajuvenile being \nadmitted to the IDC displays the behaviors or raises such concerns, JDC staff may have reasonable \nsuspicion that such a juvenile is carrying or concealing weapons or contraband and a strip search \nwould be allowed under the Court's holding. It is important to recognize that the Court's ruling does \nnot prohibit all strip searches.  Rather, the Court's holding requires a finding of individualized \nreasonable suspicion of carrying or concealing weapons or other contraband before conducting a \nstrip search of ajuvenile arrested for a minor or non-felony offense.  Moreover, the Court's holding \ndoes not prohibit strip searching juveniles arrested for more offenses more serious than minor or \nnon-felony offenses as those offenses are defined in the class definitions. \n7 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 8 of 13 PageID #: 1115\nDefendants again assert that they must strip search aU juveniles to allow JDC staff to detect \nabuse orneglect ofj uveniles. This argument was examined and rejected by the Court in the decision \ndenying summary judgment to Defendants. See Smook, 340 F.Supp.2d at 1045. As the Court found, \nJDC staff do not have a duty to detect abuse or neglect ofj uveniles.  See id.  Moreover, there is no \nevidence in this record to demonstrate that JDC staff must conduct a strip search to detect abuse or \nneglect, rather than conducting a search or examination far less invasive than a strip search.  While \nDefendants are attempting in this Motion to Reconsider to justify the JDC' s strip search policy based \nupon a supposed \"duty to detect abuse or neglect,\" Defendants do not address the harm inflicted on \njuveniles by a strip search, much less the harm that a strip search would cause an abused or neglected \nchild.  See Justice, 961  F.2d at 192-93 (recognizing that children are especially susceptible to \npossible traumas from strip searches). \nIn addition to the considerations discussed above, in denying Defendants' summary judgment \nmotion on the strip search claim, the Court relied on several circuit court decisions (cited in footnote \none below) that held strip searching arrestees of minor offenses without reasonable suspicion that \nan arrestee is carrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband violates that arrestee's Fourth \nAmendment rights. See Smook, 340 F.Supp.2d at 1043-46. While not repeated here, that decisional \nlaw was considered again in ruling on the Motion to Reconsider. \nHaving reconsidered the issue ofthe constitutionality of the JDC's strip search policy, and \nbalancing the JOC's interests against the interests of the class members, the Court again holds that \nthe JOC policy violates the class members' Fourth Amendment rights and that Plaintiff Smook's \nFourth Amendment rights were violated when she was searched on August 9,  1999.  The Court \nadheres to the prior holding that a minor charged with minor or non-felony offenses may be \nsubjected to a strip search only if JDC officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the minor is \ncarrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband.  See Smook, 340 F.Supp.2d at 1046-47. \n8 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 9 of 13 PageID #: 1116\nB.  Qualified Immunity \nThe final issue to be decided on this motion for reconsideration is whether, in light of the \nSecond Circuit's decision, Defendants Banbury and Cheever are entitled to qualified immunity.  A \ntwo-part analysis is used to  evaluate a qualified immunity defense:  \"[fJirst,  [the court]  must \ndetennine whether the plaintiffhas alleged the violation of a constitutional right. Second, [the court] \nmust detennine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\" \nManzano v. South Dakota Dep 't ofS oc. Serv., 60 F.3d 505, 509 (8th Cir. 1995) (citations omitted). \nThe qualified immunity defense is evaluated based upon the law existing at the time of the alleged \nviolation.  See Sexton v. Martin, 210 F.3d 905, 909-10 (8th Cir. 2000) (explaining that, \"[i]t is only \nnecessary that the unlawfulness of the official's act [be] apparent in view ofp re-existing law. \") \n(emphasis added). The class period began on November I, 1997, as to minor offenses and on April \n16,1999, as to non-felony offenses.  The strip search of the Plaintiff was conducted on August 9, \n1999.  Although the Court has not yet set the ending date for the class period, the Court has been \nadvised that the strip search policy was changed as of December 31, 2003.  (See Plaintiffs' Reply \nMemorandum, Doc. 125, November 15,2004.)  Thus, it questionable whether the Court should \nconsider the Second Circuit's 2004 decision inN. G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d at 237, in detennining \nwhat the state of the law was at the time of the alleged violations in this case. \nAs to the first part ofthe qualifi.ed immunity analysis, the Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and \nthe class members, allege a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, \nsatisfying the first part.  Thus, the remaining issue is whether it was clearly established during the \nclass period that the mc's written policy of strip searchingjuveniles admitted to the JDC on minor \nor non-felony offenses and without individualized suspicion that such juveniles were carrying or \nconcealing weapons  or other contraband  violated  the  Plaintiffs  and  class  members'  Fourth \nAmendment rights.  See Sexton, 210 F.3d at 910 (holding that, \"if the law claimed to have been \nviolated was clearly established, the qualified immunity defense ordinarily fails, 'since a reasonably \ncompetent public official should know the law goveming his  conduct.\"') (quoting Harlow v. \nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,818 (1982ยป. \n9 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 10 of 13 PageID #: 1117\nDiscussing the \"clearly established\" requirement in the context of a qualified immunity \ndefense, the Supreme Court explained that, \"[t]he contours oft he right must be sufficiently clear that \na reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.  This is not to say \nthat an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has \npreviously been held unlawful ... but it is to say that in light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness \nmust be apparent.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987). The lack of a Supreme Court \ndecision does not prevent a finding that a right is clearly established. The Eighth Circuit recognized \nthat in determining whether a right is clearly established for purpose of the qualified immunity \ndefense, \"[i]n the absence of binding precedent, a court should look to all available decisional law \nincluding decisions of state courts, other circuits and district courts .... \" Burnham v. Ianni, 119 F.3d \n668, 677 (8th Cir. 1997) (quotation marks and citations omitted).  The Eighth Circuit explained that \nin determining whether a right is \"clearly established\" in this circuit, the Court is to apply \"a flexible \nstandard, requiring 'some, but not precise factual correspondence' with precedent, and demanding \nthat officials apply general, well-developed legal principles.\" J.HH v. 0 'Hara, 878 F.2d 240, 243 \n(8th Cir. 1989).  In addition, the Eighth Circuit further explained that it, \"'has ... taken a broad view \nof what constitutes \"clearly established law\" for the purposes of a qualified immunity inquiry .... \", \nSexton, 21OF.3d at 909 (quoting Boxwell v. Sherburne County, 849 F.2d 1117, 1121 (8th Cir. 1988ยป. \nIn the Court's decision denying summary judgment on the strip search claim, eight federal \ncourts of appeals' decisions were cited, in addition to the Eighth Circuit's decision in Jones, 770 \nF .2d at 742, that have held strip searching arrestees of minor offenses without reasonable suspicion \nthat an arrestee is carrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband violates that arrestee's Fourth \nAmendment rights.'  See Smook, 340 F.Supp.2d at 1043-44.  The Court also cited a 1992 Eleventh \n'See Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248,1255 (6th Cir. 1989) (holding that, \"a strip search ofa \nperson arrested for a traffic violation or other minor offense not normally associated with violence and \nconcerning whom there is no individualized reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is carrying or \nconcealing a weapon orothercontraband, is unreasonable [under the Fourth Amendment].\"); Chapman \nv. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395-97 (lOti' Cir. 1993) (ruling that a strip search of arrestees pursuant to a \njail's blanket policy requiring all detainees, including those arrested for minor traffic offenses and \nawaiting bail, to be subject to a strip search violated the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights); Weber \nv. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986) (holding that strip-body cavity search of arrestee who had \n10 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 11 of 13 PageID #: 1118\nCircuit Court of Appeals decision, in which it was held that strip searches of incarcerated juveniles \nwill be upheld, but such searches require a showing of reasonable suspicion of possession of \ncontraband. See id., at 1048 (citing Justice, 961 F.2d at 190-91). \nIt is clear from the Court's discussion of Jones above that there is \"some, but not precise \nfactual correspondence\" to this case. The factual correspondence between this case and Jones is that \nthe plaintiffs were arrested for minor and non-felony offenses, they were held in custody, they were \nstrip searched without individualized suspicion that they were carrying or concealing weapons or \nother contraband, the security purposes for the searches were the same, and if the state official \nperforming the  strip  searches  found  any  illegal  items,  those  items would be seized  by  law \nenforcement officials and could result in criminal charges.  The primary distinction advanced by \nDefendants is that Jones involved an adult rather than a juvenile arrestee. This distinction is based \nupon the Defendants' responsibility to act in  loco parentis over juveniles, which, Defendants \ncontend, heightens the Defendants' interest in locating weapons  or contraband concealed by \njuveniles being admitted to the JDC to protect the juvenile being searched and the other juveniles \nin custody. The Eleventh Circuit, however, specifically held that the security interests in performing \nstrip searches of juveniles and adults in custody is the same.  See Justice, 961 F.2d at 193.  Despite \nthe asserted distinction between searching adults and juveniles, the Court finds that there is at least \nbeen arrested for misdemeanor offenses was unconstitutional where jail authorities has no reasonable \nsuspicion that arrestee was concealing weapons or other contraband); Steward v.  Lubbock County, \nTexas, 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5\"' Cir. 1985) (strip search policy applied to minor offenders awaiting \nbond when no reasonable suspicion existed that they as a category of offenders or individually might \npossess weapons or contraband violated the Fourth Amendment); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F .2d 614, 615 \nth \n(9 Cir. 1984) (strip search ofp erson arrested for minor traffic offenses held unconstitutional in absence \nof individualized suspicion) (overruled on other grounds); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394-95 (loth \nCir. 1984) (held that routine strip searches in public area of persons detained for minOT traffic offenses \nis unreasonable under Fourth Amendment); Mary Beth G. v. City o/Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7''' \nCir. 1983) (strip search of misdemeanor offenders who were not inherently dangerOlls and who were \nbeing detained only briefly while awaiting bond violated the Fourth Amendment); Logan v. Shealy, 660 \nF.2d 1007, 1013 (4th CiT. 1981) (strip search ofDWI arrestee was held unconstitutional).  Common \nsense should guide those regularly dealing with juveniles that juveniles surely should not be treated \nmore harshly than adults. \n11 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 12 of 13 PageID #: 1119\n\"some,  but  not  precise  factual  correspondence\"  between Jones  and  tbis  case  and  that  the \nunlawfulness of the JDC's blanket strip search policy was apparent.  J.H.H., 878 F.2d at 243. \nMoreover, from the \"general, well-developed legal principles,\" id., involving strip searches \nof persons arrested for minor offenses in the absence of individualized suspicion established by the \nall ofthe courts of appeals' decisions examined in the Court's decision on the summary judgment \nmotions, a reasonable official would understand that the mc's blanket strip search policy applied \nto juveniles arrested for minor or non-felony offenses violates those juveniles' Fourth Amendment \nrights. \nOther than the Second Circuit's 2004 decision, the Defendants cannot cite to any case law \nwith \"some, but not precise factual correspondence\" with the present case that holds a blanket strip \nsearch policy similar to the mc policy at issue here is constitutional.  In its 2004 decision, the \nSecond Circuit acknowledged that it was not aware of an appellate ruling on the reasonableness of \nstrip searches of juveniles in lawful state custody, in the absence of individualized suspicion of \npossession of contraband.  N. G. v.  Connecticut, 382 F.3d at 233 (emphasis added).  Likewise, the \nCourt is unaware of any circuit ruling, prior to the issuance of the Second Circuit's opinion, finding \nconstitutional a strip search of ajuvenile admitted to ajuvenile detention facility who was arrested \nfor minor or non-felony offenses in the absence ofi ndividualized suspicion ofp ossession ofw  eapons \nor other contraband. \nThe Court concludes that, having reexamined the grounds for denying qualified immunity \nin the initial decision, even in light of the decision in N. G. v. Connecticut, Defendants Banbury and \nCheever are not entitled to qualified immunity in this action. In light oft he Eighth Circuit's decision \nin Jones, 770 F.2d at 742, the Eleventh Circuit's decision injustice, 961 F.2d at 193, the eight other \ncourts of appeals decisions cited by the Court in footnote 1, and the lack of an appellate ruling that \na strip search of a juvenile in lawful state custody in the absence of individualized suspicion of \npossession of a weapon or other contraband until 2004, the  Court finds  the law was clearly \nestablished beginning in 1986 that mc's policy of strip searching juveniles arrested for minor or \n12 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 140    Filed 01/20/05   Page 13 of 13 PageID #: 1120\nnon-felony offenses, without any individualized suspicion of possession of weapons or other \ncontraband, violated such juveniles Fourth Amendment rights.  See Jones, 770 F.2d at 742 n.4 \n(denying qualified immunity to jail officials who conducted a strip search in 1981  on a person \narrested for minor offenses without any suspicion that he was harboring weapons or contraband and \nholding that \"the fourth amendment's protection against the kind ofs earch ofw  hich Jones complains \nwas well-established at the time his search took place.\"). Based upon the Court's discussion above, \nit cannot be said that Defendants Banbury's and Cheever's actions '''could reasonably have been \nthought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.'\"  Gregoire v. Class, 236 F.3d \n413,417 (8th Cir. 2000) (quoting Anderson, 483 U.S. at 638). The Court has considered the Motion \nto Reconsider on the issue ofq ualified immunity. Upon reconsideration, qualified immunity is again \ndenied.  Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED: \n(I)  That the Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration, Doc. 129, is granted to the \nextent that the Court has reconsidered its ruling on the summary judgment \nmotions as set forth in the Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order, Doc. \n116, as to Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim and the qualified immunity \nissue, and the Motion for Reconsideration is denied in all other respects. \n(2)  That after having considered Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration, Doc. \n129, the Court again: (a) holds that the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention \nCenter's blanket policy of strip searching minors arrested for minor or non \nfelony offenses, without any individualized determination of reasonable \nsuspicion that the individual was or is likely to be carrying or concealing \nweapons, drugs or other contraband, violates the Fourth Amendment; (b) \nholds that the strip search of Plaintiff, Jodie Smook, violated her Fourth \nAmendment rights; and (c) denies qualified immunity to Defendants Jim \nBanbury and Todd Cheever on Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim. \n:(\\. \nDated this Z19(iay of January, 2005. \n0 \nY THE COURT: \nU UN \"'----,) \n~ \nrenee 1.

The Court previously certified two \nclasses.  Before the class notices were mailed, however,  Plaintiff moved to  amend the class \ndefinitions to include a significant additional number ofc lass members. Pursuant to an oral direction \nofthe Court, Plaintiff s counsel did not mail the class notices as previously ordered. For the reasons \nset forth below, the motion will be granted in part and denied in part. \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiff filed this action on November 1,2000 alleging that her civil rights were violated at \nthe Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center (\"JDC\"), in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. According \nto the Complaint, Plaintiff and three ofh er friends were arrested by Sioux Falls policemen for curfew \nviolations on August 8, 1999. The four teenagers were taken to the JDC where, allegedly, they were \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 327\nquestioned about their religious beliefs and practices, individually ordered into a bathroom, and strip \nsearched. According to the Complaint, the mc had a policy of conducting strip searches ofm  inors, \neven without probable cause to believe that the minors had weapons or contraband, as well as a \npolicy of questioning juvenile detainees about their religious beliefs and practices. \nIn the Complaint, Plaintiff alleged that the requirements for a class action were satisfied. The \ndefinition of the class Plaintiff originally sought to certifY was \"all minors who were charged with \nminor offenses and were, pursuant to mc policy, strip searched and/or subjected to questioning \nabout their religious beliefs at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center between November \n1,1997 and November 1, 2000.\" (Motion for Class Certification, Doc. 25, June 4, 2001.) Following \nthe resolution of a discovery dispute, Plaintiff submitted a Supplement in Support of Motion for \nClass Certification (Doc. 39) on October 18,2001, proposing that two separate classes be certified \nbased on the different life-span of the two allegedly nnconstitutional policies.  The first proposed \nclass was defined as: \"all minors who were charged with minor offenses and were, pursuant to JDC \npolicy, strip searched at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center between November 1, \n1997 and November 1, 2000.\"  (Doc. 39.)  The second proposed class was defined as: \"all minors \nwho were charged with minor offenses and were, pursuant to JDC policy, subjected to questioning \nabout private matters, including but not limited to  questions about their religious beliefs and \npractices, at the Miunehaha County Juvenile Detention Center between November 1, 1997 and \nNovember 1,2000.\" (Id.) The phrase \"minor offenses\" proposed by plaintiff was defined as \"petty \ntheft, liquor violations, being a runaway and curfew violations.\"  (Id.) \nOn March 20, 2002, the Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs reqnest for class \ncertification. (Memorandum Opinion and Order, Doc. 42.) The Court certified two classes, but did \nso on a basis different than that proposed by Plaintiff.  The first class certified by the Court was \ndefined as \"all persons seeking injunctive relief in this action who, when they under the age of \neighteen years old, were charged with minor offenses and were, pursuant to  JDC policy, strip \nsearched and/or SUbjected to questioning about their religious beliefs at the Minnehaha County \nJuvenile Detention Center from June 1, 1999 through September 14, 1999.\" (Id.) The second class \n2 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 3 of 16 PageID #: 328\ncertified by the Court was defined as \"al! persons seeking compensatory and/or punitive damages \nin this action who, when they under the age of eighteen years old, were charged with minor offenses \nand were, pursuant to JDC policy, strip searched andlor subjected to questioning about theirreligious \nbeliefs at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center from June 1, 1999 through September \n14, 1999.\" (Id.) Thus, the time period for both classes is from June 1, 1999 through September 14, \n1999. As requested by Plaintiff, the term \"minor offenses\" was defined as \"petty theft, liquor \nviolations, being a runaway and curfew violations.\"  (Id.) \nAt the time the class certification motion was decided the Court noted that \"[tJ he infonnation \npresented in connection with the Motion for Class Certification only supports classes of persons \nwho, as minors, were taken into the custody of the mc from June 1, 1999 through September 14, \n1999.\" (Doc. 42.) It was recognized that the record as it existed in March 2002, did not support the \nlengthy time frame suggested by Plaintiff. (kt) The Conrt further stated \"[bJ ut subsequent discovery \nmay establish a basis for expanding the class period.\"  (Id.) \nOn November 19,2002, Plaintiffm  oved to expand the class definition and postpone the class \nexclusion date.  (Doc.  67.)  After reviewing discovery materials, Plaintiff believed the class \ndefinition of \"minor offenses\" was too narrow and asked that the Court include the fol!owing \noffenses as minor offenses: \"petty theft, liquor violations, being a runaway, curfew violations, \nunamenable, truancy, underage consumption, window peeking, misuse of phone, tobacco, driving \nwhile revoked, contempt of court-CHINS, contempt of court-delinquent, disturbance of school, \ndamage to private property, damage to public property, false impersonation, delinquent probation \nviolation, delinquent violation court order, CHINS probation violation, CHINS violation conrt order, \nunlawful occupancy, failure to appear, and disorderly conduct.\"  (Doc. 67.)  In her reply brief \nregarding the motion to expand the class definition, Plaintiff stated that depositions were scheduled \nfor January 9 and 10, 2003 and she requested that she be allowed to file a supplemental reply brief \nfourteen days after those depositions to submit a proposed amended definition of minor offenses. \n(Doc. 70.)  On January 14, 2003, the Court denied Plaintiffs request to expand the class definition \nof minor offenses without prejUdice to her right to submit an amended proposed definition of minor \n3 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 329\noffenses on or before January 24, 2003, following the depositions to be taken in January.  (Order, \nDoc. 71.) \nOn January 24, 2003, Plaintiff filed a second Motion to Amend Class Definition, Doc. 72, \nseeking to expand the class by defining it as follows: \nAll individuals who, when under the age of eighteen years old, were arrested for or \ncharged with non-felony offenses, and were strip searched at the Minnehaha County \nJuvenile  Detention  Center  without  particularized  reasonable  suspicion  from \nNovember I, [1997]1 through the present andJorwere subjected to questioning about \ntheir religious beliefs at the Juvenile Detention Center from November 1, [1997]2 \nthrough September 14, 1999. \nPlaintiff states that after the depositions of the current and fonner directors of thc IDC, two fonner \nIDC staff members, the current assistant director of the IDC and the arresting Sioux Falls police \nofficer, \"plaintiffs discovered that the strip search and religious questioning policies were broader \nin scope both in tenns of time frame and the number of juveniles who were subjected to such \npolicies.\" (Doc. 72.) In the present motion, Plaintiffproposes that the phrase \"non-felony offenses\" \nreplace the phrase \"minor offenses\" in the classes previously certified by the Court.  The Court \nassumes Plaintiffintends to use the definition of \"non-felony offenses\" that was originallyproposed \nin her November 19, 2002 Motion to Expand Class Definition, Doc. 67. \nIn support of her motion, Plaintiff contends that beginning at some point before November \n1, 19973 and continuing until September 14, 1999, the IDC had a blanket policy to admit and strip \nsearch all juveniles who were brought to the IDC for any reason, without any individualized \nlWhile Plaintiffs motion to amend, Doc. 72, refers to the beginning of the class period as \nNovember 1, 1998, in her reply brief, Plaintiff clarifies that the beginning of the class period should be \nNovember I, 1997.  (Reply Brief, Doc. 76, p. 4, n.!.)  The parties agree that the statute oflimitations \nis three years pursuant to SDCL ยง 15-2-15.2.  The complaint was filed on November I, 2000.  Thus, \nthe Court will consider the motion to amend with a beginning date of the class period being November \n1,1997. \n'See note 1, supra. \n'See note 1, supra. \n4 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 330\ndetermination of probable cause.  The mc policy was changed as of September 14, 1999, in two \nrespects.  The first change was to install screens in the shower area to block from view the mid \nsections of juveniles while they were taking showers.  A visual search of the juvenile's body was \nconducted before and after the shower.  The second change applied to minors detained for certain \nminor offenses such as curfew, petty theft and liquor violations. If those minors were not admitted \nto the mc, they would not be strip-searched and required to shower.  If they were admitted, \nhowever, they were strip-searched and required to shower in the same fashion as all other minors. \nDue to the passage of a state law, the mc changed its policy again at some time in the year 2000 to \nprohibit juveniles from being strip-searched if they were detained solely for a curfew violation, \nunless there was probable cause to do so.  See SDCL ยง 26-11-1.1. \nPlaintiff further contends that the depositions in January 2003 revealed that the mc' s blanket \nstrip search policy was in effect for years prior to June 1, 1999, the date Plaintiff originally believed \nwas the effective date of the policy.  Rather than the policy being adopted in June 1999, Plaintiff \nasserts that Defendant James Banbury, former Director of the JDC, issued a directive in June 1999 \nto require JDC staff to adhere to the policy of strip searching all juveniles admitted to the mc, \nwhich policy was already in effect but not being followed by the mc staff at that time.  It is \nPlaintiff's assertion that the mc currently continues to strip search all juveniles who are admitted \nto the mc, without an individualized determination of probable cause and without considering the \nseverity of the charged offense, in violation of juveniles' Fourth Amendment rights. \nRegarding the policy of questioning juveniles about their religious preference, Plaintiff \ncontends Banbury testified that policy has been in effect since the JDC was opened over 30 years \nago.  Thus, Plaintiff seeks to expand the certified class to those juveniles who were subjected to \nreligious questioning from November 1, 19974 to September 14,1999, the date the JDC ceased such \nquestioning. \n'See note 1, supra. \n5 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 331\nDefendants oppose the motion to expand the classes based upon statute of limitations \ngrounds.  They concede that the statute of limitations was tolled on behalf of all putative members \nof the class as originally proposed by Plaintiff until class certification was denied.  The statute of \nlimitations, however, is not tolled for any potential class members not included in the original \nproposed class definition, which was limited in part to minors that were charged with minor offenses. \nThe definition of \"minor offenses\" only included petty theft, liquor violations, being a runaway and \n5 \ncurfew violations. Moreover, Defendants contend that the statute of limitations was tolled for \nputative class members only until the Court ruled on the motion for class certification, which was \nissued on March 20, 2002.  Once the class certification decision was issued, argue Defendants, the \nstatute oflimitations began to run again as to claims by all of the putative class members who were \nnot included in the certified class. In addition, Defendants contend that the Plaintiff s current motion \nto expand the class does not have the same tolling effect as the original motion to certify a class. \nThus, according to Defendants, the statute oflimitations bars any claims that accrued more than three \nyears prior to the date upon which this Court may grant Plaintiff s pending motion to expand the \nclass. \nIn response to Defendants' opposition, Plaintiff contends that the Court's March 20, 2002 \nclass certification order was merely preliminary and, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(c)(I), the order was conditional and could be altered or amended before the decision on the \nmerits.  Affirmative defenses, such as the statute of limitations, are not to be considered when \ndeciding the issue of class certification. Even ift he Court were to consider the statute oflimitations' \nissue, Plaintiffa sserts that none 0 fthe claims ofthe members of the proposed amended class is time-\n5The Plaintiffs contend in their reply brief, Doc. 76, that the Defendants do not argue that the \ncomplaint does not cover juveniles charged with \"non-felony offenses\" as  included in the proposed \namended class definition and that even if they did, the Complaint's reference to \"minor offenses\" \nreasonably includes \"non-felony offenses.\"  Contrary to Plaintiffs' characterization of Defendants' \nargument, Defendants do argue in their opposition brief that if one \"erroneously assumed\" that the \nphrase \"minor offenses\" in the complaint \"somehow encompassed the phrase 'all non-felony offenses,'\" \nsuch that the statute oflimitations would be tolled for all non-felony offenses from the filing of the \nComplaint, the clock started ticking again when Plaintiffs filed the motion for class certification \nspecifically defining \"minor offenses\" to include the specific offenses of petty theft, liquor violations, \nbeing a runaway and curfew violations.  (Defendants' Opposition Brief, Doc. 75, at 5.) \n6 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 332\nbarred because the Court did not deny class certification and it only preliminarily defined the class. \nThe \"no piggyback\" rule cited by Defendants is a red-herring, asserts Plaintiff, because Plaintiff is \nnot attempting to file a second class action for which class certification has been denied in a prior \naction.  Plaintiff further argues that even if the Defendants' arguments are accepted, the statute of \nlimitations would have been tolled from November 1,2000 (filing of the Complaint) to March 20, \n2002 (Certification Order), for a total of505 days and the time frame ofthe previously defined class \nwould be timely if they accrued on or after September 6,1998. \nDECISION \nSouth Dakota's statute oflimitations applies in this ยง 1983 action. See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 \nU.S. 261, 268 (1985) (explaining that federal courts apply the most analogous state statute of \nlimitations to determine the statutory period for bringing a ยง 1983 action). The law in South Dakota \nis that \"[al ny action brought under the federal civil rights statute may be commenced only within \nthree years after the alleged constitutional deprivation has occurred.\"  SDCL ยง 15-2-15.2.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs claims, and those of the class members, are subject to a three-year limitations period. \"It \nis axiomatic that no class action may proceed on behalf of class members whose claims are barred \nby the applicable statute oflimitations.\" Schmidt v. Interstate Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass'n, 74 F.R.D. \n423,428 (D.D.C. 1977).  Thus, \"the applicable statute oflimitations marks the outer boundary for \nclass membership.\" Id. \nPlaintiff contends that the Court should not evaluate the statute of limitations issue as it \nrelates to potential class members at the time it considers class certification.  The cases cited by \nPlaintiff for this proposition are Eisen v.  Carlisle &  Jacquelin, 417 U.S.  156, 177-78 (1974), \nInternational Woodworkers ofA  m. v. Chesapeake BayPlvwood Com., 659F.2d 1259, 1270 (4thCir. \n1981), and Healy v. Loeb Rhoades & Co., 99 F.R.D. 540, 543 (N.D. Ill. 1983).  These cases are \ndistinguishable from the present case.  The Eisen court held that a court may not evaluate the merits \nof a suit to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.  417 U.S. at 177.  That case \ndid not, however, address the situation of considering statute oflimitations in defining the class. In \nInternational Woodworkers, the court noted that in determining whether a class should be certified, \n7 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 333\nthe district court generally refuses to consider the impact of a statute ofiimitations' defense as to the \n\"potential representative's case.\"  659 F.2d at 1270.  Considering the merits of the potential \nrepresentative's case is wholly different from determining the proper time period for defining the \nclass.  See  Schmidt, 74 F.R.D. at 428 (explaining that \"the applicable statute of limitations marks \nthe outer boundary for class membership. \"). The remaining case, Healy, does not support Plaintiff s \nclaim because that court specifically noted that the defendants did not argue that the limitation \nperiods were relevant to establishing a cut-off date for class membership.  99 F.R.D. at 543. In this \ncase, Defendants have asserted that the statute of limitations does set a cut-off date for class \nmembership.  Thus,  the Court must consider the  statute of limitations  as  it relates  to  class \nmembership. \nThere are two separate, but interrelated, issues in the Plaintiff s request to expand the class \ndefinition.  The first issue is whether the current time-frame ofJune 1, 1999 through September 14, \n1999, should be expanded to November 1,  1997 through the present for strip searching and to \nNovember 1, 1997 to September 14, 1999 for religious questioning.  The second issue is whether \nthe class should be expanded from minors charged with \"minor offenses\" to minors charged with \n\"non-felony offenses.\" \nAddressing federal class action procedure, the Supreme Court held that \"the commencement \nof a class action suspends the applicable statute oflimitations as to all asserted members of the class \nwho would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.\" American \nPipe and Const. Co v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 554 (1974); See Crown, Cork & Seal Co., Inc. v. Parker, \n462 U.S.  345,  353-54 (1983)  (explaining that the  statute of limitations  is  tolled until  class \ncertification is denied and \"[ a]t that point, class members may choose to file their own suits or to \nintervene as plaintiffs in the pending action.\").  One of the primary reasons for tolling the statute of \nlimitations is that without the rule, \"[p ]otential class members would be induced to file protective \nmotions to intervene or to join in the event that a class was later found unsuitable.\" American Pipe, \n414 U.S.  at 553.  The tolling rule is consistent with the purpose ofa statute oflimitations because \nthe commencement of the purported class action notifies the defendants of both the substantive \n8 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 334\nclaims and also the approximate number and general identities of the potential plaintiffs asserting \nthose claims.  See id.  at 554-56.  The limitations period is tolled during the entire time the \n\"individual may have been embraced within the not-yet-certified class.\"  Ganousis v. E.1- du Pont \nde Nemours & Co., 803 F.Supp. 149, 154 (N.D. Ill. 1992) (emphasis in original). \nIf a definitive decision is made denying class certification to some or all of the class \nmembers, the statute oflimitations begins to run again as to those members not certified. See Crown \n& Cork, 462 U.S. at 354.  Federal courts have an option, however, to make a preliminary ruling on \nclass certification that allows for amendment oft hat ruling if subsequent discovery demonstrates the \nclass should be defined differently than the preliminary definition.  See Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 23(c)(1). \nRule 23(c  )(1) provides that a ruling on a class certification \"may be conditional, and may be altered \nor amended before the decision on the merits.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P.23(c)(1). \nIt is clear based upon the American Pipe tolling rule, that the three-year statute oflimitations \nwas tolled beginning on November 1, 2000 for any claims that accrued as 0 fNovember 1, 1997. The \nquestion then becomes whether that tolling ended when the Court issued its ruling on class \ncertification limiting the class period to June 1, 1999 through September 14, 1999. Ifthe statute of \nlimitations continued to be tolled following the Court's class certification ruling, the Court could \nexpand the class period if the record supported such an expansion. \nAt the time class certification was denied for the entire time period requested by Plaintiff, \nthe Court clearly stated the decision was not final and that discovery may provide a basis for \nexpanding the class.  (Order, Doc. 42.)  The Court's certification was thus conditional as provided \nby Rule 23( c )(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Genden v. Merrill Lvnch. Pierce, \nFenner &  Smith,  114 F.R.D. 48,  54 (S.D.N.Y.  1987) (holding that a certification ruling was \nconditional under Rule 23(c)(1) because the Court certifying the class expressed willingness to \nreconsider after merits discovery has been conducted). There was no definitive decision as to class \ncertification for the time period requested by Plaintiff. Because the certification ruling was not \ndefinitive or final, the Court does not find that the tolling of the statute oflimitations ended as to the \n9 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 335\npurported class when the Court issued its certification ruling on March 20, 2002.  Thus, there is no \nstatute oflimitations bar to expanding the time-frame of the classes as certified on March 20, 2002. \nThe next question is whether the record supports expanding the class period.  As to the strip \nsearching policy, Plaintiff seeks to expand the class period to November 1, 1997 to the present. \nRegarding the policy of questioning minors about their religious views, Plaintiff seeks to expand the \nclass period to November 1, 1997 and ending on September 14,1999, when the practice ofreligious \nquestioning was terminated. \nThe policy in effect at the time Plaintiff was strip searched required that all juveniles who \nwere brought to the mc for any reason were to be admitted and strip searched. That policy changed \nsomewhat on September 14, 1999, as Plaintiff acknowledged in a reply brief on the certification \nissue.  (Reply Brief, Doc. 31, July 29,2001.) After September 14, 1999, and apparently continuing \ntoday, juveniles charged with minor offenses such as petty theft, liquor violations, runaways and \ncurfew violations are no longer immediately admitted to the JDC. Rather, such minors are subjected \nto an inventory search and held in a waiting area for two hours.  If, after two hours, the JDC staff is \nunable to contact the minor's parents or the parents refuse to pick up the minor, the minor is \nadmitted to the JDC and undergoes a strip search. Thus, ift he minor is not picked up from the mc, \nhe or she is subjected to the same strip searching policy in effect when Plaintiff was strip searched \nin August 1999. \nThe current beginning date for purposes of class membership is June 1, 1999, which is the \ndate Plaintiff originally believed the strip-searching policy began. After taking several depositions \nin January 2003, Plaintiff now contends that the policy of strip searching all juveniles was in effect \nfor years prior to June I, 1999.  It was in June 1999 that former mc Director Banbury issued a \ndirective instructing all staff to comply with the strip-searching policy as to all juveniles admitted \nto the JDC because Banbury had learned that the staff was not always complying with that policy. \nDefendants do not challenge Plaintiffs asse11ion that the strip-searching policy was in effect for \nyears prior to Jnne 1, 1999.  As explained above, there is no statute of limitations bar to expanding \n10 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 11 of 16 PageID #: 336\nthe class back to November I, 1997, three years prior to the filing of this action.  Thus, because the \nrecord now supports an earlier beginning date than currently certified, the beginning of the class \nperiod will be November I, 1997 as to the strip-searching policy. \nThe cut-off date for the classes currently certified is September 14, 1999, the date of the \npolicy change explained above.  The Defendants do  not provide a persuasive reason for not \nextending the class period to the present and to include future members as to the strip-searching \npolicy. After the policy change effective September 14, 1999,juveniles continue to be strip searched \nwithout probable cause upon their admission to the mc for non-felony charges. The primary change \nis that juveniles charged with the offenses of petty theft, liquor violations, being a runaway and \ncurfew violations are not strip searched if they are picked up by their parents within two hours of \nbeing taken to the mc.  In addition, at some point during the year 2000, the mc's policy was \nchanged again to comply with SDCL ยง 26-11-1.1, to prohibit, without probable cause, strip searches \nof juveniles admitted to the mc on the sole charge of a curfew violation.  The class period will \nextend to the present and will include future members. See Moore's Federal Practice ~ 23 .21 [2] (3d \ned. 2002) (explaining that \"a class may include future members as long as the court would be able \nto determine, at any given time, whether a particular individual is then a member ofthe class.\"). The \nCourt will establish a cut-off date as this litigation progresses. \nThe record now also demonstrates that the policy of questioning juveniles about their \nreligious beliefs was in effect for years prior to June I, 1999.  Thus, similar to the class period \nregarding the strip-searching policy, the classes involving minors subj ecting to questioning about \ntheir religious beliefs will be expanded to begin November 1, 1997. Contrary to the strip-searching \nclass, however, the class period for minors subjected to questioning about their religious beliefs will \nend on September 14, 1999, because Plaintiff continues to believe the policy ended on that date. \nThe second issue regarding class expansion relates to the definition of \"minor offenses\" and \nwhether the statute oflimitations was tolled for minors charged with offenses other than petty theft, \nliquor violations, being a runaway and curfew violations.  The Court finds  that the statute of \n11 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 12 of 16 PageID #: 337\nlimitations was tolled for certain periods oftime for minors charged with offenses other than \"minor \noffenses,\" as defined by Plaintiff in her Motion for Class Certification, Doc. 25, filed on June 4, \n2001. \nIn her Complaint filed November 1, 2000, Plaintiff sought to define the class members as \n\"others similarly situated who have been arrested for alleged violations of curfew laws or other \nminor offenses and detained at the Minnehaha County Detention Center and strip searched (Count \nI) and/or questioned about their religious beliefs or practices (Count II).\" (Complaint, Doc. 1, ,  8.) \nThe term \"other minor offenses\" was not defined in the Complaint. Rather, Plaintiff defined \"minor \noffenses\" in her Motion for Class Certification filed on June 4,  2001,  as  \"petty theft,  liquor \nviolations, being a mnaway and curfew violations.\" (Doc. 25.) This definition was adopted by the \nCourt in its initial class certification mling.  (Doc. 42.) \nAlthough the Court clearly stated in the class certification Order, Doc. 42, that Plaintiff could \nmove to expand the class based upon the class period, the Court did not indicate a willingness to \nexpand the class based upon the types of offenses for which the minors were charged.  Thus, the \nportion of the class certification mling based upon the types of offenses for which minors were \ncharged was not conditional under Rule 23(c)(I) and the statute oflimitations as to offenses other \nthan petty theft, liquor violations, being a mnaway and curfew violations was not tolled due to a \nconditional mling. \nMoreover, the tolling provision in American Pipe provides that the statute of limitations is \ntolled for \"all asserted members ofthe class who wonld have been parties had the suit been permitted \nto continue as a class action.\" 414 U.S. at 554 (emphasis added); see Crown & Cork, (reconfirming \nthat \"[0 ]nce the statute of limitations has been tolled, it remains tolled for all members of the \nputative class until class certification is denied.\").  It is possible that the entire list of offenses \ncurrently asserted by Plaintiff falls within the definition of \"other minor offenses\" as alleged in the \nComplaint, such that the statute oflimitations may have been tolled for the seven-month time period \nfrom the filing ofthe Complaint to the date the Motion for Class Certification Order, Doc. 25, was \n12 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 13 of 16 PageID #: 338\nfiled.  When the term \"minor offenses\" was defined in the class certification motion, however, that \ntolling would have ended and the statute oflimitations began to run again for those minors charged \nwith offenses other than \"petty theft, liquor violations, being a runaway and curfew violations.\" See \nGanousis, 803 F.Supp. at 154-56. \nThe Northern District of Illinois was faced with a situation similar to that posed by the \npresent case.  See id.  In Ganousis, the parties seeking to be included in the certified class arguably \nwere members of the putative class as set forth in the complaint, but were clearly excluded as class \nmembers based upon the class representative's definition of the putative class  filed after the \ncomplaint.  See id.  The Court concludes that similar to the parties seeking to be included in the \ncertified class in Ganousis, the American Pipe tolling halted as to any potential class members \ncharged with offenses other than petty theft, liquor violations, being a runaway and curfew violations \nwhen  Plaintiff filed  her  class  certification  motion  on  June  4,  2001.  The  tolling  arguably \nrecommenced when Plaintiff filed the initial Motion to Expand the Class on November 19, 2002 \n(Doc.  67) to include the other offenses, and continues to the present.  From June 4, 2001  to \nNovember 19, 2002,532 days elapsed. Thus, the appropriate class period for juveniles arrested for \nnon-felony offenses other than petty theft, liquor violations, being a runaway and curfew violation, \nand strip searched at the JDC begins 532 days after November I, 1997, which is April 16, 1999. As \nexplained above regarding expanding the class period, the class as to strip searching will continue \nto  the present and include future members.  Regarding the juveniles charged with non-felony \noffenses who were subjected to questioning about their religious beliefs, the beginning class period \nwill be April 16, 1999 and the cut-off date will be September 14, 1999, which is the date Plaintiff \nconcedes the JDC discontinued such questioning. \nAs explained in the Court's first certification ruling, there must be a certified class for the \nclaims involving compensatory damages that is separate from the claims involving injunctive relief. \nBecause there are now separate time periods for juveniles subjected to strip searching from those \nsubjected to religious questioning, additional classes must be certified. \n13 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 14 of 16 PageID #: 339\nCONCLUSION \nAs a result ofthe above rulings, four classes will be certified by the Court. There will be two \nclasses involving minors who were strip searched, one for injunctive reliefand one for compensatory \nand punitive damages.  Minors who were strip searched and were charged with the four minor \noffenses as  defined in the Court's prior certification order, which includes petty theft, liquor \nviolations, being a runaway and curfew violations, will be members of the classes if they were \ncharged from November 1, 1997 to a date in the future to be set by the Court.  The classes will also \ninclude minors who were strip searched from April 16, 1999 to a date in the future to be set by the \nCourt and were charged with non-felony offenses, which are defined as unamenable, truancy, \nwindow peeking, tobacco, driving while revoked, contempt of court-CHINS, contempt of court \ndelinquent, disturbance of school, damage to private property, damage to public property, false \nimpersonation, delinquent probation violation, delinquent violation court order, CHINS probation \nviolation, CHINS  violation court order,  unlawful occupancy, failure to appear and disorderly \nconduct.6 \nThere will be an additional two classes for those minors seeking injunctive relief and those \nseeking compensatory and punitive damages as a result of JDC's policy of questioning them about \ntheir religious beliefs.  The same definitions of offenses and beginning time periods will apply to \nthese classes as to the classes involving strip searching described above, but the ending date for the \nclasses will be September 14,1999.  Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED: \n1.  That the Plaintiff s Motion to Amend Class Definition, Doc. 72, is granted \nin part and denied in part as explained in this Order. \n'The definition of non-felony offenses will not include \"misuse of phone\" as requested by \nPlaintiffbecause there has been no showing that misuse ofp hone is an offense for which a minor would \nbe taken to the JDC and subjected to the strip searching policy at issue in this case.  Rather misuse of \nphone appears to be a violation of the JOe's internal rules for which a minor would be punished after \nadmission to the JDC and being subjected to the strip searching policy.  Thus, a minor accused of \nmisuse of phone is not similarly situated to the Plaintiff in this action. \n14 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 15 of 16 PageID #: 340\n2.  That, pursuant to F ederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (b )(2), a class is certified \nof all persons seeking injunctive relief in this action who, when they under \nthe age of eighteen years, were charged with minor offenses from November \n1, 1997 to a date to be set by the Court or were charged with non-felony \noffenses from April 16, 1999 to a date to be set by the Court, and were, \npursuant to mc policy, strip searched at the Minnehaha County Juvenile \nDetention Center. \n3.  That, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), a second class is \ncertified of all persons seeking compensatory and punitive damages in this \naction who, when they under the age of eighteen years, were charged with \nminor offenses from November 1, 1997 to a date to be set by the Court or \nwere charged with non-felony offenses from April 16, 1999 to a date to be set \nby the  Court,  and were,  pursuant to  mc policy,  strip  searched at the \nMinnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. \n4.  That, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), a third class is \ncertified of all persons seeking injunctive reliefin this action who, when they \nunder the age of eighteen years, were charged with minor offenses from \nNovember 1,1997 to September 14,1999, or were charged with non-felony \noffenses from April 16, 1999 to September 14, 1999, and were, pursuant to \nJDC policy, subjected to  questioning about their religious beliefs at the \nMinnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. \n5.  That, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), a fourth class is \ncertified of all persons seeking compensatory and punitive damages in this \naction who, when they under the age of eighteen years, were charged with \nminor offenses from November 1,  1997 to  September 14, 1999 or were \ncharged with non-felony offenses from April 16, 1999 to September 14, \n1999, and were, pursuant to mc policy, subj ected to questioning about their \nreligious beliefs at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. \n6.  That the term \"minor offenses\" in all four certified classes includes the \noffenses  of petty theft,  liquor violations,  being  a  runaway and  curfew \nviolations.  The term \"non-felony offenses\" in all four certified classes \nincludes the offenses of unamenable, truancy, window peeking, tobacco, \ndriving  while  revoked,  contempt  of court-CHINS,  contempt of court \ndelinquent, disturbance of school, damage to private property, damage to \npublic  property,  false  impersonation,  delinquent  probation  violation, \ndelinquent  violation  court  order,  CHINS  probation  violation,  CHINS \nviolation court order, unlawful occupancy, failure to appear and disorderly \nconduct. \n15 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 78    Filed 06/06/03   Page 16 of 16 PageID #: 341\n7.  That  the  parties  proceed  diligently  and  expeditiously  to  conduct  any \nadditional discovery that must be completed due to the expansion ofthe time \nperiod of the classes and the inclusion of additional offenses, with all such \ndiscovery to be completed on or before October 21,2003. \n8.

INTRODUCTION\nSubject to approval by the United States District Court for the District of South\nDakota, this Settlement Agreement sets forth the full and final terms by which the Named\nPlaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and members of the Settlement Class defined herein,\nand defendant Minnehaha County have settled and resolved all claims that have been\nraised in the Complaint (filed in November 2000) and the proposed Amended Complaint\n(filed in June 2007).\nII.  NATURE AND RESOLUTION OF THE CASE\nA.  In November 2000, former class representative Jodie Smook filed a\nComplaint on behalf of herself and a class of individuals who had been arrested for\nalleged violations of curfew laws or other minor offenses and detained at the Minnehaha\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 192-2    Filed 08/03/09   Page 3 of 19 PageID #: 1434\nCounty Juvenile Detention Center (\"JDC\") and strip searched and/or questioned about\ntheir religious beliefs and practices.\nB.  On March 20, 2002, this Court certified this case pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(2) to proceed on behalf of \"all persons seeking injunctive relief in this action who,\nwhen they were under the age of eighteen years old, were charged with minor offenses\nand were, pursuant to JDC policy, strip searched and/or subjected to questioning about\ntheir religious beliefs at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center from June 1,\n1999 through September 14, 1999.\" This Court also certified a separate class pursuant to\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) of all persons who meet the above class definition who were\nseeking compensatory and/or punitive damages.\nC.  Following plaintiffs' motion to amend the class definition, on June 6, 2003,\nthis Court certified four classes comprised of all persons \"who, when they under the age\nof eighteen years, were charged with minor offenses from November 1, 1997 to a date to\nbe set by the court or were charged with non-felony offenses from April 16, 1999 to a\ndate to be set by the Court\" who were (1) strip searched at the JDC and were seeking\nmonetary damages; (2) strip searched at the JDC and were seeking injunctive relief; (3)\nsubjected to questioning about their religious beliefs and were seeking monetary\ndamages; and (4) subjected to questioning about their religious beliefs and were seeking\ninjunctive relief.1\n1  Minor and non-felony offenses include: absconder, bench warrants, child in need\nof supervision (\"CHINS\"), CHINS probation violation, CHINS violation court order, contempt\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 192-2    Filed 08/03/09   Page 4 of 19 PageID #: 1435\nD.  On September 27,2004, this Court ruled that the JDC's strip search policy\nviolated the Fourth Amendment.  Smook v. Minnehaha County, 340 F. Supp.2d 1037\n(D.S.D. 2004)(\"Smook /\").  This Court also held that plaintiffs' claim for declaratory\nrelief regarding JDC's policy of questioning minors being admitted to the JDC about their\nreligious preferences must be dismissed because defendants had discontinued the practice\nand plaintiffs had withdrawn their claim for monetary damages on that claim. Id. at 1049-\n1050.2  On August 9, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed this\nCourt's decision, holding that (1) plaintiffs Smook's strip search was reasonable under\nthe Fourth Amendment; (2) the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity;\nand (3) the class lacked standing to seek injunctive relief. Smook v. Minnehaha  County,\n457 F.3d 806 (8th Cir. 2006)(\"SmookIIF)?  On March 26, 2007, the Supreme Court\ndenied plaintiffs' petition for writ of certiorari.\nof court-CHINS, contempt of court-delinquent, court-ordered detained, court-ordered\ndisposition, curfew violations, damage to private property, damage to public property, delinquent\nprobation violation, delinquent violation court order, disorderly conduct, disturbance of school,\ndriving while revoked, failure to appear, false impersonation, juvenile arrest warrants, liquor\nviolations, petty theft, runaway, tobacco, truancy, unamenable, underage consumption, unlawful\noccupancy, and window peeking. In addition, individuals brought to the JDC as a courtesy hold,\nplacement contract, or placement contract with the Department of Corrections may qualify as\nclass members if their alleged underlying offense falls within the definition of minor or non-\nfelony offense.\n2  Minnehaha County requested that this Court reconsider its summary judgment\nruling based upon N.G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225 (2d Cir. 2004), which the Court denied on\nJanuary 20, 2005. Smook v. Minnehaha County, 353 F. Supp.2d 1059 (D.S.D. 2005)(\"Smook\n3  On September 27, 2006, the Eighth Circuit declined plaintiffs' petition for\nrehearing en bane.\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 192-2    Filed 08/03/09   Page 5 of 19 PageID #: 1436\nE.  Following the Eighth Circuit's ruling, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to\nsubstitute as class representatives Nicole Stauffacher, Jillian Clark, and Ross Engelbrecht\non behalf of a class seeking damages.  Each of the proposed class representatives was\nbrought to the JDC during the pertinent time period for a minor or non-felony offense and\neach of them was required to remove all of his or her clothing and subjected to a strip\nsearch by JDC personnel.\nF.  In an effort to determine whether the parties could settle this dispute prior to\nlitigating the case for a second time at the district and appellate courts, the parties'\ncounsel, all of whom are experienced class action attorneys, participated in extended\nnegotiations.  On February 4,2009, the parties participated in a mediation with Magistrate\nJudge Veronica Duffy, District of South Dakota.  During the mediation, counsel\nbargained vigorously on behalf of their clients.  All negotiations were conducted at arms'\nlength and in good faith.\nG.  All parties and their counsel recognize that, in the absence of an approved\nsettlement, they would face a long course of continued litigation, including another round\nof discovery, motions for summary judgment, and appellate proceedings that would\nconsume time and resources and present each of them with ongoing litigation risks and\nuncertainties.  The parties wish to avoid these risks and uncertainties, as well as the\nconsumption of time and resources, through settlement pursuant to the terms and\nconditions of this Settlement Agreement.  Class counsel believe that the terms of the\nSettlement Agreement are in the best interests of the Class and are fair, reasonable, and\n4\n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 192-2    Filed 08/03/09   Page 6 of 19 PageID #: 1437\nadequate, and Minnehaha County wishes to bring the litigation to a conclusion on the\nterms set forth in this Settlement Agreement.\nIH.

This action is brought pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \n(\"Section 1983\"), and the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution, seeking to redress the defendants' unlawful policy and practice of strip searching \nminors without probable cause and questioning them regarding their religious beliefs and \npractices. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343. \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 1    Filed 11/01/00   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 2\n- -\n3.  Venue is proper because all of the defendants reside or are located in the District \nof South Dakota, Southern Division and all of the conduct complained of occurred within this \nDistrict. \nPARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff Jodie Smook (\"Smook\") is a minor who resides with her parents, Vicky \nSmook and Randy Smook, in Luverne, Minnesota. \n5.  Defendant Minnehaha CollOty is and, at all times relevant to this cause of action, \nwas a political subdivision of the State of South Dakota that operates, manages, directs and \ncontrols the Minnehaha CollOty Juvenile Detention Center. \n6.  Defendant James Banbury, at a1l times relevant to this cause of action, was \nDirector of the Minnehaha CollOty Juvenile Detention Center who, upon information and belief, \nhad final authority to establish certain policies for the Detention Center including but not limited \nto policies concerning the strip searching and questioning of minors detained and/or arrested. \nBanbury is sued in his individual capacity for his llOlawful acts llOder color of law. \n7.  John and Jane Doe Detention Center Officers are the officers, employees and \nagents of the other defendants who conducted the unlawful strip search in the Minnehaha CollOty \nJuvenile Detention Center. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n8.  Smook brings this action in an individual capacity and as a representative of a1l \nothers similarly situated minors who have been arrested for alleged violations of curfew laws or \nother minor offenses and detained at the Minnehaha County Detention Center and strip searched \n(Count I) and/or questioned about their religious beliefs or practices (CollOt II). \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 1    Filed 11/01/00   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 3\n- -\n9.  The classes are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The \nclasses consists of all persons who have been i~ured in any way by the unconstitutional practices, \nacts and policies of the defendants and their agents.  On information and belief there are over one \nhundred persons in each class. \n10.  Questions of fact and/or law exist which are common to all members of the \nputative classes.  These questions include, but are not limited to: \na.  Whether the defendants' conduct was violative of the laws and protections \nof the United States of America and/or the State of South Dakota; \nb.  Whether the defendants' conduct is the subject of injunctive relief; and \nc.  What is the proper measure of damages and other remedies for the \ndefendants' violations of law. \nII.  The plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect and represent the interest of the \nclasses.  Plaintiff seeks no relief antagonistic or adverse to the members of either class.  Plaintiffs \nrights and damages suffered are typical of all members of each class.  The defendants have acted \nor have refused to act on grounds applicable to each entire class.  Plaintiff s counsel are able and \nexperienced in the prosecution of class actions. \n12.  A class action is the only appropriate method for the adjudication of this \ncontroversy.  Individual actions by individual members would create a risk of inconsistent results \nand would be unnecessary and duplicative of this litigation.  Such individual actions would work a \nhardship on each and every member of each class and the court system. \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \n13.  On August 8,1999, Smook, who was 16-years-old at the time, and three other \nminor female friends were detained by Sioux Falls Police after having car trouble.  It was after \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 1    Filed 11/01/00   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 4\n- -\n11 :00 p.m.,  which was the beginning of the curfew period for persons nnder the age of 18 in \nSioux Falls. \n14.  The police officers handcuffed Smook and the other young women and transported \nthem to the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. \n15.  At the Detention Center, Smook and the other girls were questioned about their \nreligious beliefs and practices, and ordered to answer those questions as part of the detention \nprocess. \n16.  After being questioned, the plaintiff and each of her three friends were individually \nordered into a bathroom and strip searched at the direction of the Juvenile Detention Center's \npersonnel. \n17.  The defendants did not have any lawful basis to inquire about detainees' religious \nbeliefs or practices or to strip search them and they acted pursuant to unconstitutional policies of \nthe Minnehaha Connty Juvenile Detention Center in doing so. \n18.  Plaintiff and the other girls were ultimately released to their parents and issued \ncitations for curfew violations. \n19.  On information and belief, Banbury, as Director of the Juvenile Detention Center, \nwas aware of andlor directed the nnconstitutional policies. \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 - Fourth Amendment \n20.  Smook incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 19. \n21.  The actions complained of in paragraphs 13  through 19 were done pursuant to an \nunlawful and unconstitutional policy or practice of conducting strip searches of minors brought to \nthe Juvenile Detention Center without probable cause to believe they had weapons or contraband. \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 1    Filed 11/01/00   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 5\n- -\n22.  The actions complained ofh ave caused Smook and the members oft he plaintiffclasses \nto be subjected to an tmreasonable search and seizure, deprived of  their liberty, embarrassed, \nhumiliated, subjected to extreme emotional distress, and deprived ofr ights secured by the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution ofthe United States. \nCOUNT II \n42 U.S.c. ยง 1983 - First Amendment \n23.  Smook incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs I through 19. \n24.  The actions complained of in paragraphs 13 through 19 were done pursuant to an \nunlawful and unconstitutional policy or practice ofq uestioning juvenile detainees about their religious \nbeliefs and practices. \n25.  The actions complained ofh ave caused Smook and the members oft he plaintiff classes \nto be subjected to an invasion of privacy and intimidation in the exercise of the rights to freedom of \nreligion and association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments oft he Constitution oft he United \nStates. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jodie Smook prays that this Court: \nA.  Enter judgment in favor of Smook and the plaintiff classes and against the defendants \nMinnehaha County, James Banbury, and John and Jane Does for violation of the Fourth, First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \nB.  Declare  that  the  actions  of the  defendants  alleged  this  complaint  were \nIII \nunconstitutional; \nC.  Enter a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering defendants to refrain from strip \nsearching juvenile detainees without probable cause to believe they have weapons or contraband; \n5 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 1    Filed 11/01/00   Page 6 of 6 PageID #: 6\n-\n-\nD.

Plaintiff Nicole Stauffacher is, and at all times pertinent hereto has been, a \nresident of South Dakota. \n4.  Plaintiff Jillian Clark is, and at all times pertinent hereto has been, a \nresident of Minnesota. \n5.  Plaintiff Ross Engelbrecht is, and at all times pertinent hereto has been, a \nresident of South Dakota. \n6.  Defendant Minnehaha County is and, at all times relevant to this cause of \naction, was a political subdivision of the State of South Dakota that operates, manages, \ndirects and controls the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n7.  Nicole Stauffacher, Jillian Clark, and Ross Engelbrecht bring this action in \ntheir individual capacities and as representatives of all other similarly situated individuals \nwho, when they were under the age of eighteen years old, were charged with minor or \nnon-felony offenses, and were, pursuant to Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center \n(\"JDC\") policy, strip searched at the JDC. \n8.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The \nclass consists of all persons who have been injured in any way by the unconstitutional \npractices, acts and policies of the defendant and its agents. \n9.  Questions of fact and/or law exist that are common to all members of the \nputative class.  These questions include, but are not limited to: \n2 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 165-2    Filed 06/08/07   Page 3 of 7 PageID #: 1233\na.  Whether the defendant's conduct was violative of the laws and \nprotections of the United States of America and/or the State of South \nDakota; \nb.  What is the proper measure of damages and other remedies for the \ndefendant's violations oflaw. \n10.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect and represent the \ninterest of the class.  Plaintiffs seek no relief antagonistic or adverse to the members of \nthe class.  Plaintiffs' rights and damages suffered are typical of all members of the class. \nThe defendant has acted or has refused to act on grounds applicable to the entire class. \nPlaintiffs' counsel are able and experienced in the prosecution of class actions. \nII.  A class action is the only appropriate method for the adjudication of this \ncontroversy.  Individual actions by individual members would create a risk of inconsistent \nresults and would be unnecessary and duplicative of this litigation.  Such individual \nactions would work a hardship on each and every member of the class and the court \nsystem. \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \nI 2.  A class action is the only appropriate method for the adjudication of this \ncontroversy.  Individual actions by individual members would create a risk of inconsistent \nresults and would be unnecessary and duplicative of this litigation.  Such individual \nactions would work a hardship on each and every member of the class and the court \nsystem. \n3 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 165-2    Filed 06/08/07   Page 4 of 7 PageID #: 1234\nNicole Stauffacher \n13.  On December 6, 1997, Nicole Stauffacher, who was thirteen (13) years old \nat the time, was detained by officers from the Sioux Falls Police Department after \nallegedly shoplifting.  She was with two adult friends of the family and their daughter at \nthe time of the incident. \n14.  The police officers handcuffed Stauffacher and transported her to the JDC. \n15.  At the JDC, Stauffacher was brought into a room with a shower, required to \nremove all of her clothing, and strip searched at the direction of the JDC's personnel. \n16.  Stauffacher was held at the JDC for a few hours and then released to her \nmother. \nJillian Clark \n17.  On August 30, 2000, Jillian Clark, who was seventeen (17) years old at the \ntime, was detained by officers of the Sioux Falls Police Department after allegedly \nshoplifting. \n18.  The police officers handcuffed Clark and transported her to the JDC. \n19.  At the JDC, Clark was brought into a holding room, required to remove all \nof her clothing, and strip searched at the direction of the JDC's personnel. \n20.  Clark was held at the JDC for a few hours and then released to her both of \nher parents. \n4 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 165-2    Filed 06/08/07   Page 5 of 7 PageID #: 1235\nRoss Engelbrecht \n21.  In or about December 2000, Ross Engelbrecht, who was seventeen (17) \nyears old at the time, was issued a ticket by officers of the Sioux Falls Police Department \nwhile he was in attendance at a party at which there was underage consumption of \nalcohol. \n22.  On December 19, 2000, when Engelbrecht appeared in court on the ticket, \nhe pleaded guilty to underage consumption, at which time the judge ordered him to \nimmediately serve two days at the JDC.  Police officers then handcuffed Engelbrecht and \ntransported him to the JDC. \n23.  At the JDC, Engelbrecht was brought into a room with showers, required to \nremove all of his clothing, and strip searched at the direction of the JDC's personnel. \n24.  Engelbrecht was held at the JDC for two days and then released to his \nmother. \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983- Fourth Amendment \n25.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 24. \n26.  The actions complained of in paragraphs 12 through 24 were done pursuant to \nan  unlawful  and  unconstitutional  policy  or  practice  of conducting  strip  searches  of \nindividuals under the age of eighteen years old who were brought to the JDC for minor or \nnon-felony offenses, without reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search. \n27.  The actions complained of have caused plaintiffs and the members of the \nplaintiff class to be subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure, deprived of their liberty, \n5 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 165-2    Filed 06/08/07   Page 6 of 7 PageID #: 1236\nembarrassed, humiliated, subjected to extreme emotional distress, and deprived of rights \nsecured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. \nPrayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request, on behalf of themselves and the class \nthey seek to represent, that this Court: \nA.

Following a discovery \ndispute, the Court granted plaintiffs motion to compel regarding other minors who were processed \nat the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center (\"JDC\") and subjected to a strip search and/or \nquestioning regarding their religious beliefs and practices.  (See Doc. 36.) Following the receipt of \nthe  pertinent lists,  plaintiff filed  a Supplement in  Support of Motion for  Class  Certification \n(\"Supplement\") (Doc. 39) and attached as Exhibits to the Supplement three lists ofm  inors processed \nat the JDC.  For the reasons stated below, the Motion for Class Certification will be granted. \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiff alleges that her civil rights were violated atthe JDC.  According to the Complaint, \nplaintiff and three of her friends were arrested by Sioux Falls policemen for curfew violations on \nAugust 8, 1999.  The four teenagers were taken to the JDC where, allegedly, they were questioned \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 42    Filed 03/20/02   Page 2 of 9 PageID #: 186\nabout their religious beliefs and practices, individually ordered into a bathroom, and strip searched. \nAccording to the Complaint, the JDC had a policy of conducting strip searches of minors, even \nwithout probable cause to believe that the minors had weapons or contraband, as well as a policy of \nquestioning juvenile detainees about the religious beliefs and practices.  Plaintiff alleges that more \nthan 100 minors were subjected to each ofthe JDC's policies, and seeks to certify a class consisting \nof \"all minors who were charged with minor offenses and were, pursuant to JDC policy, strip \nsearched and/or subjected to questioning about their religious beliefs at the Minnehaha County \nJuvenile Detention Center between November 1, 1997 and November 1,2000.\" \nIn the Supplement plaintiff proposes to certify two separate classes based on the defendants' \nassertion that the two policies at issue in this case had different life-spans.  The first proposed class \nwould be defined as: \"all minors who were charged with minor offenses and were, pursuant to JDC \npolicy, strip searched at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center between November 1, \n1997 and November 1,2000.\"  The second proposed class would be defined as: \"all minors who \nwere charged with minor offenses and were, pursuant to JDC policy, subjected to questioning about \nprivate matters, including but not limited to questions about their religious beliefs and practices, at \nthe Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center between November 1, 1997 and November 1, \n2000.\"  The phrase \"minor offenses\" proposed by plaintiff would include petty theft, liquor \nviolations, being a runaway and curfew violations. \nAccording to the defendants' Answers to Interrogatories, the policy under which plaintiffw  as \nsearched had been in effect since approximately June 1999.  Plaintiff appears to concede that the \npolicy began sometime in June 19991 and ended on September 14,  1999.  In an article dated \nSeptember 5, 1999, the Argus Leader reported that 234 juveniles were taken to the JDC for curfew \nviolations in 1998, and 210 were taken there from January through July of 1999. Despite publicity \nin the local newspaper and on local television news, only two other parents have contacted plaintiff s \nPlaintiffs Reply brief says that the policy was in effect \"[d]uring the summer of \n1999.\" (Reply at 1.)  Her own experience - being stopped in June 1999 but not being taken to the \nJDC - corroborates the defendant's assertion that the policy started sometime in June 1999. \n2 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 42    Filed 03/20/02   Page 3 of 9 PageID #: 187\nmother, Vickie Smook, about joining this lawsuit.  Some parents, the number of which is not \nspecified, have contacted plaintiffs counsel about joining the suit. \nDISCUSSION \nWhen properly maintained, a class action promotes judicial efficiency and, in addition, may \nprovide a remedy to persons for whom it would not be economically feasible to obtain relief \nindividually. See Deposit Guaranty Nat'} Bank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 339 (1980). To bring a class \naction  under  the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  a  plaintiff must  meet  both  the  general \nprerequisites for class actions in Rule 23(a) as well as the requirements for at least one of the \nparticular kinds oftransactions listed in Rule 23(b ).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Plaintiff seeks certification \nunder both Rule 23(b )(2) and Rule 23(b )(3).  \"Certification is not irreversible and may be altered or \namended as the case progresses towards resolution on the merits.\"  Cook v. Rockwell Int'! Corp., \n151 F.R.D. 378 (D. Colo. 1993). \nA.  Prerequisites \nRule 23(a) lists four prerequisites for the maintenance of a class action.  In particular, the \nRule provides: \nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on \nbehalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the \nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical ofthe claims or defenses \nof the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  These prerequisites are usually referred to as numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy of representation. \n1.  Numerosity \nPlaintiff has  shown that the  proposed class  is  sufficiently numerous  to  warrant class \ncertification. Although a lesser number can satisfy numerosity, a rule ofthumb is that a class of forty \nmembers satisfies the numerosity requirement. See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, \n47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995) (citing 1 Newberg on Class Actions 2d ยง 3.05 (1985)). Prior to the \n3 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 42    Filed 03/20/02   Page 4 of 9 PageID #: 188\nCourt's Order dated July 31,2001 granting plaintiffs motion to compel, the plaintiff relied on news \nreports to satisfy the numerosity requirement.  Pursuant to the Court's Order dated July 31,2001, \nhowever,  defendants  disclosed  a  list  of minors  that  plaintiff contends  shows  there  were \napproximately 300 curfew arrests processed at the JDC between June 1, 1999 and September 15, \n1999.  The Court reviewed the list attached as Exhibit A to plaintiffs Supplement.  Plaintiff \nrepresents that Exhibit A is a list of minors arrested for curfew violations. The list does not state that \nthe minors listed therein were arrested for curfew violations.  But defendants have not objected to \nplaintiff s characterization of the list and the Court will accept, for purposes of deciding the pending \nmotion, plaintiff s representation that Exhibit A represents minors arrested for curfew violations and \nprocessed at the JDC.  Having reviewed Exhibit A for the time period between June 1, 1999 and \nSeptember 15, 1999, the Court finds well over 200 minors were arrested for curfew violations. This \nnumber ofp otential class members is sufficient to satisfy numerosity. Moreover, plaintiff represents, \nwithout challenge by the defendants, that two additional lists attached to plaintiffs Supplement as \nExhibits C and D show that approximately 265 minors were processed during the pertinent time \nperiod for \"curfew and other violations\" and approximately 250 minors were processed during the \npertinent time period for \"offenses other than drug offenses, violent offenses or weapon offenses.\" \n2.  Commonality \nAlthough Rule 23(a) requires questions oflaw or fact common to the class, those questions \ndo not have to be identical as applied to each member of the class.  See Paxton v. Union National \nBank, 688 F.2d 552, 561 (8th Cir. 1982) (stating that \"the rule does not require that every question \nof law or fact be common to every member of the class).  Defendants suggest that plaintiffs \ntreatment was an isolated incident, because she has not produced testimony from additional persons \nclaiming to have been subjected to or similarly affected by the challenged policy. The plaintiffhas, \nhowever, produced a blank admission form apparently used by the JDC that includes spaces to write \ndown the detainee's \"religious preference\" and \"attendance,\" as well as spaces to inventory pants, \nshirts, socks, and \"briefs/panties.\" The admission form supports plaintiffs assertion that the JDC \nhad a policy of engaging in conduct that she claims is unconstitutional. Whether the conduct which \n4 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 42    Filed 03/20/02   Page 5 of 9 PageID #: 189\nresulted from the policy was in fact constitutional is a legal question that class members will have \ncommon. \nIn \n3.  Typicality \nAt this stage of the proceedings, plaintiff has also established typicality.  \"Typicality under \nRule 23(a)(3) means that there are other members of the class who have the same or similar \ngrievances as the plaintiff.\"  Alpern v. Utilicorp United, Inc., 84 F.3d 1525, 1540 (8th Cir. 1996) \n(quotation marks and citation omitted). Variations in the facts underlying the claims of the plaintiff \nand the potential class members will not preclude class certification if the plaintiff's claims arise \nfrom the same event or course of conduct as the class claims, and give rise to the same legal or \nremedial theories. See id. In this case, all ofthe members ofthe putative class, including the named \nplaintiff, were allegedly subject to the same policy administered by the JDe.  There is nothing \natypical about plaintiff's claim that would prevent class certification. \n4.  Adequacy of Representation \nThe plaintiff is also an adequate representative for the class.  \"The focus of Rule 23(a)(4) is \nwhether: (1) the class representatives have common interests with the members of the class, and (2) \nwhether the class representatives will vigorously prosecute the interests ofthe class through qualified \ncounsel.\"  Paxton, 688 F.2d at 562-63.  Defendants do not argue that plaintiff cannot adequately \nrepresent the class.  There is no indication that plaintiff's interests are antagonistic to the interests \nof other class members, or that she will not vigorously promote the interests of the class. \nB.  Certification under Rule 23(b)(2) \nThis case meets the requirements for certification under Rule 23(b )(2).  As a general rule, \n\"[ c ]ertification is appropriate under subsection (b )(2) if classwide injunctive relief is sought when \nthe defendant 'has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class. '\"  DeBoer v. \nMellon Mort. Co., 64 F.3d 1171, 1175 (8th Cir. 1995) (quoting Rule 23(b)(2ยป. Defendants oppose \ncertification under Rule 23(b )(2) on the grounds that they stopped implementing the challenged \npolicy in September 1999, before this lawsuit was ever filed. On this argument, however, defendants \n5 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 42    Filed 03/20/02   Page 6 of 9 PageID #: 190\n\"bear the fonnidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior \ncould not reasonably be expected to recur.\" See Friends ofthe Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental \nServices (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167,190 (2000).  Although the defendants may eventually be able \nto meet this burden, the facts are not sufficiently developed to make a final decision on injunctive \nrelief. At this point, defendants' voluntary decision to stop implementing the policy does not prevent \nthe certification of a class under Rule 23(b )(2). \nC.  Certification Under Rule 23(b)(3) \nA class may also be certified under Rule 23(b )(3). This provision pennits certification if\"the \nquestions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions \naffecting only individual members,\" and \"a class action is superior to other available methods for \nthe fair and efficient adjudication ofthe controversy.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  Defendants do not \ncontest that common questions of fact - what the JDC's policy was - and common questions oflaw \n- whether the policy was constitutional - predominate in this case.  They suggest that a class action \nis not a superior vehicle for the litigation, because no additional plaintiffs or potential plaintiffs have \ncome forward  to  litigate these issues.  The absence of additional plaintiffs suggests that the \nindividual stakes are too low for many plaintiffs to come forward on their own, and thus that there \nis a strong interest in having the common issues detennined in a class action. See Charles A. Wright, \nArthur R. Miller, Mary K. Kane, Federal Civil Practice & Procedure, ยง 1780 at 536-65 (2d ed. 1986). \nA class will also be certified under Rule 23(b)(3). \nD.  Problems of Certification Under Both Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3) \nWhen a class is certified under both Rule 23(b )(2) and Rule 23(b )(3), there is a danger that \nclass members who opt out of the class will bring separate actions seeking injunctive relief that is \ndifferent than the injunctive relief awarded in the class action.  See DeBoer, 64 F.3d at 1775.  To \nprevent this problem, the Eighth Circuit has previously upheld a district court's decision not to \ncertify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), which penn its class members to opt out, when a class could be \ncertified under Rule 23(b )(2), which does not pennit opting out. Id. That approach, however, is also \nproblematic, because it may prevent class members who are entitled to seek money damages from \n6 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 42    Filed 03/20/02   Page 7 of 9 PageID #: 191\nreceiving personal notice and an opportunity to opt out.  See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. \n815, 845-46 (1999) (emphasizing the importance of these rights). \nA better solution to the problem is divided certification.  Under this approach, the district \ncourt certifies the injunctive aspects of a suit under Rule 23(b )(2) and the damages aspects under \nRule 23(b)(3).  See Jefferson v. Ingersoll Int'l, Inc., 195 F.3d 894,898 (7th Cir. 1999) (suggesting \nthis method to the district court on remand); Lemon v. International Union of Operating Engineers, \n216 F.3d 577 (7th Cir. 2000) (suggesting three options for class certification where both injunctive \nand monetary relief is sought by plaintiff).  The injunctive relief, if any, that is awarded, binds all \nmembers of the class, while individual members who opt out are free to pursue their own claims for \ndamages.  Because the money damages sought in this case are not merely incidental, see Allison v. \nCitgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d402, 411-16 (5th CiT. 1998), and because this method ofb ifurcation \nfurthers the purposes of both Rule 23(b )(2) and Rule 23(b )(3), the Court will certify a separate class \nfor injunctive relief and a separate class for money damages.  Of course, the membership in these \nclasses will, at the outset, be identical.  It will change if individual class members exercise their \nrights to opt out. \nE.  Scope of the Classes \nThe information presented so far does not support as broad a class as plaintiff seeks to have \ncertified.  The class proposed by plaintiff would include minors taken into the custody of the JDC \nbetween November 1, 1997 and November 1, 2000. The information presented in connection with \nthe Motion for Class Certification only supports classes of persons who, as minors, were taken into \nthe custody of the JDC from June 1,1999 through September 14,1999. Although it appears that the \nJDC policy regarding religious beliefs' questioning may have been in existence for a longer period \nof time than the strip searching policy, the record at this point does not support the lengthy time \nframe suggested by plaintiff. But subsequent discovery may establish a basis for expanding the class \nperiod. \n7 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 42    Filed 03/20/02   Page 8 of 9 PageID #: 192\nCONCLUSION \nThe evidence before the Court supports the certification oftwo classes of plaintiffs. At the \noutset, both classes will be comprised of: \nall persons who, when they under the age of eighteen years old, were charged with \nminor offenses and were, pursuant to JDC policy, strip searched and/or subjected to \nquestioning about theirreligious beliefs at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention \nCenter from June 1, 1999 through September 14, 1999. \nThe first class will be comprised of all such persons seeking injunctive relief. The second class will \nbe comprised of all such persons seeking compensatory and/or punitive damages.

After Plaintiffs' petition for a writ of \ncertiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court on March 26, 2007, Plaintiffs filed with \nthis Court a Motion for Leave to  Substitute Class Representatives.  (Doc.  165.)  Defendants \nrequested an opportunity to conduct discovery to determine if the substitute class representatives \nproposed by Plaintiffs are proper.  Subsequently, Plaintiffs served Defendant Minnehaha County \nwith discovery requests and asked Defendant to supplement responses to earlier served discovery. \nCounsel for Defendants informed Plaintiffs that it will not respond to Plaintiffs' discovery requests \nuntil this Court rules on Plaintiffs' Motion to Substitute Class Representatives. Plaintiffs then filed \na Motion to Compel discovery.  (Doc. 178.)  Shortly thereafter, Defendants filed a Motion for \nProtective Order, asking the Court to stay discovery until the Court rules on Plaintiffs' Motion to \nSubstitute Class Representatives.  (Doc. 182.) \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 185    Filed 10/25/07   Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 1380\nPlaintiffs  acknowledge  that,  pursuant to  the  Eighth Circuit's decision,  the  claims  for \ninjunctive relief must be dismissed for lack of an Article III case or controversy and Smook's \nindividual claim for damages against Minnehaha County, Jim Banbury and Todd Cheever must be \ndismissed. Furthermore, the Eighth Circuit directed this Court to consider whether the class should \nbe redefined or decertified and whether there is an adequate class representative to replace Smook, \nif appropriate. \nPlaintiffs correctly  note  that,  in  ruling  that Smook has  no  claim for  damages  against \nDefendants,  the  Eighth  Circuit  found  significant  the  fact  that  she  was  permitted  to  wear \nundergarments during the search.  Although Plaintiffs' proposed Amended Complaint names as \nsubstitute class representatives three individuals who, unlike Smook, were not allowed to wear \nundergarments during the search, Plaintiffs discuss redefining the class on page 3 of Plaintiffs' \nReply in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Substitute Class Representative.  In light of the \nEighth Circuit's opinion, the class certified to seek monetary damages will have to be redefined. 1 \nThe Court's prior numerosity finding might change if the class is smaller than it was when the Court \nissued its initial certification order. \nIn addition, before granting Plaintiffs' motion, the Court must ensure that the substitute class \nrepresentatives proposed by Plaintiffs meet the commonality, adequacy and typicality requirements \nof Rule 23(a).  Limited discovery will be allowed to ensure that these requirements are met.  Other \ndiscovery will be stayed pending completion of class discovery.  At the completion of the limited \nclass discovery, Plaintiffs should re-file their motion to substitute class representatives.  Plaintiffs' \nrenewed motion should include a proposed class definition, and Plaintiffs should explain how they \nnow meet the four prerequisites for the maintenance of a class action under Rule 23(a).  In their \n'The class seeking monetary damages is currently defllled as: \nAll persons seeking compensatory and punitive damages in this action who, when \nthey [were] under the age of eighteen years, were charged with minor offenses from \nNovember 1,1997 to a date to be set by the Court or were charged with non-felony \noffenses from April 16, 1999 to a date to be set by the Court, and were, pursuant to \nJDC policy, strip searched at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. \n2 \n\nCase 4:00-cv-04202-LLP   Document 185    Filed 10/25/07   Page 3 of 3 PageID #: 1381\nresponse to Plaintiffs' renewed motion, Defendants should include any newly discovered facts \nrelevant to the proposed class representatives' adequacy to represent the class.  Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED: \nI.  That Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Substitute Class Representatives, doc. \n165, is denied without prejudice. \n2.  That Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel, doc. 178, is denied. \n3.
